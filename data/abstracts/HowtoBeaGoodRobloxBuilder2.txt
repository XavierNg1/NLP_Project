Had enough of basic building?,
Found a plugin you like?,
Launch Roblox Studio.
When Studio starts, you will be given a web browser inside the studio.
Still inside the studio browser, go to your profile and scroll to the bottom.
Click on the icon or name of the plugin you favorited.
After Studio finishes restarting, right-click the toolbars along the top - there should be a new, unchecked toolbar.

Look in your local PennySaver or YellowBook.
Look up each contractor on the Internet, and see if they have reviews.
Call the contractor during business hours.
Make an appointment for the estimate.
At you appointment, note several things: was the contractor on time, and if he was going to be late, did he/she call?,
Thank the contractor, and inform him that either you'd like to think about it, or you'd like him to do the job.
If you've agreed to have the work done, keep a weather-eye on the contractor.
If you're unsure about the subject of chimney repair and cleaning, don't be shy about researching the topic first.

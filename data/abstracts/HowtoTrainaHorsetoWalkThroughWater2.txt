Prepare the tarp for the horse.
Lead the horse onto the tarp.Stand on one side of the horse.
Trade the tarp with actual water.Once your horse can comfortably walk across the tarp with two cones on each side, remove the tarp and bring the horse to a large shallow body of water about three feet (one meter) deep.
Start small.Before riding through water of any significant depth or distance, you should walk your horse through lots of shallow water.

Target only one behavior at a time.
Talk with the child about the behavior, if possible.
Keep a log, if you can't ask the child.
After keeping this log for several days to a week, try to identify the cause of the behavior.
Fix the underlying problem.
If the problem behavior does not decrease, then you have not found the right solution yet, or they are not developmentally ready.
See what happens.
Celebrate their initiative.

Play according to your position.
Get a feel for the other players at the table.
If everyone is folding when you get a big hand, you will need to mix up your game.
When you get to the bubble (one position from the money) or four players left, try to make your move before getting short-stacked.
Instead of becoming desperate, steal some pots.
Pay attention to the player stack amounts.
The $5 and $50 Sit n go's are much different.
If you're going to play in the $50 Sit and Go's make sure your game is sharp.
Some players find the higher stakes games to be easier than the lower stakes ones because the players are more predictable.

,Play tight against loose players and loose against tight players

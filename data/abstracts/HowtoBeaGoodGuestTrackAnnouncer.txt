Before this, go to a race and experience it for yourself.Next, when the opportunity arrives, get to the track early and ask to meet with the announcer

,
Go over the horses names that will be racing in each race and write down their pronunciation, though many are fairly easy to say.

,
Practice, practice, practice.
If the original announcer is with you, get your cues from him on when to say different things before the actual race.
Adjust the binoculars; all track announcers will use binoculars, whether they hold them in their hands or if they are on a tripod.
Stay calm.
During the race, read quickly, (not like an auctioneer) but clearly so the people can understand what's happening.

,
In between races, stay hydrated.
At the end of all the races, thank the people for coming and to drive safe.

Choose a simple block shape to sew.

You'll need two sizes of squares, one an inch (2.5cm) bigger all around than the other.
Center a batting square on the "wrong" side of your larger backing square.

Sew the seam.

Press the seam open and place the next block piece in the same manner, lining up the edges, sewing the seam, pressing open, until you reach the edges of the block.



Turn the inch (2.5cm) wide, unquilted border section of the block sandwich under the block out of the way.
Repeat for all four sides.Sew rows of blocks together in this manner.
Sew the rows together, stitching the flap edges together, and then pressing them open and top stitching the entire row.

Roll the outside edges over and top stitch to finish the edge.

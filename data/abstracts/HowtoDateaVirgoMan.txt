If you're interested in a Virgo man, be friends with him first.
Get him to respect you.
Be forward.
Get ready for perfection.
Expect class.
Keep your look simple.
Be clean and tidy.
Don't be extravagant and wasteful.
Be stable.
Be ready to be pleased.
Know that he's an Earth sign.
Know that he may need reassurance.
Don't think of him as a know-it-all.
Understand his hesitancy to act.
Know he's more practical than poetic.

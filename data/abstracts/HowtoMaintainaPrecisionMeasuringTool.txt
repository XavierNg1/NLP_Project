Be sure that the work pieces have stopped.
Wipe the measuring faces of a precision measuring tool and the to-be-measured surface of the work piece so as to prevent the measuring accuracy from being negatively affected by dirt or dust.
Never put precision measuring tools together with hand tools, such as cutting tools, files, hammers and drills for the fear of bumping the precision measuring tools.
Use your tools for their purpose.
Maintain temperature.
Be aware of the immediate area.
When having discovered some abnormal phenomena on a precision measuring tool, such as rough surface, burr, rusts, distortion of the body or ineffective movements, users should not be allowed to fix it on their own, not to mention fix it with hammers, files or emery cloth for the fear of augmenting errors.
Users should clean the tools after use.
Periodic maintenance should be applied to precision measuring tools.

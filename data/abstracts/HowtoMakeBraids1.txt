Prep your hair.
Gather your hair into a ponytail.
Separate your hair into three equal sections: left, right, and middle.
Cross the right section over the middle section of hair.
Cross the left section over the middle section.
Continue this pattern (right over middle, left over middle) until you reach the end of the ponytail.

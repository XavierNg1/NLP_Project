When you find out your Sim is pregnant, start building a bedroom for the baby.
When the baby is born, feed it, change their diaper, and put them in a crib, keep up with it's needs.
When your baby ages up to a toddler, potty train them, and teach them to walk and talk.
Give your toddler plenty of attention.
When your toddler becomes a child, they can do almost everything by themselves.
Keep in mind that if a child, toddler, or baby isn't fed properly, the social worker will come and take him/her away.

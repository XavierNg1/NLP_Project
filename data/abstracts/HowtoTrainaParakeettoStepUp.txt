If your parakeet's cage isn't already there, move it to a busy place of the house so that it will get used to your household.
Spend a little time each day next to your budgie's cage, letting it get used to you being near it.
Soon your parakeet will get used to this.
Start putting your hand in the cage and offering it millet spray.
When your parakeet doesn't fly away from your hand as much, then take a perch from the cage.
Start finger training if your bird is ready to.
Leave the perch where it's at.
Once you have successfully trained your parakeet to step up, take it out of the cage for the first time(if you haven't already).

Decide whether you want to "show bunt" or not.
As the pitcher gets into the stretch, start moving into your bunting stance.
Turn your back foot towards the pitcher as your square up to bunt.
Pull your bat back if the pitch isn't a strike.
Angle your bat in the direction you want to place the bunt.
Bend at the knees to make contact with the ball instead of dropping your bat.
Keep your eye on the ball as it comes in to the plate.
Pull the bat back slightly right before the ball makes contact.
Try to make contact with the ball on the lower part of the barrel, sending the ball down into the ground instead of up into the air.
Be careful about bunting with two strikes.
As soon as you make contact with the ball, explode out of the batter's box toward first base.

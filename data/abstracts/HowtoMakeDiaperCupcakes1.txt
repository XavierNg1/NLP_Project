Open up the diaper, so that it is a long strip, and position it horizontally.
Fold the diaper in half lengthwise.
Start rolling the diaper tightly from one end to the other.
Wrap a rubber band around the middle of the diaper to hold it together.
Gently push on the bottom of the roll to form the peak, if needed.
Tie a ribbon around the rubber band to hide it.
Place the cupcake in a cupcake wrapper.
Place a baby hair clip or hair tie on top of the cupcake, if desired.
Consider making more diaper cupcakes and displaying them.

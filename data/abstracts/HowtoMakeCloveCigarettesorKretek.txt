Gather your looseleaf tobacco and whole cloves.
Start to prepare the cloves for inclusion.
Do not worry if the petal-ball breaks in half or thirds - this is actually good.
Take the leftover calyx/sepal section and place them in your mortar and pestle/coffee grinder/rocks and ground.
Mix it all up with the amount of tobacco you have chosen.
Done!,
Get practically any liquid - coffee, tea, orange blossom or rose water, extracts such as vanilla and almond, and alcohol all work and taste very nice!,
Let your mixture sit for 1-3 hours, possibly more.
Spread the mixture onto a cookie sheet to dry in your oven with only the pilot light.
Final product!,
If you are using an injector, stay away from the cheap hand held.
Real clove cigarettes DO NOT use saccharine!

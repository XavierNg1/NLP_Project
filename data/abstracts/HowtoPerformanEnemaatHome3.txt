Understand what a retention enema is.
Since you will be retaining this enema for longer than the cleansing enema, be sure that any ingredients you use won't be harmful.
Follow the same procedure — as featured in the cleansing enema section — of drawing the enema solution, inserting the solution, and removing the nozzle.
Instead of letting the body void naturally, hold the enema solution inside the rectum for 5 to 15 minutes.
Once your time is up, move over to the toilet and void the enema.

Prep your hair.
Gather your hair into a low, half-up, half-down ponytail.
Wrap a clear hair tie around the upper ponytail.
Flip the upper ponytail to make a topsy-turvy ponytail.
Add a small section of hair to each side of your ponytail.
Create another topsy-turvy ponytail.
Repeat the process until you reach the end of your hair.
Tie all of your hair off with a hair tie.
Fluff up your braid, if desired.

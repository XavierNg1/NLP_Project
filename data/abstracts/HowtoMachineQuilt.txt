Get everything ready:


Clean the machine and make sure it is kept at room temperature.
Think about the look you are trying to achieve.
Use a walking foot, if available.
Loosen the top tension – you do not want the bobbin thread to show.
Drop the feed dogs or cover with masking tape if necessary.

,
Use a darning foot or no foot.
Place your work in an embroidery hoop and set drum tight, tighten the screw with the flat section of the hoop against the machine bed, or hold tightly in your hands.
Use the needle as a pencil.
Have some scrap paper and a pencil beside you and work the ideas on paper first – you’re trying to get the brain to use the needle as a pencil!,
Look for PATTERNS that occur in nature – animal markings, wood grain, marble, water reflections etc!,
As you become more confident, work without a grid and try to work continuous patterns.
On ‘whole cloth’ quilting, try voiding shapes as well as filling shapes.
On patchwork, think about filling different areas or imposing an all over pattern.

,
Use a printed fabric for backing and stitch the outlines of the pattern from the back and then quilt in the areas from the front – this works well with large scale furnishing fabrics.

,
Use a free zigzag stitch to create fill patterns.

Define electronic reactions.
Be aware of the history of this branch of organic chemistry.
Study the versatility of these reactions.
Study the sigmatropic shifts.
Study conjugated double bonds.
Study the correlation diagram, which is important for the understanding of how electrocyclic reactions proceed.
Note that electrocyclic reactions are mostly thermodynamically driven due to the formation of a sigma bond instead of an existing double bond.
Study the electrocyclic reactions kinetically.

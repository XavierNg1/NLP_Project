Keep in mind that although many people have a thousand expectations for you, ultimately you are the one who makes the decisions.
Prioritize.
Set aside a time to do your coursework and stick to it.
Look at your syllabus.
If you find that you're dragging at work (or school), you might not be getting enough sleep.
Find something you like about your job.
Try not to let your mind wander too much while at work.
Talk to your boss.
Have fun when you can.

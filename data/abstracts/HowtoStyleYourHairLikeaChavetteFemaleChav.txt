First, shampoo and condition your hair.
Blow-dry your hair.
If your hair is long, straighten it.
If your hair is short, don't panic.
Brush your hair fully, then straighten out all the leftover kinks.
Start to brush your hair into a ponytail.
When your hair is in a high ponytail, hairspray it.
'Bump' up your fringe.
All done!

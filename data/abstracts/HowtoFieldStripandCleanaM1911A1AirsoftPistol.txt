On the left side of your gun look for the notch that releases the slide.
On the slide itself you'll see two notches on the left side of the slide.
On the barrel at the very front of the gun is something called a "bushing".
Carefully slide the slide forward it should come right off.
Use a silicon lubricant, preferably sprayed, around the parts you have dissembled.
Take a q-tip and rustle the ends with your fingers until it's really fluffy.
Time to reassemble.
Insert the spring into the bottom of the barrel.
Carefully slide the slide back into the handle.
Almost done.

Gather all the equipment you need.
Brainstorm ideas.
Draw a light line for the umbrella's rod, and another smaller one for it's spike.
Draw the ground and then the outline of the umbrella.
With dots, mark the place where the metal rods in your umbrella will go.
Draw lines connecting the dots you drew in the previous step, and a straight line in the middle.
Draw the bottom of the umbrella.
All the previous drawings should have been drawn lightly, so now outline everything you drew but this time pressing the pencil down harder.

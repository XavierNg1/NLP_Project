Decide how you are going to keep your Book of Shadows.
Lay down a statement of your beliefs.
Write down any rituals or spells you have created, step by step.
Write down any rituals or spells you perform as well as influences such as moon phases etc, and what the results are.
Include chants, poetry, stories, artwork, etc, whether created by yourself or others.
All BOS need to have correspondence pages.
It may be a good idea to keep a table of contents so that you can find things easily in your BOS.

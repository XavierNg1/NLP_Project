Allow the blossom and the leaves to completely fade on their own.
Snip off the blossom (if you haven't done so already) and the withered leaves right at the soil line.
Dig deep into the soil several inches away from where the bulb is located.
Clean off the bulb by brushing excess soil away with your fingers.
Examine the bulbs for any signs of rot, deterioration or damage that may have been caused by nibbling critters.
Set the bulb aside in open air for a short period of time (usually about an hour) until the last bit of soil has dried.
Loosely place the bulbs into a well-ventilated bag.
Hang the bulb-filled bag in an area that will not be exposed to direct sunlight, heat or dampness.
Allow the bulbs to cure.
Examine the bulbs again before replanting them.

Decorate your house for Halloween as usual.
Set up a crate at the start of your path that leads to your front door.
On Halloween night, dress yourself up like a scary zombie or ghoul.
Before trick-or-treaters start to come to your door, hide in the crate.
When trick-or-treaters begin to come, act natural.
After the trick-or-treaters come merrily down from your cutesy house with their candy and have happily skipped about halfway down your driveway, jump out from your crate.

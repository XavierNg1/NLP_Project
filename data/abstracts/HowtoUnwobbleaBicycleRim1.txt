Flip bike upside down, or put the wobbly wheel in a truing stand if you have one.
Locate the bend in the rim by noting where the wheel comes nearer to the brakes.
Understand how spokes are tightened and turned.
Grip the spokes around your problem area and squeeze lightly, checking for looseness.
Note which side each spoke pulls towards to find the ones causing your wobble.
Tighten the spoke just below your problem area with a half-turn of the nipple.
Loosen the two spokes next to the one you just tightened, using only quarter-turns.
Spin the wheel and check the truing.
Continue this 3-spoke adjustment process until the wobble is gone.
Check for "flat spot" wobbles, or a bike that is not "radially" true.

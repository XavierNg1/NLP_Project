Have an idea about what you want your doll to look like.
Create your doll using a paper pattern first.
Select a fabric and fold it in half, right sides together.Use the pattern to trace around the shape using a pencil line,
After you remove the pattern, cut the figure shape out carefully leaving a 1/4" allowance for a sewing seam.
Sew the two layers of fabric together by hand or by machine.
Add a face if desired.
Add details and designs.

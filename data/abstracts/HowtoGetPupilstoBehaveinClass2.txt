Think of a prize.
Pick the 'secret student':


If you are doing the prize for the grade, ask the homeroom teacher(s) to participate in this and pick the student during homeroom.
Tell your class that one of them has been selected.
Monitor the student throughout the day/lesson.
The next day/lesson, if the selected student has overall acted good in the lesson, announce the student to the class.

To catch a wide variety of fish, use a small hook.
Choose a name brand hook like Mustad or Eagle Claw, because their hooks are strong and proven.
Use a short shank hook for its strength and a long shank hook for easy removal of the hook from the fish.
Use the long shank hook for small fish or pan sized fish.
Use the straight hook, also known as the standard hook, for a wide range of styles and fish.
Use a circular hook for still bait fishing.
Used the AH hook for its spaciousness in placing a bait on it.
Use care when using treble hooks.
Enjoy the outdoors and fish with top water plugs, because their treble hooks will not snag on the bottom.
Depending on the type of fishing you do, choose the right eye.
For trolling with artificial lures or bait, always use a sharp, medium shank, straight hook.

Keep moving.
Know where the linebackers are.
If a hit is completely inevitable, then you need to deliver the hit instead of letting that big linebacker or safety hit you!,
When avoiding tackles, faking moves - juking, isn't necessarily the the best choice.
If you're a bigger running back, sometimes it's better to mow the defender over rather than dodging around him.

Decide on the date of your swap party and invite everyone that you think would have some cool clothes.
Make up 3 "value spots" on a table or on the floor.
Create tickets for each pile (about 20 for each).
When your partygoers arrive, tell them to put each item they have in the value spot that they think suits it best.
Once everyone has arrived, tell the party to put their tickets into a box.

,
Put some cool music on to keep a festive mood going.

,
Get the box of tickets and shake them all up.
Each ticket you pick will say a name and have the colour of a value spot.
When Emily has chosen her item she sits down and the cycle repeats.

Measure 12" from the top right and left edges in (toward the middle) and 12" down from those two top corners; draw lines between the marks to cut off the corners using the circular saw.
Measure from the sides of the backboard near the top and the bottom to find the center, and draw a vertical line down.

,
Measure up from the bottom of the backboard (in the center) 2" and make a mark.
Lay the backboard on the 4" x 4" (with the cut corners at the top).
Using the 1-5/8" exterior screws and the power drill with the phillips bit, screw the backboard to the 4" x 4".
Place the hoop in position on the backboard again, and trace inside the holes in the square.
Place the hoop in position again, and put a washer on a lag screw, then screw the lag screw into one of the holes, using the adjustable wrench.
Attach the net to the hoop.

Get help for this part; two more people will help prevent accidents.
At the mark you just made, position one of the gusset angles so that the corner of it lines up with this mark and the bottom goes out.
Again, get help and be careful for this last step!,
Play ball!

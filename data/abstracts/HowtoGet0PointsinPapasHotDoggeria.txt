Know that you already start out with 1 sausage, bun, drink, and snack, so you will need to complete a few days in order to get 1 more sausage and bun type.
Decide how you want to achieve your goal: get 0 points.
Start the day and wait until all the customers for that day arrive and the shop closes.
When the last one arrives, time about 10 minutes.
Look at the customer's order.

,
Give them a different kind of sausage from what they actually want.
Take off the sausage straight away making sure it is raw.
Put the sausage you just took off the griller in a bun.
Here just press next, don't put anything as a topping.

,
With the drink if the customer ordered a fizzo, give them nothing.
Do the same for the popcorn.

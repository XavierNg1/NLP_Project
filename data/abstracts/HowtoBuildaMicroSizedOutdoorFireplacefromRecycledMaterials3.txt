On the second can, make two marks on the opposite sides of the can a little more than one inch from the top.
Insert the steel wire through one hole and thread it out the other.
Take one of the cut out can bottoms from earlier and cut two slivers off of it, forming a more oblong shape.
Mix up some high-temperature epoxy (about two peas' worth).
Once the epoxy is cured, place the can with the steel wire (the damper segment) on top of the cut-out can with the sardine tin (the firebox segment).
Align the damper segment so that the longer part of the steel wire points the same direction as the firebox opening.
Remove the damper segment and squeeze a very generous ribbon of the high-temp silicone sealant around the top of the firebox segment.
Straighten the damper segment to line up with the firebox segment and allow the sealant to cure as stated on the instructions.

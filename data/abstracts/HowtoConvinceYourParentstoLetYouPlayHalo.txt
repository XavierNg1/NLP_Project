Tell them that research has shown that narrative-based video simulations will help you learn problem-solving skills.
Find out the reason why they won't let you play it; if it's because you're in the USA and are under 17, show them the game.
Tell them something along the lines of, "It's educating me, I would know more about anatomy.",
Keep your cool.
Present your argument.
Be nice, but firm.
Promise that it won't stop you from doing homework or anything like that.
Introduce them to the game.
If they don't want you to play it at all, get "Halo Wars" because that is rated T for teen by the ESRB.

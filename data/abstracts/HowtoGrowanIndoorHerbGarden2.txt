Buy some herbs from your local nursery.
Choose a pot that is two to three times larger than the pot your herb came in.
Make sure that the pot has drainage holes at the bottom.
Fill the pot with high-quality, organic potting soil.
Pull the herb out of its pot, along with the soil it came in.
Place the herb into a pot and water it.
Keep the herb in a shady spot for the first few days before moving it to a sunnier location.

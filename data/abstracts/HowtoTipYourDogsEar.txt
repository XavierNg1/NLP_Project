Get your equipment ready and within reaching distance.
Place your dog on the surface area that you will be using.
Brush out the ear that you would like to start on.
Test the ear with your comb.
Hold your dog's ear with your thumb over the top of the ear and your other fingers under it, forcing the ear to lay flat against them.
With your good hand, hold your clippers like a pencil and turn them on.
Bring your clipper down to the halfway point and gently run your clipper over the dogs ear at a constant rate and repeat till no more hair falls off (doing this too slowly or too quickly can catch the skin and cut the ear).
Flip the ear over so that the inside of the ear is facing you.
Now angle your clippers at a 45 degree against the ear and gently go down the ear again; repeat this process as necessary.
Repeat the above step but now rotate your clippers the other way by 90 degrees, removing the bulk of hair from the other side.
Repeat steps 3-10 on the adjacent ear.

Now your dog has tipped ears.

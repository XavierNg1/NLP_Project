Get a chopstick.
Use hot glue to build up the handle and wand.
Add a bead or button to the bottom of the wand.
Paint the wand a base color using acrylic paint.
Add some weathering using lighter and darker shades of your base color.
Seal the wand with a clear, acrylic sealer to make the paint last longer.

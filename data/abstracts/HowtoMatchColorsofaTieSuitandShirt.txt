Generally, try to match your shirt and tie before you worry about your suit.
When in doubt, pick a neutral, solid-colored dress shirt.
For a bolder (but more difficult) look, choose a pastel or bold-colored shirt.
Pick a striped or patterned shirt for complex color interactions.
Pick a tie that's darker than your shirt.
For solid-color ties, pick a color that fits your purpose.
For patterned ties, pick a tie containing a color that's similar to your shirt's.
Avoid picking ties with patterns that are the same as your shirt's.
Opt for "serious", formal colors.
When in doubt, opt for dark, solid-color suits.
Consider lighter solid-color suits for use with pastels and dark ties.
Avoid pairing a patterned suit with a similarly-patterned shirt or tie.
Try to choose a suit that keeps the number of colors in your outfit to no more than three.

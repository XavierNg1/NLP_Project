Avoid bringing anything unnecessary to your trip or that you will be upset to lose when traveling.
If you have valuables with you when you're traveling, ask the hotel staff to lock them in the general safe.
Never leave items lying around in your room exposed for the housekeeping staff to see, or for people to see through your windows.
If possible, lock your hotel room door, windows, and balcony doors (if applicable) whenever you leave the room and before you go to sleep.
Don't be flamboyant with your wealth.

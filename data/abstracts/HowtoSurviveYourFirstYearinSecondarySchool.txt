Be nice, polite, and friendly!,
Meet as many people as you can.
Do your best in all classes, but don't try to be a "teacher's pet" or be overly nice to the "popular crowd.",
If you have a uniform, keep it looking nice.
Put in the time to make good grades.
Don't worry about all the gossip and relationships talk.
Don't be shy; be confident, and love yourself for who you really are.
Be Respectful to your teachers, even the ones you don't like.
Stay organized.
You only get one first impression, make it a good one.

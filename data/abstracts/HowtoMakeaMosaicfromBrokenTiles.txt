Get an idea in your head of what kind of mosaic you would like to make.
Head over to your local hardware or floor store and select and buy the tiles you would like to use.
With your safety glasses and protective gloves on, throw your tiles at any hard object, or simply drop them.
Gather your broken tiles into color categories.
Now it comes time to make the mosaic.
Take your pieces and slide them into the wooden frame (if not already there).
Now, individually glue each piece into place with the tile adhesive.








,
Once the tiles have set, mix up the cement with water until it is of the consistency described on the cement bag (liquid but not runny).
Using a soft cloth, rub off the excess cement that covers the tile pieces.








,
You now have a beautiful Mosaic!

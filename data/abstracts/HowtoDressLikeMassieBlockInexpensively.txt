Massie dresses very maturely, as well as cute and chic.
The best places to shop are Macy's (if you can afford it), Charlotte Russe, H&M, Abercrombie and Fitch, Nordstroms, Wet Seal, and other stores or websites that have gorgeous and hot couture style clothes for less.
It's essential to buy stuff that you know will go with other things, so you don't buy a red and white blazer and nothing to go with it.
Remember that Massie almost never wears pants.

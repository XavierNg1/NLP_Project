Get a short, unscented pillar candle.
Place a rubber band around the middle of the candle.
Start tucking the cinnamon sticks behind the rubber band.
Straighten the cinnamon sticks up.
Cover the rubber band by wrapping some ribbon around it.
Consider adding some embellishments for that final touch.
Use the candle.

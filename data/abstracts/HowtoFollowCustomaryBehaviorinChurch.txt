If this is your first time at a particular church, or any church for that matter, recognize that you are a guest and new to this.
Many Christian services are divided into two main components.
Get to church 5-10 minutes early and sit quietly in the pew looking over the bulletin, if possible.
Note any special instructions about standing or kneeling.
Note that most of the standing and kneeling comes as a response to something in the service.
Note that if communion/Eucharist is being served, carefully read the bulletin or ask someone close by how exactly it works in this church.
Following customary behavior takes practice.
Try to relax.

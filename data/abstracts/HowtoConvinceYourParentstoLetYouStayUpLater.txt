Help around the house.
Do your chores on time.
Make sure you spend some quality time with your parents.
Join your parents on outings.
Respect their wishes.
Don't push it by expecting to stay up past a certain hour -- like staying up all through the night.
Do NOT complain about waking up in the morning.
Otherwise, just go with the flow.
Another important point is to wake up with energy.

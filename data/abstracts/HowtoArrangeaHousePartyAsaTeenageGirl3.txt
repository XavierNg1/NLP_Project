Keep your drinking to a bare minimum.
Play good music that everyone can enjoy, preferably what your friend group normally listens to.
Be sociable!,
If something does, sadly, get broken, or someone makes a mess of a room, don't fret.
If there aren't too many people, perhaps suggest a game of spin the bottle, dares, postman's knock or seven minutes in heaven.
When the party dies down, and most of the people have left, there will definitely be a five or six people hanging around.

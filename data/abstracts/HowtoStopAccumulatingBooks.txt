Reflect on how many is too many.
Cull your existing collection.
If a book has a few interesting gems of advice but it otherwise not worth keeping, make notes of the few interesting tidbits from the books, save those tidbits in a file for future reference and inspiration, then give away the book.
Reference books.
Make a rule that you will read X number of books you currently own before buying another one.
Make a “syllabus” of books to read.
Make a "to buy" list.
To keep your book collection from growing any bigger: If you buy a book, immediately get rid of a book you already have.
Use the library: most library systems will lend you books from anywhere in their system.
Use the library for downloading e-books: many libraries offer an e-resource service that allows you to download ebooks to your computer gratis.
Purchase and collect your books on an e-Book reader (like Kindle Wireless).
If you have room for them and you still think "I'm going to read (or re-read) that someday", keep them.

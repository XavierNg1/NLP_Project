Seek inspiration from sample eating patterns in the guide.
Get colorful with your vegetable choices.
Focus on eating a range of whole fruits.
Choose a variety of lean proteins.
Target low-fat dairy and whole grains with your choices.
Understand the new guidance on added sugar.
Keep cutting back on saturated fat and processed meats.
Stay vigilant with your sodium consumption.

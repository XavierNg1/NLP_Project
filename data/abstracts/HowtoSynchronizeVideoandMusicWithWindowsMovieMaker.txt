Open Windows Movie Maker.
Take the time to upload the audio file you have chosen.
Now that you’ve added your music, take some time to look at the sound wave bars that the music creates.
Add your video file into the project in a similar way to how you added your music.
Most videos you put in will already have an audio file associated with them, mute this audio track, so it does not overlay with the song you have picked.

,
Choose whether you would like to add the entire video, or individually add clips as you move through the song.
If there is a brief moment of silence at the start of your video, you may want to try a fade in.
Once you have your intro finished you can begin editing in your next clip.
If you would like to split the video clip you are currently using, simply press the “M” key.
In order to make your two clips fit in correctly you can either shorten or lengthen them or change their speeds.
Select the new clip you’d like to merge, and drag it together with the previous clip (just like in step 7) to create a simple, synced fade transition between two clips.
At the red circle there is a drum beat that you would like to sync to.
One more technique you can use is the creation of a simple black or white flash.
Split your clips directly on the beat, as opposed to right after it for the transition.

,
Now right click the first clip and open the “Effects” menu again.
Right click on the second clip, bring up “Effects” again, and this time select the corresponding “Fade In from Black” or “Fade In from White” effect.
With these two basic techniques, you can create some pretty interesting effects from rapid flashes, to long peaceful transitions, all in sync with music of your choice.

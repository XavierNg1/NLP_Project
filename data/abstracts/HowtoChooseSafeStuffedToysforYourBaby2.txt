Buy nontoxic stuffed toys.Since your baby will surely put the stuffed toy in their mouth and handle it endlessly, you must provide your baby with nontoxic stuffed toys.
Ensure the stuffed toy is flame resistant.While checking the care label or the box the stuffed toy is packaged in, look for confirmation that the toy is “flame resistant” or “flame retardant.” This means that the toy will not catch fire easily.

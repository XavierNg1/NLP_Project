Gather polaroid film (Polaroid SX-70) and a polaroid camera (one that uses Polaroid SX-70 film).
Insert film into the camera.

Find an appropriate subject for a photo.
As the polaroid begins to develop, use a bluntly pointed tool (bone scraper, the non-business end of a paintbrush, a non working ballpoint pen, a butter knife) to etch and delineate areas you'd like to highlight in your composition.
Consider taking the polaroid apart and removing sections of the image.
Once you have removed the clear top layer (to which the photo should adhere), continue manipulating the photo by using the same blunt-tipped tools, as well as any other scraping tools you prefer, to remove and highlight additional parts of the image.
When you have sufficiently manipulated your polaroid to your liking, replace the black backing of the polaroid as a protective covering by gluing or taping around the edges.

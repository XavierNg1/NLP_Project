Plan ahead.
Bring laundry supplies.
Many US hotels have their own self-service laundries.
Keep alternatives in mind.
Watch your timing.
Shower first.
Plan where you will hang the laundry before you get anything wet.
Place the sink stopper (plug) in the drain.

,
Add laundry and soap, shampoo, or detergent, as you fill the sink with cool or warm water.

,
Wash the clothes by moving them around in the soapy water.
Rub the fabric against itself gently to help the soap do its job.

,
Drain the soapy water out of the sink and squeeze the laundry gently to get most of the soap out.

,
Refill the sink with clean water to rinse the laundry.
Drain the sink again and let the laundry drip out for a few moments.

,
Squeeze out excess water with your hands.
Lay the damp garments in a single layer on a bath towel.

,
Roll the towel around them and squeeze to remove most of the excess water, or put the rolled towel on the floor and walk back and forth on it.
Hang the clothes to dry.
Hang the towel to dry also.

,
Dry garments the rest of the way.

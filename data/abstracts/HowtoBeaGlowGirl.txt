Find as many things as possible that glow in the dark.
Wear anything bold and flashy.
Wear glow bracelets, glow necklaces, glow body paint, and glow socks.
Consider wearing makeup, if you want to.
Be happy forever!,
Listen to Happy Hardcore and Techno.
Never ever curse.
If you have nappy hair, make it into an afro!,
If you're not dancing, talk to your friends and be random and quirky.
Make your room a glow in the dark paradise.

Go to the third tab of the workbook called "Setting and Results" to change a few things before getting started.
Under profiles, change one of the existing profiles to a name of your choice.
Move over to the fifth tab called "Gear.",
This should now populate all the fields with the gear you were wearing when you logged out last.
Load your talent spec on the "Talents" tab by clicking the "Read from Armory" button.
Move on to the "Shot Rotation" tab, which can be one of the most useful tools in the entire spreadsheet.
You can easily experiment with different rotations to determine what would best maximize your DPS.
Select your current level of progression on the "Gear Planner" tab.
One of the nice additions that came with the Gear Planner tab is how Cheeky's lists items on the Gear tab.
Play around with the other tabs.

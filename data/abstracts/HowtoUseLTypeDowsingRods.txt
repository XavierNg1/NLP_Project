You should be in a relaxed state of mind when dowsing.
Grasp your "L" rods in the palms of your hands, curling your fingers and thumb around the plastic sleeves lightly, yet firmly.
With the rods correctly griped, place your elbows along the side of your body for stability, and extend your lower arms and the rods straight out/pointing forward, roughly at shoulders length.
Now that your arms are in the search position as noted above, and the rods in a neutral position, slowly walk around the search area while concentrating on the item you are looking for.
Congratulate yourself once you are successful in your finds.

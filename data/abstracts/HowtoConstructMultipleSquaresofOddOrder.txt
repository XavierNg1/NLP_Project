The right hand side 7x7 square illustrates the rule using alphabets.
Give specific values to A’s and a’s.
To put it differently, you can start with the center square in the last column and get this 7x7 square:


12 04 45 37 29 28
03 44 36 35 27 19
43 42 34 26 18 10
41 33 25 17 09 01
32 24 16 08 07 48
23 15 14 06 47 39
21 13 05 46 38 30

This method is neat and quick.
To get multiple squares, start with the central cell of the bottom row, central cell of the first column or the last column as preferred.
Alternatively, give A’s one of the values – 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and to a’s – 0,7,14,28,35,42 – with ‘D’ being given the value 4.
To apply another method which will give an even larger number of squares -- as there is no restriction on the value to be given to the central number, take the 11x11 square by this method.
Select the values that the diagonals/rows/columns total come correctly, in cases when some of the alphabets will repeat.
Look at one of the 7x7 square by this method, with numbers from 1 to 49, with a total of 175.

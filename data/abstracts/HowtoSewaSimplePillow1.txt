Buy about one yard of fabric in a single color.
Measure a square to the size you want the pillow to be.
Take the fabric and match the sides that you want to show facing each other on the inside.
Sit at the sewing machine or grab your needle.
Leave about 3 inches (7.6Â cm) of the fabric open (which means don't sew that part).
Turn the stitched pillow inside out.
Fill the pillow with stuffing.
Sew the opening closed with a needle and thread.
Finished.

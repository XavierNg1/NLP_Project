Take wet wipes for your face.
Don't buy lunch, bring it packed in a cool pack.
Stay Safe.
Make sure all your money is in your wallet, not in your tent.
If you're crowdsurfing be very careful.
If you are staying until Monday morning (this is possible at Roskilde), don't go too far away from your tent, or at least take all your belongings out of it.
Put a brightly coloured ribbon around your tent to know where yours is.
Take plenty of dry clothes!,
Most importantly do not be tempted to try any drugs regardless of what other people say.
Don't get too wasted, you will forget your experience and wake up with a banging hangoverÂ :(.

,
Keep a mobile (cellphone) with you at all times.

,
Never expect an on-site cashpoint.
Last but not least, have fun!

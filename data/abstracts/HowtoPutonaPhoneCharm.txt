Take your phone charm out of the box or packet that it is currently in.
Find a table or a flat surface to work on putting your phone charm on.
Take off any phone cases or phone protectors.
Now, with your hopefully case-free phone, here is what you do: Locate the two holes on the upper right or upper left part of your phone.
This next part is a little tricky.
Now, you should have the end of the string through and it should be made into a big loop.
Take the big loop and loop it over you phone charm.
Pull it through.
Put back any cases or protectors and have fun having your phone look great with it's new phone charm!

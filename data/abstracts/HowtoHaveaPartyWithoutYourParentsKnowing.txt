Planning whom to invite is key.
Consider what parts of your house people will be in most of the time.
Lock doors to rooms where you don't want people, like your computer room, or parents room for example.

,
Put out food that is not too messy.
When answering the door for each person, lock it after wards.

,
Clean up while the party is happening.
When you start to become too tired, then it is time for guests to leave.

,
Ask the guests to help you clean up before they leave.
The time you should get yourself up to do the clean up will depend on the time your parents come home.
Start with all the cans and bottles, dump and throw in garbage bags to be recycled later.
Move on to general clean-up like garbage and dishes.
Check tabletops and walls for any stains or marks, and clean them if necessary.

,
Afterwards, move tables and furniture back into their original place.

,
You are done!

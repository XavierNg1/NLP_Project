To create the lip scrub, you will need: One tablespoon of white granulated sugar, one teaspoon of petroleum jelly (Vaseline), and a few drops of lemon juice.
Add the sugar, petroleum jelly, and lemon juice into the bowl.
Now, when everything is mixed up, stand near a mirror so you can see what you're doing.
Again, dip your finger into the mixture and scrub it all over your lips repeating the process.
Take the paper towel again and finally remove all of the scrub.
Finished.

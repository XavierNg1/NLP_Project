Before you start working out, come up with an exercise routine.
Start out with a set of dumbbells if you want to build muscle mass and eventually develop bulky muscles, or use resistance bands if you want to develop lean and toned muscles.
As a beginner, you should lift weights 2 to 3 times a week, and you should never lift weights for consecutive days, as your body needs rest to help muscles recover and grow.

Depending on your needs, perform exercises like dumbbell curls, overhead extensions, bench presses, shoulder presses, squats, and lunges.
Continue this routine for 2 weeks.
Perform cardiovascular activity 3 times a week; do cardio on the days when you don't lift weights.

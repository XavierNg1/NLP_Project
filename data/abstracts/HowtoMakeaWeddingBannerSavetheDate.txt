Next, cut the burlap into 8"x10" sections.
Next, cut the fabric into 9"x11" sections.
After cutting the burlap and fabric pieces out you will need the iron on adhesive strips.
Now measure side-to-side (TIP: do not overlap adhesive strips with the ones that go from top to bottom.
Before you peel off the adhesive you need to paint your date on the burlap.
After paint dries and adhesive cools (5 minutes), peel the white paper off.
Measure out ribbon in the same way you did for the adhesive strips on the top, bottom and both sides of the fabric, not the burlap!,
When all five pieces are complete with ribbon you need to take scissors and clip four holes large enough to fit your twine through.
Ta-da, you're finished!

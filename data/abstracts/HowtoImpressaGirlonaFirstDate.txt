Figure out where you want to take your date.
Decide whether or not to meet her at the place or pick her up from her house.
Consider buying her flowers.
Look good.
Consider messaging her before the date to confirm.
Put your phone on silent.
If you are picking her up, go to her door rather than texting her that you are at her house.
Open up the passenger side of the car door for her and close it once she is seated.
Open up the door for her at the restaurant, theater, or wherever else you are taking her.
If you are going to a fancy restaurant, pull back her chair for her.
During conversation, pay attention.
Ask questions which will prompt her to talk about herself.
Try to be interesting and polite.
Ask to pay for her.
Do not try to force yourself on her.
Last, but not least, be sure to correspond with her after the date to give closure.

Look at your wall and decide how large a painting you want on it.
Get a piece of paper and sketch your idea.
Go to any hobby or art supply store and buy a stretched canvas in your chosen size.

Pick up some acrylic paints in colors similar to the color theme in your room.
Spread some newspapers or a drop cloth under your canvas to protect your furniture.
Paint!,
Once you feel it's done-leave it alone!

Sales!,
If you can't wait until there are sales, then always go for the clearance rack that are around on a regular basis.
Be open minded!,
Maximizing the use of what you already have.
Look at online forums that posts announcements of sales, printable coupons, and ways to get discounts at stores you regularly frequent at.

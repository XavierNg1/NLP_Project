Listen to the sound so you know when you have it right.
Get the air moving.
Don't let your vocal chords vibrate.
Make the sound by pressing the tongue against the roof of the mouth at the point where the uvula hangs down (point 9 on the chart).
Try saying the word 'gek' which means 'crazy'.
Practice.

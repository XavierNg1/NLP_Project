The first impression.
Smell good (in this order - shower, floss, brush teeth, mouthwash, deodorant, a spritz of perfume).
Look as clean as you smell.
Stylize hair using a flat iron, curl, blow dry or just comb, then either leave it or make a do.

,
For makeup:Wear it as you wish, Don't worry about what others think if its your style, own it..

,
Do a bit of meditation in the morning, or the night before.
At school, smile, make eye contact, speak clearly, laugh, and keep your back straight to show others you are confident.
Be outgoing and while some people will come up to you, learn to approach new people.

,
While giving opinions and telling stories, let others speak and just listen every once in a while.
Don't behave nervously - don't play with hair too much, bite nails, or any other tick you might have to give off that you are nervous.

,
Branch out.

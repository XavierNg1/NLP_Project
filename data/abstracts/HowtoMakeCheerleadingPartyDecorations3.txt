Make a megaphone from paper card.
Wrap the poster board around a cone shaped object such as a plastic sand bucket, a floral styrofoam cone, or an upside down terracotta flowerpot.
While still wrapped around the cone form, decide how tall you want the megaphone to be.
Cut the plaster gauze into strips.
Allow this to thoroughly dry.
Take the megaphone off the cone form.
Once this is dry, apply several layers of a water-based sealer.

,
Paint and decorate the megaphone as desired.

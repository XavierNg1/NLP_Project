Remember that college is the first (and probably last) time you will live essentially on your own before entering "the adult work world.",
Read any dorm guidelines that your school sends you.
The most important rule of buying bedding for your dorm is getting twin extra-long sheets.
Don't get white bedding.
Buy more than one set of sheets.
Buy a mattress pad.
Take the climate of your school into account.
Instead of trying to figure out how to put a comforter in the washing machine, consider a duvet cover.
Invest in under-bed storage.
Ask your parents if they have any spare bedding things lying around.
If it's important to you, get in touch with your roommate(s) before buying bedding.

Realize this––as bride and groom, you will be too busy to be wrapped up in dealing with missing guests, angry guests, crazy guests, or guests with attitude problems.

Don’t panic if someone gets too crazy at your wedding or your reception.
Take into account the hour when the guest(s) have become unruly.

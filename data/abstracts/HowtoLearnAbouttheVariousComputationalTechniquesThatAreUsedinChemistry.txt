Computational chemistry is a branch of chemistry that deals with mathematical calculations that lead eventually to the determination of the energy and geometry of particular chemical compounds of interest to the chemist.
The most important electrons in the atom or the molecule are those that are located in the highest electronic shell or in the language of orbitals the highest occupied (HOMO) and unoccupied (LUMO) molecular orbitals.
Chemical calculations on organic compounds are part of the computational chemistry scheme.
Chemical compounds reactivity is governed by the HOMO orbital and the LUMO or the frontier molecular orbitals.
The basic equation that is used to determine the energetics of chemical compounds is the Schroedinger equation.
The Schroedinger equation is a linear differential equation that is mathematically solvable in exact manner only for simple systems such as the particle in a box and the energetics of the hydrogen atom.
For atoms other than hydrogen, solutions of the Schroedinger equation cannot be obtained mathematically in an accurate fashion due to the presence in the Hamiltonian of the Schroedinger equation a potential energy term that makes the analytical solution of the Schroedinger equation impossible.
Most calculations in chemistry involve this type of perturbation theory.
The other part of the Hamiltonian that is difficult to solve exactly is due to the spin-orbit coupling which is a relativistic effect.
In the 1990th the most well known calculation method for the chemist was the Hartree-Fock method or the self consistent field.

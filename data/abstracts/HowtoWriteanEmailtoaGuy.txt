Make sure you've got the right email address.
Look at your own email address.
If he doesn't know you then start your mail introducing yourself.
Wait!,
Now, what do you wanna write ?,
It's time to start with the interesting part of your mail.
You want to meet him alone?,
Or are you too shy to see him ?,
End your mail just with "Bye!",
Try to relax while waiting for an answer.
If you see him at school or somewhere ... - if he has answered just say "hello" and maybe talk with him longer.

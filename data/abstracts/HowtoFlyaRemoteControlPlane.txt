Decide on ready-built versus build-your-own.
Buy a remote control plane.
Build the plane (if assembly is required).
Pre-flight the plane.
Check which control stick operates which surfaces.
Do a range check... with the antenna on the transmitter collapsed, walk 50–100 feet (15.2–30.5 m) away and check that your control surfaces still respond without chattering or unwanted movements.

Determine approximate wind speed by tying a ribbon to the end of the antenna of the remote and holding the controller parallel to the ground.
Determine wind direction by throwing some grass clippings or other light material into the air.
Slowly advance the power on your aircraft and wait for it to gain sufficient speed on the ground.
Keep the throttle at 100% until the plane reaches a sufficient altitude for the size plane you're flying.
Use a very light touch.
Turn to the left or right by moving the appropriate control stick left or right.
Keep the plane as level as possible; if you raise the nose too much, it may cause a stall.
Practice an oval shaped flight pattern, keeping all turns in the same direction.
Land the airplane by first making note of the wind direction to land into the wind.
Flare just before the plane comes in contact with the ground by raising the nose at the last second so all three wheels touch at the same time.

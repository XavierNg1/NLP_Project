Grab two different colors of large construction paper, and a third color for the handle.
Cut a 1" strip from both the long and short side of one piece of paper.
Fold the larger piece of paper in half, hot dog style.
Working perpendicular to the crease, cut multiple slits along the entire folded paper.
Curl the smaller paper into a cylinder, touching the two shorter edges together.
Tape one edge of the larger, cut paper to the top of the cylinder, wrapping it all the way around.
Scrunch up the bottom of the lantern, so the cut slits point outwards, and tape the bottom edge.
Tape or staple a handle to the top of the lantern.
Optional -- hide the tape lines by gluing two strips of paper around the top and bottom edges of the lantern.

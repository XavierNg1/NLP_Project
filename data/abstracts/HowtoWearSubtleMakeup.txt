Begin with a freshly washed face.
If you have very bad acne, you may want to apply a liquid foundation, but be careful!,
(You can skip step 2 if you have pretty good skin.),
If you have light-colored skin, take an orange mineral foundation and apply to small blemishes.
Now take a mineral foundation that is the color of your skin and apply to the previous areas.
Take the foundation that is the same color of your skin and apply with a thick, stout brush to the other areas of your face.
Next, take an angled brush.
For the eyes, apply a beige or pink color to your eyelids only.
Now apply brown eyeliner to the top lid.
Apply the same brown eyeliner to the lower lid.
Apply black eyeliner to your lashes.
Apply a soft color--brown, blue mascara--to lower lashes.
Play up the lips.
Apply lip gloss over lipstick for a smooth appearance.

Finished.

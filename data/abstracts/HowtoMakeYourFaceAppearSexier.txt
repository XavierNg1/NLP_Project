Find out what is your face shape.
If your eyes are too big: For big eyes, adapt the mean girl look.
For not-high cheekbones: Apply deep shade of blush on your cheeks.
For girls with a face too long: If you have a very long face like celeb singer Cher for example, adapt a mid-length/short hairstyle with curls and bangs around your chin.
Doesn't matter what shape your face is; attitude and confidence wins people.

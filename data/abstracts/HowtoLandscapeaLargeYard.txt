Plan the project.
Draw a diagram of the entire area, to scale if possible.
Draw arrows or topographic lines.
Use the information you have gathered to look at the way you want to use the spaces in your large yard area.
Check the local nursery or home center and find out if there are fruit or nut trees, or berry producing shrubs and bushes that do well in your area.
Measure any areas where you will need to add fill material to grade and smooth the existing site.
Calculate how much fill you will need to import.
Spread the new fill material and level all areas of the yard.
Mark off any flower beds, tree plantings, or other features you are putting in your landscape, and also consider any permanent structures you may want to add now or later.
Leave some additional soil in areas where you want raised flower beds, garden areas, or other features that need it.

,
Remove plants, bushes, or undesirable trees from the area so that areas to receive grass will get maximum sunlight.

,
Plant all the shrubs, bushes, and trees that you have planned for each area, and remember, it is often easier to start working one area and finish it before moving to the next.
Lay out and install whatever irrigation piping you have planned, install conduits for underground electric to power landscape lighting and to operate pumps for fishponds or fountains you are building.
Work out your flower beds and other permanent landscape features, such as patios, permanent barbecue pits, fountains, etc.
Finish grading the areas to receive grass.
Install sod or plant your grass seed in the grassed areas, pray for rain (but not flooding), and be prepared to water sufficiently to establish your grass.

,
Add other features such benches, chairs and tables, swings and shaded tea areas.
Sit back, and allow your work to establish itself.

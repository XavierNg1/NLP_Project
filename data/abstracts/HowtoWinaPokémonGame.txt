Read the instruction booklet.
Chose your Pokémon wisely.
Also, choose a way you will defeat your challengers, two ways are having one Pokémon that is the strongest/gets to fight all the strongest trainers,this is a good method because it will have that Pokémon get the most training and all the Exp.points - then use the others as back up.
Another good method is simply train all your Pokémon equally, have them all roughly around the same level (1, 2 3 or 4 difference)however this could take long and waste a lot of time, you have to have patience and an excepting heart for constant failing Pokémon.

,
Use the grass training method.Sometimes you have to just believe in your battling skills.have an idea of what moves their Pokémon might use and never give up

If you beat the Elite Four and you become champion, go battle the Elite Four again.

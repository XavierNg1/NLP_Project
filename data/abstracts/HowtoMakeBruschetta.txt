Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C).
Slice a baguette into ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) thick slices.
Use a pastry brush to coat one side of each slice with olive oil.
Place the slices olive oil-side-down on a baking sheet.
Bake the slices on the top rack in your oven for 5 to 6 minutes.
Arrange the bruschetta oily-side-up on a platter.
Brown the garlic in a small skillet over medium-high heat.
Transfer the oil and garlic to a mixing bowl and let it cool.
Cut 2 pints of red grape tomatoes into halves.
Cut some basil into thin slices.
Add the halved tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, basil, salt, and pepper to the mixing bowl.
Wait 1 to 2 hours.
Spread the tomato mixture over the bruschetta just before serving.
Prepare some toasted slices of baguette, then add your desired topping.
Try a simple seasoning of garlic, olive oil, and salt.
Use a gorgonzola-honey topping if you like the savory-sweet.
Use ricotta cheese and marmalade for another savory-sweet combination.
Use a classic combination of salmon and cream cheese.
Try some prosciutto, peaches, and goat cheese for a more unique flavor.
If you want something zesty, give ricotta cheese and lemon a try.
If you have a sweet tooth, try strawberries and sugar.

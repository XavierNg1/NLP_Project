Cut back on unhealthy foods.
Eat "healthy snacks" as a substitute.Many people, as they aim to make diet modifications to improve their type 2 diabetes, find themselves craving snacks.
Understand why diet changes can help you to improve your blood sugars.In normal physiology, when you eat sweets or other foods with a high glycemic index (such as refined carbohydrates), your pancreas (an organ in your body) secretes insulin (a hormone) that helps to distribute the sugar into the cells of your body.

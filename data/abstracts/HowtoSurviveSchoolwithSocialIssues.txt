Understand that the only reason other people make fun of you is because they are not living with the issues you are and don't understand.
Realize that even though other students are focusing on socializing and popularity, academics are the entire reason why you're here.
If you lack the social skills needed to make friends or are uninterested in socializing, keep yourself entertained.
If you have issues with the noise level, bullying, or anything else during lunch hour, talk to any adult who will be able to help.
If you don't attend a school with recess, skip this step.
If you don't walk in hallways without your class (applies to elementary and some middle schools) skip this step.
Now that the majority of social situations are covered, all that's left are academics.
Don't allow yourself to get depressed or upset over your social differences.
Remember to make an effort to improve.

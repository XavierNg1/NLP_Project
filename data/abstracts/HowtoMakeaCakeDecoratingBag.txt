Find a flat surface, such as a large, clean cutting board, to work on.
Tear a large, rectangular piece of parchment (baking) paper off the roll.
Notice how the parchment paper rolls up on its own, if you tore if off a roll.
Place a long, clean straight edge from the top right corner to the lower left corner.
Take a sharp knife and cut across the paper, next to the straight edge.
Place the longest part of the triangle near you on the cutting board.
Hold the right corner and the apex together with your left hand.
Hold both of the corners together at top back of the cone.
Fold the tip of the cone at the very end, if you do not plan to use a metal or plastic decorating tip.
Use a spoon or spatula to scoop up frosting or chocolate.
Fold the sides at the top of the icing bag toward the center.
Snip the bottom of the bag evenly with kitchen shears, if you are not using a cake decorating tip.
Press on the top fold of the icing bag to dispense the frosting from the bottom.
Practice piping the icing onto a plate or another piece of parchment paper.

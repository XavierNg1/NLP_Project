Start out by drawing two circles.
Draw two guidelines inside both individual circles that your first drew for forming the two heads.
Under Young Anakin’s head draw a ‘Y’ shape as shown along with two lines drawn out from the lower part of the head and down to form the cloak.
Starting at each side of the guideline previously drawn for the shoulders, draw two curved ovals for the arms.
Outline the shapes over the sketches.
Erase the sketch lines and add in color.
Color in Anakin Skywalker.

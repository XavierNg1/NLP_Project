Take a break from everything.
Breathe and realize that worrying will not solve any of your problems.
Learn how to do something new.
Find something positive about any situation.
Talk it through.
Tell people when they've overstepped your boundaries.
Smile.
Sleep well.
Take things slowly - there's no need to rush!,
Play an instrument.
If none of the above works, see a professional.

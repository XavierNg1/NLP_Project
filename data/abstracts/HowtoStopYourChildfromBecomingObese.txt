Start at the beginning – give your child healthy food at an early age, and do not introduce her to unhealthy or junk food.
Don’t use food as reward for a good deed, good grades or for completing chores around the house.
Be creative when preparing healthy meals.
Avoid having chocolates, candies, or sweets around the house.
When having a meal in a restaurant or other eating place, be particular about nutrition value in the food choices of your child.
Train your child to make a habit of drinking lots of water.
Get your child to engage in sports and outdoor activities.
Help your child develop a positive self-image.
Be a role model.
Work with school officials to promote healthy food choices in the cafeteria and vending machines, and to develop ways for children to understand and appreciate the benefits of a healthy lifestyle.

You don't need a very powerful bike.
Sit comfortably, upright on the bike.
Drive at a steady pace around 1500-2000rpm.
When you are ready for liftoff, quickly open up the throttle and accelerate.
Almost immediately after accelerating, pull clutch in enough to disengage and let the engine rev to about 6000RPM.
Quickly release the clutch at about 80%.
Once you master this, your bike should be popping up a little bit.
So once again.. once comfortable with the clutch release motion, start giving it lots of throttle.
Once you get good, you won't have to rev before you clutch.
Finished.

Buy some peanuts.
Put them out in a yard.
If squirrels start coming around while you're outside, feed them the peanuts by throwing them a distance away from you.
Make it more difficult for the squirrel by putting the peanuts close to you - about a foot away.
Wait until a squirrel is close by.
Be very still and just hold the peanut out.
Remember, you are scary to the squirrel, so for a few days toss the peanut to the squirrel or just drop it close to your hand.

Gain the squirrel's.
Make a clicking sound with your mouth.
Try moving your hands around slowly - sometimes this will help.

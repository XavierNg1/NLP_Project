Pack many tampons and pads.
Ask your friend for supplies.
Wear something comfortable.
Cover up your period stains.
Bring some extra clothes.
Be prepared for menstrual cramps.
Don't think or worry too much about your period.
When changing your tampon or pad at a friends, here are some tips to make it less awkward:

If you are comfortable, confess.

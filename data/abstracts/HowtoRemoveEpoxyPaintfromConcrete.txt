There are two basic methods available: mechanical removal (which consists of sandblasting or floor disk sanding), and chemical peels.
Your choice of stripper can vary a lot depending on where you live.
Clear the surface off and wash it.
Most strippers have coverage rules and significant soak times that are required to cut through the paint bond.
Work in small areas and work towards one side of the surface.
Give the stripped area plenty of ventilation for several days.

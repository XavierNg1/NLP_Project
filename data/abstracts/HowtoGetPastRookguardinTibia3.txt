Go to the pen of animals next to the place with the character named Tom in it, and you may find some animals there (they might already be dead).
Do one of two things:

If you went for combat first...

Leave The Rookguard Town by going NORTH from Toms place and you should see some stairs go up them and you will be on a bridge go north until you see more stairs go down them and your outside of the city(NOTE you must be at least level 2 to do this)then walk Right(--->) then when you can go south (V) until you reach water then go right AGAIN until you see a raft on the coast there will be poison spiders.
Remember that the hardest part of all choosing you Vocation (job) here are the Pros and Cons of each of them:

Knight Pros: Does More Damage at lower levels uses Meele weapon(such as Kantana and carlin sword and has the highest HP out of all the vocations can get skills up higher then any other vocation Cons:Cannot attack from far away unless you wanna use a bow or spears(HIGHLY not recommended) also has the LEAST amount of mana out of all the vocations and has almost NO spells Cannot get magic level higher then 8 and is VERY DIFFICULT to get higher then 2 3 or 4
Paladins Pros: Can attack from far away due to its use of Bows and spears and other Ranged weapons Has a Decent amount of spells and can get magic level fairly high has a good amount of HP and mana can use the trees and other obstacles to its advantage Con.Go to the library and go UP the stairs and talk to the Oracle in the other room say Hi then Enter a town(the oracle will tell you what towns to choose from any will do) then tell the oracle what job you have chosen (this is irreversible so once you have chosen your job you can not change it think twice before making your choice) then when you're done say Yes then your off to the mainland as your new job buy some new armor and get out there and show the world who you are made of!

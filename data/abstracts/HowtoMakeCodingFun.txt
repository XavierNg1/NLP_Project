Remember nothing is as difficult as it seems.
Collect everything that you need to get started with what you want to learn.
Get started with basics of coding: print a message, declare variables, perform some mathematics manipulation, run some loops, apply comments, etc.
Follow the step by step procedure as prescribed in a book, white paper, article, research, etc.
Deface your mind to make it remember what you learn.
Practice and apply what you learned.

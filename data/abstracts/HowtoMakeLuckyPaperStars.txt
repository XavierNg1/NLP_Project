Cut a long, narrow strip of paper about 1 centimeter (0.4Â in) wide and as long as whatever page you are cutting.
Tie a simple knot (of the same kind that you would use to tie your shoes) at one end.
Fold the short end over, following the edges of the pentagon, so that it does not stick out.
Wrap the long end around and around the pentagon, following the edges and the folds.
Tuck in the loose end.
Pinch each corner or push in the edges to puff the star up.

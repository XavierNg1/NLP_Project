Never mount your trusty steed without the right safety gear.
Once you realize falling is inevitable, try to look for a soft patch of ground to land on.
As you begin to fall, try not to tense up.
Kick out of the stirrups.
Ideally, you should land on your feet, bending legs on immediately on contact.
Don't jump up as soon as you're out of the way.

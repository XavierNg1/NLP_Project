Most modern WiFi gateways employ Wireless 802.11 N technology.
When purchasing, look for a WiFi adapter that makes the connection by USB and at least supports 802.11 N for your operating system.
For the best possible throughput for your gateway consider a "dual band" adapter.
One great example is the TP-Link TL-WDN4200.
Upon unpacking your new USB wireless adapter you will see an installation CD.
Once the software is installed you will simply plug the adapter into an open USB port on your desktop.
Once plugged in you should see a list of available networks.
At this point your operating system should ask you for a network key.
Assuming you selected the correct network SSID and entered the proper WPA/WPA2 key from your ISP you should be able to open a browser window and confirm you are back online!

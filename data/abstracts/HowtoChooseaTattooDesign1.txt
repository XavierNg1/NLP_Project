Avoid making any rash decisions.
Slow down.
Consider where you want the tattoo.
Spend some time refining the design and choosing one that has meaning for you.
Draw your own representation of the design that you've come up with.
Find a tattoo artist or designer and ask them to make a custom design for you.
Try to get a printout of the final design.
Try a rehearsal run of the tattoo.
Think before you ink.

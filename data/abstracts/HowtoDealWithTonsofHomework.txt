Keep a homework agenda/notebook where you record all your homework.
Make sure you are not overdoing homework.
Start with your hardest homework and work your way down.
Save studying for the weekend, or if you have free time during your day or night.
Start as soon as you get home, not taking a break until you are done unless absolutely needed.
Use your time wisely.
Once you finish homework for a particular subject, reward yourself by taking a small break.
Start in school if possible, during study halls and free classes.
Understand that the sooner you do it the more you retain from class and the faster you get it done.

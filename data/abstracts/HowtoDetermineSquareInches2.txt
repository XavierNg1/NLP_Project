Find the area of a circle with the equation "Area = pi × r2.",
Find the area of a triangle with the equation "Area = 1/2 b × h." The area of a triangle in square inches is given by multiplying its base ("b") by its height ("h"), with both measurements in inches.
Find the area of a parallelogram with the equation "Area = b × h." Parallelograms are similar to rectangles, the only difference being that their corners don't necessarily meet at 90 degree angles.
Find the area of a trapezoid with the equation "1/2 × h × (B+b)."

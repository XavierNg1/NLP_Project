Get a live geranium or two to study up close.
Use 11" X 14" sheets of watercolor paper.Gather and array of watercolor brushes, #8 - #12 pointed, a ½” flat, a liner, and a white squirrel wash brush.
Set out a full palette of primary and secondary tube watercolor paints.
Get a water vessel.
Do an abstract painting.
Try doing a painting called, “Summery Geraniums.”  Painting on saturated paper much like painting on super-soaked paper.
Try the simple “Geraniums in Distressed Pots”  It employs a resist technique using wax crayons.
Put the viewer's focus away from the flowers.
Play with focus in “Flowers and Leaves In and Out of Focus”.
Keep it “Childish and Simple.” This is wet color applied to wet paper in places and wet color applied to dry paper in places.
Let a wet water spot create a flower.
Try showing many views of the same geranium.

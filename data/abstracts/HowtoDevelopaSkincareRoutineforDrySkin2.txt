At school morning break time, or at your coffee break, nip to the toilets and apply another thin layer of the moisturiser you used in the morning.
While you're in the toilets, take the time to apply a good lip balm or butter (The Body Shop do great ones!).
Also, buy a big bottle of water at this time.
At mid day, it's time for lunch.
Before you have to go back to work/school/jobs etc after lunch, once again, pop into the toilets again.
During the rest of the day, eat healthily, drink loads, and keep on top of your dry skin by moisturising all the time.

Check your tack every single time before you mount any horse.
Go to the horse's head and check to be sure the bit is sitting in the horse's mouth properly.
Check the noseband so it's not too tight nor too loose.
Check the throat latch to be sure it is not too loose or too tight.
Check the reins next to be sure they are fastened properly onto the bit and that the ends are tucked into their keepers as well.
Move onto the saddle next.
Review any leg wraps.
Check the martingale.
Get ready to ride!

Chemistry of oxygen containing organic heterocyclic compounds is a sub-discipline within the area of organic chemistry of heterocyclic compounds.
This area of organic chemistry is rarely taught as a course by its self at the university except in universities that have strong disciplines in organic chemistry such universities in Europe.
Sugars appear especially in the structures of DNA and RNA nucleotides in addition to its appearance in the molecule of ATP.
For these reasons there was an interest in the chemistry of sugar derivatives which are mostly present in a cyclic form that is the more thermodynamically stable form than the linear form.
When used in inorganic chemistry it has potential to react with certain metals such as with magnesium to for magnesium nitride.
As a rule oxygen containing organic compounds are less reactive chemically than the nitrogen containing organic compounds of the same type.
However, alkoxides can participate in chemical reactions as nucleophiles as well.
Oxygen mustards are not as reactive as the nitrogen mustards by virtue of the weak reactivity of the oxygen atom in neutral alcoholic materials.
Heterocyclic compounds that contain oxygen have potential uses as solvents for performing chemical reaction and also they have potential for use as sugars derivatives.
Other interesting heterocyclic compounds which contain oxygen are the crown ethers group of compounds.

Construct a bin for your compost.
Fill your bin with a balanced mixture (for best results):










Green stuff (high in nitrogen) to activate the heat process in your compost.
Layer or mix the different materials in your bin so that they come into contact with one another and so that you avoid any large clumps.
Turn your pile regularly, once every week or two.
Decide whether to add slow rotting items such as tough branches, twigs and hedge clippings; wood ash; wood shavings and wood pruning.
Know what not to compost.
Harvest your compost.

Chat with him.
If he replies, say "cool" or if it is a negative statement say "that's crappy, are you ok?,
Relax.
Laugh at his jokes.
Ask him about something he likes.
If he isn't online, send him a message asking about a current event going on in your area.
If he talks to you for hours, that is a good sign.
Talk to his friends.
If you ask him out.... never do it online.
Say something funny.
Be confident!

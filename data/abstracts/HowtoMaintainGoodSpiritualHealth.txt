Have a good relationship with yourself.
Pray and talk to the Lord or whoever you worship.
Read a lot.
Meditate!,
Deep breathing sessions.
Listen to your inner voice and follow your gut.
Laugh a lot and sing aloud to your favorite song.
Don't take anything for granted.
Do something for someone else everyday.
Watch or read something uplifting.

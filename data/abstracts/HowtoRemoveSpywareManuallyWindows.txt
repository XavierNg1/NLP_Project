Try backing up the drive that is infected to a folder on the clean part of the computer, only if you have enough space for that.

Once again, use your best judgment and the methods described earlier for differentiating good from bad.
If you're using an external hard drive enclosure, use "Safely Remove Hardware" to remove it from your PC, turn it off, and remove the (hopefully, by now) cleaned drive.
Reinstall the cleaned drive in its own case and power on your cleaned PC.
If your PC boots, you should immediately run the anti-spyware programs in the "Cleaners" folder.
If you're certain that you have removed all malware, you may continue using your Windows install.

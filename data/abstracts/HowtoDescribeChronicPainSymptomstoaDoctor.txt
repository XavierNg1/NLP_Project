Before you go to your doctor, get a piece of paper and a pen.
Try to pinpoint exactly which part of your body is experiencing the symptom(s).
Think of adjectives or actions to describe exactly how the pain feels.
Remember and record when the pain or symptoms began and also how oftenÂ you have them.
Think about whether there was something in particular that triggered the symptoms.
Record it if there is something now that causes your symptoms to get worse.
Consider your medical history.
Finish by noting down your questions.
Keep track of your medical history and be ready to talk about it.
Be honest!,
Bring support if needed.

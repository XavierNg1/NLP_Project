Being productive requires targets and goals.
Avoid distractions.
Mess creates stress (I learned this from tennis icon Andre Agassi who said he wouldn’t let anyone touch his tennis bag because if it got disorganized, he’d get distracted).
Stop multi-tasking.
Write a Stop Doing List.
Be a contrarian.
Get up an hour earlier.Use Sunday evening for planning the week.
Stop procrastinating and just DO it!

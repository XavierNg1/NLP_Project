Get a journal, something that you enjoy writing with (colorful glitter pens, mechanical pencil-whatever) Make a special time to write everyday and make sure it is well lighted, quiet, and you can concentrate and be inspired.
When you are writing in general, ensure that you always try to keep the words flowing.
Read widely!,
Whenever you find out a very interesting, new word or an important English rule or even a new random fact, write it somewhere.
Write what makes you want to write more.
Observe your surroundings.
Inspiration is good, but the best writers, the masters of the craft, learn to control their 'muse' to some degree- try to do the same.

Think about how public you'd like the tattoo to be.
Some tattoos can be sort of "semi-private", by choosing an area that may or may not be naturally covered by clothing during daily activities.
The "peek a boo" placement is a fun way to flirt with a public tattoo.
You may want a strictly private tattoo for various reasons.

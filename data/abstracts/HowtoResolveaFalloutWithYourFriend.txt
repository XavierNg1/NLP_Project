Think carefully about the argument.
Decide how major the argument was.
If it's your fault, apologize - if you apologize nicely and they are a true friend they should accept it.
If an argument was your fault and they didn't accept your apology, keep trying.
In the meantime, start hanging around with some other friends - but when (if) you and your friend make friends again, don't just drop the person or people you were hanging out with.

When all the apologies are said, hug and make up - there's no point leaving tension between the two of you.
Make a promise to try not to argue as much - arguments between close friends cannot be avoided at most times, but they can be made not as worse and/or not as bad.
If you really and truly believe that the argument was their fault and it wasn't yours, but they think it is your fault for making it a big deal then try to sit down and have a conversation about your feelings with that person.
If they seem like they don't want anything to do with you, make sure you put it out there that you can survive, too.

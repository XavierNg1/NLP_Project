Try not to make the child feel concerned about stuttering.
Try not to consciously put the child in stressful social situations.
Listen patiently to the child without interrupting them.
Talk with the child about their stutter if they bring it up.
If your child goes to a speech therapist, talk with the therapist about when to gently correct and when not to.

Decide between hiring a firm or an individual.
Visit the official website of the software development firm and request for a quote.
Look for the firm that possesses maximum industry experience, and also ask for some samples.
Looking for an experienced firm, without actually understanding, is just useless.
Remember, one gets what one pays for, neither less, nor more.

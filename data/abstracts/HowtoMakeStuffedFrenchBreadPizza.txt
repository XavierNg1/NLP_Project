Cut your french bread in half, the short way.
Take your cooked meat, your soups that you have chosen and add them to your large saucepan.
Cook them in the pan until they have been mixed thoroughly and are warm.
Once heated enough, take the mixture and stuff the french bread with everything that you have mixed together.
Take the french bread and depending on the desired crust: bake it.
Remove from the oven and slice the bread into slices...about an inch or inch and a half thick.

,
Set the table with grated cheese, pizza sauce, chopped onions, pepperoncinis and whatever else your pizza loving heart desires.

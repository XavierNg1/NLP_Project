Determine what is needed.
If the person only needs ventilations, blow every 5 seconds.
If the person needs both treatments, blow 2 times (each breath for 2 seconds)while holding nose shut, then follow up the rib cage and find the top of the rib cage and place down two fingers and start your compressions.

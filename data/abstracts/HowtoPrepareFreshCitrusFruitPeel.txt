Choose a fruit that is free of pesticides, dyes, and wax (since you will be eating the outer peel).
Wash and dry the fruit thoroughly, whether it is organic or not.
Hold the zester in your hand, much like a vegetable peeler, while applying pressure to the fruit.
Adopt the same basic technique if using a microplane.
Try the old-fashioned method for grating zest.
Freeze the zest.
Alternatively, dry the zest.
Store the dried zest it in a sealed jar in a cool, dry place.

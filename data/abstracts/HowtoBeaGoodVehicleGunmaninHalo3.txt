Look behind the car at all times (if possible) when there are no enemies around - the driver will be able to see the front and you'll be able to cover the back, so between you, you'll have every area covered to spot enemies.
Keep shooting at all costs.
Aim right at enemies.
Stay with your car at all times.
Maintain contact with your driver.

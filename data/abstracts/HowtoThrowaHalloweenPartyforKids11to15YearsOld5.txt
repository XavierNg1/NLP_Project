Watch some scary movies, or just cool Halloween movies.
Play spooky Halloween games like:


Hide and seek (the unsuspecting kids run and hide while an adult dressed in normal clothes counts down from one hundred to zero.
Be creative.
Hang apples from a tree limb, and have an apple biting contest in which people try to bite them off and the winner gets to join the grown ups for the next big scaring ambush.
If having a sleepover, tell scary stories.
Play Wii games like Just Dance 2.

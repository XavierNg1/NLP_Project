Figure out the type of hair you have (b3, c2, etc.).
Once you have figured out your own hair type and texture, you need to search for products.
Be very careful with the products you use and how often you wash your hair.
Use a shampoo with no sulfate.
Use a high quality heat protectant so your hair doesn't get dried out or damaged.

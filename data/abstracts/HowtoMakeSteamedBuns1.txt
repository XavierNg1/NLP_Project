Place the azuki beans in a bowl, submerge in water, and allow it to sit overnight.
Strain the beans in the morning and put them in a pot.
Drain the remaining water, if any is left, and press the beans through a sieve into a bowl.
Put beans in a large, heavy pan, turn the heat to a medium or medium-low setting, and cook until the bean paste is thick, usually 20 or 30 minutes.
Add the sugar and pinch of salt, continuing to stir frequently and adjusting water if necessary.

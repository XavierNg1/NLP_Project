Go to a golf course or practice facility that has a practice green.
Place your ball one foot from the hole and at the low side of the hole, so that your first putt is uphill.
If you have a pre-putt routine (recommended), use it on each and every shot.
After putting out, go back to the original position one foot below the hole.
This is your second position, which is at one o'clock and two feet from the hole.
Your last position is from the six o'clock position and eighteen feet from the hole.
Keep track of how many putts you make.

Form a "bight," or U-shaped bend, in the middle of the rope.
Tuck the bight underneath the parallel ropes to form a loop.
Fold the bight back over and tuck it into the loop.
Use your fingers to adjust the ropes so that they all the sets of two ropes run parallel.
Holding onto the standing ropes, pull the bight down to tighten the knot.
Use a mid-rope overhand knot to provide a grip or prevent slipping.

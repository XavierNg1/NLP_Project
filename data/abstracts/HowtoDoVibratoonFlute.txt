Pick a note that is generally very easy to play, such as a b-flat or a D. Take a deep breath, and start your note.
Start a metronome on a moderate tempo in 4/4.
Keep increasing your beat until it sounds more like a full vibrato.
Practice until you can do a generally moderate vibrato with an even tone.
Integrate the vibrato into a piece of music.
Slowly increase your speed or move to faster/more complicated pieces.

Start by doing handstands on your trampoline.
Now keep doing handstands and falling over, but do them faster.
Once you are able to do that very well, try doing it by jumping in the air 3-8 times then doing a handstand.
Try doing that (number 3) without your handsÂ :).
Now we need to work on you landing it.
Now do a front flip.
Now if you can land on your feet but have to use your hands, then here is when you change that.
If you can land on your feet and not fall back, then now we work on making it look nicer.
Now you can do a beautiful front flip!

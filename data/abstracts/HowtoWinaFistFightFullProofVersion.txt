Never start the fight.
If it is a standoff between your attacker and you, do not hesitate to go on the offensive.
Leave the area.
Push away and start saying a random phrase.
While your hand is currently occupied by strangling the piss out of your opponent, take your weaker hand, and shove your thumb into their eyeballs.
This will completely incapacitate your first attacker, leaving you time to flee the scene.
Do not find a weapon, if you do not plan on using it violently and to severely injure your attacker.
It's a lot better to hurt the opponent if you need to defend yourself.
But one thing that works among all things is boxing out their ears.

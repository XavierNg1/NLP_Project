Wear gloves that have faux snow on them.
Wear all blue and white.
Wear a simple necklace with a sophisticated charm.
Act the part.
Make the snow appear to "come out of your hands".
While you're "making snow" always look as if you're truly enjoying yourself.
Try this out on your friends before doing it at a fancy dress or cosplay event.

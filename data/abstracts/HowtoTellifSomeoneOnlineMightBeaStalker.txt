Watch out for limited (often flattering) pictures of themselves; or occasionally very obviously fake pictures (professional, watermarked, inconsistent).
Look at their interaction very carefully.
Challenge as to why they add you.
Keep your guard up.
Notice if they are very heavy with the flattery.
Don't fall in with their attempts to meet you in person.

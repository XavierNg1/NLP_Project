Examine your own beliefs and feelings about money.
Evaluate and address your own spending habits.
Appraise your general work ethic.
Think about the values you want to instill in your child.
Look carefully at your work habits.
Invest in your childâ€™s education early on, making this a high priority as early as possible.
Encourage your child to do their best in everything they do, especially in school.
Be careful not to over-emphasize the value of accumulating money to your child, but rather what can be accomplished with it.
Teach your child about budgeting early on, by finding ways for them to earn and manage money.
Be very cautious in insisting that a child must work at a young age.
Encourage your teen to think about the future by sharing your financial plans with them.
Since starting and running a business is one way your child can become wealthy, guide them into starting a very small one, such as raising earthworms or even just selling candy.
If your child is good at something at a young age (like football, baseball, or electronics) ask them if they have fun doing that, and ask them how they got so good.

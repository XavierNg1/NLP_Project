First you need to glaze your bisque ware using RAKU Glaze.
Next, load the kiln and bring the temperature up to 1850 degrees.
You know your ware is ready to pull when it is glowing red and the glaze surface appears shiny and liquid.
While you're waiting for the glaze to mature, you need to prepare your reduction chambers.

,
Shred newspaper and fill some small metal cans.
Once the pieces are ready, you're going to need 3 people to do the Raku.
Person 1 opens the door while Person 2 takes the pieces out one at a time.
Wait a few minutes for the fires to smother and smoke the pieces.
THESE PIECES ARE STILL VERY VERY HOT!,
Take the pieces out with tongs and douse them in the bucket of water.
Done.

Before you canter from the walk, you should be able to canter from the trot.
Pick up a sitting trot around the arena, or in the field, if that's what you're more comfortable with, and trot for at least 5 paces.

,
Move your outside leg back behind the girth, but only far back enough that you feel your hip kind of "drop" and shift your inside leg like you're pushing your hip up to your elbow.
Squeeze your inside leg while pushing with your outside leg (a squeeze but with a SLIGHT forward motion) and encouraging with your seat.
Keep your reins tight, don't pull, though, and keep moving your seat in time to the horse's hooves.
Focus on the tempo and pace of your horse's canter, so you know what to expect from the walk.

,
Bring your horse down to a trot, then change directions.
Repeat the canter on the opposite lead.
Bring your horse down to a working walk.
Move your legs into "canter position".

,
Begin moving your seat as you do in the canter.
Repeat "canter position" with your legs in place, and be prepared for the canter.
It's okay if you don't canter on the first try.

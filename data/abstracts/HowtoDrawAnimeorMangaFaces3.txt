Draw a circle, with a line indicating the center of the face's plane, don`t the bottom hemisphere of your circle and coming down to a point at the chin.
Draw in the eye line - this should appear about halfway down the eyes.
Finish drawing the rest of the face.
Draw the hair.
Finally, ink your drawing, and color, if desired - traditionally this is done in watercolor and ink, or CG, experimenting with different media.

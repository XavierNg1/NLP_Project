Plan well before you go: make 2 copies of your important papers (passport, driver's license, credit cards).
Do plenty of research.
Go see your doctor and get your prescriptions renewed, including eyeglasses.
Agree 'check-in' times with friends and family - each day or each week.
Consider couch-surfing or other hospitality schemes.
Take it easy if you're in less than perfect health.
If you're in the mood for company, stay in a hostel - they're not just for 'youth' anymore.
Leave your age behind.

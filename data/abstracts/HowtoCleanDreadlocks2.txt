DO NOT mix together the baking soda and vinegar--baking soda is a base and vinegar is an acid, mixing the two causes a chemical reaction which neutralizes any cleansing power the two substances have on their own (which is a lot).
In a sink or wash basin, dissolve Â¾ cup of baking soda in a few inches of warm water.
Soak your dreadlocks for 5-10 minutes.
Rinse with cool water.
Have ready a large bottle of water and vinegar, mixed at a 3:1 ratio, enough to rinse over your scalp and lightly through your dreads.
Towel or air dry.

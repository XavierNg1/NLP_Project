Compare something you know for sure is a living thing to something you know is definitely not.
Consider that everyone who ever walked the earth was able to live because their parents didn't have an abortion.
Ask them to imagine for a minute that they are a fetus: Pretend you understand human speech and can hear your mother talking.
If they try to argue that even if abortion was illegal, we could not prevent women from having abortions, remind them the exact same argument could be used to stop anything from becoming illegal.
If they argue that a woman should be able to control her own body, explain that the fertilized egg is not her body, rather, it is, conceivably a separate human being.
If they argue that abortions are mostly done for health reasons or in case of rape, remind them that only 7 percent of women report that their abortion was due to a health reason or a possible health problem with the baby, and less than half a percent report that their abortion was because they became pregnant as a result of rape, which means the vast majority, 93 percent, of abortions in America are purely elective -- done on healthy women to end the lives of healthy children.

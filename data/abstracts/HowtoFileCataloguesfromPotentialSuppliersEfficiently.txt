Eliminate any catalogs that you don't need.
Work with the purchasing department and anybody who specifies material for purchase (engineering, management, etc.),Date the catalogs you plan to keep and make a note on them (perhaps inside the front cover) if you use them.Periodically clean out the collection, removing anything that has not been used in a long time and anything that is so out of date as to be incorrect.
Set aside a space for the rest.
Consolidate.
Choose a filing scheme, and go for simplicity.Tidy up the library occasionally, especially if several people are using it.
Get fresh copies of catalogs you use frequently.

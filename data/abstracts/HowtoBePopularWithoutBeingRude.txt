Choose a style that flatters your figure well, complements your body, and pleases you.
Stay updated in the fashion zone.
Use accessories.
Change your style gradually.
Focus on your grooming.
Washing your hair every single day will wear it out faster, and make it thin and oily!,
Beware of using too much shampoo and/or conditioner.
Your complexion is another important part of maintaining your hygiene.
Although makeup is not necessary, it does help attract people's attention to your pretty face.
Avoid chapped lips by frequently applying chapstick or lipgloss!,
Be a social butterfly.
Talk to your friends often, and make sure you have spoken with every friend at least once every day.
Vary your friendship groups.
Be friendly but neutral to all others.
Call or text people regularly.
Join clubs and activities that either occur during or after school.
Avoid bugging people when they're busy.
Don't be rude to the popular people in your school, or they'll definitely label you something lower than you want to be.
Stand up for yourself when needed, as this will give you a strong appearance and perhaps impress others.
Avoid sounding haughty, snobby, or proud.

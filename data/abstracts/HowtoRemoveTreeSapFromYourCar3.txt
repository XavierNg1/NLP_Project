Wash your car with soap and hot water.
Use a household product to remove the sap.There are a variety of products that you may have in your home already that can remove tree sap effectively.Be sure to use them sparingly and test them on a hidden area of your paint job before applying to any sap, as none of them are made specifically for the surface of a car.
Finish with a regular car wash and wax.

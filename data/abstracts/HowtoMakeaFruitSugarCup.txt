Firstly, buy some fruits from the market.
Open the packet of sugar and pour at least a quarter of the packet into a bowl.
Add at least 1 teaspoon of syrup to the mixture(sugar).
Then, put the bowl of sugar and syrup into the oven.
Use a blender and mix all the fruits together until they have all turned into juice.
When the timer of the oven has gone off, take the bowl of sugar out with a protective hand-wear and when it is starting to harden, quickly mold it into a shape of a pot.
Leave the sugar until it has turn into solid again.
When it has fully hardened, take the mixture of fruits from the fridge and pour it into the cups or pots.
Wait for one day as it takes time for the mixture to harden and then you may take it out.

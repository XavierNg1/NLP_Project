Make sure you have a C++ compiler or IDE that you are comfortable with and prefer using.
Launch your C++ compiler and began a new project.
After having your empty project set up.
Begin your code with #include <iostream> this is to allow you to use the cout(C-out) and cin(C-in) commands which are used to output and input from within the prompt.

,
Tell the program to use the "std" namespace by typing 'using namespace std;'.
Declare where your program codes by writing 'int main(){' and ending it with the closing brackets '}'.
Inside your 'int main() {' you will tell the program to output 'Hello World!',
After you have all that, you have to stop the program from automatically closing right after it opens.

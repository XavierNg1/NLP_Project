Choose a thinner steak if you are cooking on a stovetop.
Take the steak out of the fridge 20-30 minutes in advance.
Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper.
Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.
Add steaks to pan and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until browned.
Reduce the heat and cook to your desired doneness.
Let the steak stand for 10 minutes before cutting into it.

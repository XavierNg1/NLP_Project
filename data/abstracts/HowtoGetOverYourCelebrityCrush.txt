Face it.
Look at your admiration for this celebrity logically.
Distance yourself from your crush.
Spend a lot of time watching or listening or whatever at them.
Find a friend or special someone you enjoy spending time with.
You should know to back off if your celebrity crush is taken.
If you're cheering on a celebrity who is separating/divorcing from their significant other, know that this celebrity is probably feeling pain right now, and you shouldn't be reveling.

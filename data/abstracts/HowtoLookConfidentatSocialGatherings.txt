Stand up tall.
Take up space.
Look people in the eye.
Shake hands.
Move slowly.
Face people when you talk to them.
Believe you are capable.
Give yourself a pep talk.
Look at an invitation as a good thing.
Feel good about the way you look.
Calm down if you feel nervous.
Make your hands in the shape of a steeple.
Speak slowly and with confidence.
Say the other personâ€™s name.
Speak statements without a question inflection.
Stand up for what you believe in.
Talk to many different people.

Remember that a teen, especially one hell bent on getting a piercing or a tattoo, is either influenced by peers and/or popular idols, or is flaunting his/her rebellious attitude in the opinion of some.
Decide how to deal with whatever the source is.
Show them the negative side of getting tattoos.
Make them realize the long term consequences.
Warn them that body piercings aren't much safer.
Health issues aside, make teenagers see the financial aspects as well.
Don't hold back information of disfigurements caused by tattoos or piercings, for fear that the teen might find it too gory.
While discussing the dangers and implications involved, be sure that you don't sound too bossy or commanding.
Getting a tattoo or a piercing to show off the dark, aggressive side, however, is a bigger problem.
See that the whole point of getting body art is self-expression.

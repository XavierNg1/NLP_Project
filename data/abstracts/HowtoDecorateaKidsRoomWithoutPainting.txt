Hanging fabric from the walls - attached only at the top with some neat finishing nails - adds a splash of color to a room, and you can always take it down.
Add decorative knobs to the furniture.
Self-stick, removable, wallpaper borders, murals, and designs.
Remember to hang art and other decorations low enough for the child to appreciate... and yes, touch.

Don't wait for the baby to awaken, if forced to complete a diaper change during the night.
Stabilize the temperature in the room to the same temperature as what the baby is most comfortable to on the outside of their diaper.
Don't talk or interact in any way with the child.
Don't use the Ankle-Hold method.
Don't supply yourself with any external lighting near the baby's changing area.
Don't wait until your child's diaper is so super-soaked during the night, that you must change it during the night itself.
Use cloth diapers on your child as opposed to disposables.
Don't use store-brand disposable diapers, unless you are mandated to choose the disposable diaper route.
Don't allow the smell of the older dirty diapers or any other unnatural scent the baby might not be used to, penetrate through the air.
Provide them with distracting toys and objects (perhaps plush or ones that don't make noise), if they have awakened.

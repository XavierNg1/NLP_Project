Wash and style your curly hair.
Lay your cotton plopping cloth on a flat surface.
Bend over at the waist and position your hair on top of the cloth, near the edge closest to you.
Take the far edge of the cloth and drape it over the back of your head.








,
Grab the sections of the towel on either side of your head and twist them tightly away from your face in two "sausage rolls.",
Move up slowly from the bent over position.








,
Twist the sausage rolls to the back of your head near your neck and secure them.
Leave the plop on for as long as you like.
Remove the plop.
Rock those curls!

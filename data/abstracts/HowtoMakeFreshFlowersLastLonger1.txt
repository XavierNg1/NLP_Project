Place flowers in warm water as soon as possible.
Fill a plastic bucket, one-third to one-half full, with warm water.
Take the bucket of water into the garden with you.
Avoid overcrowding flowers.
Allow flowers to have a good drink for four to five hours, preferably overnight before arranging.
Use a flower preservative to destroy bacteria in the water.

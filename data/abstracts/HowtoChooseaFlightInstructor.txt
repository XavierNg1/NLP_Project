Airports usually have a Fixed Base Operator (FBO).
If no one has recommended a CFI, the school will assign one to you.
Some questions you might want to ask the CFI:


What is your schedule and general availability?,
After the first couple of flights you (and your CFI) will start to get a feel for how the training is going.
Flight schools are authorized by the FAA to operate under two sets of regulations known as FAR part 141, or part 61 (the FBO will tell you or ask) Many schools can offer you a choice.
If you are are with a part 141 school you will normally fly with one CFI.
The training under part 61 is less structured in some ways, but can be more suitable for some students.

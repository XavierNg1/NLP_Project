Locate the right kind of tree, depending on what's available in your local area.
Try to "visualize" a potential bow resting in the tree.
Cut down the right tree at its base and and remove the chosen section.
Split the section, if needed.
Seal the ends of your new bow staves.
Let the wood season.
Congratulations!

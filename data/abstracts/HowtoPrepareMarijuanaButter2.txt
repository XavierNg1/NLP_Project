Bring a 1/4 cup of water and 1 lb butter to a light simmer on medium heat.
Whisk in the cannabis and lower the heat to low.
Let the mixture simmer for anywhere from 2-5 hours, stirring every half hour and adding water as needed.
Line a fine-mesh strainer with a cheesecloth and place over a glass bowl.
Pour the liquid butter through the strainer into your glass bowl.
Fold the cheesecloth over and squeeze to remove any last butter.
Refrigerate the liquid butter, covered, for 3-5 hours, then scrape off the water on top.
Use cannabutter anywhere you might use regular butter.

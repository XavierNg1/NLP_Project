Go to the city.
Between the hours of 9:00am and 9:00pm, a skunk named Kicks can be found sitting on the steps of a boarded up building.
If you talk to him, he'll tell you that he can shine your shoes for 500 bells.
Once you choose, he'll whip out his rag, and shine them clean!,
Enjoy your new kicks!

Before you start snapping photos, consider what type of photograph you would want of the horse.
Once you've decided what area of the horse you want to focus on, turn on your camera.
Focus on a horse and start watching it.
If possible, get the horse to look at you and the camera.
If you are from a far distance, this is when the zoom option on your camera is your best friend.
Quickly take the photograph and make sure you have firmly pressed the button to do so; otherwise, you may think you got the photo when you really didn't!

Never go out alone on a cruise ship, especially when the place you are going to seems lonely or has few people.
Thwart being thrown off, if possible.
If you are thrown off or fall off, try to hang onto something.
Once you are in the water, scream as loud as you can.
Stay afloat.
Continue to scream even if someone on the ship sees and runs off to get help.
Unfortunately, the ship might go far away soon without anyone noticing.
If you can see shore, then swim towards it.
If you do happen to be rescued, seek medical attention immediately.
Be reasonable.

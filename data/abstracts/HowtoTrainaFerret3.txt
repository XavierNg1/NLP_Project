Spray Apple Bitter in the places your ferret does a little no-no on the carpet.
Get one or two ferret litter boxes, fill them with litter, and place in various places throughout the room or house.
Give your ferret a Ferretone treat every time he goes potty in the litter box and doesn't go near the Apple Bitter smell.

Put blankets in the corners of the sleeping quarters.
Do not spank, slap, or kick the ferret if it does not always go in the potty box.

Take it easy and don't make this any more serious than it needs to be.
Get close to him.
Give him time to realize that you're his friend.
Look forward to when you can admit that you like him and perhaps he'll like you back!,
If he likes you back, you both have the option of either keeping it a secret or telling another person.
If he doesn't like you back, be cool about it.

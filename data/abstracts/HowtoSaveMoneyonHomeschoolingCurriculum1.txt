Set a budget.Before you begin educating your child at home, you can estimate how much you think it will cost to do so.
Share classes.If you’re a member of a homeschooling network, collaborate with other parents to teach your children together in a small class.
Share learning materials with others.If you’re a member of a homeschooling network or organization in your area, you can propose sharing learning materials between you.
Make your own learning materials.Instead of buying a set of flashcards at a teacher’s store or book shop, make them yourself.
Reuse paper.If you have sheets of paper that have printing on only one side, use the other side for math problems or art activities.
Look for sales on school materials.During back-to-school sales during the Fall, check your local papers and advertisements.
Get a job where you can work from home.Homeschooling means that until your kids are teenagers, you or another adult will need to monitor them.
Consider part-time homeschooling.Homeschooled children are allowed to attend classes at a public school if they want to.

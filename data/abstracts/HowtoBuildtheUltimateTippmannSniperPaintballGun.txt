Purchase a decent barrel - There are a variety of lengths and materials that can drastically increase your accuracy.
Get a good paintball match to your barrel - All paintballs say they are .68 caliber, but all brands still aren't all exactly the same size.
Learn the importance of consistency - If your marker doesn't shoot an equal amount of air or CO2 each time, a good barrel hardly helps, you will not be able to shoot accurately.
Reduce friction within the marker -Tippmanns are one of the most popular markers for woodsball and many people "snipe" with them, but from the factory Tippmanns have paint residue in the receiver where the bolts move that causes friction.
Understand the value of a sight versus a scope.
Getting a remote kit, which is a line that allows you to put your Co2 Tank or Air Tank on your back, will allow you to significantly lighten your marker.
Understand that camouflage is very important Since the ideal range for a regular player is about like 50–60 feet (15.2–18.3 m),a sniper can be anywhere from 100 feet (30.5 m) to about 200 if you elevate your shot, and if you do it at a 40 degree arch, you'll get about 300 feet (91.4 m), but no guarantees.125 feet (0.0 m) is where you are sure to hit them with one shot,so you need to be able to conceal yourself, and that means your marker and you needs to be camouflaged.
Be sure to have a stock for stability.
Almost every paintball marker has a very similar effective range (even 200ft isn't that far, and you probably won't hit them from that range unless you practice with long-balling, where you elevate your paintball gun.),
You can also lower your a5's trigger pull by getting a mechanical pencil spring and swapping it with part #2 in the manual.
Have fun tinkering with the marker.
A bipod also helps if you like to crawl around on the field, or are set up in a bunker, or whatever you manage to find.

Be enthusiastic — if you are excited about camp, the campers will be too.
Be their friend —kids look up to their counselors, especially if there is less than a decade in age difference.
Go out of your way to keep them happy — doing something simple like trading chips with them at lunch can make a camper’s day.
Get to know each kid individually — camp cabins involve a mix of personalities and interests, and each one has different things they're willing to get excited about.
Encourage inclusiveness—kids can be mean, preteens in particular.
Create activities to build teamwork—games can be fun and enjoyable with any age group.
Require safety but don’t be overbearing — the campers’ safety should be your number one goal.
Be someone they can look up to—as previously stated, campers look up to their counselors as role models.
Have fun—summer camp (or any camp for that matter) should be fun.

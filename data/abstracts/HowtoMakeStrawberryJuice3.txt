Prepare your strawberries.
Put half of the chopped strawberries into a large bowl and cover with one cup of sugar.
After 24 hours, remove the bowl from the refrigerator and pour the mixture into a saucepan.
While the mixture is simmering, wash the large bowl used for marinating the strawberry and sugar mixture.
Once the mixture finishes simmering, carefully pour it through sieve to make sure it doesn’t splash or burn you.
Pour the strawberry syrup into a sterilized glass bottle.
To make strawberry juice using the syrup, mix ¼- cup of the syrup with one cup of water.

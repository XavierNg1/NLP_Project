Have a good idea of what your program will do.
If you already know another programming language just start learning the syntax and looking up equivalents to various commands.
Learn how to compile and run a basic program, this will be your first program, typically it will just print "Hello World" to the screen and exit.Learn about variable types (INTEGER, REAL, CHARACTER, LOGICAL)

,
Learn about the concept of variables, arrays, functions, and subroutines.
Learn conditional statements, such as the "IF" and "SELECT CASE" statements.
Learn loops and the "EXIT" and "CYCLE" statements.

,
Learn about SUBROUTINES and FUNCTIONS.

,Learn Recursion (F90 and later) and other advanced topics

,
Read or look up some books on Scientific Programming.

A simple "Hello World" Code:





Note: you have to space each line over 7 spaces
C HELLO.F -- HELLO WORLD PROGRAM
C PUBLIC DOMAIN
PROGRAM HELLO
WRITE(*,*) 'Hello World'
END PROGRAM

Write(*,*) means "write some unformatted text to standard output"
Why the spaces?,
Remember that Fortran 90 introduced the "Free Form" source code, allowing code to be written without the spaces and without the 72 character limit.
Compile the two fortran files:

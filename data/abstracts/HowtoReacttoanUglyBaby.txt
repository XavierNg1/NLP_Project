Before visiting anyone with a new baby, prepare yourself for the worst.
Preview photos from Facebook or the baby announcement before meeting the child.
Time your visit thoughtfully.
Think of three positive qualities you could say about the infant.
Think of indirect compliments that can be said with a genuine underpinning.
Focus on the parents.
Keep comments about the baby short and sweet.
Keep quiet after your compliment or simple praise comments.

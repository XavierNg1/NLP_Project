Get yourself a little bit familiar with HTML and web design in general.
Consider who your website is for.
Open your graphic editing program (this example uses Paint Shop Pro but there is also GimPhoto).
Open up your web editor (in this example we use Front Page but there is also Kompozer and Sea Monkey Composer).
Get one of your "linked pages" started.
Go back to your frame set.
Create the rest of your pages, and link them up the same way!,
Publish the page.

Take the speed-chess clock to work and place it somewhere you will be able to observe it throughout the working day.
Wind each clock up (if it is a mechanical clock that is not powered by the chemical battery, but instead by some sort of mechanical store of energy such as a coiled spring) so you know it will not slow down and give an inaccurate measurement of time, which in turn would skew your results.

The speed chess clock has two clock faces.

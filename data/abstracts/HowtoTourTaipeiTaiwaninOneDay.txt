Get up bright and early, preferably 6:30 to 7 A.M. For a nice nutritious breakfast, you may want to consider eating at a streetside breakfast stall.
Get to Mao Kong Gondola.
After you find yourself done with the gondola and Maokong Station, take it back down to the Taipei Metro Taipei Zoo Station.
Call a yellow taxicab (just as you would call in NY) and tell the taxi driver "wo yaow zwoh dao taibei chuh jhan.",
When you arrive at Taipei Che Zhan (which is actually translated into Taipei Main Station), head into the station.
Take the MRT, situated downstairs in B1 of the station, to Jiantan (which is north on the red line).
Get back to your accommodation after the night market shopping is done.

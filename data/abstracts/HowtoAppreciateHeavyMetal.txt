Make some slight changes to the music you like, unless you are already pretty open.
Try listening to progressive heavy metal that doesn't exclusively use the death growl as vocals, if you are into very flexible styles of music.
Listen to some alternate forms of music, to get you into the groove, if you are into Beethoven and Mozart.
Begin listening to groups with harder and more harsh vocals, if you are into Suffocation and Vile, this is definitely the best place to be in.
Listen to music closer to your original genre that is faster.
Listen to hard rock music.
Listen to in-game and whatnot rock radios, because they plan often metal songs that seem not to be it.
Listen to melodic metal songs.
Have patience and take your time.

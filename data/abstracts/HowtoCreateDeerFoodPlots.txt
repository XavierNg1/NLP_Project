Choose an area with suitable soil but do not remove any small trees or plants.
Kill the weeds by spraying them with Roundup or other herbicides in the spring when they reach 8" inches tall.
Around early to mid-August rake off the dead weeds and brush and apply the fertilizers recommended from your soil test results.
On the same day in early to mid-August as you did the previous step, apply your seeds with the hand-held seed spreader.
Hang your tree stand, create shooting lanes, and make sure you do not set foot in your food plots until hunting season.

Lighten up your face to counter heavy frames.
Avoid heavy eyebrow makeup if you wear thick frames, but consider filling your eyebrows in to accentuate thin frames.
Consider wearing eyeliner to make your eyes stand out.
Wear bright lipstick to balance your face, but not if you're wearing heavy makeup.

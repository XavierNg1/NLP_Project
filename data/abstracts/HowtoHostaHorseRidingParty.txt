Consider which party approach you'll take.
If you want to hold the party at a horse riding place, you'll need to find one that can handle both the party preparations and the riding.
If you want to hold the party at your own home and take the girls to the event, think about the travel arrangements.
If holding the party in your own place, decide which of your horses are safe for different riding capabilities.
Get permission from all parents for their children to ride horses.
Decide when and how the guests will ride the horses.
Consider the need for horse riding hats.
Make or purchase invitations.
Add all of the needed details to the invitation.
Mail out or send the invitations well before the party.
Prepare the decorations.
Choose some games.
Make food for the party.
If the party is to finish with a sleepover, choose horse related movies for the movie part of the night.
Have a program of events and times so that you stay within the time allowed for everything.
When the guests are horse riding, keep an eye on everyone.
Follow the horse riding with a quiet activity or food.
Hand out goodie bags at the end of the party.

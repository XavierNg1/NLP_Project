Get denied!,
New or transfer students: If you apply to UMD as an engineering major and you meet the requirements for new or transfer students to get into UMD but you don’t meet the requirements for the Engineering LEP, you’ll get a nice acceptance letter.
Current UMD students: After you become a Maryland student you can only apply to the Engineering LEP one (more) time.
Apply: Submit an online application to the Clark School.
Appeal!,
Consider the following tactics for putting your appeal together:

,
Write a simple, clear letter in business format (to be emailed).
If you have any related work experience, draft a current resume with the Clark School of Engineering in mind.

,
Schedule an appointment at the UMD Writing Center and have someone there proofread your letter and resume.

,
Gather two or three letters of recommendation from professors, employers, or graduate students.
Compile your documents and submit them exactly as instructed by the denial email you received.
Be persistent: If enough effort is made on your behalf by other students and faculty to persuade the Associate Dean to let you in, they just might get fed up and give you a shot.

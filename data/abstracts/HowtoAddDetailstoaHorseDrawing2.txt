MANES: If you decide your horse is depicted as running, think of a mane position that goes with its body, or else you could have a running horse with a straight 'down the neck' mane when it should have a 'scattered' mane(the mane would be flowing backwards and straight up in the air.If the horse is standing draw its mane straight down the neck.
TAILS: A Running horses' tail will fly out behind the horse, but if the horse looks Arabian draw the tail held up high(like a flag).
If your drawing is a pony make sure to add layers of pencil streaks to make the mane look thick, draw the mane at a medium length.A draft horse usually has a short mane with with not as much hair layers.
Remember when drawing manes and tails, just go with what look suits best with the horses action.

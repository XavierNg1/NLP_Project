Talk to your college's Housing Department about the residence hall in advance.
Read reviews for your dorm at 5caps.com.
If the address is provided write to your new roommate, and see if they are willing to share large items (you won't need two stereos, or two TV sets.),
Let your roommate in on any health problems you have, and what they need to do in the event of a problem (like a seizure or low blood sugar), or just warn them that when you are stressed you get the raging diarrhea.
Don't try to move everything.
Consider what kind of things you will need.
Make a list of all the things that you will need.
Consider shipping some of your items up to campus before you get there, if you don't have enough space for one trip.
Buy a small carrier for your bathroom gear.
Get a small locked box for private papers, money, your journal...it's nice to have security, even if you have the nicest roommate ever.

,
Bring your own pillows and favorite blankets.
Make sure you have a month or two of refills left on any prescriptions.
Ask about parking for loading and unloading.
Make sure that you have checked and double-checked what to do on arrival.
Finished.

Fake a cold or flu.
Consider a migraine.Headaches do not cause the kind of noticeable symptoms that a cold or flu would, so you won’t have to do a lot of elaborate set up or change your appearance much for this one.
Claim a case of diarrhea.This deception depends on planting the right mental imagery rather than faking visible symptoms.
Go with irritable bowel syndrome to pave the way for future days off.This won't work on parents, but it's effective on teachers and bosses.
Mention that you’ve felt lightheaded all day.On the evening before your day off from school, casually mention to your parents that you feel dizzy.
Pick at your lunch/dinner and eat very little.When you sit down to dinner with your parents the night before, take very small bites and push the food around on your plate a lot.
Ask family members/coworkers if they feel cold.
Use makeup to look pale and exhausted.
Go to bed earlier than usual.The night before school, be sure to yawn a lot, appear exhausted, and mention that you’re going to try to get some extra rest.
Be consistent.
Wake up early to prepare your makeup and props.
Sprint to the bathroom with a hand over your mouth.
Pretend to be upset when discussing if you should stay home.
Keep the act up as you "recover."

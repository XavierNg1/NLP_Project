Pick a location for your decking.
Lets say your decking is going to be in the middle of your back garden, freestanding with no handrail or steps.
Check that the ground is level or close to level.
Clear the area you will be covering and lay down landscaping cloth or a weed barrier.
Build your subframe, Cut 2 lengths of 6x2 at 12 feet (3.7Â m).
Once all your cutting is complete the frame can be nailed or screwed together.
Fix your deck to its supports with brackets, braces or stakes and recheck that its slightly off level to the side.
Lay your decking.
Once all the boards are screwed down you can run a circular saw down the two sides to leave a uniform overhang of 15-30mm all round.
Oil and use it.

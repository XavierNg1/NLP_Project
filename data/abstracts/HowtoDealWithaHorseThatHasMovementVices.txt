Investigate to find the cause because each horse is different.
Once you have found the cause (or thought you have), try gradually giving the horse more pasture and/or herd time.
If the horse continues his/her abnormal behaviour, it may have turned into a habit.
Watch the horse carefully.
Continue to gradually increase the outdoor activity and herd-time for another six weeks, if the abnormal behavior is still present.
Speak with the barn/stable staff and/or all of the horse's handlers (and riders, if any) about their reactions to the horse's vices.
Get the horse's feet and legs checked regularly for abnormal wear and tear caused by the stereotype behaviour.

Be patient.

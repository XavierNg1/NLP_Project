Make your third job advancement after you reach level 60.
Training at Jesters is a popular place to train because of the quick spawn and good experience (around 1350 experience per jester).
At level 100-110, train at MP3 (Mysterious Path 3).
If you have no access to any of those spots, train at the pirates in Herb Town.
The Herb Town and Magatia Party quests are also a great place to train.

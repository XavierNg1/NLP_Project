Prepare for the introduction.
Go slow.
Alternate the rooms you keep the animals in.
Let the cat and dog smell each other under the door dividing them.This will help them associate the new smells they are smelling with a specific animal, even if they can't actually see it.
Wait to introduce your cat and dog until the cat seems relaxed and ready.If the cat is frightened and runs and hides whenever the dog gets near the door to their room, you need to give the cat more time.
Hold your cat in your arms until it is calm and relaxed.
Show your pets equal amounts of love as you introduce them to each other.
Separate your pets once again.
Continue to have your dog and cat interact until they are relaxed in each other's presence.
Separate your pets when you are not home or with them.
Redirect negative behaviors that your dog directs at your cat.
Reward and praise your dog for good behavior around the cat.
Provide your cat with a place where it can always get out of reach of your dog.
Have realistic expectations.

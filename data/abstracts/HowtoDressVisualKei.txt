Find a store that sells Visual Kei clothing.
Dark clothing is always in fashion!,
Plaid, stripes, lace, webbed patterns and skull motifs are very popular.
Wear your clothes loose enough to move around comfortably in.
Don't be afraid to mix and match different styles!,
Your clothes might be the outfit, but it's definitely your accessories that make it.
Any shoes that aren't too casual or pretty will go with your outfit!,
Dyed hair is always great!,
Makeup isn't necessary but it's still one of the biggest parts of the style.
It's very rare to see a Visual Kei musician without any piercings.
This is the most important thing to remember.
It doesn't matter what people think of you.
Have fun!

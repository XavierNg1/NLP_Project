Read the manual.
If the device is "on" turn it "off.",
Fold your rag into a small roughly two or three square inch pad.
Wipe it on in a circular motion paying special attention to heavy concentrations of whatever it is you might be trying to remove.
Change the angle of the light and your focus on the screen to be sure all of the dirt and any streaks are polished out.
Finished.

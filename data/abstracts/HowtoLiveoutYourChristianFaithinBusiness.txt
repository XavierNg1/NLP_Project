Remember that having a job is a blessing from God.
Treat others with respect.
Remember the big picture: while it may seem like those who cheat or lie get ahead, in the long run, that often catches up with them.
Get clear on your core beliefs.
Jesus came to serve, and his followers imitate him.
Pray.

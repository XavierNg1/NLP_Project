First you must determine whether or not you have the Holy Spirit installed in your heart.
Be baptized and begin to submit yourself to Him, for if you do not you break your connection with the Spirit and lose the ability to hear Him.
Begin your time with the Bible with a prayer… it might go something like this; “Father God, I ask you now to come and teach me by your Holy Spirit.
Begin to read the Bible, choosing a time when you will not be interrupted.
Think or meditate upon what you have read as you drive, wash dishes; just go about your day.
Respond to Him as you come to know and understand His Word and, thereby, Him!,
Have faith that the Holy Spirit is teaching you; knowing that He is the Teacher that Jesus selected for you to begin with!

After you change into your gym clothes, NEVER get out of the locker room first.
If you have warm ups, wait until the more fit kids get done, then go a few seconds after.
Only do the warm ups when the teacher is looking that way.
If you can, pick sports where you can stand there and look like you're doing something.
If you're playing baseball or something where you will be standing in line to wait for your turn to bat or what not, use politeness to your advantage.

Clean your snowboard.
Hold the hot iron above the base of your snowboard and press the wax into it.
Drip the wax evenly across your board.
Apply the iron directly to the snowboard base and spread the wax evenly across the board.
Once you've spread a thin layer evenly over the base, allow the wax to cool for 30 minutes.
After the wax is dry, use a scraper to remove excess wax and smooth any bumps.
Use a medium-hard nylon bristle brush to create structure.
Use a cloth to polish the base.

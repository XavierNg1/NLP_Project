Create a new document.
Create a circle by using the ellipse tool.
Make a line by clicking on the line tool.
Rotate the line at 25 degree angle.
Once you've rotated and copied the line, you'll need to rotate and copy it again five more times.
Now go to window > pathfinder for your pathfinders window.
Ungroup the triangular pie pieces.
Now that the shapes are ungrouped, you can click the individual triangles and add color to the triangleâ€™s fills.
After you've added color to the triangles fills, you can group them all together again.
After grouping the triangles all together, take out their black stroke for a cleaner finish on your artwork.

Set up the playing field.
Pick teams.
Once you have a leader for the plants, they will take the leafy branch, and stand on the cinder-block.
Arm the teams.
Start the game.
The zombies start by doing a "zombie walk" slowly across the yard.
The plant leader yells at the plants, (addressing them by number) telling them what to do.
If a zombie gets hit, they stop, and go back to where they began.
If a plant misses while throwing, they have to run and manually get the ball.
If a zombie wishes, they may knock the ball away with their bat or tennis racket.
If a zombie passes the border, the plant leader chooses a plant to get out of the game, and the zombie gets to start again, even if they only have one life.

,If one team loses all their members, (the zombies cross the line a number of times equal to the number of plants, or all the zombies get hit twice) the side that still has members wins.

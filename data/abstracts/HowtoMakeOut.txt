Make eye contact.
Move slowly and gently.
Keep your hands busy.
Tease your kissing partner.
Remember to come up for air.
Talk a little.
Keep things light.
Kiss your special someone's face and neck.
Stroke your kissing partner's hair.
Give a few gentle bites.
Whisper in your kissing partner's ear.
Keep mixing things up.
Let your kissing partner know when you need a break.
Let your kissing partner know how much you liked it.
Leave your kissing partner wanting more.

Try not to act foolish or weak, they will take more advantage of you than they already are.
Cooperate.
Try to identify which hand they are using to hold the gun.
Wait for the gun to be at your back.
Once you've identified which hand the gun is in and when the gun is at your back, turn to the same side the gun is.
Once the gun is out of the way, do whatever you can to fight them, bite them, claw them, punch them, but be cautious not to have the gun pointing at you.
If the gun is out their hands, move it somewhere they can't have easy reach.
If you can hold them down, call emergency services for police and keep them down unless you want to attempt to run away.

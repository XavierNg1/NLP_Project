Know what to expect.
Ask your teacher how the test will be administered, and take time to check the syllabus.

,
Spend a lot of time in your lesson and on your own time preparing for the exam.

,
Understand what you're playing and listening to.

,
Practice scales.
Do a practice exam beforehand with your teacher.

,
Do not leave aural and sight reading practice for the last two weeks.
Practice everything correctly, because the way you practice it is the way you will play it.

,
Memorize the ledger lines and spaces of each clef and the notes they represent.
If you get time for a short practice run, look quickly at the key signature and clefs, and then play the piece without stopping if you make a mistake.
Do not try to show off by playing it quickly if you cannot do it.
You will most likely be given two lines to sight read.
Practice!,
Spend time just looking at the music and hearing its sound in your head.

,
If you're memorizing a piece, practice hands separately until they are comfortable, before playing with hands together.
If you have the option in the exam, most people like to play the scales and arpeggios before the pieces, to limber their fingers up.

,
If the option is given to you in the exam, spend time deciding which order to play the pieces in.
Quiz yourself on the key signatures of each scale.
Practice the scales hands apart, together, with your eyes closed, one hand staccato and one hand legato: mix it up so that you know the scales inside out.
In lower grade exams, you will probably be asked to clap to the beat, name the time signature, and distinguish differences between the same piece when played twice.
If you are asked for the metre of the piece, think where you clapped for the strong beat.
To work out whether the metre is simple or compound, think about each beat.
Understand simple time signatures.
Understand compound time signatures.
Note that some time signatures can be used for either simple or compound time.
Learn the terminology accurately.

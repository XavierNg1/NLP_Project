Place the chicken breasts into a plastic, zippered bag, then pound them flat with meat mallet.
Season both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat until it starts to smoke a little.If you aren't using a nonstick skillet, lightly coat the skillet with about 2 to 3 teaspoons of cooking oil.
Arrange the chicken in a single layer on the skillet.
Lower the heat to medium, then cook the chicken for 8 to 12 minutes, turning it occasionally using a spatula.
Serve the chicken, or use it in your recipe.

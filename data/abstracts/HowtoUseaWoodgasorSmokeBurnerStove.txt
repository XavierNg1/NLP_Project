Understand how the smoke-burner stove works based on the design of the combustion chamber (its dimensions, primary and secondary air holes, and either air pumped with a fan or using natural draft without a fan).
Smoke: There is a chance that your stove might sometimes generate too much smoke, for the following reasons


Chips of wood or shavings are wet.
Kitchen environment: Always use a well-ventilated kitchen or semi-ventilated or fully open areas.
Outdoors: shield the stove from the wind using a windscreen.

Fill correctly with your chosen fuel: There should be contiguity between pieces of fuel (no voids, but not packed too tightly -- there should be chance for flow of primary air).
Lighting the fuel: Use small pieces of wood shavings soaked (not too much) in any mild fire oil (kerosene / diesel / vegetable oil / etc.).
Multigrade fuel: If using multigrade fuel, sort/sieve it and could classify it into two grades for use.
If a pot skirt is available, use it.
Kill the fire, when the cooking is done, if the stove will be unattended, empty the remaining fuel and charcoal into a tub of water or into an air-tight fire and heat-proof container to prevent burns, smoke, and carbon monoxide poisoning.

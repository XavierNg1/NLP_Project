Begin from a perspective of study or research, not as a foreigner or outsider.
Try to understand the context of the differences, not just the differences themselves.

Look for the underlying cultural similarities, finding the basic human behavior underneath it all.
Know that you don't have to love all practices of a culture to accept people at large.

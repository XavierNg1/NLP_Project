Find your fishing weight.
Choose the size and type of weight designed for the type of fishing you're planning on doing.
Purchase fishing line.
Slide your weight onto the line through the opening in the top of the weight.
Place a piece of rubber band along the line just beneath where you want the weight to be.
Take the open end on the line and securely wrap it around the rubber band with approximately five loops.
Take the free end of the line and feed it down beside the rubber band and under your loops.
Use a pair of scissors to trim the end of the line extending from the knot, if needed.

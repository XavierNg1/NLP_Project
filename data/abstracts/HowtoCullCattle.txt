During the year you are going through with your cattle operation, keep track of how each and every cow, bull and calf does during that year.
When deemed necessary, separate those animals that are on your cull list into a separate pen or corral from the rest of the herd using calm herding practices.
Phone the auction barn and go load them up into a stock trailer.
Haul them to the auction.

,
Back up to the stockyard entrance where you can unload your culls, then go to the office and pick up your bill.
After you have picked up your cheque, take yourself, your truck and that empty trailer home and enjoy the rest of the day.

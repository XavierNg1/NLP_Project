Stay calm, and do not ever run.
Keep your distance, stepping sideways away and keeping your eyes on the bear.
Announce that you're human by speaking in a low, calm voice.
Make yourself as big as possible with hands, clothes, and high ground.
Give the bear an escape route, always.
Understand the bear's motivations.
If the bear seems to escalate and get aggressive, get aggressive in response.

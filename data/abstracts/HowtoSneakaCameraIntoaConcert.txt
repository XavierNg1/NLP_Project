Examine your camera.
Check its size.
Find a place to put your camera.
If your camera is strong and thin enough, put your camera in your shoe.
Wear an old jacket and carve a little seam in it(make sure it's on the inside of the coat so nobody sees it), the size of a camera will do it and tape it up or sew it up.
Once inside, if you get caught, do not make a fuss or a scene, your camera, film, memory card, and tickets may all be subject to confiscation.
Take a cinch bag and a hoodie, wrap you camera into your hoodie and put the hoodie in you bag.
Finished.

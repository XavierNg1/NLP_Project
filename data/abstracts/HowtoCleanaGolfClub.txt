Mix warm water and mild dish soap in a medium or large bucket.
Submerge your golf club heads in the warm water for several minutes.
Remove the clubheads after the allotted soaking time and begin scrubbing with a thick-bristle brush or a toothbrush.
Wash your clubs off thoroughly with cool water.
Dry the clubhead with a soft dry towel.
Put the club back in the bag.

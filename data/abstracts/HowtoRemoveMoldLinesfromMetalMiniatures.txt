Locate the mold line on the model or miniature.
Gather all the equipment you will need to complete the task, including a pair of model clippers, a metal file, a brush and a sheet or tray to catch any bits of falling metal you may drop.
Clip off any metal tags around the model or large chunks of metal overhang.
Hold the model in one hand and with the other, select a metal file and bring it to the mold line you wish to remove.
Gently run the metal file against the mold line, careful not to go too deep and damage the miniature.
Follow the mold line around the miniature, filing bits of it off as you go.
Brush off any loose bits of metal dust or pieces that are still on the model or your fingers into the tray or sheet you have set up - then throw this excess metal in the bin.

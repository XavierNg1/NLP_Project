Before you begin, wash the dog's furnishings: legs, beard, eyebrows, chest.
After bathing, put the dog up on the table and dry the dog with either a hairdryer or a blow dryer which is specifically for dogs.
After the dog is dry, put some 'Biogroom Pro White Powder - Harsh Coat' into the coat (the bits that are stripped).
Take up either your Mikki Stripping knife (red) or your Mars Stripping Knife - Medium and at an angle almost vertical leaning away from you (teeth pointing towards you).
Take up your Grooming stone.
For the tail, strip it back with the stripping knife.
For the top of the head, take up your Greyhound Metal Stripping Stone 6mm and pull out all of the bits that stick up.
Take a step back and look at the dog as a whole.

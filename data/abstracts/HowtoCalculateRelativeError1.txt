When given an expected value, subtract the value you got from the expected value to get the Absolute Error.
Alternatively, when measuring something, assume the absolute error to be the smallest unit of measurement at your disposal.
Always add the appropriate units.
Practice with several examples.
Understand what causes error, and how you can work to eliminate it.

Marathon: A Tetris player can't be called a Tetris player unless they've played Marathon at least once in their lifetime.
Sprint: Now that Marathon has been explained, all other game modes of Tetris are based off of this.
Survival: Survival is just like Marathon, in that you have to clear lines to get to the next level.
Ultra: This mode is also a fairly classic mode of Tetris, and back in the day, the only two modes available were this and, of course, Marathon.
Sprint 5-Player: This is going to be a mode that you will play a lot in the beginning, and then maybe leave later on.

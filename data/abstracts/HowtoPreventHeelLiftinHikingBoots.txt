Buy boots from a store with a flexible return policy.
Get the right size.
Break in your hiking boots.
Use a surgeon's knot to isolate the lacing tension in various parts of your shoes.
Use the heel lock technique to, well, lock your heel down.
Look for insoles that will help low-volume feet "fill out" the boot so that your heel doesn't lift.
Buy or make a tongue depressor.
Employ the tried and true blister prevention strategies:


Apply an anti-chafing substance to the areas that are prone to blisters before putting on your socks.
When you take breaks from hiking, take off your shoes and let your feet breathe.

Keep your feet shoulder-width apart.
Keep your shoulders back.
Get low.
Buzz your feet.
Keep your head up at all times.
Accelerate to the ball.
Shoot from your breakdown position.
Shoot 'n rip.
Drive into the tackle.
Watch the other player's hips.
Stay wrapped.
Keep your hands free of the face mask.
Don't leave your feet.
Worry about stripping the ball last.

Prepare Invitations: Without an invitation, friends and family will not know you are hosting a party.
Decide on a party theme: Children of each age group have a different inkling towards a favorite television or movie character.
Buy party supplies: This is the core ingredient and takes up the major time in planning stage.
Design the party menu: The birthday party checklist will be incomplete without the menu in hand.
Prepare decorations for the final party.
Enjoy the party!

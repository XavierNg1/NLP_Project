Keep a box of plain white chalk in your laundry cabinet at all times.
Consider keeping a piece of chalk in a plastic bag with you if you're an especially messy person.
Rub the stain with the white chalk the minute grease strikes.
Launder the material as soon as possible.
Wash. Set the washing machine to a warm to hot temperature (if possible) to fully remove the stain.

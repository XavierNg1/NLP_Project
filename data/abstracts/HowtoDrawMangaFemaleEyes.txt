Take a piece of paper.
Draw a circle.
Draw another circle inside the main shape in the corner where you want your light source to be coming from.
Draw an oval in the centre of the main shape for the pupil.
Starting at the top of the main circle, and avoiding the highlight and pupil, shade from dark to light, to the bottom of the eye.
Add additional highlights, if wanted.
Using a black outlining pen or a felt tip, outline the eye, leaving the shading without an outline.
Stand back and admire your work.

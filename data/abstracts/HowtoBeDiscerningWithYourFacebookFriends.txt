Think about the benefits of reducing the numbers of friends in your Facebook environment.
Value your time.
Reflect on what "friend" means to you.
Consider all the other things you'd rather be doing than pretending to like someone else's Facebook updates, photos, ideas, whatever.

Set aside an afternoon to go through your friends list the first time.
Decline friend requests like there is no tomorrow.

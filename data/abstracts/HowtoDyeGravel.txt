Get a wheelbarrow that does not leak and clean the bed very, very well.
Buy the color RIT dye you want from any grocery or super center type of place and mix it up in the wheelbarrow bed, but don't splash.
Add gravel to bed of wheelbarrow.
Use a cleaned shovel and remove gravel already dyed, draining liquid as you do by tipping shove against the side of the wheelbarrow as gravel is removed.

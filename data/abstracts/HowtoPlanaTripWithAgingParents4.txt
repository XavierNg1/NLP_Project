Be patient.Traveling with aging parents can be slow and difficult.
Stay positive.Vacations are meant to be relaxing and enjoyable.
Be helpful but not overbearing.Even when parents get older and need help, they often like to feel that they have some degree of independence.
Enjoy your time with your parents.

Wear your seat belt whenever you are driving.
Do not lean against the dashboard.
Ensure that the airbags are turned on, unless there is a rear-facing child seat fitted in the front passenger seat.
Do not lean against the sides of the car if there are side/curtain airbags.
Avoid placing heavy objects on the rear seats or parcel shelf.
If a pileup occurs, keep your seat belt on at first.
Exit the vehicle with caution once you are certain it is unlikely that there will be further collisions.
Do not smoke, and do not allow anyone else to smoke.
If possible, warn other road users.

The proper way to open a jump ring is to twist the wire until the required opening is achieved.
Do not pull it open.
Use two pairs of flat nose pliers.
Grasp the jump ring on opposite sides using the flat nose pliers.
Use a "twisting" motion only to open the jump ring.
You should now have the jump ring open.

Tickle him!,
Surprise attack him.
Bite him (gently).
Call him by a silly nickname.
Jump on his back when he isn't expecting it and yell, "Piggyback ride!",
React to a completely mundane statement with exaggerated awe.
When he's about to kiss you, close your lips firmly, scrunch up your eyes and shake your head.
Be random.

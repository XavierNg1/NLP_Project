Be true to yourself.
Whatever changes you need to make in your life, get on the road to making these changes.
Dress in a way that makes you feel confident.
Trust the law of attraction, but beware at the same time.
Trust your instincts, and be a patient hunter.
Don't let your guy friends touch you for more than greeting, parting and occasional hugs in public.
If a guy is interested in you, then make him prove it by engaging in whatever level of public activity and affection is appropriate for your culture.
Watch your posture, attitude and facial expressions.
Be well groomed.
Don't call a guy excessively, especially if you're not in a relationship with him.
Mind your manners.
Look at guys.

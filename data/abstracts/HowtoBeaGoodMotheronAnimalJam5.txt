Talk with your child about the responsibilities of having a pet.
Decide what type of animal you want as a pet.
Go to the Pillow Room.
Stand in the middle of the Pillow Room, where everyone can easily see your words.
Allow your child to walk around the room and visit the animals.
Once your child has made a choice, tell the animal that you adopt him or her.

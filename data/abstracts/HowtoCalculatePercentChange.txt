Find old and new values for a certain variable.
Subtract the old value from the new value.
Divide your answer by your old value.
Multiply your answer by 100 to get a percentage.
When dealing with variables with more than one change in value, find the percent change only for the two values you wish to compare.
Divide the new value by the old value and multiply by 100 to find the absolute relationship between the two values.
Generally, use absolute change when dealing with two percentages.

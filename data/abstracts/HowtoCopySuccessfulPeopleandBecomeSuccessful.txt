Surround yourself with successful people.
Watch, listen to, and learn from the successful so that you can recognize how successful people talk, think, and behave.
Emulate the habits of successful people so that you too get positive results.
Read the success stories of others, especially those that you admire who rose to the top from poorer or less successful beginnings.
Learn even from the failures of others.
Continue to learn, and never assume that you know everything.

Cut the stems of the peonies down to ground level in September.
Prepare your new planting area.
Dig around and under the plant cluster to remove as much of its extensive root base as possible.

,
Shake the plant gently to remove any loose soil.
Cut the plant cluster into smaller pieces using a sharp knife.
Dig a hole for the new plant that is slightly larger than the plant's root system.

,
Put the peony in the hole at a depth that places the buds 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) below ground level.
Fill the hole the rest of the way with soil.
Water the peonies well.
Mulch the area around and over the plant with 3 to 5 inches (7 to 12 cm) of straw or another organic mulch.
Remove the mulch in early spring before new growth begins.

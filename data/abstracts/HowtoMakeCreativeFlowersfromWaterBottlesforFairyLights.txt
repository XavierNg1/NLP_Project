Start off by gathering your bottles.
Now that the bottles are ready, start cutting!,
Bend each slit piece backwards so that they take on a petal like shape.
Using a paint kit or any color substitutes (nail polish does it just right as well), paint each petal to your liking, both above and below.Drill a hole in the corks of the "flowers", just slightly larger than the diameter of the fairy bulbs so that they fit perfectly into the corks without sliding out.
Finally, secure your flowers unto the fairy bulbs and put the switch on!

Place your metal of choice in a pouring crucible, then melt it inside a foundry.
Use a jeweler's centrifuge (Centrifugal Casting Machine) to pour the metal into the mold.
Allow the metal to cool for 5-10 minutes, then dunk it slowly in cold water.
Tap the mold gently with a hammer to break away any excess plaster and reveal the jewelry.

Put together a double boiler.
Add the coconut oil and beeswax (if desired) into the bowl.
Heat the coconut oil and beeswax over medium-high heat until they melt.
Remove the bowl from the saucepan, and stir in the vitamin E oil.
Stir in your flavor oil until the texture is smooth and the color is even.
Transfer the mixture into clean, empty lip balm containers.
Let the mixture cool down, then put it into the fridge for 1 to 2 hours.
Finished.

When booking your flights, schedule a connection time in LHR of at least 3 hours.
Don't try to reclaim baggage.
Hold onto your connecting boarding passes.
Upon deplaning in LHR, follow the purple signs marked "Flight Connections".
Upon arrival at Flight Connections, you will see a row of desks in front of you being manned by airport agents.
After this check is complete, your boarding pass will be returned to you, intact.
After clearing security, go downstairs one level to the gate area.
Around 50 minutes before your flight departs, a gate assignment will be posted on the departure boards.
Have a seat at your gate and wait for boarding instructions.

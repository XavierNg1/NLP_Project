Start the seeds in a rectangular flower pot and transplant the seedlings to your garden so you will have consistent spacing.
As the seed heads turn from green to rusty red, they reach maturity and begin drying.
Using a large container about sixteen inches across remove the grain from the seed heads by rolling them hard and vigorously between your palms over the container.
Winnow the grain.
Final process: To separate out the grain that still has the hull attached use a soil sieve with an appropriate mesh for the sorghum variety and size grain you have.

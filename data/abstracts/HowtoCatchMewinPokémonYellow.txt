Defeat your rival on Nugget Bridge.
DO NOT battle the trainer hiding in the grass to the left of the bridge, as he will be a key part of the glitch later.

,
Save the game, just in case!

,
Start to work your way up towards where the other trainers are, battling each trainer and saving after each battle until you reach the trainer who has nothing but a level 17 Slowpoke.

,
Do not fight him.
Find and capture an Abra (try looking in the grass just above the Day Care building).
Walk up Nugget Bridge and save when you reach the end.
Walk in front of where he is, far enough away so that he cannot see you, but will see you if you take one step towards Cerulean.
Next hit the down arrow and the start button at the same time.
Fight the trainer with the level 17 Slowpoke, being sure to have him walk at least one step towards you to battle or the game will freeze.

,
Defeat him, and teleport back to the Pok√©mon Center again.
Click the B button and a wild Mew will appear at level 7.

,
Make sure to bring some Poke Balls, and good luck!

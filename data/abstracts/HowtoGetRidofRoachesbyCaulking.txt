At home, put a tube of caulk in the caulking gun (see: Things You'll Need).

Dropped or acoustic ceilings are the hardest thing to fix if the acoustic tile has big holes in it (pencil eraser size, for example).
Next, do the plumbing.
If you have forced air heat, lift out the vent covers and caulk or foam around the opening.
The last thing we had to do was fill very small gaps between the hardwood floorboards.
Keep your eyes open.

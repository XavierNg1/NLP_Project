Everyone suffers heartbreak.
Respect their choice not to be with you anymore.
Write 4 lists; one of things you hated about them, one of things you could never agree on, one of reasons why it didn’t work out between you two/why it wasn’t meant to be, one of things you want from a partner that you didn't get from your ex.
Make yourself feel great.
Start reading books and/or watching a TV drama.

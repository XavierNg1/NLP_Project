Focus.
Go with the 'feeling'.
Close your eyes and say out loud, something like, "I declare that I want my perfect mate to come into my life within the next 30 days".
Open your eyes and let your declaration 'go' by saying something like "It's done.",
Spend a few minutes now saying "thank you" for the things you already have in your life.
Now go about your day.
Draw or cut out pictures of lovers, or scenes of joy and romance and put them where you will see them the minute you open your eyes every morning.
Believe and receive.

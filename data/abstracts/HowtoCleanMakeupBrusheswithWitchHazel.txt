Gather all your brushes in a clean, convenient area.
Wet your brushes with tap water, or if you have it handy, distilled water.
Prepare the witch hazel.
Squeeze the water from your preliminary washing out of your brush.
Leave the brushes for fifteen minutes.
After fifteen minutes, take the brushes and rinse them off again in tap/distilled water.
If this did not do the job, repeat the process.

,
Once your brushes are completely clean, or clean enough to your liking, lay them out on a piece of toilet or tissue paper overnight to dry.
Congrats!

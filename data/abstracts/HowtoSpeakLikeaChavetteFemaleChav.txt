Watch programs like The Only Way Is Essex and Educating Essex.
Start picking it up slowly.
Every time you are going to say 'isn't it', say 'Innit' and change 'was' for 'were'.
Try saying "was like", whenever you would have said, "said".
Never say, "here you are".
Never issue an invitation, to a meeting.
Add 'like,' 'well' and 'proper' into your sentences.
Don't go round shouting 'That were proper good innit bruv!',
Stop pronouncing 'h'.
Be casual!

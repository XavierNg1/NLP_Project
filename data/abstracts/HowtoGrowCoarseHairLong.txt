Wash and condition your hair as little as you can.
Using any heat products is not recommended.
At night you can either braid your hair or carefully wrap your head in a silk scarf.
Oil your hair with coconut oil or extra virgin olive oil.
Consider dyeing your hair with henna rather than with commercial dye.

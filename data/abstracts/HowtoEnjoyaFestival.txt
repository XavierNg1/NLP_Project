Try not to be too single-minded about where you stand or sit, part of the festival experience is being part of the crowd.
Bring bin liners.
Bring your own lunch packed in a cool-pack.
Take a roll-up camping pillow for snoozes, and a raincoat.
Make sure to have plenty of water on hand, especially for all that hollering along to the songs you're going to do that'll leave your throat parched!

Take a book, magazine or your iPod for those dull in-between moments when one band shifts and the next one is setting up.
Bring your camera if you want a record of your time there.
Get into the spirit of the event by dressing up, using makeup creatively or even just sporting a treasured pin celebrating your favorite band.

Don't be too rigid about what you have to see and do because there will be time clashes of things you want to see, and don't get upset if your friends want to do things that you don't.

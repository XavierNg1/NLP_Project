Find a t-shirt that that you don't mind cutting up, and turn it inside out.
Cut across the top of your shirt, just below the armpits.
Fold the cut edge down by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) and secure it with sewing pins.Make sure that you are pinning all the way around the top of the shirt; you should still be able to open the shirt, like a tube.
Sew along the folded edge, leaving a Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters) gap in the back.
Measure around your chest, just below the armpits, and cut some elastic according to that measurement.
Clip a safety pin to one end of the elastic, and use it to guide the through the top hem of your shirt.
Sew the two ends of the elastic together.
Wear your tube top.

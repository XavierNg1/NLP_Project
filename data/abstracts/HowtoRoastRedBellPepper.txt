First thing that you need to do is gut and clean the pepper.
When the pepper is clean, cut it into slices (preferably 2 finger widths).
If you want to do a traditional kind of roast, I suggest you place the peppers on a rack that is on top of a cookie pan.
If you are looking for something that holds the flavor and will keep the peppers moist, then this step is for you.
Finally, if you want more of a bursting sort of flavor then read this.
Finished.

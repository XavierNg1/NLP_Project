Start with a clean piece of fabric.
Try to work outside or in a well-ventilated area.
Stretch the fabric over an open-back frame and secure it with clips.
Purchase some linseed oil.
Start applying the linseed oil onto the fabric in a thick layer.
Wait 30 minutes before wiping any oil residue off with a clean rag.
Let the fabric dry for 24 hours, then repeat the process.Once the fabric has dried, get out your linseed oil again, and apply more of it to the fabric.
Consider painting your fabric using oil paint between layers of linseed oil.

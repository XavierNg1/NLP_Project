Dart your eyes around, as if you are looking for some escape.
If standing, shift your weight profusely or slide one foot across the floor back and forth.
If you're a nail biter then bite your nails, if not, just pretend to.
Stammer a little when you talk; sort of stumble over your words.
Try putting your hands behind your back and rocking your weight from your toes to your heels repeatedly.

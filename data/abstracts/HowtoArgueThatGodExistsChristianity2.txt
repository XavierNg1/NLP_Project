Advise people to look around and look at the world.
Show how these natural, interdependent systems point to God when you look at the little factories needed within the cell to build and run the single cell (or from other cells within an organism, and from nowhere else in nature).
Consider where did meaningful plans (purposeful instructions) for life to exist come from: within the "living" cells.
Realize that complexity does not matter, it's the interdependence of the materials and instructions (plans) to function for a specific system.

Pull the inner cords out of the paracord about a half inch (1.27cm) and cut them off.
Flare out (widen) the edges of the circle that you’ve made with the colored paracord covering.
Melt the other end of each color of paracord with the lighter.
Using the awl, poke a hole about a quarter inch (1.27cm) from the end of the opened circle of the paracord length in the first color.
Push the pointed end of one color of paracord through the hole you just made in the opposite color.
Attach the snaphook.
Measure the leash by beginning at the snaphook and measuring how long you’d like your leash to be (the example in this tutorial is measured to 4 feet/1.21 meters).
Begin the cobra weave at the point where you attached the handle core to the leash.
After you weave completely around the handle, begin weaving (knotting) down the length of the leash core.
Finish the leash by trimming the paracord down to about a half inch (1.27cm) from the end of the leash.

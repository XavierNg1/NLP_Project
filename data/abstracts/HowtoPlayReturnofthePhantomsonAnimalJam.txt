Go to the Adventures.
Take a friend.
The first thing you have to do is find all 3 corks and put them in the pipes.
Trap phantoms.
After you find all the corks, water the plants.
Next, go to the bunny burrow and get the key to unlock the gate.

Then, you unlock the gate and find 4 purple keys to free the 4 caged bunnies.
Congratulations!

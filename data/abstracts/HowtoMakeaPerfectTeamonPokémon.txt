To start off, you'll need a team of six to have the best advantage when battling.
To put your team through a test run, see if you can defeat the Gym Leaders, Elite Four, and the Champion with your trusty squad.
If you do need to change something about your team, you don't always have to replace the Pok√©mon.
However, if you do choose to replace a move, make sure you perform a dummy run to make sure it's effective enough against the trainer you had trouble with.
Once you've tackled the above challenges, it's time to take your game online or against a friend.
When training up your team, consider using Power Items like the Macho Belt, and don't be scared about using the Exp.

Before you do anything else, find out a little more about your crush.
Make sure your crush is aware of your existence.
Make yourself available.
Tweak your style to perk your crush's interest.
Take care of your hygiene.
Make sure you appear in several of the classes in your crush's schedule.
Start friendly, comfortable conversations with your crush, and ask nice questions about him that will help you get to know more about him.
Slowly start to sit at your crush's table.
At this point, if you've become good enough friends with your crush so that you're a part of his daily life and attention now, your crush should be naturally starting conversations with you instead of you doing all the starting.

Finished.

Alter your diet one to two weeks in advance.
Consume more vitamin K. Vitamin K thickens the blood and enhances its clotting abilities, so loading your diet with foods rich in this particular vitamin may help.
Stop drinking alcohol.
Keep yourself adequately hydrated.
Avoid salicylates.
Control your vitamin E. Vitamin E is another substance that interferes with the body's ability to absorb vitamin K, but the effects are usually less pronounced than they are with salicylates, so you don't need to avoid vitamin E completely.
Stay away from omega-3 fatty acids.
Limit your exercise routine.
Consult with your doctor before making any changes.
Take vitamin K supplements.
Don't take over-the-counter blood thinners.
Temporarily stop any prescription blood thinners.

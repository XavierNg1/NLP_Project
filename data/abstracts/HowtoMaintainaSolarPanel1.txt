Purchase a solar panels cleaning kit.
Mix the soap with water in a bucket.
Dip the brush into the soap and water mixture and gently rub it over the solar panels.
Wipe the solar panels with the wiper while the panels are still wet.
Hire a professional solar panel cleaner if there are some areas of the panels that you are unable to clean.

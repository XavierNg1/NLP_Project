Know the signs and symptoms of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
Have your vital signs tested.Depending upon the degree of bleeding, an upper GI bleed can, in some cases, be life-threatening.
Receive blood tests and assess for anemia.One of the key factors to assess in a GI bleed is the degree of blood loss.
Receive fluids or a blood transfusion, if needed.After determining your degree of blood loss (through a combination of clinical signs and a blood test for anemia), your doctor will offer you IV fluids and/or a blood transfusion if he or she determines that your blood volume is sufficiently low and needs to be replenished.
Ask your doctor for PPIs (proton pump inhibitors).
Opt for gastric lavage.Prior to receiving an endoscopy, it is sometimes helpful to receive a "gastric lavage.",
Receive an upper GI endoscopy.
Identify the cause of the bleeding.The most common cause of upper GI bleeding is peptic ulcers (ulcers in the stomach).
Have the source of the bleed treated endoscopically.When the upper GI endoscope is inserted to look for the source of the bleed, it can also be used to administer treatment at the site of bleeding once that location is found.
Stop any medications that may worsen the GI bleed.
Treat recurrent GI bleeds as needed.

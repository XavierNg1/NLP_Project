Sit your child down.
Find out what the child knows about death.
Explain what “dead” means in simple language.
Discuss your cultural beliefs.
Try to avoid euphemisms like “sleep” or “went away.” These euphemisms might confuse children, and cause them unnecessary fear.
Be honest and don’t hide your feelings.

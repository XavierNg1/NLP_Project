Make sure you have a clean set of wine-making supplies.
Wash and remove the stems from the 4-5 pounds of fresh strawberries.
Coarsely chop the strawberries with a knife.
Mash the berries to a pulp in a large, food-grade bucket.
Add enough water to cover the strawberries, plus two pounds of sugar, then stir.
Add a sterilizing tablet, pectin enzyme, tannins, and an acid blend if making professional-style strawberry wine.
Cover the top of the bucket with a clean towel and let it sit for 1-2 days.
After two days sitting, add a packet of wine yeast and 1 tsp of yeast nutrient.
Re-cover the mash with a towel and let the yeasted mixture sit for a week, stirring 3-4 times a day.
Siphon the liquid into your carboy, removing as much sediment and pulp as possible.
Cap the carboy with an airlock and wait until fermentation is complete.
Rack the wine one more time, moving to a clean carboy and sealing with an airlock.
Taste the wine, adding a bit of honey to sweeten it if need be.
Use a ratio of 2:1 when planning the weight of fruit and sugars.
Keeping the total level below 1 teaspoon per 20lbs of berries, use more wine tannin with fewer strawberries for a drier taste.
Use 1/16lb of Sodium Bisulfate for each 8lbs of strawberries.
Add an extra teaspoon of yeast nutrient for each 4lbs of berries, up to 5 teaspoons total.
Consider trying out a "wild yeast" version by ignoring all sterilizers entirely.
Add other fruits for new flavors without having to adjust the recipe.

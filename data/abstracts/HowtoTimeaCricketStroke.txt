Stay relaxed between balls.
Repeat a mantra or complete a ritual.
Step up to the crease and shift gears.
Stand on the balls of your feet.
Keep your eyes level.
Raise your bat.
Point your elbow at the bowler as he runs into bowl.
Watch the ball.
Begin the downswing of the bat.
Point your toes and lean into the ball as you hit it.
Uncoil your wrists.
Extend your arms.
Hit the ball.

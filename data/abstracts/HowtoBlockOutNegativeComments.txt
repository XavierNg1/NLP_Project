Always plan ahead.
Get a hard shell.
Get a good group of friends, and have a great personality.
Have good hygiene.
Don't cry a lot.
When somebody says something mean, pretend it's a nice comment.
When you're uncomfortable with people you're with and they're being negative, turn away and ignore them.
If you want people to be nice to you, be nice to them!,
Lastly, always be calm.

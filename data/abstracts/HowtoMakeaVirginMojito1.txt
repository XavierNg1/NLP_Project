Find a muddling tool.
Place the mint in the bottom of a thick, sturdy glass that won't break.
Press the muddler gently onto the mint leaves and twist several times.
Stop when you smell mint, or when the leaves begin to tear.The leaves should remain whole, crumpled and maybe with a few tears.
Crumple the leaves in your hands if you are absolutely opposed to muddling.

Buy a good book bag or tote.
Purchase supplies.
Make sure everything has a place and stays in it!,
Try setting up a schedule in the morning that will help you with staying organized.
Always have backup supplies!,
At home, set up a drawer or area in your room for extra school supplies.
Only buy the types of supplies you need.
Label everything, and label it correctly, so you know where everything is.
If you like to draw or make up stories in your free time or while waiting for the bus, keep an "extra folder" for all your papers.

,
If you have teachers that often give you big assignments, keep a spot in your notebook for keeping up with all the info and supplies for that project so it won't be mixed in with daily work.

,
Keep hole punch that goes in your binder so any papers your teacher hands you, you can put them in your binder (if you keep a binder).

,
Do not shove all papers into your backpack; this will make a mess and you will not be able to find anything you need!,
Make sure to pay attention.
If your school has lockers, consider buying a locker organizer.

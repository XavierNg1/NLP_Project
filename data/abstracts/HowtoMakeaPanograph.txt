Go out into the world and find something interesting to shoot.
Manually set the white balance, focus, f-stop, and shutter speed on your camera.
Point and shoot.
Make sure you cover every spot with at least one picture.
Unload your camera and, using Photoshop, resize your photographs (try width or height of 800 pixels).
Create a fairly large new RGB canvas to work on.
Set the opacity of each photo to about 50%.
When you're finished assembling the photos together, make final color, contrast, and levels adjustments.
To share your panography or post it online, just combine all the layers (Shift+Ctrl/Apple+E), and resize your image.

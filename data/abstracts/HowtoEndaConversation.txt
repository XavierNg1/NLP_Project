Briefly think about what got you into the conversation.
If you started the conversation, it's more important to be polite.
If they started the conversation, wait for a break in topics.
Do not say anything bad; just say, "I have to go.
If you are waiting for a gap in the conversation, and there doesn't seem to be one, wait for them to take a breath, and then quickly -- but politely -- explain that you have work to do, and that you'll catch them later.
Think about what kind of person you're talking to.
Try to not lose your cool UNLESS this person is being derogatory, talking about someone else behind their back, or is severely interrupting your life or work.

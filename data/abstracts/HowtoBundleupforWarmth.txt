Start with lots of layers.
Layer t-shirts and long-sleeve t-shirts, and top with a sweater or sweatshirt.
Put on some long-johns or tights under your pants.
Put on your snow pants.
Put on your scarf.
Wear a good winter coat; this is an invaluable investment.
Put on sturdy mittens or gloves.
Cover your feet with one or two pairs of thick wool or polyester-wool mix socks that can be pulled up to the calf of your leg.
And finally, a tip your mother has been telling you for years: A good hat really can make the difference between staying warm or shivering in the cold.
Now go take down your opponent in a snowball fight!

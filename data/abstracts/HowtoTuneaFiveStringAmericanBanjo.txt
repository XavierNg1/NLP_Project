Take a look at your banjo.
Notice that the string nearest to you does not run all the way up to the top of the fretboard with the rest, but has its tuning knob in the middle of the neck.
REMEMBER that string through the tuning process, because otherwise you will get confused and turn the wrong knob for the wrong string.
It's time to start tuning.
Look at the five strings at the bottom, and find the center string.
Follow the middle string to the top of the Banjo, and find its corresponding tuning knob.Use the same method to tune the adjacent, slightly thinner string to a B (below middle C)

,
The next and last string in that direction is thinner still; tune it to a D.

,
Go back to that first half-length string.
Finally, grab the adjacent string, (It's the final remaining string you haven't touched; the fattest one).
Strum a chord.

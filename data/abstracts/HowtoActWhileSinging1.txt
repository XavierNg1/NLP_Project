Master the song on it's own, first.
Consider how you would act out the words if you weren't singing.
Use the song and lyrics themselves to your advantage.
Use your body language to match the mood of the song and your character.
Use the song's "plot" to figure out your acting arc.
Focus on the song's key moments and transitions as an actor.
Make your acting decisions in advance instead of relying on improvisation.
React to the lines from the other actors as if they were spoken.
Face the audience, unless otherwise noted by the director.
Keep the acting simple to be effective.
Practice until the acting and singing feels automatic.

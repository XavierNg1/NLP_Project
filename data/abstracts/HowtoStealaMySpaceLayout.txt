Now, a separate window should appear as soon as you clicked "View Source".
Scroll down the page; it may be hard to read but if you get the hang of it you will soon be able to identify all the components of the large page of codes.

When looking for layout codes there is a 7/10 chance that the code is in the "About Me".
Copy the code starting where it says <style all the way to the end where it says </style>.
Finally paste the code into your "About Me" and look at your new "stolen" layout.

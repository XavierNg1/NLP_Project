Organize the team movements.
If you are currently engaging an enemy unit, there are a few safer options available:


Leapfrogging (one person providing cover fire while the other moves, this can be used to advance, fall back, and flank the enemy),
Run and gun (providing cover fire for yourself while moving, the inverse "gun and run" can also be used to move from cover; fire a few bursts then run like hell), and
Lastly crawling (you don't get far fast but in a prone position you are less likely to get hit if you are 50+ feet away and have shrubs for low cover, do not attempt this in close quarters and this should only be used if the enemy is a big fan of spray and pray, as they would likely shoot towards you, not at you).
Deal with combat situations.
Deal with the ambush and creating a superior firing position.

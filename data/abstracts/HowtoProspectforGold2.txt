Travel to your desired prospecting location and set up camp.
Fill your pan half to two-thirds full of soil, gravel, and small rocks from the stream channel.

Put the pan under water.
Hold the pan level under water with your hands on either side of it.
Tilt the pan forward, away from your body and down slightly, still holding it under water.
Repeat the previous steps until a layer of fine-grain dark material overlain by a small layer of light material remains at the bottom of the pan.

Remove the pan from the stream.
Drain out all water and let the black sand and gold dry.

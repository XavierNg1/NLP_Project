Talk to your healthcare providers and trusted sources.
Conduct targeted online searches for groups.
Identify promising groups and ask questions.
“Try before you buy.” No matter how much research you do and how many questions you ask beforehand, you never really know if an addiction support group is right for you until you give it a try.
Watch out for scams, quackery, or “gripe clubs.” No matter how much we all like to believe we could never fall for a scam, we all have at one time or another.
Evaluate the group continuously.
Don’t try to get by on support groups alone.
Get a professional diagnosis and treatment plan first.
Incorporate support groups into your ongoing treatment plan.

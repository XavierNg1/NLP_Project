Focus more on your bad eating habits and less on a strict diet.
Aim to eat until your feel full instead of losing a certain amount of weight.
Give yourself one cheat meal a week if you are on a new diet.
Notice if you are using your “cheat day” as an excuse to binge.
Reflect on whether you are just following a fad diet.

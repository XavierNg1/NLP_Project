Know approximately what your 'net' rate of travel will be, and consider that instead of the speed limit, or how quickly you can move from light to light.
Know where signals are 'coordinated'.
Learn that green is bad, and red is good.
Discover that red lights are the most forgiving and the most beneficial things to see a ways up ahead.
Get a 'feel' for where/when to start watching and predicting where your car should be when considering a traffic signal.
Watch not only at the current light, but the next one and occasionally even the one after (if not too dangerous to do so, like when you're stopped and have nothing better to do), where signals are spaced closely together.
Watch the pedestrian crossing signals.
Watch the intersection for cars waiting on the crossroad, or in a left-turn lane facing you.
Watch left turn signals for traffic traveling in your direction.
When attempting to make a left turn yourself, if there is other traffic waiting in the turn lane for a left turn light, you can occasionally time your arrival such that the left turn light has turned green, and traffic is moving.
Left turn signals can lead or lag the straight through green, especially along coordinated routes.

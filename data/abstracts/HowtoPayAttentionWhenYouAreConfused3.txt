Participate in the whole meeting or class activity, discussion, your small group, or paperwork/board work (go to the board and try the problem).
Be agreeable, working with the manager/teacher and contributing to discussions with coworkers/or fellow students who give solutions (putting solutions on the chalk-/or marker-board) -- helping sort out ideas or showing how the answer is/was found.
Get into the subject as if it belongs to you.
Be on time; stay up to date: do the homework in your area of expertise or in school... Get help to clarify ideas or technical matters if you need it.

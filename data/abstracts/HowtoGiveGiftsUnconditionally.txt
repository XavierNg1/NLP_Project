Find a gift that means something about the other person to you.
Let it be a surprise.
Think beyond stuff.
Think carefully about what the other person would not buy for themselves.
Let the recipient know gently and without great "hoo-ha" that your gift can be returned to a store, re-gifted, or donated if it doesn't make them feel comfortable or happy.
Avoid giving "useful" items that the whole household needs and will make use of.
Expect nothing in return.
Be considerate about presentation.

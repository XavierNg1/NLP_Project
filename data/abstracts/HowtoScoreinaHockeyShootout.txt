Start at center ice with the puck on the face-off dot.
Start skating to build up speed.
Any decent goalie will come fairly far out of the net to begin, then back in as you approach the net.
If the goalie is too far out and not backing up fast enough, then you want to deke.
Once you have made your decision keep skating and complete your deke and/or shot.

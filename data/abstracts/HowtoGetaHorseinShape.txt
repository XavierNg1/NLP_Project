After researching a good exercise program, write out a customized program for your horse a week at a time.
Trails are a great place to start.
Add extra weight with saddlebags full of water bottles or weights for a cardiovascular and leg muscle workout.

,
Arena work is important, too.
Extended periods of long-trot and canter will build cardiac endurance, and remember to give loosening walk breaks when your horse gets winded.

,
Always warm up and cool down before every ride, to prevent colic and pulled tendons.

,
If possible, ride every day.
Check your horseâ€™s feet often.
Feed high-quality hay and/or grass.
Play polocrosse.
Remember, always have fun with your horse, and make sure that he/she is having fun, too.

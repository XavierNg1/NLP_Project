Make enough fondant for the size or number of bows you wish to make.
Roll the fondant into a square piece.
Cut the rolled fondant into strips about 1 in" (2.5 cm) wide.
Brush some water on the ends of a strip.
Fold each strip into a loop, joining the two ends at an angle.
Repeat to make several loops.
Wrap a small piece around the center.
Lay additional strips on the cake for ribbons leading up to the bow before you attach the bow itself.
Place the bow on top of the trailing ends.

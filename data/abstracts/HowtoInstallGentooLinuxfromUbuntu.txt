Make sure that you have superuser privileges on your Ubuntu box; and an Internet connection - preferably a fast one.
You need to install chroot on Ubuntu.
Either repartition existing partitions, or create a new partition from free Hard Disk space.
Format the new partition(s) using a File System of your choice (for /home, /, /boot and /var it is preferable to use ext2, ext3 or reiser2).Create a new folder, /mnt/gentoo and one for each of the separate partitions that you created.
Mount your new partitions on here:

sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt/gentoo
sudo mount /dev/sda6 /mnt/gentoo/home




where here, sda5 and 6 are the partitions containing your prospective root and home directories respectively.



,
Check that your date is correct (type date).
Open a web browsing program of your choice, and navigate to here.Move it to the Gentoo folder mv stage3*.bz2* /mnt/gentoo.
Move yourself there (cd /mnt/gentoo) and check the tarball through md5: md5sum -c stage3*.md5.
Extract the tarball!,
You now have a few basic programs installed on the Gentoo partition; next, you need to install Portage: Gentoo's package management system which allows you to have complete control over what is on your system.
At this stage, you may want to set some compile flags.
Want to optimise your download?,
Before you immerse yourself in your new system, you need to make sure that you have a few vital settings copied over from Ubuntu as it is.
Now you can chroot!,
Congratulations!,
Next, you need to compile the most vital component of any operating system: its kernel.
Remember installing portage earlier?,For the sake of clarity, at this stage I'll assume that you want to install the latest kernel (2.6) rather than 2.4.
Now we must set our USE flags.
Every flag you want to add is simply a word.To choose your USE flags, check out the Gentoo USE Flags documentation to see what flags you might want to include.Once you have chosen what flags to use, navigate to /etc/make.conf and put in the flags you want.
Let's now set up your timezone.Now that we have our timezone set up, it is time to actually download our kernel sources and configure the kernel.Run (# emerge gentoo-sources) to download your kernel sources.
This next step can be tricky for first timers.
Run

cd /usr/src/linux
make menuconfig

,
This will bring up the kernel configuration menu.Select any network drivers you may need, such as ethernet drivers or wireless drivers (or both).Choose your processor type and family.
Once you've finished, type ( make && make modules_install) to start compiling the kernel and kernel modules.make -j2 && make modules_install,
Now we need to copy your kernel image to /boot.
Now let's configure your kernel modules.

Go and get your notebook/piece of paper and pen.
Open up a Microsoft Word document (or something similar) on your computer.
Staple it together.
If you don't have time to make the recipe book or don't have a printer you can buy one but a homemade one feels likeÂ you put more work into the kit.
Remember to check the word document for typos before printing!

Make sure you have done your homework.
Be ready to walk away.
Stroll onto the lot like a lost puppy.
Let the salesperson eventually steer you to the type of car you want.
Stroll away toward some other type of car and poke around a bit.
Let the salesperson take you inside, or let him open up that one so you can sit in it.
Expect to be given a price.
Keep being resistant.
Make your counteroffer.
Expect an agreement to your price.

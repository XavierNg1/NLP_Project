Use a special notebook as a journal of your life for planning and a record of life -- a history.
Write for your specific purpose as your own take on what is happening in any area of interest -- your commentary.
Dedicate a notebook/journal to this purpose only.
Check into keeping a private blog.
Beware; keep your private book or notebook journal at home: on your home desk, next to your computer, in your desk drawer at home.

,
Do not take your private information to school or work: the chance of its being seen or found and read by your co-workers, teacher or boss outweigh the benefits.

,
Carry a smaller notebook for temporary notes that could fit in your pocket or purse for convenience and privacy: It would only be some notes to use at home, and pages can be disposed of later.

,
Write about what happens at work or school, and at home and on the other side of the earth.
Record your ideas, goals, prayers and historical events of your life in your notebook and how each issue develops.
Keep up with each area's progress and failings, using common sense and look for the good things for all.

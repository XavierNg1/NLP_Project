Find a quiet space.
Root your feet to the ground.
Practice better breathing.
Be mindful of your breathing.
Imagine you are connected to the Earth.
Exert your energy downward.
Push your energy upward.
Feel your energy run from the roots to the branches.
Come back to stillness.
Connect to nature.
Relax while you create.
Practice Tai chi.
Keep a journal.

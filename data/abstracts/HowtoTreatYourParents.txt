Think about it.
Be communicative.
Remember that if you sacrifice one thing for them, they will sacrifice another million for you.
Take care of them, mentally and physically.
Write/text/email things to them every day, about how much you love them.
At your school, show them off and think how lucky you are to have two great parents.
Finally, just love them a little bit more every day!

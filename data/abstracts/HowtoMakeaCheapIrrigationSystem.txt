Plan some of your gardening activity to be close to and around the house.
Stop at some construction sites during your daily activities.
Clean out the pails with a stiff brush and a scraper.
Start washing all or some of your dishes by hand.
Water the garden just outside your kitchen doors or wherever it is located.
Continue this system as much as possible.

Consider setting a set budget.

Always check your fridge.

Think of ingredients that are both cheap and nutritious like: potatoes, tomatoes, pasta, multi-grain loaf of bread, eggs, beans, fruits, soup, fried rice, etc.

Think of cheap meal plans you could carry out with your ingredients.

Go generic whenever you can.

Look for the "Two for One" coupons.

Always ration your portions to a single serving.

Make sure you freeze any unused food.

If your city offers clean water from the tap, consider drinking it as it is usually a good alternative when compared to other drinks.

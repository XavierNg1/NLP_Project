Make a list.
Take care of business first.
Target the critical items and make sure you fill one or two of these each month or two.
Buy whatever else floats your boat the rest of the month.
Keep to this list every month.
Fight hard to get the best deals when you buy your one big thing each month.
Stay with it each month without fail.
Ditch the 'friends' who drag you down.

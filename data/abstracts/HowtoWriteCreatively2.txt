Write the story out linearly, as simply or complex as possible, to give yourself a template.
Know that great characters drive great stories, not the other way around.
Set goals and timers to keep yourself writing.
Think in terms of "scene" when writing, not the entire project.
Fight writer's block by just continuing to write.

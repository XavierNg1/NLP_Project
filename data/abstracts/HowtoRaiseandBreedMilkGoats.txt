Choose a breed.
First look for local goat dairies, or attend a local fair or 4-H show to talk to a knowledgeable goat owner.
Goats need a shelter as well as some open space outside to roam around in.
Be sure you have a secure location for them that will protect them from the elements.
Provide some type of bedding.
Now on to the breeding.
Consider renting a buck for your goat.
Be sure your doe is in standing heat.
Don't breed them too young.

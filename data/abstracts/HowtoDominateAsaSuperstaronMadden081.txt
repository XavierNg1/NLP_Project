Be a Half Back or Wide Receiver.
When making your attributes, take down the ones that don't immediately benefit you.
Upgrade the most important factors.
Keep your ego up.
Choose your team.
To make yourself starter, just edit the depth chart (either in-game or on your superstar's computer.),
If you are on defense, become a MLB or safety so you can see the field better.

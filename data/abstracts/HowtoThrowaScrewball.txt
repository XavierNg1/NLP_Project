Place your index and middle finger on the inside seam of the horseshoe, as you would with a curveball grip.
Wind up and start your throwing motion as you would throw a fastball.
When throwing the pitch, pronate your wrist in the opposite direction you would throwing a curveball.
Finish off the pitch by putting pressure on your pointer finger until you release the ball.
Throw the screwball sparingly.

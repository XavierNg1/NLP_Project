When at school, try to always have your top button done up, as it gives that classic indie look.
Grow your hair to a reasonable length, in some cases, very long hair looks quite indie-like.
If your school has a policy of wearing v-necked jumpers, then have the sleeves rolled up, and if you have a long sleeved shirt (which does look better) roll the sleeves up as well so that your shirt sleeves are scrunched up just below the rolled up sweater sleeve.
Have a good vocabulary and grammar, it may seem dorky, but it works well with the indie-type crowd.

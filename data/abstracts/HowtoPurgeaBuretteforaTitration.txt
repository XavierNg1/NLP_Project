Fill the burette with 5 mL of distilled water.
Tilt the burette horizontally so the water coats the sides of the burette.
Rotate the burette so the water rinses the entire burette.
Tip the burette back to vertical and open the stopcock valve.
Let about 3 mL of liquid run out the bottom.
Close the stopcock and repeat the whole rinse at least two more times.
Repeat this rinse cycle with the titrant solution.
Rinse with distilled water after use.
Check for droplets on the side.
Cover the burette top with a paper cap.
Store in a glass locker away from dust.

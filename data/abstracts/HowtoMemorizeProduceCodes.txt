Walk around the produce section when you get the chance.
Study any weekly specials on produce.
Write down the codes for the most popular fruits and vegetables.
Use the same paper for other codes in the supermarket, whether it's liquor or a long code that needs to be pushed in manually.
Start another paper with different produce codes when you feel comfortable to move on.
Remember what the produce looks like and do a compare/contrast with others.

Draw a straight line using the protractor.
Align the protractor with both 0° and 180°on the center line, then mark the center point.

,
Trace the semicircle along the protractor from 0 ° to 180°.

,
Put the protractor on the other side of the center line, again with the both the 0°and 180° protractor markings on the center line.

,
Complete the circle by tracing along the protractor.

,
Calculate the angle between adjacent vertices, α.
Mark a point for each of the successive angles.
Join the points marked on the circle with a line segment.
Check to see that the sides are the same length.

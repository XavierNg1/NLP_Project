Understand the basic functions and components of a kegerator.
Obtain the necessary components.
Carefully read all instructions and warnings for all of the components.
Determine how the components should be placed in the refrigerator.
Choose a specific area of the refrigerator that can be safely drilled through in order to place the faucet shank.
Draw a circle or make a centered dot where you want to drill a hole in the refrigerator for the shank and faucet assembly.
Obtain a hole saw drill bit (generally 1 1/8", 1", 7/8" or 3/4") that will produce a hole that will neatly accommodate the faucet shank, and drill a hole.
Clean and sanitize the beer faucet, shank, beer line, and other associated components.
Insert the beer faucet and shank assembly through the refrigerator, and secure using included hardware.
Securely attach the gas line to the regulator outlet and to the keg gas line "in" connector or coupler gas inlet.
Verify that the CO2 cylinder is filled, completely shut off, and properly attached to the gas regulator.
Obtain a chilled keg of beer (warm beer will result in overly foamy beer).
Connect the beer line to the keg.
Connect the gas line to the keg.
Make sure that all connections are secure, and that the beer tap handle is in the closed position.
Pressurize the keg for dispensing.
Try dispensing some beer from the faucet, and check for beer leaks.
Periodically check for gas and beer leaks, and be sure to check the gas pressure that is indicated by the regulator.

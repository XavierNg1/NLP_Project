Make sure that leasing a car is the right option for you.
In addition to a down payment, figure out how much you can pay monthly for a lease agreement.
Find the car of your dreams (or the car of your current dream).
Take any interesting cars for a test drive.
Secure financing, if necessary, from a bank or credit union before you go to the dealer.
Negotiate the final purchase price first.
Once a final purchase price has been agreed upon and put in writing, negotiate the leasing terms.
Walk away if you think something is fishy, or suspect you're being taken advantage of.
Know the relationship between a car's residual value and monthly payments.The vehicleâ€™s residual value is the value of the car after you've finished leasing it; it's useful if you decide to buy the car after your lease is up.
Don't get so obsessed with the monthly payment number that you forget about fees.
Check for any rebates associated with the car.
Look over the lease agreement.
Enjoy your beautiful, new car.

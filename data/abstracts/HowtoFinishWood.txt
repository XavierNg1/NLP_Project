Continue applying the stain, brushing on a wet coat and then wiping away the excess before it dries.
Pick a finish for your wood.
Apply a finish to protect the wood from water damage, dirt, or stains.
Paint the finish onto your wood using a natural bristle brush.
Sand the finish down once it has dried.
Apply the second coat just like paint.

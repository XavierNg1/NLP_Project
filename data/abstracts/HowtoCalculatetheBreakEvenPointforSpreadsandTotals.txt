Know what Nevada offers you.

Note what they call big sports bettors - whales.
Compare the win percentage, to break even in Nevada, to your hometown friend - 52.4% to 54.5% respectively.
Make small bets with your hometown friend offering you 6/5 odds and save your big bets for Nevada where you have a good chance of breaking even or winning.
Review math (adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing fractions), probability and algebra and apply this to the other bets like parlays.

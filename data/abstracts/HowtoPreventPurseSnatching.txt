Leave your purse at home.
Bring only what you need.
Walk in busy, well-lit areas.
Be aware of the area and the people, especially if you find yourself having to walk in an isolated or lightly populated area.
Hold your purse tightly and close to your body, whether on a bus, train, or walking.
If you believe someone is following you don't turn around use a shiny object like a car mirror or window to look back.

,
Shorten the strap on your purse so you can carry it tightly between your elbow and body.

,
Remember that you come before your purse.
Report anything or anyone suspicious.

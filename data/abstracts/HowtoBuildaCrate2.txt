Dry fit two of the wider boards together along the long side.
Determine how you're going to adhere the two boards.
With the wood pressed together, use a pencil to mark three spots for dowels or biscuit joints.
Use your biscuit joint drill to make notches at each mark.
Apply wood glue to all three biscuit holes on one of the planks.
Insert a biscuit into each hole and firmly push it into place.
Add a little more glue to the top of each biscuit, then attach the two boards together.
Optional -- add handles to the ends.

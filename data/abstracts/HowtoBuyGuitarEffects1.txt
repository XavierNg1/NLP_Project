The point of effects is to make your guitar or bass sound better in its musical context or to make it sound new and different or even just to have fun making strange noises.
The most noticeable and commonly seen effects are those little 3" or 4" square boxes you often see on the floor in front of guitar or bass players.
Larger floor units with big buttons for players to push with their feet and multiple types of effects are common as well.

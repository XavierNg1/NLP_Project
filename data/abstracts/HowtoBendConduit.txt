Measure the length of conduit you’ll need.
Calculate the amount of extra conduit you will need.
Cut the conduit to the size you need, removing burrs from the cut end of the conduit.
Work with a bender, which is an essential of any conduit bending project.
Slide the conduit into the bender leaving the appropriate amount past the arrow on the bending shoe.
Pull the bender handle toward you to create the bend.
Bend until your bender reaches the 90° mark or other desired corner angle.
Check to make sure your bend is the right angle by either holding it up to the wall or using a level held snuggly against the front side of the pipe.
Learn how to air bend in a pinch.
Use the correct-sized bender for the type of conduit you're using.
Use a level and protractor to double-check the correctness of measurements.
On conduits with multiple bends, take your time to make sure the bends are aligned.
Experiment with different kinds of bends.

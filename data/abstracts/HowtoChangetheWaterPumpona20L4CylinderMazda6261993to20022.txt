Remove two short 10mm bolts (all bolts should be hex-head, unless some newer models use Torx/Star bolt heads) holding the power steering hose on where it crosses the valve cover and work the hose toward the left out of the way for removing the valve cover in a later step.
Remove spark plugs use a spark plug socket with a rubber grommet inside the socket so that it helps to lift plugs them out of the deep access ports.Prevent dirt, trash or any screws (or ceramic-glass pieces if you broke a spark plug) from falling into the cylinders any of which could cause very serious damage to the engine.
Loosen the harmonic pulley (but do not remove it at this time) retainer bolt (21mm, 13/16 inch) but keep it in but "finger-tight" (snug).
Consider using the power of the starter motor (only with the spark plugs taken out -- not holding the wrench by hand or foot).

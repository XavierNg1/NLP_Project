Play your way through the beginning of the level until you reach the level chapter 'Know Your Role' in the command centre for the base.
Look directly up at the ceiling.
Walk to the far end of the room, away from the monitors, until you have gone up two levels of stairs.
Walk directly below the lighting on the top level of the room and jump onto the green supports below the piping.
Move along the supports until you can jump up onto the large piping on which the skull is located.

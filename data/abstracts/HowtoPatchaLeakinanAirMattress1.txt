Know that all air mattresses lose air naturally.
Inflate the air mattress fully to test for a leak.
Check the valve holding in the air.
Stand the mattress up on its side in a quiet, large room to examine it for leaks.
Place your ear 2-3 inches away from the mattress and listen for hissing sounds.
Wet the back of your hand and repeat this process if you canâ€™t find anything.
Use soapy water to search for bubbles if you still cannot find the leak.
Circle the leak with a pen or sharpie.
Deflate and dry the mattress completely.

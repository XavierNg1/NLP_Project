Buy a pillow form.
Buy some fleece.
Stack two pieces of fleece on top of each other, with the wrong sides facing in.This is important, because you won't be turning the pillow inside-out afterwards.
Cut the fleece down so that it is 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) longer and 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wider than your pillow.
Cut a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) square out of each corner.This will make your fringe neater in the end.
Cut 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide, 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) deep slits along all four sides of your fleece.
Start tying the fringes together.
Slide your pillow form into your pillowcase.
Finish knotting the top of the pillow.

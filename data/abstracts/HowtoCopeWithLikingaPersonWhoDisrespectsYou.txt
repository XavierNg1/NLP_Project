Beware the glamor effect.
Find your own place of self respect.
Don't over-analyze their behavior.
Realize that you will have to get over this person.
Focus on why you should dislike this person's attitude toward you rather than on why you like them.
Protect yourself by disengaging.
Stop talking about this person to anyone else.
Get support from family and genuine friends or even from colleagues or team members you know you can trust.
Get on with your life in a more positive and self-thoughtful manner.

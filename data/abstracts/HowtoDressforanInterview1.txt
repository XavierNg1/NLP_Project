Start with pants.
Match your suit jacket to your pants.
Choose a solid white or blue shirt.
Wear a tie in a dark, conservative color.
Make sure that the tie you wear complements the color of your suit.
Wear either a belt or suspenders, but never both at the same time.
Pay attention to shoes and socks.
Don't be zealous with the cologne.

Play Laser Quest on a regular basis.
Know your equipment.
Know the arena.
Know the packs/vests.
Know the opponent's tactics.If you notice someone with a 'God Pack' then it's sometimes best just to totally avoid them because chances are you will get tagged if you try to attack.
Stand sideways.
Never stop tagging.Watch your back and make sure no one is tagging you from behind.
Find your opponent's weak sensors.
Be accurate, at most arenas you get accuracy bonuses and you could get up to 100 more points.Don't abuse the equipment, don't throw your laser on the floor, hit it against the wall, or take your pack off for no reason.
If your pack is broken go and inform the marshal.Follow the rules.People respect people who play by the rules plus they won't have a reason to discredit you if you do win the game.

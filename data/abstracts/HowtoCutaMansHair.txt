Ask the man how he wants his hair.
Choose a haircut that will suit the man's face and the amount of hair he has on his head.
Make sure that you have plenty of time.
Set up the work area.
Always start with clean hair: if you are using electric clippers, start with dry hair; if you are using only scissors, slightly damp hair is easier to work with.
Detangle his hair by running a comb through it.
Choose a clipper attachment.
Hold the clippers firmly between your thumb and first two fingers.
Start clipping at the base of his head.
Line up the back of the head.
Line up the sides.
Dampen the top of the man's head, and comb the hair forward.
Trim the top.
After cutting your entire line, comb the hair forward again and begin at the very front of the head.
Blend the top of the head.
Trim his bangs.
Blend scissor cuts with a clipper cut.
Trim his neck and sideburns.
Comb one last time after the entire head has been trimmed.
Wash or spritz his hair one more time, just to clean out any lingering hair clippings.
Sweep the floor before you let him out of the chair.

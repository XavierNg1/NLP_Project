Realize that you're going to experience some rejection and steel yourself for it.
Ignore much of the advice you read in mainstream books on internet dating.
Listen to the whispers of your soul.
Be proactive.
Think about the note you're writing.
Develop a system.
Do not post a picture.
Write a good profile.
During your first date, don't talk so much.
During phone conversations or that first date, don't fear the silences.
Write out a mission statement.
The most important thing you can do: Be persistent.

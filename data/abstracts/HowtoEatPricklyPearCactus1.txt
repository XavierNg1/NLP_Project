Buy or forage some prickly pear pads.
Remove the spines from the pad by using a vegetable peeler or a paring knife.
Run the pad under cool water.
Slice or cut the pads (wipe the knife blade after each slice, as there can be small spines sticking to it), or leave them whole, depending on what you will be using the nopales for.

,
Cook the nopales.

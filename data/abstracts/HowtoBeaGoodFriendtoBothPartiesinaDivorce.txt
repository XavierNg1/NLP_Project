Tell them both that you will not choose sides.
If you do find yourself siding with one, limit contact with the other.
Reveal no opinion on who is right or wrong.
Expect anything you say to one to get back to the other.
Resist answering emails from either of them.
If all else fails, detach from both for the duration.
Listen.
Pray.

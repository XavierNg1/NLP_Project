Look around your bathroom, Can't find anything?,
There are 2 different ways you can do a facial 1 you can buy facial stuff, or 2 you can go natural.
If you decided to get some facial stuff here is a list of facial masks and other.
If you don't have any moisturizers the next best thing is lotion.
There is one last treatment you can do, I like to call it the steam.
This is the order you should do your facial in.
If you chose to go natural, first use your soaps in any order, then rub the mashed fruit on your face.
Now your finished whichever way you did it and had a great time doing it!

Choose a diary that is obviously a diary.
Consider what it is you'd like to add to the diary to make the seeker realize that they've been rumbled.
Spend a lot of time writing in your diary in obvious view.
Casually drop comments about needing to write in your diary when around those you'd like to want to read it.
If someone asks you about what your writing or they try to look, press it against your chest so no one can see and quickly say "Nothing!",
Never leave your diary unattended.
Keep your diary in a great hiding spot.

Use barre chords to play minors, majors, sevenths, and much more anywhere on the neck.
Bar across all 6 strings with your first finger, covering every string on that fret.
Set the rest of your fingers up as if you were playing an open E chord to play a major barre chord.
To make a minor chord, move the whole form down one string, ignoring the top string.
Play a seventh barre chord by simply removing your pinky finger from a major barre chord.
Drop the 7th down a string or remove your ring finger to make a minor 7th.
Drop the bottom strings if you're having trouble nailing barre chords at first.

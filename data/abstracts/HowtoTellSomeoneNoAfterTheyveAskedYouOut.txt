Think before you speak.
Weigh the pros and cons.
If you find that there are more cons than pros to dating this person, you should most likely tell them "no".
After you've decided to decline their offer, find the asker the next day, and ask to talk to them privately.
Tell them you've made your decision.Explain why you can't go out with them without getting into detail

,
Add that you're impressed with them asking you.
If the person starts crying say sorry and then politely excuse yourself.They need their space.

It might be a little awkward for you and the asker to see each other.

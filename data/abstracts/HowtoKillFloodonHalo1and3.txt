On Halo 1, a shotgun will take care of Combat Forms in the most expedient way possible (excepting a rocket launcher or any type of explosive).
On Halo 3, there are Flood Pure Forms, which are a lot harder to kill.
For Halo 3 The Flood can be generally be easily killed on any difficulty, the only time they put up a decent fight is when you are playing on Heroic difficulty, and they can be an actual challenge when you play on Legendary difficulty.
When you encounter a Tank Flood Form,UNSC weapons are weak against these huge things!If you find an Energy Sword or rocket launcher,and fuel rod cannon kill them quickly they can also pack a punch!

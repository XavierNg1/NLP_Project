Make sure that there is snow in the spot that you would like to sled on.
Get to the top of a hill and take care to pick a hill that isn't too large.
Know that you now need your trash bag.
Shove off.
Understand that if you are using multiple bags, then at this point you need to hold them together so they don't come apart while you are sledding.
Make sure that when you reach the bottom, you put your hands down to stop.
Finished.

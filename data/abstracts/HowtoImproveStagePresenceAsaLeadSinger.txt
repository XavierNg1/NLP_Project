Love the songs you sing.
Smile as much as you can.
Move around!,
Steal moves from the big guys.
Learn to use facial expressions and poses to go with the emotions.
Learn when NOT to grab attention.
Talk to your audience.
If you play an instrument too (while singing), such as guitar or bass, and cannot move that much, use facial expressions or your arms and hands the most you can to make the crowd follow you and have a good vibe.

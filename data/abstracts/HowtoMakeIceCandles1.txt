Get a suitable mold, then set it aside.
Assemble your double boiler.
Measure out your wax, then add it to the pouring pot.
Melt the wax until it reaches 175 to 185°F (80 to 85°C).
Consider adding some fragrance and/or color to your wax.
Attach your tabbed wick to the bottom of the mold.
Fill the mold one-half to three-fourths of the way with ice.
Pour the wax into the mold until it completely covers the ice.
Wait for the wax to harden.
Consider doing a second pour in a contrasting color.
Take the candle out of the mold.
Leave the candle in a sink or bowl for a few days so that the water can drain.
Trim the wick down to ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter), ten use your candle.Trimming the wick down will prevent the wax from smoking as it burns.

Decide what it is that you'd like to learn via music about English.
Understand that there are hundreds, maybe even thousands of songs that have been written in English about any topic that you can possibly think of.
Put the songs into an iPod or music device.
Begin to try to sing them through.
Sing the songs once a day.
Ask someone who speaks English if they will let you sing one of the songs.
Make little songs to remember things with, because music is an international language!,
Be patient with yourself.

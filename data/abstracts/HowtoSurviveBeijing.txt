Avoid visiting in the height of summer (June-August) as it is blisteringly hot, or going in the winter months (November-March) as it gets so cold!,
Whatever time of year you visit, take multivitamins with you to keep your immune system up.
Keep an eye on your possessions, especially when you are carrying valuables with you.
Remember is that you can say no.
Don't jump at everyone who tries to speak to you.
Learn some Chinese before you go.
Although it is said that everything in China is negotiable, it's best to save the haggling for the markets.
As well as learning some of the language, make sure to research a bit of the culture too, so you know what is and isn't okay.
Bear this in mind, but don't let it overwhelm you.

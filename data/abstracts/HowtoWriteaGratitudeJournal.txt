Buy a notebook with lots of blank pages.
Look at the basic things you have.
Take notice of your talents and the activities you enjoy.
Visit your love ones.
Listen to the sounds of earth.
Taste wonderful things.
Smell great odors.
Notice peopleâ€™s kindness.
Touch things around you.
Take a hard look at your life.

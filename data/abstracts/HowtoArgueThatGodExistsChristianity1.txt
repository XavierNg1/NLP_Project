Use the Bible as a narrative, accurate and poetic source for understanding God intervening (interfering) in everyday events (but not forcing) and the development of Judaism through earliest Christianity, and that it is also a spiritual road map of creation and reveals God's higher purpose and plan for mankind.
Ask those that do not believe in God to account for the Bibleâ€™s accuracy, i.e.
Show the picture of God that the Bible paints in words as the revelation of the one-and-only-God who is omniscient (all knowing, observing and testing all things), omnipotent, having an image but no ordinary-material being, omnipresent, eternal, immutable, indivisible, giving free choices (freedom) with many resulting consequences/rewards, and His being all caring, accounting for His perfect love.
Discuss how one known as Jesus fulfilled dozens of Old Testament Messianic Prophecies and did things which no ordinary person could ever do.
Elaborate on the issue of an imperfect world but one in which the possibility of a focus on the "good" (or optimum) result conspicuously outweighs the hopeless life that anyone could imagine as possibly much worse -- if it were simply accidental or unintended and at the mercy of physical non-living aspects of the universe which features corruption, decay, breakage, erosion versus the amazingly self-healing forms of life and human-life which may visualize, be hopeful, build and improve many things.
Explain that there are many examples showing God's existence, but one has to be able to look and realize its truth.

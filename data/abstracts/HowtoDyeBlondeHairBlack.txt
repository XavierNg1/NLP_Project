Purchase either a semi-permanent (28 days) or permanent brown dye.
Ask someone to help you if you've never dyed your hair.
Dye your hair the brown color by following the package's directions.
Repeat the step you used for the brown with the black dye, but make sure you note whether your hair should be damp or not.
Finished.

Bend two angle clips to attach the wagon handle with.
Mount these brackets at the center of the swivel/axle assembly, allowing space for the pull handle to fit between them freely.
Rip the stock, (described in the step, above), sand the edges smooth, and position it between the brackets so the attaching bolt can be inserted.
Build the yoke that will hold the grip at the other end of the handle.
Fit a block of wood 1 inch (2.5cm) square between the ends of the yoke.
Thread the bolt or all-thread rod through the yoke, the handle block, and out the other side of the yoke.
Tighten the assembly.

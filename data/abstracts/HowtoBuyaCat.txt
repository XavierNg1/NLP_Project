Make sure everyone in your home is ready to get a cat.
Think about what kind of cat you want.
Get the supplies you need.Before bringing a cat home, you’ll want to make sure you have everything it needs to adjust to its new home.
Cat-proof your home.
Plan to visit a veterinarian.
Consider getting pet insurance.Pet insurance policies usually don’t cover routine shots (which owners should get anyway), but getting a policy can save you from worrying about being able to cover the costs if the cat ever becomes sick or injured.

,
Consider getting a cat from an animal shelter.Your local animal shelter probably has many excellent cats who are in need of a good home, and most animal societies will suggest this as the first place to start looking for a cat.
Look for cats available from rescue groups.Much like animal shelters, cat rescue groups have many felines ready to find good homes.
Research local pet stores.Some pet stores may sell kittens.
Choose a reputable breeder if you want a purebred cat.If you are certain that you want a particular breed of cat, your best choice is a good breeder.
Be wary of free kittens.It is often relatively easy to find offers of “free kittens” or “kittens free to a good home” online, on community bulletin boards, advertised in newspapers, etc.
Inspect a kitten carefully before you buy it.Cats purchased from breeders should be in excellent health.
Expect questions from an animal shelter or breeder.Before letting you take a cat home, good breeders or animal shelters will want to make sure that you are prepared to take care of it.

Purchase a crab pot.
Acquire bait.
Be sure to have a 15 foot (4.6 m) length of cord and a buoy.
Bait the crab pot with a single bunker.
Set your trap.
When first testing an area you may want to check the pot in 20 - 30 minutes to see if there are crabs in the area.

,
Notice that the best areas for crabs are where the water is moving.
When you get to your crabbing spot, tie one end of a 5–6 foot (1.5–1.8 m) line on to your stick.
Tie a piece of your bait securely at the other end of your line.

,
Drop your bait into the water holding securely onto your stick.

,
Wait for the tug of the crab eating your bait.

,
When you feel a nibble, slowly raise the line to the surface.
Either drop the crab into your bucket or use your net to grab your prey and then drop it in the bucket from the net.

,
Crabs should not be without water or air for too long.

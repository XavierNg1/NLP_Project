Have all the required materials ready before you start to remove the motorbike tire.
Let all the air out of the tire with the valve core tool.
Draw an arrow at the edge of the rim with your pencil so you can see the direction of the spin of the wheel.
Detach the bead (the inner edge of the tire) from the rim using the bead breaker tool.
Spray silicone lubricant on the tire bead to help it come out.
Alternatively, use two C-clamps to push the bead out.
Use two tire levers to pry the bead up and over the rim.
Break the bead and pry out the tire on the other side to remove the rim.

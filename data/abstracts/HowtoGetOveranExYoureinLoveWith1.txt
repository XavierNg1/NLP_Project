Time Apart.
No tracking them down.
Hide away things that remind you of them, such as letters, cards, gifts etc.
Don’t consider hooking up with them if you know you’re both not going to be sober/at a party etc.
Select a few close friends whom you can talk to about your feelings about your ex and the breakup.
Throughout this whole process, cry, whenever you want to.

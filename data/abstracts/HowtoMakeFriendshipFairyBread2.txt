Cut off the crusts of your bread.
Place a serving plate in front of you.
Separate the triangles of bread into two stacks - one for butter and one for jam.
Repeat the spreading and 'sticking' process.
Take the last pieces of bread, and spread either butter or jam - whatever comes next in the order of which you placed the other slices of bread.
Spread jam all over the "sides" of the square fairy bread stack.
Keep on creating the 100s and 1000s 'shell' until all the sides have been covered.
Enjoy!

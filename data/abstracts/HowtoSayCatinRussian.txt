If you are talking about a single she-cat, say 'koshka' (кошка).You pronounce the 'k' as in 'kind', 'o' as in 'boy', 'sh' as in 'shun', and 'ka' as in 'card'.
If you are talking about a single he-cat, say 'kot'.
If you would like to call the cat using diminutive form (like Jake for Jakeson or Liz/Lisa/Beth for Elizabeth), you can use 'koshechka' (кошечка) for female and 'kotik' (котик) for male.
If you are talking about more than one cat, you must use the plural form of the word.
If you are talking about a kitten or kittens, use 'kotyonok' (котёнок) to say kitten and 'kotyata' (котята) to say kittens.

Move your positioning lines to the middle of the third island, slightly to the left and the words "restricted area" should appear.

Follow the road up to the area and you will arrive at a big fenced gate which doesn't open.

Walk up until you hit the roof and can hear the engine of your freeway motorbike, then press triangle and you should end up back on it.

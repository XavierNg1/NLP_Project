Pick out a lizard that lives wild in your area.
Research care and local laws on the internet or in books.
Create as large of a home as you can for your pet, making sure that you provide temperatures and hiding places.
Catch one out in the wild:


Look in local forest areas, desert areas, fields etc.
Make an inviting trap for your lizard:


Take some cardboard, poster board, or foam core and cut it at least as big as the opening of the tank or box.
Make a meal for your lizard:


Get a food that is appropriate for the lizard's size, like a cricket or something to that effect.
When the lizard comes to get the food, drop the box or aquarium on it and you've got your pet.

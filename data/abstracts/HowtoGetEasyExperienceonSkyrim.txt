In the beginning of the game, during the tutorial when it gives you a choice whether to go with Hadvar or Rolof, choose Hadvar.
Allow him to take your bindings off.
Don't get the supplies from the chest, just get the iron sword off the wall.
Equip the sword.
Sneak towards him.
Pull out your sword by clicking the X button.
Quit attacking when he falls down.
If you want to raise your two-handed skill, progress farther into the game.
When he falls down, hold on until he stands up again.

Prepare the dough by mixing together the flour and yeast in the large mixing bowl.
Coat the inside of the medium-size mixing bowl with olive or canola oil.
Use a plastic scraper to move the artisan bread dough to the oil-coated bowl.
Let the dough sit for up to 18 hours before you want to bake bread.
Sprinkle some flour on the countertop or other work surface after the dough has rested.
Fold the dough in half one way, then in half the other way.
Drape the plastic wrap or towel over the bread dough, and let it rest for about 15 minutes.
Shape the dough into a ball after the 15 minutes are complete.
Move the dough to the silicone baking mat, and cover it with the inverted mixing bowl, plastic wrap, or towel.
Heat the oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit (246 degrees Celsius) at least 1 hour before you want to bake the bread.
Lift up the silicone baking mat, and slide the dough from the mat into the Dutch oven or casserole dish.
Bake the bread for 30 minutes with the lid on.
Cool the bread before slicing and eating.

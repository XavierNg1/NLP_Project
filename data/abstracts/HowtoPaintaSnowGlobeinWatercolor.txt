Understand that observing the real thing is optimal, but looking at pictures of snow globes you find online is fine, too.
Find a 4-5" round object the size you want to make your globe, such as a plastic lid, bottle or jar.
For the interior of the globe, create a tiny world, so include what strikes your fancy.
Use a ruler to draw a horizontal line on either side of the globe.
Prepare your paint.
Paint the scene and base and let the piece dry.
Paint the background a very dark shade, to make the glass appear to shine and give the illusion of depth behind the globe.
Add a curved shadow around the base of the globe, anchoring it onto the table and creating depth.
Make your template for the snow.
Create the magic of transparent glass with the shadows and highlights on the exterior of the glass.
Study the piece and see if, from a distance, it sparkles.

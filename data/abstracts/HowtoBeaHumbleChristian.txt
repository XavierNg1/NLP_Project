Realize that any gift or ability you may have came from God.
Always see that God is God, and you are not.
Do something that keeps you humble, such as house cleaning.
Realize that you might be wrong on some things.
See and treat others as better than yourself.
Continuously be willing to see your sin.
Don't boast about what you do for God's kingdom.
Never, therefore, seek to please man, certainly not the powerful or rich self-serving people.

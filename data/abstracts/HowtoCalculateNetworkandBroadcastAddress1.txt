For a classful network total bits is 8.
From the previous step, you got the "Number of bits used for subnetting"(n) and you know the "Tb", then you can get "Number of bits left for host"(m) = Tb - n as total bits is the summation of number of bits used for subnetting and number bits left for host i.e.
Now you have to calculate "Number of subnets" = 2n and "Value of last bit used for subnet masking"(Δ) = 2m.
Now you can find previously calculated number of subnets by separating subnets each having "Value of last bit used for subnet masking" or Δ addresses.
Now you have to find that your IP address is in which subnet, that subnet's first address is network address and last address is broadcast address.

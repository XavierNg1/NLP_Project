Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil on the stove over medium heat.
Add the whole chopped onion, a teaspoon of salt, and stir.
Add 2-3 finely chopped cloves of garlic as the onion is cooking.
Optionally, add 1 cup of red wine to the pan and stir, cooking until most of the liquid is gone.
Once the onions have softened, add one 28-ounce cans of plum tomatoes, with juices, and stir.
Add in salt, pepper, and any desired spices, like a bunch of fresh basil.
Bring briefly to a boil, then simmer until thickened and ready to eat.

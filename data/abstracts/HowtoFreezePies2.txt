Avoid freezing your custard- or cream- based pies, if possible.
Freeze the pie in two parts.
Thaw the custard filling in your refrigerator.If you thaw the custard, cream, or pumpkin filling at room temperature, the filling will become watery and may result in a soggy pie.
Bake the pie crust first and then add the filling and finish baking the pie.

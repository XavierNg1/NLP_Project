Ask your doctor about endometriosis.Endometriosis is a painful condition that results when endometrium tissue (the tissue that normally lines the uterus) is found outside of the uterus and causes pain every month during your period.
Consider endometrial ablation.If you are an older woman who is no longer seeking to become pregnant, another way to handle painful menstrual cramps is through a surgical procedure called endometrial ablation.
Always see your doctor in more severe cases of menstrual pain.

Find out which foods are healthy.
Make a list of healthy foods versus unhealthy foods.
Shop for food at stores that give you healthy alternatives.
Keep your kitchen stocked with staples such as whole grain bread, brown rice, grains, butter, low-fat cheese, lean lunch meat (ham, turkey, roast beef), fruit, vegetables, nuts (if you are not allergic), low-fat yogurt, juice, and filtered water.
Vary the kinds of lunches you pack on a daily basis so that you donâ€™t get bored.
If you like to end your lunch with something sweet, include items such as low-fat yogurt, fruit rolls, or trail mix.
Make sure you have reusable containers and lunch bags on hand.
If you are not used to bringing your own lunch, schedule a regular time in your daily routine to make your meal ahead of time.
If you have children, have them prepare lunch with you.

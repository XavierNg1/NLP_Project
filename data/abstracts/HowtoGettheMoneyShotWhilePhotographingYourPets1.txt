Leave the animal alone until you are ready to shoot their photographs.
Set up the area appropriately.
Be sure you have everything you will need.
Make sure that your pet is cleaned up and looking the best that he can be.
Have someone with you when photographing the pets.
Try to experiment with lighting with replacement subjects.
Bring the pet to the 'studio' once you are ready.

The first step in becoming Oshare Kei is having the right make up.
Now, you need the clothing.
Wear shirts with cute patterns and motifs.
Jackets are cute.
Skirts or pants are obviously important (don't want to go without them now do we?).
Ripped jeans with bright leggings/socks underneath work good too, and shorts with socks/leggings (as Miku from An Cafe demonstrates oh-so well).

,
Knee high socks are good.
You can wear bracelets, but not too many (unless you want to of course!).
Necklaces with cute things on them are good.
Have clean and shiny hair.
Some people put gems and stickers on their face.
Piercings look good in Oshare Kei, but you don't need them, as they are painful and leave scars.
Try different kinds of shoes.
Listen to the music, obviously.
You could also listen to Visual Kei bands such as The GazettE, Versailles, Direngrey, Miyavi and Nightmare.
Make sure you don't look 'cosplay'.

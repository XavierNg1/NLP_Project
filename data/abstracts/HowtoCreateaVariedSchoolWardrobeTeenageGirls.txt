Clean out the clothes in your existing closet.
Go shopping with a good friend you trust and whose style you like.
Go to a shop with reasonable prices: while thrift stores are not necessary (but actually a very good source of extremely cheap yet stylish clothing), don't go to an expensive store where only two clothes can be purchased.

,
If name brands are important to you, it's okay to buy a pair of jeans or a sweater from an expensive store but it may not be a smart move to spend all your money in stores where you won't get as much bang for your buck.

,
Buy about two or three pairs of shorts, three pairs of jeans, two pairs of pants and two pairs of leggings.
Buy good tops.
Choose good shoes.
Don't forget accessories.
Organize everything in your closet.
Organize one shelf, or part of it, for accessories.
Fold towels into one rack.

First of all, Massie doesn't go shopping by herself.
Gasp!,
Go into Gucci, Prada, buy things like a pair of D&G sunglasses or a Juicy Couture bag (only if you live near one, like in New York City).
Go into Hollister Co. Abercrombie and Fitch, Aerie, Juicy Couture, H&M, Aeropostale, etc.
Don't buy something you hate, just because it's materialistic.
Go to the spa with your friends; get a manicure, but no pedicures.
Go back to your house and make face masks and stuff.
Go to the hairdresser daily.
Post your outfits before you wear them on polyvore.com.

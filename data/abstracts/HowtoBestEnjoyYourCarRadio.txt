Take note of what genres of music you like.
Flip through each FM station on your car radio when you are sitting still.
Decide which stations are your favorite.
When you start driving somewhere, pick the station you wish to hear by default at the time.
If the station starts playing a song you dislike or a commercial break, move onto another station.

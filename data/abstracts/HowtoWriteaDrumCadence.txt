Have a basic knowledge of notes, time signature, rhythm, and pitch.
Keep it simple.
Put down the sticks.
Tap out some quarter notes and say, (don't tap), a rhythm that pops into mind.
Repeat last step until a fluent piece is written.
Go through the cadence one measure at a time and think of a cool bassline.
Go through both parts of the whole cadence and look for opportunities to work in rudiments, e.g.
Go through once more and finalize those two parts.
Begin the quints/quads part.
Incorporate more than one drum.
Ask a friend or a colleague who is experienced in writing cymbal literature to write a cymbal part to the cadence.
Balance and regulate.
Know where the most powerful parts are in the music.
Most importantly, practice.

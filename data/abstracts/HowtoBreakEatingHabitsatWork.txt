Understand social behavior spread: Behaviors, physical and mental, are social contagions, meaning they spread from one person to the next.
Mind the eating habits taken home from work: Nutrition habits can also spread past the workplace.
Have a best friend with the same goal: At work, this can especially influence your diet.
Aim for a healthy work culture: A company’s culture is also highly influential.
Practice mindfulness: Try practicing mindful eating.
Establish new habits: For example, you can agree to eat half a donut because, one, you will eat less, and two, you will start a new habit of self-control.
Eliminate cues you associate with appetite: Cravings are situational, meaning they don’t always follow you everywhere you go.

Break out of your comfort zone.
Write out everything you know on your favourite key including chords, scales, chord structures, scale patterns, and licks.
Devote at least two hours daily to practice.
Practice until you have developed muscle memory (you can play it without much effort).
Don't be afraid of mistakes.
As you move from one key to another, do this in perfect fourths or fifths.
Practice all the triads (major, minor, diminished and augmented).
Practice the seventh chords (Maj.7, Min.7, Dim.7, Dom.7, etc).
Afterwards, begin to learn standard progressions and their substitutions on each key, one at a time.
Begin to incorporate all the licks you already know on your favourite key into all other keys, one by one.

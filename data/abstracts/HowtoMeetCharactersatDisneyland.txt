Look towards the Times Guide you can pick up at the park's entrance.
Try to plan your day around a schedule that is set up to meet with the characters.

Try to determine well in advance where the characters you are intending to meet can be found, so that you waddle over to the area with your kids, so they can meet with the characters in a way they feel most comfortable meeting with them.
Know when and where they make special appearances.
Know the difference between the classic characters and those of the special characters that may have been jazzed up for other occasions.
Don't look to meet many characters in some areas of Disneyland's California Adventure Theme Park.
Walk with your kids around the park in the direction of the area the character is to be expected to meet with guests on the given day.

Realize that some characters may not even be staged in any of the areas, and some may be walking the park much like you, the guest, do.
Have an autograph book, camera and pen ready if you find this situation to be happening with the character nearby.
Have the child interact with the character, if the character doesn't have other children nearby.

Crumble the feta cheese.
Mix the beaten eggs into the feta.
Melt the butter over low heat and keep it warm.
Unfold the filo and spread it on waxed paper.
Use clean scissors or a sharp knife to cut the filo sheets into strips about 4 inches (10cm) wide.
Work with a moderate number of sheets at a time, perhaps a dozen or so.
Spread a generous length of waxed paper onto a table and have the filling, melted butter, pastry brush, trays or baking sheets, and filo close at hand.
,
Lay a strip of filo on waxed paper and brush it generously with warm, melted butter.
Place one to two tablespoons of the feta mixture on one end of a strip of filo.
Fold the filo around the filling on a diagonal so that the corner meets the opposite edge.
,
Fold the tiropita straight up, following the edge.
,
Repeat the diagonal and straight folding until you reach the end.
Brush the entire outside surface with more melted butter.
,
Lay the tiropita on a baking sheet in a single layer with a little space in between them.
Bake at 375ºF (190ºC) for 15-20 minutes, until golden brown and crispy.

Obviously you are going to need to install the game and finish the solo game.
Presuming that you are relatively knowledgeable about this particular map I am going to plow right in and tell you that to get beyond level 10 is going to be extremely hard without a buddy to help you out.
You start off in a room on the ground floor.
Once you have the rifle, assign windows to each of your team members.
Stay on the ground floor until either the zombies start overwhelming you or around level 6.
Head into the room and immediately station 1 guy at the box on your left (as you enter the room).
When the guy at the box runs out of cash or gets a Ray Gun he needs to swap out with another guy and then repeat the step above.

Once all your members have a ray gun or you are overwhelmed by zombies, head upstairs (in that same room) by going up to the couch/sofa and press E (again, the guy with the most cash does this).
Great, now you are upstairs.
If one of your members still doesn't have a Ray Gun at this point, all is not lost!

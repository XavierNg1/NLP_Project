Start by building a sturdy table.
Drill holes for the pendulums.
Mount two metal plates (about 1Â¼" x 4") on the sides of the two lateral pendulum holes, and drill a small indentation in the center of each plate.
Build the pendulums.
Insert a dowel through the 3/4" hole in each fulcrum block.
Build the gimbal.
File down the bottom edges of these blocks as needed so the pendulum doesn't hit them when it swings.
Attach the weights.
Create the paper platform.
Create the arms.
Finally attach the two arms together with a doubled-over rubber band as shown.
Fashion a pen holder.
Make the pen lifter.
Attach an oak block under the table for a deeper hole and better support.

,
Tie a string to the balsa arms where they are connected together, lead it through a screw-eye on top of the pole, and back down to a small jam cleat or groove where it can hold the pen in place above the paper until you are ready to lower it.

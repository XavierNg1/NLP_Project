Place a square cloth napkin on the table in front of you at an angle so it looks like a diamond.
Pull the bottom corner up to the top corner of the napkin.
Lay down your dinner knife along the bottom edge.
Fold the bottom edge of the napkin over onto the silverware and smooth it out across the new seam line.
Hold tight against the edge of the cutlery and roll the napkin toward the top corner.
Secure the roll by using a napkin ring or a piece of ribbon.

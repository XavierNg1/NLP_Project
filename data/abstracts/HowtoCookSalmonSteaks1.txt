Purchase your salmon steaks.
Make a marinade.
Pour the marinade in a plastic bag.
Preheat your grill on medium heat, or about 400 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (204 to 232 Celsius).
Remove the salmon from the bag and onto a paper towel to soak up some of the excess liquid.
Set the salmon steaks on the hot grill.
Serve plain or with sauce.

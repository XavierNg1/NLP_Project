Before drying, know the properties of your wood.
Gather and stack wood at the right time of year.
Chop the wood in readiness for storage.
Store the wood outdoors.
Stack the wood so it isn't sitting directly on the ground or right up against a wall.
Allow space between the stack and a wall to allow air to move.
Ensure that the top of the wood is covered to allow rain (or snow) to run off without soaking the wood.
Check for wood dryness.

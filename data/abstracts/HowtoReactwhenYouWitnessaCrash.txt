First off, and most importantly, stay calm.
The first thing to do is call 9-1-1 or get someone else to.
Do not move the victim.
Unless the situation is very dire, wait for the emergency services to arrive.
If lives are in danger (such as the occurrence of fire/explosion) you can act, especially if it will be some time before the paramedics arrive on the scene.

If necessary, get the individual(s) out of the plane/train/car/etc.
By that point, the paramedics should be on scene.

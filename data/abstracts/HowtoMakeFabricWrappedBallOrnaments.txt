Assemble the items needed for this project.
Make strips from your fabric scraps if they're not already in strips.
Place a pin through the end of one strip anywhere on the ball to get it started.
Continue in this manner until the whole ball has been covered.
Consider improving the pins.
Attach ribbon, string or other trim to the top of the ball so that it can hang from a tree or other display area.

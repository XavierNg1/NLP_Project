Set up an area where you can display your harvest items.
Sweep and remove any debris away from the area you intend to use.
Set up a feeder where you can have all purpose birdseed (including sunflower seeds and cracked corn).
Not forgetting our squirrel and chipmunk friends, use a low hanging or even ground feeder and set out birdseed there also.
To make sure your local wildlife has enough to drink, set out a bird bath and fill it with fresh clean water.
Put out a bale of hay or straw in your designated area.
Set up corn shocks.
Have pumpkins and other assorted gourds and squashes set out for the animals.
Enjoy all the wildlife that comes to your backyard.

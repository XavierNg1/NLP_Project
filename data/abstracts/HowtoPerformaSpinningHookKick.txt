Make sure you can properly do a Hook Kick in the first place.
Get in the fighting stance.
Fists clenched tight and strong, legs digging deep into the ground stable, get ready to turn.
To spin more quickly and confidently, therefore having more momentum and power in your kick, begin to swing your arms around with the stepping of your non-kicking leg in front of you.

Now, you've spun about 180 degrees and are looking over your kicking leg's shoulder.
Now comes the actual kick.
Now back to the Spinning Hook Kick.
Once you have done this, bring your kicking foot back to your side, and your other leg will naturally pivot along with it but this time as you are back in stance, your right leg will be behind you and your left leg will be in front of you.

From here you can finish your opponent off with a roundhouse kick to your opponents gut-better your opponents head again.

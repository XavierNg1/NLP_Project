Compared to the Dot Plot.
Creating the 'One-Dot' is very simple, it may require a little bit more work but it's worth it when it comes to saving you time.
This time you will be labeling the left side of the plot as well as the bottom, opposed to just labeling the bottom.
Just as you would do to the dot plot, you must label the bottom depending on your data that you have.
Finished.

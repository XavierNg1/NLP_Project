Remember that those who make fun of others based on their wearing of religious garments are usually ignorant and intolerant of others whose beliefs differ from their own religious beliefs.
Educate others by discussing your beliefs, when appropriate.
If you are at school, Enlist the help of the principal to sponsor a religious tolerance day.
Speak to your spiritual leader about your situation.
Call the police if the situation becomes violent.

Create a secret or a secret mission.
Read a few clique-like books, like the clique series by Lisi Harrison, for some background information, although, maybe not so mean like they were.
Think of a name.
Conduct a proper initiation for you and your closest friend.
Figure out what your society does.
Find potential members.
Induct your members.
An important thing in secret societies is to meet in secret, that means meeting in a new place every time or having access to a secret room somewhere.
Make a dress code.
Keep quiet and have fun.
Initiate well to do people in the society.
At first, be friendly, but do not reveal the central secrets of your society.
There needs to be a way to get rid of someone if they become bad for the group or start talkingâ€”like blabbing the society's secret.

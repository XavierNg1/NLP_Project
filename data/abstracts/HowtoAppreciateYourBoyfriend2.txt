Tell him why you appreciate him.This may seem obvious, and you may think it is obvious to your partner, but it certainly wonâ€™t hurt to explain the reasons why you appreciate him.It may seem silly, but the little things can make all the difference in a relationship.
Give him compliments.
Become aware of the little things your boyfriend does for you.
Ask him about his day/week.When you see your boyfriend (either when he comes home or when you see him), ask him to tell you about his day/week.

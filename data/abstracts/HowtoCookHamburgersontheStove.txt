Get some hamburger meat!,
Season your hamburger meat with some salt and pepper and then start breaking them up into hamburger patties.
Have you ever had a hamburger with a big round bump in the middle?,
Whip out your fancy frying pan and put a little oil in the bottom.
Allow the patties to sit for roughly four to five minute and then use a fork or spatula to flip them over to the other side.
Keep an eye on the burgers while they are finishing up cooking.
Once your burgers are finished cooking, just slap them on some buns, give to your friends and family and enjoy!

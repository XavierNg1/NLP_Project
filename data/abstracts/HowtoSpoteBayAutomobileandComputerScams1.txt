With cars, you will generally find that scammers try to get you to send them money in advance, for whatever reason.
But there never was a car!,
While it's not an outright scam, what you might find is that the car does turn up, but simply doesn't live up to the description - it has been oversold, in the tradition of used car dealers through the ages.

Care for your hair.
Brush or comb your hair every day, getting all the tangles out.
Define your personality.
Consider new styles.
Start slowly.
Ask your friends what they think would look great on you, and ask the one's with the coolest hairstyles where they got it done.

If you don't want to cut your hair, change up your old one instead.

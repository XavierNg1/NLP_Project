Download the software PC Inspector Clonemaxx; it is a free download of only 750KB.
Do not run the Clonemaxx file yet.
Prepare the PC.
Open up the PC case so that the new drive can be added.
Don't bother mounting the new drive into the case, but just lay it flat on the desk, or inside the PC.
Start up the PC again.
When the PC has opened normally, then run the downloaded Clonemaxx.exe file.
Restart the PC with the newly-made floppy disk in place OR with CD in CD drive, which you have burnt in last step (Note: Setup your bios to boot from cd on priority), and follow the instructions given by the program.
Test the new drive.
Tidy up.

Find a natural opening on a rabbit trail for best results.
Cut down a large tree branch or a small tree to further funnel any rabbits into your snare.
Place the tree branch over the rabbit trail, making sure that the bare strip of branch is centered over the trail.
Drive small stakes of wood into the ground at both the sides of the snare.
Take thin copper or brass wire and tie a small loop at one end.
Cut the other end of the wire after approximately 2 feet (.6 m).

,
Feed the cut end of the wire through the loop end, creating a small noose.
Attach the standing end of the noose onto the tree or tree branch that you placed over the rabbit trail.
Place two more small sticks into the ground in an "X" pattern at the bottom of the snare.
Mark the location of the snare with some red fabric and check the snare every day.

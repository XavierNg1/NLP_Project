Recognize the symptoms of a heart attack.A heart attack occurs when the arteries that feed blood to your heart get clogged, blocking off blood flow.
Seek immediate emergency attention.Either call emergency services or ask someone to take you to the emergency room.
Take aspirin if you're not allergic.Most blockages that lead to heart attack are the result of clot-causing platelets (blood cells) that are attracted to a plaque buildup from cholesterol.
Get as comfortable as possible.You don't want to move around or do anything to get your blood pumping, as this could cause further damage to the heart.

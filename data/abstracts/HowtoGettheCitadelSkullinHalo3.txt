Begin a Forge session on the Citadel map.
Enter editor mode (or oracle form) by pressing UP on the D-Pad once you have begun play.
Move past the overshield spawn towards the blue side of the map.
Stop in front of the two white-blue, triangular light panels on the wall directly after the overshield tunnel.
Look up the wall to the ceiling, directly above the triangular lights.
Spawn a grav lift in Forge mode.
Move the grav lift, while you are still holding it, into the ceiling gap, just to the right of the centre beam.
Locate the Citadel skull on the floor below the ceiling gap.
Check your Xbox 360 gamerscore and achievement statistics and you will see that the Citadel Skull achievement has been unlocked for 25 gamerscore.

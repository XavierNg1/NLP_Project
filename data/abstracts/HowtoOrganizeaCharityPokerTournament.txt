First, you need at least five people who know how to play poker.
Set the rules.
Spread the word.
Once everybody has registered and submitted their buy-in money, divide people up into groups.
When people arrive on the day of the tournament, give them their chips and start the games.
Eventually, there will be one table left with the best (or luckiest) players at it.
The last person standing gets the prize pot, but you might want to award some money to second and third-place finishers, too.
Clean up, thank the dealers, send off the money to the charitable organization, and you're done.

Decide what kind of absinthe you want to make.
Prepare your ingredients and the place where you'll be preparing the absinthe.
Add the ingredients and the alcohol to mason jars or similar glass vessels that can be sealed.

,
Store the bottle in a dark warm room for 2 weeks to 2 months to let the Artemisia absinthium and other herbs infuse adequately into the alcohol.
Take your mixture and strain all of the herbs from it with a cheesecloth, coffee filter, or similar material.
Use much less wormwood, preferable petite (to minimize bitterness).
It's easier to make a separate batch of "flavor absinthe" instead of putting the herbs directly into the distilled absinthe.
The mixing process is of utmost importance.
Bottle, and, since you probably don't know how to age it, enjoy.

Enjoy using your preferable absinthe ritual.

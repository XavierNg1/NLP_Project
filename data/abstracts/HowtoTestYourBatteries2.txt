Get a multimeter and theÂ battery you suspect is dead.
Turn the knob of the multimeter to "20" in the "DCV" or "V-" region (whichever your multimeter displays).
Put the red probe of the multimeter to the battery's positive terminal, and the black probe to the battery's negative terminal.
Check the readings.

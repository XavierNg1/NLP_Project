Locate an enemy vehicle to board.
Decide whether it is worth boarding.
Create a plan.
Gather what you will need to board the vehicle, whether it be teammates, equipment or weapons.
Know what will happen when you attempt to board the vehicle; some vehicles you only pull the driver off it, while other you can capture the vehicle for yourself and drive off in it.
Stay hidden from the enemy team and the vehicle in question.
Be patient!,
Wait for the perfect moment, be it the vehicle stopping or crashing into a wall or reversing.
Move!,
Board the vehicle by pressing and holding the Right Bumper when you are close enough.
Deal with the outcome of boarding - and the driver.
Drive off.
Have a Plan B - if it's too dangerous or difficult to board the ship safely, or if it looks like you may fail, you may just have to destroy the vehicle.

Select the wood you want to use for your wheelbarrow.
Build a simple, basic box suitable for your needs.
Rip two pieces of sound 2 inch (5cm) thick lumber on a taper from about 1 1/4 inches to 2 inches (3cm to 5cm) and around 4 feet (1.2 meters) long.
Lay these handles on a table, placing them at an angle that will allow the grip ends to be spread apart far enough for you to use them, and with the wide end almost touching.
Cut these two lines with a circular saw.
Build your wheel by gluing and screwing layers of 1 inch (2.5cm) thick boards together at opposite angles.
Scribe a circle on the blank you built for building the wheel.
Drill the handle frame and the center of the wheel to accommodate an all-thread rod.
Place a washer on the rod, then pass it through the wheel.
Install the handle/wheel assembly on the bottom of the box you built earlier.
Cut two wedges from 2 x 4 inch (5cm x 10cm) material, the same length as the box.
Lay your wheel and handle assembly on these wedges, and screw them in place.
Cut and install a cross brace between the wheelbarrow support legs to keep it from wobbling.
Sand edges smooth if desired, and seal or paint the wheelbarrow with an exterior coating.

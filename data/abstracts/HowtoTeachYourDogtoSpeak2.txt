Teach “quiet” after you teach “speak.” It’s much easier to teach “quiet” (or “enough” or “hush”) if your dog will bark when prompted.It’s often necessary, too.
Ask your dog to speak.
Say “quiet” and offer a treat.
Phase out the treat as you did when teaching “speak”.
Practice in more difficult circumstances.

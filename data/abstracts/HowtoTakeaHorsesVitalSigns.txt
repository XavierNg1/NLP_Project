Tie your horse in a safe suitable environment.
Know the normal vital signs:


The average normal temperature is 37-38ÂºC but this varies from horse to horse.
Use a thermometer.
Move the horse's tail to the side, so that it is out the way.
Leave the thermometer in position for at least three minutes or until it beeps.
Be aware that the pulse rate will increase if horse is excited, nervous, in pain, has a disease or during/after exercise.
Find the pulse.
Use your forefinger (never your thumb as you may feel your own pulse).
Use a clock or counter to time a 15 second period.
Watch or feel the horse's ribcage/belly for one minute.
Use a stethoscope, if possible.
Lift horse's upper lip.
Check for fast color return.

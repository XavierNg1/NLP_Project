Think of an interesting plot.
Begin with a hook.
Don't place all of your interesting plot material at the beginning.
Let your emotions show in your writing; lead with what you know.
Add sufficient detail to bring the story to life and to make the character seem truly real.
Reread your work now and then.
Keep writing.
Have your friends and family read the finished result.

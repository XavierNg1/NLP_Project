Walk to the end of the board, watch the water behind you (this is optional), and turn your back to the water.
Stand on the balls of your feet.

,
The first times you try this dive, start with your arms straight above your head and close to your ears.

,
Drop your arms to your sides while bending your knees.

,
At the same time, swing your arms back up to your ears and push off the board.
Once in the air, you have three options for your body position - tuck, where your knees are tucked tightly to your chest, pike, where your body is bent at the hips and forms an "L," and layout, where your body is completely straight.
Unless you are very comfortable with this dive, do not attempt to tuck or pike.
When you are completely vertical, (but upside-down over the water,) you're ready to twist.
You should now be facing forward.
Finished.

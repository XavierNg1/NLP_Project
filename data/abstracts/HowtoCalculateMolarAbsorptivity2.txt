Measure the intensity of transmitted light through varying concentrations of solution.
Plot the concentration versus absorbance on a graph.
Determine the slope of the line-of-best-fit through the data points.
Divide the slope of the line by the path length (depth of the cuvette) to calculate molar absorptivity.

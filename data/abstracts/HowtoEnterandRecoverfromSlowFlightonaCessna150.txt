Before entering slow flight the pilot needs to maintain the airplane in cruising speeds and keep the same altitude.Perform 1st clearing turn.
Perform pre-flight check list.Turn carb heat on.Progressively bring the throttle back to 1500-1700 RPM to decelerate slow flight speeds.
Once airspeed indicator is in white arc, move flaps to 10 degrees.
Perform second clearing turn.
Once wings are level move flaps to 30 degrees.
Add power to approximately 2000 RPM whenever getting close to 55 KIAS or as needed to keep altitude.
To perform power-off stall:

Lower nose as if looking at a runway for landing purposes.
To recover put the nose down (plane faces the ground) add full power.(Nose up) climb back to initial altitude at 70 KIAS.

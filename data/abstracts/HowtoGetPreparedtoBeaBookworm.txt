Take out a fresh notebook or calendar (any special one that you have in store at home/ buy one at Target, Walmart, Staples, etc.),
Make sure to write down at least 1 or more goals (whether it be mini goals or enormous ones) example: I want to ride a bike at least 2 times per week or I want to write a novel and leave at least 2 hours to write things about the book and do some research on it.
Start to get into the habit of going to the library and check out books.
Do online research too.
Read about the author and watch video interviews of the authors you admire.
If you feel up to it, you can even start fan fiction about your favorite characters.
Keep a dictionary handy.
Religiously collect new words/phrases, plot-points/ideas, character quirks that stick to you in the book.
If you have read so far and is thus serious about becoming a writer, never be ashamed to try out the classes in High School or College towards becoming an aspiring writer.

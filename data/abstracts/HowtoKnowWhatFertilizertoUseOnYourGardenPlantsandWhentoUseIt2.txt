Pay close attention to the numbers on the bag of fertilizer.
Choose a fertilizer with a slow burning release.
Go for a granular fertilizer for even coverage that gets the job done.Apply the granular fertilizer onto your lawn with a spreader to get the consistent coverage without the equipment pros are often equipped with.
Give the lawn its first feeding of fertilizer when the soil has warmed up.
Park your spreader in your driveway or on top of a tarp and fill it.

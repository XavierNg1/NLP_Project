Start off walking slowly on your toes, staff in your right hand, arms extended almost to the point where you look like youâ€™re asking for someone to throw something at you.
Come to a stop, arms still extended.
Take a large step forward with your right foot, bending your right leg.

,
Spin your body halfway around, facing the direction you walked from, straightening up.
Bring the staff back down, spinning it along the ground in a circle.
Bring the staff back out, and spread your arms wide as you had them in the beginning.

,
Hold this pose for a minute, then bring your staff back into both your hands, keeping the staff parallel to the ground.
Take a step like you are about to skip, and kick your right leg up in the air.
Bring the staff out and down, still in both hands, and then towards you, in a circular movement.
Bring the staff out and down again, finishing the circle in a crouch with your hands, still on the staff, on the ground.
Now, slowly start to stand up from your crouch.
When you reach the top, stop the staff, keeping it parallel to the ground.

,
Hold this for a moment.
Bring your staff in one final, sweeping oval around your body, spinning with it.

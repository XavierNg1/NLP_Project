Recognize that men and women are equal but separate and thus have separate roles.
Embrace your own femininity.
Don't try to "one up" your husband in your work or in something particularly masculine.
Don't be a brainless doll.
Build up his masculinity.
Tease him from time to time.
Don't talk badly about people EVER.
Never ever, EVER try to change him in any way.

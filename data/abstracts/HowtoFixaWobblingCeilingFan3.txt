Know that unbalanced blades cause most fan wobbling issues.
Purchase a blade balancing kit, or make your own.
Hook the balancing clip on the center of a blade, using the edge angled higher.
Slide the balancing clip up and down the blade, testing each time.
Attach a balancing weight at the location of the balancing clip, in the center of the blade.
Swap the blade positions if more than one blade is out of balance or if the fan is wobbling right after installation.

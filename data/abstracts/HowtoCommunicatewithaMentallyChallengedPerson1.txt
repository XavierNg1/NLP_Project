Don't assume that someone has an intellectual disability based on the ease of their speech.
Accept their quirks.
Recognize that ability varies from day to day.Stress, sensory overload, lack of sleep, how hard they pushed themselves this morning, and other factors can determine how easy it is for someone to communicate and perform other tasks.
Ask questions if you don't understand their wording.
If you don't know, ask.
Don't give up on them.
Find conversation topics that interest them.

Research the average climate and weather for your vacation spot during the month you are visiting.With the weather information you just found in mind, pull the clothes from your closet that are climate appropriate to your destination.
Get the smallest suitcase possible that will hold the clothes you have set aside and a few other small items.
Try to match up just enough outfits for number of days you are going on vacation, if less than a couple of weeks.
The easiest way to have a lot of options is to pack accessories.
Pack the clothes into the suitcase by rolling them.
Get together your toiletries and tuck them into the corners of the suitcase, or inside shoes.
Try not to over stuff, but if you find that you cannot fit everything you wanted, close the suitcase and stand it up overnight.
If all else fails, just pack as usual, then take half away.
If you are really finding it all to hard a relatively cheap vacuum packer might be helpful just put it in the bag and it sucks out all the air leaving it crease free.

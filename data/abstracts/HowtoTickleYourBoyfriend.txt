Determine if it's the right time and place.
Figure out if he's ticklish.
Make sure your nails aren't too sharp.
Sit next to your boyfriend on the couch, bed, or ground.
Slide your fingers under his arms and wiggle your fingers in his armpits.
Run your fingers up and down his sides.
Tickle the bottom of his feet while he's busy defending his upper body.
Finish by sweetly nuzzling his neck and alternating between giving him little kisses and blowing on the skin.
Don't tickle for too long and stop if it seems like he's really not enjoying himself.
Be prepared for retaliation.

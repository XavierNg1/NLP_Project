Don't disappear on someone after hooking up, especially the day after.
Remain friendly and considerate in public.
Spend time together outside of the bedroom.
Communicate your thoughts about the relationship.
Never use sex as a bargaining chip.
Don’t change who you are simply because you’ve had sex.

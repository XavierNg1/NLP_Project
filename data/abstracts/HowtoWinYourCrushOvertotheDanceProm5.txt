A week before the prom/dance, purchase a dress that both fits you and complements your body shape.
Shop for a pair of cute shoes if you need one.
About a few hours before the prom/dance, it's best to prepare so that you won't be late.
Pick out any accessories that match your dress, but beware of having too many.
Look up prom hairstyles and choose one that appeals to you.
Apply your makeup as needed.
Apply deodorant to make sure you smell good.
Slip into your shoes and pop on a jacket if needed, making sure not to mess up your hairstyle or wrinkle your dress.
Hold yourself in a tall position by throwing back your shoulders the slightest bit and sucking in your stomach a little.
Meet your crush and give him a friendly, "Hey.",
Don't be afraid to dance with your crush, but remember that you don't have to dance to every single song that is playing.
Smile naturally, as this is one of the important keys to unlocking your beauty.
If you're lucky, you two might kiss or become a couple.

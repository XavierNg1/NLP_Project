Go to the general area you want your fort.
Look around for big boulders, thick fallen trees, a stream, and/or open space.
Mark out the space you want your fort.
Gather long sticks that are 6 to 12 inches taller than as tall as you want your fort to be.
Make a hole in the ground as wide as your sticks and 5 to 12 inches deep around the edge of where you want your fort.
Insert the sticks into the holes and make sure they stay upright on their own.If the sticks do not stay upright, dig the holes deeper and make sure the thicker end is at the bottom.
Gather more sticks of any width.
Start the bottom of the upright sticks by the door.
Keep layering your sticks until you have created a solid wall all the way up.
Ok. You have your walls and frame.
Gather leaves, grass, sod, moss, or any plant that you can stuff into the frame.
Once you have your basic leaves and moss and grass shoved into the frame, consider covering weak parts of your insulation with mud.
If you do decide on mud, get a bucket like the kind you use to make sand castles at the beach or wash your car with.
Find a stick that spans across the door.
Find an old towel or something similar.
Dye the door to make it look more natural, if wished.
Every fort needs a roof.If you choose to continue, crisscross the sticks across the fort.
Then do the same with smaller sticks to the bigger ones.
Layer leaves, grass and moss on top of the sticks and continue with mud, as for the insulation.Done!

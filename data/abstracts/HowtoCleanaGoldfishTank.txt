Every week you will need to change about 25% (perhaps more depending on your water readings/types of fish you have) of the water in your tank.
Make sure you have some basic equipment.
Prepare the clean water that needs to go into the tank at the end.
Add the dechlorinator to the fresh water, stir it in and leave it to stand while you prepare the area (see step 3).
Don't overdo it.
If you are going to have to walk across a tiled or laminated surface consider investing in a rubber anti-slip mat.
Before you remove the old water, test your water for ammonia, nitrites, nitrate and PH.
Use a gravel vacuum to siphon water from the gravel of your tank.
Check your dirty water containers carefully to ensure that you haven't accidentally siphoned up a fish provided they're all clear you can empty them out in the garden - tank water is great plant food.

Pour the new water in very slowly so as not to disturb, frighten or shock the fish or the gravel and d√©cor.
Finished.

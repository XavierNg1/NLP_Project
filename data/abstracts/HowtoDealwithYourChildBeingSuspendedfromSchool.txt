If you don't get all the information you want at the first contact, don't be afraid to call back for further details.

Make sure each day still has a strong routine.
If the school has left school work for the child to do, make sure all of it is completed.
Punish your child when they get home.
Don't expect your child to talk about it right away.

Have your child come up with a different way they could have dealt with the situation.
Make sure your child understands why the behavior was wrong.

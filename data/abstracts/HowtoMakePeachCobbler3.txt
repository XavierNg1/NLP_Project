Wash, peel, and slice the peaches.
Put the sliced peaches into a large bowl, then stir in the sugar and salt.
Place the peach mixture into a skillet, and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Place the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the sugar and salt.
Cut the butter into the flour mixture.
Stir in the buttermilk until the dough just holds together.
Pat the dough into a disk, then use a glass or a 2Â½-inch (6.35-centimeter) biscuit cutter to cut out 8 to 12 biscuits.
Place the biscuits on top of the peaches.
Cover the cobbler with a tight-fitting lid, and cook it over medium heat for about 20 minutes.
Let the cobbler cool for 15 to 30 minutes before serving.

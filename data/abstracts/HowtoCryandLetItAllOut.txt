Forget what you learned about crying.
See the benefits of crying.
Figure out why you hold it all in.
Give yourself permission.
Find a good place to cry.
Clear your head of distractions.
Think deeply about what's making you sad.
Let your emotions swell until you cry.
Feel better.
Look at old pictures.
Watch a sad movie.
Listen to emotional music.
Write down your feelings.
Confide in a friend if you are comfortable with it.

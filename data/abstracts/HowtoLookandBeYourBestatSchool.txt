Look your best for school.
Stay away from salty and sugary food as much as you can.
Get in shape.
Shower everyday, but don't wash your hair everyday since this can remove the natural oil in your scalp, making your hair go dry.
Take care of your hair by trimming all of those split-ends every 3-6 months.
Cleanse your skin 2 times a day to keep your skin clean and under control.
Take care of your nails carefully by trimming them every week (or 2 weeks), file them to give it a shape (the best nail shape is "squoval" which means square nails with slight oval edges) and buff them to make them even and smooth.
Go for the natural look.
Be organized.
Always take notes in class.
Do your homework/assignments.
Study for your tests.
Finally, BE SOCIAL!,
HAVE FUN!

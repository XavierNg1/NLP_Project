Take the label off of a plastic bottle.
Rinse the bottle using soap and water.
Cut top part off the bottle with box cutter.Don't worry about being too exact; you will be trimming the bottle down shorter in the next step.
Use scissors to even out the top.Keep trimming until you get the height you want, and there are no jagged lines left.
Tear some tissue paper into small pieces.
Apply white school glue onto the bottle with a brush.
Stick the tissue papers on it.
Let the glue dry, and add a second layer if desired.
Decorate the bottle further using paint, markers, or stickers.
Finished.

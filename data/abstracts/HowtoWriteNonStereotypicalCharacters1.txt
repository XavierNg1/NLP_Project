Make a list of your favorite characters.
Figure out your main character’s “wants” and “needs.” You probably understand that the desires of your main character are what will drive the plot, but these desires will also shape the substance of your main character.
Determine your character’s “wounds.” All good characters have “wounds” they have incurred through their lives.
Try flipping an identity marker.
Look for “defining characteristics.” When crafting your characters, try to determine each character’s defining characteristics.

When planning an infiltration, it is important to know the area you will be "working" in.
Don't be ridiculous and infiltrate an area that is either against the law to infiltrate or will get you into serious trouble if you are caught.
Know the likelihood of being caught in your area.
Always wear clothing that is suitable to your particular environment.
If there are people in the target area, know their whereabouts at all times!,
Have some good footwear.
If you want, bring a friend.
If you are spotted, don't panic, this will only inhibit your thought process and you could make some bad choices.
If you are caught, just accept the fact and turn in.
Find some good Hiding spots: Roofs are very valuable, as no one will think to look up.
Learn how to move fluidly.
Don't ever bring a weapon unless it's necessary and is just an airsoft gun or small knife.
If climbing is necessary in order to reach your objective, wear weight-lifter's gloves.
If infiltrating during the day, use proper camouflage.
When inside of a building, constantly be alert.
Follow the law.

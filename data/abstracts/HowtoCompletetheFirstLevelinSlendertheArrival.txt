On starting the game you will see a cutscene.
As you get further down theÂ path it will get darker, and you will see a radio tower, a staple place in the story.
Now go into the house garden, and you will notice two playsets.
Now you have two things in your scrapbook- a missing poster and a note.
Now go inside.
After finding the torch, there are 5 scrapbook pieces downstairs to find.
After finding the key, head to the farthest room in the corridor and unlock it.
Head down the hill, picking up any scrapbook pieces you find.
There is a house at the end of the path.
Finally, walk up the hill/road until you reach a cabin.

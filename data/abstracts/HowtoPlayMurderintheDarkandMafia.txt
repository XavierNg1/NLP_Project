Get a deck of cards.
Depending on how many people you have, you will have to adjust the number of Mafia.
Once everyone has had a chance to look at their cards, hand them back to the narrator.
Have everyone put their heads down like their sleeping.
Wake everyone up.
After the person has either died or been saved, hold a trial session and have people make accusations against each other.Continue that process until either the Townspeople are all dead or members of the Mafia are dead.
Pass out the cards, the positions are the same as in Mafia.
When the narrator has all the cards back, turn out all the lights so its pitch black.How the mafia and Ninja kill people is by using your forefinger and slicing it across their throat and when the person is killed they can't say anything.
The townspeople's goal is to go around and try to find dead bodies.The narrator will then turn on the lights and everyone will gather around for the trial session.
The dead people will go sit down on a couch or something for the rest of the game.Continue the process until the Townspeople have won or the Mafia have won or the Ninja has won.

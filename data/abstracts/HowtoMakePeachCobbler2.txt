Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C).
Melt the butter in a 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 33.02-centimeter) baking dish.You can do this by cutting the butter into small cubes, placing them into the baking dish, and then leaving the dish in the oven as it heats up.
Combine the peaches, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large bowl.If you cannot find any canned peaches, you can use 3½ cups (790 grams) of fresh, peeled and sliced peaches instead.
Mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl.
Stir in the milk and the egg using a whisk.
Pour the batter evenly over the melted butter.
Pour the peach mixture over the batter, and do not stir.
Bake the cobbler for 35 to 45 minutes.
Let the cobbler cool for a few minutes, then serve it warm.

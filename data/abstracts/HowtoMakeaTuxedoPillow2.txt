Find an unwanted tuxedo shirt.
Use a disappearing ink pen and ruler to mark the square size of the front of your pillow on the front of the tuxedo shirt, plus one inch extra (2.5cm).
Cut out the square.
Stitch the sides of the two squares together, right sides facing, as for a normal pillow cover.
Turn the cover right side out.
Sew a bow tie to the front of the pillow for a final touch.

Consider the safety of the height.
Find a soft surface to jump down to.Whether you're jumping down for fun or in an emergency, the surface you're landing on will have a huge effect on the landing itself.
Wear shoes with shock absorption.
Try to relax.While it may seem counter-intuitive if you're getting ready for a big jump, it is important to relax a much as you can.
Lower yourself as much as possible.There may be unfortunate occasions where you need to land a high jump in an emergency and aren't doing it for athletic sport.
Get a friend to keep watch.A friend is good to have around because he can watch your jump and tell you how it looks.
Warm up before your jump.Squats and stretches should be done in the minutes before your jump.
Pinpoint the landing target.
Run through a mock-jump.
Jump towards your target.
Hold your form.
Spare room for flexibility.
Allow your body to go limp.
Land on both feet.In any type of jump, landing on one foot effectively doubles the amount of pressure on that foot.
Perfect a landing roll.
Do squats.Squats are a great go-to exercise.
Work plyometrics into your exercise routine.
Get enough sleep.Most people aim to get by with 5 or 6 hours per night.
Stay hydrated.Water is a necessary thing for the body to function, and you tend to need more of it when you're exercising.
Take your training slowly.If you're lucky enough to be jumping for fun rather than necessity, you should take advantage of the fact that you can learn at your own pace.
Keep practicing.Jumping can be a lot of fun.

Line your upper lashes with black eyeliner.
Apply a wingtip to the outer corner of your eye.
Apply white eyeliner pencil to your waterline, if desired.
Apply some black eyeliner to your lower lashes, but only a quarter of the way across.If you'd like, you can use an eyeshadow sponge applicator to smudge the eyeliner a little at the outer corner for a slight smokey effect; it will also help make your lashes appear fuller.
Brush on some volumizing and lengthening mascara.
Apply some false lashes.Although not absolutely necessary, false lashes are highly recommended; they will make your eyes appear larger and more photogenic.
Curl your lashes, if needed.

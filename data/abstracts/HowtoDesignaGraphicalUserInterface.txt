Remember the Golden Rule.
Forget everything you think you know about "Interface Design".
Find the perfect scalable layout/design.
Decide on the dimensions (final Size) and colour scheme (color swatches) for your design.

,
Choose your desired graphic design application (Photoshop, Fireworks, etc).

,
Create a "New Document" and save it as "your_file_name".
Create "layers" or "groups" named "work spaces".
Input the main "sections" that your design will have.
Dim/fade (change the opacity) of the Workspace Layout group.

,
Use the blocked out sections to begin laying out your "Website elements.",
Make sure that the "workspace layout" is at the very top of your layers.
At this point you can begin adding the web elements and content in any of the demarcated sections or "work spaces".

,
Add/design the content of all your sections, as well as the search box.

,
Keep working on content until you're happy with the layout.
Continue to add more and more detail to the sections.

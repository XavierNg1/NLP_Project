Focus on the person, not the sexuality.
Consume media about LGBT people.
Consider that many gay people want the same things in life that heterosexuals do: holding hands, kissing, making each other breakfast, and growing old together.
Don't associate gay people with promiscuous or immoral behavior.
Recognize that your religious beliefs cannot dictate what other people do.

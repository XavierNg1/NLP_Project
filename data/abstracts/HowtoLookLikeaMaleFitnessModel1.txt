Many men would like to look like the fitness models you see on TV and in the magazines.
To help you answer the first question, I gladly refer you to the following documentary "I wanna look like that guy".
As for the second question; You must realize that the guys with the rock hard bodies you see on TV and in the magazines have that body only for some period.
Once you know the truth about how to be that muscular, and you are still willing to go for it you may proceed.

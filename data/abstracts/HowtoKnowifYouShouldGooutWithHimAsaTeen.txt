Make a list of pros and cons about him.
This is probably the biggest one of all: Does he make you feel good about yourself?,
If you can be yourself around him and feel comfortable with being yourself, then you know you can start a real relationship.
You know he's right if he's patient with you.
Does he try to show you off to all his friends?,
If he lies to you or doesn't tell you something just to make you happy, he isn't stable enough.
Does he care about your appearance too much?,
Does he pressure you into doing stuff you don't want to?,
Is he willing to make changes for you?

Solution --- Join AB (Post.I.
With B as center, and BC as radius, describe the circle ECH (Post.
Produce DB to meet the circle ECH in E (Post.
With D as center, and DE as radius, describe the circle EFG (Post.
Realize that AF is equal to BC.

,
Demonstrate --- Because D is the center of circle EFG, DF is equal to DE (Def.
Because DAB is an equilateral triangle, know that DA is equal to DB (Def.
Hence AF is equal to BC.
It is usual with commentators on Euclid to say that he allows the use of the rule and compass.

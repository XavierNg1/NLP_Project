Identify the problem.
If your problem is that you don't know what should come next, it may help to sit down and write an outline of your story, from beginning to end.
If you are uninspired or bored with your own book, it could be that you are becoming too accustomed to your book.
If you are stuck for weeks on one part of the book because it doesn't sound professional enough for you, stop erasing.

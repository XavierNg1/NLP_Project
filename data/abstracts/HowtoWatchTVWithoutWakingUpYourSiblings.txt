Turn down the volume.
If your siblings fight you in your sleep, cooperate.
If your sibling snores or talks in their sleep, don't slap them in the face or tell them to shut up.
If they start to wake up and you might be embarrassed, abandon ship.
Once you're done, turn off the TV, clean up after yourself, and if it's not your room, leave or go find something else to do.

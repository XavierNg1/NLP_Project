Don't expect perfection from either yourself or the baby.
Make things easy for yourself by keeping supplies close to the places where you will be using them, such as diaper rash cream etc.
Sleep when the baby sleeps.
Ease into a schedule.
Be alert for signs of the postpartum blues especially if you have had a medicated, surgical or assisted delivery.
Accept help.
Carry the baby close to you in a baby carrier when you move around the house or when you go out.
Ease into a different diet.
Keep your social life balanced.
Know what to expect from the baby.
Plan for contraception before you resume love-making (only after you feel ready).
Remember to enjoy that baby.

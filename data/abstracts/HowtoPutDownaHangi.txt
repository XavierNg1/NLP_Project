Note traditional Hangi is prepared in the ground.
Prepare potatoes, kumara (sweet potato), carrots, onions, and other vegetables first.
Know that in the meantime others can dig a hole about knee deep and about two metres in diameter.
Remove the embers and unburnt wood when the stones/steel are red hot.

,
Have the vegetables ready to go in wire baskets (chicken wire is good.

,
The meat should be ready to go also.
Essentially the cooking is a steaming process with some direct heat from the stones on the lower layers of food.

,
Cover the baskets with nice white and clean cotton cloth (sheets or old table cloths - but make sure they are clean) which are completely wet.
Learn that when the time to open the Hangi has arrived you will need a number of people with shovels to carefully remove the layer of earth.
Carry the baskets to tables and serve it up to the old people first after someone has said grace.

,
Eat up.

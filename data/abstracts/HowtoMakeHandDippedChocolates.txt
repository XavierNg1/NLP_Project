Prepare your workspace by placing waxed or parchment paper on the top of your baking sheet.
Break chocolate bars into 1-inch squares or use chocolate chips.
If desired, make a chocolate candy center called a ganache by pouring the melted chocolate into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap.
Stick a skewer firmly in the middle of the food and dip into the chocolate, or if using pretzels, crackers or other like items, carefully hand dip.
Place the dipped chocolate onto the lined baking sheet.
Finished.

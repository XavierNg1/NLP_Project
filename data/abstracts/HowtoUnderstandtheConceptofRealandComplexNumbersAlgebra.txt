Study the Real numbers also called the set of "R = Reals".

,
Build understanding of the system of Reals by knowing the following subsets of the set of rational numbers, including:


Naturals, N = {1, 2, 3,...}, (the counting numbers)






Wholes, W = {0, 1, 2, 3,...}, (Naturals and zero)






Integers, P = {... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,...}






Common Fractions, p/q which means the quotient of p divided by q, where q is not zero, p and q are natural numbers (quotient - the solution of a division).
Draw a line (called a bar) "above the part of the number that repeats" in a repeating decimal: this is when handwriting, to indicate the repeating part of that rational number.

,
Study "Irrational" numbers.
Learn that the Real numbers are all of the above: made up of the rationals and the irrationals, and does not include the imaginary numbers.

,
Study the imaginary numbers.
Consider this rule: Even roots of negative real numbers are imaginary.
Consider another rule: Odd roots of negative reals are negative Reals.
Define the complex numbers are of form y = ax + bi.
Define Reals are a subset of the set of complex numbers.

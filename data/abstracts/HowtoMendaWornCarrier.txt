With a simple sewing machine, plan to make a three sectional carrier.
Remove your worn out carrier, from the waistband, with a medium or small sized seam ripper.
Sew the worn carrier on the polyester fabric.Fold the left section, at the dotted line and iron it.Zig zag, or make a double seam, just inside of where you will trim in step 7.
Fold the right section behind the middle section and iron it.
Cut off the excess fabric off of the right section and baste the right section to the other two sections.
Sew two seams and this will bind the three sections together.
Mount the carrier on the pants.

Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C), and prepare your baking dish.
Prepare the bread.
Place the bread slices, buttered-side-up, on the bottom of your baking dish.
Sprinkle the top of the bread with raisins.
Combine the milk, heavy cream, salt, and vanilla in a large saucepan.
Bring the mixture to a boil over medium to high heat, then remove from the stove promptly.
Beat the eggs and sugar together in a large bowl until the eggs turn pale yellow.
Slowly whisk 1 cup (240 milliliters) of the boiled milk mixture into the egg mixture.
Slowly whisk in the rest of the milk mixture into the egg mixture, then strain the custard base.
Pour the custard base into the baking dish.
Place the baking dish into a larger roasting pan, and fill it with about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of water.
Bake the pudding for 60 minutes.
Let the pudding cool on a wire rack.
Consider making a tasty sauce for the pudding.
Take the pudding out of the roasting pan, and dust it with confectioner's sugar before serving it.

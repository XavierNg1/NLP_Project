Consider using the bass in conjunction with the bass drum.
If you are playing the bass over the progression, have it repeat every, for example, 4 bars, and then have a change on the 13th-16th BAR (not to be confused with the (16ths of a Bar under drums above).
Make it into a full piece by repeating the whole above process and make several different sections of the tune that you will fit together (following the 16/32/64 pattern above).
Bring the whole tune together.

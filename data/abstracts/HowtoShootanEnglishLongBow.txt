Take arrow and lock it on string with the cock (odd colored feather) facing away from the bow.
Bend your arm at the elbow (wear an armguard of hardened leather) so that the string doesn't get under the armguard and bite you.
Once the arrow is locked on the string, hold the string with your index, middle, and ring fingers, with the arrow between your index and middle.
Hold your bow firm and pull back with your fingers.
Focus your attention on the smallest spot you can find on your target and let nothing else distract you.
Relax the fingers of your right hand to let the string slip past them.
Hold your stance until the arrow hits the target.

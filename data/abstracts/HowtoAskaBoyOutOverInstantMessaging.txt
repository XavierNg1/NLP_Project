Only use this option as a last resort.
Make sure you have been Messaging with this person for awhile.
Look at his reactions.
Give him a hint you're about to ask him out.
If he says something like "Thanks" or "You're nice too.",
Of course if you are a bit nervous or embarrassed to ask him out, say to another friend that is online "can you do me a favour?",
If he/she says no, DON'T freak out, it just isn't meant to be.
If he/she says yes you should make sure that you are allowed to go out.

Purchase rice seeds from any gardening or farmers supply store.
Choose your planting location.
Gather at least 1 to 2 ounces (28.5 to 56.5 g) of rice seeds to sow.
Plant the rice seeds throughout the soil, during the fall or spring season.
Fill the buckets or the garden space with at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water.
Observe the water levels of the planting area, keeping the soil constantly wet.
Thin, or space out, the rice seeds to prevent crowding.
Wait for the rice grains to mature.
Cut the stalks and let them dry.
Bake them at 180°F (82°C) for an hour.
Separate the kernels from the hulls.

Reflect on whether it was a true lie.
Does the other person acknowledge he or she lied?,
Is the other person willing to talk about it?,
Why the lie?,
Is the other person sorry?,
Is he or she willing to make amends?,
Everyone lies.
Forgiving means "moving on".
Take a leap of faith and trust again.
Do not confuse forgiveness for trust.
Forgiving without a person apologizing.
Reflect on whether you are too quick to forgive, or too slow to let go of a grudge.

Get out the word and set the rules.
Post your rules first.
Make sure everyone knows before putting up the form for submitting characters is that if their character gets eliminated from the Selection, or dies (read: Southern Rebels), that is entirely under your control.
Post the form for entering the Selection.
Remember you only need 35 girls from 16 to 20.
Start figuring out what these characters are going to do, who'll be sent home, and so on.
Be mindful of people's feelings.
Make sure it doesn't take 50 chapters to narrow down to the Elite.

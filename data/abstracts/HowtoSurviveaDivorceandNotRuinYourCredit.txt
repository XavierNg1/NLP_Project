Close joint accounts before you separate or divorce to prevent your former spouse from running up charges and leaving you responsible for the balance.
Establish separate accounts, such as credit cards, gas cards and retail cards.
Arrange new individual lines of credit with the same lenders to replace each joint account and transfer agreed upon balances to those new accounts.
Some creditors will require you to pay off the account before they put it in an individual name.
It may be wise to have an attorney involved if creditors refuse to cooperate with you.
Try settling the account with the creditor directly by paying a smaller amount than what is owed.
Pay the jointly held bills yourself--then go after your spouse for the money owed.

Open the image that you want to change in the image editor of your choice and select the cloning tool (in Adobe Photoshop it is a rubber stamp icon).
Zoom into the image to between 200 and 300%, focusing on the part where you want to clone your pixels to.
Start cloning in easier areas, such as in sky or on very smooth or dark textures, first.
Do not rush while working.

Go to your local pet sore, and find 'chinchilla sand'.
Get a small bowl to put the sand in.
After putting the sand in it (Don't put too much in, just enough for them to be able to roll in it), leave it in your gerbil's cage.
Take it out about 10 minutes later, because the gerbils may go to the toilet in it.

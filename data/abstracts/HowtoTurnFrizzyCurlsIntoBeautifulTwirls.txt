Wash your hair 2-3 times a week.
After washing out your conditioner, comb through your hair with a wide tooth comb.
When drying, don't rub your hair vigorously with your towel, or it will frizz up.
Always follow up with a high quality leave-in conditioner.
Finish with an non-sticky styling lotion like Bumble & Bumble curl cr√®me or Bedhead Curls Rock.
Tilting your head to one side, smooth the product into your hair, in sections.
Let your hair air dry, and DO NOT TOUCH IT while it is drying, or after it dries.
Once it has dried, you may want to put it in a clip, a mini-ponytail, or the like.

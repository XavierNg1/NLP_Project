If you like planning, then plan how you'll spend the day at least a week ahead.
Get plenty of sleep.
Treat yourself to an awesome birthday outfit.
Decorate your own room if you'd like.
Plan an awesome party.
Remind your family that it's your birthday.
Have breakfast in bed.
Have the best birthday ever by starting out with a luxurious bath.
Throw that awesome party you'd planned.
Go out and have fun with your friends.
Go out to lunch with your friends.
Have dinner with your family.
Be thankful to be alive!

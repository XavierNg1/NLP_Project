In school, try not to get into trouble.
If allowed, get yearbooks signed and sign yearbooks.
Remember, the main focus of this day is to clear off all the stress of the next day.
Get the rest of your things.
Organize all of your school things and the stuff you plan to bring on the last day of school.
Take a breather and relax!,
Reflect on the school year that is about to end.
Buy gifts for your teachers if choose to.
Enjoy your last day in this grade level.

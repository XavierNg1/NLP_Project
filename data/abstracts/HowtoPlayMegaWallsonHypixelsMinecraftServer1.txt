Cut through the wheat field (you'll want a lot of bread when you're invading enemy forts later).
Start mining iron.
Craft a furnace (and a chest, if you didn't find one while mining) and start smelting the iron.
Once you have 26 iron ingots smelted, craft some armor and a sword.
Put on the armor, craft bread from the wheat you got in the fields, place spare resources in your hidden chest, and wait for the walls to fall.

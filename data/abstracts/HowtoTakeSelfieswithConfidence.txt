Think about it.
Start to accept your facial features.
Wear cute clothes.
Tell yourself that you're beautiful, and instead of concentrating on your flaws, think about one positive feature other people don't have.
Filter your selfie!,
Use lighting techniques.
Stay away from Photoshop!,
Take selfies in different places, like the beach and the city.
Tell yourself that there are lots of people uglier than you.
Remind yourself that when you post your selfie, you will get likes and comments.

Make a base block.
Get a 2 by 4 approximately 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m) long.
Now, attach two 6" diameter wheels that do not swivel to the underside of the piece.
Use two 4 by 4 inch blocks of wood about 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) long to attach to the 2 by 4 you already put on the board.
Put a 2 by 4 about 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) long along the tops of the 4 by 4 blocks.
Now for the barrel.
Do not attach the barrel with screws or nails.
Build a chickenplate.
Get some "shells.",
Personalize it.
If and only if you live in states that allow them, you can use bottle rockets, put them in the bottles, have a buddy light them, and shove them in the breach.

Bake a cake.
If necessary, "level" your cake.
Make icing.
Take about 2/3 of the icing and put in a mixing bowl.
Using your green icing, apply a thin "crumb" coat to your cake.
Once it's coated, put the entire cake in the refrigerator for two hours to let your crumb coat harden.

,
Pull your cake out of the refrigerator and apply a nice coat of your green icing all around, starting with the top.
For the creeper's face, draw (or better yet, get off the internet) the face of a creeper onto a piece of paper.
Get an icing bag and fit it with a thin or round (drawing) tip.
Replace the round tip with a star tip.
Enjoy!

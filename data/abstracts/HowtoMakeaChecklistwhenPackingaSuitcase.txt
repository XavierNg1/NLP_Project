Write down the absolute necessities first!,
When planning your absolute necessities, make sure to plan ahead.
Try to visualize how much room your necessities will take up in your suitcase.
Now you can plan your luxuries.
If you can, once again, make sure everything fits.

After the trip, write down what you wish you'd have brought and what you didn't need (or brought too much of).

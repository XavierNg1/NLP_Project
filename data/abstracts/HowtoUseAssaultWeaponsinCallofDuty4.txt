Start out by using the default assault class until you reach level 4.
For a second class, use an AK-47 with the same perks as the M-16 class.
Once you unlock the M4 Carbine make a class with stopping power and steady aim.
The G3 and M14 would be used more like an M-16 on big maps but if you put steady aim on them they become more like No-Scope weapons.
The G36c is a very good gun due to its lack of recoil.
The MP44 is pretty much a degraded AK-47.

If you have a YouTube account, make a second one, or make two more.
Find a video to talk to yourself on.
On one of your two accounts, say something that would likely go against the opinions of the people who are watching the video.
Log out of your account and log into your second account, go back to the video, and change character - then reply to the comment you left with your first account with an opposing message, like "You idiot, this film looks bloody awesome.",
Switch characters and accounts back and forth to pretend to have an argument over it!,
As more people get involved, you might notice other people starting to have a bit of a row with each other.
If you want to make this joke even more diverse, make another account and throw in a third character.
The funny thing is, nobody will know it's one person.
If you want to, you can have your two account characters "make up".
Once you've had enough, just abandon the video.

Set up the formula for the surface area of the cone.
Plug the value of the radius into the formula.
Plug the value of the slant height into the formula.
Calculate the lateral surface area of the cone ((π)(r)(s){\displaystyle (\pi )(r)(s)}).
Calculate the area of the cone’s base ((π)(r2){\displaystyle (\pi )(r^{2})}).
Add the lateral surface area and the base area of the cone.

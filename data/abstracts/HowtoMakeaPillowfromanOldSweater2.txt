Cut the sweater down until it is a little larger than the pillow form.
Pin and sew all four edges together using a Â½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.Take the pillow off the sweater and put it aside.
Unbutton the sweater from the inside, then turn it inside out.
Insert the pillow form, then button the sweater back up.If you want, you can glue or hand sew the front closure shut.

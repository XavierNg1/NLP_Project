Use a soft cloth tape measure to measure the length around your torso, just beneath your breasts.
Add five inches (12.5cm) to this measurement, rounding up to the nearest even whole number.
Use your tape measure to measure around the widest part of your chest.
Take the difference between your band size and your bust size to find your cup size.
When trying on a bra, place your hands through the straps and bend over at the waist, so that your breasts fall into the cups.
Adjust both the hooks and strap size of the bra to achieve a comfortable fit when trying on a bra.
Check the bridge of the bra.

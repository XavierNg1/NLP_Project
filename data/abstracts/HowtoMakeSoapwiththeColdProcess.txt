Gather all the necessary materials.
Fill the glass measuring bowl with the appropriate amount of distilled water, based on the recipe.
Add the appropriate amount of lye very slowly to create the lye/water solution and stir.
Set the lye/water solution safely off to the side so that it may cool a bit.

,
Weigh the oils and melt them in the stainless steel pot using the stove on medium heat.

,
When the lye/water solution and oils have reached the same temperature, ideally around 110 °F (43 °C), stir the lye/water solution slowly in to the stainless steel pot of melted oils to create the soap mixture.
Stir the soap mixture thoroughly.
Once the soap mixture reaches "trace", add the essential oils, other fragrances or herbs, pigments and stir.
Pour the soap mixture into the molds.
Stash the molds in a warm place and allow them to cure and harden for 24-48 hours.
After the soap has hardened, its water content will still be quite high.

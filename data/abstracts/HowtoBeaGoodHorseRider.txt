Stand at the horse's near side (their left), and put your left foot in the stirrup.
Make sure your stirrups are even and the right size.
Now it's time to walk on.
When your horse is warmed up, you can trot on!,
When you want to canter, put your outside leg back and squeeze and make a kissing sound.
Try to understand your horse.
Take time to 'bond' with the horse you are riding.
Be gentle.

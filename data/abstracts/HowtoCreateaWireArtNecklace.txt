Prepare the wire you will use.
Cut the wire into 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) pieces.
Twist each 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) strip into little figure 8's, or think of a "S" but keep in mind each end must be closed against the inside of the "S".
Make your own "O"-shaped rings by coiling the wire around a thin rod or the tip of your pliers.
Interlock your handmade "S" links by placing an "O" between them.
Attach a clasp of your choice.
Find the center of the chain, opposite the clasp, and attach any pendant you wish.

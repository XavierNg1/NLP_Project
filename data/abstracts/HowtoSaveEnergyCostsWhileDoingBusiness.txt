Consider the energy requirements when buying vehicles or other office equipment.
Ask your staff to use heating/cooling systems at moderate levels (room temperature set at some point within 70 â€“ 78 is perfectly normal).
Before implementing these energy-saving steps, call for a meeting and share the advantages of energy saving with your staff.

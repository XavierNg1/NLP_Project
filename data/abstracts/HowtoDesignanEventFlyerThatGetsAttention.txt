Visit a spot where there are lots of flyers.
Use the largest paper format that your printer can handle or the biggest enlargement you can afford from a print shop.
Use brightly colored paper.
Choose a striking picture.
Use simple, thick fonts.
Avoid clutter.
Make sure the flyer can be seen from a distance.
Post your flyers early, at least one week before your event.
Plan any big events a month or 2 before you start handing out flyers to make sure that everything is planned.

Boil some water in a small saucepan.
Stir some salt to the boiling water and let it dissolve.
Pour the water into a small saucer or dish.
Wait until the water evaporates and crystals form.
Pick out a crystal.
Tie a piece of thread to the crystal.
Fill a jar with more salt water, and let the water cool.
Place the pencil over the mouth of the jar, and slowly lower the crystal into the water.
Place the jar someplace where it won't get disturbed, and wait.
Use the crystal.

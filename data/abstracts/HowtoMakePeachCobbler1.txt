Peel, pit, and slice the peaches.
Put the peaches into a large bowl, then stir in the white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice, and cornstarch.
Transfer the peach mixture into a 2-quart (2-liter) baking dish, and bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.If you want, you can grease the inside of the baking dish with some butter or cooking spray first; this will prevent the cobbler from sticking.
Combine the flour, white sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl.
Cut the butter into the flour mixture until you get a coarse mixture.
Pour in the water, and stir it with a whisk until it is just combined.
Spoon the batter over the peaches.
Make some cinnamon sugar to sprinkle on top.
Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar evenly over the cobbler.
Bake the cobbler for about 30 minutes.
Let the cobbler cool for a few minutes, then serve warm.

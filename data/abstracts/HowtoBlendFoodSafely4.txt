Do not blend hot liquid.
Transfer the slightly cooled hot liquid to the blender.
Lift up one corner of the blender's lid.Unlike with food, it is not a good idea to remove the feeder cap when blender hot liquids.
Put a clean, folded tea towel or small hand towel over the lid.Hold in place gently (so as to not close the slightly ajar lid) and blend on the lowest level possible.

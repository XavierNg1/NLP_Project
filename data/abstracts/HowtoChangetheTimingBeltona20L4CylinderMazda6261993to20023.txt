Barely loosen (break loose) each of the 11 bolts (10mm) connecting the Overhead Cam (OHC) valve cover to the engine.
Remove the OHC valve cover.
Align the timing marks on back of the cam sprockets lined up straight across.
Check that the cylinder one is at Top Dead Center (TDC) on the compression stroke.
Required: securely place a "rubber" stop-block (you may use a rubber stopper from a wine bottle but not made of real cork which will crumble) to put it in place to jam the cam sprockets.
Loosen the front wheel lug nuts on the right-hand side of the car, but leave them snug (the same side the engine belts and pulleys are on).

,
Jack up the that side and use a jack-stand to support the car (place jack and stand on strong concrete or stone base).
Keep in mind that later you will need to support the engine with a jack; so you may need an additional jack.

,
Remove the plastic splash-guard cover under the engine which extends to cover the side of the wheel well.
Support the engine securely with a scissor or bottle jack exerting only a little upward pressure with a strong piece of wood (longer than a brick) to protect the engine from the jack.
Remove the plastic top half timing cover by loosening 4 small bolts (10mm) near each corner.
Remove the harmonic pulley bolt (21mm) that you loosened earlier and remove the pulley.
Put the bolt back in to hold the sprocket on and ensure the sprocket key is always kept in its slot.
Remove the retaining screws from the lower half timing cover (10mm).
Remove the lower timing cover carefully - you have to maneuver it to clear the alignment pin-block (shaped like a small 2mm cube) just above the crankshaft sprocket that fits into place in the lower half cover.

Do not tell anyone whether or not you "like" someone.
You may tell one trusted friend as a best friend which may help a little however don't make it a huge rumor as it will spread to your crush in an instant and cause huge drama within your school, easily breaking friendships and making it hard to focus on what's really important.
Avoid wearing too much makeup, or wear sleazy clothing (heels, super tight jeans, low cut tops, short skirts, spaghetti straps or tees with rude or sleazy sayings on them, etc.).
You will notice that at new schools, other girls will give you "the look".
If anyone ever says to you, "Hey, Jane, can I talk to you in private?",
Be nice to everyone!,
Do not lie to anyone about anything, because if you get called out on more than 2 or 3 lies, people will start to see you as a liar and no one will trust you.
Do not talk about anyone behind their back, it will catch up to you.
Always go to the person who is saying something about you or someone you care about before you get mad and start things that don't need to be started.

,
If anyone starts to argue, and you're not the type of person to choose sides, just stand and listen!,
Don't get involved in other people's dramas.
If your friends fight, be diplomatic.
If you fall out with a friend, don't run around telling everyone.
Popularity isn't everything.
If someone has offended you, ignore it.
You may find that you have a friend who cannot help getting into arguments.

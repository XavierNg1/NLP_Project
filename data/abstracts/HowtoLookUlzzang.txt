The makeup.
For the face, use a bright BB cream (CC creams and the new DD creams may also work) and/or foundation (liquid or powder form) to cover blemishes, dark spots, etc.
Next is eyes, which is the most important part.
Mouth should be small (not thin, but small) and somewhat pouting, but there isn't a need for makeup here.
Now for the hair.
There are really no particular guidelines for clothing.

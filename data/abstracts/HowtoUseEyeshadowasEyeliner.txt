Use an angled eyeliner brush.
Be sure that the brush you are using is clean, to avoid color transfer from the last time you used the brush.
Prepare your eye with a primer or a lotion.
Gently dampen both sides of the brush in water.
Lightly tap the brush into the eyeshadow.
Close one eye to start applying the eyeshadow.
Release your eyelid and keep your eye closed.

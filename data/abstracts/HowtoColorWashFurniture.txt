Choose a paint in the desired color.
Pour one part paint into a large container.
Add nine parts water and stir well.
Combine the wash with other paints to incorporate different shades.
Start with a plain, unsealed surface.
Brush on the first coat of wash. Dip a soft-bristled paintbrush into the wash you mixed up, then glide it over the surface of the piece youâ€™re painting.
Repeat with additional coats.
Wipe down the wet wash for a distressed effect.
Allow the piece to dry overnight.
Sand the washed piece lightly.
Apply a final clear coat.

Start with your squirrels and a good sharp knife or two, as well as a bucket, jug, or pan with water to put the cleaned squirrels in.
Put your squirrels in a bucket of water to wet them down and let them soak a little.
Pull a squirrel out of your bucket and hold it by the tail, with the belly away from you.
Put the squirrel’s tail down on a hard surface and step on it.
Pull until the skin gets up to around the front legs / shoulders.

,
Work your fingers up around each front leg (the front) to separate the skin from the meat.
Take your hands and break the bones in the front legs (like breaking a stick).
Now to start to work on the back half.
Grab the legs and break them, as before with the front.
To start gutting the critter, turn the squirrel over with the belly toward you, with the back legs up.
Once you get down to the pelvic bone, put the tip of your knife in under the pelvic bone and pull up to split the bone.
Now, flip the squirrel over and grab a front leg.
Once the front legs are cut off, plop them into your bucket, pan, jug, whatever you’ve got to put the meat into.
Once you’ve got that done, grab and twist to separate the rib cage and guts from the rest of the carcass.
Now, make a cut on either side of the back legs, above the hip bones (you’ll see the hip bones sticking out a little).

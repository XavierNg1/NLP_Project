Don't second-guess yourself.
Accept that some people do act out of the kindness of their hearts.
Be selective about who you ask for help.
Understand the natural dynamic of give and take.
Learn to trust others.
Beware of undermining your problems.It can be all too easy to dismiss the worth or depth of your own problems.There is no hierarchy of problems, or scale of emotional pain.
Let go of the problems that no one can fix.There lies the greatest strength of all as there is a big difference between "burying" problems in comparison to accepting, forgiving and letting them go.

Find a willing portrait model.
Set up your pad somewhere stable, either clip it to a slightly larger drawing board or put it on an easel.
Turn your pad so it reflects the orientation of the subject.
Look at your pad of paper for the last time before you start your drawing.
Decide where you're going to begin your drawing, size up the pose mentally (try to imagine where the edges of the paper would appear around the figure) and put your pen down on your paper in a place where you think corresponds to how you see the figure.
From that point, begin to trace a contour (line) in a given direction, both with your eye and the pen.
If you've drawn yourself into a "corner" and want to be drawing at another part of the picture, you can risk picking up your pen and guessing where the new contour would start.
When the time has run out, tell the model to relax and stretch, while you can look at your drawing.

Give chicks their first vaccinations at the right time.
Do not give vaccines to chickens who are laying eggs.The risk of the virus being shed via the oviduct into the egg, and then taken off site where it could pose an infection risk to other birds, is too high when you vaccinate chickens while they are laying eggs.
Be aware of which vaccines need to be given annually.
Check the overall health of your chickens before you vaccinate.
Check and record the vaccination information.
Double check that the vaccine has been stored correctly.
Gather all of your materials.
Sterilize the spot where you plan to inject the vaccination.

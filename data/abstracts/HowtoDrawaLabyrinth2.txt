Draw eight concentric circles, leaving a small circle that will serve as the labyrinth's center.
At the labyrinth's center, draw a flower-like pattern.
Draw two horizontal lines and four vertical lines across the labyrinth, taking care to avoid drawing through the center.
Erase lines to make labyrinth pathways.
Erase the vertical line in the first circle, and leave the rest of them untouched.
Erase the horizontal line in circle 7, but leave the rest of them untouched.
Erase the first vertical line from the left within circles 3, 4, and 7.
Continue to erase lines within each circle to complete the pathways.

First you need to shut off the breaker to the pump.
Locate and remove the top of the well head (cap).
Shine a bright flashlight into the well head.
Now that we know how to approach this removal, we can gather the tools we need.
Screw the "T" tool into the top of the pitless adapter and disconnect the electrical connections.
When you are ready, someone pulls up on the small cable that is the pitless adapter lock, and another person pulls up on the "T" tool.
Now that the "T" tool has been removed, you can start pulling the flex pipe up.
Once the well pump is out, you can start removing the old pump.
When connecting a new pump, make sure that you have someone electrically knowledgeable or an electrical contractor make the connections.
Now you are ready to install your new pump.
Just like removal, use 2 people at the well head, and another person to walk the flex pipe towards the well head.
Once you get to the pitless adapter, you will need to install your "T" tool once again.
When the pitless adapter is secured, you will have not weight on the "T" tool, and it can be removed.
Now you can reconnect the electrical connections at the top of the well, and again, if you don't feel comfortable doing this, consult an expert.

Before installing the cap, it is best to check to see if you have water.
Install the well cap and you are done.

,
Your water should now be checked for bacteria and for "softness" by a certified water company since there is always a chance for bacteria to enter you water system.

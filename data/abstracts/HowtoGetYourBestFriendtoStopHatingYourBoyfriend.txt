Introduce them to each other, and tell them that its really important to you that they both get on.
Try talking to them separately.
Tackle any specific or particular issues right away.
Consider what your friend has to say.
Consider your options if there's no other way.

Be nice.
If your best friend completely understands that you love your boyfriend and when they are mean to your boyfriend they hurt you too, it is time to get a new best friend.

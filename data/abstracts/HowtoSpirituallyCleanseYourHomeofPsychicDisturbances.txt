Before starting the spiritual cleansing process, there are several important steps that must not be skipped:


Thoroughly clean out the junk and unnecessary items from your house (physically).
Gather the things you'll need.

,
Gently pour the water into the salt, adding a prayer or invocation.
Take the water and either using your fingers or a little brush, sprinkle the holy water around the walls of every room every door and every window.
Pour the remaining salt/water mixture in a line in front of any doors leading in and out of the building.
Go back into the house, and in each room light a small white candle and some incense.
Put a bunch of fresh flowers into the main room of the house.

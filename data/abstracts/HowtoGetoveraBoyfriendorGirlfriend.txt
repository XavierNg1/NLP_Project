Learn to come out from it all the better person, stronger, experienced and that you've learned from your mistakes.
Don't rush through getting over that person too quickly.
Take a couple of days and think about what has happened, how it lead to the end and how you could have handled things better.
Make sure you understand why you two broke up and why that crush could never be a reality, its important to reflect and understand.

Next, delete any traces of that person.
Don't dwell on things.
Try different things.
Get your confidence back!,
Get into the habit of writing all your feeling down, or maybe express in painting?,
Get a new image!,
Don't feel too sorry for yourself.
S-M-I-L-E. Show people that you are happy and smiling is the easiest thing you can do to make people notice you.

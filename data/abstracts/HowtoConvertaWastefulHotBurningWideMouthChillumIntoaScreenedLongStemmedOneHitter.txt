Select a socket-wrench piece fat enough to exactly match the inner diameter of the chillum bowl if cylindrical, otherwise drill a cylindrical opening matching the exterior diameter of the fat part of the socket wrench piece you have selected.

Preshape the screen: With a 3/16"-diam.
Position a metal-ring screen-support (or failing that, a hand-made ring of tinfoil) in quarter-inch hole (crater) of socket wrench piece, leaving 3/16" (5-mm.),
Tap socket wrench piece carefully down into the mouth of the chillum so that the fat part fits tightly, about flush with the top of the chillum, and the narrow part, containing the screened crater, juts out about a centimeter (7/16 inch).
Two methods of adding a long drawtube are shown in the diagram: a.
Semi-vaporizer technique: the object is to insert 25-mg. (1/40 gram) of pre-sifted herb or shredded tobacco product, etc. into the crater-- rather than light up a whole 700-mg conventional cigarette, which instead breaks down into 28 separate pinch-servings, usable any time and place.
Don't be in too great a hurry to get it started burning; desired ingredient (the nicotine, cannabinol, thymol or whatever) will vaporize out at temperatures just under 400 F.; once any part of the herb is dry enough to start burning, its function is to heat neighboring particles of the herb from which the ingredient is still vaporizing.
As few smokers appear to be aware, herbal ashes, even those of tobacco, are non-toxic to eat and contain a minor amount of nourishing minerals which are readily digestible.

Plan your meals.
Double your usual water intake the day before a race.
Stay off of your feet as much as possible the day before you race.You want to meet the start line with every part of your body feeling refreshed and well-rested.
Eat complex carbohydrates throughout the day.Grazing on small quantities of complex carbohydratesthroughout the day the day before a race can help you establish the fuel you will need for race-day energy.However, you shouldn’t overload on carbs or attend an all-you-can-eat spaghetti dinner the night before the race.
Sleep well the night before the race.You should really be sure that you have slept well the whole week of the race; the sleep you get the night before may be less important than the sleep you have “banked” from the rest of the week.

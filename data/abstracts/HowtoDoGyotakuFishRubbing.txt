This is a great project to do after a fishing trip with your children.
Before beginning, prepare your work area and gather the needed supplies.
Procure your subject!,
Prepare the fish for painting.
Be sure the fish is dead before you beginning.

,
Wash and dry the fish to get all the slime off.

,
Using straight pins, position the fish so it looks good to you, being certain to wipe off any blood which may ooze out around the pins, off of the fish.
Paint the fish with the paint, being certain to paint in the direction of the scales, not against the grain of the fish.
Highlight the belly of the fish with a light color (white or yellow) and paint the fins a little bit darker than you paint the body.
Beginning in the center, press the rice paper down on the fish, and try your best to press the rest of the paper outward from the center, trying not to get creases in it.
Remove the paper once you are done pressing the entire fish, and lay your print flat.

,
Using a small paint brush, paint the eye onto your fish, and enhance the fins if necessary.

,
Be sure to sign your creation!,
Hang your print it to dry in your previously chosen, and hopefully per-setup location.

,
Using soap and water, wash the foam board you used to pin your fish to when you began the project.
Once your print is dry, attach it along the top edge of the foam board using a glue-stick, or some other water based paint.
Go back and thoroughly clean your work area, and put away your supplies.
Frame your creation!

Remove the head from the tripod.
Notice that the rubber cap is holding an Allen wrench (it should anyway).

Separate a length of aluminum tube and the head.

Remove the three screws (flat head) still holding those rings together.

Remove the stickers on the front and the base of the tripod head.

Unscrew the screws that were underneath the stickers.
Unscrew the two screws (allen) on either side that hold the forward/back rotation.

Remove a solid steel barrel which will be in one of the parts.
Wash the lot in Simple Green (full strength) as this will remove all of the old lubricant.
Let dry and put it all back together lubricating as you go.
Put the head back on the tripod, once you have it back on the aluminum tube.

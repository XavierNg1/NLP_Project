Modify the sleeping hours for individual preferences and schedules.
Determine the amount of sleep required and have some flexibility in this figure.
Expect to have a restless night, if you had a full day and had little or no time for winding down before sleeping.
Control vision input.
Minimize sound with earplugs or headphones if you don't have earplugs available, not leaving the radio on, or by shutting all the windows tight (turn on the AC and adjust the thermostat).
Use air conditioners, humidifiers or filter air purifiers for particulate matter that is irritating.
Don't move.
Make the bed comfortable, bask in the glory of life (except when the music is blaring next door), good health and living free.

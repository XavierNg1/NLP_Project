Lay out your wax paper.
Prepare the icing tube.
Once that is done:


Spoon three large spoonfuls of yogurt into your icing tube and close the top by rolling it up, twisting it, or simply squeezing it tight.
Make yogurt drops!,
Once you have finished this sheet of wax paper, quickly but gently move it into the freezer and allow them to freeze.
Once you see that the drops have hardened, pull them out and place the paper on the counter.
Keep the bag in the refrigerator until you plan on using the drops.

Look over the list of directors and officers of the company.This section might give short biographies of the individuals sitting on the board and company officers like the President or CEO.

Review the sales and marketing section.
Read about the company’s holdings.Subsidiaries, brands, and addresses where the company has offices or plants will be listed here.

Beware of changing accounting practices.If, for instance, a company suddenly tallies up a large impairment charge (a reduction on the balance sheet due to a loss of goodwill), you should be worried why the company’s goodwill has diminished.
Read the proxy statement.The proxy statement, or proxy, is an attachment to the official 10-K form that shows how much the company’s executives are being paid.
Look for actual, not adjusted, earnings.

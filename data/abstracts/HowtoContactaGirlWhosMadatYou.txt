Don't be pushy, If she is mad at you, don't try to force her to speak to you.
Write her a letter, Girls love letters for a number of reasons.
In your letter, APOLOGIZE.
Make her smile.
Give her a bit of time.
If you have the guts, the most meaningful thing to do is call her.
To really make an impact, go see her.
Promise never to do what you did to make her angry.
If she doesn't accept at first, give her more time and keep trying to apologize.
Show her that you care, and apologize from your heart.

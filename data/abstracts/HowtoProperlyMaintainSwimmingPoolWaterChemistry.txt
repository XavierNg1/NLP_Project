Determine what type of chlorine you should use.
Use cyanuric acid with caution.
If you choose to avoid cyanuric acid, look for calcium hypochlorite (solid) or sodium hypochlorite (liquid).
Add the chlorine to your swimming pool.
Never simply dump chlorine tablets or sticks into your swimming pool or place them in the skimmer basket of your swimming pool (though there are certain brands made that only dissolve when water is flowing over them).
Shock the pool weekly.
Follow up the next morning with a maintenance dose of algaecide.
Maintain a proper pH level.
If pH is high, add a small amount of muriatic acid and retest the water after about 6 hours of continuous filtration, readjusting pH as needed.
If swimmers are having a problem with "burning eyes,‚Äù high or low pH is probably to blame, not high chlorine.

Test the water at least two times per week to ensure balance.
Put chlorine tablets in a pool floating chlorine feeder.

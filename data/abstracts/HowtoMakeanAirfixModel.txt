Buy the actual model.
Find a place to work; preferably somewhere you wonâ€™t be disturbed.
Wash all the items in soapy water with a dash of vinegar before you start construction.
Read the instructions carefully.
Paint pieces roughly smaller than 1cm while they are still on the sprues.
Test all your fits.
Apply the glue.
Be sure not to glue pieces like turrets and propellers to the model as they will have to move around.
Put the decal out of the water and onto some tissue to dry off excess water.
Hold the backing paper and the decal with tweezers up to where it should be on the plane.
Use weathering effects or gloss to finish off your model.
Well done!

Think it through carefully before you decide to confront your friend.
Look at how you are around your best friend.
Talk to your friend.
Stand up to your best friend.
When they reply, they will either be aggressive with you or peaceful.
Decide what is the best way to end the fight or disagreement.
Try to forgive your best friend.
If she/he doesn't listen to you, get your other friends to either talk to her/him about it, or hang about with them instead of your best friend until she/he gets the message.

If all else fails, you can either try to sort it out until they agree to stop or walk away.

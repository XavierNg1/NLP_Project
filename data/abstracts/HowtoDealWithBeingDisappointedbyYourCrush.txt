Try to not let yourself break down right in front of him/her.
When you are by yourself, allow yourself to cry if you need to.
Don't let this person bring you down because he/she is not even worth it.
Consider the positives of the situation.
If you see this person a lot, try not to avoid them.
Don't totally discount the idea of being friends in the future.
The most important thing to remember is continue to love yourself.

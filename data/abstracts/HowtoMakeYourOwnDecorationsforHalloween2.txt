Cut a body, two wings, and the head of a bat (with ears!),
Trace your template onto black craft foam.
Punch several holes into the bat to join the pieces together.
Align the holes on the body and the wings together and fasten with a brad.
Thread a string through the empty holes and tie in a loop.
Attach a ribbon and red sequin eyes.

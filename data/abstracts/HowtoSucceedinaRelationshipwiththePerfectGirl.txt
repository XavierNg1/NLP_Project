Talk.
People love talking about themselves.
Try to avoid asking lots of questions about where she's been and what she was doing.
Think before you speak!,
Compliments are excellent, but know that you should stop at the point where you're just listening to yourself talk.
Nobody can write the definitive guide on dating!,
Listen to what she has to say and pay attention.

,
Above all, take care of yourself.
Don't be obsessive.
Don't cheat on her!!,
Make her friends like you, not love you.

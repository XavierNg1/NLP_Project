Start with brushed, tangle-free hair.
Gather some hair at the back of your head into a half-up, half-down ponytail.
Divide the hair chunk into three even sections.
Start with a standard braid.
Add a small strand of hair to the right section.
Cross the now-thicker right section over the middle section.
Add a small strand of hair to the left section.
Cross the now-thicker left section over the new middle section.
Continue French braiding your hair until you reach the nape of your neck.
Decide how you want to finish off your braid.
Tie your braid off with a hair tie.
Consider tying a ribbon around the end of your braid after you tie it off.

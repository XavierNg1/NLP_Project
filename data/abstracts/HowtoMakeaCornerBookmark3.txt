Cut two 2½ by 2½-inch (6.35 by 6.35 centimeters) squares out of a sheet of paper.
Draw a diagonal line across one of those squares.
Cut along the line that you drew.
Cover both sides of the blank square with duct tape, trimming off any excess tape.
Place the triangle on top of a 3½-inch (8.89 centimeters) long strip of duct tape, with the point touching the top edge.
Fold the excess tape at the bottom over onto the triangle.
Place the square on top of the triangle.
Fold the flaps of tape down.

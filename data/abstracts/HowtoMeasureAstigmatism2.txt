Use a corneal topographer for more precise measurements.
Try a Placido disc for irregular astigmatism.The Placido disc is an old-fashioned, hand-held device that is shaped like a giant lollipop.
Use a Scheimpflug device to measure the posterior cornea.The shape of your posterior cornea (the back surface of the cornea) can influence the severity of your astigmatism.Keratometry can only measure the front of your cornea, but Scheimpflug imaging uses tomography to get more accurate readings of how thick your cornea is and what the back of it looks like.This method can be helpful in predicting how successful surgery may be in correcting your astigmatism.

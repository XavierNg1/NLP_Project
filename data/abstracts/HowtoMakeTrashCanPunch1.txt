Clean a brand-new trash can with dish soap and hot water.
Pour the Everclear into the trash can.
Add the vodka.
Add the Hawaiian Fruit Punch into the trash can.
Clean the fruit with cold water.
Cut and slice the fruit, and add them to the trash can.
Stir everything with a long-handled spoon.

Add ice just before the party begins.

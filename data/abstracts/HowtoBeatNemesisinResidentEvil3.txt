Decide whether on not you actually want to fight the Nemesis- on Easy he does not drop anything, however on Hard he drops weaponry upgrades.
Expect a long fight, and bring plenty of ammunition.
While unarmed the Nemesis will use four forms of attack, all of them dodge-able.
When using his rocket launcher the Nemesis loses his signature grab, however keep in mind that you always dodge rockets to Jill's left.

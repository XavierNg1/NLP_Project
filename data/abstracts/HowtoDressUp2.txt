Read the wedding invitation carefully.
Follow the traditional rules when it comes to color.
Base your accessories on the formality of the occasion.
Glam it up if the invitation says “White Tie.” Considered the most formal (think charity balls, royal events and the Academy Awards), you’re limited as to what you should or should not wear.
Wear formal attire if the invitation says “Black Tie.” Considered the next most formal style of wedding, you can wear either a floor-length evening gown or a formal-style cocktail dress.
Dress to impress but also for the elements if the invitation says “Beach Formal.” This invite suggests an elegant wedding on the beach so still dress up.
Find a happy-medium between casual and formal if the invitation says “Dressy Casual” or “Semi-formal.” For an evening ceremony, good choices are a long, dressy skirt with a stylish blouse or a cocktail dress (just above or at the knee), preferably made in a rich fabric like silk, satin or chiffon with beading.

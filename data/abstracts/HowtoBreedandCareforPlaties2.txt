Get suitable food and make sure that you don't put aggressive fish in with your platies.

,
Add one or two fish to start with.
Select the big, colorful platies because this is a sign that they are healthy.

If you want fry (baby fish), get 2 to 3 females for every male.
If you don't want fry, only get one gender.
Once you have brought the fish home, place the unopened bag in the tank for 15 minutes to get them used to the temperature.

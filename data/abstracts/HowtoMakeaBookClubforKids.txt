Make sure everyone wants to be in a book club.If you’re a parent and trying to start a book club for your child, ask your child if they wish to participate in the book club.
Decide who can participate.In a book club for kids, all the kids should be of about the same age and reading level.
Choose the size of the book club.If the book club is too large, not every child will get to participate.
Advertise your book club.If your child has enough friends or classmates to make a club of adequate size, there is no need to advertise the club.
Decide where to hold the book club.The location where you host the book club depends on your situation.
Start out with an organizational meeting.An organizational meeting is an initial meeting between the kids in the book club and their parents or guardians.
Explain the rules of the club.Rules should be laid out for both parents and kids.
Explain the structure of the book club.Decide with the other parents and kids how often you want to meet, and choose the days and times that work best.
Set the goals of the book club.State at the outset what the overall vision or mission of the book club is.
Choose a theme.A theme is a central topic or idea that all the books in the club revolve around.
Choose the book or books you’ll be reading.It’s a good idea to decide at least one month ahead of time what book the club will read next.
Structure the discussion.Every club meeting should have two discussion leaders.
Offer encouragement to reluctant readers.
Don’t be too formal.The book club shouldn’t feel like a literature class.
Add something extra.After reading a book, you could allow time for the kids to do a fun craft related to the book they read.

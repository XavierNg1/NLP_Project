Understand that it is impossible to have a healthy relationship without a disagreement now and then.
Lay Down "Rules of Engagement".
Do not suppress emotions or pretend there is no problem.
Keep YouTube's of humor.
Remember that "Flooding" a man with emotions is a high predictor of divorce.
Know that couples who end up being successful, while in love, are not the couples who get married while still "starry-eyed".
Keep in mind honesty, intimacy, and realism are important, and "whirlwind romances" rarely make it.
Know that similarity in values, backgrounds, and goals are a good predictor of success.
Do not engage in 'intense' arguments.
Observe reactions to events.

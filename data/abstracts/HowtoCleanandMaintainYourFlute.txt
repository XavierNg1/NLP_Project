Learn to assemble your flute properly.
Warm up the flute by playing or blowing warm air through it before tuning.
After each and every playing session, take your flute apart, so that the three pieces are separated.

,
Thread a soft cloth through the needle-like slot in the end of your tuning rod and flip the cloth over the cleaning rod, then wrap it around the rod so that there is none of the rod showing at the top, otherwise, you will scratch the inside of your precious flute.
Carefully polish the flute with a different cloth - clean all the keys and the bodywork until it's free of fingerprints and other possible gunk.
Carefully clean the lip plate with the cloth, as this is the most fragile part of the flute.

,
You can use a Q-tip dipped in rubbing alcohol to remove dust and buildup between the keys in those hard to reach spots, but it's not recommended to do this too often.
Clean your pads if they are sticky from water build up.
Store and carry your flute in its case, avoiding moisture and temperature extremes.
Keep your springs in their places and do not mess around with the mechanisms and screws unless you know what you are doing.
Check your tuning cork periodically.
Pay attention to your pads.
Have your flute serviced periodically by somebody who specializes in flutes, or woodwind, at the least.
Remember: Take care of your flute, and it will take care of you.

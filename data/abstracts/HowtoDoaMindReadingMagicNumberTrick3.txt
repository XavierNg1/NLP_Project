Choose a volunteer from a crowd.
Ask your volunteer to remember four letters: "B Z T K".
Ask your volunteer to remember six letters: "D J R N Q P".
Ask your volunteer to remember ten letters: "M T X H V L F C S V".
Stop and make the crowd acknowledge that the volunteer canâ€™t remember 10 letters.
Tell your volunteer to remember 14 letters: "F R O G B A T P I G D U C K." This trick works because the 14 letters spell out FROG-BAT-PIG-DUCK.

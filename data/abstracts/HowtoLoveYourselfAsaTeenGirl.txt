Get rid of all those magazines that give you all these false images of what beauty is.
Be kind to yourself.
Every day think of something you like about yourself that is not looks-related, (sense of humor, music, sports, etc.).
Every time you pass a mirror or any place you can see your reflection, say something positive to yourself, such as "I love you," "you're beautiful," "You rock," ," I accept ME", etc.
Remember compliments you receive.
Know that your friends and family love you for who you really are inside.
When someone does insult you, ask a friend to share something they like about you.
Build a network of supporting relationships in your family and community.
Two wrongs don't make a right.
Don't be afraid to work towards what you want!,
Treat yourself often, and you will feel better about yourself.
Most importantly, be a good person!

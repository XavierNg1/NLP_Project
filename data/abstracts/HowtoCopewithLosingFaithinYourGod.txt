Keeping Family and Friends;
,
Keep going to social and ceremonial events.
Decide whom you do and don't want to tell.
Ask your family and friends for time and space, if they insist on trying to help you back to faith.
Avoiding talking about it to strongly religious members of your family and friends.
Re-Finding Faith.
Recognize the important things in your life.
Find more important things.
Re-awaken your old dreams.
Spend time and energy on the things that are important, not the things that arenâ€™t.
Just because you are no longer superstitious; just because you are moving away from belief in the supernatural, does not mean you need to leave your values or identity behind.

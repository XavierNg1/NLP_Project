Open up your suitcase so every bit of packing space is visible.
Get out all the clothes you want to take and organize them like this:


A pile of things you must take
A separate pile of things you want to take
Another pile with things that you could live without

,
Put your shoes in one section.
As a suitcase usually has two sides, use the side with your shoes in for extra little bits - your toiletries: You will need to take shampoo, toothpaste, shower gel and anything else you use on a day-to-day basis.
The next side should be for clothes.
Put a label inside your suitcase, giving information of an address to return it to, just in case.

,
Anything extra should be taken in hand luggage.
Choose clothes for travelling in carefully.
Have a great holiday!

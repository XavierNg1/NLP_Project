Before installing the pump, let the air conditioner run a few cycles so that some condensate collects and to remove any oils that are left in the system. 
,Make sure that all of the packaging is removed from the pump, and that all venting slots are clear from debris.
Set up the electrical connections.
Check the local codes to make sure you are hooking up your wires correctly. ,
Hook up the power cord to the specified voltage. ,Make sure it is connected to a constant power source.
Check the pump for a safety switch and wire it accordingly.



 

Connect the pump to the wall by using screws.
Make sure that the pump is close to the air conditioning unit, installed below the coil drain, and that the pump unit is level.
Use some sort of flexible tubing, if possible, as the drain pipe for the pump.
Once the pump has been installed, turn the power back on and run the a/c unit.

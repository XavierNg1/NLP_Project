Type out your table of contents first.
Go to the top left corner of the ruler.
Within the table of contents, select the text you want to reformat.
Click on the ruler towards the right side to place the right tab stop there.
Set leader dots.
Adjust the formatting to allow the leader dots to extend beyond the point where the text wraps to the next line.
Keep the indent marker temporarily positioned over to the right of the tab stop.
Go back to the right indent marker (which should still be situated to theÂ right of the tab stop).
Make sure the TOC entry is now formatted properly.
Keep the Format painter button activated.
You're done!

Grow, or locate, a U-pick produce grower that allows customers to pick peas in their field.
Prepare yourself for your outing in the pea patch.
Enter the field and select a row of peas to pick.

Step carefully to avoid damaging the pea vines, which often overlap the rows and can be entangled, making travel difficult.

Watch for peas which have obvious insect damage.

Pick the desired amount of peas and carry them home.
Rinse the peas under lots of fresh water, then transfer them into a clean container for shelling.

Be yourself.
Avoid brand names and mainstream stores.
Bring it back.
Mix a whole bunch of styles if you so choose.
Don't believe the hype.
Go for layers.
Jazz it up with jewelry and accessories.
If the shoe fits, wear it.
Make your own clothes.
Dress for the weather.
Be eco-friendly.
Let your hair do its thing.
Rock a set of headphones.

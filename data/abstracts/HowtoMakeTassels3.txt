Cut a 10 by 3½ inch (25.4 by 8.89 centimeters) rectangle of leather or suede.This will make the body of your tassel.
Cut a 3 by ¼ inch (7.62 by 0.64 centimeters) strip of leather or suede.This will make the loop so that you can hang your tassel later on.
Fold the small strip in half to make a loop, and secure the ends with glue.
Hold the ends together with a binger clip or a clothespin until the glue dries.
Draw a horizontal line across the rectangle, ¾ inch (1.91 centimeters) from the top/long edge.This will be your guideline.
Draw vertical lines, spaced ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) apart.Make sure that they are going from the bottom of the rectangle up to the horizontal line.
Cut the vertical lines using a sharp pair of scissors or a craft blade.
Glue the small loop to the left side of your fringe.
Start rolling the fringe around the loop, from left to right.
Secure the end of the rectangle with glue.
Wrap a rubber band around the tassel to hold it together until it dries.
Consider wrapping a piece of ribbon or colored thread around the top to hide the seam.
Use your tassel.

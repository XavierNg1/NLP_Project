Prepare the grill to help the chicken cook better.
Light the grill, according to your model's instructions, and let preheat on a medium-hot setting for about 5 minutes before placing the chicken onto the grill.
Check the bottom side of the chicken breasts after about 3 minutes and flip them when they begin to look opaque.
Grill the other side for approximately 5 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness of your chicken breasts.

Plan to take Rose of Sharon cuttings in summertime.
Always take more cuttings than you need.
Take a 5 inch (12.7Â cm) cutting from your Rose of Sharon plant.
Propagate your Rose of Sharon cuttings in compost.
Alternatively, propagate your Rose of Sharon cuttings in water.
Change the water regularly until the cutting is ready to plant.
Be aware that plants grown from seed may not look like the parent plant.
Look underneath your existing plant for any seedlings.
Wait until the pods turn brown before harvesting them for seeds.
Sow your seeds in a seed compost.
Keep the planted seeds moist and in a bright location.
Mulch established Rose of Sharon plants in the spring.
Prune the plant back in the early springtime.
Consider feeding your Rose of Sharon over the summer months.
Spray the plant with insecticide if it becomes infested with pests.

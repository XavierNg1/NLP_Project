Begin your painting with a charcoal sketch.
Shake off the excess charcoal or spray the canvas with a fixative to prevent smudging.

,
Add values of lightness and darkness to the sketch with an underpainting.
Allow the underpainting to dry.
Combine your oil paints on your palette to create the darkest shade in your blend.
Apply your shades in their approximate final locations, using the underpainting as a reference.

,
Create a transition between the first two shades using a crosshatch stroke.
Smooth the blend by using parallel strokes along the transition you just created.
Use a clean brush to blend the next shade, and repeat the technique using first crosshatched strokes followed by parallel stokes.
Finished.

Start from the rhythmic foundation (percussion and bass), the chord progression (guitar and/or keys), or the melody (lead guitar/keys).
Create a groovy bass line that complements the melody but doesn't copy it note for note (use counterpoint for example).

,
Make a drum beat starting with just the kick and snare that complements and supports the bassline.
Create a rhythm or beat that complements the core or foundation of the song.
Play individual notes randomly, then see which ones sound good playing at the same time and use that to build chords from scratch.

,
While you write the music, write lyrics to the song.
Make sure you put in all the essential elements: Intro, verse, hook, bridge (optional), and outro/CODA.
Pick a key idea of the song or a catchy phrase and a cool guitar or keyboard lick to create a melody.
Once you have it to this point add a pad, sound effects, lead parts, etc.

,
If your song "tastes" or sounds right then you've done a good job!

,
Record your song then listen to it as a music critic would you listen.
Go back and make any adjustments you need to.

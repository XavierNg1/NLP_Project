Select someone.
Choose a good time to talk to them.
Once you have the person, explain why you want to encourage them to blog.
If they say no, accept it.
If they say yes, help him or her step onto the blogging trail.
Show them the basics of blogging.
Let them have their own.
Be aware that blog buddies can fall apart.
Have fun!

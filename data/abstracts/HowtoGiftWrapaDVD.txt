Cut the wrapping paper so it is about an inch longer than the DVD box and wraps around the box with a little overlap.
Center the DVD box on the "wrong" (unprinted) side of the paper.
Working at the bottom end of the box, push the small right and left sides of the paper flat against the box to create two angled flaps sticking off the bottom of the box.
Turn the box so the top end faces you now.
Flip the gift over so the folded edges are facing downwards.

Decorate the package with a bow, ribbon or gift card as desired.
Finished.

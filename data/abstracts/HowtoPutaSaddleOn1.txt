Note that saddling normally mainly takes place on the left side of the horse.
Have the saddle pad and saddle ready.
Place the saddle pad on the horse's back so that the straps on the side are inline with the back of the horses shoulder.
Check from the front of the horse that the saddle pad is even on both sides of the horse.
Gently lay the saddle on top of the saddle pad evenly.
Get the girth and feed the non stretchy side through the straps on the right side of the horse and attach it to the first billet hole.
On the other side of the horse, pick up the girth and attach it to the first billet hole on that side as well.Check and make sure the girth is not pinching the horse anywhere.Adjust your stirrups to the right length before riding.

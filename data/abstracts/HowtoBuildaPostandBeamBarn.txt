Before you even get your materials delivered, prepare the site.
Build your foundation.
Before your barn kit arrives be sure that you have adequate space to unload a tractor trailer.
Carefully unload your lumber making sure not to damage your material with the forks on your machine.
Bent Assembly


On a level plane lay out all of the timbers for your first bent.
Once you have bolted all the timbers together and have an assembled bent it is time to raise it into place.
Before painting or sealing your barn with any finish allow your barn to season.

When planning a guest list, make sure that if you are sending out invitations, you politely ask your guests not to discuss the party with others unless they know that they're invited.
Don't plan a minute-by-minute or any other type of schedule for the party.
Plan a few, maybe 2 or 3 events for the party.
Do not put out boatloads of food.
Some of the best foods to serve are fruit platters, a bowl of chips, and mainly pizza for dinner.
The best drinks to serve in order for your guests not to dehydrated are pretty simple.
Put the food somewhere reachable, preferably on a table.
Don't ignore your guests.
You don't have to have goodie bags or anything to say thank you.
Make sure your guests are interacting with each other.
You can also move aside the furniture in one room as a dance floor.
Guests like to help too!,
Last but not least, have a good time yourself.
Give you're guests an adequate sense of autonomy..

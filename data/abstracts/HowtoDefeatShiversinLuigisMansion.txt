Make sure you have the Fire Elemental Medal.
Now that you have the Fire Element, go back to the hallway with the floating candelabra and light the candle using your fire.
Go to the Butler's room (using the key you found earlier) and wait for Shivers to come in.
Vacuum up this butler's HP and get the key to the Conservatory.

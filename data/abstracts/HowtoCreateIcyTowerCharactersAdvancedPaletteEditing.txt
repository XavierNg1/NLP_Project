(If you already made a character, go to step 6)Let's start by downloading the right programs.
When you downloaded (or already) have the game, go to the folder where it's installed (most of the time it's c:\games\icytower13),
Locate the folder characters\template.

FIRST make a backup of the entire template folder, just to make sure.
When opened up in paint you can edit freely.These are the basics, now for the advanced editing.



 NeoPaint

We use NeoPaint for this.When downloaded and installed, open your Icy Tower character bitmap with it.





You will notice the color blocks on the left, this is the palette.
The colors of the blocks are the 16 rainbow colors on the right.
Once opened up, you will get a window with same sliders and the color blocks.
Now select the recently edited colors as color 1 and color 2 (Doesn't matter which one first).
Now press OK. You will see a window pop up first.
Now let's try the tower itself (!WARNING: This is hard to do, always make a back-up first!),
Go back to your image and your palette.
You need to experiment.
Hint: Just as I said at the font color step, just try out a reflected gradient by splitting it in half.
OK, now we have changed font colors and changed level colors.
This part is a little harder, because there are about 27 floors.





Go back to your character and the palette.
Just do the same thing you did with the rest.
That's all I know about Icy Tower palette editing.

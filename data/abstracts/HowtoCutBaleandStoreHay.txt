Start tedding the hay the day within a day of cutting.
Turn the hay one to three times over the next three days.
Test the hay frequently to see what its internal moisture content is.
Rake the hay together in large windrows.
Consider a small square baler if you have a small operation.
Use square bales if you keep goats and sheep.
Pick small square bales if you want to market your hay to small livestock operations.

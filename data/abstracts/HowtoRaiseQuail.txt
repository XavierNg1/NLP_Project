Take some thought on raising quail.
Find a space in your yard or on your balcony where you can hang a quail cage.
Purchase a long, narrow cage and hang it from an overhang on your house, garage or balcony.
Hang some lights around the cage.
Decide if you want to buy mating birds or hatching eggs.
Decide how many birds you need based on your egg consumption.
Look for a good egg laying breed.
Go to Craigslist or look in your local paper first.
Check on eBay to find hatching eggs.
Try local ranch or farm supply and feed stores.
Buy at least two females for every male, but keep males separated.
Purchase an incubator at the feed store or ranch supply store if you plan to raise hatching eggs.
Keep the humidity at 45 to 50 percent during incubation and 65 to 70 percent during the 23rd day of hatching.
Adjust the temperature of the incubator so that it is 100 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius).
Donâ€™t turn the egg turner on until three days after the eggs are laid.
Keep the quail in a small space once they are hatched.
Keep up to 100 quail chicks in a two by three foot space for the first ten days.
Give chicks a chick starter feed up until they are six to eight weeks old.
Ensure that each bird has three to 4ft2 (1 m2) of space in the cage.

,
Provide quail with clean drinking water.
Change the straw beneath the cages daily.
Clean the cage out if any waste starts to build.
Start to adjust conditions and change the food to a laying fowl mix at five to six weeks.
Provide crushed oyster shells and grit for your quail.
Keep the animals undisturbed after six weeks of age.
Consider adding fresh greens, seeds and small insects to your quail feed.

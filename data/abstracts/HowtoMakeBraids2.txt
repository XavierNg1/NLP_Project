Prep your hair.
Separate your hair into three even sections at the crown of the head (or side of the head, if that's where you want the braid to start): left, right, and middle.
Cross the right section over the middle section of hair.
Cross the left section over the middle section.
Before you begin the pattern again--crossing the right section over the middle section--gather about an inch more hair and incorporate it into the right section.
Cross the new, thicker right section over the middle section.
Cross the new, thicker left section over the middle section.
Repeat the pattern, gathering equal amounts of hair from the left and right sides of the head and incorporating them into the left or right section. 







,
Finish the bottom of the hair with a basic braid and secure with an elastic.

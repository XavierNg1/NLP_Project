Determine the soil characteristics of the lake, lagoon or stream bed you are installing your piles into.
Obtain your pilings.
Rent a 2 or 3 inch (5.1 or 7.6Â cm) gasoline-powered water pump, a suction or "pickup" hose long enough to draw water from the lake or seawater that you are installing pilings in, and a discharge hose long enough to reach the end of the pier from the location where you plan to set the pump.
Build a "jetting pipe".
Lay out the location of your pilings by using a 2X4 wood stake driven into the ground on the bank, and another driven into the pond bottom beyond the location of the last piling.
Stand a piling on end in the water, raise your jet pipe alongside it, and turn on the pump.
Plumb up the piling with two spirit levels and a bungee cord, and quickly make sure it is vertical before the soil settles back into the hole.
Wash sand or dirt back around the piling with the jetting pipe after the piling is sunk, to refill the hole what you washed out.

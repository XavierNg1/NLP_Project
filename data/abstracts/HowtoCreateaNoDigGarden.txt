Build a raised bed first, if you wish.
Save your newspapers, including local and free press papers, that you recycle.
Get enough mulch from your local nursery (color/texture to your liking) to cover the area to a depth of three inches.
Pace out the area you wish to convert.
Closely mow or cut the area in preparation, leaving everything lying on the ground.
Water the area well, or let the next rainstorm do the job.
Fill a wheelbarrow or other container with newspapers and cover them with water.

,
Open the wet newspapers and layer them onto the ground three or four sheets thick, overlapping a couple of inches at the edges.
Add a planting layer or layers.
Spread the mulch.
Finish the edges, if you did not build a raised bed first.
Wait nine to ten months (if you didn't add a planting layer) and then make holes through the mulch/paper and start planting.

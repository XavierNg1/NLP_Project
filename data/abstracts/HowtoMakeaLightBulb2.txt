Cut some copper wire into two sections, roughly 1-2 feet each.
Remove 1" of shielding from each end of the wire.
Use the nail to pierce two holes into a cork.
Thread one end of each copper wire through the cork.
Bend the end of the two strands inside the cork into a hook shape.
Cut the iron wire into 1-1/2 to 2 inch (3.8cm to 5cm) strips.
Twist the five iron wire lengths together with your fingers.
Place the twisted iron wires onto the copper hooks, making sure it touches both copper strands.
Lay the jar on top of the cork.
Wrap both ends of the wire around separate ends of a battery to turn the light on.
Troubleshoot if you're not getting enough light.

Focus on what your dreams are like.Reflective-intention techniques, also known as the Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreaming (MILD) require you to think about the kinds of things you dream about, or the typical features of your dreams, before you go to bed.This helps you recognize them while you are dreaming.
Tell yourself you will have interesting, memorable dreams.If you believe you can be aware of your dreams while you are having them, and remember them upon waking, then you are more likely to actually do so.
Increase your intake of vitamin B6.
Take melatonin.
Take 5-HTP.
Take galantamine.
Do reality checks.
Practice the Wake-Back-to-Bed (WBTB) technique.This method asks you to schedule an alarm to wake yourself an hour before you normally would, helping to catch you in the middle of a dream.
Set alarms to catch you during dream periods.Research shows that people typically dream in 90-minute cycles, and so if you time alarms to wake yourself during them, you will be more likely to recall what you were dreaming about.
Make sure that you are well-rested.If you are trying to sleep when you are already exhausted, you will probably fall into a deep sleep and have trouble waking up and remembering your dreams.
Think about your dreams as soon as you wake up.Once you are ready to wake up, start thinking about the dream you were having.
Use a dream journal.

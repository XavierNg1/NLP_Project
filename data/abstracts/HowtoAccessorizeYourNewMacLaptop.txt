Choose an overall color scheme.
Buy a laptop skin.
Decide if you want any stickers or decals.
Choose your desktop wallpaper.
Choose your screensaver.
Decide if you want a mouse or a mouse pad.
Look over your finished computer.
Give yourself a pat on the back, then show off your computer to all your jealous friends!

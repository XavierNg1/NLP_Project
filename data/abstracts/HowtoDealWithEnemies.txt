If you donâ€™t know why they hate you, ask them calmly and nicely.
If you know why they hate you, be mature and apologize if it was your fault.
Show them respect as you show to your friends; when they need help, help them.
If you try to help people who are purportedly hostile and they retaliate unkindly, stop helping.
Ignore whatever this person says.
If this person starts being violent towards you or continue offending you or upsetting you, and ignoring them is not helping, tell them that their behavior is upsetting you and tell them that they have no reason for it.
Surround yourself with friends and people who like you for who you are.

Gather your materials.
Mark all hardware with tape or wire twist ties.
Remove the old hardware.
Prepare a warm water bath.
Remove the hot hardware with plastic tongs or chopsticks to avoid scratching.
Finish up by placing the hardware in a bath in isopropyl rubbing alcohol, if needed.
Grease any hinge pins and re-install.
If you're using brass finishes, coat them with beeswax or olive oil to preserve the finish.

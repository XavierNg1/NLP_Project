Rip out about 100 colorful pages from your old magazines.
Cut your magazine pages vertically in varying sizes.
Make a very small fold at the bottom right corner of the strip.
Repeat this rod-making process with the other colorful strips of paper.
Place all the rods underneath a heavy dictionary or other book.
Start with the fatter end of the flat strip and begin rolling it tightly into a spiral.
Repeat this with your remaining flattened magazine rods.
Glue the magazine beads together with hot glue in the shape that you have decided to use.
Glue a chain to the back of the bead cluster.
Allow the chain to dry for a few hours.

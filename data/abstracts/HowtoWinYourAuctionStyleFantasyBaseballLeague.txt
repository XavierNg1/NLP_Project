Go into the draft with a plan, don't just wing it.Most money leagues have a salary cap of $260 on draft day.
Get a season preview, preferably the most recent edition; most of the time they are weekly publications.

,
Rank players for each position -- do about the top 50 or so for each position, and more than that for pitchers, utility players, and corner men and middle infielders.
Determine what players are really worth $40, what players are worth $20, and what players are the minimum ($1).
Find the middle-priced guys that will help back up your highly-priced star players.

,
Decide if you are going to build your team around pitching or hitting, either strategy can bring you success, but ensure your team is strong in one or the other so you can take all available points in the categories.
Think hard about in-season pickups, especially if pickups cost additional money in your league.

,
Look for "the redeemers": stars who disappoint for one year and fall in the fantasy draft.
Make sure you are making good trades.

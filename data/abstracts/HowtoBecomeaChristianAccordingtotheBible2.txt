See what the Bible says, "How do I become a Christian?",
Remember that God gives each one the option to repent: "The Lord is long suffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should 'come to repentance' .",
Be sure to receive your free gift, intended for everyone that would believe and seek it: be saved from having to endure the punishment of sins, through Jesus Christ His Son.
Love God is the first commandment and love your neighbor is second: to fulfill the Law.
Believe and be baptized "in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost" and some say that that means "in Jesus name" (John 3:5) and be filled with His Holy Spirit, as seen and explained in the book of Acts (Acts 2:4).
Being a "true Christian" doesn't particularly suggest that you must adhere to the practices of one denomination (governing body of Churches).
Accept and understand the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as God Himself has revealed it to you:


"to open their eyes, to turn from darkness to light, and the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.

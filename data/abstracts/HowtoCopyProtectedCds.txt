Step 0: Is This Legal?,
In short, I don't know if it's legal or not, but consider the following.A Discman from Sony ,A Wall-Mounted CD Player from Muji ,A DP-470 DVD Player from Kiss Technology ,My Linux box from Dell ,
It turned out the CD contained ‘copy control technology,’ which prevented it from working on the players listed above.
To solve this problem, I created a copy of the CD as described here.
Because I don't usually copy CDs, I found it a little ironic that the ‘copy control technology’ required me to make a copy of the album in order to use it.
In the meantime, I hope this guide will help people who are in a similar situation.
Step 1: Download IsoBuster

,
The first step is to download and install IsoBuster, a program used to salvage data from damaged CDs and DVDs.
Step 2: Create a Folder for the Audio Tracks

,
The idea is to use IsoBuster to extract the hidden audio tracks from the protected CD and burn them to a normal CD, so the first thing to do is create a folder somewhere to store the audio tracks.
Step 3: Open the Copy-Protected CD with IsoBuster

,
First, start up IsoBuster and hold down your shift key while inserting your copy-protected CD.

,
I recommend that you hold down the shift key because it blocks the Windows ‘autorun’ feature, i.e. prevents the CD from launching programs automatically.
After inserting the CD, you should now see something like the following:

,
As you can see, the CD has two sessions, unlike a normal audio CD, which only has one.
To get at the audio tracks with IsoBuster, click on session 1 on the left in the IsoBuster window.
Step 4: Extract the Audio Tracks

,
Use your mouse to mark all the audio tracks in the right part of the window, then right click and choose ‘Extract Objects’ from the menu:

,
IsoBuster will ask you for a destination directory; choose the one you created previously:

,
Now wait for the files to copy...

,
When the copy has finished, you can shut down IsoBuster.

,
Step 5: Burn the Audio Tracks onto a Blank CD

,
Now open your favourite CD burning software and use it to create an Audio CD.
Enjoy!

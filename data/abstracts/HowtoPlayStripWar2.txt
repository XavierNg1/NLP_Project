Set up as if you were playing a normal game of war.
Go to “war” if you and your opponent play cards of the same rank.
Remove an article of clothing if you lose a War tiebreaker.You and your opponent can either plan which articles of clothing are removed in which order, or you can let the winner of the tiebreaker decide which article of clothing the loser must remove.
Play until someone has won all of the cards in the deck.

Select the right peanuts for boiling.
Wash and pick through your peanuts, removing loose soil and sprouts, stems, weeds, and leaves.
Set up a cooker if you are boiling a large amount at one time, or get a good heavy pot to place on the stove.

,
Pour your peanuts into the pot, and add enough water to cover them by 2 or more inches.
Add salt to taste.
Add other seasonings if you prefer.
Bring the contents to a boil.
Stir the peanuts about every 15-20 minutes, making sure the water has not boiled down.
After an hour or so, remove some of the peanuts with a slotted spoon and test (taste) them.
Taste for saltiness.
Turn off the stove/burner when the peanuts are salty and tender enough to suit you.
Refrigerate or freeze leftover peanuts in zipper type freezer bags for later enjoyment.

Line up several translations, side-by-side, and compare the same verses.
Consider your purpose.
Decide what kind of translation you would like.
Some consider the King James Version (KJV) but do remember that the English language has changed since the 1600s.
Remember that several major translations fall somewhere between the highly literal/thought for thought spectrum.
Before purchasing a Bible read the translators preface- this will help you to determine the philosophy of the translators, and whether the translation is likely to be more or less literal.

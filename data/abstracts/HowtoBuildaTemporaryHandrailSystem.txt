Look at the construction methods used in the building to determine what type of supports will work best for your handrail system.
Decide what the load capacity of your system should be.

Consider alternate methods for projects where conventional handrails built with cables and steel posts, or wooden rails on metal or wood posts are not practical.
Design your handrail system with the existing conditions in mind.

Estimate the amount of materials you need.

Lay out the location for the handrail posts, then, using a safe access method, install them.

Fasten the posts around all edges requiring protection.

Attach the handrail system to the structural members of the building where possible to increase its strength.

Install the handrail material after you have installed the posts.

Install the access ladder or other means for workers to climb to the elevated area.

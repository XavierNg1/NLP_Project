When you find the dog check for a collar and id tag.
Try to determine the dog's age.
Go to the store for supplies.
Something else you will need to get is dewormer, dog soap and a flea collar.
Once you have the necessary supplies you need to set the dog or puppy an area for himself.
It is a good idea to comfort and cuddle with the dog.
Use an old bowl to put food and water in.
When the pet is nicely settled in take a break and think.
If you want to find the owner get the word out.
If you want to give the pet away make flyers.
If you plan on keeping the dog or pup get a collar and a tag.

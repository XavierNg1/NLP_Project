Tear the sheet long and wide enough to wrap around the body twice then fold lengthwise in a trifold manner.
Keep in mind the purpose of the sheet is to not only contain the poultice that you will spread on the cheesecloth and secure it to the body comfortably, but you want it to contain enough of the poultice to completely cover the affected area.
Be sure to measure out enough sheet to overlap and pin securely around the affected area on the patient.
Lay it somewhere flat then measure and cut a piece of cheesecloth long enough and wide enough to be able to spread the poultice on.
Using dried comfrey, make the poultice.
Spread the mucilage onto the cheesecloth.
Place it where the wet poultice will soak through the sheet against the skin then wrap the sheet around the body accordingly and secure it with the safety pin.

Do this three times a day and let the healing begin.

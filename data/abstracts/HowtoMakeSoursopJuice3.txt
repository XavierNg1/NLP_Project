For a slightly thicker soursop juice, blend the juice instead of straining it by hand.
Remove the seeds and the fibrous core from the mashed soursop.
Pour the liquid into a blender.
Add any extra flavorings to the liquid in the blender.
Mix the ingredients together using a medium to high speed setting.
Add more water if the juice is too thick.
Serve the juice chilled or in glasses with ice.

Preheat the oven to 400°F (205°C).
Cut the acorn squash in half, vertically.
Pry the two halves apart, and scrape out the seeds and pulp with a metal spoon.
Place the squash on a roasting pan.
Fill each half with equal amounts of butter, brown sugar, maple syrup, salt, and pepper.
Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes.
Let the squash cool before serving.

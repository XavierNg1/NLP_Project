Be known to live honestly, i.e.
Be enthusiastic about your and the students' work (praise the work not the student) or the cause and also about your role as leader.
Roll up your sleeves and get dirty/do not sit, or yawn and look bored.
Be orderly and purposeful in situations of uncertainty by portraying a confident and positive demeanor.
Tolerate ambiguity (wait and see) and remain calm, proactively composed and steadfast to the main purpose.
Focus on the whole but see its parts to think analytically and break it down into sub parts for closer inspection.
Raise the bar.

Rinse off and quarter a 3-4 lb chicken, leaving the skin on.
Using a mortar and pestal, crush up 7-8 kernels of whole allspice as finely as possible.
Roughly chop up 1-2 Scotch Bonnet peppers and 1 bunch of green onions.
Toss 3 tablespoons seasoning salt, 2-3 sprigs fresh thyme, and a pinch of black pepper in the food processor with the peppers, onions, and allspice.
Add 1/2 cup of water to the food processor and blend until there are only light chunks.
Alternatively, hand mash all the ingredients into a paste using a mortar and pestal.
Spread half off the jerk marinade under the skin of the chicken.
Spread half of the remaining marinade on top of the chicken, saving the rest for basting.
Refrigerate the chicken overnight in an oven-safe pan to marinade.
Heat the oven to 350 and cook the chicken for 1 hour, flipping halfway through.
Serve hot, with rice and beans and a splash of fresh lime juice.

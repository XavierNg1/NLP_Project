Start with clean, damp hair.
Bend over at the waist, with your head pointing downward.
Comb or brush your hair into a ponytail near the top of your head.
Secure your ponytail tightly with an elastic band.
Place another elastic band further down the ponytail.
Cut your hair just above the second elastic band.
Release your hair from the ponytail.
Make some finishing touches.

Draw out your desired design on a piece of paper using a pencil.
Use a pencil or a disappearing ink pen to transfer your design to your fabric.
Switch to the painting tool of your choice and paint over the image that you just traced.
To create a watercolor look, mix your paint color with water until it is the thickness of writing ink.
To airbrush a stencil, use fabric spray paint.
To create texture, use a combing tool.
Once you've finished your design, let the paint dry for 24 hours and do not wash your fabric for 72 hours after painting.

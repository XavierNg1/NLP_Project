Start with an equation for velocity in terms of displacement.
Take the equation's derivative.
Replace "s" with "ds/dt.",
Plug in a t value for your new equation to find instantaneous velocity.
Graph your object's displacement over time.
Choose one point P and a point Q that is near it on the line.
Find the slope between P and Q.
Repeat several times, moving Q nearer to P. Your goal here is to make the distance between P and Q smaller and smaller until it gets close to a single point.
Estimate the slope for an infinitely small interval on the line.
Find the instantaneous velocity at t = 4 given the displacement equation s = 5t3 - 3t2 + 2t + 9.
Use graphical estimation to find the instantaneous velocity at (1,3) for the displacement equation s = 4t2 - t. For this problem, we'll use (1,3) as our P point, but we'll have to find a few other points near it to use as our Q points.

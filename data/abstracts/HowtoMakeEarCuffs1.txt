Use the string to measure out the width of your ear where you want the cuff.
Cut about 20 cm of thin wire and smooth the edges with the nail file.
Grip the end of the wire with the pliers, then turn it into a small circular hook.
Measure out your cuff measurement (taken with the string) from the bottom of the circle.
Bend the wire back on itself at your measurement.
Bend the wire into a zig-zag, bending the wire back where it is even with your hook.
Use your pliers to create another hook right at the last bend of the wire.
Cut off the excessive wire so you have hooks on both ends of the wire.
Mold your ear cuff around a large pen or Sharpie to bend it.

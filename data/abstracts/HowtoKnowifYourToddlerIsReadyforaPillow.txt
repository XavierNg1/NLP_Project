Check with your child's pediatrician.
Consider your child's age.
Educate yourself.
Decide if your child shows signs of readiness for a pillow.
If your child is at least 1Â½ years old and your pediatrician says it's okay to introduce a pillow AND you believe your child is ready, research the various options for toddler pillows that are in proportion to your child's head/neck.

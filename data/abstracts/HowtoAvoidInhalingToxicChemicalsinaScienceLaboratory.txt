Make sure the assigned lab table you are working on is sterile.
Use clean gloves, goggles, and a clean lab coat at all times when in a science lab.
Be aware of the chemicals that you are using in the lab.
Read your lab instructions carefully.
Always use your chemicals under a fume hood.The point of fume hoods are to reduce the chance of inhaling any chemicals.
When pouring chemicals from test tubes to another test tube, give yourself a good distance to a point where you can see the the liquid transferring but also distance enough to where you cannot inhale it.

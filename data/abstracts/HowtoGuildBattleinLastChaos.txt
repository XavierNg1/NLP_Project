To challenge another Guild, the Challenger must issue a challenge to the Challenged via the Action menu (alt-G), by selecting the Challenged and selecting ‘Apply for Guild Battle’.
When challenging, the Challenger must specify the stake and also specify the number of minutes the Guild Battle will last.
Once the challenge is accepted by both Guilds, members of both Guilds will have a scoreboard appear on the right of their screens.
The winning Guild is the Guild whose members kill the highest number opponents within the Guild Battle duration.

Get a coat button that you find pretty or interesting.
Turn the bobby pin over so that the side you plan on wearing outward is facing you.
Slip the button over the tip of the bobby pin.
Slide the button all the way down to the other end of the bobby pin.
Secure the button with a drop or two of hot glue or super glue.
Let the glue dry completely before you wear the bobby pin.

Choose your favorite bacon.
Drape you bacon on your rack.
Cover your bacon with a paper towel to prevent spattering, if you wish.
Put your bacon in the microwave and set it to cook.
Toward the end of cooking you will hear the sizzle slow, just as in popping popcorn in the microwave.
Carefully remove your bacon and place it on a dish to serve.

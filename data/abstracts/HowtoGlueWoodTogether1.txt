Decide if your project is right for normal white glue.
Purchase a white, polyvinyl acetate glue that is not meant for childrenâ€™s use.
Apply the white glue to the edge or joint of your piece with a small paintbrush.
Affix the joint or wood pieces together on a worktable or craft surface.
Place the wood between two scrap pieces of wood.
Use screw clamps, C-clamps or spring clamps.
Screw the clamps into place and allow excess glue to press out of the areas where the wood pieces meet.
Clamp for at least two hours, but give most projects overnight to cure.

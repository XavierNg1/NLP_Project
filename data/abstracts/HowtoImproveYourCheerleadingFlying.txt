If you are a beginner, try stepping into your stunt first.
If you are intermediate or advanced, you can jump into your stunt.
To come down from your stunt, either grab your frontspotter's hands(if you have one) or your bases' hands(they will have to let go with one hand and rest your foot on their shoulder, so stay locked!),
You have completed a stunt, congratulations!

To take it a step further, you can "cradle" down from your stunt instead.

Seize opportunities to play together.
Play what your siblings want to play, but don't be afraid to compromise with them.
Plan special events that you can do together, like camping out in the living room or going to the swimming pool.
If they are little, go easy on them.
Let your siblings think they're smart.
Don't be afraid of what people might think, just because you're playing with siblings.

Love your sibling.
Try to have some alone time once a week, whether it's going out for lunch together or sitting down and watching a movie or your favorite cartoon.

Play the "I Love You" game with toddlers.
Randomly grab them into a hug.

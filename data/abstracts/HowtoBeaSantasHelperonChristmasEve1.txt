Your parents or the parents of a child you're staying with will probably give you a certain job.
If you are going to have to have a job to do on Christmas Eve, try to find out as far beforehand as possible.
If you do have time to prepare, this is what you should do, depending on your job:

Job 1: No preparation necessary






Job 2: Get the kids to bed at least a few times beforehand.
Get to know the kids you will be with.
Make sure you know your jobs hazards and the good sides.

Spend time getting to know your horse.
Turn your horse out into a large enclosed arena or pasture and watch his movements.
Talk to your horse.
Understand when your horse wants space, and make sure your horse understands your boundaries.

,
Make sure your horse is aware of the fact that you call the shots.
Teach basic commands.
Don't jump straight into riding.
Try teaching the horse some easy tricks.
Work on leading your horse with a neck rope or a loose rope halter.
Once you have accomplished getting the horse to lead with you at your side, without you needing to pull or constantly ask, take off the rope and start working with him without the rope.
When you feel you are connected with your horse more, try riding again.
Try having the horse walk with you around cones and over poles.
Notice the change over time.
When you feel you are comfortable with where you are with your horse, stretch the boundaries, to achieve more.
Continue striving to make a good bond.

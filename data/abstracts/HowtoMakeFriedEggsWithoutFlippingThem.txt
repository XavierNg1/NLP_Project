Place a pan on an even burner and begin with a burner temperature just below medium heat.
Within a few minutes of turning the burner on, spray olive oil (see the tips section on this) or place three tablespoons of melted butter into the bottom of the pan.
Allow the pan to heat, but not so much as to cause the oil or butter to burn.
Break the first egg into a small dish or bowl and then lower the dish into the hot pan and gently pour the egg into the pan.
Continue to break up to three eggs, one at a time, into the dish and transfer them to the pan.
After one or two minutes of cooking, take the cover for the pan and run approximately one to two tablespoons of tap water into its underside.
Observe the hardness of the yolk by lifting the pan lid from time to time.
Use the spatula (and this is the first and only time you should have to use the spatula) and gently lift the eggs out onto a plate.

Make sure you have that person's MSN.
Start a conversation with them when they sign on.
Ask them what they have been doing that day or have been doing in general.
Tell them what you have been doing.
Say you have to go when the conversation slows down.
Wait a few days and then speak to them again.
Progress the conversations for a few weeks.
Continue to go out places with them, soon you will be best friends.

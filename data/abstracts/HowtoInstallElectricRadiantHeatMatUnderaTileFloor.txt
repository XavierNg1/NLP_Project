Prepare your floor for tile by installing tile backer board on the floor, securing it to the existing sub-floor with thin-set mortar and cement board screws or nails.
Make a scale drawing of the bathroom floor, including toilet, tub and vanity locations, and bring it to the tile store or home center so you can buy the proper size mat or combination of mats.
Check the wiring with a continuity tester, after purchasing the mat, to make sure it wasn’t damaged during manufacturing or shipping.

,
Install an electrical outlet box 5 feet (1.5 m).
Note: following your preliminary layout, you should mark the path of the thick “power lead” between the mat and wall cavity and chisel a shallow trench into the floor.
Draw the layout lines for the tile on the floor.
Install the mat, securing it lightly to the cement board with double-face tape.
Check the mat wiring again with the continuity tester.

,
Install conduit connectors to both ends of two pieces of 1/2-in.
Spread the mortar over a 5- to 10-sq.-ft. area of floor.
Lay the tile, then tap it firmly into place.
Connect the power lead and thermostat wire to the thermostat, following manufacturer's instructions.

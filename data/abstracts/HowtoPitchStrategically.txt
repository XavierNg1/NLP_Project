Start off a lot of batters the first time around with a fastball low and away.
If they hit the first pitch, it will probably be a weak grounder.
If they hit that last one, it was probably a weak grounder, a solid grounder, or a pop-up.
After these three pitches early on, you can toy with the batter.

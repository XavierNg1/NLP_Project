Play the Macarena.
Start on the third eight count.
Count with the music.
Put your right arm straight in front of you with your palm down on 1.
On 3, flip your right hand over.
On 5, grab or just touch your left shoulder with your right hand.
Slide your right hand underneath your left arm and touch the right side of your head on 7.
Put your right hand on your left hip on 1.
On 3, place your right hand on the right side of your booty.
Roll your hips 3 times -- to the right, to the left, and to the right once more on 5, 6, and 7.
Repeat!,
If you want to really get into it, pulse your shoulders and hips lightly with each beat.

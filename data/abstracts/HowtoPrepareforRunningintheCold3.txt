Staying warm is imperative to a good workout when running in cold weather, so you lessen your likelihood of straining or pulling muscles when you run.
Layer your shirts and pants.
Wear a beanie or wear a hat that covers the head and ears.
Purchase hand warmers at a sporting goods store and invest in some very warm lightweight gloves.

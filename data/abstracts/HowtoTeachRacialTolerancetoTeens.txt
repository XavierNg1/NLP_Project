Never discourage curiosity.
Examine your own behavior first.
Racism, like other prejudices, often stems from ignorance and fear of the unknown.
Show them the hard, cold facts.
Teach good ways to show curiosity about another culture.
Tell kids about things that are definite no-nos.
If your kid has ever been discriminated against, help them recognize that stereotypes exist no matter what, where, with who, or how.
Keep an eye out for popular stereotypes being glamorized by the media.
If peer pressure is the problem, help them see that bullies are often just scared and resentful inside.

First, ask your parents to let you switch to public/private school.
Pick the closest High School near you.
After picking a school make sure you register.
Now all that's left is getting your stuff.
Before attending the school try to get to know some of the kids that go to your school, and even if you aren't best friends still talk to them from time to time.
Once you get to the school check in at the front desk, and ask for your schedule, your locker number and combination (have someone show you how to open your locker since lots of homeschooled children don't know how they work), and request someone to show you around.
Now have a little heart to heart with your teachers.

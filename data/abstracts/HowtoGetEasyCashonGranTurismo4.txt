First, since you have only 10,000 credits, get a decent car to race with, just find a car with around 250 horsepower.
Go to the Special Conditions Races near the bottom left of the GT mode menu.

,
Choose the second one down.
There are only two races, and each have 2 laps.
Once you do both races (the track forwards and backwards) you will have won 10,000 credits of prize money and a Toyota RSC Rally Car.
Congratulations!,
Repeat if more cash is wanted.

Bend notes for a bluesy, well-articulated pitch.
Practice "landing" your bends on the same note one, two, or three frets down.
Skip strings to create sudden jumps in pitch and spice up solos.
Use slides to quickly and seamlessly move up and down the neck.
Hammer on to other notes to quickly sound them out without having to pick.
Use pull-offs as in inverse of a hammer-on, picking a note with your fretting hand.
Flutter your fretting finger with a small, back and forth bend to get vibrato.
Add in several "wrong" notes to your scales to explore chromaticism.
Work on "harmonic picking" to create a high-pitched, clear tone on a note, known as a harmonic.
Create natural harmonics by lightly draping your fretting finger right over a fret, not pushing down, when it is picked.

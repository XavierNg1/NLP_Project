Wait until your parents aren't home, are asleep, or are in their room.
Go to the kitchen, or wherever the snacks are.
Get the snacks you want.
Sneak them up to your room.
Put them in a drawer or a place where your parents won't find them.
Save them for a time you need them, like staying up late at night.
Always vacuum or sweep up any crumbs or leftovers from your snacks, otherwise it will attract insects and rodents.

Look at these similar triangles, and therefore the proportionÂ {DG}/{DH}={DE}/{DF}.
To multiply x times y, make horizontal line DH of length 1, extend DF of length x from DH and raise DG of length y at an angle above horizontal DF.
To divide y by x, make DH of length 1, DF of length x and DE of length y.
Suppose one stem or leaf underlying another, in its shadow.
Suppose crossing roots (which they do) and suppose some sensitivity to one another -- could this be a way plants perform math and send vital nutrients on a timely basis up the plants?,
Suppose neurons branching at various angles in the brain (which they do) -- could this be a way of computation of p/n = A.E.N.Descartes also used the next proposition, VI.13, to take square roots geometrically.
If it can be done geometrically, then can Mother Nature perform it within reasonable tolerances?,

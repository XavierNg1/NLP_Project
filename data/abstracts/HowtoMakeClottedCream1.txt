Preheat your oven to 180° F (82° C).
Get high fat, not ultra-pasteurized cream if at all possible.
Pour any amount of cream into a heavy-bottomed pot with a lid.
Place the cream-filled pot in the pre-heated oven and cook for at least 8 hours.
Remove the pan with the clotted cream from the oven and let cool at room temperature.
Separate the clotted cream on top from the whey-like liquid below.
Enjoy!

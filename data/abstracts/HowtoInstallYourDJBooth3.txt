Unpack your equipment First up we need to remove everything from it's boxes.
Place the items on a flat surface You always want to place your DJ equipment on a flat and sturdy surface.
Decide on a Layout You need to decide how you will lay out your equipment.
Connect the turntables to the mixer Each turntable should come with an RCA Cable (See above) and a Ground Cable (Cannot be removed) connect the RCA cable to the underside or back of the turntable colour coordinating red-to-red and white-to-white and connect the opposite ends the the input on the back of the mixer (NOTE: If the mixer has inputs for "Phono" and "Line" connect turntables to Phono and CD players to Line, most DJs prefer to plug the right turntable into Channel 1 and the left turntable into Channel 2 or 4).
Connect your power cables The mixes and both of your turntables will need to be plugged into AC Power.
Connect your headphones Usually the headphones plug into a jack on the front or top face of the mixer marked with a picture of headphones be sure not to plug these into the out lines on the back of the mixer.

Connect Speakers (Optional) You can listen to everything in your headphones if you like but for others to hear the music you will need speakers.
Power everything up and have fun!

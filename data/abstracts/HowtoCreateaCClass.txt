Open your IDE and make a new project.
After going through everything to set up the project, make sure your main CPP file looks like this.

,
Create.
Type the keyword "class", followed by the identifier, or name, of your class, then an open brace (which is this { character), a closing brace, and a semicolon at the end.
Understand the three main keywords inside the part called the body.
Define what the function "printstuff()" does and what "stufftoprint" is.
Inside this function, you full access to the char array "stufftoprint", so you should define that with a for loop, and then print each character along with that.
Go over to the main function and call the function.
Call the function printstuff().
Run it, wait for it to compile... and 5 Qs appeared on the screen (just as you defined the function printstuff() contained in the class myclass, accessing it with the object myobject).

Cut a piece of fabric that is about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wide and 18 inches (45.72 centimeters) long.For a plain scrunchie, use some cotton or jersey-knit fabric.
Fold it lengthways, right side in.
Sew along the long, raw edge using a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance.
Turn the fabric tube inside out to hide the raw edge.
Cut a 6 inch (15.24 centimeters) long piece of narrow elastic.
Attach a safety pin to each end of the elastic.
Attach one of the safety pins to one of the narrow ends of the fabric tube.
Push the elastic through the fabric tube until it comes out on the other end.
Pin the two ends of the elastic together.
Sew the two ends of the elastic together using tiny stitches and a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance.
Tuck the narrow, raw edges of the fabric tube inside by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters).
Bring the two narrow ends together, and sew them to each other using a ladder stitch.Sew all the way around the edges; be careful not to sew through the elastic.
Finished.

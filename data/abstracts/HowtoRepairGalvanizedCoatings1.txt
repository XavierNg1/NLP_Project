Be sure that you have the Galvanite Instructions and be sure to read them. ,
Pre-clean the parent metal.
Use a soft flame, heat gun or soldering iron to heat the parent metal repair area to at least 600°F/315°C.
Hold the torch tip 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) away from the parent metal.
Drag the rod over the area to be soldered, until it begins to flow.
Blend the repair into the undamaged galvanized coating.
Observe the solder deposit.
If you stopped soldering and want to apply more solder or flow out the deposit more, let the area cool below the solid temperature and reheat.
Smooth the repair area and remove any excess solder with a wire brush.

Repeat these steps to build up additional layers of protection.

Research.
Listen.
Acknowledge.
Find out why your relative is depressed.
Try to understand.
Don't tell your elderly relative that life is still worth living and that this situation will improve and the sadness will get better.
Be patient.
Advise them to seek professional help.
Bottom line (and this is from a depression sufferer): This is an evil disease.
The best thing I heard during one depression period was from a friend who sincerely and simply said "Man, I feel so bad for you."

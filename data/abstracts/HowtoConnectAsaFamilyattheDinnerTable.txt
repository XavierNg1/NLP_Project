Try to set a time to eat dinner when all family members will be home.
Give each member a task.
Once dinner is ready and everyone has taken their seat at the table (a good time to say Grace if you prefer), the conversation can begin.
After dinner, have everyone pitch in and help even if they just empty their own plates the clean up will be easier for all.

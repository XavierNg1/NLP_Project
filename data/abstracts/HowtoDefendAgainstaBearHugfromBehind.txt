Make sure your assailant is an enemy.
Drop your weight below your opponent's center of gravity.
Figure out whether your arms are free or caught by the bear-hug.
Attack.
If your arms are free, stomp the feet and elbow the stomach and the head.
Hit the back of the enemy's hand with the two knuckles you would use to tap a table.
Don't stop part way.

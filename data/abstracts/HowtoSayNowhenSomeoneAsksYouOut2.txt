Go with your gut.Although you should give just about anyone a chance to prove themselves, being approached by a stranger in a public place usually relies on spontaneous decision making.
Give a straightforward rejection.You can always just say "No.",
Leave no room for interpretation.If someone asks you out, a more persistent sort may try to analyze what you've said and look for loopholes.
Offer an excuse.
Resist the urge to apologize.
Let the other person have the last word.If you're talking to a stranger, egos can come into play.

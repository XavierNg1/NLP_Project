Invite your friends, around 5-8 people is enough.
Plan!,
Think about food.
Put up decorations.
Even if you have the most fun things planned, being a good host(ess) will always make things that extra bit more fun!,
Most of the time, the most relaxed parties, which go with the flow, are the most fun.

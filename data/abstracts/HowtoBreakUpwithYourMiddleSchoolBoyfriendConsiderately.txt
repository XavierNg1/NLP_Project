Decide whether breaking up is the best idea or not.
Think it through.
Observe some common courtesy.
Decide on a date and stick with it.

,
Slowly slope off answering calls and texts as you approach the dreaded date.
Start asking for your stuff back, if he has any.
If you're going to ask people for advice on how to break up, be decent and only talk to people you trust.
Don't give him the cold shoulder prior to breaking up.
Break up in person, unless you are in a long-distance relationship.
Don't do it at school.
Never start the conversation with "I need to talk to you" or "I think I might want to break up with you.",
Be straightforward.
Give him reasons why, but only if he asks.
Don't feel that you need to comfort him.
Do not suggest that you remain friends unless you and he are breaking up amicably and he understands your reasoning.
Tell himÂ you hope he understands, but do not apologize.
Don't drag out the conversation.
Call him when you know he is home and awake.

,
If it goes to voicemail, you're lucky.
Say that you need to tell him something.

,
Tell him you are breaking up with him and tell him why.

,
As stated earlier, it is not your responsibility to comfort him extensively.
When you're finished, hang up.

,
Forget about him for at least a month.
If you didn't ask for all of your stuff back before you broke up, ask him for the items he still has.
Don't spread the news, but if someone asks, tell them the truth.
Expect unfriendliness from some.
Expect a sense of loss.
Look for someone else, if you're interested.

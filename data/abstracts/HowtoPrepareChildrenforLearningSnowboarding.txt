Do not allow any child under 7 to snowboard.
Get your child kitted out in protective gear.
Talk to your child about the potential problems that might be encountered:


Ask your child to be aware of others on the hill at all times, and make it clear that collisions hurt but are avoidable if your child remains alert.
Find suitable instruction for your child.
Do not use hills that exceed your child's beginner ability.

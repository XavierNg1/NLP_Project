Look back at your relationship.
Watch out if your partner is suddenly going out.
Take note if the person you're with is acting weird or is suddenly jealous of everything and everyone, something is definitely going on.
Take note if your partner suggest you're cheating on him/her and you are not, then it most probably means he/she is.
Find out for sure.
Know that you are at risk.
If for some reason he/she confesses to have been cheating, let him/her go.
Keep in mind that you may see it with your own eyes.
Do not ever go back to a cheater and try not to connect yourself to a former cheater.

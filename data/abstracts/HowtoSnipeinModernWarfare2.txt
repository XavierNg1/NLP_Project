Set up a class for how you're going to play, there are different types of Sniping.
At the beginning of the game you don't want to rush the enemy by going to their spawn point at the beginning - you'll just get yourself killed.
Once you see someone, take your time to shoot them, especially if you're new to Sniping, It doesn't matter if you get more deaths than kills, practice makes perfect.

Most people use the Intervention or Barrett because these guns are powerful and help get one-hit kills.
Play in Ground War or Team Death-match.
If you come up against a more experienced sniper, leave the area.

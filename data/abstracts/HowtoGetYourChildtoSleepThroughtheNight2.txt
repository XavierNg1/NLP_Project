Have a plan for middle-of-the-night disturbances.If your child has been waking up in the middle of the night, it is important that you (and your partner) discuss a plan in advance for how you will handle these outbursts when they arise.
Do not invite your child into your bed.When their child has trouble sleeping through the night, some parents resort to inviting the child to sleep in their bed.
Do not rock your child back to sleep.Another coping pattern that parents may resort to is rocking their child back to sleep.
Avoid reinforcing negative behaviors such as crying.If your child cries in the middle of the night, ideally you would ignore her and allow her to self-soothe until she falls back to sleep.
Remain focused on the long-term goal.When it comes to a child who cannot sleep through the night, it is easy to become distressed and disillusioned with the challenges of the moment.

Pour a small amount of 90% isopropyl alcohol or spray the hairspray directly on the stain.
Blot the stain with a clean absorbent cloth or cotton ball.
Rinse the jeans with cold water to remove the alcohol or hairspray after the ink is no longer visible.
Launder the jeans in cold water in a washing machine.

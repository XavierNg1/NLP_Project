Cut through the lawn surrounding the sprinkler head, about 6 inches (15.2Â cm) all the way around, using a serrated knife or dirt shovel with a point on the end.
Pry up the section of turf using a hand trowel or small shovel (about 2-3 inches thick) and set the turf aside to replace later.

,
Carefully dig away the dirt surrounding the sprinkler head.
Once you have cleared all the way down to the riser (a short vertical pipe connected to the water-supply pipe), unscrew the old sprinkler body and remove it.
Take the old sprinkler body to the store, and buy a new sprinkler body that is the same size as the old one.
Wrap a thin coating of Teflon tape around the threaded male end of the riser (Teflon tape is available in the plumbing section of any home-improvement store).
Turn on the sprinkler line for just a moment to blow out any dirt that may have fallen into the line.

,
Turn off the sprinklers, then using the flush-plug ring, pull up the riser, unscrew the flush-plug, put in the plastic filter screen and screw on the nozzle.

,
Twist the nozzle to align the spray pattern so it sprays onto the lawn, not the surrounding area.
Replace the dirt back into the hole, packing it down around the sprinkler body.

,
Replace the turf and push it down around the sprinkler head.

,
Turn on the sprinklers to check that everything is spraying correctly.

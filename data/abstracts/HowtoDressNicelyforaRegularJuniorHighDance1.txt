Be feminine, but comfortable.
Wear Jeans or Shorts!,
Wear comfortable shoes or your feet will stop you from having any fun!,
Wear some fun jewelry that coordinates with your clothes.
Don't wear long sleeves, or sweaters, because it gets hot in there with so many people dancing!

,
The most important thing is to be yourself and just have fun!

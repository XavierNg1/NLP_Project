Obsess over horror movies: Sunako loves to watch and admire her favorite horror movie characters.
Appreciate anything strange: This includes anything out of the ordinary, anything scary, or anything Gothic.
Hate the heat: Since Sunako is from Hokkaido, she hates the heat and sunlight.
Stand your ground: Like Sunako, you need to be able to stand up for yourself and defend your friends.
Be motivated: In the series, Sunako rarely ever gives up; once she decides to do something she will do it no matter what.
Try to be a loner: Chances are if you’re Gothic you might not be with the ‘it’ crowd, since many of them are narrow minded.
Dislike the chronically beautiful: Throughout the series the Gothic heroine detests how “radiant” Kyohei and the other bishounen in her aunt’s mansion are.
Have some talents: It can be anything – art, writing, sports, acting, or whatever else you are good at.

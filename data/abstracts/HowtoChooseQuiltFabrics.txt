Know the names used for quilt fabric textures, colours and designs.
Choose plain, quality fabrics for large parts of the quilt.
Choose solid fabrics when the print isn't important as part of the overall quilt design.
Select prints according to the quilt design and pattern.
For monochromatic quilting, choose some of the following:


Tone on tone prints: These are good for creating texture on the quilt and will tend to look plain when viewed from afar.
Use reproduction fabrics if you're trying to make a vintage looking quilt.
Add novelty prints for fun.
Use blender fabrics when you want to match between different fabric types.
Always put swatches of fabric color combinations together before proceeding to make your quilt.

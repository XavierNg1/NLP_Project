Decide how much money you are willing to spend.
Decide what you want to get.
If you only want to use the amp to practice in your room, look for a combo amp with about 20-30 watts of power.
If you want to use the amp for practicing with a band, you're going to want 60-140 watts of power.
If you want to use the amp for small to medium gigs, you should buy a half-stack with about 200-600 watts of power.

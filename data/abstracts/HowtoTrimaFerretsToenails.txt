Before you get started, familiarize yourself with your ferrets paw.
Place a towel across your lap.
Use a sharp pair of nail trimmers and clip off the excess nail, cutting at the correct angle so that the new flat tip of the toenail will be parallel to the floor when the ferret is standing.
Alternative to ferretone (this may not work with a very squirmy or fat ferret): Place your hand on the back of the neck of your ferret.
Finished.

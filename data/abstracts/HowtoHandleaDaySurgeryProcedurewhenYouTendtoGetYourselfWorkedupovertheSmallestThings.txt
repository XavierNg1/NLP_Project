Calm yourself before you go to the hospital/clinic.
If you are afraid of needles, then apply an Emla patch 1-2 hours before.
Bring things that comfort you.
While you're waiting think of things other than the procedure.
When the doctor sticks the needle in: Breathe deeply.
By now you should be numb.
When the doctor stitches you, try not to think about it.
Take it slow.

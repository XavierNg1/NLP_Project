Quarantine your hermit crab, if possible.If you’re introducing a new crab to another crab, or a whole population of other crabs, you should place it in a separate tank for a few weeks.
Choose the right tank.When it comes to tanks, the bigger the better.
Install a substrate.Crabs need a natural substrate to dig and hide in.
Maintain your tank’s climate.

Inventory potential roach habitats in your home.
Check these areas for infestation.
Note any areas roaches would live, feed, or lay eggs.
Check areas roaches may live for unpleasant smells.
Clean areas of any food debris or standing water.

React excess hydrochloric acid (muriatic acid) with Borax to produce boric acid and salt water.
Filter out the boric acid crystals.
Take the borax or boric acid and place it in a container.
Sprinkle or spray the borax or boric acid on target areas.
Remove electrical outlet covers, dust inside the walls with borax.
Cover any noted areas with a light dusting of insecticide.
Sprinkle the borax or boric acid, dry, on any carpet or rug.

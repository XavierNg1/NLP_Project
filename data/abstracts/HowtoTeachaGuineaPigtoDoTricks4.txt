Get a small garbage can or round, cylinder-shaped object of some sort.
Place your guinea pig in the general area.
Use a treat to lure your guinea pig to it.
Stand back and see if the guinea pig will try to go around on its own.
Eventually, begin only treating your guinea pig when they make a full circle around the object.
Begin enforcing a hand motion.
Take the garbage can away gradually.

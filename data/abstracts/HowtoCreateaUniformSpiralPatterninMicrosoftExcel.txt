The column formulas are as follows:


B7: "=IF(EVEN(S_COUNT)=S_COUNT,ROUND((-B4*PI())+(Adj),0),top)"
B8;B1447: "=((B7+(-TOP*2)/(AdjRows)))*$B$1"
C7: "=ROUND(-EXP((PI()^2)+(Cc*-(db))),0)+Designer"
C8:C1447: "=C7"
D7:D1447: "=IF(A7=0,D6,DEGREES((ROW()-7))*COS((ROW()-7)*Factor*PI()/(180))/Divisor)" which looks new.
Create the charts.
Remove Axis, Grid lines and Chart Legend for both charts in Chart Layout.

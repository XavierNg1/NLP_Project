Address the need that makes you stim harmfully.
Make a list of stims that could fulfill the same need.
Use harm reduction for seriously damaging stims.
If you use the harmful stim unconsciously, find ways to remind yourself when you're doing it.
As soon as you notice yourself using the harmful stim, switch to the new stim.

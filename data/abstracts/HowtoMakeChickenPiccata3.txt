Take your chicken breasts and dip them in milk ahead of time for a thicker breading.
Add a cup of heavy cream to the sauce, stirring until well mixed, before the chicken goes back in.
Ignore the capers if you're not feeling like the olive-y bite.
Chop some shallots or garlic into the pan just before deglazing to add a hint of new flavors to the sauce.
Finished.

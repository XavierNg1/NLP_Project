You will need a little bit of oil (after-run oil, multipurpose oil, etc.).Start with the carburetor.Take all of your small pieces and start with the barrel.Put a small bit of oil on there and stick it back in.
Replace the Barrel.Now, take your barrel spring – take your fingernail and help run it right over the lip that it attaches to.Pull it over, hold it down, and run your finger around the carburetor and it should lock in place.Now you can take your seal or boot which goes over all of that – get the edge of the boot over the lip for a nice, tight seal.
Next, take your throttle arm and put it back on.Tighten the set screw and it should lock in place for you.
Next up – the high speed needle.
Now go on to the engine block.
Take your piston and rod assembly and put a drop of oil on the top and on the big end.Be patient….
Next, oil the piston sleeve and replace it.
Now that the rotating assembly is in, it’s time to put the back plate back on.
Reinstall the Back Plate and put the starter shaft in.Don’t forget the small Teflon washer!,
Stick the head shim right on top of the cooling head.Take a tool and make sure that you can get it down to the mounting hose with the notches lined up with the bolt holes.Put in the five screws in a criss-cross pattern.
Put in your carburetor bolts, take your carburetor and spin it a little bit to line it up.Tighten it down and there you have it!

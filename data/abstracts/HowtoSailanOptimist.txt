Obtain all of the equipment needed (a rudder, dagger board, sail, mast, boom, and spirit pole etc).
Assemble the sail.
Launch the boat.
Position yourself on the rail so that you are facing the bow (the smaller end) of the boat.
Get hold of tiller extension with the hand closest to the stern (back) of the boat and hold it as if it is a microphone.
Make sure the sail is always trimmed (adjusted) so that it will catch the wind.

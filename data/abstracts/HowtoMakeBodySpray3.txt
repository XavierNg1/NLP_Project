Get a 5 to 6-ounce (150 to 180-milliliter spray bottle.
Place a funnel into the mouth of the bottle.
Pour 3 teaspoons of argan oil into the bottle.If you can't find any argan oil, or if you can't afford it, try jojoba oil instead.
Add 2 teaspoons of loose eyeshadow or cosmetic pigment powder.The powder likely will get caught in the funnel, which is fine.
Pour 2 ounces (60 milliliters) of distilled water down the funnel.This will help knock loose any eyeshadow/pigment powder that got caught in the mouth of the funnel.
Consider adding some fragrance.
Close the bottle and shake it.

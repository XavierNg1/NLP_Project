Start and ride the motorcycle.
Set the piston at Top Dead Center just as you do to start the motorcycle.
Open the tappet cover and remove the spindle that holds it.
Try rotating each push rod with your thumb.
Back off the lock nut on the valve you want to adjust.
Put one wrench on the top adjustment nut to hold it still.

Rinse off the retainer to remove any visible buildup.
Place the retainer in a shallow cup, and fill with enough denture cleaner to cover the retainer completely.
Let your retainer soak in the denture cleaner liquid for 15 to 20 minutes, or as instructed by packaging.
Submerge the retainer in non-alcoholic mouthwash for anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours.
Remove the retainer after the allotted time and rinse.

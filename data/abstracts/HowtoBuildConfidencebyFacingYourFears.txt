Practice reacting aggressively and positively towards fears in your imagination: Do this every time fear creeps into your imagination.
Take risks and set out to do what your heart desires.
"Act as if it were impossible to fail.",
Relax your fear away.
Substitute the feeling of fear with another "positive, feel good" feeling: Think about anything that strikes the chord and leaves you with a pleasant taste.

Being anonymous is essential for an assassin.
Try to remain anonymous by avoiding high profile actions near guards.
When you become noticed, you can blend in or hide to cut the line of sight.
You can throw money to attract citizens and distract guards in order to easily get into the guarded places.
Higher level guards such as Brutes, Agiles, Seekers... will not be affect by thrown money.

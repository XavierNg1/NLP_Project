Read the small print on your home insurance policy carefully â€“ ideally do this before the damage occurs so you know you're properly covered.
Keep proof of purchase of all items valued at over $200, wherever possible.
Complete a written inventory of all your household goods on an annual basis.
In the absence of the above-mentioned evidence as proof of ownership, or as supporting evidence, take photos of your valuables with serial numbers.

Start with neatly brushed hair.
Start with your hair parted down the center.
Slip the end of a rat-tail comb through your hair either to the left or right of the part.
Slid the comb towards the opposite side of your head, past the central part.
Touch up the side part.
Set the side part with some hairspray.

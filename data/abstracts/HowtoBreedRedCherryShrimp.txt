Set up your tank.
Buy a master test kit.
Purchase 5-10 red cherry shrimp.
Fill your tank with water that you have added dechlorinator to.
Get the shrimp used to the water using these steps.
Dump the shrimp in the tank.
Set your heater to about 80F or 27C.
Feed the shrimp flake food, sinking pellets, or blanched squash or zucchini.
If water temperature is warm enough and there is enough food, they will simply breed.
Maintain the tank.

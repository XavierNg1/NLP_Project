Stand Still - If a strange dog comes running towards you, your first instinct is probably to run the other way.
Do not make eye contact with the dog.
Ignore the dog if it jumps up - A dog running towards you may attempt to jump up on you.
If the dog knocks you over, curl up in a ball - Larger breeds of dogs may be capable of knocking you over.

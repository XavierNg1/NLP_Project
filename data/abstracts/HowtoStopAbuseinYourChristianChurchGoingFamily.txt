Realize that Christ is against abuse in the family.
Be prepared for resistance.
Ask for help.
Notice what's happening.
Speak up.
Educate yourself.
Stay safe.
Recognize abuse.
If the abusive person in your life says or does something that hurts your feelings or puts you down, you must immediately begin saying, "Please don't say that to me, that hurts my feelings," or "please do not treat me like that.",
Examine your life and find one behavior between you and your Partner or the Emotionally abusive person that you want to change and work for the next three weeks on changing that behavior.
Continually use the above steps to make continual improvements in your Family's domestic life.
Talk to your Spouse or Partner or the Abusive Family Member as calmly as possible, if you believe you can do so safely without retribution and tell them that because you love them and want to continue improving your relationship - there are things you need to do to change both of your lives.

Be Born Again as the scripture said: "Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and abides for ever: But the word of the Lord endures for ever.
Repent of your wrongdoing, called "sin".
Receive the words of the Bible as being "by inspiration of God," and "not" as words of man and always read and understand before you practice it.
Believe what the Bible tells you about: "Who is God and how He is to His people?"

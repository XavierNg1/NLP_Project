Identify the values of a, b, and c. In a quadratic equation, the x2 term = a, the x term = b, and the constant term (the term without a variable) = c. Let's say you're working with the following equation: y = x2 + 9x + 18.
Use the vertex formula for finding the x-value of the vertex.
Plug the x-value into the original equation to get the y-value.
Write down the x and y values as an ordered pair.

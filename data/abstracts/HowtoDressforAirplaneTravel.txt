First things first - it's not a catwalk.
Mix and match.
Wear a comfy outfit and dressier accessories, like a fashionable carry on bag or nice jewellery.

,
Try to think about things like going through security.
Don't wear awkward things like high heels, as stepping onto the plane might be pretty tricky and you'll have less chance of escape if you have to get out in a hurry.

,
Wearing or carrying things with offensive slogans or images isn't recommended.
And lastly, if you don't want to use any of these tips and you just want to wear a tracksuit and trainers, that's cool too!

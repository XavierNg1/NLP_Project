Use the tinted 1-2-3 primer and paint the kitchen again from top to bottom.

When the paint has dried use the 2 pack filler to fill up any little holes or dents.
Give the kitchen 2 finish coats, for best results.
When the finish coat has dried, give it a really good rub down with the 240 grade sandpaper, then dust off and rub down with a damp rag.
Use the caulk to fill any gaps you might find.
Apply the finish coat!

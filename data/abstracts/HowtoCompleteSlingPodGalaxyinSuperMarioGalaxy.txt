 

Begin by Beating Trantnox in Space Junk Galaxy.





When you return to the Observatory, a Hungry Luma will appear right by the fountain.





Once you have progressed enough, you will have to use pull stars!,





If you are almost to the star, beware!,





Right after you hit the star, you completed the mission!

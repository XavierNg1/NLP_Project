Educate yourself.
See as many artworks as possible.
Go to China.
Seek out hand-painted artworks in the mid-range market.
Research the artist.
Be mindful of quality.
Don't compete with wealthy non-Chinese art collectors.
If you see something that you like, grab it before it is gone.
Watch your budget.
Enjoy yourself!

Think about just how long you have been friends.
If you have already established your feelings for one another, good job and skip this step.
Move forward in your relationship.
Start out slow.
Remember that certain habits may NOT be continued on into this new relationship.
Don't be afraid to ask them what things they like or don't like.
You may already know their family, assuming you have been best friends long enough.
Rules about phone calls do not apply to you as a couple.
Treat yourselves like you really are a couple.

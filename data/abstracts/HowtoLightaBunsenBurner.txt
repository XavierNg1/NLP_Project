Ensure that you have a clean and uncluttered work area.
Check to make sure that all of your equipment is clean and is in good working order.
Know where the safety equipment is located and how to use it.
Dress for safety.
Make sure there are no cracks in the gas supply line, which is usually a rubber hose/tubing.
Connect the supply hose to the gas main and to the Bunsen burner.
Get in the habit of only handling the burner at the bottom.
Learn the nomenclature for the parts of Bunsen burner.
Learn the parts of the flame.
Learn the specifics of the gas mixing and combustion processes.
Make sure that the collar near the bottom of the barrel is positioned so that the air ports are nearly closed.
Make sure that your local supply valve is closed and the laboratory gas main is on.
Close the needle valve at the bottom of the burner.
Open the local gas valve by turning the handle so that it is in line (parallel) to the outlet.

,
Hold your striker just above (1-2" or 3-5cm) above the top of the barrel and squeeze the striker to create a spark.Once the burner is lit, put the striker away.
The needle valve on the bottom of the Bunser burner adjusts the gas flow rate and, ultimately, determines the height of the flame.
The collar controls the amount of air entering the barrel (mixing chamber) and, ultimately, determines the temperature of the flame.
Adjust to achieve the correct operating temperature for your application.
Use different parts of the flame to further adjust the temperature.
Never leave a lit Bunsen burner unattended.
Turn off the gas.
Wait for the burner to cool.
Close the needle valve by turning it clockwise.
Ensure that your burner and hose are clean and in good working order before you put them in the drawer.

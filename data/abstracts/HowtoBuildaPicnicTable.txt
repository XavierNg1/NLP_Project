Obtain a durable lumber suitable for the project.
Cut the following boards, using a rafter or speed square to scribe the correct angles:









Cut 12 2X6 boards 72 inches (183 cm) long.
Lay out the top boards on sawhorses, setting them so the best side (least knots, cracks, etc) is down, since this will be the bottom of the table top.








,
Nail the 2X4 boards with the 45 degree angle cuts to the bottom of the table top, spaced 4 inches (10 cm) from either end and the third centered between the ends.
Position the 35 inch (88,9 cm) 2X6s so they are centered over the short point of the table top end rails as shown in the photo, and nail them securely to the rails.








,
Measure up (down from the top when the table is flipped) 17 inches (43,2 cm).
Center the seat rails (also 2X6 72 inches - 183 cm - long), centered between the inverted table legs, resting on the nails you have driven in at 17 inches.
Mark the centers of both the table top middle rail and the seat rails.
Invert your table so it is now standing on its legs.
Reposition the seat boards and nail them off.
Cut the corners of the table top at a 45 degree angle about 2 inches (5 cm) from the corners so they are rounded, to make it less likely anyone will bump into them.








,
Sand and finish the table as you want.
Set your table up in a shady spot and enjoy it.

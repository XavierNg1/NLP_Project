Locate the colony (the mound will be impossible to miss), and fence this area immediately.
Treat the colony (or colonies) with individual mound treatments or baits.
For quick results, use an insecticide that can be dissolved in water (follow the directions on the container), and drench the mound with the product.
If your fire ant problem isnâ€™t too urgent, you can try using baits because they control colonies even when the mounds are not visible; however, it takes weeks to see results.
Finished.

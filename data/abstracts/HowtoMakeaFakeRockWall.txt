Hang sturdy paper on wall using a staple gun.
Put on gloves and lay down a tarp.
Apply foam to wall, leaving about 1" around the edges to allow the foam to expand (again, we will trim this later).
Once foam is dry, mix the portland in a five-gallon bucket with enough water to create a paint-like texture.
Once Portland mixture is dry, use textured spray paint to create shadows and details on your wall.
Trim paper around edges (remember the 1" we left?),
Add other props and embellishments to suit your needs.

Evaluate the space where you plan to install the floating flooring.
If your subfloor is concrete, cover it with a wood or engineered wood subfloor first.
Prepare your space.
Pick out the floating flooring.
Roll out the foam underlayment in a single layer across the floor.
Decide which way the pre-finished hardwood flooring planks will lay.
Place a 5/16 inch (7.94 mm) spacer against the wall that is the furthest away from the door.
Snap the two tongue-and-groove pieces of flooring together.
Cut the last piece in the row so it will fit, leaving a small buffer between it and any walls (for expansion or contraction).
Place the next row, but stagger the joints so that they overlap.
Continue staggering each new row until you've covered the room with the square-edge flooring.
When finished, be sure to remove the spacers from the edges of the walls.
Cut down casings when your flooring doesn't fit underneath it.
Scribe around tricky corners or angles.
Use a pull bar to help join together tongue and grooves of end pieces.

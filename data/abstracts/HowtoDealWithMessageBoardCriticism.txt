Remain calm and logical.
Be able to identify the difference between a responder that is attacking the topic (logically valid) and one that is attacking the poster (logically invalid).
Read the critique several times to make sure you completely understand the language and position of the responder and that you didn't miss critical connecting words that many times change the structure and meaning of a statement.
Do NOT stoop to their level!,
Post a reply only if they have not committed any logical fallacies.

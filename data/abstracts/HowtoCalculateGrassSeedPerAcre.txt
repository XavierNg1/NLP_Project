Learn the amount of acreage (or hectares) in the land that is to be seeded.
Check the grass seed rate on the bag or with the grass seed manufacturer.
Since one acre = 43,560 square feet, first begin dividing 1000 square feet by 43,560 to get 43.56.
Calculate the seeding rate by multiplying the number of acres (or hectares) by the pounds (kilograms) of grass seed per acre (hectare).
Know that the purpose of the seeding is also important in determining grass seed calculations.
Understand the differences between cool season and warm season grasses.
Consider attributes of the land and the species selected in order to fine-tune grass seed calculations.

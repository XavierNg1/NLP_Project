Find out what she wants, but subtly.
Use your feminine side.
Be careful of how much you pay for her present.
Make a gift for her.
Get her something that reflects a common interest.
Wrap up whatever you get her nicely.
Get her a card.
When you give her your gift, try to slide in a quick hug.
Give her the gift yourself.
Don't make a big deal of it.
Be confident.
If she likes the present, but is "not that into you" remain friends.

Cut these out.
Take the fabric you will use for the soles.
Place the sole so that the part that the straighter part lines up with the fold.Place the sole inside of the outline,
Take your sewing needle and thread.
Sew all the way around.
Choose the fabric you want to use for the top part.
Make the band or half moon big enough that you can fold the ends over to the bottom of the sole.
If you used non-slip fabric or are confident no one will slip in the slippers, you can skip this step.
Make any touch-ups you feel are necessary.

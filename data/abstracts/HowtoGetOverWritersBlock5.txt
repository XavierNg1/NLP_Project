Get a blank piece of paper.
For about five minutes, try to think of the craziest sentence possible.
Take your crazy sentence and write it down.
Repeat the process until you have a paragraph full of crazy sentences.
Pick one sentence that stands out and get inspired by it.
If none of the sentences inspire you to write a story, use the craziness itself as inspiration.

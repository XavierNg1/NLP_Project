Buy a mixed fiber tee shirt.
Buy a devorant.
Locate a very well ventilated area, near a water source.
Mix the devorant paste thoroughly.
Turn the shirt inside out.Switch the side of the tee and draw a design on that side, if you want the burnout effect to be applied to both sides of the t-shirt.
Apply the mixed devorant paste with a brush across the designs you have drawn.
Allow the devorant paste to dry completely, or use a hair drying to hurry the process along.
Warm up your iron and set up your ironing board while the paste dries.
Put a piece of scrap cloth between the t-shirt and the iron.
Soak the fabric in warm, soapy water to remove the remaining devorant paste.

Lay your bicycle down so that the side of one handlebar rests over the sheet of paper on the floor.
Remove your bike and refine the tracing, smoothing out edges and adding more seam allowance.
Place your pattern piece over the fabric and pin it in place.
If you have side mounted brake lines such as Shimano Ultegra or 105's, you will need to draw a line from your brake hoods back to your handle bar.
Pin the two sides of each mitt together.
Sew the two sides together along the top and bottom edges.Finish the seams you just sewed by either zigzagging over the raw edges or by sewing bias tape to cover the raw edges to prevent fraying.
Finish the pointed, narrow end in the same manner as above, taking care to leave enough room for that end to slide up and over the ends of your handlebars.
Turn the mitts "right side out" so that the seam allowances are to the inside.
Pin the hook and loop (aka "Velcro") strips to the edges of your brake line slit and bottom handle bar opening to form closures.
Place the mitts on your drop bars and enjoy warmer hands on your next cold ride!

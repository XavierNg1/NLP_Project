Find a rectangular piece of paper.
Fold the paper in half vertically.
Fold the two top corners to the center crease.
Fold the same corners again so the edges meet the center line.
Fold the top of the right and left sides down so they are aligned with the bottom of the body.
Finish the wings by lifting the right and left sides up.
Enjoy your paper airplane.

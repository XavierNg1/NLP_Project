Fake a throw at someoneâ€™s feet.
If your enemy throws low, dodge it.
Practice jumping and doing splits in the air to dodge low balls (if you're short), and practice rolling on the ground and getting up really fast to dodge high balls (if you're tall).
If you're a person on the larger side, then stay toward the back and let the smaller people dodge the hits.
If you have a ball in hand, use it to deflect other balls thrown at you (banned in some leagues).
Keep your eyes open for the closer opponents, but stay out of their sight.

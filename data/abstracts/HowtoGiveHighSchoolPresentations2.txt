Think positive.

,
Speak slowly, do not talk so fast that no one knows what you are saying.
The class will get hooked if your presentation excites them.
Maintain friendly and calm eye contact.
Do not agonize over mistakes â€“ don't say you're sorry.
Smile, laugh and joke, if appropriate.
To make sure everyone understands what you're talking about, ask if anyone has any questions at the end of every slide.

,
End strong.

,
The most important thing is to make sure your presentation is interesting to your class.

,
Evaluate your own presentation after delivering it.

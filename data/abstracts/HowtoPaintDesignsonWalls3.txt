Gather your supplies.
Cut shapes or designs from a piece of cardstock.
Put some double-sided tape onto the back of each shape.
Arrange the shapes in any pattern you want on your wall.
Pour some paint out.
Dip your paint roller or sponge into the paint and tap off excess paint onto a folded sheet of paper towel.
Start painting over your shapes.
Apply a second coat, if necessary.
Remove the shapes before the paint dries.
Make any touchups using extra paint and a thin paintbrush.
Allow the paint to dry fully.

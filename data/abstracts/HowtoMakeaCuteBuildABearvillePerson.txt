First, if you are just now making an account, you're going to need more bearbills.
Next go to the Bee Stylin' Salon.
Make sure to match the hairstyle to the skin tone.
If you are a girl, check out the faces that have makeup on them.
I would also recommend a hairstyle that has two different color tones in it.

Now go to the Pawlette Coufur Boutique and start looking at different clothes.
Keep in mind the season.
Accessorize.
For winter girls; Try something with boots, maybe skinny jeans tucked into them and a cute pink or purple top.

When selecting a cigar, note the "feel" of it in your fingertips.
Start by clipping the cigar about 1/2" from the tip.
Lighting a cigar is almost an art in itself.
Once the tip is glowing red, wait 45 seconds, at least.
Lightly puff the cigar, letting the smoke you draw through the stick escape from your mouth.
Puff the cigar once or twice every 60 seconds or so.
That said, now it is time for you to understand that you should be taking notes about this cigar.
Burn: Is the cigar burning regularly?,
Don't rely on any cigar to taste wonderful past the halfway point of the stick.
Give each category a rating: 1-5 stars, say.
Combine the ratings and give the cigar a final "score."

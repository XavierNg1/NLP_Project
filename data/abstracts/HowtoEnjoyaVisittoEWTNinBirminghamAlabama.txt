Plan a trip to Birmingham.
Contact the Pilgrimage department of EWTN.
Look at the website for information of activities to do there, some information of activities can be posted here too.
Some things you can do at EWTN are attending masses.
With the Friars, you can pray the Holy Rosary with them at 8:05 AM.
If you have done some sins, don't do them again.
Another awesome thing to do there is to attend EWTN's live shows on TV.

First of all, use the right wire.
Location, location, location.
Do not just drill a hole in the wall, that will look bad and crumble over time.
The simplest way to run wire is either up through an attic or down through a basement or crawl space.
Go up in the attic or down in the basement and look for your coat hangers.
Once you have drilled your hole start putting wire in it.
Go to the access hole you cut out and stuff your hand in there until you feel the wire and pull it out.

,
If you don't have an attic or basement, try hiding the wire under the baseboard.
From here, look up how to hook up a stereo, it is no different with the wires hiding.

,
be sure to respect the black and red colors of your speaker wire.
So you have a mess of wire at the receiver and you don't know what speaker it goes to?

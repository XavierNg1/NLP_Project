Figure out how to get where you are going.
Wait at a bus stop.
When you see the bus coming, get your fare or bus pass out.
When you get on say "Hello" before you give the driver your money or pass.
When taking your seat, try to leave the elderly and disabled empty, in case they are needed during your ride.
When your stop is coming up next, pull the yellow cord, usually located near the top of the bus.
When the bus stops go to the back door (depending on which bus you use).
Before you get off, make sure to say "Thank you" to the driver.

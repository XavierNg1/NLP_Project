Choose a peaceful place.
Take a few minutes to examine your thoughts.
Choose a mantra.
Take a few minutes to focus on the breathing.
Take a deep breath before each time you say your mantra.
Allow the mantra to fall in sync with your breathing pattern.
Donâ€™t think about the meaning of the words.
Repeat for as long as desired.

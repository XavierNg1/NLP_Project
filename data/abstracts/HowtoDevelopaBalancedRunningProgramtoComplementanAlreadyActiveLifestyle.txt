Run on different surfaces:


Flat
Smooth - Smooth concrete when wet is very slippery.

Awaken the child in you and do not always run in a straight line.
Run in place.
Add some plyometrics into your routine.
Vary the intensity of your running for speed.
Measure these short bursts in seconds or distance.
For runners who have jobs with a lot of manual labor and some walking, develop a longer program.
Use a stationary bicycle, if your knees hurt easily and cycling is less stressful than jogging.
Log your workouts.

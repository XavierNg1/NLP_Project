Make a list of the things your teen should be doing around the house or for school or for self-improvement that they struggle to complete, or that they whine about.
Make a simple chart on your computer or hand drawn.
Across the top label the columns: Assignment, Sun.
Under assignments list the chores/work you want them to complete such as: Read 30 minutes, Develop Talent 30 Minutes, Room is Clean & Tidy, Daily Jurisdiction, Good Turn, See It - Do It, All Homework Completed, Sweat for 30 Minutes, Dishwasher Loaded and Turned On, etc.

,
Now in each box across the chart draw a short underline on which the teen can sign their initials when the job is completed.
Now count up the number of underlines on the whole chart for the week.
Now this is where it gets interesting.
Keeping score is a big part of this game.
Hand them a new chart on Saturday, and pay them on Saturday night.
This payday experience is also a good opportunity to discuss paying a tithe, paying themselves for long-term savings, paying themselves for mid-term savings, and paying themselves for short-term savings, often 10% in each category.
Presenting this plan to your older teens is a delicate matter and should be handled with great care.
The first few weeks will be a learning experience for everyone as you clarify what a Clean & Tidy Room really means, and how much 90% really is.

After a couple of months, (or when they start getting good or bad at doing the chart) you can start adding other incentives to the mix such as:


Now that you seem to have, (or the opportunity to have) a bit of spending money we need you to take charge of some of your personal needs a bit more...
When they start feeling the pinch of scarce money, be encouraging and gently remind them how much money is in the plan IF they do their part.

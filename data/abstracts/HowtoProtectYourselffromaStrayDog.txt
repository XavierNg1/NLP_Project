Gauge the dog's demeanor.
Do not be mislead by breed stereotypes.
Most dogs, big and small, are not aggressive and are likely to be afraid of you.
For scared dogs, back away slowly until the dog is at ease.
For an aggressive dog, the first priority should be to protect yourself.
If there is nothing that can safely remove you from an aggressive dog, you should use your arm to deflect or absorb any bites.
Very few dogs will actually bite a human being, if unprovoked.

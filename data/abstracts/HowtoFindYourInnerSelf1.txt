Think about the moments you are most proud of in your life.
Identify your values.
Determine the things you want in life.
Think about how you'd spend your time if you had total freedom.
Reconsider the facts, ideas, and outlooks you grew up with or take for granted.
Dig beyond the simplistic labels given to you by others.
Consider taking an in-depth personality test as a jumping off point.
Meditate or spend 10 minutes each day in quiet reflection.
Remember that this is a life-long process, not an quickly accomplished goal.

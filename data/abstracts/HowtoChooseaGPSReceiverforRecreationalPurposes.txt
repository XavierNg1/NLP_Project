Determine what you will be using the GPS receiver for.
Decide on the form-factor of your GPS receiver.
If you prefer the laptop sensor or PDA integrated types, your choices are limited only to compatibility with your operating system (Palm or Windows), and whether or not you want it to connect wirelessly.
If you prefer a vehicle/boat mount unit, examine sizes, possible mount locations, antenna configurations etc.
If you prefer a handheld unit, consider the following additional features and how important they are to you:


Colour screen - More expensive, but some people find them easier to read
Battery requirement & consumption rate - how many batteries does it take, which type, and how long does it take to drain them?,

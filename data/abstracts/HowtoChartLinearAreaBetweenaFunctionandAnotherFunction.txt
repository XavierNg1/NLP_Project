While this workbook directly descends from the previous article, "Chart a Power Function Less Its Derivative", it's been decided not to go through the MODIFY/NEW approach by altering that file under a SAVE AS; however, you are free to do so and might save some time by so doing.
Set the Preferences under the Excel menu:


In General, set R1C1 to Off and select Show the 10 Most Recent Documents .
Go to cell A8 and do Freeze Panes under the Window menu.
Create the Defined Variables Upper Section (here's a picture):


We will be entering the function f(x) 1*(x-1)^3 + 10 and the function g(x) 1*3x^2 + 10.
Enter the Column Formulas:


Into cell A2, input "=H2" w/o quotes.
Calculate Arc Length


Select O1 and enter Arc Length.
Create the Chart:


Because the column B y values vary between the f(x) Function and the g(x) Function, the chart draws lines connecting successive {x,y} pairs and so fills in the difference.
Find the Area Between the 2 Functions (please see attached picture):


Go to C366 and enter 1 and Format Cell Number Number Custom 0) , where there is a space after the right parenthesis.
Save the upper data section that is sufficient to re-create the form, cell range A1:O7, by copying and pasting it to the Saves worksheet.

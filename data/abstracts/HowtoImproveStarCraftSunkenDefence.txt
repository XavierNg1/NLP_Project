Determine what kind of maze you want to build.
Acknowledge that the object of your maze is not to keep the enemy from moving, if they do this too long then they will attack your base.
Watch your allies to get ideas for different mazes.

On most maps there are small enemies that can run through the gaps of two sunkens.
Don't make walls.
There is only 1 kind of wall that can be used in certain maps such as the common 10 way map, it is a diagonal wall that separates between the 2 spawns or either way on the middle position.

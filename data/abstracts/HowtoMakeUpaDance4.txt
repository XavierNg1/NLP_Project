Schedule a time to practice.
Don’t be afraid to revise your routine.As you practice you might find that you’ll start to come up with little tweaks to the routine that you feel make it more interesting.
Practice until you’re comfortable with your dance.Once you feel like you can do the dance all the way through by heart and get it right every time, keep practicing.

Say something funny.
Listen for any rustling or breathing from the closet.
Look for any signs that your closet has been opened or tampered with, generally a badly closed door or something moved out of the way.
Turn on the light (or use a flashlight) to peer inside the closet before opening it if your closet has a slit in it.
If you have a temperature gun and your closet has cracks, fire that inside and look for temperature spikes.
Lock your closet somehow.
Ask "Is anyone inside of my closet?",
Slowly open the closet door, having a good grip on the handle and using your foot to prevent the door from opening far.

Repeat step 7 until the door is fully open.

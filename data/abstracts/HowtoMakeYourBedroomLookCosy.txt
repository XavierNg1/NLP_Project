Identify a color you like from an existing item you have in your room for inspiration.
Test out potential colors.
Focus on the colors that are most attractive to you.
Purchase a small pot of the color you like and paint it on white poster board if your store doesn’t offer large color samples.
Leave the paint samples on the wall for a few days to find your favorite.

Buy candles of varying heights and place them around the room.
Look for help hanging either a pendant light from the ceiling or track lighting.

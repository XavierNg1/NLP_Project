Determine if you need to use wall plugs, or if you can hang an item on a stud.
Buy a set of universal wall plugs if your item weighs less than 15 lbs.
Choose butterfly wall plugs if you are hanging light items, like paintings, in hollow walls.
Move on to hammer fixings for medium to heavy items.
Use anchor bolts for very heavy loads, up to 440lbs.
Purchase toggle plugs if you want to anchor an item to the ceiling.
Match your power drill bit to the size of the wall anchor.
Measure the exact place where you want to hang your item.
Drill a pilot hole into the wall using your correct bit.
Insert the wall plug into the hole.
Insert the screw into the wall plug.
Assess whether part of the screw is smooth, rather than threaded.
Hang your item.

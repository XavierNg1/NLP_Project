Listen and pay attention.
Act with confidence in everything you do.
Donâ€™t show signs of frustration.
See the entire picture.
Drill Sergeants are human too and, believe it or not, are there to help you.
Do not aspire to be a Drill Sergeant's friend.
Do not attempt to try on a Drill Sergeants hat.
It helps if you are a "Military Brat", since you'll be used to military life at an early age.

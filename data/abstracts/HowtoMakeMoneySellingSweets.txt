Decide how much money you would like to invest.
Selling merchandise to people can be the hardest part.
Once you have established with some people that you are selling sweets, they might come back asking for some more.

,
Ask how much money people are willing to spend if they offer to buy, and try to sell for more.
Buy more expensive sweets to sell at higher prices when your budget increases.
Try to get a fan base not only in your year-group, but also both the higher and lower ones.
You should also try to record what you have sold, what profit you have made and so on.
Sell things that you think people will want on that day (e.g if it is a boiling hot day then lemonade or water sell really well).

Sell separate pieces of gum from a packet.
Sell things you will make most profit on (e.g if you buy a pack of 4 chocolates for $1 in a shop, then sell them for 50 cents each and you will make 100% profit).

Get supplies/stock to sell at school.
Advertise.

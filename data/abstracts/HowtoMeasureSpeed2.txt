Find a wall that reflects sound.
Measure a distance of at least 50 m (54.5 yards) from the wall.
Clap your hands in time to the echo from the wall.
Clap your hands 11 times while recording time with the stopwatch.
Multiply the distance by 10.
Divide the distance the sound traveled by the amount of time it took to clap.

Use this wrapping method for a substantial gift.
Wrap the box in tissue paper first.
Cut a large square or rectangle of doubled-up tulle.
Begin lifting the tulle over the wrapped gift from one corner.
Hold the bunched up top firmly.
Slip the satin ribbon underneath the gift and bring it up the sides.
Trim the ends of the ribbon.
Finish off by fluffing out the tulle topping so that it stands upright and billows out over the gift.
Finished.

Understand how scoring works to plan your shots well.
Remember that speed makes it easier to pickup spares.
Lower, or "weaken," your wrist on your shot to get less spin and a straighter throw.
Adjust your starting position based on your spare.
Use the middle of the lane when trying to hit the far right and left pins.
Aim for the most pins possible during a split.

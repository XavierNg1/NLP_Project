Put your starter plants in cups with some good potting soil and leave them in the sun for a week or two, watering them daily/as needed until they have accepted their new environment.

Till your garden.

Plant the tobacco plants in rows where the rows are three feet apart.
Water and maybe use some Miracle Grow and keep an eye on them as they take hold and grow.
When the flower develops on the top of the plant, you need to cut it off.
Cut them down.
Be as selective as you like as to which leaves to pull from the plants.
Once you've picked all of the dried leaves you wish to harvest, simply run them through a food processor.
You can store your tobacco in leftover three pound coffee containers.

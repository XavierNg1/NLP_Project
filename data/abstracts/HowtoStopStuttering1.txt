Mentally and physically relax... Tell yourself that you really are going to do fine.
Stand in front of the mirror and imagine the person in the mirror being someone else.
Read books out loud.
Visualize the words you're going to say before you say them.
When you stutter, try letting out tension in between blocks.
Get in the right frame of mind.
Try breathing exercises to make speech easier.
Try putting some rhythm into your speech.
If you're making a speech, don't look directly at someone.
Don't sweat the small stuff.
Never give up.

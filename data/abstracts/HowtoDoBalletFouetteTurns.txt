Start holding the barre in first or fifth position.
To prep for practice, go to passé en relevé.
Plié and dèveloppé front.
Open your leg to the side, or à la seconde.
Bring everything in at once.
Once you have those three moves down, do a pirouette.
Establish your one-legged relevés, ensuring you can do thirty-two comfortably in a row.
Staying planted on your relevé foot, practice the out, around and inward foot movement with your free leg.
Focus on your supporting leg to stay in place, not the swinging leg.
Use the swing to the side to build your momentum.
Coordinate the extension of your hands with your leg kick.
Keep your chest up and open to spin easier.

Pick a child that is three to seven years old.
Choose a child who is confident and capable.
Ask the child’s parents first.
Propose with a ring pop.
Tell the child you want them to be a “Ring Protection Agent.” Rather than asking them to be the “ring bearer,” which may not make sense to them, ask them to be in charge of protecting the rings.
Take them out for a special day.
Make them a “Be our ring bearer” puzzle.

Start piling the items by category.
Gather a few items aside such as aluminum foil, Ziplocs, paper towels, scissors, a few plastic cups, plastic plates, utensils, and a knife.
If you have to clean your place before moving out, leave a few cleaning supplies out in the cabinet, so you wonâ€™t pack them by accident.
Make one box of each size.
For your fine china, you can use packing paper and/or bubble wrap.
Make sure you tape the top of all open boxes that contain food items such as barely, cereal, rice...
Pair light weight non-breakable cookware and bowls with heavier electronics such as bread makers, toasters, or juicers.
Take care when packing knives and other sharp objects.
Each box should be packed tight.
Mark boxes with the name of the room where the box should be delivered.

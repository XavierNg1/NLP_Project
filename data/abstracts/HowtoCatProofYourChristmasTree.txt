Start off smart by considering the type of tree you'll use.
Select a strong and unwavering base for holding the tree.
Choose a safe location for the tree.
Consider not decorating the tree initially.
Decorate the tree with your cat firmly out of the way.
Choose ornaments less likely to be attractive to your cats.
Place decorations that are especially delicate, enticing or dangerous high up the tree, in the top two-thirds of the tree.
Attach ornaments onto the tree securely so that they cannot be simply pelted or lifted off.
Be careful with electrical wires and lighting.
Relax now.

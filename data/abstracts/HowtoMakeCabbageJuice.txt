Boil the water in a small pot for 30 minutes.
Put the chopped cabbage and the water into a blender.
Blend the cabbage and water together at low speed.
Blend the mixture on high for 10 seconds.
Pour the mixture into a 1-quart (1 liter) jar.
Tightly seal the jar with plastic wrap.
Allow the cabbage mixture to sit undisturbed at room temperature.
Let the cabbage mixture sit for 3 full days or 72 hours.
Place a mesh strainer over a clean, empty jar.
Pour the pulpy liquid through the strainer and into the second jar.
Cap the jar.
Repeat this process when your original supply gets low, reserving 1/2 cup (125 milliliters) of your original batch.
Allow your new batch to sit at room temperature for 24 hours before straining.

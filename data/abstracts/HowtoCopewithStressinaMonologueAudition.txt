Think about the reasons you are stressed out before you figure out how to fix it entirely.
Deal with your Stage Fright.
You are not at the mercy of them, they are at the mercy of you.
Know the monologue.
Memorize the monologue.
Have a relaxing day before the auditions.
Stop reading about how to cope with it and relax.
Deep breathing, slow your heart rate down.
When you get to the audition room, study the space.

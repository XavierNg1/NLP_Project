Review the area of a parallelogram.
Compare triangles and parallelograms.
Find the isosceles triangle's base.
Draw a line between the base to the opposite vertex.
Look at one half of your isosceles triangle.
Set up the Pythagorean Theorem.
Solve for h. Remember, the area formula uses b and h, but you don't know the value of h yet.
Plug in the values for your triangle to find h. Now that you know this formula, you can use it for any isosceles triangle where you know the sides.
Plug the base and height into your area formula.

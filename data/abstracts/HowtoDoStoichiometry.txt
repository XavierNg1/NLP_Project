Write down the number of atoms that comprise each compound on either side of the equation.
Add a coefficient in front of elements that are not oxygen and hydrogen to balance each side.
Balance the hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
Re-count the number of atoms on each side of the equation to make sure they are equal.
Calculate the molar mass of the compound given in grams.
Convert grams of a substance to moles using molar mass.
Determine the molar ratio between reactants.
Cross-multiply by the molar ratio to find moles of other reactant.
Convert moles back to mass using the molar mass of the species.
Determine if the reaction is happening at standard temperature and pressure (STP).
Use the conversion factor 22.414 L/mol to convert liters of gas to moles.
Use the ideal gas law to convert liters of gas not at STP.
Calculate the density of the liquid.
Convert the volume to milliliters (mL).
Multiply the volume by the density.
Calculate the molar mass of the reactant.
Convert grams of a substance to moles using molar mass.

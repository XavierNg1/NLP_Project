Choose a time and location carefully.
Ask your child if anyone has been touching him or her in an unsafe manner or in a way that makes him or her feel uncomfortable.
Use a nonjudgmental tone when discussing sexual abuse with your child.
Explain to your child that it is okay to disclose a secret, even if an adult has made him or her promise not to do so.
Believe your child - children rarely make false allegations of sexual abuse.
Follow-up with your child, especially if your suspicions persist but he or she does not reveal sexual abuse.
Take sexual abuse allegations seriously.

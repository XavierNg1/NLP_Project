Determine the height of the header by adding 3 1/4 inches (8.26 cm) to the length of the new door, and then add the height of the soleplate, which will only be necessary if the floor is carpeted.
Cut the stud tops to this determined length to support the new header.
Install the new header using nails or screws and then cut and install the soleplate to the floor.

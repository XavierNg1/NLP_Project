After you have chosen which picture you are going to collage and have opened it within Photoshop CS5 you'll need to duplicate the background layers.
Add a blank layer between the background layer and layer 1.
Fill the new layer as black, the foreground color.With layer 2 selected, click on the new layer icon again to create Layer 3

,
Select the rectangular marquee tool from the sidebar on the left.
Fill the selection from step 5 with black.
Now we need to create a clipping mask using the selection we just filled with black in step 6.
Now we need to add another new blank layer above layer 2.
Now select the rectangular marquee toolagain from the left side tool bar and drag out the border of the Polaroid photo around the first inside Polaroid image.

,
We want to fill the selected section with white, thus looking like a Polaroid picture.
To give the photo a more realistic collage look, we can rotate it however we'd like.
Now we need to group the three layers that makeup the Polaroid picture, layers 1, 3, and 4.
Now we want to create more Polaroids that are the same shape and size of our original one, so we want to duplicate this layer group.
Expand this folder and select both layers 3 and 4 (holding down shift to select both) and then with these two selected hold down command+T.
Repeat steps 13 and 14 until you have gathered a collage of Polaroids.

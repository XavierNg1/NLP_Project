Good WIND archetypes are Harpies, Mist Valley, and Speedroids.
Buy the Structure deck "Lord of the Storm".
Add in your two "Flying Kamakiri #1" to your deck.
Add 2 or 3 "Simorgh, Bird of Ancestry".
Add in 2 "Hunter Owl", and 2 "Icarus Attack", because most of your monsters will also be Winged-Beast.
Optionally, you can include a few "Harpie lady" cards.
If it is within your budget, use "Mist Valley Soldier" and "Mist Valley Shaman" as your Tuner monsters.
Add basic Staple Cards like MST, Torrential Tribute, etc.
Fill the rest of your deck with cards of your choosing.

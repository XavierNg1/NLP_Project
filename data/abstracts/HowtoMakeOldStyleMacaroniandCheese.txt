Grate the cheese coarsely and set it aside (a food processor with a grater disc will do this quickly).

,
Bring a big pot of water to a boil, add salt to the water, then add the macaroni.
Make the white sauce.
Drain the macaroni, giving it a few good shakes to get as much water out as possible.
Remove the sauce from the stove and stir in the grated cheese and the cooked macaroni.
Serve or bake.
Finished.

Make sure that at least two people hear you call seat check.
Seat check does have certain limitations.
Upon returning to your seat, you will find it either occupied or unoccupied.
Explain that you called seat check.

If they do not move or don't believe you, consult your witnesses.

If your witnesses corroborate and they still do not move, explain that they are being lame and that you would never do such a thing for them.
If they still don't move, find another seat/stand.

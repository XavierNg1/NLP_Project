Choose a pair of jeans that you want to ladder.
Rub the laddered area with sandpaper or a pumice stone.
Mark the area where you want to create the ladder.
Place a magazine or cardboard into the leg of your jeans.
Cut two slits to create your ladder.
Look at the underside of the cut and pull out the blue threads.
Continue to pull blue threads until your jeans are laddered.
Continue to create ladders until you reach the look you want.

Decide if ready made orthotics are a better option for you.
Do your research.
Ask a chiropractor what type of store-bought orthotics he/she would recommend for your foot type (whether you have a high arch, low arch, etc.).
Go to different stores or their websites and compare prices for the same type of orthotics.
Purchase the orthotic of your choice that best fits your feet.

Determine the horizon in your drawing.
Determine the point of view, which is the approximate location of the eye of the person viewing the drawing.
Determine your first vanishing point.
Determine your second vanishing point.
Sketch your main objects drawing the vertical lines perfectly vertical, the horizontal lines moving to the left at an angle towards the left vanishing point and the horizontal lines moving to the right at an angle towards the right vanishing point (all the horizontal lines should converge in one or the other of the vanishing points if extended far enough).

,
Give detail to your drawing respecting the trends given by the horizontal lines sketched for the main objects.

Refrain for desensitizing training unless your cat is well trained.
Teach your cat the command “relax.” Use a clicker or lure to teach your cat to sit down peacefully next to you.
Expose your cat to light noise.
Increase the volume once your cat has adjusted to the noise.
Practice training in a real life scenario.

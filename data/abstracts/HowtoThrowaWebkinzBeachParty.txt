Get some Webkinz.
Get things that can float in water.
Put the buckets around your party area.
You can buy special clothes for your Webkinz that deal with summertime and the beach.
If you are outside, you could get sand and make sandcastles around the yard.
Leave your festive Webkinz everywhere.
Make cool invitations to invite your friends with.
You can make treats for your friends to enjoy while they're at your house.
Also, if time and budget permits, make cute little thank-you bags for your friends.
If you have a pool, tell your friends to bring their bathing suits and go swimming!

,
Have fun!

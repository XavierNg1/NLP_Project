Be prepared to be netting for someone else.

Reel your own line in as quickly as you can.

Wait until you are asked before getting the net.

Once the angler has requested the net, grab it and make sure it is ready.

Once you have determined which side of the boat the fish will be coming to, get the net into the water.

Do not jab at the fish with the net.

Turn the net so that it offers the largest possible entry to the fish.
,

As soon as the fish is past the rim of the net, lift it out with a slight scooping motion.

Bring the net into the boat.

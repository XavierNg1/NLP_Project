The Ender Dragon can't break bedrock or obsidian.
The Snow Golems can damage the Ender Dragon.Destroy the ender crystals as fast as possible.A arrow deals more damage than a sword in a fight with the Ender Dragon.
Keep potions and golden apples ready.
Just keep moving.
Make a redstone defence system to push obsidian over your windows and doors.
Maybe make a high tower for jumping off with a elytra again.

Become more tolerant of "conflict," "inconsistency" or "confrontation", in the classroom.
Be aware that encouraging critical thinking can promote (some) kind of a psychological discomfort in (some) students as conflicting accounts of information and ideas are argued and debated.
Promote and facilitate logical and emotive ideas by both: (1) "analysis" involving dis-assembling/digesting concepts into constituent parts (recording data and statistics) and (2) "synthesis" which involves assembling concepts from information and data that may have been found by analysis.
Help students develop skills for resolving such dissonance.
Allow conflicts and confrontational thinking.

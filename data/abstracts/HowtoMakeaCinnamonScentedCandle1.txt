Hot glue the wick to the bottom of an empty 4-ounce (120-milliliter) jar.
Place two pencils over the mouth of the jar, and balance the wick between them.
Melt the wax.
Take the measuring cup with the wax out of the water, and stir 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon into the wax using a wooden skewer.
Pour the wax into the candle.
Wait for the wax to harden, then remove the sticks holding the wick in place.
Trim the wick down to Â¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) with a pair of scissors.
Use the candle.

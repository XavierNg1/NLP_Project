Log on to Neopets and go to the Games Room.
The first 3 jumps, you will start with little red dots called trackers.
For the next 2 jumps, you'll need some practice.
After losing a few times, you might have come up with some other tips.
It's good to try to get the coins on the jumps, you can get a bonus if you get all of them.
You only have three lives, so be careful not to die to much.

Fill the casserole dish with water until the water is just a bit over half full.
Add 1 to 2 tablespoons salt to the water.
Wash the rice and rinse.
Drain the rice in a colander.
Add cooked lentils, fried raisins and onions to the rice in the colander or any other appropriate pan.
Put the empty casserole dish on the hub.
Carefully, add 1 or 2 teaspoons of water to the sizzling oil.
Add either potato slices or tortilla to put at the bottom of the casserole dish.
Use a wooden spoon, make the risotto in a cone shape inside the casserole dish.
Reduce the heat to 2.
Shake the casserole dish slowly to see if the bottom of the rice is separated from the casserole dish.
Put a round serving dish over the casserole dish and nimbly turn over the rice into it, like emptying out a baked cake.
Take the meal to the table.

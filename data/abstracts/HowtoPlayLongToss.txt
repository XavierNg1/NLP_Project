Find a football field where yard markers are shown.
STRETCH!!!,
Start off kneeling, making sure to go through the entire motion of throwing.
When you can't reach your throwing buddy anymore from your knees, stand up and continue to try to throw through your partners head/chest with the ball.
Remember the most important thing about this process is to not overstress your arm.
As your arm tires, have your partner come in about 5 yards (4.6Â m) each time you throw.

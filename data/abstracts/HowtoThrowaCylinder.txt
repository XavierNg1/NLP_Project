Even before throwing (which is the term used when making a pot on the wheel) you need to make yourself comfortable.
Slam a round ball of clay as close to the center of the wheel as possible.
Start the wheel and allow it to spin slowly.
Place your hands on the cone only after the wheel is going at a medium pace.
While pressing down with the thumb into the center of the piece, use your other hand to guide your thumb into the piece.
Once a hole is established use both of your hands to widen the gap.
Squeeze the walls up by placing your index finger of your left hand on the inside while your right index finger is on the outside.
Repeat pulling until the walls of the cylinder are thick enough for you, which is about a quarter of an inch thick.
Cup a moderately wet sponge around the top edge of the piece and apply slight pressure to make the edge rounded and more appealing.

Slowly slide a wire underneath your piece while the wheel is moving at a slow pace.

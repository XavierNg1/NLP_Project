As with all lawn mower repairs, remove the spark plug lead, and ensure that it is a safe distance from the plug.
Check the oil, plug, and air filter to rule out these simple repairs.

Check compression.
Troubleshoot bad compression, if you had it.
Check for a bent crankshaft by tipping the mower with the exhaust up (gas will drip out, but this cannot be prevented).
NOTE: Everything beyond this point should only be done by those who know what they're doing and have dismantled and engine before.

If compression was not the problem, check for spark by removing the plug from the head, replacing the lead and grounding the tip against the block.
If you had spark, check the carburetor by removing the air cleaner and its assembly from the carburetor and check the following.
Inspect the throttle with the air cleaner still off, move the throttle knob to see if it fully opens and shuts and, if necessary, clean it out.
Inspect the manifold check the intake manifold for holes and try to wiggle it.
Check the flywheel key, the small, removable notch in the flywheel.
Recheck your work.

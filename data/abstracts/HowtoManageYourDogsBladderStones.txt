Be wary when your dog starts getting a lot of infections.
Understand that you will be faced with having to get the stones removed when the abrasiveness of the stones final draws blood from the bladder wall; this will come out in the urine.

Keep your dog's urine acidic, as bacteria thrives in alkali solutions.

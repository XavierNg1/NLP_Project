Consider what your priorities lay.
Always be in touch.
Make sure your partner is aware of the times you plan to hang out with your friends or have private time alone.
Remember that you are committed, not barred in a relationship.
Let your partner do their things as they want.
Make sure you are there when your best friend needs a shoulder to lean or cry on.
Don't be afraid to speak out about how you feel, but do consider other people's feelings and do it in the gentlest but firmest way.
Enjoy your flourishing garden of relationship and friendships!

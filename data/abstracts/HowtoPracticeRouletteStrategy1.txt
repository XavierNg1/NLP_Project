Know a bit about the martingale strategy.
Find a roulette table with a small minimum bet and a high maximum bet.
Bet a small amount on black or red, even or odd, 1-18 or 19-36.
If you win, pocket your winnings and bet the same small amount.
If you lose, double the amount you last wagered and place the bet on the same color again.
If you win on the second bet, collect your winnings and place the original small bet or leave the casino.
If you lose again, double your bet and try again.

Repeat these steps until you either lose all of your money or you hit the table maximum.

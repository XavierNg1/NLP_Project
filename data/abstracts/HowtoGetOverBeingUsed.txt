Have a good cry.
Combat the heartbreak.
Work up a great sweat every day.
Talk about it!,
Realize your position.
Understand the person's motives.
Let yourself feel a sense of relief and freedom.
Write down some things that should have made you questioned the relationship.
Move on!,
Chalk this up to experience.

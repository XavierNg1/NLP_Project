Alex's trademark item of clothing for her tops has to be her white leather jacket.
The 80s really were about tight jeans.
No one can forget the dress Alex wore when she first burst into 1981!,
Alex had a pair of white boots to compliment the white jacket as well as a matching black pair.
Alex always wears accessories that compliment the outfit she's wearing.
And there you have it - your very own Alex Drake standing before you as your reflection!

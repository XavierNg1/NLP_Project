Try to understand the Acela train route.
Obtain a schedule of train departures and arrivals to see when and exactly where which Acela train will stop at the designated station.
Purchase a seat from the Amtrak website, via the Self Service kiosk or from another official Amtrak-approved method.
Pick up your tickets a few days before the trip (if you haven't already thought about that differently).
Board your train when the station board says that your train is "Now Boarding" for that train number.

Be prepared to hand your Acela ticket to the Amtrak attendant who will come around to collect them.

Consider your dog's breed.
Notice if your puppy bites harder than his litter mates.
Switch from auditory commands to visual or physical commands to test your pupâ€™s hearing.
Check to see if your puppy moves his ears when you call him or if there is a loud noise.
Notice if the habits and tendencies of your grown dog start to change.
Bang two pan lids together, clap your hands, and blow a whistle.
Always make noises a sufficient distance away from your dog.
Take your dog to the park and call his name as he runs around.
Get your dog checked out by your vet.
Have your vet refer your dog for a BAER test.
Allow the specialist to administer a BAER test.

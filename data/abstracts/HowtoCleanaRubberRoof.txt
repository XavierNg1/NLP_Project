Clean your roof 3-4 times per year.
Get a good inspection.
Use any commercial grade cleanser such as Protect All Rubber Roof Cleaner.

,
If your RV roof is VERY dirty (black), you may want to cover the sides of your vehicle with plastic sheets.
Sweep, or rinse off, as much of the loose grime as possible.

,
Apply your rubber roof cleaner using a spraying mechanism.
Use a sponge mop, or soft bristle brush if it is very dirty, to activate the cleaner using a circular motion.

,
Absorb the dissolved grimy residue with the sponge mop.
Repeat previous steps until entire roof is clean.

,
Use a hose with a spray nozzle and remove any remaining amounts of old grimy residue.

,
Inspect the clean roof for cracks along the edges of the EPDM barrier where the self leveling sealant is starting to lift up or become degraded in any way.
If the sealant is starting to lift off, gently remove as much as you can, clean the area and re-apply self leveling sealant.

,
Take a fresh (new) tube of self leveling sealant, insert this tube of sealant into a caulking gun with the pointed nozzle end placed into the designed slot opposite from the ratcheting mechanism.
Apply this sealant along the cracked or potential pin holed area that you have just cleaned from any dirt and grime.
Go to any RV supply store and tell them you want to clean your EPDM roof.

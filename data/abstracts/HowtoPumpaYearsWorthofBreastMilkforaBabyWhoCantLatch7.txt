Keep pumping (and freezing, if space allows) until you have an adequate supply.
Talk to your midwife or physician about how to quit pumping.
When you have no more fresh milk, very quickly pull all your shoe boxes out of your freezer, laying them out in order of when you filled them.
If you end up with extra milk to sell or donate, make sure to mention in your offer that you had to pump every drop for your baby and still fed him an entire year's worth of breast milk.

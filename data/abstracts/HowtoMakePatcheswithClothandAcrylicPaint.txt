Cut a piece of fabric in the size you'd like the patch to be.
Find a stencil of the design you'd like.
Using a razor or x-acto knife, cut out the stencil along the lines.
Smile, the hardest part is over!,
Wet your paintbrush and dry it slightly on a paper towel so that the paint will not be thick and lumpy on your brush.
Wait for it to dry.
When you are satisfied with the color, carefully undo the tape and peel the stencil off, and any additional paper pieces.
You can also use this method for stenciling shirts and other things!

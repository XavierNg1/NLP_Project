Chances are, the group will let you join them.
Remember, you are now part of the group and you should consider yourself thusly.
Make sure you show up at planned times agreed on by the group and try to make yourself available.
If you have become fairly good friends with your cruise group, then on the last day you may want to exchange e-mails or Facebook addresses with one another.

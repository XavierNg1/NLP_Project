Identify how far away you are from the basket.
Identify the direction and velocity of the wind.
Choose your disc.Place your index finger so the knuckle closest to your finger tip is resting on the bottom of the rim of the disc.Keep your thumb pressed on the top of the disc.
Place the rest of your fingers where you feel they are most comfortable.Face the basket.
Place your dominant foot ahead of the other, so it is closer to the basket.Point your forward foot towards the basket, but slightly turned toward your opposite foot.
Place your back foot so that you could draw a line from the basket, through the ball of your front foot to your back heel.Make sure your knees are bent and you are balanced.
Bring the disc out in front of you with your arm out, about chest level.With your arm extended, bring the disc down to your front thigh.
Shift your weight backwards.
While raising your extended arm to the release point, push off of your back foot and move your weight back onto your front foot.
Release the disc when your weight is fully forward.
If you made the putt, good job!,
If you missed, try to identify what went wrong.

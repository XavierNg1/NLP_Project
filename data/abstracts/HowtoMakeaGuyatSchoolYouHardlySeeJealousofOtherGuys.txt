Be yourself and stay who you are.
Do not change the way you dress, the way you look,or apply new make-up.
Let him notice you.
Talk with other guys in places where your target guy will see you doing so, if it's normal for you to talk to guys.
If he just sees you with guy friends in general no flirting or anything, or doesn't even listen to your conversation, do not stare at him at all, or don't stare at him as much as you usually do.
Make him want your attention.
Do not act like your "all that" and/or "popular/conceited" or something in any way.
Be friendly and nice to him.
Act normal for you and how you feel is cool around him and act as if you never stared at him or liked him.

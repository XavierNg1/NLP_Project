Buy the right equipment.
Purchase a slim fitting, quilted, padded cover.
Consider making a special cover for the laptop or computer that can be "worn" during use.
Keep the laptop or computer well-wrapped during travel.
Keep a laptop snug in a cover (as described above), then place it in its carry-bag and - if you can - slip it into a backpack for additional warmth.
Avoid taking it out of the car into a sudden drastic change of temperature.Given that you are less likely to use it, don't try to use it in a freezing cold hotel room; wait until the room and the computer warms up first before switching it on.
Ditto for when you arrive at your final destination - give the computer time to temperature settle before powering it up.

Gather the pens and pencils you'd like to carry in your case.
Choose two colors of duct tape.
Using the measurement you have taken of the pen, cut a piece of duct tape that is 2-3 times longer than the measured pen you want to hold.

,
Cut two other strips and attach all three of them together to form a duct tape fabric that is a little wider than your selection of pens.
Next, cut strips for your liner color tape, which should be the width you want your finished pencil case to be.
Put the cover and liner tape strips together.
Tape the edge of the bottom of the duct tape fabric and make sure that the two colors are even.

,
Fold the bottom end up, and crease it without sticking the edges yet.
Trim the sides of the folded portion.
Using the pen as the point of reference, make an upper strap or loop.
Fold the sticky side flaps in and stick them down over both the bottom pocket and the upper loop.
Put your pens in the pocket and check the size.
Fold the top flap down.
Trim the end of the top flap so that it will stick into the bottom pocket.
Fold short pieces of tape over the sides and end of the flap and any exposed edges.
Reinforce the bottom of the pocket with another piece of tape if you want.

,
Put your pens and pencils in the case, fold the flap over, tuck it in, and enjoy!

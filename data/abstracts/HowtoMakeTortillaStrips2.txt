Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
In a small bowl, mix together the seasonings briskly with a fork, then set them aside.
Stack 2 to 3 tortillas on top of each other.
Cut the tortillas into ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) wide strips.
Toss the strips with vegetable oil.
Add in your seasoning and toss the strips again.
Spread the strips out in a single layer on two large baking sheets.
Bake the strips for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they turn golden brown.
Let the strips cool on the baking sheet before serving them.
Finished.

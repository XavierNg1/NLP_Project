Pick up everything that's on the floor and put it on your bed, so you won't be tempted to stop cleaning and sleep.
Sort out everything else in your room.
Get a bin liner and throw out everything from the 'throw away' pile.
Get a bag for the 'give away' pile.
Go through all the 'not sure' objects.
You should have 2 piles left - keep and storage.
Before you put the 'keep' items back into their places, it's time to clean.
Put the 'keep' items back in their places in the room only after you have cleaned them.

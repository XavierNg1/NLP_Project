First think about what you want your god/dess/es to be like and what type of community would worship s/he, it, or them.
Also, what you can do is, if you have a very creative mind (which we all do have), is write your own fantasy fiction, with it's own religion or religions, with a god or gods which you have of your own creation.
Write down ideas for what this god or goddess is like: is this deity good or evil?,
Are there rules.
Describe the place of worship.
Holidays.
Background.
Objects of worship.
Weekly worships.
Most important (Or so I believe, but who really knows...) The "BIBLE" and, no, not the bible, just a kind of guide that brings your religion together.
(For Fiction) Once you have all your ideas together, begin to write your story.

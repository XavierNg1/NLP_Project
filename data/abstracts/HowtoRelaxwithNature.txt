Go to a park or a beach some place where you'll find nature at its best.
Find a quiet, peaceful spot.
Relax.
Lie down on the grass as soon as you are very comfortable.
Think about peaceful things.
Listen to the peaceful sounds.
Watch the animals.
Look at the sky.
You can also take a walk in the park or along the seashore while just absorbing all the wonders nature has to offer you.

Once you are done relaxing, you can go back to your mundane chores feeling refreshed.

Make your pizza dough.
Knead the dough on a floured surface.
Allow the dough to rest covered in a warm place for about 10 minutes to relax and expand.

,
Using your clean fingers, press the dough out until it is 1/2 an inch or 1 & 1/2cm thick.
Preheat your oven to 200C / 395F and heat your pizza stone.

,
Now it is time for the toppings:


Style 1: sprinkle 1T of olive oil onto the dough and dimple/press with your fingers until it is absorbed.
Allow each pizza 5-10 minutes to prove in a warm place - if you pinch a corner, it should be soft and stretchy.

,
Slide the pizza off the back of the biscuit tray onto the stone - practice makes perfect.Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown and serve

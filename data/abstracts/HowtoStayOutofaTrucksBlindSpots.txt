Know where all the semi-truck's blind spots are.
Be patient.
Do not follow a truck too closely.
Keep both (left and right) truck mirrors in your sights as much as possible when traveling behind a truck.
Give plenty of space when driving in front of a truck.
Pass or overtake a truck with care.
Avoid cutting in too soon after passing.
Do not drive along a truck's right-hand side when the truck is turning right.
Pay attention to a truck's brake lights and turn signals.
Blow your horn if you see the turn signal on your side come on or if you notice a truck start moving into your lane.

Hair: Do you feel like your hair is dull or lifeless?,
Skin: Oh, the skin.
Lips: Many girls seek a full, smooth pout but your lips don't HAVE to be full to be gorgeous and kissable.
Make up: While make up is not necessary, it can often help you feel better on days where you feel like you don't look as gorgeous as usual.
Impurities: Use concealer, toner, exfoliator, and cleanser when necessary.

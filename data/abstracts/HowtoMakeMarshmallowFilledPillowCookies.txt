Scoop out the dough from its container or bowl and set it on top of a cutting board.
Knead the dough lightly.
Get your marshmallows.
Put the marshmallow in the center of the circle.
Using your thumb and index finger, slide the dough smoothly over the marshmallow, like wrapping a dumpling.
Roll the dough-wrapped marshmallow between your palm until it's shaped like a plump sausage.
Continue making, wrapping, and smoothing the cookies until you have about twelve and the mound of dough is gone.
Bake the cookies at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 10-12 minutes or until done.
If you want, you can add sprinkles, chocolate chips, or icing.

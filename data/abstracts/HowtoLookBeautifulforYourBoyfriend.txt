Shower regularly.
Get the hands of your dreams.
Get kissable lips.
Moisturize your body.
Take care of your pearly whites.
Maintain beautiful brows.
Wear flattering clothes.
Style your hair.
Wear simple makeup.
Accessorize.
Know that your boyfriend always thinks you look beautiful.
Be positive.
Don’t put yourself down.
Don’t compare yourself to other women.
Ooze confidence.
Smile!

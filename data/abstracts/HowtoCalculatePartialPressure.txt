Treat each gas as an “ideal” gas.
Define the quantities the gases are measured in.
Understand Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures.
Define the partial pressure equation for the gases you’re working with.
Convert the temperature to degrees Kelvin.
Find the number of moles of each gas present in the sample.
Plug in the values for the moles, volume, and temperature.
Plug in the value for the constant R. We’ll report the partial and total pressures in atmospheres, so we’ll use the value for R of 0.0821 L atm/K mol.
Calculate the partial pressures for each gas.
Define the partial pressure equation as before.
Add the number of moles of each gas in the sample to find the total number of moles in the gas mixture.
Find the total pressure of the gas mixture.
Find the proportion each gas makes of the total mixture.
Multiply the proportional amount of each gas by the total pressure to find the partial pressure.

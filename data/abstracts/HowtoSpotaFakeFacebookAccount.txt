Know why it is important to spot a fake account.
Think twice about accepting friend requests from people you don't know or who haven't been connected to you through legitimate, verifiable means.
Read the profile carefully.
Check out their friends.
Be alert to anyone new that you've friended but don't really know.
Beware interconnected faking.
Look for and record inconsistencies in the things they say to you.
Do a double take if the person says anything weird or "out-of-character".
Be really wary of undying declarations of love, affection, and romance.
Unfriend this person if you're suspicious, unsure, or uncomfortable with having them as part of your Facebook friends.

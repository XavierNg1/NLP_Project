For clothing, make sure you know exactly how many days you will be away.
Make a list of everything you use in a day.
Start with your location: Will you be at a friend or family member's home where you can use their items sometimes?,
Start with your head: Shampoo and conditioner, gel, spray, your own brush or comb (you never want to be stuck with lice), etc.

Include other things like medications â€“ you'll need proof that these are yours if you are going to an airport, so take a prescription form or something with you.. Make sure you have enough to last the trip plus a day or two.

Pack electronic gear.
Remember things that will entertain you.
Don't forget your underwear, spending money, and lots of lollies or treats if you are traveling in a car.

Try to shorten the things you want to say.
Always have a smirk or closed-mouth smile, it makes you look more mysterious, as if you know something that they do not know.

Don't lose your temper, as it can make you look crazy and people will think that you have anger issues, something which you (hopefully) would not want someone to think.
Sit in parks or next to trees and write in a notepad, draw, or read.
Try not to laugh, as laughing can make you seem more outgoing; if you need to laugh, make it a deep chuckle or a giggle.

Be serious.Do your homework, go to work on time, etc.
Be sweet.
Wear minimal makeup.
And if you have acne,some foundation might help...or try facial wash.

If someone says "Hi" to you that sometimes its better just to do a quick smile.
If you are in the car or sitting on the sofa try to sit on one of the edges.
Decide which parts of your personality you want to always keep on display, and which parts you want others to only catch a glimpse of.
Stay quiet...don't talk at every opportunity.This shows people you know when to talk and when you do, you have something important to say.
Often just read a book or draw.
Don't watch T.V too much.
Wear deep purples, black, deep reds, forest greens, anything with a dark flair.
Don't talk a lot about your opinions and feelings, except maybe to very close friends and family.

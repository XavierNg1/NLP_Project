Look out for obvious signs that your bra is the wrong size.
Try to measure yourself before getting fitted professionally.
Trust the band size.
Don't be stubborn.
Measure your size once a year or so.
Put your arms through the armholes.
Clasp the bra.
Adjust the straps.
Feel the bra to make sure it's positioned correctly.
Bend down.
Move your breasts into the cups.
If you find that loose skin (not the same as breast tissue) now pokes over the top of the bra, you can tuck it in and smooth it down for a smoother silhouette.

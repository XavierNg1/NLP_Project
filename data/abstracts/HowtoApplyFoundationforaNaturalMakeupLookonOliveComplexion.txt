Look at your skin.
Choose a foundation.
Once you've chosen your colour, apply it evenly throughout your face.
After applying your foundation, lightly brush on some loose powder (going in a circular motion around your skin).
After you have completed these steps, you've successfully found your perfect facial makeup for olive coloured skin!

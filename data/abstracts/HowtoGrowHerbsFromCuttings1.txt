Take a cutting from an herb plant between spring and fall, when the plants are healthy and growing steadily.
Avoid cuttings on plants that are currently flowering.
Focus on cuttings from new growth, rather than old growth.
Avoid cuttings from plants that have been overly fertilized.
Water herb plants thoroughly at least 12 hours before taking cuttings.

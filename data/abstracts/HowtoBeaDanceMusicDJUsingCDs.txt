Make sure you put out a piece of paper for requests.
Plan a "set" (a list of songs to be played) before setting foot inside a DJ booth.
Load the first selection and, simply enough, press play on the CD player, which will from hereon be referred to as deck 1, to begin playing the song.
Load the next selection into deck 2 (the other CD player).
Listen to a portion of the next track on deck 2, and try to judge the tempo and adjust the pitch/tempo fader to match the track playing on deck 1.
Start the new song in deck 2 over, and find the rough location of your cue point.
Still using your headphones ensure your songs are perfectly beat matched when you press play on deck 2.
Wait for the point in the song playing on deck 1 in which you wish to begin mixing the song on deck 2 into the mix.
Continue to switch back and forth between decks.

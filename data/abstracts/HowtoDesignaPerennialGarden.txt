Start small.
Choose the ideal garden spot.
Sketch a simple map of the location you have chosen.
Research types of perennials and decide how much time you are willing to devote to the care and maintenance of any plants you are considering.
Think about other elements you can incorporate into your garden.
Consider spacing when you are researching the plants youâ€™d like to put in your garden; many perennials multiply by themselves, so if you initially plant in every available space, your garden will soon be overcrowded.
Plant groups of similar plants together.
Note the growing heights of the plants you are considering.
Choose perennials that have a mixture of colors, shapes and foliage.

,
Factor in the blooming times of each perennial you want; that way you will have a colorful garden from spring until fall.

,
Make sure your new perennial garden can be easily reached with a garden hose.

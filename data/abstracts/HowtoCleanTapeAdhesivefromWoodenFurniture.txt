Spray the WD-40 onto the tape without trying to remove the tape first.
Spray it and let it sit for 10 or 15 minutes.
Try it both ways and decide for yourself.
Understand that if you sprayed the tape with WD-40 first, this will probably go a bit easier.
Use your razor scrapper at a very shallow angle to the wood, and gently peel the tape off.
Go slowly.
Stop and work from the other direction, always with the grain of the wood.

Understand that the first pass at removing the tape, with or without WD-40, will leave tape adhesive on the wood.
Keep in mind that the razor scrapper can be used on the softened adhesive residue very effectively.
Use a soft cloth, like a terry washcloth.

Use the most effective dental floss.
Wrap the ends of an 18-inch (46 cm) to 24-inch (61 cm) section of floss around your middle fingers.
Hold the floss between your thumbs and forefingers of both hands.
Use your thumbs to floss your upper teeth.
Gently slide the floss between your teeth.
Move the floss gently in a "C" motion when it makes contact with the gums and use a gentle up and down motion to clean the area.
Repeat the process between each tooth.
Don't forget the backs of your rear molars.
Rinse your mouth out with mouthwash or water when you're done flossing.
Floss your teeth at least once every day.
Consider other options if you can't or don't want to floss the traditional way.

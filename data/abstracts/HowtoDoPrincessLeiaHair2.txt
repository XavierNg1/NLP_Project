Brush and part your hair down the middle.
Tie your hair into two high pigtails.
Create a set of sock buns.
Slip a pigtail through one of the sock buns.
Spread the ends of your hair around the top of the sock bun.
Use both hands to roll the sock bun towards the base of the pigtail.
Secure the sock bun to your head with bobby pins that match your hair color.
Repeat the whole process for the other side's sock bun.
Spray the buns lightly with hairspray.

Find out why you might want to become a professional ballet dancer.
Once you know why you are thinking about a career in ballet dancing, judge your reasons.
If you haven't taken ballet, don't assume just yet that ballet is what you want do.
Question yourself if you really do love ballet.
If you have friends or relatives that are, have been, or are aiming to be ballet dancers, talking to them is a great idea.
If you love ballet but just don't want a career out of it, then doing ballet recreationally is certainly fine!,
If you do think that you truly love ballet, great!,
Once you are sure you really do love ballet and want to become a professional ballet dancer, talk to your teacher about your goal.
After you know that you "have it" to become a ballet dancer, audition for vocational ballet schools (if the time is right).
Try to become the best dancer you can be, but, also the best person you can be.

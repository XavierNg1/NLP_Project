Brush your hair out and make a side part.
Put all of your hair to the side of your part that has more hair.
Take a thin and wide piece from the top of your part.

,
Split the piece into five strands.
Make one normal five-strand braid stitch.
Now, you're going to go back to the strand closest to your face and repeat, but you're going to add some loose hair that's not a strand to this strand.
Continue doing these crossing movements until you run out of hair to add.
So now your braid looks cool, but it could use some more wow factor, right?,
If you want to, pull out some little hairs to frame your face.

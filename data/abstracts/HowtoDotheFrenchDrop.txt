Begin by asking a member of your audience for a coin.
Hold the coin out to your audience between your thumb and first two fingers of your left hand.

,
Pretend to pass the coin from your left to your right hand by doing the following:

Turn your left hand so that your thumb is on top with your fingers below.
Direct your gaze to your right hand (the one you wish the audience to believe holds the coin), and raise it up to your audience.
Wiggle the fingers of your right hand and open it up, to reveal it the hand to be empty.

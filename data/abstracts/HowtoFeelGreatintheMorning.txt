Start with some easy stretches.
Stretch each major part of your body: neck, arms, back, and legs.

,
Rotate your arms like a windmill one at a time, or at the same time, as it feels comfortable.

,
Do a few push-ups and sit-ups.
Hold each foot behind your lower back (one at a time), which should stretch your major leg muscles.

,
Go to a wall and push your toes up as far as they can go against the wall.
Once you have your blood pumping, you may feel a bit thirsty, or hungry.
Try to drink 2 glasses of water before you leave in the morning.
Meditate.
Go to bed early the night before, so you won't fall asleep in your breakfast or anything.
Think about things that make you happy and relaxed before you go to bed.

,
Go to the toilet before bed!

Consider your exposure to high-risk areas.
Think about how you could have contracted hookworm.
Watch for a "serpiginous rash.
Look for mild coughing or sore throat.Once you've contracted hookworm, they find their way into your bloodstream.
Notice signs of anemia.
Do not ignore stomach pain.Hookworms migrate to the intestines, so gastrointestinal discomfort is not uncommon, especially following eating.
Note that many patients do not exhibit symptoms.
Seek early diagnosis.If you live in a high-risk area, ask the doctor to make hookworm testing part of your regular checkup.
Follow the anthelmintic drug schedule your doctor prescribes.Anthelmintic drugs attack intestinal parasites like hookworms.
Refrain from scratching itchy rashes under any circumstance.
Protect your hands from fecal matter.When using the restroom, keep your hands away from your rectum.
Complete iron therapy if necessary.Because hookworms cause blood loss, an infection often results in iron-deficient anemia.
Revisit the doctor as directed.The appointment schedule may vary depending on the doctor's evaluation of your particular case.
Wash your hands thoroughly.
Always wear shoes outdoors.This is especially important if you are in a high-risk location.
Have the veterinarian check and deworm cats and dogs annually.Even if your pet was dewormed when you adopted it from the shelter, it can come into contact with hookworms at a later time.
Never let your pet lick you on the mouth.Dogs especially love to show their love by licking their human on the face, including the mouth.
Take care when handling pet feces.
Monitor children closely.Even for adults, containing a hookworm infection can be hard.
Make sure your water and food are clean and sterile.

Be polite.
Be helpful when the server asks for your drink.
Try to discern what is in your meal choice prior to asking questions.
When you receive your meal the server will wait about 30 seconds for you to check it over and make sure it's ok or if you need anything else.
Be gracious when the server checks in on you.
Move all bowls, plates, cups, and glasses no longer in use to the end of the table so the server can remove them easily.
Although you probably don't want anything after the meal, don't wait if you do because the bill is likely in the process of being tallied up if you dally.
Pay your bill promptly.
Tip correctly.

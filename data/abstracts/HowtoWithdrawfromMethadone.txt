Consider why you are quitting methadone.
Speak with an addiction specialist.
Set up a support network of friends and family.
Do not try to quit “cold turkey.” The symptoms of methadone withdrawal are painful enough that quitting suddenly is simply not realistic.
Be aware that quitting is a long-term process.
Sign up with an inpatient program if possible.
Reduce methadone use gradually.
Taper with methadone.
Maintain or taper with buprenorphine-naxolone (Subuxone).
Get counseling.
Join a support group.
Use clonidine or lofexidine to treat lingering withdrawal symptoms.While clonidine is not as effective as buprenorphine during detox, it is useful in reducing lingering flu-like symptoms such as anxiety, agitation, muscle aches, sweating, runny nose, and cramping, all of which may last up to eight months.
Ask your doctor about using trazodone, zaleplon or zolpidem to treat insomnia.
Treat the other lingering symptoms of withdrawal.

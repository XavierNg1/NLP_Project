Choose a suitable site to work from: flat, level and free from loose materials, debris or rubble.
,Check that the flip over saw is firm and does not move.
Route the power cable to the flip over saw away from the work area and not suspended off the ground in any way to cause a trip hazard.
Gather together your personal protection equipment (PPE), which should at least comprise of suitable safety glasses and a good push stick if using the flip over saw in table cutting mode.
Wear stout, steel toe capped boots, sensible clothes and tuck away anything loose that could be pulled into the blade.
Keep your material stock sited to hand and safely stacked.
Site the saw so that you don’t have to walk around it to take the freshly cut workpiece back to the work place and then stack the materials to the left hand side for convenience.
Use some kind of side supports, if cutting lengths longer than say 1 meter (3.3 ft).
Plan your work so that you minimize the amount of times that you need to ‘flip’ the saw over into table mode and back, if you can.

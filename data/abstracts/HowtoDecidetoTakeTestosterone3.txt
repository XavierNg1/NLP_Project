Stay aware of cardiovascular problems.Testosterone has the potential to negatively impact your cardiovascular health.
Look for other side effects.
Monitor your mental, physical, and sexual health for changes and side effects.Testosterone therapy can cause significant changes in your mental, physical, and sexual health, and it is important that you keep track of these changes and any side effects so that you can discuss them with your doctor during your next visit.

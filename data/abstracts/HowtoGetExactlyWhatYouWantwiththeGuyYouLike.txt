Make sure that the guy you like is single.
Flirting is such an obvious factor, but it's an important one.
Once you've started talking to him, ask questions.
Once you've started talking, try calling him - but not too often.
Once you're calling, flirt more, which will turn into a good, flirty friendship.

,
Now, if he hasn't asked you on a date; you will have to, if you really want him.

,
When you're on the date, be yourself and don't behave too couple-like yet.

,
Lean in for a kiss somewhere in the second half of the date, but only if it's right.

,
If all goes well, go on another date.

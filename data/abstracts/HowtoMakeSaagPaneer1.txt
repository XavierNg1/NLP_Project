Finely chop one yellow onion, 1-2 inches of fresh ginger, and 4-5 large cloves of garlic.
Mix up your desired spices, using cumin, turmeric, cayenne, paprika, and chili powder.
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and drop the greens in for 10 seconds, then drain.
Immediately dump the hot spinach in an ice water bath, or rise for 30 seconds under cold water.
Place 2 tablespoons ghee, butter, or oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.
Toss in your spice mixture, cooking for only 10-20 seconds, then toss in the chopped vegetables.
While the vegetables cook, chop your greens into your desired texture.
Add the greens and paneer cubes once the onions are almost translucent, or slightly see-through.
Add a half teaspoon of garam masala for a warm, spiced kicked.
Consider adding a touch of cream or yogurt if you want a creamy saag.
Serve hot over rice, only cooking the greens until up to heat.

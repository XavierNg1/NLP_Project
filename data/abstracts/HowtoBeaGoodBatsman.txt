Watch the ball as it approaches you.
Decide what shot to play.
Swing your bat straight and follow through with your swing.
Remember that timing is more important than strength.
Be straight and steady while playing.
Concentrate on the ball and pick the line and length of the ball.
Play your shot as late as possible.
Move your head first and then your feet.
Stay patient and keep calm.

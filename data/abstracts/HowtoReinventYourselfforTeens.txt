Forget the stereotypes.
Clear your mind.
Feel good about the way you look.
Try new things such as painting, art classes, play an instrument, sewing, writing, any form of creating something.
Keep a journal and reflect on your day.
Be confident, calm and kind.
Don't go crazy over a crush.
Be friendly to everyone.
Wear what makes you feel comfortable.
Do your hair and makeup differently on a date.
Don't stress over what other people think.
Don't fiddle with your hair too much.
If you like someone, do small things to make yourself look nice.

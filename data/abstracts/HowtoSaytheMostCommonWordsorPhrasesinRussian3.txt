Thank someone by saying спасибо (spAH-see-ba).
Tell someone “you’re welcome” by saying пожалуйста (pa-zhAHl-sta).
Say “it was nothing” with не за что (nye-za-shtOH).
Learn other polite phrases, like “excuse me” and “I’m sorry.” Use these phrases sparingly, because Russian don’t use them often.
Say как дела (kahk dyee-lAH) for the informal of “how are you?” Only use this with your friends or people you know well.

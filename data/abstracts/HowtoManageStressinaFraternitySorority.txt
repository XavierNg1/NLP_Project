Make friends!,
Join them.
Turn the tables on them.
Remain friendly with the jokers; it will confuse them, as if you're being tricky (which you are).
Try to get away from the situation, if it's too crazy.
Never take one upmanship or teasing personally or too seriously.
If it is a more stressful situation, take a few deep breaths, counting up to ten then back down.
If you feel like the situation is way to tense to handle inside the building, exit the apartment building and go outside.
Say I have to go, but don't tell why or where.
Discuss your problems with your landlord, resident advisor (RA), counselor, school nurse, dean or school psychologist, if you have chronic problems.
Do other stress management techniques such as breathing, yoga, visualization, etc.

If you suspect the stress might be causing (caused by) some personality difficulty (shyness or bragging), disability or illness, make an appointment with your doctor or psychologist or go talk to your college disability services to get some modifications or advice.

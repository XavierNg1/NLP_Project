There is no such thing as "drown proofing" or "safety proofing" children.
Never let children swim unsupervised.
Make your pool area safe and the pool inaccessible while you are not swimming.
If you cannot spot a child, rush to the spa or the pool first, time is crucial!,
Have a pool safety kit for your spa or swimming pool.
Never leave toys near the pool.
Consider draining your pool.
Understand that young children can drown in very shallow water.

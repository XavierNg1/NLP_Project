Don't participate in gossiping yourself.
Go to the source of the problem.
Live your life so that people will know the rumour is not true.
Be polite to the person who spread the rumour to show that you are the better person.
Deny the rumor's truth to anyone who asks.
Go to a higher authority (your principal, boss, or whatever) if you feel threatened.
Make friends with some of the spreader's friends.
Forgive, but don't forget.
Continue to live your life as if nothing ever happened.

Don't tell everyone everything about your personal life and your personal business.
Don't show the gossip-mongers you are angry, defensive, or upset.
Never tell them to mind their own business.
Be Confident.
Be strong.
If malicious gossip, rumour spreading, and lies become severe enough, not only are they forms of bullying, they can also become Human Resources issues as well.

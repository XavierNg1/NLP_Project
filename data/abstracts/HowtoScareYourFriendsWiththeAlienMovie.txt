If you haven't seen the movie "Alien", watch it before pulling this prank or even reading about how to pull it.
Have a friend or friends over one night and watch "Alien" (Rated R) late at night.
Before having any one over, you need to make your "Alien" props and costumes.

,
The first stage of the Alien is the egg.
The second stage of the Alien is the "facehugger" this creature looks like a cross between a human hand and spider.
The third stage of the Alien is the chestburster.
The final Alien stage is the actual Alien.
Right before you have everyone come over place the facehugger, chestburster, and alien costume in a room right near where you are watching the movie.

,
Start the prank by watching "Alien".

,
After you and your friends are done watching the movie, tell everyone that you need to grab some snacks, then turn off all the lights as you head to the kitchen, where you should put your "egg" in a small bag with chips and other snacks, even if they beg you not to.
Carry down the bag that contains the food and Alien egg, and when you hand it to one of your friends, act like you didn't know they egg was there.
Be the first to pick up the egg and examine it.
After your struggle with the facehugger, Pretend to fall on the floor and have the facehugger lying on your face.
Now say you need a glass of water and are very cold and go to your kitchen where the chestburster awaits.
After being drowsy and laying down on a couch, start to shake and grab your chest.
Now is the last step.
Hopefully this plan worked out!

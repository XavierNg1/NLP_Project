Buy a roasting pan, especially if you eat meat.
Prepare the meat by defrosting it completely and allowing it to sit in room temperature for 20 minutes to 4 hours, depending upon how big the roast or poultry is.
Roast vegetables by adding herbs and spices and a small touch of oil.
Baste the meat with the juice that drips from the bottom of the pan, only if it looks as though your meat is drying out.
Cover your roasting pan with aluminum foil if it looks as though the surface of your meat or vegetables are getting too crisp.

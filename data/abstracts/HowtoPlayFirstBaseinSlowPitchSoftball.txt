First base is different from the other infield positions in several ways.
Start by positioning yourself correctly.
When awaiting the pitch from your pitcher, play a little deeper than the base if it's a right-handed hitter and a few steps further back for a left-handed hitter.
When awaiting the throw from one of your infielders, as mentioned, get to the base quickly and make sure you've located the base and put your foot on it.
If a fielder throws one that's clearly going to bounce before it gets to you, position yourself low (keeping your foot on the base) almost like a catcher, ensuring that you will block the ball and maybe even catch it in your gut.
If a fielder throws wide of you, you'll need to make a split-second judgment call -- if you think you can stretch and reach the throw, then do so, keeping your foot on the base and reaching out, timing your stretch so that if you fall, it is just a second after you'll have caught the ball and recorded the out.
"Scoops" - Good first basemen make scooping low throws an art.
If a ball is hit on the ground to you and there is no one on base, make catching it your first priority.
If a ball is hit to you on then ground and there are runners on base, you have to consider a few things: A) if there is a force play at the other bases, you may want to consider throwing there to get multiple outs or to get the "lead runner" out.
TAG & BAG - This play is best used by advanced first basemen.
TAG & BAG Triple Play - With a similar scenario as above, except this time you have runners on first and second or the bases are loaded with no outs.
Backing up other positions: As a first baseman, you're involved in nearly all infield plays.

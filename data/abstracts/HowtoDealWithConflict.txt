Be prepared for strong emotions.
Don't let the conflict fester, or it tends to get worse.
Don't go into the conflict necessarily expecting bad outcomes.
Try to manage your stress during the conflict itself.
Pay attention to your non-verbal cues.
Resist the urge to overgeneralize.
Use "I" statements instead of "You" statements.
Listen for the things that really matter for the other person, and respond to them.
Manage how you react to the other person's words.
Don't hold them hostage, manipulate them, or otherwise withdraw from the situation.
Never practice mind-reading and don't jump to conclusions.We all hate the person who constantly finishes our sentences for us, because the assumption is that he knows what we're feeling better than we do.
Don't play the blame game.
Show compromise early and often.
Use safe humor to ease the situation.
Take a step back from it all if you're too caught up in the moment.
Forgive and forget.

Digest a few meager bites of food and what happens: All caloric nutrients break down into sugar because you are not eating enough (not consuming a maintenance diet).
Choose balance (for your health): Could you eat an unbalanced diet (sure!,
Ask your doctor how much and what kind of food you should eat, if your stomach were stapled or bypassed.
Consider reading the book of Dr. Alwin C. Lewis called "Why Weight Around?",
Tell yourself, "Don't to worry, plenty food will be here tomorrow, the next day, next week, next year,..." No fear!,
Consider trying the suggestion: "eat two medium-sized Snickers per day" for the first two weeks (or whatever you crave).

1 Chicken thigh, meat, large -------------- 200 cal;
1 Tortilla flour, moist, fajita size (45g) --- 90 cal;
1 Tomato, medium, cooked --------------- 25 cal;
Onion green tops, 1/2 cup, cooked ------ 20 cal;

Reflect on what "lazy" means to you.
Reflect on how your lazy self can bring you to work out how to do less.
Consider who or what benefits from the busy, ever-working you.
Know that time spent away from work could renew your energy and spirit.
Redefine productivity.
Know to stop when you’re no longer being productive.
Know that it’s okay to just spend quality time with people.
Stop all of the planning.
Be smarter about doing less.
Enjoy nature.
Allow yourself weekend lie-ins.
Shop less.
Shelve your inner busy-bee.
Simplify your life.
Let someone else do it.
Hop off the communications bandwagon.
Do things when they need doing.
Quit moaning.
Be spontaneously lazy.
Just put your feet up.

Get your camera ready.
Don't take your photos at an angle to the window.
Keep your lens close but not touching the window; vibration from the airplane will blur your shots.

Take your photos quickly, the plane is moving quickly, if you see something that you find interesting, it may be out of view the time you raise your camera.

Don't use flash photography.
Use a standard lens or a zoom lens, like a 35mm to 105mm.
Don't use a polarization filter.

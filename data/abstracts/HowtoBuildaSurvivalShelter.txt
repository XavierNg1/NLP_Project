Find a decently flat area with a tree that splits it's trunk fairly low; forming a "V" shape no further than 6' or 8' feet off the ground.
Find a long tree limb; the straighter, the better.
Place one end of the limb you found in the previous step in "V" of your chosen tree.
Find some thinner (2" or 3") sticks and limbs/branches for "the ribs" that can be leaned on the large pole (the spine) at about 45-50 degrees, and (of course) touch the ground.
Find smaller sticks that are less than or equal to about an inch in diameter.
You should now have a decent skeleton of a shelter; but it isn't suitable for sleeping in just yet.
Add all of this to the frame of the shelter in order of decreasing size until you can't find any holes you can fit fist though.
Gather extra dead leaves, pine boughs or whatever other soft/yielding materials you may have left over, and spread them over the floor of your shelter if you do not have a ground pad with you.
Test your complete lean-to shelter's stability by gingerly applying gradual weight/pressure to various places of the spine.
If you found any weak-spots, you may want to reinforce those with a couple well-placed "ribs" that are in a "Y" shape, basically forming support columns.
Admire a job well done!,
When you have your shelter and a hot, controlled fire, you may try to stand a large, flat stone (or similar object) up on the side of the fire ring to reflect heat to your shelter.

Cover your gear with a pack cover or trash bag, (if you have gear in a pack) and check-in to the "I'm warm and definitely not dead" motel!

Read the Bible and study it daily with an open mind.
Do not rebel against God's straight and narrow way: Being rebellious, people may see the light, but love darkness instead; they might seek teachers who never remind them of their own ways and things that they do -- as they continue in the "wide" path to destruction.
Seek the narrow path that the saints have trodden: 
"The path of the righteous is level; O upright One, you make the way of the righteous smooth..."Remember, this will not be easy.
Do not seek strange, wide ways, and do not seek help from strange gods .
Learn, believe, repent, be baptized, and be filled with the Holy Spirit and confess that you are saved and have found God's path.
Awaken others to the light: to believe, turn, find and continue in the path.

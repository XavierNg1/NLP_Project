Rip the denim and flannel into rectangles and squares.
Sew the equal-sized flannel and denim squares/rectangles together with the back sides together and front sides facing out.
Begin to sew the stack of denim and flannel squares together in strips when you have a stack of them sewn.
Sew the strips long edges together, with flannel sides together.
Add strips to whichever edge of your "blanket" you choose.
Sew a zigzag or satin stitch around the entire perimeter of the blanket, approximately 1.5 inches or 4 cm from the edge.

Wash and dry the blanket to fray your chenille.

Put your guitar on standard tuning.
Know your notes.
Start the tuning.
Tune the Bass E, the thickest string you have.
Tune down the E string by listening to the C bass.
Proceed to the A tuning, down to G. A is two chords higher than G (this means, G to G# then A) so it won't be as much of a problem as E going to C. Since the E is already in C, it's way down low.
Go to the D string going down C again.
Tune the G string, number three string (by counting from small e) or the number 4 if you count it from the big E. However, the G string is as is.
Tune the B string.
Finish up.

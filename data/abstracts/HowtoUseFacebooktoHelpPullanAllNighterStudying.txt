Make sure you are justified in pulling an all-nighter.
Clear your workspace of everything except your computer/laptop, books and papers necessary for studying, pencils, paper, printers, etc.
Open two windows on your laptop or computer.
For the majority of the time, keep the mundane window open.
During the break, do not engage in chat conversations you think will take forever.
Be firm with yourself.

Go outside and sit down in your own front yard or backyard.
Observe the temperature and weather and the patterns of any animals nearby.
Try to stay disconnected from any electronics that you do not absolutely need to be using once you get home.
Take up meditation.
Plant a garden.
Be kind to Mother Nature!,
Just go outside and smell the roses!

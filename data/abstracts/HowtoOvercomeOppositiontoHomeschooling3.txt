Explain how homeschooling helps build strong families.Kids who are homeschooled tend to have parents who stay more closely involved in their lives.
Explore how homeschooling improves community involvement.Since homeschooling requires less time out of a student’s day than regular education, the students have extra time they can (and do) use to give back to their communities.Homeschooled kids use the extra time in their days to volunteer at soup kitchens, recycling centers, and other community service projects.
Point out that homeschooling saves money.In private schools (and increasingly, in public schools), school uniforms – which cost $150 -$300 – can be an excessive cost on parents.

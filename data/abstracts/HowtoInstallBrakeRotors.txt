Park the vehicle on a level surface.
Start with the front wheels by placing wheel hocks (they prevent the car from rolling backwards) behind the rear wheels.
Apply pressure to the jack till it makes contact with the vehicle.
Once the jack has made contact with the vehicle loosen the bolts that hold the wheel on.
Continue jacking up the vehicle till the wheel is approximately 3 inches (7.6Â cm) off the ground.
What is in front of you now is the brake rotor, brake caliper & bracket.
Once the caliper is removed you must now remove the caliper bracket.
Remove the rotor!,
Installation is the exact reversal of this procedure.

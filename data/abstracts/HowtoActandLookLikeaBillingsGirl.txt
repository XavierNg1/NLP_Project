Look the part.
Make sure your skin is clear.
Style your hair nicely.
Make up, make up, make up.
Finally, your wardrobe.
Work on the attitude.
Also, make sure you know ALL the gossip.
Get smart.
Whoever your friends are, you're going to want to be loyal to them.
And remember, being a Billings girl is about strength, determination, loyalty, and courage.

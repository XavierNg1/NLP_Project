Misa's clothes are kind of Goth/punk, in a very Japanese way.
She is short (5') so she wears platforms and heels a lot.
Her hair is blonde, but do not feel inhibited by that, because in the live-action movie, the actress is a brunette.
You can always get a wig, if you really want to be authentic.

Misa's makeup isn't too dark; contrasting her clothes.
In the manga, a lot of her jewelry has crosses on them.

Keep your wits about you.
Create physical distance.
Assess whether or not it'll work to talk.
Ignore the insults or negative comments your opponent is flinging your way.
Avoid escalating an argument.
When trying to avoid a fight, keep eye contact and try to keep an eye on the hands.
When all else fails, turn away and leave.
Be careful when you try to walk away.

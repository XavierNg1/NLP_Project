Consider what you know of the song.
Find a friend who might know the song.Choosing the right person to help you has a lot to do with what you currently remember of the song itself.
Play or sing the melody.Find somewhere non-distracting and relatively quiet; that way, there won't be uncontrolled factors hindering the process.
Describe the other parts of the music you remember.Giving your helper some context as to the tone, rhythm and general style of the song can help them pinpoint a song just as well as any melody.
Brainstorm.Now that you've given them the melody, you and your friend can brainstorm as to what it's about.
Ask others.

Congratulations on buying your horse!,
Once your horse has settled in, time to really start having fun!,
It is not recommended to ride your horse until he has been in his new home at least 2 weeks, but you could maybe take him in the arena and lunge him to give him exercise every day you care for him.
You don't always have to ride your horse when you go places together!

Remember that insurance companies classify old horses as over 15.
Even though a horse may be old, horses age at different rates.
Remember that smaller, native breeds often live longer, such as Welsh ponies.
As your horse becomes older, his teeth will become loose and may even fall out.
Just like humans, as horses get older, they start to loose hair.
As horses grow older, they will lose condition and if they are still in work, will need to have a saddle fitter as they will be changing shape.
Older horses are more at risk of arthritis.

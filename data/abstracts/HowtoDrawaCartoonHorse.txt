Start out your drawing by marking out a half moon shaped body.
Steadily draw the neck and head.
Next comes the four long legs.
To make your sketch look a little more horse like, first add the ears and then his long head and face.
Mark out the details of his face and then his long neck.
Give him a lustrous, silky mane.
If done, draw strong thoroughbred legs, and block-like hooves at the bottom.
Put a saddle on him.
Give him a long flowing tail.
Draw in his surroundings.

Write down what perfection means to you.
Make time to help others.
Look at schooling as a chance to grow and learn, not a forced chore.
Give yourself some "me time" each day.
Enjoy the present moment, even when things are hard.
Reframe negative thoughts and experiences as positives.
Remember that life isn't perfect-- and that is a good thing.

Be Overweight


The first step for losing weight with the HCG diet is to have weight to lose.
Have the Desire To Lose Your Extra Weight


It's one thing to be overweight, but it's a completely different different thing to actually want to lose that extra weight.
Buy Your HCG Drops


There are dozens of HCG suppliers out there, but some of them offer better quality products than the others.
Begin Taking Your Drops


The HCG drops do not need to be mixed.
Start The Fat Loading Stage


This stage is very important, so please don't skip this.
Begin The 500 Calorie Diet


After your 2 fat loading days while on the drops, you will start the 500 calorie a day diet.
500 Calories A Day Without HCG Drops


The last 3 days of your 500 calorie a day diet will be without taking the drops.

Cut plastic sheeting that is approximately 15 centimeter (5.9Â in).
Place leaf on top of plastic sheeting.
Mix concrete according to package directions and then apply directly to leaf.
Cut chicken wire to leaf size and place over to the top of the concrete covered leaf.
Wrap edges and leaf in the remaining portion of the plastic, taking care to adhere plastic to design with fingers.
Peel away small pieces of leaf once design has cured.
Spray stones over the next several days as the curing process takes nearly a week to complete.

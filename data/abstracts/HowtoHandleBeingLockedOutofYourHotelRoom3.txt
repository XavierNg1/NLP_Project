Stop and think.
If no one is available to help, look for a phone or use your cell phone.
If you cannot find a phone, look for anything you can use to wear.
Look for something to cover yourself up with if nothing else is available.
If you can't find anything to cover yourself, and there are no other options, use the stairs to reach the front desk and poke your head around the door.
If there is no door, poke your head around the wall, or whatever is there.
As a last resort, take a deep breath, put your hands where you need them to be, and run to the receptionist.

Be sure it's time to get this intimate.
Check for signs of your date being at ease.
Choose the right time and place.
Make sure you're both close enough so that you donâ€™t have to reach.
If you're shy or sly, combine the arm sneak with another movement, so that it all appears seamless.
Make it fun.
Have courage but don't go over the top.

The first step is to know what your leveling up.
Next, you need to know where you stand.
Method One: start "A Rat Problem" at the Anvil Fighter's Guild.
Method Two: This method is not as effective as Method One and will probably take you a lot longer to raise your level.
Method Three: If you aren't relying on quests or add-ons, go to the sewers in the Imperial City and collect rats as in Method One.

Think about the context.
Start the conversation.
If you are at a local hangout, ask the girl if she took the day off of work to come to the beach.
If you are at a touristy beach, first ask the girl if she’s a local or on vacation.
Consider trying the classic “Do you come here often?” Try to mix it up a bit and try: “This is my favorite beach, what do you think of it?” Or you could ask her what other beaches she likes, or has been to, etc.

Keep the conversation focused on the girl.

Find any old or new cheap, clear plastic toothbrushes.
You will need boiling hot water to heat the toothbrush to a soft stage.
If you boil your water in the microwave, be aware that it may not bubble like it would on a stove.
While you're waiting for the water to boil, cut the bristles as short as you can, or pulling the bristles out with needle-nosed pliers works very well too.

,
When the water is bubbling rapidly remove it from the microwave or off the stove burner.
Take the toothbrush out of the water with tongs, and set it on a dish towel.
To prevent being burnt pick up the toothbrush using the dish towel.
Fill a bowl with ice water.
The bristle holes will widen in the heat, so now you can use tweezers to pluck out the bristles.

Enjoy wearing your new toothbrush bracelet!

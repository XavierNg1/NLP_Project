Create the Kit Kat logo and prepare the mold surface.
Melt 1/3 of the European chocolate bars.
Line the bottom of the trough with the melted chocolate.
Layer the vanilla wafers along the bottom of the hardened chocolate.
Melt the remaining European bars of chocolate using the easiest method (double boiler or microwave) and pour the chocolate over the top of the wafers.
Refrigerate the giant chocolate bar overnight.
When the chocolate has completely hardened and you have a solid bar, spread the wax paper out on a flat surface and prepare to free the chocolate from the mold.
Serve.

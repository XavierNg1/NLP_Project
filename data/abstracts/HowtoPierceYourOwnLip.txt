Before you do anything, make sure you decide if you really want to pierce your lip.
Use the appropriate equipment.
Clean your needle.
Prepare to pierce your lip: Dry your inner lip with a dry tissue or cloth so you don't salivate all over your piercing hand.
Wear clean vinyl/rubber gloves.
Start from the inside of the lip: Going through muscle tissue on the inside of your mouth is a lot easier than getting through the skin first and then going through the muscle layer.
Follow-through: For pro hollow needles, simply slip your jewelry into the end, and pull the needle out pulling the jewelry through the hole.
Go show off your new lip piercing to all your friends!,
For about three weeks there will be a discharge from your new piercing.
Finished.

Review what you're adding to the compost.
Keep the pile moist and turn it regularly.It's less like a comfortable, dry home when it's damp and getting agitated frequently!,
Visit frequently.
Review the design of the compost.
Bury food waste deeply.If rodents seem to be feasting, make it hard for them to get to the tastier morsels (the kitchen scraps) by burying them into the middle of the compost, with the other vegetation layers over the top.
Encourage local birds of prey to visit the compost heap by locating it near tree branches.
Provide plenty of physical barriers against rodents.
Harvest completed compost every three to six months.Doing so can remove potential nesting temptations from the rodents.

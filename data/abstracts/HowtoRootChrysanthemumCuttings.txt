Plant the cuttings.
Enclose the trays with the cuttings in a clear plastic bag.
Keep the cuttings in a cool, well-lit location until they take root.
Stake the established cuttings for additional support.
Allow the cuttings to harden off before planting outdoors.
Prepare the chrysanthemum's outdoor location ahead of planting.
Pinch the young chrysanthemums to encourage new growth.
Consider using the pinched off stems as cuttings.
Debud the plant a few weeks after pinching.
Cut the chrysanthemum plants back after flowering.

Familiarize yourself with the keys on the piano.
Find the A Key.
Continue depressing each consecutive white key to the right of the original A until you reach the A key an octave (12 half steps) above.
Once you have played every note in succession, and have reached the octave A, you have played an A Minor Scale.

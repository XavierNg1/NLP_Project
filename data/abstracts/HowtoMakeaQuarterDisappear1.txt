Prepare your trick.
Trace a circle around the rim of a clear drinking glass.
Cut out this circle from the paper.
Stick four tiny pieces of clear, double-sided tape to the rim of the glass at 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock and 9 o'clock.
Line up the paper as closely as you can with the rim of the glass.
Place the rigged drinking glass upside down on another piece of the same colored paper.
Begin the trick.
Drape a scarf, handkerchief, or towel over the glass.
Move the covered glass on top of the quarter, making sure the paper circle covers the quarter completely.
Remove the scarf with a flourish to reveal that the quarter has disappeared.

Make sure it has feed and/or fresh pasture every day.
Provide access to fresh water and loose mineral at all times.
Have a good health program for your pet bovine.
If you have bought a female that you want to get milk from or give birth to a calf, set up a breeding schedule for her.
Groom your bovine every day.
Make sure your pet always has access to some form of shelter.
If it's a milk cow you love, milk her on a regular schedule.
If it's a calf you have bought and are bottle feeding it, make sure it gets the proper milk replacer formula and amount per day.
Check fences regularly.

Part the hair into nine sections.
Braid the one section you have unclipped.
Repeat step two until all of the hair is in braids, then put them straight down the child's back instead of over her shoulder.
Braid the next three braids and tie, then the others.
Leave like that or make a triple-double braid updo!

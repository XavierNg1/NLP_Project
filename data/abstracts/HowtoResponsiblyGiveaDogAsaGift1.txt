Ensure the person who you give a dog to wants a dog.
Give an adoption kit.Instead of making a pet selection yourself and gifting it to someone, make a gift of dog paraphernalia like a dog bed, collar, leash, and dog bones.This will alert the recipient to the fact that you want to give the person a dog as a gift.
Think about the recipient’s lifestyle.People with limited time or mobility might not be appropriate caregivers for a dog.
Factor in the dog’s needs.Puppies often need lots of attention and training.
Know what dog the recipient wants.
Be realistic when giving a dog to a child as a gift.

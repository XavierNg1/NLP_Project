Recall the Rule of Signs.
Transform the equation in standard form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 (1) into a new equation, with a = 1, and the constant C = a*c. The new equation has the form: x^2 + bx + a*c = 0, (2).

,
Solve the transformed equation (2) by the Diagonal Sum Method that can immediately obtain the 2 real roots.
Assume that the 2 real roots of the simplified equation (2) are: y1, and y2.

,
Divide both real roots y1 and y2 by the coefficient a to get the 2 real roots x1, and x2 of the original equation (1).
Solve the transformed equation: x^2 - 11x - 210 = 0 (2).

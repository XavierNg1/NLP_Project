To paint a sky use two of the Real Color Wheel transparent primary colors, transparent cyan PB15 and transparent magenta PR122.
Wet the substrate gesso so you don't get any lines when you paint the first color in, either as an opaque or as a transparent wash. Darker cyan at the top and thin lighter cyan at the horizon line.
Paint the sky color gradient that goes from light cyan at the horizon line and an equal amount of darker cyan and magenta at the zenith.
As you get real close to the sun corona there is no cyan so that the tint of magenta is all that is seen.
Paint in the clouds over dry sky colors or wipe them out from wet sky colors.

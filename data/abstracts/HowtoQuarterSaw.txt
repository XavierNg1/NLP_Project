Select a type of wood that is suitable for quarter sawing.
Determine what size log is needed to yield the right size of boards.
Look at the characteristics of the log to tell if it is going to produce good quarter sawn lumber.
Cut the log into quarters.

,
Remove the portions of the log that are not good for woodworking.
Run one side of each quarter over a jointer to get it flat and smooth.

,
Place each quartered section on the saw carriage, which holds the log while it is being sawn, so that the annual rings of growth are between 75 and 90 degrees to the face of the resulting boards.

,
Saw the quarters so that the rays are perpendicular to the face of the board.

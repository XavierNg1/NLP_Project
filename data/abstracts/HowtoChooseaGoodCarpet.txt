Your first consideration should be about how much "traffic" you are going to have on the carpet.
Think of stain resistance.
Inquire about the rating of the carpet.
Consider wool carpet.
Man made carpets would be the best choice for heavy traffic.
Polyester is another good carpet as it is easy to clean and repels water based stains.
Color consideration.

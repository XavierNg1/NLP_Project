Look for a subject.
Steady your camera.
Set your camera to fully-automatic mode, generally designated Program (P) mode.
Play with your camera's ISO speed.
Set your camera to aperture-priority mode for a moment.
Set your lens' aperture (also called the diaphragm).
Set your camera to fully-manual (M) mode.
Play with your shutter speed.
Memorise these things.
Put your camera back into Program (P) mode for now.
Play with different lenses, if you have them.
Zoom lenses can have distortion--making straight lines not straight, typically curved--particularly at the extremes of their zoom ranges.
Get out and take pictures.
A flash has several uses.
A polarizing filter -- get a "circular polarizer" for best compatibility with autofocus lenses -- is useful under sunlight to reduce glare and brighten colors by reducing reflected sunlight, particularly making the sky dark blue.
Often you will want to have your camera produce finished JPEG format files rather than (or in addition to) unfinished but fully manipulable RAW format files.

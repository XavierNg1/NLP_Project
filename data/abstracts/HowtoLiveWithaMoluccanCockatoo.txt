Be sure your home and family is willing to accept the responsibilities and needs of the Cockatoo.
Buy a very large cage and try to get one with a play gym on the top.
Plan on buying lots of toys or making them.
Pay attention to the birds.
Good training early on in a bird's life will ensure continued acceptable behavior later on when the hormones kick in.
If you go out, leave a radio or the TV on so they have something to listen to and watch.
While some learn to talk well, they generally are the clowns and love entertaining you by dancing, flapping and swinging with loud abandon.
If you plan on taking your bird outside, buy a harness or travel cage.

Find an enclosed space for lunging, preferably a ring or small enclosed pasture.
Apply polo wraps or brushing boots to the horse before starting work.
Ideally, use a lunge cavesson.
Never leave side reins tight when the horse is walking.
Prepare the lunge line, by folding it back and forward over itself, not by coiling around your hand.
Practice using the lunging rein and whip until your are comfortable with them and can handle them nimbly.
Snap the lunge rein to the center ring of the cavesson.

Whips may 'only' be used as an aid, never as a tool to harm, injure, or frighten the horse.

Open Adobe Photoshop Elements and create a new file.
For each frame of your animation, create a layer.
Once your frames are done, set the layer visibility so that ALL the layers are VISIBLE.
Go to File>Save for Web.
Check the box that says "Animate.",
Click "Preview in Default Browser.",
If your animation doesn't look quite how you expected, click "Cancel" and make necessary changes to your frames.

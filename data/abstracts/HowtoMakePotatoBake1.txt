Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C) and lightly grease the inside of a 2.5-quart (2.5 liters) baking dish.
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat.
Stir in the flour, then cook it for about 2 minutes, or until it starts to bubble.
Take the saucepan off the stove, then slowly stir in the milk.
Cook the mixture over medium heat until it starts to boil.
Stir in 1½ cups (150 grams) of cheese.
Spread a third of your potatoes across the bottom of the dish.
Season the potatoes with salt and pepper, then pour a third of the cheese sauce over them.
Sprinkle the rest of the cheese on top.
Bake the potatoes, uncovered, for 1 hour.
Allow the potatoes to cool slightly before serving them.

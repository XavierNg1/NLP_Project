Decide what kind of fight you want it to be.
Make sure that the person you cast, if not having had training in that particular martial art, can at least pull off some of the moves.
While shooting, do not make the fight continuous.
Make sure you have some funky moves in your fight.
Speed or slow down the camera shot to give a feel to a particular move.
Finally make sure you film the fight from all angles possible.

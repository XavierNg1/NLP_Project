Consider that the amount of 3D programming is still limited.
Also, acknowledge that buying a 3D TV does not mean you have to dispose of your 2D TV.
Now that you have counted the problems, look at the prices.
To view 3D TV at the moment, your set may involve bulky glasses that cost $150 dollars.
If you are ready to compromise with all these things, try going for more trusted and higher-quality brands.

Teach pronunciation first.
Focus on the pronunciation of accents and stress marks in words.

Teach informal and formal pronouns as necessary.
Provide vocabulary for common situations.
Focus the classroom on speaking Spanish.
Teach full sentences and common expressions.
Vary classroom activities.
Bring Spanish or Mexican culture into the classroom.
Tailor teaching to the skill level of a student group.

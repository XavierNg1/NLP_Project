Over exaggerate your actions.
Randomness is great!,
Dye your hair with a different, crazy colour.
Have a huge but freakish evil grin on your face.
Have a new fake personality.
Go to the real extreme!,
Alternatively, if you are already known for being slightly crazy, a good way to freak people out would involve acting dull and morose, and uttering things under your breath.
Have imaginary friends.

Use a disk sander with an adjustable angle to sand the ends of your work pieces (boards) until the "fit" is acceptable.
Get a random orbital disk sander to sand your finished product, or use a sanding block sanding.
Begin with a suitable sandpaper grit.
Sand in the direction the grain is running.
Apply stain, paint, or sanding sealer, and allow to dry.

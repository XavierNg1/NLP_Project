Understand that racing is an art, not just a game.
Train often and train well.
Increase the distance you run every running day until you are up to a high distance.
Be ready to race.
Get ample rest the night before your race.
Always do a quick warm-up before you run.
Ensure that there will be a drink with you or close by for long races.
Clear your head and stay relaxed at the starter line of the race.
Start off with your head down for about the first five metres.
Avoid burning out in the beginning.
Keep your knees up every time that you run.
Stay focused.
Always look straight ahead.
Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Don't run with fists.
Adjust your stride according to the distance you're running, if it's a sprint then quickly turn over your legs and keep your knees high.
Avoid expending bursts of energy, unless strongly needed.
Stay on the inside of the track.
Get ahead of the main pack ahead of time.
Find someone who is running slightly faster than you.
Be confident.

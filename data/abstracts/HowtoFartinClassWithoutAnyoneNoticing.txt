Do not freak out!,
Clinch your anus when you feel your stomach growl.
Wait until the teacher starts talking before you fart.
Lean forward on your chair, so that your torso is on the table and your butt is puckered out (your butt cheeks will be split so the fart won't be able to flap between them).

,
Slowly let the fart come out.

,
Once the fart is over, sit upright in your chair and begin to sniff the air.

,
Never say "Who farted?"

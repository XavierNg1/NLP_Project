Take half of the deck and fold it in half lengthwise, so the back side of cards in on the outside.
Turn the second half of the deck upside down and fold it in half, so the front of the cards is on the outside.
Faro Shuffle the deck so that every other card is bent in half.
Square up the deck so that it resembles a normal, shuffled deck.

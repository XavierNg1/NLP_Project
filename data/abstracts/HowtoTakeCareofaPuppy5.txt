Begin house training your puppy immediately.
Pick a spot outside that is easy to get to, easy to clean, and that other dogs don't have access to.
Look for early signs that you puppy needs to go.
Stick to a feeding routine.
Hook your puppy to its leash and try walking around in the chosen area.
Use the word "go" to help to teach your puppy to go in their potty area.
Distract, don't punish, a puppy that goes to the bathroom inside.

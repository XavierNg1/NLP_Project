If you're 25, there are agencies who will still consider you for high-fashion depending on how well you've aged, so make sure to take excellent care of your skin, invest in a good eye cream and moisturizer, and stay out of the sun!,
If you're over 25 and believe you still look young enough to try it, submit your photos to reputable agencies through their websites or snail-mail.
Be honest with yourself.
If you're over 25 and have ruled out a career in high fashion, or an agent advised you to go commercial, by all means, listen to him/her and GO COMMERCIAL!

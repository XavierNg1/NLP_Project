Consider the situation confronting you.
Consider your effort vs. the payoff in your current situation.
Realize that giving up on something in our lives can be a way of shutting one door and opening numerous others.
Don't listen to people who have no other advice than to "keep with it.",
Be open about your change of plans and use positive language about your decision to quit.
Expect doubt to visit now and then.
Know that you are not someone who gives up generally.

Preheat the oven to 350ºF/180ºC and grease two cake tins.
In one bowl, mix together 1/2 cup of vegetable oil, sugar, and the beaten eggs.
Mash the bananas into the milk and vanilla and then mix in.
In a different bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Slowly add the dry ingredients to your wet ones, mixing the entire time.
Fill both pans equally with batter.
Bake for 35 minutes, or until the cake looks golden brown.

Write the polynomial, (1/r)(x + x2 + ... + xr).
Raise this polynomial to the nth power to get the corresponding generating function for the sum shown on n dice.
Computationally, this is equivalent to the previous method, but sometimes theoretical results are easier to derive with a generating function.

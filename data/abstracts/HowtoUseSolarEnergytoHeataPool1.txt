Use a long, dark-colored hose to fill up your pool.
Make sure the hose is in direct sunlight.When filling your pool, make sure the hose gets full sun exposure to absorb as much energy as possible.
Fill the pool slowly with a thin hose.A thinner stream of water will heat more quickly when filling your pool.

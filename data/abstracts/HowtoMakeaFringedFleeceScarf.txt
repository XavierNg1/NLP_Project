Buy 3 types of fleece at the craft store or online.
If you bought more than the minimum amount of fleece, cut 3 pieces of fleece with fabric scissors or a rotary cutter and a self-healing mat.
Align the 3 pieces of fabric exactly.
Place the top, middle section of the fleece beneath the presser foot.
Lay the fleece strip on a craft table.
Cut slits on the opposite side.
Fluff the fringes of the scarf so that all 3 layers show.

Spend a long, long time looking at things with a sense of wonder.
Giggle often, but keep it to yourself.
Touch a lot of things, rubbing them to enjoy the variety of textures.
Get deep and philosophical about our shared experience and place in the universe.
Consider throwing a fake "bad trip," complete with a mental breakdown, if you're a true actor.

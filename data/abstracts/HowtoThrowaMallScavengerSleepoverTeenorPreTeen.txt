First, create a list of tasks or riddles you want the party guests to solve.
After time is up, the points will be added.
Then you and your daughter will have to make some decisions.
After you have made a decision, ask your daughter who she wants to invite.
You will need to provide the guests with a few things.
Next, decide if you are comfortable or not with the girls wandering the mall by themselves.
Finally, send out the invitations to the guests.
If the party guests will be going to your home at any point during the party, make sure your home is clean and comfortable.
Before the scavenger hunt starts, go over the rules of the scavenger hunt and how the scavenger hunt works.
Have fun!!!

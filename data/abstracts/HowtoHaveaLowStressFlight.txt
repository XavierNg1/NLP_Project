Book in advance: If you book in advance, you are more likely to get the seat you want and have a cheaper ticket, as last-minute tickets can be very expensive and you could end up in a rather undesirable seat.
Either check or ship your luggage: take as few carry on items as possible, this reduces the number of items you have to keep track of.
Arrive at the airport AT LEAST one hour prior to scheduled departure to avoid stress due to long lines at baggage checking and security.
Wear layers: wear short sleeves with a sweater or jacket.
As soon as you board: TURN OFF YOUR OVERHEAD VENT!,
When you land: Do not make a mad dash for the exit.
When connecting: Make sure you give yourself at least 30 minutes between connecting flights.
Keep your destination in mind!

Before you attempt to correct a dog's behavior make certain you have established yourself as the dominant member of the family or pack.
Never feed your dog from the table, TV tray, or from your plate.
If you and your dog haven't yet established dominance, this may be a problem area to begin addressing this issue.
If you've established dominance, you can allow the dog to be in the same room with you but keep put the dog into a down position.
As my professional trainer told me, you get the dog you deserve.

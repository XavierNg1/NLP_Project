Make sure to warm up with very light weight for the muscle group you are about to train, maybe get ten easy minutes on the treadmill.
Practice perfect form.
Know that the eccentric (resisting phase) of the movement is the most important one and the concentric (pushing/pulling phase) is secondary when it comes to results.
Start slowly to allow your body to adapt.
Breathe.

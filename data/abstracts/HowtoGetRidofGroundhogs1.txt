Do your research.
Wear gloves when handling the trap, to keep your scent off it.
Bait the trap with fruits or vegetables.Groundhogs particularly like cantaloupe, but if you have noticed anything disappearing especially quickly from your garden you can use this as well.The bait should be placed as far back as possible, to ensure that the groundhog must enter the cage fully in order to reach it.
Camouflage the trap.
Check the trap regularly.
Release the groundhog.

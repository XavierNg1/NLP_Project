Heat the oven to 350ÂºF.
Beat together butter and sugar with a hand mixture.
Add eggs and vanilla, mixing until completely incorporated.
In a separate bowl, whisk up the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
Slowly mix the flour mixture into the butter mixture.
Stir in oats and raisins with a rubber spatula.
Drop rounded balls onto your lined or greased cookie sheet.
Bake 10-12 minutes, until golden brown but still soft.
Cool the cookies on a wire rack for 1-2 minutes on the sheet, then move to wire racks and serve.

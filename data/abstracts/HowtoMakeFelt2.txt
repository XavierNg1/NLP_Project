Pull apart some raw wool into tufts.
Fill a small tub with hot water and add some liquid dish soap into it.
Gather a few tufts into a ball, then roll them between your palms.
Soak the ball in the hot, soapy water.
Roll the ball between your palms until it becomes firm.
When the wool is firm, rinse it off with cold water.
Gently press the ball in a towel to remove excess water.
Allow the felt ball to air dry.
Consider threading the balls onto some twine to make a garland.Poke a hole through each ball using a darning needle, and pull some heavy thread through it.

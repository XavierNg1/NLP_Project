Pick an e-liquid for your vaping pleasure.
Create a plan to reduce the nicotine level over time.Every two or three months, adjust the e-liquid you’re using to one with a nicotine level lower than the one you’re currently using.For example, if you’re using an e-liquid with a 16 mg nicotine level, choose an e-liquid that has 11 mg of nicotine.
Think of the e-liquid as you would the tobacco in a traditional cigarette.

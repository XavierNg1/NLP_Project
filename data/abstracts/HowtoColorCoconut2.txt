Pour the tablespoon of water into a suitably sized jar with a wide mouth (if you have a mason jar, that will do nicely).
Shake the jar to distribute the color through the water.
Add the coconut to the colored water.
Dry the coconut.
Repeat for each of the remaining colors.
Store each color separately.
Mix the colors just before use.
Use the colored coconut.

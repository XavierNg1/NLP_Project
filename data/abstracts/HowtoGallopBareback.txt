First, make sure you are comfortable with all the gaits in a saddle, and in bareback which include the walk, the trot, sitting trot, and canter.
Make sure your horse is warmed up.
Ask your horse to canter on flat, level ground.
When you are relaxed and your horse is collected, ask for the gallop by squeezing with both legs, and keep your legs against the horse so the horse doesn't quit on you.
Remember not to slam on your horse's back.

,
Your pelvis should be moving with your horse in a scooping motion.
Have fun galloping bareback on your horse!

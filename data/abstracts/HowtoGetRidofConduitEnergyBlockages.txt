Focus on the present: Buddha has said, “"Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.” You can easily get swallowed up by your sorrows and your regrets, by things you wished you had done and by events which may have shaped you today.
Be realistic: You may have very high hopes or expectations.
Look inside yourself.

Use the embroidery hoop as your "loom".
Cut an old T-shirt into one-inch-wide loops.
Stretch the loop one by one over the embroidery hoop, or hula hoop, spacing them evenly.
Attach the first weft by looping it over a warp and then through itself.
Connect another weft or two using the same method - looping them through the previous weft, then through themselves.

,
Begin weaving the weft over and under.
Begin treating each warp as 2 separate ones, dividing each individual loop.
Continue weaving and adding warps.
When the mat is the desired size, cut you last weft loop.
Cut the warps one at a time.
Finished!

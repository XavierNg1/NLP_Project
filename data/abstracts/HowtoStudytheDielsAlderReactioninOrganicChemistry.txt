Investigate about the Diels-Alder reaction's discovery by two chemists in Germany that were awarded the Nobel Prize for its discovery.
Master the theory as the fundamental to understanding reactions in the organic lab as well as in inorganic chemistry also.
Use knowledge of the Diels-Alder reaction theory in predicting correctly, in many cases, that reactivity of organic compounds is governed by the highest occupied molecular orbital in the molecule and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital which are called HOMO and LUMO respectively.
Plan to setup your reaction to collect data on two reacting components involved in the Diels-Alder reaction.
Read theoretical and experimental studies on many systems with various types of substituents.
Examine the impact of substituents on organic compounds in general that can have dramatic effects on the electronic properties of the compound and on its chemical reactivity.

Tattoos hurt.
If you have a low tolerance for pain, or this is your first tattoo, choose a simple design, and place it in an area that has few nerve endings and will take ink well.
However, if you are feeling daring, or would like a tattoo to evoke more of a "rite of passage" feeling, more sensitive (and often more sensual) areas are easily available.

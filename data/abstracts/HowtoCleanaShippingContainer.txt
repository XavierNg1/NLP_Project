Make sure that any dirt, dust, or other forms of detritus are removed from your shipping container.
If you have access to a pressure washer, or can borrow or rent one, it will expedite the cleaning process greatly.
Inspect both the inside and outside of the shipping container for signs of rust or corrosion.
Once the container is completely dry, inside and out, go over the shipping container with a medium grit sandpaper.
After youâ€™ve finished sanding your shipping container, apply a primer coat of paint.
Finally, after the primer coat is dry apply a thick, exterior paint to the inside and outside of your storage container.

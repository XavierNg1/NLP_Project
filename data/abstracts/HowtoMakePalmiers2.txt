Cut 20 tablespoons of butter into 1/2-inch cubes and freeze for 20 minutes.
Combine 4 cups flour with 2 teaspoons of salt in a kitchen mixer.
Add 7 tablespoons of softened butter and 3/4 cup ice cold water to the mixer and combine on low until everything is loosely together.
Add in the cold butter chunks and mix with your hands.
On the plastic wrap, use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a 10-20" rectangle.
Wrap the plastic wrap around the dough and chill it for an hour.
Fold the short ends of the rectangle in until they meet in the middle.
Fold the dough in half, hotdog style, so that you have four layers of dough stacked up.
Chill the folded dough for 15 minutes, then roll it back out to a 10-20 rectangle.
Repeat the 4-way fold, chill for 1 hour, and then repeat 2 more times.
Chill for at least an hour before using.

Begin to bid.

When melding, remember that you can have a single card that's part of more than one meld, but that when you lay down the melds you can't have a card that's part of two of the same type.
Figure out if the person who won the bid can make their total with the addition of trick-taking points.
Now, with your leftover cards, you begin the process of trick-taking.
Combine your points with your partner's and you've finished your first round of Pinochle.

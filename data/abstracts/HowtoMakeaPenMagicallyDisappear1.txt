Pull a pen out of your pocket and hold it in your right hand.
Hold your left palm up in front of you.
Hold the pen near its tip and raise it beside your head.
Tap the pen against your left hand and gesture toward your head once more.
On the third time, place the pen behind your ear.
Fluidly and swiftly clap your right hand against your left.
Decide if you'd like to make the pen reappear.

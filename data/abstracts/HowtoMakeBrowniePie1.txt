Make brownie mix in a pie pan.
Make chocolate pudding.
Mix the pudding with about two-thirds of the brownies you scooped out earlier and half of the tub of whipped cream.
Take the other half of the tub of whipped cream and spread it over the top.
Stick the entire pie into the fridge until it's completely cooled.

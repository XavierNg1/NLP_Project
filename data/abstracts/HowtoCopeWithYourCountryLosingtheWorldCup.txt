Get over it.
Think over how badly your team played.
Think about how incredible it is that they qualified themselves for playing in the World Cup at all.
Stay positive.
See things from another point of view.
Watch recaps of your favorite games, and matches won by your country.
Look for other sports that your country is good at.
Distract yourself.

To get beautiful looking baseboards quickly, you need to use the right supplies.
Use standard latex paint for your baseboards.
Mask the baseboards.
To mask the baseboards, run a strip of tape along the top where the baseboard meets the wall.
Lay some 4mm gauge plastic on the floor, running it around the edge of the baseboard.
Pour 1⁄4 gallon (0.9 L) of paint into a paint tray.
Holding the pad vertically, run the pad along the baseboard.
Keep dipping the pad into the paint.
Wait at least 4 hours before pulling off the masking tape.

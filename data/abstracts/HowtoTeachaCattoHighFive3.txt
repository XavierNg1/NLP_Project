Sit on the floor facing your cat.
Hold the target above the cat’s head, out of reach of its mouth and nose.
“Click+treat” any movement of a paw at first.
Begin to inch your hand towards the tip of the target.
Replace the target with just your hand.
Add a verbal cue while the cat is reaching out its paw.
Move your hand positioning down incrementally so that your palm faces the cat at about eye level.

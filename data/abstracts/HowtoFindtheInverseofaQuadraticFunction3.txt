Remember the Quadratic Formula for solving x.
Begin with a quadratic equation to find the inverse.
Graph the equation to define the domain and range.
Interchange the variables x and y.
Set the left size of the equation equal to 0.
Redefine the variables to fit the Quadratic Formula.
Solve the Quadratic Formula using those redefined values.
Write out the two possible solutions.
Define the domain and range of the inverse function.
Check that your inverse function works.

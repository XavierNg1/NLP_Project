Xat.com is a free chatting website.
You'll see that on the bottom box of the chat box, there is a space to type something.
The box above the line of emoticons is the place where you can see what people posted.
The box beside that is where you see the number of people that are on the chat box.
Look to the left hand side of the chat box.
Have fun!

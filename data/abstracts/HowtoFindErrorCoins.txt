Sort coins according to denomination types.
Examine the façade of the coin and its inscriptions, it is important to focus on the lettering and look for anything unusual or odd.
Focus also on the mint-mark and the date indicated on coins, this is considered one of the greatest finds in errors in coins.
Check major details on both face sides of the coin like portraits, structures, and the like.
Systematically and slowly inspect the coin turning it from the top to the bottom not from one side to another.
Don’t miss out on the edges of coins, using your palm roll the coin in order to have the chance to inspect all of the edges.
Always set aside coins that give you even a little suspicion, if one is busy but spots or suspects that there is something odd with a certain coin set it aside for further inspection later.

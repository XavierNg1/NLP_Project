Go to the Emergency Department.In the case of a severe burn, smoke inhalation, or a fire, bring your child to the Emergency Department as soon as possible.
Ensure adequate hydration.In the case of severe burns that require medical attention, your doctor will recommend keeping your child well-hydrated while the burn heals.
Obtain skin grafts as needed.In very severe burns that cover a large surface area, plastic surgeons may need to use what are called "skin grafts" (pieces of skin that are sewn over the area of the burn) to help with healing.

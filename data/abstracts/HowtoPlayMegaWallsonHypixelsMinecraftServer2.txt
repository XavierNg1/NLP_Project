After 10 minutes, you'll get a ding to prepare for battle.
If your Wither is in danger from another team member, you'll get dings that the Wither is under attack.
If you chose a class, you should have a skill.
As the Withers' health levels begin to run down, they will become 'no longer enraged', meaning that they no longer give regeneration to the defending team.

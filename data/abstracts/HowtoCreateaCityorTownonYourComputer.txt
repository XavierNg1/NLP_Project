Create a folder (NOT inside the City Hall) and give it a residential neighborhood address.
Create more houses for more people, but focus on the person representing you.

Build different rooms in your house, as well as everyone else's house.
Use the other residents, or even yourself, to build stuff, such as homes to sell, or a store, or even a research center.
Use more than just the basics, be creative, for example, don't just sell textbooks, name them, that way you're selling notebooks, checkbooks, journals, etc...

Research is one of the most important things.

Realize that there are "right to work states," "the free press" and "freedom of religion" that guarantee areas that are outside of some various kinds of government force.
Research, on the Internet, for example educate yourself by reading many different sources and consider calling your state representative, and get news releases about such laws as they occur in your state.
Find out whether your state is a "union state" or a "right to work state," and learn about any related laws and current legislation and similar matters.

,
Get legal help, if your government has or begins putting unionism into your business/home-businesses: this could be related to healthcare or childcare, and other matters as government provides.
Consider learning about and even joining class-action lawsuits if applicable to you.
Help to work against unionism in your state which you think is possibly unconstitutional.
Consider researching about right to work organizations who may provide free legal advise or aid to those in such unionism.

Join one or more similar organizations formed of (concerned) citizens such as yourself, which may possibly support related law suits/class actions.
Consider seeking, supporting, and working in campaigns for candidates who oppose/or favor compulsory unionism and your views on worker rights, and decide how to vote for your candidates!

Remove everything from the room.
Cover the floor with plastic sheets.
Paint the ceiling first.
Wait until the ceiling paint has finished drying.
Cover the ceiling near the wall with painter's tape.
Place one end of the first strip in the corner of the ceiling, right where the ceiling meets the wall.
Slowly drag the tape along the length of the ceiling in a straight line, pressing it down firmly until it lies flat against the ceiling.
Repeat the taping process with as many strips of tape you need.
Pour 1 or 2 cups (250 to 500 milliliters) of wall paint into a small bowl.
Dip a small angled brush into the paint.
Lay your paintbrush flat against the wall, starting at a corner of the room.
Drag the brush down 2 inches (5 centimeters) from the top of the wall.
Use the brush to paint along the entire perimeter of the room.
Proceed with painting the wall as usual, but allow the paint to dry before removing the tape.

Have the child put their feet onto the pedals and begin pedaling slowly.
Push gently and help them increase speed enough that the bike could remain upright without support.
Ask the child if they are comfortable and feeling safe.
Let go of the bike gradually, but walk or run alongside the bike so your child knows you are still there.

Ride with them or walk alongside for the first several times they go out on their bike.
Use the "towel method" to teach your child how to balance on the bike.

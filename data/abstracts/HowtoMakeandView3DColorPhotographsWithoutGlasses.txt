Have what you need.
Take the picture.

If this fails for you, you can avail yourself of any of several ways of viewing separate 3D images.
Bear in mind that the basic idea here is that you can take 3D photographs of static scenes with a single camera, no special equipment required, and with moving scenes using a pair of identical cameras mounted on a rig (both to be triggered simultaneously either by using two fingers or a split cable-release).

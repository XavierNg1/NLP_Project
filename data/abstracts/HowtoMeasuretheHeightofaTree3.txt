Use this method as an alternative to the shadow method.
Stand far enough from the tree so you can view the whole tree—top to bottom—without moving your head.
Hold a pencil at arm's length.
Close one eye and adjust the pencil up or down so that you can sight the very top of the tree at the top of the pencil.
Move your thumb up or down the pencil so that the tip of your thumbnail is aligned with the tree’s base.
Rotate your arm so that the pencil is horizontal (parallel to the ground).
Have your friend move so that you can sight him or her “through” the point of your pencil.
If you have a tape measure with you, measure the distance between your friend and the tree.
If you don't have a tape measure with you, mark the height of your friend and the height of the tree on the pencil.
Find the answer once you have access to a tape measure.

Having a "poker face" is commonly misunderstood.
Always remain calm and act the same every hand.
Never go nervous ticking you chips on the table, picking your nose, pulling your hair, biting your nails.
Always look your opponent right in their eyes when they look directly at you.
Never say: "I know you are bluffing" or something similar because if you then make a move no matter what your opponent knows how you react to such situations and that will definitely not work the way that you thought it would.

Avoid Jammers that say, "If you like me, come to my den!",
Make yourself ugly.
If there is an animal that has the skin color (light orange/peach) on with no clothing and wants you to come to their den or do something with them, don't do it.
If you are a boy or girl and an animal with the opposite gender sleeps or hops right in front of you, they may want you to mate with them.
Report, block, and leave.

Decide which kind of Chicago style formatting you should use.While APA and MLA are used by different types of disciplines, Chicago can be used by a wide range of writers.
Place footnotes at the bottom of the page.When using the notes-bibliography system, you show that you want to cite a quote, idea, or other content by using a footnote.
Put endnotes after the body of the paper.A second way to format the notes-bibliography system is to point the superscript notes in-text to a full bibliography at the end of the document.
Format your notes properly.Notes are single-spaced, but you should skip lines between entries.
Shorten the note for each source after the first usage.If you use a source on the first page of your paper, then again on the 10th, then again on the 14th, your notes will get bloated with repetitive information.
Create a bibliography.The bibliography in this style is optional because all the sources are cited in notes already.
Format the bibliography entries properly.Unlike the notes, information in the bibliography entries are separated by periods instead of commas.

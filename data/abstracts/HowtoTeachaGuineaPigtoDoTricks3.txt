Place your guinea pig in a piggy-proof area that both of you are comfortable in.
Hold a treat - or, if your pig has learned targeting, a finger - above the guinea pig's head.
Once your guinea pig stands up on its hind legs, allow it to drop back down to all fours, and then click or use the verbal marker and treat.
Continue to do this until your guinea pig does it correctly every time.

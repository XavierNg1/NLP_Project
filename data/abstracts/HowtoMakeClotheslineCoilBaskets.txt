Plan out the general shape of the object you wish to make.
Cut long strips of fabric, about 1 centimeter (0.4Â in) wide and as long as the fabric permits.
Wrap the fabric strips around the clothesline in a spiral.
Begin coiling the clothesline into the shape you'd like the finished piece to be.
Machine sew a zigzag stitch across the space between one wrap and the next.

,To create walls, simply tilt the finished coil up as you sew.

Decide on a budget.
Look around your room and write down what you want to keep, even if you would like to improve an item you already have (i.e.
All the things that you don't want to keep, give them to a sibling, charity, or sell them.
Think about lighting options, such as chandeliers, lamps, sconces, and windows.
Decide what new things you want.
Decide what size bed you are getting.
Think about what companies you trust for your furniture/paint.
Choose a theme.
Make a room plan.
Get the walls painted first, you need to figure out whether the bedding will work with it or not.
Buy the bedding theme.
After buying the bedding, buy the mattress/bed.
Buy the curtains/shades.
If everything coordinates, buy new lighting.
Buy an armoire/dresser.
Buy the chest if you want.
Buy a nightstand if you want.
Buy the bookshelf and table.
Finally buy the accents, and voila-you're done!

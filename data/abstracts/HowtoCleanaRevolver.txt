Make sure the gun is unloaded.
Lay the gun and supplies on a workspace with a clean, lint-free blanket.
(optional) Cover up the rear cylinder opening with a sock.
Dip the right size bore brush into your cleaning solvent.
Slide the brush into the barrel, letting it twist naturally with the gun.
Remove the brush and attach a clean lubricated patch to the patch tip.
Use 2-3 dry cleaning patches to dry out the barrel and remove any last grime.
Remove the sock and clean the muzzle and rear cylinder.
Use your bore brush and some solvent to clean up and down each cylinder.
Use the cleaning patches -- one with solvent, 2-3 dry -- to clean the cylinders just like the barrel.
Put a small amount of gun oil on a clean cloth and wipe down all metal surfaces.
Wipe off all excess oil with another clean rag.

Drive teeth can get terribly misaligned because of worn gear teeth.
With your Blu-ray drive open, remove the platform that holds the rollers.
Twist the white gear denoted with the yellow clockwise sign until the the gear separates from the black platform on the left side of the drive.
Realign the black platform and twist the white gear counterclockwise until the two catches are fully raised.
Pull the rollers outwards as the pink arrows indicate and screw the roller platform back onto the drive.
Insert a junk CD along the top half of the drive as though the drive were accepting it.
While holding the CD in its loaded position, pop the top half of the Blu-ray drive onto the bottom half.
Screw everything back together, boot up your PS3, and eject your CD.

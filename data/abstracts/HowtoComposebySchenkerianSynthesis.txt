Take any melody you like, or two part composition you like.
Eliminate every repetition.
Reduce every harpeggio (obvious such) to a chord.
Eliminate every note in top voice which only serves to lead between two notes.
Eliminate every note in top voice which juts out below or above a note and then gets back to it.
Understand how the bass progression should work.
Reduce to its parts any chord not accounted for by bass progression as described above if:

a) it is a dominant to it (D G reducing to G, Dm G reducing to G, Am Dm reducing to Dm ...),
b) it is a sequence of subdominant or double dominant and dominant to it (C D G reducing to G, A Dm G reducing to G), or,
c) either bass or top voice includes a note according to 4 or 5 (between two different notes if leading between them, between two repeats of same note if a neighbour to them) which is integral to the chord which can otherwise not be explained.
Apply above to many different melodies and pieces (some may involve also repeating parts over other octave registers or extending voices theoretically between top voice and bass to above theoretical top voice, but those are more complicated pieces of Classical Music, generally).Start out with a top voice descent as described above, and fit it with a bass progression, also covered above.Add repetitions, filling out of voices between bass and top voice, notes that lead between notes, notes that lead from and back to a note, chords that depend on such notes, after taste.Add more, until you have what you consider a sound melody.

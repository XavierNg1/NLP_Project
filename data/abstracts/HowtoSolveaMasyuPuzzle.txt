Look for any of these local conditions and draw the appropriate inferences:


A black circle on the edge or one square away from the edge must extend toward the center.
Reapply the above conditions again and after any significant progress.
Look at the endpoints of each segment of the path.
A white circle two cells away from a black circle can impose a restriction since it the path extends from the black circle to the white circle it is forced to immediately turn.
Look for any region that is almost closed off from the rest of the puzzle.
Continue to look for obstructions similar to those above created by the new parts of the path drawn.
As most of the solution gets filled in, switch from thinking locally to thinking globally.

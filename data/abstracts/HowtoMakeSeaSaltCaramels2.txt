Prepare your baking pan.
Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat.
Stir in the sugar, salt, corn syrup, and milk, then bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly.
Reduce the heat to medium-low, clip a candy thermometer to the saucepan, then continue to cook until it reaches 248°F (120°C).
Take the saucepan off the stove, stir in the vanilla extract, then pour it into the prepared baking pan.
Refrigerate the caramel for 1 hour, or until it has completely cooled.
Melt the chocolate chips and vegetable oil in the microwave.
Spread the chocolate over the caramel.
Sprinkle the coarse or flaked sea salt over the chocolate, then refrigerate until the chocolate has set, about 30 minutes.
Use the parchment paper to lift the caramel out of the baking pan, then cut the caramel into rectangles.
Serve the caramel.

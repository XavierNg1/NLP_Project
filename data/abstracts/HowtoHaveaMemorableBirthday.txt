Choose a site in nature.
Throwing a party at a restaurant is another common way that we choose to celebrate our birthdays.
Decide on the place at least 20 days before your birthday event, so that you get enough time for other preparations.

,
Avoid party halls.
Many restaurants have such arrangements where you can enjoy the nature too, along with your celebration.

,
Although you will go at a perfect natural destination, celebrating at a party hall won't give you the different experience that you want to have.
Decide on the right time.
Decide whom to invite.
Inviting someone just for the sake of formality doesn't work.
Create a card.
Set up a daytime party.
Set up a nighttime party.
Choose a different dish.
Make sure that you have something sweet and delicious to serve.
If you have decided to have some games for fun, then don't plan a heavy dish.
Add a cake and candles.
Do a good deed.
If you have an environment-friendly nature, then plant trees and help save the environment.

Remember that happiness increases when you make others happy!

Gather your equipment (Amp, Subs, Stereo, and wiring).
Run your amp wires (battery, ground).
Detach the power cable from the battery and attach your amp's power wire to the power cable for your vehicle; leave it unattached.
Place the amp where you want it, then attach the ground (black or brown) wire to the amp.
Now for the RCA jacks, If your using a after market stereo on the back there is 2 RCA jacks, just run the RCA from there to the "IN" on your amp and try to avoid running RCA jacks alongside power lines to minimize noise.

,
If you're going to use your stock stereo and run the amp from there you want to buy a Line Out Converter ~$20.
Now for the Remote (blue wire).
Use a capacitor to prevent voltage drops caused by deep bass hits, i.e. lights dimming with the beat.
Run the power wire to your amp.
Run your sub wires to the amp and screw them in.

,
Turn the gain all the way down, start playing music and turn it up to where you usually listen, where the mids sound good.
RMS is very important when matching subs and amps, yes not enough power will make subs clip, but also to much power will burn your voice coils by over heating them with too much power .

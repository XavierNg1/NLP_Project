Decide what your monster is going to look like; will he have wings, horns, teeth, a tongue, or extra arms and legs?,
Lay your material out in front of you.
Make the necessary cuts for the head.
Make the necessary cuts for the neck.
Make the necessary cuts for the arms, which will usually be a vertical line at the bottom of the sock with the cuts for the neck or a vertical line down the top of the second sock from the middle of the toe to about 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) below the heel.
The cuts for the legs are almost self-explanatory.
Make the cuts for any accessories or other limbs your monster might need.
Turn the body of your monster wrong-side-out to sew on limbs and appendages.
Sew buttons on the monster or glue googly eyes on him so he can see.

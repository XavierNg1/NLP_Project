Analyse your problems; Before sharing your problem with others analyse if your problem is really worth sharing with someone or are you just overreacting to it by seeing it through a magnifying glass.
Rethink about your problem in a calm and serene atmosphere.
Share the problem with someone: If you have not found any solutions, then go to the person (any person close to you) with whom you want to share the problem.
Zero- in expectations :Don't expect too much from your friend.
Expect no favouritism: Don't expect the solution to be in your favour.
Build up your confidence : It is not that you are to face a war or something like that but when you put in confidence in yourself you will be able to picture the problem exactly to others.

,
Don't miss a detail: Say your problem point by point without missing any minute detail.
Be patient: Don't be in a hurry, be patient.

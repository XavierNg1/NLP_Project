Look around and see all the exercise that we could be getting right at home.
While we are working on changing the way that we think, it is important that we all realize the importance of how we eat.
Realize that it is crazy the way that TV portrays things, like someone that wears a size ten, gets down to a size one...like a size ten was too big, Not!,
Now that we are done resetting our minds lets look at simple (good old fashion) home chores to stay fit; such as sweeping the porch, pulling weeds by hand, trimming hedges, wiping down the counter tops in the kitchen, taking down curtains and washing them, feather dusting the walls, dusting and polishing furniture.
Now since you are already working out, why not take time out from chores and hop on an exercise bike to take yourself for a ride; then later while relaxing (in front of the tube) do a few simple curls with a small dumbbell...while being proud of all that you accomplished in a days time.

If you're video-game savvy and enjoy dance games, then why not buy DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) or purchase a Wii and Wii Fit?,
If you are hyper and bored and stuck at home, jump around the house.
Don't forget, if hopping seems strange or boring, add a hula hoop or jump rope!,
Use TV to your advantage by creating exercise games based on your favorite shows.

Cancel your plans.
Buy a football.
Go outside.
Tap into your imagination.
Sing the national anthem.

,
Do the ceremonial coin toss.
Decide who's playing the game.
Toss the ball up in the air, and catch it.
Now you've got to return the kick.
Time to play offense.
Go retrieve the ball.
It's all about visualization.
Go win the game.

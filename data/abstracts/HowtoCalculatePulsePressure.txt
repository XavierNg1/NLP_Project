Take your blood pressure.
Take note of the diastolic number and the systolic number.
Subtract your diastolic number from your systolic number to get your pulse pressure.
Determine if your pulse pressure is at a safe range.
Call a doctor if your pulse pressure is over 60 mmHg.
Contact your physician if your pulse pressure is lower than 40 mmHg.

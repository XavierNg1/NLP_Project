Plan your project.
Select your stones from a stone supply yard.
Lay out the wall area and direction.
Dig a ditch the length of the wall that is about a foot wide and 8 to 12 inches (20.5 cm - 30.5 cm) below the ground level.
Stack the larger rocks in the ditch.
Fill dirt behind the large rocks and tap the earth firmly, while letting the 8 degree slant hold the rock in place by gravity.
Find complementary rocks to fill in the spaces in between the large rocks.
Continue placing the second layer of rocks, so that spaces between the first layer of large rocks are filled.
Square off the top of the wall with smaller stones to give it a neat, straight and flat appearance.

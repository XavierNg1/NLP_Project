Ensure that your computer has the appropriate support capacity to accept the card: PCI Slot Adaptable.
Obtain a planar mirror-flip card.
When the card arrives, install it in the empty slot (no software is needed).
After closing the back of your system, connect a six-inch DVI-D adapter or HDMI cable (whichever your system supports).
Check to see if it works.

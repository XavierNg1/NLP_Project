Wait until your kitten is enthusiastic and curious about the outdoors.
Create sections of the day where he gets to go outside and slowly get more used to it.
Once he is familiar with the backyard let him go outside by himself.
Try to protect them from the road and traffic.
If you live on a less busy road, skip leashing him.

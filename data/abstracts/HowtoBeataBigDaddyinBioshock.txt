Check to make sure you are all set to take on a Big Daddy.
Know your environment.
Battle with the tactics you can afford.
If you have explosive shotgun shells, use 'em.
If you have electric shotgun shells, alternate between using the electric shells and other weapons.
If you have some Proximity Mines and the Telekinesis plasmid, you can take out the monster in one shot.
If you (like most conservative players) almost never use your RPGs (Rocket propelled grenades) or fragmentation grenades, then here's where your saving can pay off.
If you have the 'Hypnotize Big Daddy' plasmids, you can pull off an entertaining end to multiple Big Daddies.
If you have finally gotten the crossbow, you can set up a trap for Big Daddies.
Scavenge what you can.

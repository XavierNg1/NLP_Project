Hire an entertainer, if possible.
If you are still not able to hire an entertainer, get someone to help you with the children.
Decide a theme for your party.
If you want to keep the kids attention with games at your party you should give out prizes.
Arrange games.
Paint faces.
Teach yourself how to do some basic balloons for the children.
Try some arts and crafts.
Again, it is best to hire an entertainer with liability insurance.
The most important thing is that you, your child and your guests enjoy the day.

Mark the back of the wrench at the center of the drive of the wrench.
Measure from that mark to where you would position your hand while using the tool and make a second mark (or a line).
Secure the square head in a bench vise, making sure no other part of the wrench touches the vise.
Align the torque value to the setting of the distance you got in step 2 x 20 pounds (9.07 kilograms).

,
Dangle a 20 pound (9.07 kilogram) weight from marks you drew in steps 1 and 2.

,
If a click from the tool is heard, lift the weight and slowly move it toward the wrench head until the clicking stops.
Measure the distance between the square head and the click mark you just made.
Use the formula Ta=Ts x(D1/D2).
Check your math several times and adjust your wrench accordingly.

,
Note that the distance that matters is the distance from the center of the drive head to the place you hang the weight.

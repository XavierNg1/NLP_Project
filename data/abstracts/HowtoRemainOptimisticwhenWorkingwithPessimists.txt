Be a positive force in the workplace.
Smile.
Be polite but don't take no for an answer.
Ignore the moody blues and constant prophesies of doom.
Recognize the good the pessimist is achieving.
Realize that some workplaces are more pessimistic by nature than others.
Be aware that your coworker or staff member may be experiencing tough times.
Hang in there as best you can.

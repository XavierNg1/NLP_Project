Sit down, preferably on any cushion.
Keep your spine straight, erect, but not rigid.
Swing slightly to the left and right, then forward and back like a pendulum.
Put your hands in your lap, the first knuckles of the middle fingers resting on top of each other, thumbs touching lightly.

,
Your tongue should just touch the roof of your mouth behind your top incisors.

,
Breathe.
Watch your breath and your posture.
Pay no attention to any outside thoughts that arise.
Repeat daily.

,
Start counting your breath, when ever you inhale until you reach 10, then start again with 1.
Use a small yet powerful mantra like SO-HAM, or HAM-SO depending how you like to start (same thing in the end.)

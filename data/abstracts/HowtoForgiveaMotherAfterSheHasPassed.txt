Write down in detail exactly what it is that you resent about your mother.
Write out in detail how it made you feel when your mother did what you resent.
Read what you have written to a picture of your mother.
Change your footwear.
Recall especially that she lived a generation before you.
Stand or sit where your mother did during the episode or one of the episodes she hurt you and look at yourself as she did.
Visualize yourself as a six year old child walking through a meadow and hearing other young children laughing and playing.
Feel what it is like to realize that your mother was once a young child just as you were, a teenager just as you were, suffered the heartache and the joys of life just as you have.
Write a letter to your mother.

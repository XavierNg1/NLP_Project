Buy an aftermarket wiring harness and a mounting kit for a Honda Civic 1996-1998.
Get a Philips screwdriver.
Begin the installation.
Begin removing the center console and the lower dash of under the steering wheel.
Open the glove box of the car and in the top left corner (which is your left facing the glove box) there will be another Philips screw.
Find the next screw.
Go to the driverâ€™s side.
Remove the center console.
Move on to removing the stock head unit.
Note the wires attached to the head unit at the rear.
Now that the stock head unit is completely removed from the car, you can begin the installation of the new head unit.
Get a hold of the clip that was attached to the back of the head unit.
Notice that the colours of the wires on the wiring harness are the exact same colours that are on the aftermarket head unit.
Once you have finished connecting all the wires together, plug in the antenna plug to the aftermarket head unit and insert the head unit in your mounting kit; it should fit right in.

Reattach your ground turn your car on and test out your head unit.
If everything is working, just install the panels back on.

Money (if you're going out)
Pads/Tampons (if you need them)

If you are packing for a child, your child may want to pack themselves but make sure they have all the necessary items which are:


Clothes for the next day
Underwear (Bring extras in just in case.),
Other things which your child can take are:

Make sure you check your child's bag secretly in case they decide to take lots of toys, like some children may do.

Go to bed early.
Set your clothes out the night before.
Have your hygienic items out and ready the night before.
Have a trusty alarm clock.
Don't spend half of the night reading, watching movies, listening to music, etc.
Make up a morning routine.
If you have to have a bath or shower straight after you've woken up (still sleepy) when your alarm clock rings, run to the bathroom, go to the sink/basin and splash cold water on your face, it will wake you up quicker.

If you eat breakfast at home, plan to have something dry the night before as this saves you from having to look through the cabinets in the morning.

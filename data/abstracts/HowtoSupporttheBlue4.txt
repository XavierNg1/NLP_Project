Tell officers that you like them and their use of the motto: (p)ride, (i)ntegrity and (g)uts -- to positively accentuate and overcome the initials that spell a derisive term, "p-i-g".
Have good etiquette when pulled over.
Be polite and appreciative of police officers.
When you see a police officer, go up to them and thank them for helping keep the community safe.

Identify a barter exchange that services your area.
Sign up and start your profile.
Discuss with your trade adviser your profile.
Negotiate a line of credit so you can start bartering immediately.
Ask that your business be profiled in the exchange social media and web page.
If your exchange has a social media strategy (you should only sign up with one that has one), get involved.
Through the exchange electronic platform, contact other traders that belong to your exchange and offer your services to them.

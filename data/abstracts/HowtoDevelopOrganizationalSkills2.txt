Identify what you want to achieve through organization.
Start developing organizational skills with small, practical steps.The task of developing organizational skills can take time.
Work on the most pressing assignments first.Give each assignments or project a separate folder and order them by due date or importance.
Discard clutter.You probably have a lot of stuff in your cubicle or workspace that has nothing to do with your work.
Use the one-touch rule.The one-touch rule demands that you either discard, file, or act on a given memo or document (by, for instance, replying to it) immediately.
Put old documents youâ€™ll need to consult again in folders.Label each folder clearly according to its contents.
Find an appropriate storage space for necessary documents.Once you have filed your old documents, find a way to store them.
Make checklists.Each day, draft a list of everything you need to do that day.

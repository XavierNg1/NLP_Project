First off, learn how to zoom.
Figure out what look speed is good for you.
When looking around while zoomed in, be very careful not to accidentally click the thumb pad.
Try to look around with smooth, sweeping gestures.
Only aim for the head once you have some serious skills or if the target is unaware and is not moving aim for the body and shoot twice.

,
If the target is moving, put the reticle in their path and fire when they walk into it.

,
If a target is jumping, don't bother trying to hit them while they are in the air; wait until they hit the ground between jumps because they will land in a predictable spot, and it takes a bit before they can do the second jump.

,
If possible, shoot for fusion cores near the target.
If the target is in a ghost, don't try to hit them, aim for the gas tank.
If you are being sniped at while attempting to snipe them, move your body rather than your right stick.
If you are close range sniping, keep your reticule at head level, so when you fire you are more likely to hit them in the head.

,
Remember to reload anytime you aren't sniping.
If you are being shot at while trying to snipe, don't bother.
When looking for targets, think of where other people are likely to be headed.
Likewise, try not to be too obvious in choosing where you will snipe from.
Try to blend in.
Don't waste shots.
Use cover.
Have a good secondary weapon in case someone finds you.
If possible, get a teammate to watch your back.
Try to move around when sniping.
If an enemy is coming towards you from a distance, and jumps to avoid being shot, aim at his body and when his head enters the crosshair, shoot.

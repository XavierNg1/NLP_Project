Accept your lack of confidence.
Aim to boost your levels of confidence to aid your dating prowess.
Give yourself confidence by faking it to begin with.
Avoid bashful innuendos and mutterings.
Get this person alone.
Concentrate on one specific goal.
Break the touch barrier.
Take it slowly but not too slowly.
Before you ask them, give them reasons to consider dating you.
Think it through before asking this person out.
Be ready for rejection as much as acceptance.

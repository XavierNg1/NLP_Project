Figure out why you don't want to go to church.
Think about your past record.
Be prepared for resistance.
Explain to your parents how important another activity is to you if there's something specific you want to do instead.
Try to find some other religious activities you could do, such as a youth group, if you don't want to go to church at all.
Seek their compassion.
Confront your parents if your own beliefs vary with their church's beliefs.
This may not work, but if you are desperate enough, then say to your parents something like this "Do you want your children to be happy?"

Gather all your tools and towels and other items.
Remove the grimy old wheels.
After you have the wheels off, you'll need to get to the bearings.
Once all of the bearings are out, fill a dish with olive, sunflower, or canola oil and drop them in to soak for a little while.
Now that the bearings are lubed up, clean all the dirt and sand off them.
Start the reassembly.
Before you screw the wheels back on, if you have washers to put on the outside and inside, do that now.
So your skateboard is all back together.
Make sure you check your hardware screws too.
Ride off into the sunset!

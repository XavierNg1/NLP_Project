If you know how to read music, grab the sheet music.
Listen to the song.
Count the beat slowly in 4/4 time.
Play G-G-C, holding the C. The song starts with one beat's worth of pick up notes: a dotted eighth note G and a sixteenth note G. These are followed by a dotted quarter note C above them held for three beats.
Play G-C-E, holding the E. On the fourth beat of the first measure, the same rhythmic pattern as before repeats, but with different notes.
Play G-C-E three times, holding the last E. Next, the G-C-E pattern from above repeats several times, but with different rhythms.
Play C-E-G (ascending), then E-C-G (descending), holding the last G. On the fourth beat of the fourth measure, the song's short climax begins.
Play G-G-C, holding the C. To end the song, play the pattern you used at the very beginning.
Hold the long notes with fermatas over them.
Grow in intensity through the song, peaking at the high G note.
Let the final note slowly "die".
Play "loose" with the rhythms for emotional effect.

Have at least one stitch done on your right needle.
If the first stitch and the next stitch are both knits, wrap the yarn under and over the needle.
If the first stitch was a knit, and the next stitch is a purl, wrap the yarn around the needle, from back to front.
If the first stitch was a purl, and the next stitch is a knit, bring the yarn towards the front.
If the previous stitch and the next stitch are both purls, wrap the yarn, over the needle from front to back.
Finish the next stitch.
Finish the row, as the pattern directs.

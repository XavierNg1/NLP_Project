If you know them well enough, ask your friend what they think of your object of interest.

If you've already met, it shouldn't be inappropriate to be Facebook or Instagram friends.

Start chatting to him, duh!,

]Get him alone to show (ever so subtly) you're interested in him as more than a friend.
Ask him out, online or by text.

Be prepared for rejection.

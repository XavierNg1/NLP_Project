Understand how to graph common equation types.
Find any zeros first.
Find and mark any horizontal asymptotes, or places where it is impossible for the function to go, with a dotted line.
Plug in and graph several points.
Map the end behavior of the function to see what happens when it is really huge.
Connect the dots, avoiding asymptotic and following the end behavior to graph an estimate of the function.

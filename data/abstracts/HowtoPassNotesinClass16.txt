You will need a small pencil sharpener that you can keep in your pencil case.
Write your note.
Toss the sharpener to your friend or walk over and hand it to them.
Your friend can write a response, put it in the pencil sharpener and hand your sharpener back to you, pretending to return it.

This is a good method because there's no need to be sneaky.

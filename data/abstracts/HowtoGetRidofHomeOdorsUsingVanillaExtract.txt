Find an oven-safe pan or dish.
Re-arrange the oven racks so that you can place the pan or cup of vanilla on the middle rack.
Pour two capfuls or two tablespoons of vanilla into the pan or cup.
Bake the vanilla in the oven for up to 20 minutes or until the odor has left the building.
Consider reinforcing the vanilla smell if your home smells particularly funky.

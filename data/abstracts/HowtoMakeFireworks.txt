Punch a hole near the bottom of an empty can.
Insert a 4-inch fuse into the hole at the bottom of the can.
Put in black or smokeless powder.
Cover the hole with a disc-shaped piece of tissue paper.
Gently fill 1/2 to 2/3 of the can with flammable powder.
Light the fuse, and run back 30–50 feet (9.1–15.2 m).

Be totally relaxed.
Rest your elbows at your sides to take the weight of your arms.
Slowly pull your hands apart about 10 centimetres or 2 inches, then slowly push them back together again, but do not let your finger tips touch.
Keep moving your hands slowly in and out, concentrating on feeling an imaginary "balloon" between your hands until you feel the resistance.

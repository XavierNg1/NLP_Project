Identify triggers for your baby's eczema.
Observe your baby's diet for possible food allergies.Although the relationship between dietary triggers and eczema is controversial, there is suspicion that food allergies and sensitivities may be triggers for eczema flare-ups for some babies.
Give your baby a short lukewarm bath.It is best to use lukewarm rather than hot water, as hot water can contribute to drying the skin, which worsens eczema.
Apply moisturizing cream.
Dress your baby in loose clothing.Tight clothing can be irritating, so allowing the skin to breathe better with loose clothing is a good idea.
Try a humidifier.Because eczema is exacerbated with dry skin, using a humidifier to add moisture to the air can reduce your baby's eczema flare-ups.
Cut your baby's nails short to reduce scratching.Eczema is an itchy rash, and scratching it only makes it worse.
Check with your doctor to confirm your baby's diagnosis.While eczema is extremely common, you will want to see a doctor or pediatrician to ensure that this is in fact your baby's diagnosis, and to rule out that nothing more severe is going on.

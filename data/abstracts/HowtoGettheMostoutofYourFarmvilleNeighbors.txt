Crop and Plot Fertilization.
If you go this route, though, you'll miss out on the opportunity to have your entire farm fertilized when you come back.
Gifts: Because the game no longer directs you to the free gift page every day when you log into FarmVille for the first time, it's easy to forget to send these special items to your friends.
Bonuses: Every time your neighbors earn a ribbon, you'll have the opportunity to receive a bonus from them.
It's never a bad thing to have some extra coins lying around â€“ you can even use them to buy some extra items to earn experience points and level up more quickly.

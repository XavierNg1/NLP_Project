If you're always hungry after you exercise, and therefore eat more: This most likely has more to do with your choice of diet rather than your actual workout.
If you've started a workout regime but gained weight: There are two reasons that may be causing this;


When you first start regular exercise it's likely that your body is building up muscle more quickly than it's burning fat.
If you have a friend who's thinner than you, but who always seems to be snacking: Metabolism, height and age all play a role in this, but remember that snacking can actually be good if you do it right.
If you've been exercising lots, lost weight, but still can't get rid of your cellulite: Less fat does not equal less cellulite.
If your exercise routine is boring you and making you loose motivation:


Try adding a new class such as Zumba or Pilates to your routine to add variety.
If you don't like going to the gym but still want to work out: Workout DVDs will give you the same results as going to the gym, but only if you stick to it and really push yourself.
If you've managed to lose weight, but still aren't happy with your stomach: Make sure you're not overdoing your workout as this can cause your body to panic and cling onto a bit too much fat.

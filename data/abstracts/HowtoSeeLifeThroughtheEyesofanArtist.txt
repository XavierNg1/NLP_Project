Observe someone who's interested in art and point out unique things in the room or setting.
Try drawing what you see when you look at an irregular or odd object.
When looking at an everyday object, memorize it in a familiar way then try looking at the space around the object or looking at it in a different way that someone else might see it.

Artists see life in a different way.
Play that game with yourself where you say the first thing that comes to your mind.
Don't be afraid of weirdness.
Try new things.
Don't think of things as having only one solution.
If you see something cool, draw it.
Imagine you are someone, or better yet something, for an entire day.

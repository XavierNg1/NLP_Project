Know that oil is found in sedimentary rock formations.
Use regional geology as a guide to where oil might be found.
Know where oil reserves are most frequently discovered.
Consider drilling in or near areas with proven reserves.
Look for seeps or leaks.
Map and study the structures you are considering.
Conduct a magnetic survey.
Use seismic data to map the density, thickness, and position of the rock.
Evaluate core samples at promising sites.
Use the data you have collected to create a 3D visualization of the potential reservoir.
Have your landman or negotiator obtain a production sharing contract (PSA) through the government (for non-US oil rights) or a lease with the private landowner or Federal or State offshore block (for US oil rights).
Drill an exploratory well.
Analyze rock samples as you drill.
Test the wellâ€™s productivity.
Decide whether it will be profitable to set up a producing well.

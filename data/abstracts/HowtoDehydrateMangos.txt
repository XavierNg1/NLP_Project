Purchase between 2 and 40 mangoes for your dehydrating procedure.
Set them on the kitchen counter to ripen if they arenâ€™t ripe already.
Buy a mango slicer from an online distributor or a kitchen store if you are planning on dehydrating a large number of mangos.
Slice a mango by placing it on a cutting board with the end down.
Repeat, cutting two cheeks for each mango and setting the slices aside in a bowl.

,
Remove your dehydrating trays from your dehydrator.
Arrange the slices in parallel lines on your dehydrating tray.
Set your dehydrator to 130 to 135 degrees Fahrenheit (54 Celsius) for 10 to 14 hours.
Opt to do them in the oven by stacking them on a parchment lined baking tray and placing them on the lowest setting.
Peel the dried mango off the trays.
Finished.

Start with straight, dry, tangle-free hair.
Apply a styling mousse if you have very straight hair, or if your hair can't hold a curl.
Pull half of your hair up into a bun.
Divide your hair into at least six, equal sections.
Braid the sections tightly.
Spray each braid generously with a heat protection spray.
Run a flat iron over each braid.
Do not undo the braids just yet.
Undo your bun and let your hair down.
Repeat the sectioning, braiding, and straightening.
Let your hair cool before you take the braids out.
Do not brush your hair.
Consider spraying your hair with some hairspray.

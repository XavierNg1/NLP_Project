Don’t avoid removing a bandage by not using one.
Prepare wounds properly for bandaging.
Consider moistening the wound to inhibit sticking.
Cover the wound with a bandage.Choose a bandage that is large enough so that the pad (the part that isn’t sticky) covers the entire wound with a little room to spare.
Get out your razor, if necessary.
Have faith in medical science.

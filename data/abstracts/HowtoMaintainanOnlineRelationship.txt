Try to talk every day for at least an hour or longer.
Avoid distraction.
Use programs that enable you to talk to them, such as the voice conversation feature of MSN or Skype or Facebook.
Enforce the sense of closeness by asking him to play music for you over Voice Conversation, or using Voice Clips.
To keep the spice in the relationship, send each other random playful emails at unusual or unexpected times of the day.Remember important events, such as a test they've been stressing about, and email them a good luck card (plenty of websites allow you to do so for free)

,
Play games together online.
Consider making a joint email account if you don't want anyone else to accidentally read an email your significant other sends you or vice versa.
Play the Anywhere Anytime Anyhow game, which works great if you both have Blackberries (which allow instant email updates) where one person emails the other person a task and no matter what the person's doing, they have to complete the task (make the tasks fun!),
Be romantic and send the other person random gifts, which can work even if the couple lives in different countries by checking out websites that delivers flowers/teddies in their country and placing an order online.

,
Use MSN to your advantage or Facebook.
Be involved in the other person's life.
Having a fight online is probably one of the worst things because its so easy to cut someone out if Internet is the only connection between you two.
Limit joking/sarcasm to phone conversations.
Try each time you guys talk to make it interesting, don't make it to look like a boring chat, or she/he will lose interest in you!

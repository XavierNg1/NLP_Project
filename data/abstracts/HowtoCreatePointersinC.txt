Decide the type of the pointer (that is, the type of data the pointer will be pointing to).
Declare the pointer using a syntax like this: data-type * pointer-identifier; where



data-type is the type you decided in step 1

pointer-identifier is the identifier or name of the pointer variable

,
Assign the pointer to an initial memory location.
Whenever you need to extract the data item currently pointed to by the pointer, use the value-at-address operator (*): int x = *i; where i is an integer pointer.

,
Use the indexing operator on the pointer as if it was an array whenever you want to get a memory location next to the pointer without actually advancing the pointer.
Use the increment(++), decrement(--), += and -= operators whenever you need to change the current location.
After you finish using the pointer, if you allocated memory to that pointer, make sure you free the allocated memory using the free() function.

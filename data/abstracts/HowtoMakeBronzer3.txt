Fill a glass bottle with clear, liquid coconut oil.
Add some essential oils if you want a nice fragrance.
Mix the cocoa powder, ground nutmeg, and ground cinnamon in a separate bowl.
Once you are happy with the combination, add the powders to the bottle.
Close the bottle, and shake it to mix everything together.
Use the oil.

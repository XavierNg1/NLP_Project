Determine your layover time and subtract from that one hour for security screening and returning to your gate, and another hour for round-trip travel.
If you have friends in Puerto Rico who live reasonably close to the airport, your best bet is to call them and ask them to give you a small tour to see places that interest you.
If you like nature hikes, your layover is eight hours or more, and the weather is reasonable, find a tour to El Yunque, the only tropical rain forest in the United States and a Federal Forest Reserve.A visit to El Yunque is an experience you will not soon forget, but dress light, put on some sneakers (do not wear dress or heeled shoes, or flimsy floppy shoes), wear some sort of light hat and sunblock and do not bring a heavy handbag or purse.
If you like to gamble, the airport has a casino in the hotel located in the main terminal!

If you have three or more hours available during the layover and would like to see the Spanish colonial influence on the island, take a taxi ride to Old San Juan's "Plaza de Armas"(pronounced "PLA-za de AR-mas").
Walking in Old San Juan can be a very pleasant, relaxing experience.
If you want to hit the beach and soak up some rays, ask the taxicab to take you to the closest one, the Balneario de Isla Verde (pronounced "bal-neh-AH-rio de IS-lah VER-deh").
If you want to get something to eat, check out Frommer's list of San Juan restaurants.If you want to try some classic Cuban food, the closest to the airport and very much a favorite for locals is Metropol (pronounced "meh-tro-POLL").
If you like art, there are many options in San Juan.
Would you prefer some retail therapy instead?

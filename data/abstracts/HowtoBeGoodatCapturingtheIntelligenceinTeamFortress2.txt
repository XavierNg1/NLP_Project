Plan which kind of intelligence runner you want to be.
Don't go alone!,
Anticipate possible problems.
Look for shortcuts.
Make sure you aren't being followed.
Remember to check for enemies behind you very often, even if you are sure there isn't anybody following you.
Don't immediately grab the intelligence, unless you are a slow moving class like the Demoman.
After grabbing the intelligence, immediately take the shortest way possible to the exit.

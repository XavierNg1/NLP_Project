Start with the simplest element â€“ a straight line.
Click on the Line icon on the Drawing toolbar and place the mouse pointer at the point where you want to start the line (see Figure 3).
Hold down the Shift key while you draw a line to restrict the angle of the line to a multiple of 45 degrees (0, 45, 90, 135 and so on).

,
Keep the Ctrl key pressed while drawing a line to have the end of the line snap to the nearest grid point.
Hold down the Alt key while drawing a line results in the line extending outwards symmetrically from the start point (the line will extend out equally each side of the starting point).
While you are working with this line, look at the information field on the status bar.

Gather all the participants in the game.
Set up the game.
Decide who's going to be pouring the alcohol and refilling the empty glasses.
There is an option of having a sober person nearby.
Have someone to keep track of how many shots each person has drank.
Choose the beginner.
Have that person to make his or her statement.
If no one drinks a glass, meaning they've never done it, then the person who made the statement has to drink a glass themselves.
Whoever is the most sober by the end of it wins.

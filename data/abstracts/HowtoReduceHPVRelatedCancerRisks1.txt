Consider your number of sexual partners.One of the biggest risk factors for HPV related cancers is your number of sexual partners and, in particular, high risk sexual partners.
Practice safe sex.Since sexual intercourse (and skin-to-skin contact of the genitals) is the way in which HPV is passed from one person to another, safe sexual practices is key as a way to reduce your risk of developing HPV related cancer.
Quit smoking.Smoking is a risk factor for many cancers, including HPV related cancers.
Note that oral contraceptive use can put you at higher risk.Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) have been linked to a higher risk for developing HPV related cancer.
Treat any other sexually transmitted infections.If you have any other STIs, such as chlamydia or gonorrhoea, your risk of becoming infected with HPV goes up.
Be aware of other risk factors for HPV related cancers.For reasons that are incompletely understood by the medical community, the more full-term pregnancies you have, the higher your risk of cervical cancer.
Optimize your overall health.Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet high in fruits and vegetables, and decreasing overall stress have all been correlated to better health and to a reduced risk of developing cancer, including HPV related cancers.

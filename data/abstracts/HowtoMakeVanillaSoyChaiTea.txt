Get your tea.
Place six heaping teaspoons or six teabags of the chai tea blend into an eight-cup teapot.

,
Pour six cups of water into a tea kettle or saucepan and bring to the boil.
Once the kettle whistles to signify the water is boiling, gently pour the water over the tea in the teapot.

Allow the tea to steep.
Once the vanilla soy milk has warmed sufficiently, add that to the teapot as well.
Prepare the teacups.
As the aroma fills the room, sit back in an armchair with a nice quilt.

The first thing you should do is to wash your hair.
The first hairstyle I would suggest would be to do a messy bun.
Let's have some fun with the ends of our hair!,
Half up-dos are my favorite hairstyles!,
Go with the popular styles with a unique twist!,
Having your hair down with a cute headband is important to have once in a while!,
Only dye you hair if you are 110% sure you won't regret it.
Have you ever heard the saying, 'Less is more' or 'Natural is best'?

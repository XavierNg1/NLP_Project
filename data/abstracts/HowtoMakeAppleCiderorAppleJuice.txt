Wash your apples.
Select a mix of sweet, ripe, and crisp articles for the best cider.
Cut and core your apples while you set a large pot of water to boil.
Cook your apples in boiling water until the apples are cooked through.
Transfer your apples in batches to a food processor or blender and pulse until smooth.
Strain the liquid from the pulp.
Save the rest of the pulp in order to make applesauce.
On low heat, heat the separated liquid in a pot, add the lime, and mix in spices as desired.
Serve the cider hot, chill it and serve cold, or can it and store for later.

Be aware of your parents' knowledge of conventions.
Be mature.
Explain why you want to go so badly.
Explain that conventions aren't for "weird" kids.
Introduce your parents to a friend who also likes anime.
Work for it.
Try going only if you're 13 or older.
Try going with a group.
If all else fails, just wait until you're older.
However, if you are able to convince them... Congratulations!

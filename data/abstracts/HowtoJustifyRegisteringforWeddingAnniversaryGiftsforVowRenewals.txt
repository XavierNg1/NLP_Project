When a couple has reached the decision to have a vow renewal ceremony to commemorate a 25th or 50th anniversary, there are many things one can do to throw a simple or elaborate party.
Certainly if a couple would rather not receive gifts that's ok, if they would rather share their gifts of commemoration with donations being given to a favorite charity in lieu of gifts that's fine and very commendable, but in no means must they be told they should not accept what friends and family would like to choose to do for them by insinuating its wrong, rude or wrong etiquette.

Registering for gifts is not wrong for any occasion including wedding anniversaries.
The bottom line is that registering for an anniversary is OK, and the celebrating couple should do it.

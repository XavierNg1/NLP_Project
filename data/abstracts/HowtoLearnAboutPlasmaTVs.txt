Realize that plasma TVs are not that expensive.
Know that most plasmas don't necessarily have the most pixels.
Don't just buy a plasma or other flat panel TV to "save space.",
Be aware that pretty much ALL HDTV's are "horizontal rectangles" otherwise known as widescreen and have an aspect ratio of 16x9 as opposed to traditional 4x3.
Burn-in is not really an issue with plasmas anymore.
Plasmas are not obsolete.

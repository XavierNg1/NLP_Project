Write a diary.
If you get wet, run away.
Change something about yourself.
Be mysterious, but not too distant.
Get the look.
Drop hints.
Get freaky around the full moon.
If your friend brings up "Sea creatures" or "Mermaids", reluctantly change the subject, as if you really wish you could say something because you're an expert.

Don't expect that she still likes you, no matter what.
Try to stay friends with her, even though this may be awkward.
Support her in her decisions and hard times, more than you did as just as a friend but maybe just a little less than you did when you went out.
Ask to talk to her alone.
Do something while you talk.
Establish basic things, and move to the finish.
Think before you start talking.
Remember that if you start going out again, make sure you try to avoid ending up in the situation you did last time.

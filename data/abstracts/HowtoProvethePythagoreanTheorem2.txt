Draw a trapezoid with base a+b and sides a and b.
Divide the trapezoid into three right triangles, two of which are congruent.
Calculate the area of the trapezoid using the area formula.
Find the area by summing the areas of the three triangles.
Set the different area calculations equal to each other.

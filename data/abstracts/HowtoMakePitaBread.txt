Buy a grill pan: these come in a variety of sizes and shapes.
Put yeast in 1/4 cup of warm water; add sugar and let stand for 10 minutes.
Form a well in the center; pour in yeast mixture and remaining warm water.
Put the mixture into a slightly oiled bowl and pour a teaspoon or so of oil onto the dough.
Knead for a few minutes then divide into balls about 2 1⁄2 inches (6.4 cm) in diameter.

Roll balls into circles on a lightly floured surface with floured rolling pin, or flatten into circles with hand.
Turn your grill on high and put some cooking spray on it.
Cook for about a minute or two.
Place the pita on a tray or plate and sprinkle with some chili powder or if you're looking for dessert, then some sugar and cinnamon.
Finished.

First start with researching which types of vodka you may like.
Make a list of the vodka types you may like and visit your local alcohol retailer.
Next, retrieve your vodka and glass from the freezer.
Have light pass through the glass to view the texture of the drink.
Take a sip and allow the liquid to sit on your tongue, letting the flavor sink in.
Snack on some food to complement the taste and cleanse your palate.

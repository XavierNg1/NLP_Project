There are two types of bullies who are dangerous.
Learn to recognize an openly aggressive bully.
Avoid the taunting and touching bully by walking with your head and eyes up.
Focus on where you're going, when around a taunting and touching bully.
If you've followed the step above and find yourself being approached by the taunting and touching bully a second time, tell him/her loudly not to "make you hurt them".
If he/she takes you up on your offer, make as big a scene as you can: Raise your voice as loud as you can, throw books or items you are carrying to the floor with as much force as you can and begin yelling promises to damage him/her permanently if they do not leave you alone.

,
Bait the bully for as long as you can before actually coming to blows to give adults time to arrive and secure him or her.
Learn to recognize a manipulative bully.
Understand how manipulative bullies operate.
To avoid the bully who enlists adults to bully others on their behalf, you must take care to treat all fellow students respectfully; voice your complaints about a manipulative bully's behaviour to a wide range of adults (not just your parents); and observe which adults he or she has attempted to enlist against you and seek out adults who have greater authority.

,
If the bully make false accusations against you to a teacher, go to a teacher who has greater seniority and tell them what is happening.
Establish the facts with a few other teachers and/or school administrators so that if the teachers who believe the bully should begin to treat you differently, you can immediately turn to those with whom you've confided your concerns and enlist their help as you fight back.

,
Get your parents involved early on and have them document your complaints against the manipulative bully and the teachers who appear to believe the bully's stories.

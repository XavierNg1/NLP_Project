Import or go to the Autocad drawing that is not to scale.
Identify one line segment in the drawing that you know the length of.
Measure the length of the line segment that you chose in Step 2.
Divide the length the line should be by the length the line is in the drawing.
Type "scale" into the command prompt followed by the space bar.
Check the line that you measured in step 2 to make sure the scale is now accurate.

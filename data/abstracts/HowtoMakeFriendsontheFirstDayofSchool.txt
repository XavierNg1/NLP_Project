Make a good first impression.
Dress in a non-threatening way that is still you.
Smile!,
Chances are, you and a lot of other new people will be in a place all at once (canteen, field, playground).
Try to forge good relationships with people in your classes, as these are the people you are forced to be around.
If someone is giving off friendly vibes, compliment their look, clothes or bag.
Get involved in things.
Be yourself.
Be different and unique, but don't deliberately try to stand out from everyone else so much that everyone can see you're trying too hard.

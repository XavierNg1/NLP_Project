Effectively use flash grenades.
Effectively use smoke grenades.
When you get flashed multiple times, it's an obvious rush, immediately pull out your nade and counter the flash... usually it'll land right in the middle of them.

,
An experienced user can pitch a nade around a corner without even peeking it.
Predict the opponent.
Change up your style.
When reloading and in a gunfight struggle, just pick up another gun asap.
Remember to closely pay attention to your spray, with AK you want a 2 shot burst, with the mp5 you just want to tap on their head 1 shot at a time at a distance, if it's close just spray at Headshot level...

,
Sometimes if you miss with the AK, a sporadic spray can still get the target, lower your aim to make up for the recoil, try lowering it at an angle towards the direction the enemy is running.

,
When playing at long distances against awpers, make very small strafing motions back and forth.
Don't always jump around corners, it makes you an easy shot for an awper.

,
Sometimes come out of a corner halfway, not even enough to peek it, the awper will see your arm and try to shoot, then you can pop out on his recoil.

,
Look for less obvious cover.
Plant the bomb in open areas so your team-mates can cover it.
Save some flashes/nades to hold off the counter-terrorists.

,
Learn the timing of every rush point..
Talent.

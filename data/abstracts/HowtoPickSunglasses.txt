Aim to protect your eyes first and foremost.
If you want your sunglasses to protect you from these risks, look for pairs that block at least 99% of UVB rays and at least 95% of UVA rays.
Don't buy sunglasses if they're labeled as "cosmetic" or don't provide any information on UV protection.
Select a size.
Use the shape of your face to help you pick your sunglasses shape.
Make sure the sunglasses fit properly.
Note that the color of the lenses doesn't just affect your fashion statement, it affects how well you detect contrast and differentiate colors.
Check for distortion.
Choose scratch-resistant lenses.

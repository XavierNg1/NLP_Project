Consider installing fencing to deter your puppyâ€™s digging.
Gather the supplies you will need.
Lay the fence foundation.
Lay large rocks on top of the chicken wire.These rocks will weigh the chicken wire down so that your puppy will not be able to dig it up easily.
Install the chain link fence.Make sure that the bottom of the chain link fence is buried one or two feet below the surface.
Lay more chicken wire on the ground.Roll out more chicken wire on the ground along the fence line; you anchor it to the bottom of the chain link fence.

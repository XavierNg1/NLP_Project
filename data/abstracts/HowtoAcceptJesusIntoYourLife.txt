Trust Jesus Christ today!,
Admit that you are a sinner and that you need God's help.
Be willing to change your mind and turn from your sin (repent).
Believe that Jesus Christ died for you, was buried, and rose from the dead.
Through prayer, invite Jesus into your heart to become your personal Lord and Savior.
Pray:


Dear God, I am a sinner and need your forgiveness.
If you have received Jesus Christ as your Savior, as a Christian you should:

,
Read your Bible every day to get to know Christ better.
Talk to God in prayer every day.
Be baptized, worship, fellowship, and serve with other Christians in a church where Christ is preached and the Bible is the final authority on everything.
Tell others about Christ.
Learn about Jesus and believe that He died, rose from the dead as your Savior and then pray of repentance to the one, true God.
Walk in love; telling others that "There is one mediator for us, The Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who is Lord and Savior for everyone who believes, repents and follows him -- and so, (walk in the Spirit):""Follow Jesus Christ" includes going to Christian meetings with people of like faith and being Baptised.

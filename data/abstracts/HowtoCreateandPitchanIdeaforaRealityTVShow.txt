Identify the category of reality series you want to create.
Create the unique "hook" for your show.
After you've decided on your show's premise and unique hook, you'll be able to create a captivating Title for your reality show that supports the core concept.
If you're creating a "Docu-Style" series idea, you'll want to focus on writing a synopsis including these three things; describing the specific people involved and their relationships, describing the unique world the show takes place in, and describing the potential events that will unfold.

If you're creating a competition format, focus on writing a synopsis of the "arc" of the series that describes how the competition works and progresses over the course of the season.
Once you create and write your Title, Logline, and Synopsis, you should ideally have a very brief but impactful pitch between 1 and 4 pages.

Prior to any exposure in the marketplace (Production Companies, Agents, Networks, or Marketing Services) get proof-of-creation by researching online archival services for your reality TV show pitch.
Research Production Companies that produce similar shows within the same genre as yours.
Use TV Industry Websites that Producers use for scouting new TV show ideas and formats.
When pitching Producers in person, be very direct by immediately communicating the unique agenda of the show.
When a Production Company is interested, they will propose an "Option Agreement" to you, for your project.
Be sure to consult with an Attorney before signing any deal.

Tie one end of a string around the middle of a pencil and tie a paperclip to the other end.
Dip the string in the glass of sugar








You must make sure the string is completely dry before you proceed to the next step and be very careful not to knock off any of the seed crystals when you place the string in the solution.You can skip this step or try to speed it along by wetting the string and rolling it in granulated sugar (just make sure the string is completely dry before you put it in the glass and the sugar isn't falling off), but making seed crystals will make your rock candy grow faster and increase your chances of success in growing crystals.
Lower the string into the glass of sugar/water solution, resting the pencil on the top of the glass.
Place the glass somewhere safe, where it will remain undisturbed.
Wait one week for crystals to form.
Carefully remove the string from the solution and lay it on wax paper to dry.

Think about what your best friend is usually like.
Consider what your best friend is capable of.
Let out your anger, sadness or disappointment.
Consider writing down what is bothering you most.
Show your pain.
Talk to your friend openly.
Argue calmly.
If your friend just doesn't get it and won't back off and return to being a good friend, don't be this person's friend anymore.

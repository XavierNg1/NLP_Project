Find the cow or heifer.
Observe what stage of birth she's in.
Restrain the cow, if necessary.
Clean your hands and arms from your shoulders down.
If the calf is in normal position or in a position where you can pull from, put a set of calving chains or a rope (not twine, as twine is often too thin and too sharp to be used on a calf) on the front legs of the calf.
Once the calf is out, you must try to get it breathing right away.
Once the calf has given signs that it is breathing and alive, carry or drag it to a pen with clean straw, then let the new momma cow out to be with her young.

,
Leave the cow and her newborn calf alone for a while to allow the cow to mother-up to the calf, clean the calf off, and urge him to start nursing.

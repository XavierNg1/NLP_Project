Write a book with just about anything.
Maybe you donâ€™t want to investigate.
Brainstorm.
Write about something that you love.
If you start to have an idea of what you would like to write, ask yourself questions!,
Gather your ideas together in your head.
Start writing without having a plan.
Keep writing until you don't feel much like it.
Come back later.

Know where to look, approximately.
If the moon is not visible, (by this if it is below the horizon), but Orion is, the cluster is probably east of Orion.
Make sure all nearby light sources are off.
Look directly at between Orion and the moon.
If you wear glasses for distance vision correction, put them on.

Squint if you have to, but you should eventually be able to see a faint blue light, not a single star, in the sky.Try using a telescope or some binoculars for a better view.
Congrats.

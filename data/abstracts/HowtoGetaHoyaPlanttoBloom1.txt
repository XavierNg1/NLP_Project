Place your Hoya near a window.
Hang sheer curtains if you place your plant in front of a south-facing window.
Give your plant additional sunlight to help it bloom.
Let the potting soil dry out almost all the way before watering a Hoya plant during the spring, summer and fall.
Water Hoyas in the morning.
Dump the excess water out of the saucer beneath the container.
Let the potting mix dry completely before watering your plant in the winter to encourage the Hoya to have a rest period.
Recognize signs that your plant is being watered too much, or has rotted.

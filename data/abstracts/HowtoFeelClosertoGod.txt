If you are unfamiliar with God and don't know Him very well (ie: vaguely by name) then perhaps you should start by just locking yourself in your room.
Take a deep breath and try to clear your mind of all things that trouble you.
Then, as you would speak to a friend or someone you really trust, unloosen your tongue and tell God all that bothers you.
Another great way to feel closer to God is to get to know Him.
We can feel closer to God if we try to do the things He likes.
Don't make promises to God that you can't keep.
Be aware that He can and will talk to you through your day to day life.
Enjoy the walk with your new friend.

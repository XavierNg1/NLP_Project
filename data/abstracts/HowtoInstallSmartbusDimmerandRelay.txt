Know that the S-BUS network can be achieved by 4 wires only:DATA + DATA- GND +24

Those 4 wires can be used from any type of DATA cable, CAT5, CAT6, or any other.
Prepare your tools.
Consider your options.
Understand that S-BUS G4 devices are rail mountable devices, and they are also equipped with two connectors on both sides that enable multiple devices to be cascaded in a train like manner on the rail.
Know that, to achieve the network between the S-BUS devices, you need only 4 wires, two wires for supplying the power to the Device (+24 & GND) and another two wires for data transfer between devices (D+ & D-).
Know that the Dimmer is device that controls light, with the ability to dim any dimmable lights.

,
Understand that light circuits run with two wires always, the line and the neutral, the hot and the cold, the phase and the black.
Realize that Smart BUS G4 Dimmers accept both 220 and 110 AC power input.
Take into consideration what type of dimmer are you using.
Keep this check-list in mind:

Dimmers channels load handling.
Consider an example:

In the picture we have four channels Dimmer, meaning the maximum load that can be connected to each channel is 3 Amps.
Know that, for extra protection, an external fuse is preferred to be connected ahead of each channel to protect against overload, shorts, electrical sharks and other common electrical issues.See that the simple buttons on the surface of the Dimmer will act as manual switch to turn the lights on and off.After the bus is connected, now you can control those channels and dim it using other devices like the DDP or an Apple device using the G4 iOS application.Refer to the programming manual for Dimmer â€“ DDP for more information on how to program it.
Keep in mind the device specific wiring for relays.

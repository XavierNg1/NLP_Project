Fill a medium-sized saucepan halfway with water and bring it to a boil over high heat.
Gently place the eggs into the water.
Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 11 to 13 minutes.
Prepare an ice bath while the eggs are cooking.
Place the cooked eggs into the ice bath, and wait 5 to 15 minutes.
Take the eggs out of the ice bath and set them down someplace where they won't roll away.
Crack the egg, then roll it across a hard surface.
Peel the shell away from the egg.
Dry the eggs off with a paper towel.
Finished.

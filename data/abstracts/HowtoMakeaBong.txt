Find any type of bottle or can (a 2L/16oz bottle works fine).
Punch or heat up a paper clip with a lighter and cut out a 1/8 inch (3mm) to 1/4 inch (6mm) hole about 2 inches (5cm) from the bottom.
Place a tube in the hole at the bottom you've made.
Make sure it's airtight!,
Attach a bowl to the end of the tube.
Fill the bong with water until the tube inside the bottle is completely underwater by at least 1 inch (2.5 centimeters).
Put a carb or 'clearing hole' halfway down the bottle or lower, just make sure it isn't so low that you will spill it whenever you smoke.
Load the bowl with your favorite smoking product, cover your clearing hole up with one finger, light the filled bowl, while sucking in lightly.








,
'Milk' the chamber, then let go of the clearing hole and suck in hard.
Finished.

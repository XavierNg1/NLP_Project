Don’t listen to the experts.
Match the number of slides to the subject matter.Some topics require a few slides and a lot of exposition.
Tailor your slideshow to your audience.If you're presenting highly detailed or technical information to a group of people who are very familiar with the industry terms and metrics that you're presenting, you might include a lot of slides that you move through rather quickly, but which are necessary to provide supporting material and demonstrate that you know what you’re talking about.
Think about the venue you’re presenting in.If you’re presenting in a large venue like an auditorium but you only have a small projection screen for your PowerPoint slides, you should minimize the importance and number of your slides and focus instead on the spoken aspect of your presentation.

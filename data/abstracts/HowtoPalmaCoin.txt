Choose a larger coin if you are just starting out.
Buy palming coins from a magic store.
Place the coin in the base of the dominant hand.
Press the coin into the palm of your hand.
Bring your thumb closer to the forefinger.
Show the audience that your other hand is “empty.” All you have to do is show your other hand is empty, while keeping the concealed coin in your classic palm position.
Practice a lot.

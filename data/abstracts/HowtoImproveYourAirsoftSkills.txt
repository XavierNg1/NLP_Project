Before you enter the battlefield, it's a good idea to get in some training.
Take your gun out to your backyard (not to public property, as the police might not like it) and set up some targets.
Once you're fairly well practiced at killing defenseless plastic, it's time to move up to bigger game.
So, now you're after the ultimate game: man.
Defense Oriented players tend to stay in a general area, either guarding an important location or laying in wait for passing enemies.
It has also been suggested that one could mislead the sniper into believing you don't know he's there, by pointing your weapon in some other direction, all the while secretly watching him.
Offense Oriented players won't wait for you to come to them - they're coming to get you.
Remember, the more you play, the better you will become.

Know how Lord Shiva is called.
Be aware that Lord Shiva is present in each and every element that comprises this universe, and Mahadev is the only God who is present inÂ every human being (that is why they say Har Har Mahadev; it means every one is mahadev, since he is present in every one).
Pray to Mahadev from your Chitta (chitta is termed as the mind-stuff or mental substance).
Chant the panchakshari mantra (five letter mantra) " namah shivaya".If you have an audio or video of the vedic Rudram mantra, play that as well, since it creates a huge positive vibration.
Do 'abhishekham' to Lord Shiva every Monday with water, honey, turmeric powder, sugar, curd etc.

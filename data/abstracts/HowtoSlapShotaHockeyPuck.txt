Start with the puck between your feet while standing straight towards the puck.
Place the puck at about "2 o'clock" to you.
Move your hands right to the top of the stick (the shaft).
Bend your legs as far as you can so your right knee is almost touching the ground.
Begin your swing.
Swing the stick (touching the ground) along the floor until it is almost behind you.
Swing the stick forwards with as much force as possible but make sure you hit the ball clearly.

Write down each formula step please.Subtract c from both sides and obtain ax^2 + bx = -c

,Multiply both sides by 4a to obtain 4a^2x^2 + 4abx = -4ac

,
Complete the square on the left and add b^2 to the right side: (2ax + b)^2 = b^2 - 4ac.Take the square root of both sides to obtain (2ax + b) = ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)

,
Subtract b from both sides, then divide both by 2a to obtain x = (-b ± sqrt(4ac))/2a.

,
Since there are two x roots, depending on the ±, restate as {x1, x2} = (-b ± sqrt(4ac))/2a.

,If you find a shorter version, please let me know.
It's good practice to also work it backwards to the original form, i.e.Open an Excel worksheet and take notes; save the file as something like Quadratic NeuOps into a logical folder.
Note that the Neutral Operation x+b = x*b = c holds the two operators, Addition and Multiplication, neutral with regard to the set {x, b, c | x or b ≠ 1} (else division by 0 results in the denominator, which is either undefined or infinite, where Infinity is not a number.),
Work through the easy few steps again, realizing that both Addition and Multiplication are commutative, so what applies for x, applies equally to b -- there is Symmetry.

Attach the loop of the hand line to your left wrist.
Release all the net, line, everything.
Pick up the hand line and create several 12 to 16 inch (30 to 40 cm) coils by looping it in your left hand.
Take the horn of the net and place it in the left hand, with your left palm facing upward.
Make one more coil in your left hand using the net just beneath the horn.
Split the remaining net in half with your right hand.
Roll the half in your right hand over your left thumb, transferring the entire net to your left hand.
Find the skirt bottom where the lead pile transitions from high to low and place this area in your teeth.
With your right hand, reach down and grab the part of the lead line that swings down from your teeth.
Keeping the lead line in between your pinky and ring finger, grab the half of the net that was resting over your thumb.
Twist your body at the waist, keeping your toes pointing to the front, and unload to throw the cast net.
Watch the net as it fans out clockwise and lays upon the water.

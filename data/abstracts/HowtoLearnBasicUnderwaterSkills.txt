First is opening your eyes underwater.
So the first step is a small science lesson!,
Anyhow, time for Practice!,
When you've become comfortable opening your eyes in the tub, try moving your head.
Keep moving on to new levels.
If you live by the ocean, this will be harder to get used to.
Next is holding your breath!,
For the first lesson, try breathing deeply.
Next, take five seconds to inhale, pause for five seconds, then exhale for five seconds, pause for five seconds, and repeat.
This is the practice that I do daily.

Find the eyes of the coconut.
Poke into the eye with a knife, a drill bit, or a screwdriver.
Drain the water into a bowl, jar or cup.
Locate the thin line along the middle of the coconut.
Smack the coconut against the line with the back side of a large knife or meat cleaver.
Rotate the coconut about a quarter of a turn with each rap.
Pry the meat away from the shell.
Place the 2 coconut halves on a cookie sheet in the oven at 150°C (300°F) for 1-2 hours.
Place the coconuts shell-side down in a well-ventilated area.

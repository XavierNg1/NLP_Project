  Negative Terminal

First (most important step) is the diagnosis.

Disconnect the negative terminal at the battery.

Remove the accessory belt by relieving the tension on the belt.

Now remove black dust boot from the top of the alternator (just wiggle it back off where it is).

Remove the three bolts holding the alternator to the accessory bracket and the electrical connector on the side of the alternator.




Take the vacuum lines off of the fuel pressure regulator, and both of the Intake Manifold Runner Control (IMRC) Valves.

Remove the white clip from the arm of the valve.

The lines for the power steering fluid run right where you need your wrench to go, so be VERY careful not to bend these lines too much, or even break them or you may be making an additional repair!,

Get the white clip for the new valve, and insert it in the hole that the old one came out of.
Put everything back on that you took off!,
Do a second check to make sure that you have everything back together that you took apart, and that all of your tools are out of the engine compartment.

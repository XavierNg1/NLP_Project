Get some bobby pins, and slide them over the top of a sheet of paper.
Paint the top of your bobby pins using a single stroke.
Wait for the nail polish to dry, then add a second coat of nail polish, if needed.
Add a clear top coat to protect your work, if desired.
Wait for the nail polish to dry overnight.Nail polish may feel dry to the touch in under an hour, but it might still be soft underneath.
Carefully take the bobby pins off of the paper.

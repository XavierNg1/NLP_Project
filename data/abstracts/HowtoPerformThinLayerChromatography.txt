Lightly press the tip of the pipette to the intersection of one of the dashed lines and the horizontal line you made previously on the silica side.This will cause the solution in the pipette to be sucked onto the silica, resulting in a small circle of solvent and compound.
Dry the TLC plate.
Develop the plate.
Remove the plate.
Dry the plate.
Visualize the plate.
Calculate the retardation factor (Rf).

Find a male who is in a relationship, to whom you are genuinely attracted to.
Establish some sort of contact with the boy, if at all possible.
Whenever talking to him, keep the conversation light, and let him do almost all the talking.
Thank him for whatever he has done for you, even if it is of no real help.
Continue conversing with him.
When he talks about his girlfriend, remain positive about her.
Whatever quality he mentions he dislikes in her, become the opposite.
Bring out your sexiest outfits.
Find another guy.
Go to the hair-salon, and ask for a natural-looking blowout.
Dump the man you are dating.
Phone the boyfriend you are stealing.
When he comes over, stick to your story and tell the him that you would rather just forget about the other guy and move on with your life.
Do not sleep with him.
Arrange an outing.
If he does share them, let him set the pace with breaking it off with her, but be aware he may be playing you to see how you will react.
Once he has ended his relationship with her, you can really move on together, but remember if he left her, he could leave you.
When things start going better, go even farther with the relationship and see where you end up.

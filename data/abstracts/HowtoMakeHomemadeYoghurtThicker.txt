Use fat free milk to help make your yoghurt thicker.
Add 1/2 cup of milk powder to the milk before you start heating it.
Heat the milk to a higher temperature - 200ºF (95ºC).
Allow the milk to cool sufficiently, then add the yoghurt culture.
Let the yoghurt sit for a minimum of seven hours at a temperature close to 110ºF (45ºC).
Strain the yoghurt for a longer time.
Use the yoghurt from this batch to start the next batch.

Work in the central midfield if you want to dictate both offensive and defensive strategies.
Play defensive midfield if you're calm, composed, and effective under any kind of pressure.
Play offensive midfield if you like quick combinations and long-range shots.
Play outside midfield, or "wing," if you can run for days and days at a high speed.

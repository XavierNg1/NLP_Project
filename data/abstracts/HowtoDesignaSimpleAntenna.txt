Find out what frequency you want (for Wi-Fi you are using 2.45GHz = 2,450,000,000Hz).
Get a good conductor.
Work out the length you need the wire to be.
Cut the wire a little bigger than you need, about 6.5 centimeter (2.6Â in) or so.
Form a "Ground-Plane".
Drill a hole in the center of the plate just big enough for the co-axial cable to fit through.

,
Pare the Co-ax cable to reveal it's ground , which can be pulled back to reveal the inside insulator.

,
Push the cable through so that the start of outer insulation is flush with the hole.
Pare the inside insulation back to reveal the signal conductor.

,
Solder the copper wire to the signal conductor of the co-ax.

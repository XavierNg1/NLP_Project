Pre-planning.
If, for some reason, there is no, "dad" available to help out with planning and advice, One should designate a special male friend or family member.
Talk to him about what he would want/like for the shower.
If it's a surprise shower, definitely get dtb involved in the planning as much as possible.

,
Send out "Couples Baby Shower" invitations!,
Make sure dtb knows all the important information off the top of his head (he will be asked): Date, time and specific location of shower; where the gift registry(s) is/are; etc.

,
Plan your decorating scheme with the guys in mind.
Include man-friendly foods in your menu.
Avoid, "Baby Shower Games.",
If you must have games, don't make the men feel they must participate.

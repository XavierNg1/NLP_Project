Get your cat microchipped at a vet clinic or animal shelter.
Identify your cat using a cat-safe collar at all times.
Check the collar often to be certain the tag is readable and the latches are working.
Keep your cat as an indoor cat.
Take photos of your cat in case it becomes lost.
Use a leash and harness when outdoors.
Always transport your cat in a sturdy carrier when leaving the house to prevent escapes and protect them in the car.
Don't tempt your cat to escape by leaving doors or windows with torn screens open.
Train your cat to come on command, if you can.
Use a cat playpen to give your cat some fresh air and entertainment.
Instruct temporary caregivers to keep the cat inside, watch doors and windows, and show them how to use the carrier in case of an emergency.
Be especially careful during stressful times like holidays, family upheavals, and weather extremes: a cat that is normally relaxed may behave in unusual ways when stressed.

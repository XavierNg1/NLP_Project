The Lutterloh System was invented in 1935 in Germany by Maria Aloisia Lutterloh (her maiden name was Aigenberger at that time).
You need only two measurements (bust and hip) to make your own made to measure clothing patterns.
The most important tool is the special sizing scale which is attached to an ordinary centimeter measure-tape.
These numbers represent the bust and hip measurements in centimeters.

,
The smallest number 50 is about 18 inches (45.7 cm) and the highest number 140 is about 55 inches (139.7 cm).
The scale is then guided around the pattern until it touches one of the lines with a number on it.

After all the dots have been placed they are connected.

Seam allowance needs to be added to the Lutterloh patterns.

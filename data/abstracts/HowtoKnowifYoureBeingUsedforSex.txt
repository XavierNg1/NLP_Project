Think about how your partner usually gets in touch.
Do not text or call first.
Look at what your partner does, not what they say.
Think about the kinds of "dates" you have.
Beware of cheaters.
Reflect on what your partner says they like about you.
Look at the timeline.
Be skeptical of what someone tells you before you have sex.

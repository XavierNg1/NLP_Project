Choose a box.
Secure the bottom of the box with packing tape.
Lay the box on its side.
Mark lines about 1 inch (2.5 cm) inside each edge of the box on each side and on the top.
Using the box cutter, carefully cut along the lines you drew.
Cut the front flaps off with a box cutter.
,
Cut a section of white fabric (white muslin fabric) or White Nylon and white fleece, large enough to fit over each of the openings you cut.
Use the box cutter and scissors to remove any stray pieces of cardboard from the front edge of the box.
,
Cut a piece of matte white poster board to fit the inside of your box.
Insert the poster board into the box, curving it up towards the top of the box.
Cut matte black poster board in sections large enough to cover the tissue paper areas.
Add your lighting.
Take some test shots as you go.
In the end, your images should come out clean, crisp, and without a ton of gray color throughout.
Finished.

The other way to dance is to teleport to an animation store and buy a dance hud that hold your own dances.
Come prepared to spend.
Load a dance hud.
Now that you have your new hud, find a club and a spot on the dance floor.
Some people in Second Life call this sharing of a dance hud a “chin.” If you get asked to share someone’s chin, remember they are asking to animate your avatar.
Don’t forget to release everyone on your hud before you leave, otherwise they will continue dancing!,

If you’re a man, and asking a woman to dance for the first time, please select dances that are appropriate for strangers and not groping dances.

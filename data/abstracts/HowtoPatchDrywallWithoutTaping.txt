Take your measuring tape and measure a square perimeter around the hole of 4"x 4", then draw out the lines around this.
Get a piece of sheetrock that measures the same thickness as your wall sheetrock (Most walls have 1/2 inch sheetrock installed).
Cut the whole 6x6 section from edge to edge.
Carefully break off the rock by bending with your hands.
Check your fit with the 4x4 hole in the wall.
Patch the drywall.
Slide the 4x4 into the 4x4 hole, keeping it even with the wall by not pressing in too far.
Carefully draw out any bubbles around the edges of the excess paper, bringing it tight and flush with the wall.
Apply a small amount of the compound around the edges of the paper, making up the difference of the thickness of the paper to the wall.

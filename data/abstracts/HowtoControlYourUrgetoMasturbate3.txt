Lie down in bed only for sleep.
Keep your bladder as empty as possible.
Go to sleep when you are really tired.
When you sleep, lay on your side.This may help to reduce your urge at the time because you are less likely to become aroused by rubbing up on something.
Get out of bed immediately in the morning.

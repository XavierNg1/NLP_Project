Learn counting ordinals from one to ten in Italian segmented forms (hints are for English speakers' pronunciation).


Note that all the cardinals from eleven upwards end to a vowel (that is, a, e, i, o).


Know that when a cardinal ends to three (3) such as twenty-three, thirty-three, forty-three, and so on, to build ordinals, do not drop the ending vowel of "tre;" hence,

Twenty-thirdÂ : (twenty-three)ventitre+esimo: ventitreesimo (ventitreesimo).


Note that ordinals greater than tenth could have a second construct as an aesthetical variation of style.

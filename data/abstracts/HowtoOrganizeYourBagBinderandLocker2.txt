A good system to go by is get one 2 inch binder for all your subjects.
If the option is available, find out your courses beforehand.
Put a reasonable amount of paper in each one.
If you really feel like being organized, separate your binder into different sections, such as tests, assignments, and notes.
Decorate your binder as you wish.

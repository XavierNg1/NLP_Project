Allow yourself to express emotion through your face.If you're nervous, your face will freeze up.
Stake a claim on your personal area.Whether you're speaking on stage or something more casual, chances are there's a larger physical space you could be occupying.
Scan your eyes across everyone you're speaking to.Eye contact is essential if you want to foster a connection with the audience he's speaking to.
Use gestures in tandem with what you're saying.Body language is a powerful tool on the stage, but it's only worth as much as it relates to the topic you're speaking about.
Keep your movements controlled.Above all, you should keep every noticeable movement of your body under control when you are speaking.

Stretch out the tube to its full length.
If available, get a relatively strong, yet thin piece of wood.
Boil some water on the stove.
After pouring hot water through once or twice, leave the tube on the wood (or rulers) for 5 to 15 minutes, to allow it to cool.
Dry off any excess water from the outer side, then (this is more tricky) the inside.

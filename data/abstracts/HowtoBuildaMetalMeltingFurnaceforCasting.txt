Determine the size of the furnace for your needs.
Choose materials that will withstand the flame temperature of your fuel.
Form two cylinders using available materials.
Attach your outer cylinder to a metal base to help support it.
Fit firebrick into the bottom of the outer cylinder, making them as tight as possible.
Set the inner cylinder inside the outer cylinder with an equal space around it.
Drill or cut a 2 1⁄4 inch (5.7 cm) hole through the outer and inner cylinders just above the top of the firebrick bottom, at an angle off center so the air will swirl around the crucible feeding the burning fuel with oxygen most effectively.

,
Cut a section of 2 inch (5.1 cm) metal pipe (EMT conduit works well) two or more feet long to act as the air feed to the burning chamber and attach it to the outer cylinder with sheet metal screws, or by welding it.

,
Cut another piece of sheet metal large enough to cover the top of the furnace.
Fabricate your crucible (melting pot).
Attach your air blower to the 2 inch (5.1 cm) pipe.
Set a half fire brick or build a support for your crucible so that it will remain stationary during use.
Fill the space between the burning chamber and the crucible with charcoal to within an inch or so of the top of the crucible.
Turn the blower on when the charcoal is ignited sufficiently to sustain fire.
Tend the furnace until your metal is melted, removing ash and trash that accumulates as it melts, then remove the crucible to pour your melted metal into ingot molds or other castings.

Think about your goal.
When you have answered everything, start your work.
If a person says they don't want to be a part of your coven don't pressure them into it further.
When you have gathered your new coven discuss ideas with them.
Don't push anyone too far.
If you are not a secret coven, expect a bit of badmouthing from the locals.
Collaborate some materials.
Create your coven calendar.

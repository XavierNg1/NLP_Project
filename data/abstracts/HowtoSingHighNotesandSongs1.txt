Recognize that all voices have limits.
Identify your own voice type to determine what notes you can likely reach.You can expand your vocal range with practice, but that doesn't mean you can change the natural tone of your voice.
Remember your vocal limits.
Choose appropriate repertoire and keys for your voice's current range.

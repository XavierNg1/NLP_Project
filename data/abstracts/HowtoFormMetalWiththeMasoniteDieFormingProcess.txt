  Masonite die working side is facing downward.

When deciding the measurement for the die, make sure the edge of the plywood is 2" beyond the outside edge of the design to make extra room for the sheet metal to be bolted onto the die and to be strong.Make sure each die for each side has Masonite glued onto the working side(s).
Draw the outline of the design onto a piece of craft paper or thick paper (a paper bag is perfect).Glue the paper design onto the plywood and let dry to follow when you cut out the shape.Drill holes into the plywood on the inside edge of the design for the jigsaw blade, as a starter hole.

Cut the design from the plywood with the jigsaw, saber saw or coping saw (drill a starter hole to insert the blade), making sure to keep the blade straight, vertical, not at an angle with the edge of the plywood, forming the outlined shape straight through, carefully, if you are going to use each half.Place the sheet metal on top of the die.Make sure the sheet metal lines up with the sides of the Masonite faced plywood.Tape the sheet metal to the die with painters, masking tape.
Measure and cut at least four holes all of the way through the plywood, the same size as your four bolts.
Make sure to anneal (soften, remove stress from) the brittle metal with sufficient heat and gradually cooling, if you are using brass, copper or sterling silver.Bolt the metal to the die using the bolts/screws, nuts or tee nuts.

Sink the metal into the die using the hard plastic hammer.
Unbolt the first side and flip the die over and use that side to repeat the sinking process again for a second half (mirror image).Finish by attaching the two mirror halves or by following whatever the design calls for.

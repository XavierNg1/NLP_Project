Understand what a cleansing enema is.
Mix whatever herb or supplement you choose with water, making sure to dilute the solution properly.
Use the clamp to control the flow, and fill your bucket or bag with clean, distilled water and any additional supplements.
Lie on your back, with your knees drawn towards your chest.
After you are comfortable, insert the nozzle about three inches into the anus.
Slowly release the clamp to start the flow of water.
After you have taken as much water as you can hold, gently remove the nozzle.
After you have retained the liquid for several minutes, sit on the toilet and relax.
Youâ€™re done!

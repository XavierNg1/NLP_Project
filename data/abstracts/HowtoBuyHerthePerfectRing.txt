Never be afraid to explore her jewelry tastes.
Don't hesitate to go to the mall and randomly walk into the jewelry store.
If she's showing you things she likes, or researching on things - listen!

,
Start looking.
Avoid getting anything smaller than 1/4k diamond when you're proposing, even if it's just a starter right and you want to go bigger later because you're broke.
Go to different stores and ask questions.
Figure out what size she is!,
Absorb any hints she provides you with, get what she wants, not what you want.
Remember that shape is important - heart, pear, princess, etc.
Ask her girlfriends and her mom!

,
Buy that darn ring, and give it to her!

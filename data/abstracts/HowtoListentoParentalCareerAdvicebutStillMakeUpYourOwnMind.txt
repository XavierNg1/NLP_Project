Understand that your parents want the best for you.
You are not your parents.
Talk to them about it.
If what your parents want for you not appealing to you, don't feel pressured to develop an interest in it.
Explain to your parents that in order to make an informed decision, you must consider more things than their opinion alone.

Be true to yourself.

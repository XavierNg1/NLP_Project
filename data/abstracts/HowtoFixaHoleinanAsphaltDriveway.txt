Measure or estimate the amount of filler material you will need to execute your repairs.
Select the asphalt filler you want to use for your repair.
Clean loose dirt and debris out of the hole with a garden shovel, a trowel, or other suitable tool.
Let the hole dry in the sun if there is water in it because the tar will not stick to the wet dirt.
Fill in holes that are more than three or four inches deep with a material that can be compacted tightly, such as clay, crushed concrete, or crushed limestone.
Fill the hole with the asphalt filler to about one half an inch above the adjacent paving.
Pack it down with a hand tamp, a gasoline powered plate compactor, or even a hammer for very small holes.
Cover the patch if possible.
Clean up your tools and any spilled material around your patch and admire your handiwork.

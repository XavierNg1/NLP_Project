Focus squarely on your mission objectives.
Pick the right class for the job:


Assault: Good at medium-range, mainly for offense but is flexible enough to use in many roles,especially assisting.
Teamwork is key.
Use the right weapon at the right time.
Use vehicles wisely; be careful of engineers and support players with C4, and focus on the objective; vehicles can be used in a variety of roles: offense, defence, troop transport, putting on pressure and distracting the enemy.

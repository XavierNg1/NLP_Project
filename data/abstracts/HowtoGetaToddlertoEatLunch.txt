Give fair warning, about 20 minutes before lunch is planned, that lunchtime is approaching and he or she will have to take a break from their free time in order to eat.

Let your toddler help you in preparing lunch.
Make the eating process fun.
Don't force them to try something new.
Involve your child in the clean-up process.

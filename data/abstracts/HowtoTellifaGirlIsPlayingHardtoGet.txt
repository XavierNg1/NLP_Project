Ask her out and see if she gives you an open-ended "no".
Contact her and see how long it takes for her to respond.
Watch if she shows you your competition.
Look for physical signs of flirting.
Listen carefully to the way she speaks to you.
Watch how she acts around you versus how she acts around others.
Play hard to get too.
Back off and give her space.

Choose the right hook.
Thread a slip sinker onto your line before tying the hook.
Tie the hook directly to your line.
Thread the plastic worm onto the hook for the distance between the hook's eye and bend.
Push the point of the hook out of the worm body and pull the hook through until the eye is just inside the head.
Turn the hook around and re-embed it in the body of the worm.

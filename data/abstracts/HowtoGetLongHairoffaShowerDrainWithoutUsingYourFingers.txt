Buy a fair-sized crochet hook.
Wear rubber gloves or disposable gloves and have a trash bag and paper towel ready.
Go into the shower with the hook and get on your hands and knees.
Take the crochet hook, poke it down the drain next to the hair, then pull it up so that the hair comes up, caught in the hook.
Repeat when more hair builds up.

,
If you have waited too long and a lot of the hair is down inside the drain, remove the plate and clean out the drain.

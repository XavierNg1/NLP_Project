Practice your speech at home or with a small group of people with whom you are comfortable.
Before your speech go to a park and just keep talking about your speechâ€”you don't have to speak to anyone, all you have to do is just speak to yourself about the topic.
Remember everything you need to cover in the speech.
Use only palm cards nothing else.
Speak up, but don't scream.
Move your hands to demonstrate what you are talking about.
If you have followed these steps then you can be confident.

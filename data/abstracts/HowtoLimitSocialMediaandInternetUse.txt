Think about why you are constantly using the internet or social media.
Consider your mental or emotional health that is at play as a result of too much social media use.
Write down the dates and times you turn on your computer, other device, or when you log onto a website.
Seek as much help as needed, whether it is from a close relative/friend, or even from a professional.
Identify the common websites and forms of social media you use.
Turn off cell phone and site notifications (Facebook notifications, email, etc).
Get rid of counterproductive accounts (eg: Deactivate Facebook account, delete Snapchat, etc).
Set timeframes for internet and social media use (time yourself, set a timer, download website blocking applications, etc).
Go out and find something else to do.

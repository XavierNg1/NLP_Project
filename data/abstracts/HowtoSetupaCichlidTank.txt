Plan ahead.
Get a large enough tank.
Clean everything using hot water.
Place the tank in a place that does not get too much sunlight.
Add the water filter and heater.
Fill the bottom 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to xx centimeters) with a clean substrate.
Don't worry about plants.
Choose some clean rocks with caves, pockets, or holes, and arrange them in your tank.
Fill the tank with water.
Place the cover on the tank and plug everything in.
Wait until the tank cycle has established before adding your fish.
Stick with only one species of cichlid.
Buy cichlids together when they are about the same size.
Plan on having 2 female cichlids for every male.
Choose tank mates with care.
Consider adding a bottom feeder.

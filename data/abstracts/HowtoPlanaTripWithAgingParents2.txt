Plan on stopping frequently.If you’re traveling by car, you should plan to stop at least once every two hours.
Check the condition of your car before you hit the road.Ensure the tank is full and the headlights, tail lights, and signal lights are operational.
Pack emergency supplies.Even if you get a tune-up and everything looks fine, there’s always the chance that you car breaks down.
Get to your destination early.Most aging parents tend to wake up early and go to bed early.
Bring creature comforts.A long road trip can be made more enjoyable if you and your parents are comfortable.
Schedule slow-moving tours.Most tour agencies are catered to travelers with limited time who want to see everything they can as quickly as possible.
Book your hotels carefully.
Be careful of steps.Depending on your parents’ health, they might not be able to accommodate going up steps.

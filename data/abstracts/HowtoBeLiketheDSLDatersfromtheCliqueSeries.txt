Let's start with the look- you've got to look amazing, 'cause as Skye puts it, "um, we're not exactly ugly"- so take great care of yourself, and soon you'll have a bf who wants to do the same...
Now for the style.
For the attitude, be super sweet, but tricky when needed.
Flirt all the time, and kiss nearly as much, but don't get a fixed boyfriend unless absolutely necessary (do not give up true love just to be like some character in a book, obviously.

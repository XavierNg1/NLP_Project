Set your grill up with a direct and indirect zone for heating.
Heat the grill up to roughly 225F/110C.
Add a few handfuls of damp BBQ smoking wood, like cherry or apple, to the flame and wait until it smokes.
Cook the ribs over the smoke for 3 hours.
Use a spray bottle to mist the ribs in apple juice once an hour.
Wrap the ribs in heavy-duty foil, leaving a small opening at one end.
Pour 1/2 cup of apple juice into the pouch, seal it, and cook for 1 hour.
Remove the ribs and cook once more over indirect heat, until they bend slightly when lifted.
Keep the hot, cooked ribs in aluminum foil and set aside in a cooler.
Crank the heat to high, or add a full, hot chimney of charcoal.
Brush the ribs liberally with your BBQ sauce, then cook them meat-side down for 2-5 minutes.
Finished.

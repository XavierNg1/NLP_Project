Basic fact that everyone has to understand is that you can't force a kid to develop a liking towards eating fresh and natural foods and follow healthy food habits.
To start with just make a note of the diet routine for a week i.e. the kind of food you are feeding your kid.
With the chart as reference you can do the following analysis


You will find most of the unhealthy diet routine will lack fruit in it.
The answer we can get it from nature which provides with lots of seasonal fruit.
Next step in the analysis will be to look for fast foods .Try to avoid much of the fast foods (might be tastier..but adds more toxins).Better to include steam- cooked foods.

,
Find whether the chart includes green vegetables may be cooked or raw(for example, spinach),and also for vegetables (for example, carrot) try to make these as part of the diet.

,
For growing children milk is a key ingredient, the source of calcium and protein.
Based on these observations from chart , now the task will be to change the diet routine accordingly by making a new chart.Make sure the new chart includes at least one fruit a day

,
Breakfast, lunch and dinner is not repeated with same food.
You are not feeding more of fried items to the kids .Make them get used to taste of fresh foods..in long run their taste will be inclined towards fresh foods rather than unhealthy foods.

,
Offer more of fresh juices rather than soft drinks to quench thirst.

,
Insist the kid to drink at least 1.5-2 liters (for kids) 3 liters (for adults) of water daily.

,
give importance to exercises.
Give equal importance to the hobbies like music, dance, etc. which is required for the physical and mental well being.

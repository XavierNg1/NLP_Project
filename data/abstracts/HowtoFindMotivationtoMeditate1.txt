List the reasons why you avoid meditation.Knowing why you avoid meditating is half the battle for motivating yourself to start.
Overcome the feeling that you don’t have time.Part of finding the motivation to meditate is realizing you don’t need as much time as you may think.You can also overcome the obstacle of feeling that you don’t have time if you meditate when it's least likely to be interrupted by other people or tasks.
Handle forgetfulness by scheduling meditation in.You may want to meditate, but simply forget to do it with so many other things on your mind.
Don’t let physical problems stop you.Even though most people picture the full lotus position when they picture someone meditating, there is no correct position for meditating.So, don’t let stiff knees, back problems, or other physical problems stop you from meditating.
Address your fears of failing.You may be afraid that you won’t be ‘good’ at meditating or be able to keep it up.
Meditate on your reasons for not meditating.If you have other reasons for avoiding meditation, analyze them and create your own solutions.

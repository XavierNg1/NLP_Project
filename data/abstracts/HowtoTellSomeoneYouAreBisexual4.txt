First make sure you are sure and gather evidence.
Practice makes perfect...

Make sure you are comfortable with the words you are going to have to use.
Plan what you are going to say, do you explain how you feel first and then say you are bisexual or do you do it the other way round?,
Think about your appearance, try and look grown up but not sexual.
Do not come out on Christmas or their birthday or some other family event.
Give them time, you are their baby.
If you have only told one parent they may want to tell the other straight away, if you are uncomfortable with this, explain why; they will listen.

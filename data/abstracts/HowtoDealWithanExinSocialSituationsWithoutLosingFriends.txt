Prepare your remarks in advance.
Control your venting.
Keep conversations with the ex's friends upbeat and pleasant.
Take the high road, always.
Keep your distance if behaving civilly seems impossible.
Behave cordially upon contact.
Anticipate that your ex may arrive with a date.
Remember why you attended the gathering and have fun.
Anticipate distance or complete loss of some mutual friendships.
Don't expect your friends to pick sides.
Be there for your friends as much as possible.
Avoid dating “just because.” There’s no need to find a stand-in date just to keep up appearances for your ex.

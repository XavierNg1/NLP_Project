Start eating healthy.
Run up to three miles everyday, (more if you are training for cross-country events).
Before running, warm up.
Gather data.
Practice your hurdling if you want to be a hurdler.
Keep in mind: if you are going to do long jump or triple jump, practice your bouncy sprint everyday.
Remember, for high jump, you can't practice without the track equipment.
Improve your distance.
Keep a daily sports journal and log-in all training sessions.
Participate in running events outside of school.
Congratulate yourself, because soon you'll be ready for track!

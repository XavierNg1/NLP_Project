Memorize using all your senses: Sight: Practice both with and without your sheet music.
Establish landmarks and footholds: Analyze and memorize the keys, scales, chords, and progressions that make up your piece, identifying them as you practice.
Outside factors and nerves can have surprising effects: Take into consideration the time of performance, weather and lighting conditions, clothing (does your outfit inhibit your range of motion), audience proximity and size, etc.

Slow down!,
No last minute procrastinating: Practice consistently for weeks or even months before the performance.
Eat a banana!,
What's the worst that can happen?

Bring the cream cheese to room temperature, then take a piece of wax paper and put your cream cheese on it.
Mix it all with your hands.
When it seems to have to correct consistency, add the flavor to taste and color to your liking.
Take a small ball of mint mixture in your hand and roll it around in the granulated sugar.
Let dry for 24 hours.
Store.

Treat a solo like a story, complete with characters, tension, and plot.
Start slowly and rhythmically, often repeating the basic groove of the song.
Keep time with either the hi-hats, bass drum(s), both, or none.
Figure out 2-3 "safe spots" that you can always come back to if you get lost.
Remember that more notes don't always equal a better solo.
Consider common "compositional ideas" to start practicing with structure.
End the solo by coming back in time, either softly or with a climactic bang.

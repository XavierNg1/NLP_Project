The whole point of the game is that there is one or more ghost and the rest of the people are Pac Man.
Choose a spot to play.
Find people who are willing to play.
Once you have assembled everything, you’re ready to set up the playing field.
Grab the rock or chalk and draw a shape that fits the whole area (unless if it’s really big).
Next, draw random lines that connect to the biggest shape you drew.
Draw a circle in the middle of the playing field.
Pick the person that is going to be the ghost.
Ask the ghosts to stay in the middle of the circle or choose any place.
Ask the Pac Men to stand in any place they like as long as it’s on a line.
When you start the game, everyone can run but the ghosts will chase the Pac Men which is the whole point of the game.
When a ghost successfully touches a Pac Man, the Pac Man sits down (to avoid confusion with players) on the place where they got touched which means they are ‘out’.
The ghost though has special privileges which let them pass the ‘out’ Pac Man no matter how many there are in a line.
When there is only one more Pac Man left, that person is acclaimed as the winner.

Start with long-keeping apple varieties.
Wrap each apple individually.Even apples that are in good shape give off a little ethylene gas, and as a result, apples that rub up against each other as they are in storage are more likely to rot faster.
Line a crate or cardboard box with insulation.The container should not be airtight, since you do not want to completely restrict airflow to your apples as you store them, but it should keep out most of the air.
Place your apples in the insulated container.
Store the apples in a cold location.
Do no store apples near potatoes.
Check your apples after a few months.

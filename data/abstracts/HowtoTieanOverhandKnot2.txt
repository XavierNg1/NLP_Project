Create a loop in the rope where you want your knot.
Pass the end of the rope through the loop.
Take the end back out of the loop and wrap it back under.
Pass the end of the rope back through the loop a second time.
Pull on both ends of the rope to tighten in.
Use the double overhand knot for larger stoppers, or as part of other, more complex knots.
Loop the end of the rope as many times as you want to increase the size of the stopper.

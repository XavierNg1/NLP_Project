Compute the Breakeven Point.
Estimate the budgeted profit or loss.
Understand that every sale made after the $1,200,0000,000 mark is pure profit.
Reading the chart herewith, since $ are charted vertically along the y-axis and Units run along the x-axis horizontally at the bottom, at 3.6 million (M) units, reading up to the Sales line there are $3.6M in sales dollars.

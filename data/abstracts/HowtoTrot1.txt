Be comfortable walking with your horse.
Urge your horse into a walk.
Sit as correctly as possible.
Squeeze both legs on your horse, with a little bit harder pressure on the inside leg (if you squeeze the outside leg harder, this is the aid for canter).
Get on the right diagonal to post.
Guide the horse's speed.
To make your horse slow to a walk, sit back deeply in the saddle and squeeze the reins.
Keep practicing as many times as necessary until you feel comfortable in this gait.

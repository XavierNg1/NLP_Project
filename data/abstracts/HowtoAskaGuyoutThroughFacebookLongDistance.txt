First of all, before asking anyone out, you will need to find out and make sure who your talking to is the actual person you know.
Browse their Facebook profile.
If you both have cell phones, start texting each other throughout the day.
Talk to the person and get to know them well, see if he or she is the right person for you.

,
One of the most important thing to do is flirt.
Flirting is fun, but also be aware what or how much you post on a Facebook wall of the person you are interested in.
Use MSN or Skype to connect with your crush and have a live video conversation.
After a while and once you have been talking and getting to know each other for a while, start giving hints in your messages.
Be sure this relationship will go somewhere.

,
If the person lives far from you or in another country, discuss between the two of you how willing the both of you are to meet up and see if there is a connection.
When your ready and you made your final choice, connect to your partner on a service like MSN or Skype because it would make it more open and you can see his/her reactions.
Arrange sometime in the future when you could meet him/her in person.

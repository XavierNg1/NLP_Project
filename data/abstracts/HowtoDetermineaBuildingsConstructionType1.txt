How building class is determined:
All buildings must be classified into one of six construction classes (see number 3).
What to ask:
To determine the ISO class of the building, we must therefore know the following composition of the building elements:


Structural frame
Bearing walls (interior and exterior)
Floor construction
Roof construction
What the fire rating of the materials

,
Building classes:
All construction types must be classified into the following (all of which are explained extensively below):



Frame Construction (ISO Class I, IBC Type V)

Joisted Masonry (ISO Class 2, IBC Type III, IBC Type IV)

Light Noncombustible (ISO Class 3, IBC Type IIB)

Masonry Noncombustible (ISO Class 4, IBC Type IIA)

Modified Fire Resistive (ISO Class 5, IBC Type IB)

Fire Resistive (ISO Class 6, IBC Type IA)

International Building Code (IBC) versus Insurance Services Office (ISO):
These are two major sources identifying construction types, both of which will be addressed in the construction types outlined below.

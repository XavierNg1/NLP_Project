Finding a good martial arts teacher for your children is ninety percent of the battle.
Get to know a couple of the mainstream Martial arts (judo, Karate, taekwondo and kickboxing, say) and learn what they have to offer and if each is right for your child.
You will need to spend a little time doing research.
If a school does not have formal teaching ranks, but appears interesting to you, then pay them a visit.
Once you are happy with the instructor, take a look at the facility your child will be training in.
Take a look at the costs you will have to incur if your children are members of the club.
Lastly, check to see that the martial arts club you choose has a record in your community.

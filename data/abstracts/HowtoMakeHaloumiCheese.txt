Heat the milk to 34ºC/93.2ºF.
Cover the milk with cling film, or the pot lid, if available.
Let sit 30 minutes until a "clean break" is formed.
Using a knife, cut the curds into 1 centimeter (0.4 in) cubes.
Transfer the curds into the colander lined with a tea-towel or cheesecloth.
Wrap the Haloumi in the cloth.
Slice the curd mass into wedges or thick slices of haloumi.
Heat the whey to simmering and add the salt.
Add the haloumi slices.
In your sterilized storage container, add the optional mint (to taste) and some whey to fill one-quarter of the container.
Store the cheese in the refrigerator until required.
Serve.

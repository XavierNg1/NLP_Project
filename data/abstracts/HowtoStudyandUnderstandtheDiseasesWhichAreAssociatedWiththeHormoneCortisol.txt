Learn about the importance of the hormone cortisol.
Cortisol secretion by the adrenal cortex is under a negative feedback control in which its excess in the blood inhibits the secretion of the pituitary hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone.
Know about the functions of cortisol.
People who administer cortisol as an anti-inflammatory agent can develop diabetes if the administration of the hormone is for along time such as occurs with people under a constant requirement to take this hormone as a supplement due to its deficiency in the body.
Learn about the main disorders that involve cortisol.
The second cause of cushing syndrome is excessive secretion of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland itself or due to ectopic secretion of this hormone by a malignant tumour in the body.
The other cause is ectopic secretion of this hormone which can be caused for example due to a malignant tumour of the lungs.
In addition to these two causes which involve secretion of the ACTH in excessive amount to the blood circulation by the pituitary gland and which is called cushing disease, the adrenal cortex itself can undergo pathological condition in which a tumour of the adrenal cortex can oversecretes cortisol causing symptoms of cushing syndrome.

,
The adrenal cortex can have adenoma or carcinoma which are possible causes of oversecretion of the hormone cortisol.
The other disorder which involves cortisol is addison's disease or hypocortisolism.
Addison's disease is manifested by increased secretion of ACTH which is oversecreted due to the lack of the negative feedback that cortisol usually makes on the secretion of ACTH.
This is caused due to the secretion of melanocytes stimulating factors by the pituitary gland the thing that increases the pigmentation of the skin.

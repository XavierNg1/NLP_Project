Before getting suspicious of your medium/psychic, remind yourself that their abilities are almost nothing like how the media portrays them.
Make sure they're asking specific questions, not something that seems 50/50.
Again, don't give questions out right away, give them time to focus.
Try to get readings from medium/psychics who work for companies like California Psychics.

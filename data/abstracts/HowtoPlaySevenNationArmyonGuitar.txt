Learn the implied guitar chords for the verse.

Review you power chords if you've never used them.
Learn the two-chord bridge into the chorus.
Start the chorus with two strums of an E power chord.

Slide right back to the E chord for one quick strum.
Hit the 5th fret, D power chord as you slide back up the neck.
Keep moving to the 3rd fret power chord.
Land the last power chord on the 2nd fret, then repeat the entire thing.
Listen to the song repeatedly to learn the rhythm and order of the song.
Internalize the rhythm from the bass guitar, as it is the same one used in the solo.
Move down to the 12th fret on the 1st string to kick the solo up a notch.
Replay the last section, avoiding the high-pitched notes on the 17th fret, to end the solo.
Use the bridge chords as your outro.

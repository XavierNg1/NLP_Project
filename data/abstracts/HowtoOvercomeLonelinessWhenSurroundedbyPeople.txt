Find others like you.
Listen to others.
Master the art of conversation.
Force yourself to socialize.
Understand that it's the quality of friend that matters, not quantity.
Avoid people who make you feel bad.
Surround yourself with friends.
Be persistent when it comes to finding people you like to associate with.

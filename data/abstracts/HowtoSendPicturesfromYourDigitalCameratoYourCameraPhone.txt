Upload the picture onto a computer.
Edit the picture to whatever size your phone allows, unless your phone resizes it automatically.
To transfer your photos:


If your phone has a USB/phone cable: then you can use it to connect your phone to your computer (via USB port) to transfer the pictures.
Find the e-mail address you need to mail to.
Address your email to that number and send the photo, as an attachment, to your phone.
Enable Bluetooth on your phone, if you haven't done so already.
If you don't already have it, or another program that deals with transfers, then download the latest version of Ringtone Media Studio.

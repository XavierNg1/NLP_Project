Decide whether you want to live in complete solitude or partial solitude.
Find a location away from large populations of people.
Purchase all the equipment you'll need to help you find a location, and make it livable.
Prepare yourself physically and mentally for this journey.
Once you arrive at the small airport near your destination, rent a vehicle, find a guide (who will be sent away later with the vehicle), buy weapons (they'll most likely be legal in any place you choose to settle in), buy lots of food, water and equipment.
The journey begins!,
Now that you are all by yourself, find a place to unpack your heavy bags.
Whatever geographical location you've chosen, you will have to travel a lot until you get to a good place of settlement.
Once you are settled in an isolated place away from those annoying humans, you have water and food available, and there is no danger for your life, enjoy the silence.

Start with clean, damp, tangle-free hair.
Pull your hair up into a bun, with the bottom layer loose.
Consider massaging some light-hold styling mousse into the bottom layer.
Take a ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) wide section of your hair and braid it.
Tie the braid off with a mini hair elastic and tuck the end unto the elastic.
Keep braiding in ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) wide sections until you reach the other side of your head.
Let down the next layer of hair.
Keep braiding and letting down layers until you have no more hair left to braid.
Consider adding a light mist of hair spray.
Let your hair dry.
Remove the braids when your hair is completely dry.
Style your hair as desired, but do not brush it.

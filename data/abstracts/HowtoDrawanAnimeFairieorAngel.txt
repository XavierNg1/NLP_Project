Pick a look and a pose.
Draw the head shape and roughly sketch out the pose of the angel or fairy you pictured in your mind.
Sketch out the hair, facial features and any jewelry, piercings, or other accessories you wish them to have.
Now add clothes, wings, antennae, and/or a tail to your angel or fairy.
Now it's time to look over your picture.
Darken the lines you want to keep, but keep the detailed textures you may have added to clothing or hair (don't add texture if you're going to color).

Add color (optional) Colour adds personality to anyone and anything.
Admire your beautiful picture and share it with others!

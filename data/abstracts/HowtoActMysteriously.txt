When people ask you what you're doing, simply smile and go on with your business.
Being mysterious is not about abandoning who you are, nor changing your interests.
Don't confuse being mysterious with being mean.
Often just read a book or draw.
Definitely don't laugh or smile a lot.
When you are outside, wear sunglasses all the time.
If you are at a social gathering, don't stay too long.

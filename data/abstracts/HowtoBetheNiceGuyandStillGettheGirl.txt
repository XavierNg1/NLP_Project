Be yourself.
Start off slow.
Keep talking.
Take the first step.
Don't be the bad guy.
Once you have the date, keep your composure.
Don't change anything.
Never leave, hang up, or sign off angry.
Always compliment her.
Know when to move forward.
Be the guy that is there for girls, whether it's a friend or your girlfriend.

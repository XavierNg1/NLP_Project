Understand that Sendmail uses information from the Domain Name System (DNS) to figure out which IP addresses go with which mailboxes.
Choose an available domain name.
Configure your DNS on the server.
Configure MX records for your domain (Note: CNAME records can not be used; see ยง 5.2.2 of RFC 1123 for details.),
Determine your connection method:

If the mail server which will serve your new domain has a full-time connection to the Internet, it should be the primary MX host for your domain.
Now the name servers are setup, register your domain using one of the registries.

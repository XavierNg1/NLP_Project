Always start with the most important rules and work your way down.
Base your rules on the rules of similar organizations.
Don't be redundant.
Don't be too harsh.
Don't be too soft.
Offer a clause for forgiveness.
Be prepared to alter your rules when necessary.
Ask for input from your organization's members.
Avoid democratic decisions for the rules.
If someone threatens to quit because they don't agree with the rules, side with the rules and let the person quit.
Some organizations don't need rules.
Only create rules you know can be enforced.
Only create rules you can follow.
For more immature organizations, offer rewards for following the rules.
Once you have created your rules, be proud of them and follow them.

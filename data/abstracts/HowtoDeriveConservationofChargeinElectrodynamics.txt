Begin with charge Q(t){\displaystyle Q(t)} in a volume V{\displaystyle V}.
Account for current I{\displaystyle I}.
Rewrite current in terms of charge density.
Invoke the divergence theorem for the surface integral.
Equate the two previous expressions and set it to zero.
Arrive at the continuity equation.
Begin with the Ampere-Maxwell Law.
Take the divergence of both sides.
Recall Gauss' Law.

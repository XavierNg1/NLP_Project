Learn your stuff: No matter what you are doing you should know what you are doing weeks ahead of the performance, lines should be learnt to the stage where they role of the tongue without much thought, this will prove very useful when you begin to feels nerves, they won't be as bad because you won't be nervous about forgetting them.
Stay Calm: There will be a lot of excitement backstage when everyone is getting ready but remember to keep yourself calm.
Stay hydrated: with the hot lights, fast pace and physical activity, it is easy to become dehydrated which may give you a head ache and therefore put you off, it can also reduce some of the natural anxiety you will feel before going on stage.

Eat something: evening performances are normally after meal times, but usually a performer has to be there well before, so it can be easy to forget about food.
Warm up well: To warm up, first screw your face up into the biggest frown you can make.
Get into character: It's not just about acting the part, it's about feeling the part.
Get prepared at the side of the stage: Get to your entrance point well ahead of time and keep quiet.
Have fun onstage: If you aren't used to an audience, then don't look at them but remember they are here to see you so they would love to see your face.
Smile!,
After the show: Congratulations!

Set your child up in an area with a chair, a table, and one marshmallow.
Tell your child the rules of the test:


You will put one marshmallow on the table where the child is sitting.
Leave the room once the child understands that he/she either gets to eat one marshmallow now or two later.

,
Wait.
Return and reward the child with an extra marshmallow if deserved.
Enjoy watching the video recording of the test with your whole family, and with the child when he or she gets older.

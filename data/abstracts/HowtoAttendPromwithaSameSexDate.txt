Talk to your date and ensure that they are comfortable attending prom with you.
Remember that some people may be homophobic, prejudiced, inconsiderate or just plain rude.
If you haven't already, let your other friends know that you are bringing a same-sex date with you to prom and that you may need support throughout the night (especially if you are aware that some people are prejudiced).
Remember that prom is about having fun, remembering the good times and enjoying yourself.
Be aware of your rights as an LGBTQ+ citizen.
Have fun!

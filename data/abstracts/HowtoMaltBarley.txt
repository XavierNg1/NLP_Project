Buy smaller quantities in the beginning.
Choose barley that is low in protein.
Inspect the barley before you take it home.
Purchase some food-grade buckets.
Fill a bucket with 1 to 10 lbs.
Fill the bucket with warm water.
Let the barley sit in the water for two hours.
Strain the barley with a fine strainer into another bucket.
Clean your first bucket.Return, strain and allow it to dry for eight hours.
Repeat the steeping and drying cycle one more time.
Choose a clean, cool surface on which to germinate the grains.
Spread the barley out in a single layer.
Mist them occasionally with cool water.
Split a kernel with a razor blade or knife to see how the acrospires are growing within the grain.
Choose your drying location.
Leave the malted barley in the oven or dehydrator for about 24 hours.
Dry the grain until it has low moisture content of about 10 percent.
Place the barley in a colander and shake the grains in small batches.
Bag your barley and use it within a few days to a week.
Consider toasting your barley at 275 degrees Fahrenheit (135 Celsius) for one hour to get a pale malt, or 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 Celsius) for 15 to 30 minutes, to get medium crystal malt.

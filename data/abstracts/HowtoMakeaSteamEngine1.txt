Cut an aluminum can to about 2 1/2 inches (6.35 cm).
Fold and crimp the cut rim with pliers.
Push the bottom of the can out from the inside to flatten it.
Punch two holes on opposite sides of the can 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) from the top.
Place a tea light candle in the center of the can.
Wrap the center of a 6-to-8-inch (15.24-to-20.32 cm) piece of the copper tubing around a pencil 2 or 3 times to make a coil.
Insert the ends of the tubing through the holes in the can.
Bend the ends of the tube with pliers to make 90-degree angles.
Set the can in the bowl of water with the tubing ends submerged.
Fill the tubes with water.
Light the candle.

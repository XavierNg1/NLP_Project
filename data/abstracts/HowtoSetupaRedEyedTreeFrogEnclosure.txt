Enclosure: Red eyed tree frogs are arboreal animals.
Substrate: Substrate, or ground covering is important, as it helps to make not only the cleaning process easier, but it helps with the aesthetics, humidity control and excrement (poop) collection.
Branches and climbing surfaces:



Bendable branches are great for altering the look and feel of the environment to your liking each time you clean.
Water Features: Obviously, frogs need water to survive, just like everything else.
Lighting/heating: Red eyed tree frogs aren't particular as to which type of lighting is used.
Feeding: Red eyed tree frogs love to eat.
Cleaning: Inspect your frog's enclosure daily and remove dead leaves from plants; excrement; dead, uneaten bugs.

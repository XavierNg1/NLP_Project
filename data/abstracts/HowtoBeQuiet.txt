Think before you speak.
Donâ€™t interrupt.
Ask questions instead of talking about yourself.
Count down from ten before you say something.
Listen carefully.
Stop complaining.
Focus on your breath.
Take time to process what you hear.
Find a hobby that requires quiet.
Release your energy in other ways.
Fight the temptation to chat online.
Take breaks from social media.
Write in a journal.
Meditate.
Appreciate nature.
Turn off the music.
Give it time.

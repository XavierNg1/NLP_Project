Make a decision that you will no longer gamble, and mean it.
Get rid of your credit cards.
Sit down and evaluate your finances, including all your other obligations above and beyond the casino debt.
Create a budget that pays off your debt and monthly expenses.
Choose your largest debt with the highest interest rate, and start paying more than the minimum balance on this.
Throw any extra money at the debt, and you will see it slowly decrease.

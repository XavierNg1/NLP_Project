Prepare yourself.
Do something special before they leave.
Expressing emotion on the day of their departure is fine.
Distract yourself after they leave.
It's okay to contact your spouse during their trip.
Make a countdown.
Try to fill every day, rather than moping around the house.
Stay positive.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder, but don't skimp!,
Give yourself time to cry.

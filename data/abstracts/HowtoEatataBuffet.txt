If at all possible, do a preliminary scouting of the buffet.
Make a plan in your head on how you want to eat.
As you go up to get food, approach the process like a mission.
The most important part of the process - MINI TASTING PORTIONS.
Make a couple of trips to get your tasting portions.
If you get a tasting portion and hate the food, don't feel like you have to finish it.
When you identify the really, really great items, go back and get a little bigger portion to enjoy it.
When moving on to the dessert items, follow the same plan!

Get a notebook.
Figure out why you have low grades.
Why are those reasons happening?,
How can I improve?,
What should I improve on?,
Once you are positive you have improved, cross that off and move down the list.
Stay devoted to getting better grades.
Keep in mind that middle school is a lot of responsibility, so is improving your grades.
After a few weeks, you should notice an improvement in your grades if you were responsible and made an effort.
Know the biggest message: Every student is different!,
If you don't want people to know that you are studying so you don't get seen as a know-it-all or a geek, but still don't want your grades to drop, do your studying in your room when you know you won't be distracted by your friends or anyone else.

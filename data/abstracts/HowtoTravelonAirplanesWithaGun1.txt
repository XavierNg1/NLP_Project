Get a good case.
Some people feel that scopes should be dismounted before travel.
Use a NON-TSA approved lock.
For guns, the first step on arriving at the airport is to proceed directly to the baggage check-in -- you cannot use curb-side check-in.
The attendant will ask for a declaration that the gun is unloaded.
Ammunition can be packed separately in your checked luggage or in the same case as the gun (as long as it is .75 caliber or less, that is).
The TSA inspection is usually pretty cursory.
Once the inspection is complete, close and lock the case and put away your key.

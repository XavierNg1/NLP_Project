Find out what kind of books they like.
Buy around 10 books of their choice.
A collector would also love it if you can find a rare book, maybe a first or second print edition.
Once you have your books in place, buy a nice basket.
At the base of the basket (if it's not a stiff material) put in a piece of cardboard.
Put some confetti or coloured bits of paper and add them at the bottom.

,
Put the books inside the basket, the way you would put them in shelves.
Now take a big sheet of transparent paper (coloured/patterned/plain), big enough to cover your whole basket.
Wrap your entire basket in it and tie it on the top with a cute ribbon.
Watch the book lover's smile as they receive their favourite gift.

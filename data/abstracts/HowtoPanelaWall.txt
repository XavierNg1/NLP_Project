Select the type of paneling you like best, as there are many wood options to choose among.
Measure the room you would like to install paneling in, so you can calculate exactly how much you need to purchase.
Purchase the wood paneling.
Lay out the wood panels in the room you will be installing them in, and allow them to acclimate to the room temperature and humidity level for approximately 2 to 5 days.
Position the first panel at the corner of the first wall, and use a second person to hold the wood.
Remove the first panel from the wall, and shave the edge along your marked line with a saber saw.
Ask your helper to assist you.
Repeat the installation process with the next panel piece, and continue along the wall or walls until you have completed the room.

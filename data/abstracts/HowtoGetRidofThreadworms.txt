Take one dose of an anti-worm medication.
Take another dose at the two week mark.After two weeks have passed, you will be directed to take one more dose of the same anti-worm medication.
Treat everyone in the household.Since threadworms are so easily passed from one person to another, your doctor will likely recommend that everyone in the household be treated with two doses of the anti-worm medication.
Know that medication is your best bet.
Understand how threadworms are spread.Threadworms can be transmitted from person-to-person contact with an infected person, as well as from touching objects that may be contaminated with eggs such as a toilet seat, bedding, or other things.
Wash toilet seats daily.Because eggs are laid around the anal area, it is important to clean the toilet seats at least once a day to avoid contaminating others with threadworm eggs, and also to avoid re-infecting yourself with more eggs.
Wash your hands regularly, especially if you are infected.Pay particular attention to washing your hands both before meals and/or food preparation, as well as after using the toilet.
Change your bed sheets at least twice a week.In order to effectively get rid of threadworms, you need to change and wash your sheets to get rid of any eggs that may be present.
Avoid scratching around the anus.Because female worms migrate toward the anus and lay eggs there, the anus can become particularly irritated and itchy.
Recognize the symptoms of a threadworm infection.The sooner you can catch the infection the better, as that way you can start medical treatment and hygienic prevention measures at home as soon as possible.
Administer a "tape test.
Opt for treatment anyway if you live in the same household.It is key to understand that if you are in the same household as someone diagnosed with threadworms, you will be advised to take the medication (and to practice the hygienic measures) without needing to be formally diagnosed with threadworms.

Motherboard:


This is arguably the most important component in the computer.
Processor:


The processor is to the computer as the frontal-lobe is to your brain.
Video card (AKA Graphics card or GPU):


This is either a critical component, or a negligible one depending on what the computer will do.
Hard drive (AKA HDD):


Two primary aspects of the hard drive to consider are capacity and performance.
Memory (AKA RAM):


This component allows your computer to cache files in temporary, fast memory, which allows you computer to do many smaller things faster than it normally would.
DDR3 is the most common now and is available cheaply from many reliable sources.
Sound card (not included in total price):


Sound cards are usually only added to motherboards without on-board sound, those who require nothing but the best quality sound, or those who do audio editing.
Case, monitor, optical drive(s), mouse, and keyboard:


Case: the case should be large enough to house all your components, and larger if you want the installation to be easy.
Operating System (AKA OS): For home users, Windows 7 Home Edition will be perfectly fine.

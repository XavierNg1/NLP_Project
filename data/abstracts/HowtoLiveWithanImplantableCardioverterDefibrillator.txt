Understand how an ICD works.
Learn about your condition and the reason(s) why you need this device.
In the first few weeks after the surgery, avoid putting your arm on the side the device was inserted over your head.
Be prepared for changes.
Carry an ID card indicating you have an ICD.
When possible, stay away from anything that may cause interference to your ICD.
Avoid rough sports that use constant body contact.
Beware of driving, especially within the first few months of implantation.
Respond calmly to shock experiences.
An ICD may be a good choice for you at one time in your life, but sometimes health status changes over time (due to heart or other disease progression) can make the ICD less beneficial.
Attend your regular appointments with your cardiologist.

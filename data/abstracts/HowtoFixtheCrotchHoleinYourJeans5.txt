Find a patch or suitable patching material.
Cut out a patch at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) larger on all sides than the hole.
Place the patch over the hole, lay your jeans flat, and pin the patch to the jeans.
Sew in the patch with a sewing machine.
Or sew it in by hand.
Re-sew around the perimeter of the hole if necessary.
Trim any loose edges.

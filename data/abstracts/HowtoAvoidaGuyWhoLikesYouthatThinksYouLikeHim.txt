Tell him you don't like him.
Pretend that he doesn't exist.
Forbid your friends to give him your personal info, including your telephone number, MSN address, email address, etc.
One way guys try to get a girl's attention is to hover around her or try to have physical contact with her (ex: brushing past).
Although this can be risky, this trick will put him down if you do this correctly.
Stay away from him as much as possible.
Whenever your friends talk about him, make fun of him a little bit, but be careful not to get carried away.
If he keeps on flirting with you like hitting you in the head or messing with your hair, simply turn around and firmly tell him to stop.
Smile when he is upset about you not liking him.

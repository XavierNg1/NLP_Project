Wade out into shallow water and stand directly next to the board.
Place your paddle horizontally across the board.
Hold the board on its sides.
Lift one knee out of the water, and pull the board toward you.
Shift your weight so your body is directly above the paddleboard, and bring your other knee to rest on the traction pad.
Consider taking a few strokes in the kneeling position so you can get a feel for the board.
In the kneeling position, lean forward and place the paddle horizontally across the deck of the board.
Slowly stand one foot at a time, placing your feet on the sweet spot where your knees where.
Rise to a standing position, adjusting your feet as necessary.
Start paddling!

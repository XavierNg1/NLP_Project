Decide to strip your diapers if the diapers smell directly out of the wash, or if they smell strongly of more than urine when your child uses them.
Turn your hot water heater up for the duration of your load of laundry.
Place a load of cloth diapers in the washing machine.
Place on the hottest wash setting and a hot or warm rinse setting.
Repeat the process 2 to 3 times, using very hot water for the wash cycle.
Repeat this process every month to 3 months, depending upon the smell, the softness of the water and the baby products that build up.

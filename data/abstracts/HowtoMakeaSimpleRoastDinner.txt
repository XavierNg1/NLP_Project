Prepare the oven roaster.
Place the whole roast of chicken, beef, pork or lamb on top of the vegetable platform.
Blob the butter (use a quarter pound to half pound) in a few blobs on top of the meat.
Place loaded down pan in oven, uncovered.
After about one hour, check liquid level in pan and add a little more water if needed.
After another hour (that is two hours total), check the liquid level again, add more water if needed and turn oven down again to low.
Wash the lettuce and put in a salad bowl, then set the vinegar, oil, bread and butter on the table.
Take out roaster and serve, using juices in the bottom of the pan as a gravy.
Serve each person from the pot as they wish, adding a little of the juices that the dinner cooked in.
Finished.

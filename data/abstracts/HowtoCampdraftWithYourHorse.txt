Before you even think about beginning to campdraft, you need to ensure that both you and your horse are up to the job.
If you have never seen a campdraft before, it is probably a good idea to go for a look first.
Go to a small campdraft first.
Like any sport, you will need to warm your horse up before you run.
Once you and your suitably warmed up horse are ready, you should head to the camp.
Pick the right horse.
OK, so you've picked your beast and the announcer has just called your name.
Start when you are told to and not before.
You have finished your yard work, you need to call out for the gate at the front of the camp to be opened.
Now is the scary part.
HAVE FUN.
Now go and waste some money on entry fees.

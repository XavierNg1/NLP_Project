Get a copy of your schoolâ€™s dress code and read it carefully, and look for loopholes.
Go through the clothes you have now and see what you have that fits within the guidelines of the dress code that you will actually wear.
Pay attention to little things in the dress code that aren't restricted.
Also, most dress codes require that you wear the uniform, but do not specify that you must only wear the uniform.
Shop at your favorite stores or designers.
Choose shoes that make news.
Accessorize.
Push the envelope.
Your hair doesn't have to be boring!

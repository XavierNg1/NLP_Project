Read your ban message.
Read the reason for your ban closely.
Contact the forum moderator or administrator.
Decide what you will do next if you aren't successful in getting through.
If you receive a negative response and the moderators decline your case, try to send your email again and ask for further clarification.
If you do not succeed in overturning a ban, then you may wish to inform the moderator or administrator that you're leaving the site reluctantly and against your will.
If you consider that you are a clear case of moderator's power abuse, then informing the admin might be the best thing you can do, since he or she will then reconsider his or her opinion regarding whom he or she trusts with the day-to-day running of the site.
If you are given a definite end to the ban time, consider just sitting out your ban before returning.
On the other hand, if you are still permanently banned, try creating another account if that forum/website allows it.

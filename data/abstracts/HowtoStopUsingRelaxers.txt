Decide whether or not a natural style is for you.
Make sure you have the proper tools.
If you've been relaxing your hair for a long time or your hair is exceptionally brittle, you may also want to do a hot oil treatment.
Combine the hot oil with a bonnet type hair dryer, and cover your hair with a plastic cap before putting your head under the dryer.
What you do next depends upon how you intend to wear your hair, and how much patience you have.
Whichever method you decide to use, some of the key things to remember are to keep it clean and moisturized (and that doesn't mean use hair grease, but that's another story!)

Prep your palette.
Paint a blob on the side of your egg with a paintbrush.
Add another blob on top of the first one.
Make a small dot in the middle of you flower for the stamen.
Blend it in with your original color, if desired.
Let the paint dry completely.
Draw a flower shape over the blob using a black, brush-tipped marker.
Add the stamen.
Add some leaves.
Fill the leaves in with green paint.
Let everything dry.

Bring some grain.
Approach slowly from an angle where the goat can see you and the grain bucket.
Offer the feed.
To pin against a wall, place one knee in front of the shoulder blade and the other knee behind the ribs and lean into it.
Once caught, the goat should be tethered to a secure object by a chain or strong rope.

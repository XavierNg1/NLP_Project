Start your Trackmania Nations Game and look for a server with professional built maps (preferred technical maps (lot of turns, almost no loops/wallrides));
,If you play this game for the first time, start the solo mode and first practice on all nadeo maps (beginner, advanced, expert AND pro) trying to get the green medal on every track to get the basics and get to know the physics of your car better

The secret in this game is the intended sliding.
The following points describe the different types of slides you will need to make everyone (or ALMOST everyone) swallowing your dust.

,
Basic/Beginner Slide - nearly every(including me) player begins the sliding thing with the basic slide i.e.
Power Slide - The more used slide between the professionals is the power slide.
Pulsative Slide - This is a very tricky slide.
Ramstone Slide - What is the Ramstone?,
Slow Slide - This kind of sliding is not very famous among the community.
Wallbang - This is not a slide but it's another technique to get pro.
Jump + Slide - Useful when you have a lot of speed, but there is a long or sharp turn right after a jump and landing, and you do not have time to brake.
These are the most important techniques used by good drivers in Trackmania nations.

Walk with a rolling fashion.
When walking up a hill or grade, if the ground is dry and has traction, maintain the rolling walking technique.

,
Use a walking stick when going uphill so you can keep your balance and keep the rolling, walking movement.
Walk uphill in a different route which is more step-like or less slippery (so you can walk in a rolling fashion).

Make a heel cup, have a shoe repair person add some height to your heel, or make a makeshift insole.

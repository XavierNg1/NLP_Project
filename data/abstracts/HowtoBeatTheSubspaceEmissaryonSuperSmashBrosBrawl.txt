Set up the game by starting up Super Smash Bros. Brawl in your Nintendo Wii.
Select "Solo" mode, then "The Subspace Emissary".
Watch the cutscenes as they play.
When each cutscene ends, the scene stops and you can pick your favorite four characters out of the group.
There are two different types of stages in the game.
If you find glowing blue or orange cubes, break them!,
When you finish a level, you will see a map of all the levels you have played through so far.
If you are finding a level difficult, you can add stickers by selecting "Stickers" on the map screen.
At any point when you return to the map screen, you can save your progress by selecting the "Save" option.
Play through each level in the story, including the very long one at the end.

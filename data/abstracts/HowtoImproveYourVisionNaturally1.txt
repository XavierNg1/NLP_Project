Find a pencil, and mark it somewhere in the middle.
Hold the pencil in front of your face, at arm's length.
Focus your eyes on the mark you drew on the pencil.
Slowly move the pencil toward your face, maintaining your focus on the same spot.
Stop when you see two pencils.
Look away for a few seconds, or close your eyes.
Look back at the pencil.
Slowly move the pencil away from your face.
Repeat the exercise.

You must calculate how much air expands in your gun's firing chamber.
To lessen the concussive blast to lessen sound, substitute an open ended egg carton taped to the barrel for the pipe.
If you want to get some steel wool and line the inside of the pipe or bottle with it, the steel wool will absorb the sound a little better.

Accept that failure is normal.
Let go of self harm.
Be aware of negative self commentary, "I'm an idiot", "I'm no good at this", "I will never be able to that".
Learn to let things go.
Be at one with your own smile.
Learn to laugh at yourself.
Do not compare yourself to others.
Be realistic.
Don't be judge and jury of yourself.
Do not worry what others think of you so much.

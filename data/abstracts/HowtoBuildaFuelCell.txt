Gather all of the necessary materials.
Cut two 6-inch (15-centimeter) strips of platinum or platinum-coated wire.
Wind each wire strip around a thin metal rod to shape it into a spring.
Cut the leads from a 9-volt battery clip in half.
Attach the exposed wire ends to the electrode coils.
Tape the electrodes to a popsicle stick or dowel rod.
Fill the glass with tap water or salt water.
Lay the stick over the mouth of a glass of water.
Connect the wires coming from the electrodes to a voltmeter or LED bulb.
Touch the 9-volt battery terminals to the battery clip for one to two seconds.
Remove the battery.
Read the output on the voltmeter.

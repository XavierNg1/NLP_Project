Crime stories are separated into three areas: Fiction, Non-Fiction and Half-Fiction.
If you want to write true crime stories, you will need to gather data.
Research about that crime.
After gathering all this information, write in your journal or some notebooks, piecing the small bits into a coherent whole.
Then a choose two or more themes for your story (eg: Romance, Violence, Humor/Comedy, Epic/Heroic, Religious, Friendship or anything that comes into your mind).

,
Choose your title first before the body of the story as the title will help you follow the theme.
Jot down the sequence/plot of your story before you write the actual scripts, in chronological order.
List the characters.
And finally, come up with your story.

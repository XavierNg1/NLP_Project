Wash, peel, and dice the vegetables and apples.
Cut the pork tenderloin into small cubes.
Season the tenderloin with salt and pepper, then toss it with flour until evenly coated.
Heat 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of extra-virgin olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over high heat.
Sear the pork in the oil, about 7 to 8 minutes, then transfer it to a platter.
Add the rest of the oil into the pot, along with the vegetables and herbs, and cook for 6 to 8 minutes.
Add the apples, allspice, and cranberries, and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes.
Pour in the apple cider, then scrape the bottom and sides of the pot with a wooden spoon.
Add the chicken stock and pork tenderloin, bring the stew to a boil, then simmer for 8 to 10 minutes.
Remove the herbs, then serve the stew.

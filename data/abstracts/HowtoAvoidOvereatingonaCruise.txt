Understand that it is almost impossible to avoid eating more than you usually do on a cruise ship.
Realize that you don't always have to take that fancy hors d'oeuvre or beverage which waiters will often come up and offer to you.
Eat breakfast and dinner in the ship's dining room.
Request a special or dietetic version of your meal.
Limit your beverage intake.
Eat lunch at the buffet restaurant.
When eating at the buffet, don't overdo it.
Skip the midnight buffets!,
Get creative by making a meal plan for your cruise and stick to it.
Work off those desserts.
Keep in mind that it's not a bad idea to splurge every now and then.
Eat slowly it is a good way to try everything you like without feeling deprived; you will avoid overeating and will feel satisfied with less food.

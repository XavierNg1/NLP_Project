Be aware that it is important to be safe but it is also important to be realistic.
Watch the disposition of people you don't know online.
Understand that if a person on the chat starts the conversation by asking your age, where you live, your contact number and if your parents work, such questions are a red flag.
Allow your inner self to hear what they are saying.
Be especially alert when any stranger tries to be your friend when it's a "friends only" space.
Listen to your inner sense of something not being right.
Do not give out personal information online.
Avoid using photographs.
Immediately cease to talk to a person who makes offers of a meeting, a prize or anything similar.
Keep it public.
Use the power of the block.
Keep a record.
If you get a message telling you not to tell your parents about your chat or relationship, don't reply.
Report any sexual and profane language such as "You wanna do?".
Report cyber-violence.
If someone hurts you or makes you feel uncomfortable, online or offline, always tell someone rather than repressing.
Know you are not alone.

If you think that you are being followed, occasionally stop as you walk around- maybe to tie a shoelace, look for something in your pocket, or admire something in a store window, etc.
If there is, continue walking.
Once that you are certain that you are being followed, make a note of what the person looks like.
When you are out of sight, quickly change your clothes, or stash accessories in your clothes.
Speed up.
Try to shake off the tail.
If you feel you are REALLY in danger, contact the police or an adult.

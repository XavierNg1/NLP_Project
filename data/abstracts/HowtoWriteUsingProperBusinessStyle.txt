Use short, simple sentences and short paragraphs.
Write in active voice unless it's important to disguise who took the action.
Think about what the company would say, not what you say.
Avoid jargon, unusual terms and made-up words unless they're the standard in your industry and you're sure everyone understands them.
Ensure that your verbs haven't been turned into nouns.
Talk about action, and don't weaken statements with qualifiers.
Make lists whenever possible.

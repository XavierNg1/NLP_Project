Cut or unwind the old handlebar tape.
Wash off any lumps of adhesive left by the old tape.
Set up your workstation and prepare the bars for taping.
Start each handlebar from the bottom, wrapping clockwise on the right and counter-clockwise on the left.
Leave about half the tape hanging off the bottom of the bar on the first pass, wrapping 3-4 times as you work up.
Work slowly, overlapping about a quarter of the tape with every turn, as you move up the bar.
Lift the lever body (rubber covering at brakes/shifters) and wrap past this point to get to the top of the bars.
Reverse your wrapping direction for the top of the bars.
Cut the tape at your desired length and finish wrapping.
Add some 2-3 wraps of electrical tape to hold the wrap in place.

Remove the head, unless it is to be used for taxidermy purposes.
Wash the outside of the snake thoroughly.
Make an incision down the centerline of the belly, through the skin only, all the way from the stump where the head was attached to the base of the rattle.
Pull the skin from the flesh by hand, again beginning at the head end, using even tension on the skin to avoid tearing.
Remove the viscera (innards) by hand, starting at the head end, using a scooping motion with the hand if the organs are difficult to remove.
Rinse the now eviscerated and skinned snake in cool water to remove any excess blood or other undesirable substances.
Cut the snake into segments that are the most convenient length for the desired method of cooking.

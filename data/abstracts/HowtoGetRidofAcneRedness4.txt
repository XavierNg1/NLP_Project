Be careful about using makeup on acne-prone skin.
Buy non-oil based cosmetics.
Apply a thin layer of concealer to the pimple.
Use your fingers to feather and blend the concealer.
Apply foundation to the rest of your face using a makeup sponge.
Use a powder brush to gently tap some loose powder onto the pimple to set the makeup.
Reapply as needed.

Start with a visit to your favorite local craft store.
Choose an 8.5" x 11" vellum style(see-through)paper.
Pick out an embellishment.
Your next goal will be to pick out what will hold the two papers together.
Using http://www.invitationland.com/, create a basic invitation.
Print 4 per a page, on the three vellum pages.
After they are done drying, stamp them, embellish them, whatever you're gonna do.

,
Then cut them out.
Line up your print-outs on your chosen 12x12 paper or something similar.
Line them up and attach them to the base paper using brads or ribbon.

,
Cut them out using a cutter or scissors, which ever you prefer.

Congratulations on your inexpensive, baby shower invitations!

If you want to go out with him, then just say yes.
If you don't want to go out with him, don't say yes.
Try to give a definite answer of either yes or no.
If you don't like the guy that way, then say no in a nice way.
Never say yes if you don't want to be his girlfriend.
If you do say no try to put him down gently, but don't go on and on.
If you want a date with him, but you think the time is not suitable, just propose another time, so that he doesn't take it as a rejection.

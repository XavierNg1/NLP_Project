Prefer boarding across a solid platform if possible.
Hold on.
Keep your balance.
Once in the boat, always remain in the centre line to move around it and lower yourself to a crouch level so that you reduce your centre of gravity and keep the craft as still as possible.
Keep the craft steady as others board.

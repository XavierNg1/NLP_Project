Make a sourdough starter.
Make a sponge using half of the starter from the first step (not a critical measurement) and adding more flour and yeast.
To the sponge, add 4 cups of flour (this should be 8 1/2 cups total), 1/4 cup honey, 1 1/2 tablespoons of Kosher or Sea salt, and 2 tablespoons of the cornmeal.
Put the kneaded dough back into the mixer bowl and let it rise until approximately double -- about 45 minutes to an hour or so.

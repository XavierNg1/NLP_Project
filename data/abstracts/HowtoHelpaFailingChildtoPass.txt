Determine what the real issue or problem is.
Speak with the child's teacher/instructor on what he or she thinks the issue is.
What are your own limitations, as a parent, tutor, friend, etc.
Survey the situation.
Put together a plan, using what you know about the situation, for improvement.
Stick to the plan, but also adjust as you get new information or results.

When the class/subject is over, re-asses the results, and see if you would like your child to go at a slower pace in future classes, or if they are now ready to progress without as much monitoring.

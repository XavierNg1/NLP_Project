Be nice to friends of your friends.

Think about how often you need your friend around.
Determine whether or not you are the one who initiates everything.
Count how often you call or text your friend.
Think about how often you feel worried that you’re not being included.
Talk with someone about your insecurities.
Keep up with your family and responsibilities.
Have hobbies that you do on your own.
Build your self-confidence.

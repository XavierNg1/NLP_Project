At the beginning of each game, always take some time to open up the map of the land (press M to bring it up) and analyse how much space you have to create your dungeon.
Build the primary rooms (Treasure Room, Hatchery, Lair and Training Room) near your dungeon heart.
Dig towards the portal and claim it.
Build the secondary rooms (such as The Barracks, Torture Chamber, Library, Workshop etc...) on the outsides of your primary rooms.
Force your Imps to fortify all walls so enemy intruders cannot breach your dungeon.
Allow a wide variety of creatures to come and live in your dungeon.

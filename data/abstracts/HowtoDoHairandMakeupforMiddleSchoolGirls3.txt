Stick with neutral colors when applying eye shadow.
Stick to using concealer; not foundations.
When applying lip gloss, be sure you don't put on more than you need.
Only use a little mascara - too much will look awful.
Try different looks - with and without mascara, with and without lip gloss, etc.
Find the inner you and only put one what looks best on you.

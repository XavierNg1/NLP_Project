On the night before Christmas eve, set your alarm clock for 8:00.
When you get up, ask your parents if you can have something special for breakfast (like waffles and hot chocolate) and if they let you have it, enjoy it.
Next, get dressed and groom yourself.
If you haven't already, wrap up all of the Christmas presents you have left to wrap and if they are for someone who lives with you put them under the tree and if not, ask your mom if you can drive to their house to deliver their gift!

,
When you get home, do some fun Christmas crafts.
Help your parents with baking.
Read Christmas stories.
Go to church.
Put on some Christmas music and dance to it or just sit and listen.
Watch a Christmas movie with your family!,
Take some pictures of you and your family!,
Get into your pajamas and brush your teeth.
By now it will be time to go to bed.

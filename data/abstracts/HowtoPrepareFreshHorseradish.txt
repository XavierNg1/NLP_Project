Buy fresh horseradish root (or grow it!).
Use caution as you cook.
Clean and peel thoroughly, discarding ends.
Grate with a food processor.
Add vinegar.
Strain the horseradish.
Color the horseradish, if desired.
Make a classic horseradish cream: Whip cream to stiff peaks, then incorporate the white, grated mixture to taste, by folding in.
Try adding your horseradish paste to favorite recipes that take well to seasonal twists.
Finished.

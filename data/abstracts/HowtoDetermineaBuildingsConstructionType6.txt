Classification:
Modified Fire Resistive construction is ISO Class 5.
Building elements:
Modified Fire Resistive Buildings are buildings where the exterior bearing walls and load-bearing portions of exterior walls must be of noncombustible materials or of masonry, but exterior nonbearing walls and wall panels may be slow-burning, combustible, or with no fire- resistance rating.
Variations:



Structural steel protection: Note that modified fire-resistive buildings also include structural steel protection techniques â€” fire-protection material applied to steel.
Advantages:


uses noncombustible materials
allows greater height and area than other construction classes
uses load-bearing members or assemblies that resist damage from fire

,
Disadvantages:


expensive to construct and repair
provides a false sense of security

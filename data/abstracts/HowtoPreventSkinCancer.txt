Protect yourself from the sun.Take the following steps while outdoors:


Wear a hat with a wide brim to shade your head, ears, face, and neck.
Use sunscreen.
Try to stay in the shade.
Protect yourself even on cloudy days.
Take extra precaution if you have multiple risk factors.
Avoid tanning.
Be aware of any "sun-sensitizing" medications you may be taking.Some medications carry with them an increased sensitivity to sun damage.
Take note of any new skin lesions.If you notice that a new spot, mole, or other unusual lesion has appeared on your skin, pay careful attention to it.
Look for asymmetry.If you find a lesion on your skin that is asymmetrical, it is more likely to be skin cancer or a precursor lesion for skin cancer than one that is symmetrical.
Examine the border of your skin lesion.Is it a smooth and well-defined border, or a jagged and irregular one?,
Be aware of the size.
Notice the color.Lesions with uneven pigment throughout are of higher risk, as are lesions that are abnormal in color (such as very dark brown, black or blue, or showing irregular shades that vary throughout the lesion).
See your doctor if in doubt.
Understand that most skin cancers are easily curable.Even though the word "cancer" can strike fear in us the moment we hear it, skin cancer is actually one of the most curable forms of cancer.
Biopsy or excise any worrisome lesions.When you see your doctor and show them your skin lesion, they will evaluate it and may recommend biopsying (taking a sample of) or excising (completely cutting out) any lesions that are potential cancers.
Evaluate the "margins" after excision.

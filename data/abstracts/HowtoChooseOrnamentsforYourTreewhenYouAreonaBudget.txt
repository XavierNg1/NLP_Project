First calculate the budget that you will spend on your Christmas Tree Decorations.
Reuse, Reduce, Recycle.
When you collected all the ornaments or decorations that can be repaired do the following:


If a decoration is slightly cracked, consider painting over it, or putting a light coat of glue on it, then sparkles on top to cover it and the glue will harden it.
After you fixed all the broken ornaments, put them on the tree and organise them properly (spread them out evenly).
Seek out deals on decorations before Christmas.
Make beautiful ornaments by hand too!,
Look around the house for things that can be transformed into some awesome "Christmas tree decorations".
Usually, before Santa comes, the bottom of the tree looks pretty empty, so consider putting a beautiful large cloth at the bottom (usually a dark colour with Christmas images), or wrap up empty boxes neatly to make it look filled.
Choose a theme.

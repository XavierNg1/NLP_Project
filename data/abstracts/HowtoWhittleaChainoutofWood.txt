Start with a piece of wood that's relatively square and is already as long as the chain that you wish to carve.
Cut a notch into the length of the wood on each corner of the wood so that the wood's profile becomes a cross instead of a square.

,
Draw the desired shape of each link onto the piece of wood using a lead pencil.
Begin to rough out the shapes with the knife, following the lines you've marked.
Refine the shapes of each link, and shape the individual profile of each link.
Make use of the chain.

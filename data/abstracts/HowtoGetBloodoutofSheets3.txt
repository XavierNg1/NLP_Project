Don't forget about your mattress and mattress protector.
Dampen stains on mattress protectors first with cold water.
Try a paste made from cornstarch, hydrogen peroxide, and salt.
Blot stains on mattresses with white vinegar or hydrogen peroxide.
Use the same stain-removal treatments on comforters and mattress protectors as you would on a bed sheet.

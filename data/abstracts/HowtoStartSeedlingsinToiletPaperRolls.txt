Plan your project.
Collect the materials needed for the seedling starters.
Start the assembly.
Stuff each ring with approximately 1 meter of toilet paper.
Write the name of the seeds you intent to plant on the outside of the toilet paper rings.

,
Place each stuffed ring on the table.
Place the complete seedling starter in the plate with the seeded side upwards.

,
Repeat until the plate is full.

,
Slowly add the 500ml water to the plate.
Place the plate with seedling starters in the plastic bag.
Place the completed "greenhouse" in its appropriate warm and light location.

Make a note on your calendar to inspect the seeds every 4 to 5 days.
Once the sprouts start forming leaves, you can remove them from the plastic bag.

Know where you're going.
Find your bus stop.
Wait in a calm and orderly manner.
When you see the bus and the bus can see you, hail the bus by putting your hand out and clearly signalling the bus.
When the bus pulls up and the doors are open, board the bus.
If you have a ticket (Metcard or Myki), validate it by inserting it into the validator (the green machine) with the blue front side pointing towards you and the white arrow pointing downwards if it is a metcard.
If you do not have a ticket, buy one from the driver.
Once you have boarded the bus, sit down if there are any seats.
To get off the bus, you must pull the cord or push the STOP button before your stop - you need to give the driver enough notice.

,
When getting off, get off in an orderly manner.
If you have a Myki remember to TOUCH OFF YOUR MYKI CARD!!!

Understand that building a pole barn is straight forward and pretty much as simple as it gets.
Build an 8 x 16-foot (2.44 X 4.88 meters) structure with a shed roof that is 8 feet (2.44 meters) high in the front and 6 feet (1.83 meters) tall in the back.
Start building the pole barn by laying out the location of the posts on the ground that drains well and is relatively flat.
Dig the post holes a minimum of 2 to 4 feet (.
Set the treated 4 x 4-inch (10.16 X 10.16 cm) wood posts into place, bracing them to keep them plumb.
Tamp down the dirt as you backfill.
Attach a treated 2 x 6-inch (5.08 x 15.24 cm) wood skirt board around the bottom of the back and sides of the pole barn if you have it open in the front.
Add another 2 x 4-inch (5.08 x 10.16 cm) grit on the side level with the one you placed against the bottom of the stringer at the back.

,
Use 2 x 6-inch (5.08 x 15.24 cm) wood for the roof rafters that sit on 4-foot (1.22-meter) centers.
Fasten metal hurricane hold-down straps to the posts and to the rafters to prevent high wind gusts from pulling the roof off of the support posts.

,
Overlap 29-gauge galvanized corrugated roofing panel by 2 inches (2.12 cm) to the skirt board, stringers and grits.
Finish with preformed foam sealer strips that fit between the roofing and joist.

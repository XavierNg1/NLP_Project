Take the 2 pre-cut fabric swatches and iron all of the wrinkles out of them so that it is easier to work with the fabric.
Place both pieces of fabric together with the right sides of fabric touching.
Use your sewing machine to sew together both sides of your 10 inch (25.4 cm) strips with a ¼ inch seam allowance.
Turn the fabric right side out by using a safety pin.
Remove the safety pin.
Tuck ¼ inch of each open end into the sleeve of fabric and iron both ends flat.

,
Pin a safety pin to each end of the pre-cut elastic.
Thread the elastic into one open end of the sleeve.
Pin a straight pin through all 3 layers, approximately ¼ inch from each open end.
Remove both safety pins and line up each end of elastic with the edges of the fabric.
Use the sewing machine to stitch both ends of the strap closed, being sure to catch the elastic into the stitches.

,
Stitch down both sides and over both ends to reinforce all stitching.
Insert one end of the completed band into the loop on the suspender clip.
Reinforce the stitches securing the suspender clip in place.

,
Stitch one piece of Velcro close to the free end of the strap.
Complete the strap by attaching the item you chose as an embellishment over the clip.

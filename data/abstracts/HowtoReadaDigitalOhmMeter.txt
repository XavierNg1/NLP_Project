Obtain a digital multimeter with ohmmeter capabilities in the range of resistance you wish to measure.
Plug two test leads into the OHM terminals.
It is possible to damage some sensitive circuits when taking an ohmmeter reading because there is a voltage from the internal battery applied to the Unit Under Test (UUT).
Turn the meter on.
To measure very high resistance (over 100,000 ohms), ensure that you are only reading the Unit Under Test.
The accuracy for any digital device is the stated accuracy plus or minus 1 digit.
To read low resistance accurately, some meters have a relative function.

Plant apple trees that are known to grow well in your area.
Opt to purchase rootstock in place of seedlings.
Plant rootstock in pots until you are ready to use it.
Ensure your rootstock and scion will be compatible in diameter.
Buy several root stocks at once.
Cut scion branches in the fall or winter.
Snip one year old branches from apple trees.
Choose scion branches that have three or more buds and are one-quarter inch (0.6cm) thick.
Opt to purchase scions instead of harvesting them yourself.
Moisten some sawdust or sphagnum moss.
Open and spray the bag with water occasionally to ensure your scions do not dry out.

,
Graft your apple trees early in the spring just before the buds of the rootstock tree are ready to open.
Choose a rootstock that is one-fourth inch (0.6cm) thick.
Plan to cut the end of the rootstock at an upward angle.
Clip off the bottom of the scion, above where the branch has died.
Sharpen your grafting knife or paring knife.
Cut the bottom of the scion at an acute angle downward.
Make a corresponding cut in the top of the rootstock.
Cut tongues in each end.
Interlock the tongues between the rootstock and the scion.
Wrap the conjoined area with floral tape or masking tape.
Paint the tape with parafilm or grafting wax.

,
Snip the scion above the top, third, bud at a 45-degree angle.
Label the scion immediately, so that you know what you have grafted.

,
Plant the rootstock in pots.
Store them in a temperature between 36 and 42 degrees Fahrenheit (2.2 to 5.5 degrees Celsius).
Plant your rootstock in a safe place where you can watch the trees carefully for signs of insects, deer or other damage.
Remove any shoots that extend from the rootstock.

Get an ordinary pencil and draw the outline of the eye hole and eyelid.
Change to a darker sketching pencil.
Then you shade the edge of the iris really dark and then 1/3 of the way down, blend it slightly so the edge goes a bit lighter.
Change back to an ordinary pencil if you used a different one and underneath the shaded part under the reflection, do part of the iris.
Shade around the pupil like you did with the outline of the inner iris in step 2, but with an ordinary pencil.
At the top, right hand side of the iris you need to shade in darkly with a normal pencil, diagonally, so it looks like the iris is going around and not just colored otherwise it won't look so realistic.
Add some eyelashes.

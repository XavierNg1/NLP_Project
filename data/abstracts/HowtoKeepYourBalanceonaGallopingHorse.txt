Practice standing up in your stirrups at a trot or canter.
Adjust the stirrups (assuming you aren't riding bareback).
Ride the horse at a walk or trot for at least ten minutes before you allow the horse to begin galloping.
Slowly pick up speed (rather than forcing the horse to go up to a gallop immediately).
Stand up in your stirrups.
Ease into a gallop.

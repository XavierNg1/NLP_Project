Keep an eye out for typically paranormal behavior in your house.
Rule out the obvious causes of "other-worldly" noises and issues first.
Take an honest appraisal of your own health and stress levels.
Ignore the alleged spirits as much as possible, not even giving them a passing thought.
Have a religious leader, medium, or psychic examine the house if you are still unsure.

Combine the chia seeds, milk, syrup, and vanilla extract in a large bowl.
Let the mixture sit for 30 minutes, then give it a stir.
Cover the bowl and leave it in the fridge overnight.This is not absolutely necessary, but many people prefer the thick, pudding-like texture that the chia seeds get by the following morning.
Distribute the mixture between two bowls.
Top it off with some sliced fruit and nuts, if desired.

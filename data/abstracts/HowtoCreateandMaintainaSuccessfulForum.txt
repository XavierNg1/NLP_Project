Decide upon a niche to target with your community.
Find some other people that are interested in building the community with you.
Decide on the theme, and find some friends that are interested in working with you on your new community, you will need to decide on a hosting plan for the forum, i.e.
Select which forum software you want to use.
Know that installation instructions will be different depending on which forum software you choose, but in most cases, you will have to download and unzip the forum software after downloading it, upload it into the publicly accessible directory of your web server via ftp, and then create a MySQL database for it (ask your hosting provider for instructions on this).
Have the forum up and running on your webspace, you can create the boards for the forum (where forum threads will be posted in).
Know that before making the forum public, it is a good idea to create maybe two or three threads in each forum area, so that visitors to the site, and new users, will have somewhere to post.

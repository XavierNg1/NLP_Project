Leave your friend alone for a while.
Be aware that giving someone time isn't always the best solution.
Call or text your friend about catching up again.
Be sincere and humble.
Listen carefully to what your friend says.
Do not appease your friend by saying "sorry" over and over again.
Do not leave issues unresolved but at the same time know when to take a break.
Try to lay low for a while if your friend is still seething and resentful.
Be open minded and willing to forgive your friend if they are in the wrong.

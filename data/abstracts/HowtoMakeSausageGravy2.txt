Add some finely minced garlic and or shallots with the sausage for a decadent, nuanced gravy.
Spice the gravy up with more than just pepper.
Use leaner ground meats, like turkey or chicken, but add butter to account for the lost fat.
Substitute a cup of diced brown mushrooms for the sausage (or with it) and cook in 2 tablespoons butter and oil for a vegetarian variation.
Throw caution into the wind with a southwest chipotle sausage gravy, complete with chorizo.

If you are starting the conversation, do not talk to them as soon as they are online, wait at least 10-15 seconds.
For the first response, take all the time you need, and make it seem like your doing something else if you're not already.
Remain cool.
See how long until they respond.
Carry on more than one conversation if possible, it will help slow down on the quickness of your responses as well.

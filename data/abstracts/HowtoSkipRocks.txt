Find a flat water surface with a large supply of rocks.
Select your rock.
Place your index finger against the edge of the rock.
Face the water sideways, with your feet shoulder-width apart.
Bend your wrist all the way back and then snap it forward to flick the rock against the surface of the water.
Get your legs into it.
Make sure to follow through.
Keep practicing.

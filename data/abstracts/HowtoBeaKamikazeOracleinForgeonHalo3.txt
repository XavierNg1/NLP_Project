Make sure you are enabled to enter editor mode (press UP on your D-Pad to enter editor mode, and again to exit editor mode back into normal player mode) as you will need to enter editor mode later on.
Collect a few plasma grenades while in player mode.
Find a tall, perfectly vertical wall and stand at the bottom of the wall looking up.

,
Throw a plasma grenade up along the wall and stand below it.
Try to make the plasma grenade land on you - basically you are trying to stick yourself with your own grenade, so you will need to anticipate where it will land.
Enter editor mode as soon as the grenade sticks to you.
Find another player, preferably an enemy in order to maximize the damage you will cause.
Move in close to the intended victim and press UP on your D-Pad to re-enter player mode.

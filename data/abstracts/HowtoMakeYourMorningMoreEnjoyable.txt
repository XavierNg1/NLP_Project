Get ready the night before!,
Get a early night sleep.
If you have a tendency to hit the snooze button, don't!,
Try to shower at night.
If you have trouble picking out outfits to wear, try to stick to easy to match clothing items.
Eat breakfast!,
Keep your routines to a minimal.
Turn on some music!,
If you still find yourself rushing out the door, wake up five minutes earlier.
Make a morning routine schedule.

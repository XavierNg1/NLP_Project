Start by drawing a large circle using a compass.
Make a dot at the top of your circle with the pencil.
Turn your compass to make a pencil mark that crosses your circle on the left.
Move your point to one of the marks without changing the radius of the compass.
Continue moving your compass point to the new marks and drawing marks until you have a total of 6 marks that are equidistant.
Use a ruler to create a triangle that starts from the top mark on the edge of the circle.
Create a second triangle starting with the mark at the base of your circle.
Erase the circle.

Lay two sections of 12 inch (30.5 cm) diameter PVC drain pipe parallel on a flat, level surface, with the ends capped and sealed to keep water out.
Cut 8 foot (2.4 m) long 2X4 treated pine boards 7 foot (2.1 m) 9 inches (22.9 cm) long, and lay them out down the length of your pipe on 24 inch (61.0 cm) centers.

,
Nail a band across the ends of these "joists", using a 2X4 treated board 16 feet (4.9 m) long on each side.
Using self-drilling, coarse thread, 2 1⁄2 inch (6.4 cm), hex-head "tech" screws, attach a 21 inch (53.3 cm) block of treated 2X4 laid flat between each of your joists to nail the joists to.
Toenail, or screw the joists to these blocking.

,
Lay a 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide, 16 gauge galvanized strap diagonally across the top of your deck boards from corner to corner each direction.
Measure the deck across opposite corners and rack it until the measurements are equal at each diagonal.

,
Fasten the strapping to each joist, either by drilling the strapping and nailing with 16d (3 1/2 inch) hot dipped galvanized nails, or screwing with the tech screws used for securing your blocking.

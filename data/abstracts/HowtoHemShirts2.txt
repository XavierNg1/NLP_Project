Figure out how short you want your shirt to be, and make a mark on the outside of the shirt.
Use a dressmaker's chalk or pen to draw a line all around the shirt at an even distance from the bottom edge.
Fold the hem up until the bottom edge touches the line that you drew.
Sew around shirt, as close to the selvage edge as you can.
Fold hem back down, and tuck the excess fabric inside the shirt, away from the bottom of the hem.
Press the hem with an iron.
Top stitch as close to your seam as possible.
Turn the shirt inside-out and cut the excess material away.
Turn shirt right-side-out.

Remember that chihuahuas are delicate and fragile!,
Don't play 'dress-up'.
Give it some downtime before you try to teach him anything.
Let her know who is the alpha in the household (and it shouldn't be her).
If your chihuahua has any bad behavior, correct it immediately!,
Make a safe spot where your chihuahua can go to have some private time or where it can go when it is scared or feels angry or threatened.
Take your chihuahua outside to do its personal business about the same time every day.
Give your chihuahua treat/s and praise when it does something that you want it to.

Survey the land for signs of dried out river beds.
Dig a few curved holes (the more the better) about 19 inches (50 cm) deep so that the moist subsoil is clearly visible.
Throw any plants into the hole/holes.

,
Place an open coffee can, mug, cup or canteen in the center of each hole.
Lay a taut piece of clear plastic wrap across the top of each hole.

,
Create a seal by pouring sand in a circle around each hole along the outside of the plastic wrap.
Place a small to medium sized rock in the center of the plastic wrap so that the plastic wrap dips to a point above the can.
Wait for the sun to evaporate water out of the moist soil and any plants within each hole.
Once the sun dries the subsoil in a hole, just dig another.

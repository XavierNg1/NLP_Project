Find a replacement battery.



 

The battery pack contains two to four AA NiCd cells connected in series.
Remove the insulation from the tab (found at one end) and fold the tabs at both ends back over themselves.
To open the ER203, move the depth adjustment to the shortest cut position, remove the comb guide and the clipper head.
Once the screws are out, you can pop off the back of the clipper.
Remove the old battery.
Insert the new battery with the end of the battery that has a groove/crimp toward the clipper end of the shaver.
Reassemble.
Plug in.

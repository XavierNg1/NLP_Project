See a doctor.The first thing to do when you want to quit alcohol is to seek medical care.
Get examined.Medical staff might monitor your physical state by checking your heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature.
Slowly reduce alcohol intake.In some cases, instead of quitting “cold turkey,” the best way to prevent serious withdrawal is to slowly decrease the amount of alcohol you consume over a longer period of time.
Take appropriate medicine.Depending on the type and severity of your symptoms, you may need to take certain medications.
Prevent night sweats.Take care of your night sweats by sleeping in cotton sheets.

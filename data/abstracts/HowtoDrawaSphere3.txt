Collect the materials you will need to help you draw a sphere.
Set up your spherical object as a model.Place it on the table or desk in front of where you are sitting, and be sure that a light source is hitting it from one side.
Draw a picture plane around the edges of your paper.This is a simply a border that sits about 1 centimeter in from the edges of your paper.
Sketch the boundaries of the sphere.
Indicate the horizontal and vertical axes within the boundaries.
Compare the width and your height of your axes.
Draw the contour of the sphere using the boundaries you made in Step 4.
Sketch transitions from one plane line to the next to make curves.
Clean up the edges of your contour with your eraser.Once you have made all of the contour lines on your circle, you need to clean up and thin down your circle.
Decide where you want your light source to be.
Draw a curved line on the opposite side of the circle from the light source.
Erase the horizontal and vertical axes after you draw the curved line.
Shade in the occlusion shadow.This is the small shadow just below the sphere; in the previous methods, we called it the core shadow.
Fill in the form shadow.
Continue shading from dark to light, working your way from bottom to top.You will have a highlight spot where your light source is, so as you work your way to the top, remember to leave a spot untouched.
Leave the highlight spot near the light source on the sphere.
Blend in the shading so that the tones merge together.

Make sure your teen really wants an exchange student for a year.
Make sure your teens have some contact and familiarity with the student.
Remind your teen that the student is probably tired from the flight and very nervous to be staying with a family of strangers.
Expect some conflict between your teen(s) and the exchange student, especially at first.
Don't let your own teen feel new baby syndrome.

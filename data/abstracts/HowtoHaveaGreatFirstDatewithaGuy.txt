First, be casual.
Don't wear that short skirt with the see-through top that is cut backless.
Enjoy the moment, and concentrate on having fun and enjoying your time getting to know this new person.
Relax and be yourself.
Put your best foot forward like it is a job interview.
Do something a little crazy, a little wild, and a little unexpected, but not too crazy!

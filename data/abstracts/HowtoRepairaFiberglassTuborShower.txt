Purchase a suitable kit for your shower (or bathtub).
Clean the area to be repaired.
Determine if the damaged area will require fiberglass cloth reinforcing.
Read the mixing and tinting instructions of the product you have purchased.
Place a protective material like cardboard or heavy construction paper on the surface you will mix the material on.
Measure the amount of polyester resin into the mixing container you think you will need for your repair.
Add the colorant from the correct tube that came with the kit.
Mix thickening material into the resin/colorant mixture until it is a desired consistency for your patch.
Add the hardener according to the kit's instructions.
Mix the repair material thoroughly.
Using a flat tool like a putty knife or wooden tongue depressor, scoop out some of the mixture and apply it to the damaged area.
Sand the patch carefully, trying not to scuff the adjacent areas.
Mix another batch of resin and colorant to overlay the first patch, without the thickening agent.
Buff the finished repair with the buffing compound provided in the kit to restore the gloss finish so it matches the original.

Clean up the area, and admire your handiwork.

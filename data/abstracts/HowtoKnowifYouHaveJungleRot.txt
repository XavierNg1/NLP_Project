Look for irritation at the site of a small wound.Jungle rot makes its home in wounds you already received.
Check for an ulcer.An ulcer is a serious sore or lesion accompanied by a breakdown of nearby tissue.
Recognize when you feel pain.The first two to three weeks of jungle rot are the most painful.
Check for a foul smell.When the pustules burst, they exude a stinky mixture of blood and pus.
Look out for tetanus.Tetanus — also known as lockjaw — is a serious bacterial disease that affects the nervous system.
Check for ruptured tendons.The Achilles tendon — a tendon connecting your heel to the muscles in your calf — is often at special risk for rupture if you have jungle rot.
Look for gangrene.As the tropical ulcer progresses, it might lead to gangrene, a medical condition characterized by the death of tissue due to infection.
Look for edema.Edema is buildup of bodily fluid that causes the skin to swell and become discolored.If you notice yourself accumulating weight in your legs or feet, experiencing stiffness in your joints, or feeling aches and pains in your legs, you probably have edema.
Look for hyperpigmentation.Hyperpigmentation is the darkening of skin in uneven patches.You might notice the skin around your ulcer becomes discolored and darker than the rest of the surrounding skin.
Use caution when traveling to tropical regions.As their name implies, tropical ulcers are found in the hot, tropical regions of the world.
Stay out of mud and puddles.The bacteria that cause tropical ulcers thrive in dirty water.
Treat wounds immediately.
Protect your legs and feet.Walking barefoot puts you at higher risk for tropical ulcers, since the bacteria that cause it usually invade through wounds in your legs or feet.

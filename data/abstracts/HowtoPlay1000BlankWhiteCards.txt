Everyone draws a hand of five cards.
On your turn, draw another card, then play a card.
When you play a card on someone, it takes effect immediately.
If you have any blank cards in your hand, you should make them into non-blank cards.
Most cards must have a title, an effect, and an illustration.
When there are no more cards in the deck, just keep playing.
At the end of the game, you usually tally the point values of each player's cards in play, and the person with the most points wins.

At the end of each game, divide the deck (which should now be full of cards) between the players.
Take the deck of good cards (the 'seed deck') you came out with last time to your next game.

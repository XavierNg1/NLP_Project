Note that an organic reaction occurs in one of two ways.
Observe organic reactions using a special spectroscopic technique.
Understand that reactions that proceed in a step-like manner are usually not specific.
Do kinetic measurements of a reaction rate to determine the rate of a reaction.
Apply the study of molecular dynamics of chemical reactions to any investigation of the mechanisms behind reactions.
Be aware that organic compounds usually have thermodynamic stability that is remarkable when compared to compounds of other atoms such as carbon.
Learn about the two main common intermediates encountered in many organic reactions.
Study examples.
Understand the utility of theoretical modeling of chemical transformations.

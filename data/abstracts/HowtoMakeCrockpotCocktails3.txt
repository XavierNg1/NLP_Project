Give yourself at least 1 to 2 hours to prepare the apple martinis.
Pour the apple cider into a large crockpot, then add the cinnamon sticks.
Cover the crockpot, and cook the two together over high heat for 1 to 2 hours.
Turn the heat down to warm, then stir in the vanilla-flavored vodka.
Mix together some sugar and cinnamon in a shallow bowl.
Wet the rims of your martini glasses with lemon juice, then dip them into the cinnamon-sugar.
Pour some caramel sauce into the bottom of each glass, then ladle the apple martini into them.If this is for a party, consider leaving the martini in the crockpot, and just filling the glasses with caramel sauce.
Garnish the martinis, if desired, before serving them.

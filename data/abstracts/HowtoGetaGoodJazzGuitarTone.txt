Turn off your effects, set all your EQ knobs to the middle, and set your amp to a clean channel (if you have one).
Set your guitar's controls.
Play your guitar a bit and listen.
If you're too dirty, turn down the gain and low/bass frequencies.
If you sound too bright, roll down your guitar's tone and your amps high/treble frequencies.
If it sounds dull or weak, try adding a hint of reverb at the amp or with a pedal.

Select the auto choosing function where the scanner decides whether to scan in black and white, grayscale or color.
You have a book with a lot of images, try doing the scanning in the usual way.
You are exasperated with the progress you are making, try this space efficient method: scan a good portion of the book, about one-third, in black and white.
Go thru the 100 scans and delete all pages with images.
Scan, again, but in grayscale the first 100 pages of the book.
Go thru the second batch of scans and delete all the pages that have just text.

,
Combine the 1) black and white and 2) grayscale folders.
Before scanning the next batch (pages 101 to 200), check the first batch for errors.
Sometimes the long way of doing things is faster, maybe give this method a try if you are space conscious.

If space is not a problem, another option would be to scan the whole book in grayscale.

Find a well-used ashtray full of cold ashes.This sounds gross, but cigarette ashes are actually a great way to lift old hair dye stains off your skin.
Mix the ashes in a bowl with warm water.
Apply the mixture in a thin layer to the stained area on your face.
Wash the mixture off your face with warm water.
Finished.

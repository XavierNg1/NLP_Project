Find the largest power of 2 that's closest to the number you're trying to decompose, which will eventually be the smaller number in your multiplication problem.
Subtract this power from the number you're decomposing.
Find the largest power of two that's closest to the difference you just found, and subtract it from the difference.
Keep repeating this until your number is reduced to zero.

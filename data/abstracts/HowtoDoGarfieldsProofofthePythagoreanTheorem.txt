Construct a right triangle resting on side b with right angle to the left connected to upright and perpendicular side a, with side c connecting the endpoints of a and b.

Construct a similar triangle with side b now extending in a straight line from the original side a, then with side a parallel along the top to the bottom original side b, and side c connecting the endpoints of the new a and b.

,
Understand the goal.
Transfer your angle knowledge to the upper new triangle.
Look at the whole figure as a trapezoid in two ways.
Look at the interior of the trapezoid and add up the areas, in order to set them equal to the formula just found.
Set the two Area formulas equal.
Now expand the left hand square, which becomes a^2 + 2ab + b^2, and we see we can subtract 2ab from both sides of a^2 + 2ab + b^2, = 2ab + c^2.
Finished!

Train your teams well.
,When you first create your team, make sure that you find players who you know for a fact want to achieve something more than just being some pub all-stars, because if not, you will go nowhere.
Understand that competitive gaming, and especially wanting to go pro, is the equivalent of a full-time job.
Recruit effectively.
Recruit mentally fit players, because physical skill will be improving constantly as they learn more about the game.
Schedule your team.Train your team, meaning train your team's work ethic,
When your team of four is finally set, the first job that you will have is to go map out spawn points.
Go back over all the maps that you have just gone over, and create your own unique call-outs for each of these maps together as a team.
Train your teams about set-ups; how you are going to set-up on each map and each game-type per that map.CTF,
You need at least two set-ups and transitions for both sides of each competitive map.Search and Destroy,
You will need at least three strategies for offense and two for defense.Simulation,
Now defense for SND may apply for defense in demo.
Positioning and angling is yet another important point for playing RPG, and for playing any shooter game for that matter.
Angling is the next important thing.
Lets discuss spawn traps.

Understanding the mini-map.
By having this information in real-time, you can now accordingly fill-in wherever a teammate isn't.
We will now talk about pre-nades.
I would like to now talk about stun checks(flashes just take too long to throw, which renders them ineffective for this tactic).
Now we'll talk about quick shots or ODB shots.
Now we'll go into route times.
The mental game.
This is not and never will be the appropriate way to act.
You must train yourself to remain calm and collected.

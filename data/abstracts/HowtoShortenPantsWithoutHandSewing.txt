If the pants have an unfinished bottom, you are on your way.

Turn the pants back to the right side.

Measure the length and make a chalk mark on the new pants.

Leave an inch and a half more than the mark and cut the rest off.
Take the wonderweb, a glue that melts, and sew with a sewing machine on the inside around the bottom of the pants.

Lay the leg of the pants flat on your table.

Use a steam iron and a cloth to press the bottom of the pants with plenty of steam.

Do the same to the other leg.

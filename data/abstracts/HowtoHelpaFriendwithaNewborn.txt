Ask your friend if there is anything specifically you can do to help.
It might seem like a kind gesture to just turn up out of the blue with a week's worth of homemade frozen meals for your friend and a tonne of nappies (diapers), but, you might knock on the door just as the baby has finally fallen asleep after four hours continuous screaming, your friend might already have a jammed packed freezer or, they may just be enjoying being all alone with baby bonding.

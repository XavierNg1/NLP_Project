Inspect the walls.
Inspect baseboard molding.
Determine if any dimples or bumps in the wall are aligned directly above each other - including those that were found on the baseboard molding.
Accurately measure the distance between the vertical rows of the nail / screw heads found above.
The measurement found between will repeat.
Locate a stud by finding an electrical outlet, preferably one not in close proximity to corners, doorways or windows.

,
Remove the wall plate from the outlet.

,
If the stud is not visible, carefully probe against the outside the box (to the left and right) with a very thin screwdriver or awl (a short, straight piece of coat hanger cut at a 45 degree angle works very well; bend it at a 90 degree angle to hold comfortably).
Probing at a light switch, since they are generally at doorways, will not provide an accurate indication of where additional studs may be - as mentioned above.
Project the stud closest to the desired location for the support of the shelf, picture, etc.
If no evidence found, carefully probe directly above the baseboard where is meets the wallboard.
Once found, continue to probe to determine the leading and trailing edge of the stud.
Project the center of the stud vertically to the height desired.
Once satisfied, install the support fastener.

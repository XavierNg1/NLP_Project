First of all, you are going to need a parent or other legal guardian to help you to buy materials and assist in major projects.
The first thing you notice when you come into a room is its wall color.
After you have painted your walls, it is important to have something to hang on them.
Now you have your walls down, work on furniture , add stuff to your room that is inexpensive and you and your friends can use- for example chairs,a table, lamps.....Stuff that a normal guy would have in their room, but make sure you have a theme going with paint on your walls.

Evaluate your diet

Increasing your daily intake of dairy products is an obvious source of more calcium, but you can also add green leafy vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, collards, kale and Swiss chard, which are also great calcium-rich foods.
Choose the fortified option


Many foods such as fruit juices and cereals are being offered in calcium fortified varieties.
Step up the exercise


Exercise, especially weight-bearing exercise such as walking, is shown to help the body retain more calcium, because the body is being forced to hold itself up.
Increase your vitamin D intake


Vitamin D goes hand-in-hand with calcium absorption.
Add a calcium supplement


If your diet alone isn't providing you with approximately 1,000 milligrams, you will need to add a calcium dietary supplement to make up for the deficiency.
Stay within a reasonable daily calcium intake


While too little calcium can lead to bone loss and weak teeth, too much calcium can lead to a different set of health problems.

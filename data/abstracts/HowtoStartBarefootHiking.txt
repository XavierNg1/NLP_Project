Spend some time in your front or backyard barefoot.
Try to interpret the new sensations as just that: new sensations.
Always step straight down.
Always watch the path ahead.
Keep your weight on the balls of your feet and not on your heels.
Develop habits of awareness.
Select a short trail with a variety of surfaces for your first barefoot hike.
Continue short hikes about once or twice a week.

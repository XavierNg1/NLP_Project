Help them use visual/picture schedules.
Give them choice and topic boards.Like picture schedules, these are boards with pictures that represent a variety of choices within a given activity or time-frame.
Spend time with them.
Help them with homework.
Get along with them.Autistic children normally do awkward things, like failing to respond to a "hello" or saying that their clothes look strange, without realizing that it's rude.
Be there for them.

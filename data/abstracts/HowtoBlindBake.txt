Select your pie dish.
Place your freshly prepared pastry in the pie dish according to the recipe's instructions.
Chill the pastry base for half an hour in the freezer to firm it.
Dock the dough by piercing the base with a fork in several places to allow airflow and prevent bubbles.
Place one of the following over the pastry base, cutting the covering wide enough to make sure it covers the edges as well:









Baking paper (parchment) or greaseproof (wax) paper TIP: ‘Scrunch’ the paper up a few times before using – this makes it more pliable and able to mold into the bottom angle (and sides of a fluted tin).
Place dried beans, dry rice, dry lentils or pie weights on top of the covering.
Place the pie dish in an oven at the temperature and for the length of time suggested by the recipe.
Remove the dish from the oven and allow the pastry to cool for 3-5 minutes.
Add filling and bake the pie for the time recommended by your recipe.
Finished.

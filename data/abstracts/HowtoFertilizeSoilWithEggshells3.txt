Crack open a raw egg and remove the yolk and white.
Clean the shell, inside and out, using warm water, then set it down in the sun the dry.
Consider poking a small drainage hole in the bottom of the shell using a pin or thumb tack.
Fill the eggshell with damp, seed-starting soil.If you are having trouble getting the soil into the eggshell, roll up a piece of paper into a cone, and use it to funnel the soil into the shell instead.You can also use a small spoon instead.

,
Sprinkle 2 to 3 seeds on top and lightly cover them with more soil.Smaller plants, such as flowers and herbs, work best when starting in eggshells.
Place the egg in a holder and place it on a sunny windowsill where it won't be disturbed.
Water the seeds, and wait for them to grow.
Transplant the eggshell outside when the seedling has 1 to 2 sets of true leaves.
Finished.

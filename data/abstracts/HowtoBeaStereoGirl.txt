Love music!,
Mosh in the mosh pit, in your bedroom or even in front of the school.
Be very confident in yourself and everything you do.
Live for your livejournal.
Wear up to three belts at a time around your hips but not attached to the belt loops on your pants.
Wear Converse Chuck Taylors or slip-ons, Classic Vans, Air Force Ones, and Bathing Ape shoes.
Have lots of rocker friends as well as skater, punk, emo, goth and few preppy friends.
Wear mini skirts over pants and shorts over leggings.
The in-crowd is overrated.
Get good grades and pay attention in class.
Wear lots of head bands, ribbons, and bandannas and beanies.

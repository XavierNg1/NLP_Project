Choose the right fish.
Select the feeding place.
Start slowly.
Move your hand closer to the fish as they feed.
Try food in your hand once you feel certain that the fish are used to your presence and your hand.
Set your hand into the water, and donâ€™t make fast movements or the fish won't take the food.
Continue the feeding by hand regularly.

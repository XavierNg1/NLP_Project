The most cost effective first step is to buy an amplifier wiring kit off of an internet auction site, etc.
Run the 12v power wire (usually the longest wire in the kit, mostly red, typically ranges from 8 gauge to 0 gauge) from the battery through the firewall and then to the amp.
Find a solid metal ground somewhere near the amplifier.
Pull the aftermarket CD player out of the dash.
Take your remote wire that came in your amp kit and splice/solder it onto that blue and white-striped wire and run it through the dash and then along the door jam.

,
While you have the CD player removed, plug the RCA white and red plugs into the back of the deck where it says "Subwoofer Output.",
Run all the wires straight back to the amplifier.you should run the power and remote control down the right as factory speaker wires run down the left due to fire risks if the power cable shorts out and you have your speaker cables down the same side it will blow your head deck (cd player).
Use Speaker Wire to connect sub-woofers to amplifier.
Hopefully by now you have a subwoofer box/enclosure.
Be sure to know the impedance of the subwoofer(s) you are using and try to match the amplifier's impedance accordingly.
Put a fuse into 12v wire in the engine bay no more than 0.5m away from battery.
Connect the power wire to your battery.
Lastly, connect the battery cable to the amplifier.
Do not turn up the volume or gain too high or you may produce clipping in the subwoofers.

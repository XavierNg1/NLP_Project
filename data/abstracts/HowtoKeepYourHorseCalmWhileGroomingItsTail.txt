Form a bond with your horse.
Pat your horse's head, then slowly move down his neck and sides.
Talk softly to your horse as you get closer to his rear.
Stand to the horse's side and touch his dock (the base of his tail) with one hand.
When you are finished grooming, give your horse a gentle pat on his rump and tell him how good he was.

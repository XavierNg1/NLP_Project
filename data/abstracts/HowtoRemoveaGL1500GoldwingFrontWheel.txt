First thing is to get a jack ready for the Goldwing, make sure it's a sturdy jack.
Pull the upper side mudguard/fender trim off as in the first picture below (right side shown).
Remove the 8mm bolt from the top of the rotor cover and bracket and remove the rotor cover as shown below.
Remove the two Allen bolts holding the brake calipers in place and slide the calipers off the brake disc as shown in the next three pictures.

,
Now remove the 22mm bolt from the right-side of the axle, as in the first picture.
With the Goldwing jacked up, push the axle out with a drift from the right side, then pull it fully out to the left as shown in the two pictures below.

,
Pull the speedo drive away as you roll the wheel out as in the picture.
On the right side, note the spacer that sits in the middle of the wheel shown in the picture.
When refitting the wheel, note the points I made about the spacer and the speedo drive.

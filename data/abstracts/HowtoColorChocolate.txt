Decide if you are going to use dark chocolate or white chocolate.
Buy oil based coloring that is made especially to color chocolate.
Get vegetable shortening, not vegetable oil.
Melt the chocolate in a double boiler, if possible.
Melt the chocolate in a glass bowl if you use the microwave.
Work in small batches.
Place the white chocolate chips in a glass bowl.
Stir the chocolate as you microwave it for intervals of 30 seconds.
Check the consistency of the melted chocolate.
Place a deep pot with a handle on the stove.
Take a metal bowl and set it on the pot with water.
Stir the chips as they start to melt.
Check the consistency of the chocolate once it has melted.
Take the chocolate off the heat and place the bowl next to the oil or powder colors.
Sprinkle the powder color directly into the chocolate.
Stir the chocolate to blend in the color.
Place the bowl back on the double broiler if the chocolate starts to harden.
Warm the coloring oil before you put it in the chocolate.
Place the tightly sealed coloring oil in a small zip lock bag.
Place the plastic bagged bottle in a bowl with warm water for 10-15 minutes.
Remove the oil from the plastic bag.
Slowly add a few drops of oil to the warmed chocolate and stir.
Work on one color at a time.

Do not go overboard buying hydroponics supplies that they may need in the future but will not need in the beginning stages of hydroponic gardening.
Create a dedicated area for their gardening.
Get the right hydroponic supplies.
Choose the seed you want to grow.
Take wet paper towels and place the seed(s) inside them.
Put the bag in a warm, dark place and give the seeds some time to germinate.
Keep in mind that, when the seeds have germinated and is showing at least one inch of stem, it is a seedling.
Watch the seedling(s) carefully so that they grow straight.
Move your plant into its permanent container when the seedling is stronger and bigger.

,
Fill the container with water.
Place your grown seedling into the water, so that only the roots are submerged.
Change the water every few days, especially if it seems to get murky or translucent.
If you chose a plant that bears fruit, watch for flower buds growing near the leaves.
Make sure that the flowers don't weigh the stem down, if you chose a flowering plant.
Harvest the fruit/vegetables like any other plant.

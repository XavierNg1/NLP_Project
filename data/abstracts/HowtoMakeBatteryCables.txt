Lift the hood and check the battery, as well as all connected lines and cables, for rust, corrosion or bad connections.
Ensure you have the same gauges of terminals, terminal lugs, and cables.
Pick up the appropriate cable for your machine, in the gauge size determined above.
Purchase a non-acidic or active flux core roll of solder wire.
Grab some rosin flux paste of fluid for the connections, again ignoring acid or active flux pastes.
Alternatively, use the bad cables to purchase replacement parts from your local auto shop or hardware store.
Use a thick pair of cable cutters to smoothly clip the cables.
Cut away the final 1" or so of rubber housing to expose the cable.
Using your fingers, lightly pull off any loose or unwound strands from the cables before using.
Add two pieces of 4-5" shrink tubing to each cable, shuffling it out of the way until later.
Liberally apply flux paste to the inside of the terminals and the exposed cables.
Slide the terminal lug onto the expose cable end, pushing it as far on as you can.
Crimp the terminal lug onto the cable using a flat nail punch or a crimper.
Using a flame or other high-heat source (such as from a butane torch), heat the lug until the rosin flux is boiling.
Still applying heat, solder around the connection between cable and terminal lug.
Slide the shrink tubing back up to cover the expose metal, then use the heat source to shrink it around the connection.
Clamp the terminals in a vice, open side up.
Liberally swab the inside of the terminal and the outside of the cable with rosin flux.
Using your torch, heat the terminal so that the rosin flux is boiling.
Preheat the end of the cable for 12-15 seconds, then push it into the terminal.
Solder the connection between terminal and wire.
Use some wire cutters to clean up any exposed strands of wiring.
Slide the sheathing to cover exposed metal, then heat it to shrink it on.

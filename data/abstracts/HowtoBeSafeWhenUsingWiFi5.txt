Encrypting important private files and folders is a great method of keeping them from prying eyes that may have been able to access your machine through a Wi-Fi network.
On Windows, right-click the file or folder you want to encrypt, select “Properties” from the context menu.
On Mac OS X, you can encrypt files by creating a virtual password-protected drive to store sensitive files and folders.

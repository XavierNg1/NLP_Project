Make sure there really are no chances.
Acknowledge your own sense of embarrassment or discomfort about the situation but don't let this deflect you from your mission of telling it like it is.
Once you've tackled your own feelings, quell any desire to laugh off your crush.
Be concrete about how you feel.
Stay open with one another.
Avoid the guilt trip.

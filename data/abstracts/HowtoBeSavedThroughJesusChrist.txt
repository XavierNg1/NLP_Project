Leave everybody out of it; itâ€™s between you and God.
Realize that you are a sinner.
Repent from sins, and change your mind about going your old ways.
Find a Church that baptizes in the authority of Jesus' Name by His instructions in Matthew 28:19.
Be glad, and rejoice, now that you have been forgiven (because when you ask for His forgiveness, He forgives).
Stay connected with God.
Remember these verses.
When you need help ask Jesus and expect Him to keep His promises.

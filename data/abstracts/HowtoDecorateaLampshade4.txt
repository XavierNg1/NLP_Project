Consider painting your lampshade a solid color first.
Choose your stencil.
Place your stencil against the lampshade and tape it in place, if necessary.
Pour some paint out onto a paper plate or palette.
Dab the paint onto the stencil.
Allow the paint to dry before applying the second layer, if necessary.
Pull the stencil off while the paint is still wet.Use both hands to pull the stencil off upwards so that you do not smudge the wet paint.
Allow the paint to dry before applying the stencil to another area.If you want to apply more designs to your lampshade, then wait until the paint is dry to the touch; this will usually take about 20 minutes for most brand of paint.
Touch the designs up using a thin brush, if necessary.
Let the lampshade dry completely before using it.

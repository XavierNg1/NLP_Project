In secret, ask the girl's parents if they consent to you being married to their daughter.
If the parents say yes, ask the girl out on a date at a very fancy diner, like the ones who have a dress code.
2 weeks before you have the date, definitely get the most beautiful, most affordable, and most her-personality ring you can, in a nice little black satin box with silk stuffed neatly inside it.
When your date is done, when you walk her home, in front of the house, kneel down.
Then, of course, there's always the awkward moment after you ask her.

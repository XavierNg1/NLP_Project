Stay out of the “fast lane.” Drivers in the “fast lane” (the left-most lane on U.S. multi-lane highways) are more likely to be ticketed not only because they’re typically driving faster, but also because of the psychological element: they appear to be going faster simply because they’re in the “fast lane”.
Go with the flow of traffic.
Pay attention to clues from other motorists, especially truckers.

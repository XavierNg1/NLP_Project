Search the trees nearby and begin collecting wood from it.
Place the crafting table somewhere close to you, right-click it and create a wooden axe.
2 logs should be enough, only use 1 out of the 2 logs you collected for wood planks.
Your home should be small, you don't want to spend too long on something that isn't a permanent shelter.
If you still have enough time, go out and collect more wood (more sticks and planks), stone (upgrade all your tools to stone), and coal (more torches).
Check frequently from time to time to see if the night had ended (alternatively, you may leave one block open so you don't have to do this, however, it's a little risky).
Look around for tall grass, destroy it to get seeds to grow wheat farms.
Go out on a journey to find sheep.
You may want to think about a tree farm as well, just to prepare, destroy leaf blocks for a chance of a sapling dropping from it.
You have a constant supply of wood, stone, food and the ability to sleep when it's night.

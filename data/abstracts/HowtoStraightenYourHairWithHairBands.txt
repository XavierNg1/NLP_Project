Wash you hair the night before.
After showering, do not blow dry hair.

Separate your hair into 2-4 equal sections.
Start with one section.
Repeat the last step on all of the sections.
Go to sleep.
Get up early in the morning if you have to do some extra styling.
If needed, add some hairspray or anti-frizz.
Enjoy your straight hair!

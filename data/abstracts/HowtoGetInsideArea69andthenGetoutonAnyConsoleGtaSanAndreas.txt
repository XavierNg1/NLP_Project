Meet Barbara Schternvart in order to get out of the base.
Type the cheat code for 'No Cops' so when you go into the restricted area, you won't be searched by the FBI/Army.
Make your way to Fort Carson.
Get the bike and go on the road past the Lil' Probe Inn and towards the base.
Go on this dirt road until you reach the fence at the base.
Go towards the other side, and at the South-East corner is a small mount with a vent on top.
When you're inside the base, use an 'Infinite Health' cheat code.
Then when you finished visiting inside Area 69, the only way to get out is NOT TO kill yourself but to get BUSTED!,
Deactivate the 'No Cops' cheat code by using it again:


Xbox: B, Right, B, Right, Left, X, A, Up
PS2: O, Right, O, Right, Left, Square, Triangle, Up
PC: AEZAKMI

,
After deactivating the cheat code, you'll see that you have a wanted level of 5 stars.
Then, enjoy using the Minigun!

Participate fully in any muster drill.
Seek out all fire/emergency information available on the ship for passengers, such as pamphlets, brochures, or maps.
Walk the routes from your cabin door to fire exits, or other access to open air.
Pack a flashlight or two with extra batteries in your luggage, in case the shipâ€™s interior lights are not working during a fire and your room and corridor are dark.
Consider the fact if a large amount of smoke is present in the hallway when you open your cabin door, you will have to crawl on the floor because smoke rises, and there should be better air quality at floor level.
If no instruction has been given about where to go during an emergency for leaving the ship, inquire about how you can learn this information.
Pack some food in your luggage that does not need to be refrigerated.
Maintain calm by doing whatever coping activities you have learned which reduce your stress, such as deep breathing (if the air is clean) stretching, holding a positive attitude, being observant, listening rather than talking, and not panicking.

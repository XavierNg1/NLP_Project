Get a cribbage board (including pegs) and a standard deck of 52 cards.
Pick a dealer and deal the hand.
Form the "crib.",
Flip the up-card or starter card.
Start counting.
Start "pegging.",
Continue until a player cannot lay down another card without exceeding 31.
Count up the cards to get your final score.
Consider the "Muggins" variation.
Play until one person reaches 121.
Don't start off with a 5.
Think about what you put into the crib.
Avoid landing on 21.
If you're close to winning, don't worry about the crib.

Pour a small amount of paint onto paper or styrofoam trays or plates.
Add a little water to the paint, if necessary.
Quickly dip the sponge into the paint, covering the entire bottom.
Hold the sponge over the tray for a few seconds to allow excess paint to drip off.
Firmly press the sponge onto the surface.
Demonstrate this process to your kids.

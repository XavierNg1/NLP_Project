Crop the watermark from your photo using your usual photo editor if the watermark is positioned at the very top, bottom, side, or corner of the photo.
Search for an unwatermarked version of your photo at Google Images.
Consider searching for similar photos that lack watermarks on free photo sites such as Flickr and FreeImages.

Write a letter to each reporting credit bureau.
Mail the letter using certified mail, “return receipt requested.” Use certified mail so that you have a time frame of when the mail was sent and which documents were sent.
Wait about 45 days before making inquiries into the status of your dispute.
Wait for a verdict in the investigation.
If applicable, ask the credit reporting agency to send notices of your revised credit report to any person or institution that received your credit report in the last six months.
If you do not receive a response to your inquiry within 45 days or the incorrect item remains on your credit report, send another certified letter.
Ask that a statement regarding the dispute be included in future reports if the investigation does not resolve the dispute.

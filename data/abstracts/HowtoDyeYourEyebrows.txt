Go a shade darker to add definition and make brows appear fuller.

Be aware of the risks.
Wash your face with facial cleanser or soap.
Outline your brow with a generous amount of petroleum jelly or balm.
Prepare the eyebrow dye according to the directions on the package.
Apply the eyebrow dye by spreading a thick layer over your brow.
Wait for three minutes, cleaning up the dye with a pointed cotton swab.

Check your eyebrows in the mirror to see if you missed any spots.

Don't stress out if the color isn't exactly what you wanted.

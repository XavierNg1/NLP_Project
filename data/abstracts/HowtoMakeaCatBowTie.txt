Cut out the felt.
Fold in the two long ends of the felt, so that they meet in the middle.

,
Fold the short ends in.
Cut out a strip of felt.
Pinch the middle of the bow tie, and wrap the felt strip in the center.
Measure your cat's neck.
Bring the two ends together to form a circle.
Alternatively, skip making a ribbon or felt collar and buy a real collar instead.

,
Use a bit of fabric glue or hot glue the back of the bow tie where it is to adhere to the collar.

,
Before the glue dries, place the bow tie onto the desired spot on the cat's collar.
Congratulations!

First of all, nothing is difficult.
Now sit in an empty room, preferably enlightened.
Now look at the page.
If you have been having an annoying friend who is giving you a bad time since a while, and you don't want to say anything to him or her just so that you don't ruin the friendship, then here's what to do.
If social networking websites are taking up too much of your time, and you are always stressed about your profile and your comments and pictures, you can always do one thing.
Are you having arguments with a family member for a long while, and you just can't take it anymore?,
Say things you've never had the courage to say.
But on the other hand, dedicate time also to your work.
This way, keep looking for better solutions and solve stress out.
You are great.

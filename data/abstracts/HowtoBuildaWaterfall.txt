Start excavating your foundation if you need to.
Measure out and cut both underlayment and rubber liner.
Set up your lower basin.
Start from the bottom up, placing larger boulders first.
Use larger stones near each waterfall if possible.
Periodically step back from your waterfall and look at the piece from a different angle.
Place the spillway rocks carefully.
Use mortar to stabilize any larger stones.
Force smaller stones and gravel beneath all sides and spillways to keep water from seeping through.
Foam in between any small cracks and crevasses using a specially-made dark foam sealant.
Install a bacteria tank for any fish you may want to keep in your pond (optional).
Layer gravel carefully across the bottom of any exposed surfaces of the liner.

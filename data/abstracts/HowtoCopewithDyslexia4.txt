Practice decoding words.People with dyslexia often have difficulty decoding words and often focus so much on decoding that they donâ€™t remember what they have read.Word decoding can improve your reading fluency which will help improve your reading comprehension.
Ignore, then address spelling.
Use models when writing.Because people with dyslexia may struggle with remembering correct letter and number formation, it helps to keep a picture or have someone write a great example of the characters that give you the most difficulty to refer to when needed.An index card with uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as numbers handwritten on it, is an unobtrusive may to have character models.
Plan and review your writing.Thinking about what you want to write before you begin writing can help focus your writing.

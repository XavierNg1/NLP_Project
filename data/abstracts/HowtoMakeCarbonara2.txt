Chop half of a yellow onion finely and add to the meat as it cooks.
Add 2-3 cloves of minced garlic for the last minute the meat cooks.
Deglaze the meat pan with a sharp kick of white wine, especially if you added onion and/or garlic.
Add 1 cup of cooked peas for a splash of sweetness and greenery.
Toss in a splash of fresh cream or whole milk as the meat and pasta cook.

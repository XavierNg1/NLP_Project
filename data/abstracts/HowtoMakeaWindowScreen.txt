Measure the height and width of an open window frame.
Saw the aluminum frame pieces with a hacksaw at the length you measured.
Use a metal file to remove any rough edges left when sawing.

,
Using the pieces you cut now connect the upper and lower window corners with 4 plastic or aluminum corner inserts.
Hold the frame in place.
Lay the screening material straight on the frame (you need about 1 inch or 3 cm or more oversize around all four sides).
Pull the screening slightly tight, first in the length and then in the width -- being careful not get a warp in the frame or "waves" in the screening material.

,
Press aluminum wire screening material into the slots (channels) using the convex end of the spline roller.
Press the rubber spline into the frame after the aluminum screen is in the slots with help of the concave end of the spline roller.
Cut the unnecessary screening carefully away with a sharp hobby knife.
Turn the window screen for the spline to be to the inside.

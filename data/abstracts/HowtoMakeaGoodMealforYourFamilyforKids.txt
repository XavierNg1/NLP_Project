Decide which meal you want to prepare and have a recipe for it.
Take one of your parent's cook books and find an easy recipe you would like to make.
Look in your kitchen, or even your garden, and see the ingredients you have.
Know the differences between Tsp and Tbsp.
Carefully follow all the directions for the meal.
If you are not sure of how long the cooking is going to take, you may keep the ingredients like vegetables, spices, oil etc ready.
If you know to prepare a certain dish but you have skipped it for now, you may keep as an option.
When you are done cooking, proudly serve your family the meal and ask them what they think.

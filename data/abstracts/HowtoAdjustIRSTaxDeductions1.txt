Gather all of your records together.
Set a time when you won't be disturbed for an hour, or so.
Get your records, tax forms, instruction, your calculator, and the IRS Pub 17 (a PDF available at: http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p17.pdf) together.
The W-4 is not the same as a return.
If you make a mistake, don't panic.

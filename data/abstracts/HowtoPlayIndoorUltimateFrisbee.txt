Have the team captains determine the order.
After the toss each team lines up four players (often a 3:1 ratio of men and women) on opposing baselines on the basketball court.

,
Each player on the team pulling lines up opposite the person on the other team they wish to mark.
The team with the disc then pulls.
The opposing team receiving the pull has two options: a) they can catch it and if they do they must play from that point, or b) they can leave it to hit the ground and then play the disc from where it lands.
The first person to pick up the disc after a pull must check it into play.
Offence is prohibited from running with the disc.
If a player catches the disc on the line it is out.
When a player catches the disc the leg that is opposite to the arm they throw the disc with becomes their pivot foot and must remain stationary but they are able to move their other leg around allowing them to fake while trying to throw the disc.
When offence has the disc, defenders must each have a player to mark.
The defender marking the player with the disc counts a stall count out loud.
If a disc hits the ground or is intercepted or knocked down by the opposition, then it is a turnover.
To score, offence needs to catch the disc in the endzone that can be a marked out rectangle or, in New Zealand, we use the basketball key as the endzone.

After a team has scored a point, they keep hold of the disc and wait while the opposition walks back to the opposing end of the court.

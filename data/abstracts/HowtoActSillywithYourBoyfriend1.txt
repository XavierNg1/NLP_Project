Take silly pictures, making odd faces.
Speak in foreign accents.
Give each other embarrassing makeovers.
Have a food fight.
Go to the park and play on the jungle gym.
Do impressions of each other.
Play catch with your food.
Play-fight with him.
Play hide-and-seek.
Act out a scene from a movie you both like.

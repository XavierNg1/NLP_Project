Make sure that you have all of the supplies that you will need.
Determine the type of paint on the brick (latex or alkyd/oil-base).
Using an old paint brush or sponge, saturate the painted area you're working on.
Have a look at the paint and once it begins to come up/flake off, start to scrub it off with the wire brush.Always keep the room well ventilated when using any paint removers - most are flammable and the fumes are toxic.
Wait out the smell.
Depending on the age of brick you're working on, it may actually be stamped and colored concrete, not a clay brick.

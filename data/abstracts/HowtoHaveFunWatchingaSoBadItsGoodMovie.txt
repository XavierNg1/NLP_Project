Find a movie to watch.
If possible, find some friends to watch the movie with.
Avoid taking the movie too seriously.
Feel free to crack jokes, mock the characters, yell at the television, and verbally question what the director was thinking when they decided to make the movie.
After the movie is over, take some time to reflect.
See what others have to say about the movie.
Watch the film several times, with reasonable time in between (weeks or months, at least) to regain your sanity.

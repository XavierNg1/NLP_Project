Put on additional clothing.
Put on a hat, mittens, and a scarf.
Use blankets or other materials instead of clothing.

Consume hot foods and warm, sweet liquids.Having foods and drinks that are already warm will raise your body temperature even more than digestion alone will, because your body will absorb the heat from them.
Keep moving.

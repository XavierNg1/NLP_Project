Roll a pair of baby socks up, starting from the toes and ending at the heels.
Open up a diaper, then fold it in half lengthwise.
Position the rolled up baby socks at one end of the folded diaper.
Start rolling the diaper tightly around the sock.
Wrap a rubber band around the center of the cupcake.
Fold a baby washcloth lengthwise so that it is the same height as the rolled up diaper.
Wrap the washcloth around the rolled up diaper, and secure it with another rubber band.
Cover the rubber band with a pretty ribbon.
Place the cupcake into a cupcake liner.
Consider making more cupcakes and displaying them in a cupcake box or on a tiered cupcake stand.

Plan the game out if you're doing this at a party.
Make sure you have a full day to yourself.
Sort out all of the hiding spots that you marked down.
Take a fairly big paper and draw the outline of your house on it.
Make a list of places base could be.
Don't hide with anyone unless you know they won't say where you are if they get caught.
Be alert.
Think ahead.
Put on some soft music, so if you make a little or big sound, more than likely, no one will hear.

,
Try not to repeat hiding spots unless the hiding spot you've been using hasn't been found yet.
Depending on where you're trying to move to, walk slowly, or try to walk without making a sound.

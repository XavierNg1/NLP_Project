Firstly, brush out your hair so that it is free of tangles.
In a bathroom or kitchen (anywhere without carpets) set up what you need.
Once the roots are well covered, move down to the mid and end sections of the hair.
Don't rough up the hair, apply gently.
When all the hair is thoroughly covered, comb through gently, twist up onto your head and use a large clip to hold it.
Leave for one hour, then remove the towel, cling film and clip.
Once dry, brush out.

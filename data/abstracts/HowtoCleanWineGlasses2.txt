Choose short-stemmed wine glasses made out of glass.
Plan on washing the glasses separate from the rest of your dishes.
Place the glasses upside down on the top rack, and space them so that they are not touching.
Use a small amount of odorless detergent.
Use a short, gentle cycle.
Skip the drying cycle.
Dry the glasses by hand if you live in an area with hard water.

Keep your WoW CDs and CD key safe.
Have a Strong Password.
Don't share accounts.
Don't click strange links in websites.
Keep your antivirus and firewall up to date.
Watch out for phishing.
Never log onto World of Warcraft from a computer that isn't your own, or one you know is 100% free of virus, keyloggers and evil software.
Guild leaders, don't let any guild members have access to your guild bank unless they have an authenticator.
Get an authenticator.
Be careful which addons you download.
Keep your operating system up to date.
Don't use powerleveling “services”.
And in case you're still dead set on giving your email account and password to a random foreign company whose business is based on violating Blizz's terms of use:


“Through our normal support processes and the assistance of players, we also find that many accounts that have been shared with powerleveling services are then hacked into months later, and all of the items on the account are stripped and sold off.
Ouch.

Gather a empty pop or soup can.
Make a small hole in the top and bottom of the can.
Put a small straight stick or round piece of wood through the holes.
Spread peanut butter on the can.
Set it all on top of a five-gallon bucket.
Sit and wait.
If you made a live trap, release the mouse 5-10 miles away from habitation.

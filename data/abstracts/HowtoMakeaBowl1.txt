Purchase some craft clay that can self-harden.
Roll a small but decent-sized lump of the clay into a ball.

,
Continue to roll this ball into a fat sausage shape.

,
Keep rolling until you have a long and thin sausage shape.
Starting at one end of the sausage, coil into a spiral.
Coil around and around until the sausage length ends.
Make more long sausage lengths from the clay.
Add the next length on top of the coiled base.
Keep adding a new length on top of the old length, coiling until the bowl is the height you'd like it to be.
Either leave natural clay color or paint with a suitable paint.

It's important to understand that they only sting when attacked.
While the method suggested here basically kills the wasps in their nests, there is no other (safe- for-nearby-pets) way to eradicate them.
Get the supplies.
During the day, when the wasps are up hunting for cicadas in the trees, mark each nest you find with one of the plastic knives pushed into the ground as close to the hole of the nest as possible (without disturbing the hole).
After 10:30 or 11pm, (later is better), that evening, using a flashlight, seek out the knives you placed and carefully pour about two-to-three cups of ammonia into each of the holes.
The next day, repeat the process on any new nests that you find in the ground.
Try this option if you're happy to let nature's creatures follow their natural cycles without freaking.

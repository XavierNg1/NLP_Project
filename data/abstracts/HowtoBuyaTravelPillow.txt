Consider which shape you're most comfortable with.
Consider the pillow material.
Narrow your travel pillow options down by size and weight.
Test the pillow mechanism--if it packs down small or inflates and deflates--several times to make sure it's sturdy and easy to use.
Practice removing the pillow's cover, if it has one, then working the pillow back into the cover.

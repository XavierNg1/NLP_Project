Get your duct tape...It's sold in a bunch of colors so pick one or two of your favorite colors.
Break the skewer in half.
Rip, or cut, 27 two-three inch strips of the duct tape.
Take one strip and fold it almost in half so you have a triangle on one side.
Take that strip and fold the side with the triangle, fold the sticky side down so you have a non-sticky triangle on one side and then a bit of sticky duct tape on the other side.
Repeat steps 4, 5, & 26, more times, or until you run out of duct tape strips.
Wrap your skewer in green duct tape.
Start wrapping the petals around the skewer, making sure it kind of looks like a flower.
Take a strip of your green duct tape and wrap it around the bottom of the flower into the stem area, it looks cleaner this way.
Give, sell or keep your beautiful flower!

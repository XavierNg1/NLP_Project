Acknowledge joy, or the joy of living.
Slow down.
Accept and revel in the fact that you're not perfect.
See the wonder in people and find miracles and joy in everyday things.
Feel adequate.
Put aside the ego and embrace the community of relationships around you.
Rediscover your wit.
Make eye contact with people and smile more often.
Make time for yourself.
Be consistent about keeping fit.
Learn something new.
Put more music into your life.
Surround yourself with beauty.
Have fun.

Measure the area where your Draft Dodger will be placed (along the bottom of a door, the inside ledge of the window, etc.).
Select fabric and thread.
Cut your fabric the same length as the inside of the bottom edge of your window (or along the bottom edge of your door), plus 1 1⁄4 inches (3.2 cm) to allow for a 5⁄8 inch (1.6 cm) seam X 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) wide.

,
With the "right" sides of the fabric facing, fold the fabric length-wise and pin it together along the open edges, placing the pins about 4" apart.
On the sewing machine, sew one end and the long side of the tube closed, using a 5/8" seam.
Turn the tube right-side-out.
Stuff the tube.
Close the tube.
Admire your work and place your Draft Dodger where it will serve its purpose!

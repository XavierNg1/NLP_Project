For Cricket, only focus on numbers 15-20, plus the bull's eye.
Set up a chalk board next to the darts board.
Know that if you have closed out a number which your opponent hasn't, and you hit that number, you are awarded that many points.
Know that the person who finishes with all their numbers closed out and the most points wins.

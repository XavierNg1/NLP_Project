Get in touch with your own emotions.
Listen carefully.
Pretend that you're the other person.
Don't be afraid to feel uncomfortable.
Show the other person you feel for them.
Use your empathy to help other people.
Be open to learning more about what you don't understand.
Try harder to empathize with people you don't like.
Make a point to ask people how they feel.
Read and watch more fiction.
Practice empathy with someone you trust.
See it as sharing someone's emotions.
Realize you can feel it for anyone.
See that you don't have to agree with someone to empathize with them.
Forget the "do unto others" rule.
See why empathy matters.

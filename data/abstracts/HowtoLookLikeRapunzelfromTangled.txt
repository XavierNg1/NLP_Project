You have to have long hair, but not 70 feet (21.3Â m).
Rapunzel wore her hair in a beautiful whimsical braid in the movie, because she had to stop people from standing on it.
Make sure you act like a princess.
Practice singing.
Rapunzel is used to doing things by herself.
The world she lives in is old, so Rapunzel doesn't know about modern electronics and the likes.
Dress timelessly and modestly.
Be happy and cheerful.

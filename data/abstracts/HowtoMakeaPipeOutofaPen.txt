Obtain a cheap click pen with a removable cartridge and a metal tip.
Remove the back piece of the pen (the clicky part) and remove the cartridge.
Press the point of the pen tip into the tube so that you have an open, conical "bowl" on top of the pen.
Place a cigarette filter at the other end of the tube to prevent inhaling ash (optional).
Fill the tip with tobacco and light it, then inhale from the other end of the pipe.
Make new pen pipes when you feel like smoking, instead of using the old ones.

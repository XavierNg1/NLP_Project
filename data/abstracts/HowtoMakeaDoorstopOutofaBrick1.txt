Find an old brick.
Purchase wool roving in colors that match your home décor.
Lay a towel out on your kitchen counter.
Lay down another layer perpendicular to your first layer.
Add extra wisps in a contrasting color on the top.
Squirt a small amount of liquid soap onto the top of the wool surface.
Cover the surface of the brick with a sheet of bubble wrap.
Remove the bubble wrap and rub gently on the top of the wool, as if you are petting an animal.
Work around the edges.
Turn the brick over when you’ve felted the top and sides.
Rinse the brick.
Place it on a wire rack to dry completely.

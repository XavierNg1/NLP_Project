Realize and accept that you probably did not miss out on as much as you may think you did.
Remember that a lot of successful people in society weren't exactly prom queens (or kings) either.
Choose not to let it consume your life.
Consider the experiences you have had that those who went to prom may have missed out on.
Give yourself an experience that most others don't have.
Attend a formal event that is open to the public.
If you are currently in college at a residential campus, consider going to formals.
Don't be afraid to create your own "prom experience" if you still feel the need to do so.
If someone else caused you to miss your prom, try to forgive them if at all practical.
Think of it this way- You saved lots of money!

Find an old pot (the smaller the better).
Fill the pot with dishwashing soap.
Heat up the pot on a stove top until it is boiled.
Let the solution stand for a minute before dropping in your diamond ring.
Let the ring sit in the solution for 5 minutes.
Wash the ring with water and dry it.
Also, you should make a Sparkling Diamond Potion with water and ammonia, and leave it overnight.

Set up an SVN server.
Launch Terminal, then create a directory called svnroot in your account directory, as follows: mkdir svnroot


Type: svnadmin create /Users//svnroot






That creates your server!

After the download, start SVNx and you will see two windows named Working Copies and Repositories.

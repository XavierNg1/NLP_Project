Cut a hole in the bottom of 36 (or 2/3) of your bottles.
Fill 18 (or 1/3) of the bottles halfway with dirt (if there are a lot of stones or rocks in the dirt, filling the bottle ¼ of the way is fine).
From the bottom of each bottle, measure up 10 centimeters (3.9 in) and mark it on two sides.
Make 18 columns of bottles with 3 bottles each.
Line the columns of bottles in a row.
Bring the ends of wires together in each row and tie them together and close with wire cutters.

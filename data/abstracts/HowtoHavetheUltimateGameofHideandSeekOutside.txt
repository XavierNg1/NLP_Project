Start out by using common sense.
Remind yourself of earlier games you've played.
Very carefully, look around your back yard, or where ever you're playing.
Do not move from your hiding spot!,
Remember to have the correct attire for the game!,
Leave no evidence!,
Do not have anything that makes noise or has light!,
Keep your lips shut!,
The Golden Rule Of Hide and Seek!,
Never go to the same hiding spot in the same game!,
Always Have a Back-up plan (or a plan-B)!,
Keep your friends close; but your enemies closer.
Use code!,
Secrecy is key!,
Have fun!

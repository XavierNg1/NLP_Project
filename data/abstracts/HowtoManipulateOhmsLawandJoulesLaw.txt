Memorize Ohm’s law (V=IR) and Joule’s law (P=IV);
,Learn the meanings of “V”, “I”, “R” and “P” V= Voltage, I= Amperage, R= Resistance, P= Power

,
Solving for “I” using Ohm’s law.
Solving for “R” using ohm’s law.
Solving for “I” using Joule’s Law.
Solving for “V” using Joule’s Law.
Inserting ohm’s law into Joule’s Law.You can also manipulate Step 8 (P=I^2R) using the same method as step 3 and get R=P/I^2 and I^2=P/R

,
Inserting step 3 of Ohm’s law into Joule’s Law.You can also manipulate step 9 (P=V2/R) by multiplying both sides of the equation by “R” you eliminate the “R” on one side and get PR=V^2 (see diagram 5) and by using the same method as step 3 you can get R=V^2/P

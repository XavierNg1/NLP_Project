Choose a crown tower to focus target and then attack it, but remember to defend too.
When playing, let the enemy go first, or activate the card.
Be sure to have a good deck.
Always remember to take care and keep eyes on your tower.
After the crown tower is destroyed, either attack main tower or attack the other tower.When you knock both towers down, go after the King's tower.

Find a local newspaper and read it.
When you are doing the exchange, go out and interact with people.
Talk to people about your experiences, why you feel homesick, and ask them if your experiences are normal.
Go shopping.
Go to Starbucks, McDonalds, Subway, Dunkin Donuts, Taco Bell, TGI Fridays, KFC or other multinational fast food type places.

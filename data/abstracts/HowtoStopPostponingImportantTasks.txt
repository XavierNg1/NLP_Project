Start on the easiest of your tasks, if there are several tasks you must complete.
After you complete a task, scratch it off your list, it'll make you feel like you accomplished something.
After every hour of work, stop, and take a ten minute break.
Attempt speeding up your process by looking at each way possible to lessen the amount of time to complete the most amount of work.
Once you complete your work, make sure it's 100% ready to go.
If you're sleepy and you need to finish work, but you're so tired you can't think, then you have two options: Don't sleep, and do it!,
Don't be a perfectionist.
Stay encouraged and motivated to do the work.
Maintain intensity and endurance throughout your work experience, whatever the case may be.

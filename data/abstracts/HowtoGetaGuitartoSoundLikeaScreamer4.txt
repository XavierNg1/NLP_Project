Get a guitar with a floating bridge (like those made by Floyd Rose or Kahler).
Use a finger (the middle works well) on your left (fretting) hand to flick the G string.
Pull the bar upwards to "dump" the string into a massive dive bomb.
Slam the bar down, bringing the pitch up and abruptly tightening the string.

Obtain gallstones.
Place the gallstones between sheets of paper, then crush them by pounding lightly with a hammer.

,
Sterilize the gallstones by washing them with household bleach (5% sodium hypochlorite solution).

,
Weigh out the crushed gallstones.
Add the crushed gallstones to a reaction container.

,
Add 2-butanone (methyl ethyl ketone), about 10 cc per gram of crushed gallstones, to the reaction container and heat to a gentle boil.
Filter the hot solution through a paper filter disk/cone on a funnel into another clean container.
Add methanol (caution: extremely toxic "wood alcohol") to the filtrate, about 5 cc per gram of starting crushed gallstone.

,
Reheat the filtrate to a gentle boil, then add water drop by drop until a very faint cloudiness appears.
Carefully remove the solution from heat.
Once at room temperature, unwrap and cool the container in ice to allow more cholesterol to crystallize out of solution.

,
Collect the cholesterol by filtration.

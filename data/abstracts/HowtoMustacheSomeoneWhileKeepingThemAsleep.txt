Before you do the trick, plan on a piece of paper or a white board and plan what you are going to draw.
Get a marker or pen.
If you are planning on doing this during the day, or waiting for the prey to fall asleep, keep it a secret!,
Wait.
Stay quiet.
Move slowly towards the prey and begin to draw.
If there are other people with you make sure they know what's going on.
In the morning, resist laughing at all costs.

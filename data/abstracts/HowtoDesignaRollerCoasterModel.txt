Choose the design which you want to be made into a model.
Make sure the design is properly put together, and completed.
Select the type of material you would like for your model to be made of.
Map out how you plan on building your model on its structure, track, and supports.
Be sure to build your model on a material (preferably green or brown to resemble the ground) which will stand firm.

,
Check to make sure all parts of the track and supports are in the model such as supports, and all track segments.
Depending on the type of roller coaster, the difficulty of applying the lift hill may vary.
Begin placing 3-4 wires next to each other in the center of the track on the lift hill.

,
Select 2 places at the top and bottom of the track, where the lift will go through to meet under the track.

,
Using great caution, on the side of the first hill begin to thread the wire under the supports, until both ends meet.
Take 3-4 wires, and begin applying them with glue to the top side of the lift hill.
The launch sections are usually simple to place on models, since majority of roller coasters with them are flat.
Apply 2 or 3 wires onto the launching section of the model, up to the hill, inversion, turn etc.
These types of roller coasters use magnetic mechanisms to launch forward.
Hydraulic launched roller coaster models require more attention, because the launch section requires dozens of brakes.
Small metal plates are a great choice, but if you aren't able to get a hold of them, chips of plastic will do.
Once the lift or launch section is completed, you are now ready to begin painting your model.
Design a train for your roller coaster, that has a reasonable amount of cars, depending of the size of the model.
Gather all types of scenery which you purchased earlier, and begin to bond them onto the surface which the model is built on.

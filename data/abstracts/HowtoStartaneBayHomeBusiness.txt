Decide what to buy and sell.
Get your products from wholesalers or drop shippers: This is a crucial part, because here is where your money has to be invested.
Sell the articles on eBay: Be professional when doing so.
Check your feedback: Always try to keep a good feedback, nothing is more important on eBay, so you should better give somebody a full refund if he returns your product, because one bad rating can ruin your business.

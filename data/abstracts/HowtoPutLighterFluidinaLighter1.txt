Gather your materials.
Insert a pushpin into the valve at the bottom of the lighter.
Make sure the lighter is completely empty.
Prepare the nozzle of the butane container.
Fill the lighter with butane.
Remove the butane container and immediately cover the valve with your thumb.
Insert the pushpin back into the hole in the valve.
Cut off the top of the pushpin with metal snippers, if you want.This is purely cosmetic, since it would look a little strange to have a pushpin sticking out the bottom of your lighter.

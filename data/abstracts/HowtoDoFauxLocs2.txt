Start with freshly washed, braided hair.
Pick a braid to start with, then add some braiding hair to it.
Braid the two together.
Finish off with a regular braid for a few inches/centimeters.
Pull a faux loc through the base of your braid.
Pull the rest of the faux loc through the loop.
Wrap the faux loc around the braid.
Push the hook up through the faux loc.
Catch the braiding hair with your hook.
Slide the braiding hair down through the faux loc.
Repeat the process for the rest of your hair.

Familiarize yourself with the Notations at the bottom of the page.
,
Choose one face to start with.



 






Solve the cross.

Verify your first layer is correct.
Place the four edges of the middle layer.
Verify correct positioning.
Permute the corners.
Orient the corners.
Permute the edges.
Orient the edges.
Congratulations!,
This is the key to the notations used.
This article uses two different views for the Cube:


The 3D View, showing three sides of the Cube: the front (red), the top (yellow), and the right side (green).
For the top view, each bar indicates the location of the important facelet.When a facelet is grey, it means that its color is not important at the moment.
The arrows (blue or red) show what the algorithm will do.
For the top view, the light blue facelets indicate that an edge is incorrectly oriented.
For the move notations it is important to always look at the cube from the front side.

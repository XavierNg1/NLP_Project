Check for poorly defined green shoots, yellowing older leaves and premature leaf drop.
Look for spindly growth and dropping leaves that turn red or purple.
Spot yellow or whitish new leaf growth, with green veins.
If you have blue-green foliage tinting and the tips or edges of the leaves are withered, this indicates that there is a potassium and phosphorous lack.
Consider repotting a neglected plant to give it fresh soil and a new start.

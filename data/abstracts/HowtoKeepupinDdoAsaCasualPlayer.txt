Consider this a checklist of things to consider.
Rewards in DDO boil down to 3 things: XP, Loot, and Favor.
Play a Cleric.
Don't go for the bonus XP such as "conquest" or "ransack" unless it is really easy.
Always do quests on the maximum difficulty that can be *safely* accomplished by your party.
Build or join parties with your level as the minimum, and your level + 3 as the maximum.
Don't be afraid of 10% or 20% penalties for doing a quest that is a little below the group level.
Don't be afraid of the 50% "power level" XP nerf on longer of higher level quests.

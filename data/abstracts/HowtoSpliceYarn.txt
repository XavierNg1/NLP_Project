Separate the strands ("plies") of yarn, using your fingernails or the point of a knitting needle.
Work up to about 3 inches (7.6Â cm) from the end of each piece of yarn.

,
Overlap 1 of the strands from the left-side piece of yarn, and 1 of the strands from the right-side piece of yarn.
Twist the overlapped strands together.
Moisten both hands and work the twisted yarn strands vigorously back and forth between your fingers until they felt slightly.
Trim any remaining loose strands or frayed fibers--the ones you haven't yet twisted--to about half their length.

,
Repeat the twisting process, working the next set of fibers into the spliced strand.

Go to the auto parts store, and acquire some battery terminal goo, the stuff that prevents corrosion.
Remove any rubber or plastic covers off of the battery terminals.
Do you see any blue or white powder/corrosion forming anywhere?,
If yes, you see corrosion, then you've got work to do.
Get a wire brush and scrape off all the corrosion crud from the bolt, the cable assembly and the battery terminal itself.
Check again to make sure you've got every last bit of corrosion brushed off.
Once everything's hunky dory and spotless, then spread the goo or spray all the mating surfaces completely.

Now you're ready to put it all together.

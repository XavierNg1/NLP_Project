Getting a friend or group of friends to walk with you is a great idea.
If you don't have friends you can walk with, bring a portable CD player or MP3 Player (Flash based MP3 players are best for runners, walkers, or joggers.),
While friends and music, are excellent distractions, they are not always practical or affordable.
If all else fails, bring a cell phone along and talk to a friend or someone else you can have a long, distracting conversation with (crush, maybe?)

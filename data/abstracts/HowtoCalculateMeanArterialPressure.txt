Take your blood pressure.
Use the formula MAP = (2(DBP) + SBP)/3.
Alternatively, use the formula MAP = 1/3(SBP – DBP) + DBP.
For estimation purposes, use the formula MAP approx = CO × SVR.
Consider using a calculator for convenience.
Know the “normal” MAP range.
Consult a doctor if you have dangerous MAP or blood pressure values.
Know how certain medical conditions can affect MAP.

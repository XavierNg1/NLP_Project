Remember the last time you fell in love.
Always remain a bit of a mystery.
Don't be afraid to talk to other women in her presence.
Sub-communicate a balance.
Get to know the girl.
Be aware of what you're doing.
Always try to make her smile.
Always make sure she's OK.
Don't let there be too much of a silence.
Act naturally, without giving the impression you are actually changing yourself to make her like you.

,
Be confident without being cheeky.
Stay away from cheesy lines like "Your father must have been a thief, cause he stole the stars and put them in your eyes".

,
Show her you're interested in her by saying, for example, "I like your shirt".
Don't feel obliged to talk to her every time you see her.
During a casual conversation mention you'll be doing something fun this weekend, like going to a new club.

,
Continue the conversation some 10 minutes, then say, "It was nice talking to you.
Some girls however aren't into parties and such like, so perhaps suggest going for a walk together (if you have a dog ask her if she'd like to join you sometime) or maybe going into town etc.

,
Girls like to feel pretty, so make SURE to compliment her.

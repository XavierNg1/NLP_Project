Get a compiler.
After installing DEV-CPP, open it.
Get ready to write a program to display text in a textbox.
In the main screen of DEV-CPP, go to File -> New -> Project.
At the begin of your source, type "#include <windows.h>" (without the quotes).
Write one method to handle all the messages and write another method where we will handle the messages from the resources.
Make a Resource Script.
Make your first control: a simple menu.
The "IDR_THEMENU" part defines your menu as THEMENU.
Now for the button part.
The IDD_SIMPLECONTROL defines your dialog.
That's it!,
Go to File -> New -> Source File.
Save this file as resource.h Do you remember we did "#include "resource.h""?,
Get back to the source, our Simple Program.c or whatever you called it.
Don't worry too much with all the technical stuff here.
Type:BOOL CALLBACK SimpleProc(HWND hWndDlg, UINT Message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam){switch(Message){case WM_INITDIALOG:return TRUE;case WM_COMMAND:switch ( LOWORD (wParam) ) {case ID_HELLO:MessageBox(NULL,"Hey", "Hallo!,
This part handles the dialog messages.
Make sure that your SimpleProc comes before the int WINAPI WINMAIN part!,
Press F9 to compile and run your program!

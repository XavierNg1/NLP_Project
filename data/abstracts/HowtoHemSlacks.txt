Try on the slacks you need to hem.
Ask a friend to put a straight pin in the fabric of one leg at the midpoint of your shoe's heel to measure hems.
Take off the slacks and turn them inside out.

,
Lay out the slacks flat on their side.
Mark a straight line using tailor's chalk across the pin in the pant leg, perpendicular to the length of the leg.

,
Use a measuring tape to make new chalk marks 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) below the original mark.
Flip the pants over and chalk the 2 straight lines across the other pant leg.
Cut a hem in the fabric of each leg at the bottom chalk mark.
Pin the fabric.
Thread a needle with matching thread and sew the hems.
Try the slacks on again in front of a full-length mirror.

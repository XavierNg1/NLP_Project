Make your dough.
Preheat your oven to 375 degrees.

,
Divide the dough into 8, 1/2 cup portions.
Once the dough is prepared, add ½ cup dough to the bottom of the mason jars.
Place the mason jars in a deep dish filled with water, to prevent the glass from breaking in the oven due to sudden changes in surrounding temperature


The water will facilitate heating the dough without the expense of breaking the jar in the oven.
Before adding any more ingredients or layers, bake the dough as is for 15-20 minutes or until brown and crisp.

Add the other layers including the tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and toppings if you chose any.
To complete your pizza, add another ½ cup layer of dough on top of the other layers and toppings.

Place the jars in the deep dish with water to bake once more.
Carefully remove the dish and jars from the oven.

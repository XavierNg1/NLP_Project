Arrive on time!,
You made it to the airport.
Find the computer screen (TV like) that will tell you where to check in.
Get in the correct queue.
Queue patiently, and when you arrive at the desk, greet the check-in clerk and hand over your flight ticket with your passport.

,
If you have any baggage to be checked in, after he/she has checked your documents, you will be asked to place these on the conveyor belt one at a time.
Providing that your baggage is within the correct weight range, you will then say goodbye to your suitcase (until you land at your destination) and it will be labelled with an identification tag, which will have a code that matches one which will be stuck on your passport cover (to track your luggage) and other info like a "HEAVY" tag or "TRANSFER AT" tag.

,
The clerk will then give you back your flight ticket, passport and a boarding card with a seat number.

,
You should now proceed to security.

,
When you reach the security clerk, follow the instructions of the attendant.
When you have successfully cleared security, check the time.
If you have time to spare, check out the shops.
Once you are at your gate, look at a computer screen and it will say your carrier, the flight number and the destination and if you are to wait (no colour), board (green) or if the flight is closing (red).
Once you are on board, you can ask to be shown to your seat if you are unsure.Take your seat, but only put on your seat belt either when you are asked or when your row is full (it saves you to keep standing up when people need to get past you)

,
Fasten your seat belt so you are comfortable, and whilst you wait for everyone else to board, read the safety leaflet first and then read the in flight magazine.
Sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight!

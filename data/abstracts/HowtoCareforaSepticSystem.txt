Understand your septic tank.
Conserve water.
Keep heavy things away from the tank.
Donâ€™t flush or pour non-biodegradables and chemicals down the drain.
Avoid garbage disposals.
Put a liter of spoiled buttermilk down the toilet and flush it once every few months.
Use septic-safe products:

Use environmentally safe soaps as much as possible (dish or hand soap).
Provide good maintenance around the tank:

Cut down all large trees and shrubs near tank and drain (leach field).
Get the tank pumped.
After minimizing the amount of grey water (wash water) that enters the system, filter all washing machine water with a high tech washing machine lint trap filter.

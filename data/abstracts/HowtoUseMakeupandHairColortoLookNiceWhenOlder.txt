Do go lighter if it suits your skin tone.
Use less makeup.
Donâ€™t waste your money on department store foundation, drugstore foundation is fine, if your skin is not too dry try retin-A (prescription) It will remove any skin discoloration and also result in a radiant glow.
Use a high SPF sunscreen every day, even when it's completely overcast.
Drink water and wean yourself off of the juices, smoothies, etc.
If you are over 70 years old, why not try a hairstyle that doesn't require trips to the hairdresser, maybe a short and chic wash and wear style, especially if you have naturally wavy hair, it works great.

Always wear a spritz of your favorite scent...enjoy yourself!,
Wear a good high SPF sunscreen and go out and walk for a comfortable exercise, which you can do well into your 90's if you are in good health.

You will need to obtain and install Ghost on your system.
But here is an important caveat!,
Clone your boot-drive?,
There is no question that earlier versions of Ghost could effortlessly clone Windows XP boot-drives.
Shut down the system and either temporarily or permanently connect the new hard drive.
If you installed ghost on the system where you're cloning the drive, boot to windows on your old drive and go into ghost.
If you made a ghost boot disk boot the system from the disk and ghost will load directly.
IMPORTANT: ONCE THE OPERATION IS DONE DO NOT BOOT WINDOWS RIGHT AWAY!!,
Connect the new (and old if keeping it in the system) drive permanently and close up your PC.

Tell them how wonderful they are, and do it more than once.
Be real.
Offer them a real relationship.
Don't confuse being 'authentic' to relaying every little bit about every part of your life.
Listen to them.
Don't try to change them.
Accept them for who they are.
Don't believe that you are showing love by being a doormat and allowing others to walk all over you.

,
Give of yourself, but don't compromise your beliefs.
Understand that everyone has a purpose and treat them as such.

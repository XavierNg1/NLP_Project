Acquire the wood for a barn siding table by tearing down an old barn, or get it from someone who has already done that.
Clean and mill the wood.
Set your bar clamps on a flat surface and lay out the edges on the end.
Remove the clamps after the glue dries and begin to even the areas by using your plane or by sanding the top flat once the glue has dried.
Sand the edges smooth and route any shape desired once the top is smooth and flat.
Build the base, legs and aprons next.
Attach the top to the base.
Secure the top to the legs by pre-drilling through the apron.
Choose your finish and apply it to the barn siding table.
Begin to apply the finish with the table turned upside down.

See your physician.If you are worried that you may have scurvy, it is important to see your physician for definitive diagnosis and treatment.
Ask for blood tests.If your physician is concerned that you may have scurvy, the next step is to go for blood tests to have your vitamin C and iron levels measured.
Obtain x-rays of your joints.Since scurvy can negatively affect the joints (particularly in young children where it can lead to a growth arrest), your doctor will likely order x-rays of your knees, your wrists, and your ribs as a starting point.

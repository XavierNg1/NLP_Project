Create a safe space for this communication.
Don't use threats as a bargaining chip.
Learn how to argue effectively, with humility.
Say what you do and do what you say (and expect the same from your spouse).
Learn how to celebrate the successes and commiserate the failures.
Leave time for some time apart.
Admit to your spouse that neither one of you is responsible for this lull in your marriage.

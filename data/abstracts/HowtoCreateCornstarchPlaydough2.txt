Combine the baking soda, cornstarch, and water in a saucepan.
Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it starts to turn solid.
Once the ball forms, take the dough out of the saucepan and place it down onto a sheet of parchment paper so that it can cool.
Add the food coloring and essential oils, if desired, and knead until well-blended.
Play with the playdough.

Get some products together first.
Have a nice bath, adding any salts, lotions, bubble bath, shower gels or whatever you prefer to your bath to make it nice and relaxing.
After your bath, get your hair out of your face and fill the sink with warm or colder water (your preference).
Use a sugar scrub and dot your cheeks, forehead, tip of your nose, eyelids, upper lip, chin and neck with it.
After that, use a gentler face scrub on your face and dot the areas you dotted last time.
For oily skin, try using a face mask that is designed for oilier skin afterwards and a non-greasy, light moisturiser.
Body brush your entire body.
Apply a moisturising body lotion all over your body.
Apply hand and foot cream to your hands and feet (obviously) and file any hard, cracked or dry skin away with a pumice stone, PedEgg or file.

After all of this, your body and you should feel amazing.

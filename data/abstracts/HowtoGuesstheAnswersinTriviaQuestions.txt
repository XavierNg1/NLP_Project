Realize that the quiz-setters won't ask questions that are completely impossible.
Look for the clues within the question itself.
Use your general knowledge.
Guess the answer from the topic.
Note the styles of questions that appear on different quiz shows.
If you're serious about quizzes, learn the lists of data that are likely to recur in shows: names of planets and their moons, US presidents and their dates in office, states and their capitals, etc.

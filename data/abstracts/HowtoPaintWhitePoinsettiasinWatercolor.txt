Take a good look at a poinsettia or another white flower to understand its design.Â 
,
Designate the flower heads with circles, drawn lightly in pencil on a piece of #140 pound watercolor paper, 11 x 14" size.
Wet the paper with a wash brush and leave it alone until the surface shine dulls slightly.
Allow to dry.
Draw the berries in the middle of the flower.
Begin to paint the petals by running a line of any color, one that is already in use on your palette, around the edge of the petal.
Create the leaves exactly as you did the petals, except this time, make them shades of green.
Make some branches with the point of a brush to link the flower blossoms.
Finish the piece, let it dry and stand back to see how it looks from a distance.

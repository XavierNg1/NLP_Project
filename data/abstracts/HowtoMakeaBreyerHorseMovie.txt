Clean your Breyer set.
Choose your horse main character.
Use camera angles!,
When a horse is talking, there's something really important to do, is to add a human trait.
Pick a Breyer model that is not just running, walking, trotting, or just standing.
Prepare your script.
Pick a good kind of floor.
Congratulations!

You must not rely on others to take care of you.
Make a choice for your life.
Stop drifting like the fish in the big tank.
Move.
Â Find a road map.
Place one foot in front of the other.
Prepare for a long journey in your mind.
Pass up others who may not wish to go your direction.
Observe all that is around you as you make this journey.
You may see few people on your road you choose in your imagination.
Look out at the scenery.
Be true to yourself.
Figure out the correct time to take risks.
Turn back if you have made a wrong choice.

Kick things off with a dark, moody E power chord.
Use your index and middle finger to fret the 4th fret of the 1st and 3rd strings.
Pick the 1st and 3rd strings with the pinky and ring finger of your strumming hand.
Use your pinky to reach up and play the 6th fret of the 4th string, then hit the double notes again.
Slide the whole form up to the 3rd fret, then repeat.
Slide up again one fret, to the 2nd, then repeat.
Pluck the high-E string, and the note on the 1st fret of the 3rd string, as the chords return to B.
Walk down to the B note to turn the song around.
Alternatively, turn to a big B7 chord to bring the song full circle.

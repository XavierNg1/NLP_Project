Prepare the car.
Tailor your greeting to the person you are talking to.
During the drive, pass from the front of the car, open the door gently, get in as a gentleman (don't fall into the seat like a brick falls from the sky), start the engine, close the door gently, put your seat belt on, and drive off nicely and gently.

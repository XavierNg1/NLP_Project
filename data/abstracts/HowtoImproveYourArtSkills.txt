One of the most important things in art is practicing.
Take a few moments each day to study your surroundings.
Don't get caught up in the color name game.
Learn how to obtain the correct colors and their properties accurately.
Consider investing in better quality art supplies.
Look at other artists' works.
Another good idea is to look up tutorials.
Try out different mediums of art.
Try using a model when you draw.
If you're into anime or a similar style, it always helps to try out some realism.
Don't be afraid to be a rebel.

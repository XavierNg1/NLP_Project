Fill a 5-gallon bucket with water.
Add the corn syrup or molasses to the water.
Place castings in the bucket by either:


putting the castings into a thin mesh "teabag" of pantyhose or a similarly sheer sock and knotting the end.
Realize the grade or particle sizes of your choice of castings (determined by source and packaging process) play a role in making this choice.
Put the worm castings in directly into the bucket.
Use a bubbler like an aquarium pump and air stone if you have one.
Let water and castings bubble (or at least soak) for 24 hours.
To produce high yield tea, conditions should be desirable for the microbes to proliferate, multiplying exponentially.
Use within 48 hours.
Refrigerate (in a sealed, labeled container) for up to 3 days.

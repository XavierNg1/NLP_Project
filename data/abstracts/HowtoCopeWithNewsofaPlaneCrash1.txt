Assess the likelihood of someone you know being on board.
Keep trying to reach the person in question if you are certain that they were expecting to catch a plane from the crashed plane's airport at the relevant time.

,
Find out the number of the airport, emergency services numbers or hotlines and contact them for information.
If you do find out that a loved one or someone you know was on board a crashed flight, there are some things that you will need to consider:


Keep abreast of the news as to victims.
When things become clearer, make a decision as to whether or not you want to go to the location nearest the crash site to either be there as support when victims are brought back for treatment, or to make necessary arrangements to return bodies back home.
Remember that the "right" decision for you is the one made by you.

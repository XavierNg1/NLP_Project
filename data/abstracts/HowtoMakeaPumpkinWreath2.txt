Paint an 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) Styrofoam ring orange.
Cut the orange tulle into 14-inch (35.56-centimeter) long strips.
Tie a piece of tulle around the ring.
Keep tying the tulle around the pumpkin until the entire ring is covered.
Cut a "stem" from a sheet of brown craft foam.
Hot glue the stem to the back of the wreath, so that it sticks out over the top of the pumpkin.
Cut a 14-inch (35.56-centimeter) long strip of green tulle, and make a knot in the middle.
Hot glue the knot to the back of the stem.
Cut a long piece of green ribbon.
Hot glue the ribbon a few inches to either side of the stem, then use it to hang your wreath.

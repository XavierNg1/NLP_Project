Wrap the blood pressure cuff around your patient’s arm, right above the elbow.
Press the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the brachial artery just below the cuff's edge.
Inflate the cuff to 180mmHg or 30mm above your expected systolic blood pressure.You can find the reading by looking at the sphygmomanometer, which is the gauge on the blood pressure cuff.
Listen for Korotkoff sounds.
Release and remove the cuff.
Wait a few minutes if you want to check the patient’s blood pressure again.

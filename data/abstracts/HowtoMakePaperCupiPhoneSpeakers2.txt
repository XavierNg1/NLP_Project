Find a paper cup wide enough to fit your iPhone.
Use a pen or pencil to trace the base of your phone onto the side of a cup.
Cut the rectangle out partway using a craft knife or box cutter.
Fold the rectangle up at a 90 degree angle.
Place the phone into the rectangle hole, and set the cup down on its side.
Hot glue a pencil to either side of the cup to keep it from rolling around.
Decorate the speaker, if desired.
Stick the phone into the slot.

Make sure everyone knows the rules and safety practices of the range, and that everyone knows when the range is hot (people are shooting) and when all guns must be set down and not touched so people can go downrange.
When the range is hot, go to your shooting bay, load your cartridge or gun, and shoot at your target.Between loading your gun and firing it, turn on the safety.
When you're done shooting for the time, make sure all your gun's rounds are emptied, the gun is completely unloaded, and its action is left open so others can see that it's empty.
When all the shooters are done shooting for the time, make sure it's good with everyone and then declare the range as cold.
Don't be rude or obnoxious.
Know that you may not be allowed to enter as a spectator or guest, and even then you may have to pay to enter the shooting range.
Wear eye and ear protection.
Stay behind the shooting tables and sit quietly.
Don't take any water or food with you into the range.
If you need to ask someone something about the range or shooting, realize that you may have to do so rather loudly due to the ear protectors.

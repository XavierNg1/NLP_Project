Determine if you have a DRAC4 or DRAC5 card installed.
Use the omreport command as another method for determining the DRAC version:



Run the command, omreport chassis info |grep DRAC
On a DRAC4 host = DRAC4 Version : 1.60
On a DRAC5 host = DRAC5 Version : 1.32
It is recommended that you use omreport to determine the DRAC version.

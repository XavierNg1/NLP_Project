Cell phone - No, not so you can receive an "emergency" call in case you need to beat a hasty retreat.
Texture - Here’s a top tip from friend-boys: wear something soft and touchable — a velvet top, angora sweater, silky pants.

Discretion - Do not mention dud dates, evil exes or lingering loneliness.
Perspective - Though having a string of unappealing dates can be wearing, it’s almost never a waste of time.

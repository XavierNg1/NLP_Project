Use a shoelace “book.” This is essentially a large format book with thick pages that have laces weaved into them, just as they would be in regular shoes.
Use shoelaces with different sizes and textures.
Start “big.” If your child is having trouble with the dexterity required for smaller laces, start with a very large format.
Be patient and encouraging.

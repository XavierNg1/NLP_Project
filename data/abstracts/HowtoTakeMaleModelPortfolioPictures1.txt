Shoot outdoors unless you have a near-professionally lit indoor space.
Choose a bland, basic background.
Ensure your model is evenly lit, without any dramatic shadows.
Do your best to make the model comfortable, happy, and willing to play.
Make sure you cover the three "essential" photos before you start getting creative.
Always retouch photos before sending them back to the model.
Send the model the retouched shots for approval.

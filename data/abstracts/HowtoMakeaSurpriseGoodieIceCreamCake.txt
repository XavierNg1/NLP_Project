Take out a big tin.
Start using the ice cream for the bottom layer and spread it across the bottom until all the bottom layer ice cream is in the tin.
Get the next ice cream container out so it starts softening.
Take the tin and the LAST ice cream container for the top layer and let it soften.
Spread the top layer on top of the second goodies.
Finished.

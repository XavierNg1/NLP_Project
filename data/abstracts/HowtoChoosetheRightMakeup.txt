Coordinate the colors.
If you're light skinned, you should wear bronze or lavender purple eye shadow.
If you have medium skin color: Choose chocolate brown or olive green (Make sure the olive is a bit shimmery, so it doesn't drag your eyes down).
If you have dark skin: Choose a dark plum or black-brown matte eye shadow.

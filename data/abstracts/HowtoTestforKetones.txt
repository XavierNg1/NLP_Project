Take a sample.
Divide your sample into two parts.
Test the first sample with Brady's reagent (2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine dissolved in methanol and sulphuric acid).
If the first test is positive, add Tollen's reagent or Fehling's reagent to the second sample.
Interpret your results:

1st test negative = no ketones.

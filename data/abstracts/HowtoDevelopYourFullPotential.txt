Remember your youth.
Remember that there is no right and wrong way of thinking and many times the reason why others try to make you feel inferior when you voice opinions and ideas is because they wish they had had the idea and courage to speak up.
In order to be successful you should realize that you will sometimes make mistakes, no one is perfect and mistakes are ok providing you acknowledge them and learn from them.
When developing your full potential the two most important things to remember are, what you want out of life and what you can realistically do to make that possible.

Get to know the city It is quite useless to try to enjoy a city you are not familiar with.
Identify and use the areas you liked: By this time you ought to have a good idea of the city's network.
Use your iPod/mp3 player/CD player: If you do not have one, consider getting one.
Imagine your walk as a movie scene: While walking, imagine yourself as the person you want to be, not necessarily the person you are.
Notice the small things: Keep an eye out for the little unique things that give each city its charm.
Incorporate your surroundings: Look at what is around you, the things that annoy you and the things that amuse you, and take it all in.
Don't focus on your destination: You know where you are going.
Be patriotic: This may seem like an odd sort of step, but it works.
Take more voluntary walks: Start walking for the fun of it and not just to get from point A to point B.

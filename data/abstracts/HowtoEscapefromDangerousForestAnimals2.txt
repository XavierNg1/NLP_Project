Remember that most snakes are nonvenomous and practically harmless.

,
If you see a snake, back away slowly.
Do "NOT" try to capture or trap a snake.
When attacked: Call emergency services immediately.

,
Wash the bite area with soap and water as soon as possible.

,
NEVER attempt to suck or squeeze the venom out of the wound.
Take off jewellery - the injured area may swell quite a bit, making bracelets, rings, or watches a problem.

,
Make sure the bite is lower than your heart to slow the flow of venom in your bloodstream.

,
If it is a Coral Snake- a snake with black, yellow, and orange bands in that order - pull the snake off you as soon as possible.
Try to remember what the snake looked like, and, if possible, identify the snake.
Drink lots of water as you make your way to a nearby hospital.

,
Do not drink alcohol or use ice.

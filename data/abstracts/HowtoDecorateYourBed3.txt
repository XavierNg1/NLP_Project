Gather your supplies: If you don't have a headboard, you can always make a simple one using some cardboard and colored fabric.
Tape or glue two large pieces of cardboard or foam board.
Consider painting the cardboard white if you are using a light-colored fabric.
Sketch out the shape of the headboard.
Cut the headboard out using a box cutter.
Spread some fabric out on your floor or table.
Spray the fabric and cardboard with spray adhesive.
Place the headboard glue-side down onto the fabric.
Fold the edges of the fabric over onto the back of the headboard.
Hot glue the fabric to the back of the headboard, if necessary.
Hang the headboard above your bed.

We breakdown the overall example layout listed above, into smaller linear runs, like from point A to point B, and point B to point C and so on.
- In this run, B to C, we have a 4' wide gate which is measured from the inside of the gate post to the inside of the other Gate Post, point C. Because we already added the first gate post in the previous section, all we have in the second run is:


4 Wide Gate
Gates include self closing hinges and Z-Lock Lockable Latch and can be upgraded to heavier framing or to an Arch Gate.
- From C to D which is to the Corner Post, we'll have 9' of fence which equals 1.5 panels (9 divided by 6' wide panel), rounded to 2 Panels and 1 Line Post (2 panels minus 1 = 1 Line Post).
- From D to E which is to another Corner Post, the length is 40'.
- From E to F which is to a Gate Post, the length is 42' which is divisible by 6'.
- From F to G which is to another Gate Post, the width of the Gate is 3' (again, inside of post to inside of post.
, 8a, & 8b - The next three runs, from G to J can be done the same way as the previous three sections which lead to another Gate Post.

,
- This last run, J to K is a 10' wide double gate.

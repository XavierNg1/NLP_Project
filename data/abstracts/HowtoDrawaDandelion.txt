Get out the drawing paper and your pencil.
Look at a picture of a dandelion, and note the composition if you intend to do more than simply sketch for practice.
Draw the stem, as a line beginning in the lower part of your page.
Lightly draw a circle at the top of your stem, and put a light mark near the center of it.
Begin a "teardrop" shape with the "point" of the teardrop near the center mark you made in your circle.
Continue making these elongated teardrop shapes around the circle, letting them overlap randomly, until the whole circle is filled.
The shape of many dandelions is a semicircle which can be shown by putting lots of the small petals (because they are most concentrated here).

Decide if you want to include leaves on the bottom of the stem.

Wash your hair.
Towel off your hair slightly, just enough to stop the dripping.
Separate your hair into sections.
Start blow drying at the top/roots, about six inches (15cm) away from your scalp.
Work your way down the hair sections.
Leave your hair a little bit damp.
Finish with a blast of cold air.

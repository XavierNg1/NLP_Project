Gather your supplies.
Dip one head of the cotton swab into whatever cleaning solution you want to use and start poking around in your belly button.
Discard old swabs and repeat the process if your navel is still dirty.
If caring for a piercing, make sure to soak your belly button in salt water.
Make sure you dry your navel carefully after you take a shower.
Remember that you don't have to clean your belly button regularly.

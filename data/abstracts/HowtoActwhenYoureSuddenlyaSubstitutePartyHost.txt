Make sure that you know what/who the party is being thrown for.
Double check with whoever asked you to host or co-host what they expect of you in terms of duties.
If you are required to do the whole shebang, gather the names and addresses (or emails) of all the guests from every resource you have.
By the 3 week mark, have a pretty good idea about what sort of vibe you want going for the party.
Have your menu planned.
Buy your food the week of the event and decide if there are things that you can make ahead to save you time.
Clean your house!,
If your guests don't know you because you are hosting the party for someone else, use a name tag bar (or printed name tags).
Keep an eye on refreshments throughout the party.
Be polite.

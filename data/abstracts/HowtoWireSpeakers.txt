Establish a target listening area.
Place the target seat in a good position.
Hang some thick, rough textured fabric along the wall behind the target listening area.
Place your speakers facing the target area at sixty degree angles.
Ensure that the speakers and the target listening area are all equidistant.
Use a tape measure or string to determine the distance from your amplifier to your speakers.
Keep in mind that if your speakers and your amplifier are in the same room, 16-gauge wire is inexpensive and will be sufficient.
Purchase the wire that you have determined is correct for your needs.
Make sure all your components are completely unplugged.
Prepare your wires for connection.
Split the wire down the center for a couple of inches.
Determine how the wires are to be connected to the speakers.
Insert the wires into the corresponding sockets.
Fasten the connected wires into place.
Make sure you hide the wires or tape them to the floor.

Remember that he is your boyfriend; you chose each other!,
Relax against him.
If you have never been with a boy before, or are really nervous about touching, remember that a single hug or kiss does not immediately lead to sex or groping.
Body language is a big part of relationships.
If you don't like hugging, but don't want to hurt your boyfriend's feelings, tell him outright (not in front of other people!,
It may just be that you are a 'shy hugger'.
Hugging is a very natural way of showing how happy you are to be together through body language, don't be shy about it otherwise he might feel rejected by you if you keep unexpectedly pulling away every time he tries to hug you.

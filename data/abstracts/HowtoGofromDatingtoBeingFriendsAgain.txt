Minimize contact.
Put away items that remind you of the person.
Discuss how much time the two of you won't be in contact for one another.
If either of you decides to date someone new, and you do want to maintain a friendship with them, then let them know what is happening.
Despite your best efforts, you may find that a friendship isn't possible for months, or possibly ever again.

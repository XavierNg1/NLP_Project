Plan your quilt first.
In the same magazine, find a list of basic supplies and tools.
Purchase your fabric and supplies.
Cut out the pieces that go into your quilt top and sew them together, following the instructions in the pattern.
Once your quilt top is finished, measure it and prepare the middle layer or batting by cutting it the same size as the quilt top.
Cut your backing fabric the same size as the quilt top and batting.

,
Lay your backing fabric on a table or other surface big enough to accommodate the quilt.
Lay your quilt top over the quilt back, right side down.
Lay the batting down over both.

,
Baste the three layers together using safety pins all around the edges, about three inches in from the edge.

,
Sew the three layers together with a sewing machine or serger.
After turning the quilt right side out, hand stitch the opening closed, using a small stitch so it can't be seen too well.

,
Tie the three layers together across the whole quilt, top to bottom.

,
Get a sewing needle with a large eye.
Decide where you want the tied knots to appear on the quilt.
Thread the needle but don't knot it.
Cut the threads as you go, leaving enough on both sides to tie a double knot by hand.
Your quilt is done.

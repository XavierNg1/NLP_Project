Choose a piece of furniture to distress.
Protect the area or move the piece to a different location.
If it's painted a color you don't like, use a paint stripper.
Consider adding a stain to a bare wood piece.
If you're okay with the current color, begin sanding.
Wipe the entire piece down with a tack cloth.
Paint your base color.
If you're using two different paint colors, add on wax to the places you want the base color to pop through.
Sand the piece to simulate wear.
Paint your top coat, if desired.
Rub steel wool over the wax, if applicable.
Add cracks to the wood using a chisel and hammer.
Use a wire brush to put light scratches in the furniture.
Use a drill to create small holes in the furniture.
Replace any metal hardware with antique hardware.
If desired, apply a wood stain to the furniture and seal with varnish.
Finished.

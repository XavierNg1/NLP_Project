Don't be cheesy or have dad-jokes.
Start by Introducing yourself and why you are here to speak.
Thank the guests for coming and taking their time to celebrate with you, your family and your daughter on her special day.
Tell them about your daughter.
Tell them about your new son-in-law.
To conclude toast the new couple and wish them all the happiness and everlasting love you ever wished your daughter to have ever since you first held her as a new-born.
After the wedding and the honeymoon contact the new couple and thank your daughter for the opportunity to speak and for being your daughter and for being as perfect as she is because she is exactly the way she is meant to be.

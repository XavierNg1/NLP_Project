Set aside a full weekend for this project.
If you don't have shelving in your garage already, consider purchasing a strong shelving unit for your garage walls.
Buy a number of plastic containers with lids that will fit into your shelving unit.
You will need three (3) areas or containers for the following:


Trash
Donation/Sell, and
Action Items.
Throw away any obvious junk that is lying around that you never use.
As you go through all of your stuff, you will want to organize it into major categories; for example, tools, Christmas ornaments, collectibles, pet supplies, etc.
Consider using eBay, Etsy or other online sales sites to sell anything that has commercial value.
Start collecting these groups of things in the separate containers you purchased.

,
When a container is filled, label it clearly, put it on a shelf, and start filling the next one.
When you are finished, call the people you need to return things to and arrange to drop them off or have them picked up.
Review the items that need repairs.
Take the donation stuff to donate to charity immediately.
Get to the business of selling what you can.
Now you can sweep your newly acquired floor space.

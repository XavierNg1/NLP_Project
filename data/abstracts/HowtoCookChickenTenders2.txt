Soak your chicken tenders in a dish of buttermilk for at least 2-3 hours.
In a shallow dish, mix 1 cup of flour with salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons of buttermilk.
Remove the chicken strips from the buttermilk and dredge in flour.
Cook the chicken by either pan-frying, deep-frying, or baking, depending on your preferences.

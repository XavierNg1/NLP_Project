Figure out how you define "sexual immorality" for yourself.
Talk to your partner (if you have one) about their personal beliefs about sexual immorality.
Set a list of sexual boundaries you both agree on.
Communicate clearly.
Have respect.
If you are still having problems avoiding sexual immorality, maybe it's because you're in love.

Begin with two or three nice words such as "please" "thank you" and "excuse me" and then introduce more as your child begins to grasp their understanding.
Be persistent and consistent.
Model the behavior and language you desire in your child.
Provide plenty of positive feedback when theyâ€™re signing their words or demonstrating self-control such as waiting in line patiently or helping a friend put away toys.
Have fun with it.

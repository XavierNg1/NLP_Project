Take a deep breath, exhale slowly & smile fondly at the world.
Be thankful that you're not the one in charge of this beautiful melee.
Get a grip.
Remember that you do not know everything yet.
If you struggle with what is, you'll hurt yourself.
Decide what you would like to do about it.
Figure out what's driving you, is it ego?,
Find some trust in yourself.
Be nice to yourself & give yourself a hug.
Invest, not necessarily financially, in being the warmest, kindest, most contented you you can be.

,
Mostly, breathe.

Tell them you'll do no harm.
Give your bear a name and a nickname too.
Show your Teddy around your house, introduce them to your family, your pets, if you have any, and a couple of your favourite other toys.
Have fun with your Teddy, if he or she is up for it on their first day.
If you cannot go out, why not watch a movie?,
Bond with your Teddy bear.
In time make clothes and toys, furniture, a house or even a whole city for your Teddy.

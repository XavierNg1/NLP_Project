Remember that bucket list you made last year that got tossedÂ under your keyboard?,
Find a list of dares from truth or dare online and do them all in public.
Make a list of all of the fears you have.
Name something you say every single day of your life.
Act like a different person for an entire day.
Understand that by trying so many new things, you're bound to fail at a few of them.

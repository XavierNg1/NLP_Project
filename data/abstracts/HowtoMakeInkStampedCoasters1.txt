Get some 4-inch (10.16-centimeter), unglazed, stone tiles.
Wipe down your tiles with a damp cloth, and let them dry.
Coat your stamp with ink.
Press the stamp against your tile, hold it for a few seconds, then pull it away.
Let the ink dry.
Seal your work, then allow the tiles to dry once again.
Add a small or medium-sized felt pad to the back of each tile.

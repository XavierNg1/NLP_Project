Cut a thick piece of cardboard about 6 by 6 inches (15.24 cm by 15.24 cm).
Open the can and mix the Bondo with a stir stick if there is a layer of liquid on top.
Add 1 line of hardener--also known as a catalyst or fixing agent--by squeezing it out of the tube across the top of the Bondo filler.
Use an ice cream novelty stick or a plastic spreader to quickly mix the two substances together.

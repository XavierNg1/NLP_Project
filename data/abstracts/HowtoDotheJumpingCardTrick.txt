Get a deck of cards and soft, bouncy surface.
Hold the card near the upper right corner, with your index finger on the corner and thumb on the back of the card.
"Deal" the card so that the face points in front of you and the bottom left corner of the card is on the table.
Push down and forward with the card's bottom left corner touching the table.
Push until the card "leaps" backward, varying the speed and pressure until you have control of the jump.
Practice re-catching the card smoothly on top of the deck.

Choose the right pan.
Add the butter, lard/bacon fat or oil in the frying pan.
Heat the fat until it is just hot enough to sizzle a drop of water.
Break the egg gently so that it breaks in half.
Repeat with any additional eggs, making sure to space them far enough apart so that the whites don't touch.
Baste butter or oil over the top of the eggs for added flavor.
Consider covering the pan.
Cook the eggs until the whites and yolk reach the desired consistency.
Remove from the heat.
Serve immediately.

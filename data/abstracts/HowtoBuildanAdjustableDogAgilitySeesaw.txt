Cut 2 pieces of the 2"x4"s 28" for the uprights.
Cut 2 pieces of the 2"x4"s 40" for the feet.

,
Measure to find the centers of the feet and mark with the pencil.

,
Nail one upright to each foot, making sure it's in the middle and the bottom of the upright is even with the bottom of the foot.
For the angled pieces, take one of the remaining pieces of 2"x4" and line up the bottom corner of it with the inside bottom corner of one end of one of the feet.
Cut along these lines.

,
Check to make sure the angled bar fits: Line up the bottom with the inside end of the foot and the top flush against the side of the upright.
Nail each angled piece in place.
From the bottom of each upright, measure up and mark at 8", 12", 18", and 24".
Drill the holes.
Cut 2 17" pieces from the remaining 2"x4"s. Nail them on either side of the uprights (which are on the inside) to connect the two sides, and make sure they are also even with the bottom of each side.

,
If it feels a little wobbly, reinforce the base with wood screws until it is stable, mostly where the feet, uprights, and cross-pieces connected.
Choose a back side of your 2"x12"x12' teeter board.
Place the fulcrum.
Take the pipe straps off the board and mark the contact areas, 36" from the ends for USDAA, 42" for AKC.
Paint the base all over with the same blue paint, 2 coats.

,
Screw the 3 pipe straps onto the back of the teeter board, with the pipe in place to use as a guide.
Assemble your teeter and enjoy!

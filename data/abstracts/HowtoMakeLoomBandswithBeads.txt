Get your materials together.
Start stringing your loom bands as you would in a fishtail loom.
Put an 'S' clip on the figure of 8 band.
Take a third loom band and place it on your middle finger and index finger.
Repeat until you reach the end of the bracelet and it is long enough to go around your wrist.
At the end, put a last band on but don't put a bead on.

Get the attitude down!,
Be aware of your surroundings, and take interest in them.
Carry interesting things.
Pick things to do.
Try not to blink a lot.
Look straight into their eyes and slow your breathing down; everyone you look at will do the same.
Stare at someone intently.
Cover your mouth and nose lightly when at school, work etc. not like you're about to hurl though.
You also want to eat a really big breakfast so at lunch you do not eat in front of people (or drink) then when you get home you can eat.

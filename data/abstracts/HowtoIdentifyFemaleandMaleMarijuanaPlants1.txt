Look thicker, sturdier stalks with fewer leaves on male plants.
Check your plants regularly from July to September to sex them.
Check the joints on the stalk for male flowers.
Know that hermaphroditic (both sexes) plants exist, and should be treated as males.
Throw out or remove male plants unless you specifically want seeds.

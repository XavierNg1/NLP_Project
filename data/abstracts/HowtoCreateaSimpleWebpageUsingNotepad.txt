Open Notepad.
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) uses tags.
The first tag of a webpage is usually: <html>.
The next tag is <head>.
On the next line after your head tag, put a title: <title>wikiHow HTML</title>

,Now end your head by typing </head>

,
Next in our website comes the <body> tag.
Between the two body tags goes the content of your webpage, what the user sees.
Another tag that can go in the webpage body is the <p> tag, or paragraph tag.
You probably don't want a webpage that's all plain text.
What really makes a website interesting is pictures.
Almost done!,To finish up, you need to end your body with </body>, and entire webpage with </html>

,
Save your work, making sure to save the file with '.html' at the end.If you want to put your website on the web, see How to Publish a Website on Your Own Domain

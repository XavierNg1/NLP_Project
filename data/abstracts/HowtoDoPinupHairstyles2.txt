Sport a retro Ponytail to the office, out for a picnic at the park, or for a daytime date for a playful, flirty look.
Begin by parting your hair from ear to ear, tracing the top of your head to create a front section of hair that would cover your face if you let it fall.
Tease the hair you did not just section off with a narrow-toothed comb starting at the crown of your head just back from the part you just created.
Work your way down the back of your head, teasing about a three-inch section of hair from your part toward your neck.
Pull all of the hair in the back section into a high Ponytail, smoothing the underside with a smoothing brush as you go.
Next, take your front section down and divide it into two smaller sections.
Take one section of the front hair and sweep it back to your Ponytail, creating a loose wave on the side of your head.
Repeat for the second side.
Spray your head with hair spray.

For a fancier feel, you can curl the hair in the Ponytail with a curling iron.
Add a wow factor to your Ponytail by creating a swirl in the front of your head just above your forehead instead of the sweeping side pieces you created in steps 6 through 8.

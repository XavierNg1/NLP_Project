Turn off the water supply for the ice maker.
Pull the refrigerator away from the wall.
Find the plastic water hose that brings water into the refrigerator.
Inspect the water hose.
Cut the water hose with a sharp knife about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) on either side of the leak.
Splice the two ends of the water hose with a 5⁄16 inch (0.8 cm) "union connector" that is expressly for this purpose.
Turn the water back on and be sure that your splice is watertight.
Push the refrigerator back into place.

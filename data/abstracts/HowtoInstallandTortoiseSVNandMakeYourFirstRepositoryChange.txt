Hey presto!,
To work with a Subversion repository we first need to download a local copy (called a working copy) of either the full or part of the repository.
Open Windows explorer, go to the new directory and right click within the folder space.
You'll now see the progress of the checkout.
Next, it's time to make a change.
We'll now make a change to a file.
You'll notice that once saved, 'system.txt' now has a different icon overlaid, showing an exclamation mark in a red circle to denote that it has been changed.





,
Having tested the change, it's time to add it to the repository.
You'll be prompted for a message to associate with the changes you've made.
The outcome of the commit will appear in a dialog window.
Next we'll add something new to the repository.
The added elements should now appear in Explorer with the 'added' overlay icon.
It's always good practice to leave a note, whenever you do a commit.You'll get a log of the commit, confirming that your new files are now part of the new repository revision.
That's all there is to using Subversion with the TortoiseSVN client.

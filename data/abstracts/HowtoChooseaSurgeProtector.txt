Know that commonly used surge protection devices include the point-of-use surge protection device and the service entrance protection device.
Choose the service entrance surge protection device if you want to provide protection at the initial point of entry, usually outside of your home, generally located where the electrical panel or electric meter is situated.
Select the point-of-use surge protection power strips if you are looking for portability and only need to protect a few electrical devices within your home.
Consider getting both service entrance surge protection devices and the point-of-use surge protection power strips if you want a high level of protection.
Realize that many surge protectors provide a warranty from the manufacturer for your connected equipment if it becomes damaged during a power surge.
Choose a surge protection device based upon your personal needs.
Visit your local hardware store or large retail chain store that specializes in products for the home.

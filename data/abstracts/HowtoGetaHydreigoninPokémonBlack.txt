Go to Victory Road.
Carry a Pok√©mon with you that has status-affecting moves such as Thunder Wave or Hypnosis.
Carry some Ultra Balls or Dusk Balls.
Carry some Potions as well.
Once you come across one, try using False Swipe to lower it's hp down and then putting it to sleep.
Once you have your Deino, start leveling!,
Zweilous doesn't evolve until level 64, at which point, you will have your pseudo-legendary!

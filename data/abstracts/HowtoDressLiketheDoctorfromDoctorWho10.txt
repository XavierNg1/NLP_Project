Emulate Christopher Eccleston, if you want a pretty easy costume to copy.
Get a long, black, double breasted leather jacket.
Add a pair of black pants.
Get a shirt.
Add the sonic screwdriver and a pair of tough looking work boots - doc martens could do the job, just make sure you don't get the 'smooth' pair.
"Fantastic!"

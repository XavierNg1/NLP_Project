Learn the difference between the types of MRSA.
Protect yourself with gloves.If you work in a medical setting, you absolutely must wear gloves when interacting with patients.
Wash your hands regularly.This is perhaps the most important practice for preventing the spread of infectious diseases.
Pre-screen all new patients for MRSA.When you're dealing with patients' body fluids — whether through sneezing or through surgery — it's best to pre-screen for MRSA.
Isolate patients suspected to have MRSA.The last thing you want in a crowded hospital setting is for an infected patient to come into contact with uninfected patients there for other reasons.
Make sure the hospital is well-staffed.
Be vigilant for signs of hospital-acquired MRSA.
Follow procedure when placing central venous lines.Whether placing the line or caring for it, lax hygiene standards can contaminate the blood and cause infection.
Take the time to maintain hygiene when handling ventilators.Many patients get MRSA pneumonia while on the ventilator.

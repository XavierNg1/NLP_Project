Assemble the items needed.
Measure the flat seat of the bench - length and depth.
Cut seven pieces of fabric.
Measure out the first piece of fabric, adding a half an inch to each side for seam allowance.
Calculate the size of the bottom pieces.
Measure out two pieces of fabric -- one that is 14 inches by 16 inches, the other that is 27 inches by 16 inches.
The sides of the sewn cushion cover will need to be 3 inches to accommodate the 3 inch upholstery foam.
Measure two long strips of fabric 41 inches by 4 inches.
Cut out all seven pieces of fabric, taking care to cut each side as straight as possible.
Mark the fabric.
Lay out the biggest piece of fabric right or "good" side up.
Position your needle so the first stitch will enter the fabric at the dot or circle you've drawn half an inch in from the corner.
Lay out the main fabric piece with the long strips sewn on, right or "good" side up.
Sew the shorter strips to each side of the main piece, beginning and ending at your corner marks and avoiding the long fabric strips.
Add a hem.
With the main fabric piece again laid out right side up, with the strips sewn on and also laid out flat, pin the un-sewn or raw end of the larger back piece to one of the short end strips.
Do the corners.
Repeat for all four corners.

,
To complete the cushion cover, pin the loose ends of the larger back piece to the long end of the long side piece, again taking care to avoid any seam allowances.
Sew from the corner mark right along the long edge and over the hemmed end of the back piece.
Taking care not to cut into your stitching, clip each corner so the extra fabric won't bunch inside.

,
Turn your cushion cover right side out.
Insert the upholstery foam by tucking one end of the foam under the larger piece on the back of your cover first, then putting the rest in under the smaller piece.

Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
Beat together (using an electric hand beater) the butter, brown sugar, white sugar, vanilla extract and egg in a small bowl.
Sift the flour into another bowl.
Add the baking powder, salt, oats and desiccated coconut to the bowl with the flour and stir together gently.
Stir the dry mixture into the butter mixture.
Line a baking tray with baking paper (parchment paper).
Scoop out biscuit mixture with a teaspoon and place each piece of dough on the baking paper.
Sprinkle the extra desiccated coconut over the biscuits and place the tray in the oven to bake for about 10 minutes.
Take the tray out of the oven and transfer the biscuits to a cooling rack.
Allow the biscuits to cool for a few minutes before serving.

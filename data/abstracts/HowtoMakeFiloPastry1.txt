Sift the flour and salt into a bowl, stirring to mix.
Make a well in the center of the flour, adding the olive oil, vinegar/lemon, and warm water.
Stir the mixture as you until it becomes a well-combined dough.
Place the dough on a lightly floured countertop and cover your hands in olive oil.
Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes until smooth and shiny, adding oil to your hands if it sticks.
Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with a damp towel, and let it sit for 2 hours.

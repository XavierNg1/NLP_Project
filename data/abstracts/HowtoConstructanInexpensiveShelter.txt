Build two parallel four foot fences, thirty feet long.
Find the four end posts that will create the imaginary rectangle.
Brace the posts when the positions are correct and the posts are plumb.
Using a wheelbarrow, mix three sixty pound bags of concrete and water until you have a wet (but not watery) batch of concrete.
Find the post with the highest ground elevation, and measure from the ground 4' up the post.
Using your 10' pressure-treated 2”x4”s, cut them to the exact length between each post.
Place intermediate 2”x4” members on 8' centers from one end post, so that they are able to accept the 4'x8' plywood panels.
Paint the outside and top of the fence with a good outdoor primer and paint.

,
Cut 8 24” pieces from one of the fence top rails.
Drill the holes with a drill press or a portable hand drill.
From the center of the first post, mark along the wall every 10', and then mark a line using a framing square 22” down the wall.
Secure the pipe to the wall using a 4” lag screw and a thick washer between the pipe and wall; do this in only the top hole – do not completely tighten.
Once all the connectors and 118” top rail pipes have been connected, go back and secure the bottom lag screw and washer and tighten both.
Gather four 56” top rail pipes and two end midway connectors and a peak connector.
Add a 56” top rail pipe into the second wall connector (1,2).
Unfold the cover in a large location so that it can accommodate the 20'x 30' size.
Attach 30' ropes in three or four places along the length of the cover through the grommets.
Pull each rope three or four feet, pulling the cover over the framework.
Using a stepladder, secure the center of the cover at the frameworks peak, using a bungee ball at two locations.

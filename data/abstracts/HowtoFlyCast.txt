Strip off about 20 feet (6 meters) of line from the tip of the rod and lay it in front of you.
Pinch the line ahead of the reel against the rod handle with your index and middle fingers.
Raise the rod to eye level.
Lift the rod tip quickly, flipping the line behind you.
Hold the rod upright just long enough to let the line straighten out behind you.
Sweep the rod forward while pulling your elbow downward.
Stop the forward stroke with a snap of your wrist when the rod returns to the 10 o'clock position.
Lower the rod tip as the line straightens out to lay the line, leader and fly on the water.

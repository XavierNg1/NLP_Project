Maintain all equipment in good working condition.
Train all equipment operators in general operating procedures for each machine, and specific safety items for individual pieces of equipment.
Avoid using equipment in poor working conditions such as low light, low visibility, or when you are too tired to operate equipment safely.
Keep people who are not actively assisting in the operation of your equipment well away from the activity.

Be where the operator can see you, whether he or she is on a tractor, on a swather/windrower or in a combine.
Never climb nor reach over a running/spinning PTO shaft.Always make sure the tractor and/or machine is turned off before you climb in to fix or have a look at something.
Check that the machine you are about to turn on is in the Neutral or Park position.When operating machinery, always keep an eye out for things that are beside and behind you, not just on what's in front of you.
Do not wear loose clothing or wear your hair loose when working around moving mechanical parts.
Never get over-confident that hydraulics will always work and keep in place, because they can and will fail.
Farm machinery is not a toy.
Never step in the area where grain is being fed out by an auger.
Always watch the power lines, especially with transporting augers or any other tall equipment.

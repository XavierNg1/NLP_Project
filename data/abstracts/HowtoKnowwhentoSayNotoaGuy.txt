By default, we can say No to a guy when we don't like him or when he did not reach our expectations..The first thing which we need to have a good idea is about our own feelings, ideas and plans.
Let me get you one sweet example about this.One day, I went to one of my cousins marriage.
Till that moment, I used to have a plan about my life partner like good height, simple and smart.
Marriage was done and finally he again came to me and said "shall we go out for a ride?",
Everyone was in a mood to empty the place because the wedding was done.
One day, I caught his mobile number and contacted him with happiness, it was very thrilling..
Finally he said..
In this situation, I and my hero(still) felt like "No" this is not correct.
Important is, everyone (both families) should be happy and the couple mainly should be happy.

It is usually initiated from a stopped position, and can get you turned around even in a tight location (without an 8-point turn).

,
For this maneuver to be executed properly, you need enough room to have the car sideways, and then some.
Drive to one end of the area with your backend pointed in the direction you wish to go.
As soon as the slide is half-way through, put the car in gear (drive) and be prepared to step on the gas.
You should practice spinning in both directions.
If you do not put the car in neutral soon enough, or put in the car in gear (drive) too soon, you have the possibility of messing up your transmission.

Choose your colors.
Loop your first color over the the top peg.
Once you have the length you want, place another band over the last peg.
Use your hooking device to unhook the last bandâ€”the lowest on the peg.
Slip your hook through the "frown" of the peg to which you just hooked the last band.
Continue up the chain until you reach the first peg.
If you've reached your desired length, attach your S-clip or C-clip to that last loop.

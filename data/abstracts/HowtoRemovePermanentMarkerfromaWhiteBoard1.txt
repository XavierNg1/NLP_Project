Use a dry-erase marker to draw over the permanent ink.Cover the marks as completely as you can, and be sure there the dry-erase marker isn't dried out and has plenty of ink.
Wipe off the ink with a clean wipe board eraser or a soft rag.Both the permanent and dry-erase marker should come off easily.
Repeat the process if the board isn't entirely free of markings.

First thing you need is a JAMMA harness.
The JAMMA harness has a standardised wiring code as follows:

,
Physically push the connector onto your JAMMA board.
One way to tell which way around the connector goes is to locate the wires for the power supply as these will have different terminals to the wires for the controls; the JAMMA board will usually have the pinouts labelled if there is no key.
Press the connector firmly onto the board.
Now gather the wires up into groups, for example: player 1 controls, player 2 controls.
If your board has a built in test mode then it is a good idea to have it switched on before connecting up the controls.Once connected, enjoy playing your favourite games.

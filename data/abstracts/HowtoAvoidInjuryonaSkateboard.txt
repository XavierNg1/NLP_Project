Adjust your trucks to however you feel comfortable, especially when you first buy a new board.
Don't go too far outside your comfort zone.
If you lose control over your board, either jump off or stop.

,
If you start falling off your board, there are a few immediate things you must do.
Protect your head at all costs - preferably by using your arms.Owning a bike helmet or specialized skateboarding helmet is preferred for beginners.
Do not extend your hands to try to prevent the fall.
Try to not land on your knees unless you're wearing knee pads.

,
Attempt to roll or keep in a controlled falling motion instead of full forced impact.
After a few hard falls try moving on to something else.

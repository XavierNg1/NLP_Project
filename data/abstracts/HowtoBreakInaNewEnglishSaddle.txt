Make sure your girth fits.
It is best to break in a saddle with an older set of well maintained stirrup leathers.
Do not ride in your saddle the day you bring it home.
Tack up your horse being very careful to have your girth adjusted and the buckle of your stirrup leathers pulled up to the stirrup bar.
Ride as usual for at least an hour.
CHECK YOUR GIRTH FREQUENTLY!,
When you have completed the ride.
Lightly treat the underside of the saddle as above.
You can work the billets with a glycerin wash. Knead the glycerin in until they become more pliable.
Buff the top leather with a soft flannel cloth.
Allow the saddle to sit for 2 to 3 days before putting into use.

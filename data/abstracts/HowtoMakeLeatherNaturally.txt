Start by setting up a work area for yourself, preferably outdoors or in a well-ventilated, easily cleaned indoor area.
Soak the hide in a bucket of water overnight to make it more pliable.
Carefully scrape the flesh off the skin using a very sharp convex blade or drawknife.
Once clean, the hide must be de-haired.
By now the hide looks clean, but is still covered in protective layers, a membrane on the flesh side and the epidermis on the fur side.
Finally, the hide is ready to be tanned.
The final part of the process, currying, is turning the preserved but rough and poorly-colored skin into a polished final product.
At this stage, the leather can be smoked suspended over a fire of greenwood.
Either way, the leather is finished by rubbing oil into the surface and giving it a final round of sleaking.

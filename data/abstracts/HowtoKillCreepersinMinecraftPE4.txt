Craft a bow out of a stick and some woolen string (from spiders).
Craft some bows out of a feather and a stick or collect them from skeletons.
Stand at a very long distance from the creeper but close enough so that you can still see it.
Have a shot at the creeper.
Back away a bit, now, as the creeper will be coming towards you.
Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the creeper is dead.

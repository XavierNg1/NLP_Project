Round up the wood needed to build the rack.
Ensure that you have all of the necessary equipment and supplies.
Use your saw to cut your two 1x4 boards into shape.
Cut the 2x4 down to three separate pieces.
Use an old coffee can, or similarly round object, to trace a rounded edge on the end of the three 2x4s.
Clamp the 2x4 to the workbench, then use a jigsaw to cut along your curved line.
Measure and mark one of the 30" boards with the following measurements.
Mark each one of your measurements 2" from the edge.
Using a 3/8-inch bit, drill a hole at each 2" mark.
Draw a straight line along each side of the drill holes.
Use the jigsaw to cut up from the edge to your drill hole, following the lines you drew.
Place the 27" board between the two rounded 11" 2x4s.
Adhere all three 2x4s to the 27" long base.
Attach the three of the 30" 1x4s to form the back of the wine rack.
Attach another of the 30" boards on the front of the rack, right at the bottom.
Glue the entire underside of the two tiny 2" boards.
Attach the notched wine glass holder to the two feet.
Let everything dry, then sand and stain.
Measure the distance between two studs in the wall you're installing the rack on.
Drill pilot holes in the center of your rack, placing them the same distance apart as your studs.
Use 3-inch wood screws to attach the rack to the studs in the wall.

Know that (usually) the left hand takes care of playing chords using arpeggio, called broken chords, or the usual unified chords for the left hand to play for tenor and bass notes in the scale while the right hand is usually playing the melody and/or alto part(s)...;
,
Find the key; so for example, C major is the easiest; it is called the common key/common chord.
Figure out the notes of the melody.
Suppose you have notes G and C in the melody and the song is in the "key of G Major," try playing a C Major chord (C-E-G) arpeggiated and try a G Major chord (G-B-D) arpeggio (breaking the chords).
Find chords in the major scales as the I-IV-V: that means the Tonic(I), the sub-dominant(IV), and the Dominant(V) based on circle of notes of the key of the song.
Write the chords (when they are decided upon) above the words using the most common chord progressions.
Include these progressions which are commonly used: I IV V I -- I vi IV V -- I ii IV V -- vi IV I V -- I V vi iii IV I ii V where each numeral means to use the chords named by the notes in that key's "circle of notes" with the "tonic" as 1st (I) "doh" of the key on up to the (VII) 7th and then "recycle.",
Play chords in normal order, low to high: like "C-E-G", generally -- and then when it is necessary to consider changing the chord (consider usual chord progressions).
Use that C chord inversions (which are not in order low to high) to use when the chords on the song do not change, but then you can have a slightly different sound by the inversions.
Understand that if the lower notes B through D are used in the melody, then the fundamental or root position of the C chord would be used.
Do you want to write your melody although you may not read music well.

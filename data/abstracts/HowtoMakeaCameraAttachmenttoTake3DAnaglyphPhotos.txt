Before you start, take a look at the photos on the following website to get an idea of the steps.
Gather the supplies listed below.

,Print the template from www.gibbondesign.com/anaglyph.pdf onto a sheet of A4 size paper (you can also print it on 8.5‿ x 11‿ paper and scale it to the correct size using the dimensions on the paper)

,
Use this template to cut the walls out the mat board.
Tape the filter material to the rectangular windows.
Tape the template (double sided tape works well) for the inner and outer boards on the fiberboard and use a jigsaw to cut these pieces.
If you want a sturdier device, you can place 76mm standoffs between the fiberboard pieces.
Now it’s time for the assembly.
Position the wall panels around the assembly.
Now it’s time to take some photos.

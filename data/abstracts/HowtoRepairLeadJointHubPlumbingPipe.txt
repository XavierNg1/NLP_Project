Remove the lead and oakum in the leaking joint.
Remove ALL of the material from the joint.
Once the joint is properly prepared (clean and dry, with no residual 'stuff'), fill it with oakum (a tarry hemp fiber), which is packed into the space between bell and spigot using steel instruments called 'caulking irons.',
Fill the last space.
Every joint must consist of one inch of lead, all poured at once.

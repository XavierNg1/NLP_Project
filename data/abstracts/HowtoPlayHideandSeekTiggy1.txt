Much like hide and seek, you need to choose an "it" person and the people who will hide.
If you are the "it" person, you probably already know what to do after choosing the players and what their role is for the game, hiding or seeking.
When the "it" person is done counting, they must call out, "Ready or not, here I come!",
The "it" person must find someone.
You become "it" after being tagged by the "it" person.
Continually play as long as you want.

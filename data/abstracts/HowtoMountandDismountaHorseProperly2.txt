Avoid dismounting your horse facing towards his home.
Take both your feet out of your stirrups.
Swing your right leg over your horse's hind quarters.
Slide down with bent legs.
Roll up your stirrup on the left side first.
Remove your reins from over the horse's head.
If you have a running martingale, now is a good time to detach the rings of the martingale from the reins.

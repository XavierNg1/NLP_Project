Choose the style that you'd like to have.
Be sure to "study" the hair very closely.
Make sure that you have all the materials you need.
If you're going to cut your hair, be POSITIVE that you're sure you want to do it.
After you're done with cutting your hair (if you've cut it), now the next step, dyeing it.
After you're done with dyeing it, and you've waited (for your hair to dry, or just a couple of days), straighten it with a flat iron before you style it.

Visual kei hair is mostly hair that stands out a lot, sometimes to extremes.

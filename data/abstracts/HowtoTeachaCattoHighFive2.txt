Sit on the floor facing your cat, with a bowl or dish between you.
Present a treat to your cat at about shoulder height while saying “high five.” If you cat goes for the treat with its mouth, or does nothing, withdraw your hand and treat, wait five seconds, then try again.
“Click + treat” as soon as your cat extends a paw in any manner toward you or the treat.
Repeat the process until your cat only uses its paw to reach the treat.
Begin to reward your cat only when it makes contact with your hand.
Remove the treat from the process once your cat consistently reaches with a paw.
Switch your hand into a “high five” position, palm facing the cat at about eye level.
Start practicing from different angles once your cat masters the motion.

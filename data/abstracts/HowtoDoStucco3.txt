Spread some stucco on a sheet of plywood to experiment with the kind of texture you would like to create.
Prep your wall to receive the stucco.
Apply the scratch coat of stucco using a trowel and a hawk, if necessary.
Apply the second coat, also known as the brown coat or leveling coat.
Go over the brown coat with a darbie or feather edge to smooth it.
Apply the finish coat, texturing or "floating" the stucco as desired.

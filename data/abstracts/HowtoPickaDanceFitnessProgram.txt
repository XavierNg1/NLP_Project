Decide what music most motivates you.
Decide why you want to do a dance fitness class.
How do you learn best?,
Ask your friends whether they go to any dance fitness classes, any they have enjoyed or any they haven't.
Choose a style and class which ticks as many of the boxes above.
Once you have decided on a style and format, contact the teacher.
Ask the teacher whether they do offer classes for beginners, is there a good time to start the lesson, do they teach a routine and if so is it therefore best you start at a certain date.

,
Check your teachers credentials, have they been teaching for a while.
Don't splash out on all the latest fancy gear straight away, check with the teacher what you will need to wear/bring for your first trial and if you like it ask them the best place they recommend for shoes or equipment.
Diarise your first class, look forward to it and dance your way to fitness!

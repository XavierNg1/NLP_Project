Go to your local party supply store and buy a few helium balloons.
Write the note you want to send on the piece of paper.
Fold up the piece of paper and hole punch it.
Tie the fishing line or string around the already tied mouth of the balloon and through the hole punch.
Go outside (preferably on a windy day), and let the note float away into the sky.

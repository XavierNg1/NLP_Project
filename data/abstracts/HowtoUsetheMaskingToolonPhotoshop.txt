Open the image you would like to change the background on.
To convert the image to a layer, right click on it and click ‘Layer From Background’.

,
Duplicate the layer by pressing Ctrl+J so you have three versions of the image (This is so you don’t lose the original if you go wrong).
Make your changes.
Make the top layer visible again so you can make the changes.
Wait for a white box to pop up next to the selected layer.

,
Reveal the background from the middle layer.
Flatten the image, if you're done.
Enjoy your image and keep up the good work!

Be prepared by learning as much as you can about the part you are auditioning for.
Make sure that you are qualified for the role as well as the position as an actor.
Ensure that your resume and head shot are professionally produced and up-to-date.
Continue to build upon your experience and resume so that you have more to offer as an experienced actor because auditions are similar to job interviews.
Arrive early, if not on time, just in case you are expected to work from their script.
Don't allow your wardrobe to steal the show.
Be confident when you enter the audition room, but don't allow yourself to become arrogant.
Demonstrate an interest in the part by asking a few questions.
Strive to leave a positive impression without trying to shock the casting directors or beg for the role.

Play until everyone is ‘out.’ When you are tagged, you must go to “jail,” a specified location where all the people who are ‘out’ must wait until everyone else has been tagged by the person who is ‘it.’Once you are ‘out,’ you can no longer participate in the game, but watching and cheering from the sidelines is also fun!,
Restart the game.

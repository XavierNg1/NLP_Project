Consider whether both of you talk about big things before they happen.
Check your own confidence levels.
Note your own blinkered vision towards this person.
Consider the extent of sacrifices you've made for this relationship.
Watch for deliberate withdrawal of affection or intimacy.
Beware the constant mood swings.

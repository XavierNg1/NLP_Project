Do not acknowledge the debt.
Don't fall for any traps.
Get it in writing.
Check the statute of limitations to make sure you're not responsible for the debt anymore.
Write a letter explaining that you are not responsible for the debt, you do NOT acknowledge it, and you demand they stop harassing you or you will take legal action.
Watch your credit report carefully.

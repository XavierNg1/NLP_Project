Stomp your anger into the ground while you walk.
Feel your sadness.
Rotate your shoulders.
Rotate your spine.
Allow a healing color to trickle through your body from head to foot.
Concentrate as you walk connected to the ground.
Move one hand and send someone a positive sentence.
Imagine the numbers 1 to 20 in your head, chest, abdomen, legs, feet, and into the ground (beneath the feet).
Visualize a beautiful sun in the sky and clothe yourself with a golden ray of sunshine.
Stop all thoughts.
Walk freely.

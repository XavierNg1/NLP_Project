Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F (220ยบ C).
Cut six tablespoons butter into small squares and freeze them for 5-10 minutes.
Measure out your dry ingredients as the butter is freezing.
Cut the cold butter into the flour using your favorite method, aiming for a crumbly consistency.
Create a "well" or hole in the flour mixture and pour in the cold buttermilk.
Gently fold the buttermilk until you have a shaggy wet dough.
Lay dough out on a well-floured work surface.
Using your fingers or a rolling pin, gently spread the dough out until it is roughly a 1/2-inch thick.
Fold the dough in half, then again spread it until it is roughly 1/2-inch thick.
Repeat this folding and flattening 4-6 more times.
Using the lip of a glass cup, cut the dough into individual rounds.
Lightly re-flatten any excess dough, fold & flatten it once more, and then make the last few biscuits.
Place the biscuits on a lightly floured or buttered baking sheet or dish.
Optionally, drizzle some melted butter on top of each biscuit before cooking.
Cook the biscuits for 10-12 minutes.
Remove the biscuits from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 2-3 minutes before serving.
Finished.

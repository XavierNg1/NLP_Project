Purchase a harness and leash.
After getting a harness you can put it on your cat.
Be patient.
Practise inside the house, then in your back garden/yard.
When you're both ready to go for your walk, attach the harness and leash to the cat and let your cat get used to being outside.
Pace around with your cat for a while, until he or she is ready to walk.

,
Be careful that your cat doesn't come to harm from dangers such as traffic or dogs.
Have fun taking your new walking buddy around!

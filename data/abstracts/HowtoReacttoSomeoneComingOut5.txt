Don't let it change your relationship.
Laugh at their jokes regarding their orientation, like "I'm about as straight as my parking job!",
Be comfortable talking to them about their struggles coming out, expressing themselves, or being unaccepted.
If they find a romantic partner, be happy for themâ€”just like you would be happy for a straight person who found a partner.

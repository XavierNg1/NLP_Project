Obtain a suitable drill to use for the project.
Locate the place where you need to drill your hole.
Use a center punch where it is practical to dimple the material you are going to drill.
Try drilling a pilot hole with a small diameter bit.
Attach a guide jig to the surface if the pilot bit doesn't bite and begin cutting without slipping.
Use a drill press to drill precise holes if you have one available.
Practice the technique you select on scrap stock or material if you need precise results, and remember, working slowly and supporting the material will make your job easier.

Enlist the help of an experienced spotter or you might get hurt.
Prepare with exercises to strengthen your form.
Run forward at a moderate speed.
After gaining a suitable amount of speed, take a small hopping jump and land with both your feet planted firmly.
Jump into the air from your planted position, push your arms up and forward then bring your arms down to meet your legs, pulling your knees into your chest in a tight, tucked position to create more rotation.
Pull your knees to your chest and tuck your body into a ball so that you'll rotate the entire 360 degrees.
Untuck from the ball as soon as you feel yourself becoming right-side-up in the air.
Land with your feet spread the same distance as before, about the same as your shoulders.

Hit the shower.
Once you dry off (and apply deodorant), take a look in the mirror.

,
Get out the grooming kit (every guy should have one).
Make sure your nails are trimmed and have no dirt underneath them.

,
And before you start on your wardrobe, BRUSH YOUR TEETH!,
Carry some mints or gum with you, especially if a dinner is on tonight's agenda.

,
If you have enough room in your pockets, it won't hurt to take a pocket comb along (not only do girls think it's funny, but your hair may not behave itself throughout the night).

,
Douse on some cologne or body spray if you get down like that (some guys don't), but go easy!

,
Take care of your clothes.
Make sure your shirt has no threads hanging off it.

,
Don't wear shorts.
Make sure your tongues aren't sticking out from the bottom of your pants, either.

,
Pick out a nice shirt.
Wear something that complements.
Try a hemp necklace or bracelet instead, if you feel comfortable.

,
Cuff links always add a dash of flair to your shirt, but know how far too go with these, as they can be catalysts for tackiness.

,
A nice watch is always a good call, but don't go digital.
Don't wear rings, or at least, don't overdo them.
Take a last look in the mirror.
Have a friend look you over, if possible.

,
Make sure your hands and teeth are clean, practice smiling in the mirror, and be sure to walk out there with a good posture.

,
Don't look at the ground or hunch over while you're walking.

,
Walk straight up, chest out a little, shoulders back, and take moderately long but slow strides, like you're Somebody.
Finished.

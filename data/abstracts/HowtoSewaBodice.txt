One of the most important items in the construction of a bodice is the fit and location of required darts.
At this point, many patterns will require that if there is a lining, you would repeat the same thing for the lining.
If a lining is not used but a facing is used for neck and arms, this is where you will be working on those pieces.
Most blouses call for side seams then sleeves, but sleeves can be fit into armholes prior to sewing side seams.
Now if this is the end of your blouse, all that is left is the finish work of hem, buttons, hook and eye or whatever is called for.
If you are attaching your bodice to a lower portion (skirt or pant) of the pattern this is where you will make sure that the waistline is as perfect as you can get it.
Other than jewels, nothing makes a girl feel prettier than a nice fitting garment.

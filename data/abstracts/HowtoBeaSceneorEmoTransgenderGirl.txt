Get the right bra.
Before you start with fake breasts, measure yourself very tightly (though still with room to breathe) around your chest, add 2 to this number, and add another 1 if it's an odd number.
Disguise your crotch.
Figure out what to do with your hair.
Find a top you like.
Flaunt your scene style but in a feminine way.
Spend some time shopping to find the right pants.
Put on that makeup!,
Never forget the accessories!,
Consider getting pierced.
Before getting a tattoo, realize it's permanent.
Show who you are.
Love yourself!

Ensure you have the correct replacement tile as there are many different roof tiles on the market.
Get onto the roof.
Once you have safely gotten to the broken tile, you'll need to slightly lift the tiles that overlap the one to be removed.
Place your new tile onto the brick trowel and reverse the steps for removing the tile.
Ensure the tile is securely in place and is not interfering with any other tiles around it.
Have a quick check across the roof while you're there to survey any other potential damage.

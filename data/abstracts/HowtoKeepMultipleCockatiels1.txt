Assure that birds are disease free.
Keep the birds in individual cages at first.
Introduce your birds to each other when they are young, if possible.
Introduce the birds outside of their cages.
Put cockatiels together in the same cage only if they get along.
Consider keeping your birds in separate cages permanently.

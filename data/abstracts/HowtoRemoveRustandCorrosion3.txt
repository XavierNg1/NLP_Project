Obtain a power grinder or sander if you donâ€™t own one already.
Fit the grinder with the coarsest disc available.
Secure the rusted material so that it will not move when you grind away the rust.
Turn on the power grinder and brush the rotating disc against the rust gently but firmly.
Use a power sander to finish the rust off.

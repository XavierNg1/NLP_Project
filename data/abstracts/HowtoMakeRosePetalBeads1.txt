Gather red rose petals.
Place on a rusty tin sheet in the sun for a day or so to begin to dry.
Wait for the petals to shrink before proceeding but not dry.
Put the petals through a mincer or through a blender until there is a mince of roses that appears ideal for forming into beads.
Using your hands, roll small bead shapes with a bit of the mixture.
Pierce a hole through the centre of each bead.
Allow the beads to dry thoroughly.
Thread the necklace.
Add an appropriate clasp.

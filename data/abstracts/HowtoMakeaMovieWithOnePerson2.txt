Focus on telling your story or idea visually.
Make a storyboard of your film.
Use an external mic instead of the camera microphone.
Shoot in short bursts, not long single takes, when getting lots of footage.
Stay in one place if you are filming yourself.
Get 3-5 times the footage you think you need.

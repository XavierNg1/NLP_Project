Make sure you have a good camera that has good sound quality and a good picture.
You should definitely be using a webkinz for your videos!,
Use a voice that's not scratchy or extremely deep.
Do something interesting in your videos.
Do some funny videos, or something that has your webkinz acting something out, not just yourself talking with a webkinz in front of the camera, but make sure it's not copying anybody else!

Remember that the amount of light that hits the film (or digital chip) depends on 3 variables:


Shutter speed (5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 meaning one fifth, one tenth...one thousandth of a second)
Aperture.
Know that those listed numbers roughly correspond to doubling or halving the amount of light.
Understand that the aperture stops change by a factor of square root of 2 (1.4) because they indicate the diameter of the lens opening, and increasing the diameter by 1.4 actually doubles the opening area, thus doubling the amount of light that goes in.
Now to figure out the lighting conditions:


Set the shutter speed roughly equal to the ISO

for example, if your film is ISO 400, set the shutter to ~400 (300-500 is fine)


The aperture can then be set based on the following rule:

Bright sunny day - f 16
Heavy overcast - f 8
Sunset/thick shade - f 4
Brightly lit indoors with some window light - f 2 (e.g.
Photograph.
Extrapolate.
Study and remember.

If your guitar is fresh out of a music store, gently remove the strings it originally came with by untying the knots.
If your guitar didn't come with any strings, purchase a pack of six strings.
String your guitar.
To tie the string, slip it through the small opening in the tuning peg that the string is for, and wind it around the bar the hole is attached to.
Do the same at the bottom of the guitar, but pull this one a little tighter.
Repeat for all the strings, then break out the tuner to tune the new strings to the desired pitch.

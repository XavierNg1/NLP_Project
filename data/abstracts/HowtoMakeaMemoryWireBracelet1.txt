Measure out at least three coils of memory wire, add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters), and cut it using a pair of wire cutters.
Use your round-nose plies to make a small loop at one end of the wire.
Thread your beads onto the wire, leaving a Â½ inch (1.27 centimeter) tail.
Fold the tail end of the wire into another loop.
Consider adding a charm using a jump ring.
Finished.

Install aquarium tank, base, and lighting: Set up a mid-size to larger sized aquarium such as 50 gallons to 150 gallons (200 liters to 560 liters).
Install rocks, gravel, and synthetic sea water.
Build or Install a wet-dry filter for biological filtration that has a volume of 1 gallon per 50 gallons of aquarium (3.78 liters per 190 liters of aquarium volume).
Install a medium to large sized canister filter with a high flow rate; some have a built-in UV sterilizer which may be helpful.
After one month of running the aquarium with biological filter, you can add new fish, at a rate of about one fish per month; each time also add an anti-parasitic agent, and use the aquarium divider for three days.
Add top-off dechlorinated fresh water as needed to maintain the aquarium water level.
Give vitamins to the fishes: Soak fish food in vitamins before feeding, a few times per week.
Increase the mechanical filtration by installing several powerheads with sponge filters inside the aquarium, and every week remove, rinse, and re-install the sponges.
Use a nitrate and phosphate reduction system that is carbon-dosing based, together with a protein skimmer.
Add a bacterial clean-up additive weekly.
Add buffer to the aquarium weekly by first mixing it with top-off water.
Add a small amount of a mild herbal anti-parasitic agent weekly.
After the third month from initial set up, and then once per month, move only half of the rocks and stir up only half gravel of the aquarium, let the water settle, and after 10 minutes remove, rinse, and replace the sponges on the powerheads, and lastly replace the rocks.

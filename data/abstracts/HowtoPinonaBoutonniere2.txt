Figure out where to position the boutonniere.
Pinch the fabric of the shirt between your fingers of your non-dominant hand and slide the pin through with your dominant hand.
Slide the stem of the boutonniere between the shirt and the pin.
Pinch the unpinned fabric on the other side of the boutonniere stem and push the pin all the way through.
Stretch the shirt so that the fabric you pinned together lays flat against the chest.

Acknowledge your surroundings.
To start, after assessing your environment, is to figure out which methods will be the best to learn/study in this environment.
Next, you must prepare yourself for the learning ahead by getting trivial disturbances out of your way.
Now that your important and trivial, bodily, disturbances have been taken care of, it's time to begin the process of readying your brain for learning.
PREPARATION PHASE: To begin focusing in on these snapshots, you must remove all disturbances from your area of study.
You need to blank out your mind and body of concerns.
Now onto the learning.
LEARNING PHASE: Now, gather your learning materials in front of you, and begin reading/learning.
RE-ITERATION PHASE: Every 15 minutes, stop and practice what you've just learned (or if this is impossible, go back and re-read only the most important parts of the article/topic).

,
RETAINMENT PHASE: Then, once you have done the re-iteration step, get up and take a quick jog or a fast walk, or anything that will make your mind remember the information.
RE-DO PHASE: Once you have finished the "retainment" phase, relax yourself and repeat the processes starting at the "LEARNING PHASE".
If you follow these steps to the line, and use your best judgement, you will succeed in learning your topic.

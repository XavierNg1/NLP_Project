Plan a timetable.
Talk to your parents.
Reward yourself.
If you have tutors, as soon as you come home, do one bit of his/hers homework.
If you can, set a reasonable amount of time on weekends and in the holidays where you can revise and do some more homework.
Stay positive.
Relax!,
Don't have a late night!,
If you have to go out, either wait until you have done a fair amount of work or do it another day.

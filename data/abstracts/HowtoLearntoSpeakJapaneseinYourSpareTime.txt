Make sure that Japanese is really for you, and that you are dedicated to the learning process.
Understand that the first thing that all Japanese students should try to do is establish a slight understanding of what exactly is ahead of them.
Use the tools that you have to supplement your learning.
Buy simple, easy to use resource materials (see reading list at the end of this article).
If possible, take up a Japanese friend.
Practice, and practice more.
Again, if you are capable of doing so, try to adopt a Japanese accent, people in Japan will view you as more native.
Practice writing on an erasable surface, there is no need to waste paper.
Create a schedule that conforms to your daily activities.
Never give up, even if you become frustrated.

Purchase or rent a large wet saw with a diamond blade.
Ensure you have a water supply and check the water pump on the saw.
Mark the marble with tape or china marker for your cutting guidelines.

,
Place the marble on the wet saw so most of the block is supported.
Feed the marble to the saw slowly and let the blade do the work for you.
Push the marble between the blade and the fence until the marble has completely cleared the blade.








,
Use a small diamond blade saw or a grinder with a diamond wheel to clean up jagged edges of the newly cut marble.
Clean up your work area and throw away marble scraps.

Before you go on any websites or look at any cars, do your research.
Look at different websites that offer different cars.
By the time you reach this step, it is expected that you have found a secure, safe website that you trust and are willing to buy a car from.
Once you have picked out the right car, enter your credit card information and fill out any other requirements the website asks of you.
After the step above has been completed, the website will ask you to pay the tax, and it can be expensive.

Gather clear elastic cord, glue, and beads of various sizes and shapes.
Begin stringing beads along the cord.
Tie the elastic once or twice.
Glue the knot once the bracelet is the correct size.
Clip off the ends of the string once the glue is dry.
To stim, place the bracelet around one thumb and loosely close your fist around it.

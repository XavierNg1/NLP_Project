Visit IKEA to purchase the frame.
Use the wire basket as support for the 25 liter (6.6 US gal) plastic container that will house the growbed.
If you want to personalize the system to fit in with your home décor, now is a good time to do it.
Use a small 600 lph (litres per hour) electric submersible pump in one corner of the fish tank which takes the water up to the growbed.
Obtain male and female threaded adapters.
Place the male adapter through the top of the growbed.
Observe the 25mm-13mm reducer on the far left of the photo shown below.
Place the 60mm bell siphon in the middle.
Finally, the 100mm media guard, shown on the far right, is simply to keep the growbed media out of the bell siphon.
Bell siphons can be tricky to get working.
Add the ball-valve by-pass.
Once you have all the framework, the containers, and the plumbing set up, add water into the fish tank and start the pump up.
Fill the top container (the growbed) with some sort of growing media.
Once this has been done, you are ready to add the fish and to start putting plants into your system.

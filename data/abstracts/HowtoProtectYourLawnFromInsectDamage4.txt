Use pesticides only after you have tried natural approaches.
Look for an organic pesticide containing "bacillus thuringiensis" before trying more toxic chemicals.
Wear long sleeves, long pants, safety goggles and rubber gloves when mixing pesticides.
Use a lawn spreader to distribute granules around the yard.
Spray the lawn with water from a garden hose after you have applied the chemicals.
Keep children and pets off the lawn until the insecticide indicates it is safe.
Rinse out the containers on the lawn, immediately after you treat it.

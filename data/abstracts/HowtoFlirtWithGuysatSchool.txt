Be conscious of your appearance.
Groom yourself to look more beautiful.
Give him the opportunity to approach you.
Ensure that you are sitting or standing alone for at least some time, so that he can approach you easily.
Remember that actions are powerful.
Start conversations.
Get to know him.
Lastly, if he's interested in you, don't just go immediately to be "best friends" or "boyfriend and girlfriend".

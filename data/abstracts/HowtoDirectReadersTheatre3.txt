Get everything ready.
Consider using short stories for creating your scripts as with books, to make a series of plays to create a diversity of roles for the people who turn up; this will also allow you to place people into different groups by story.
Get your practice place ready.
Keep a list of people who have said they'll come and any details such as email contact or phone number.
Meet the first day: Start the theatre, having the scripts handy, along with the extras for unexpected participants and for those who forget.
Once everyone has had a chance to audition, give each of them their script with their name marked on it.
Decide which play you're going to practice first (if you have more than one).

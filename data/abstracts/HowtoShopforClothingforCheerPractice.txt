Keep your hair up.
Don't waste a whole lot of make-up for cheer practice.
Do NOT wear any blouse, OR regular bra.
Never wear jeans, jean-shorts, yoga pants, or any other material NOT made for sporting or outdoors.
Wear shoes that are made for cheer, because they are majorly light-weight and comfortable.

Take a cup or two of water and bring it to a boil on the stove.
Add a berry tea.
Take a few cinnamon sticks and crush them in a spice grinder.Leave the cinnamon and the hibiscus/berry tea on the stove at a boil for about 5 to 10 minutes.
Set your stove on the lowest setting and add a few large tablespoons of raw honey.
Check the water content of the mixture at this point.
Let the solution simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.
Turn off the stove and let the mixture cool for 10 or 15 minutes.
Get your hands on a strainer and place it over the container (for this try and go for a narrower container, or strain the mixture into a cup and then pour into your chosen container).
This solution will keep so store in the fridge for a week or two if you need to.

Be familiar with the entire roster.
Choose a main, and one or two secondaries, tops.
Don't just practice offensive tech, practice defensive tech as well.
Improve your punish game.When you're fighting an actual person, pay close attention to him and study what he's doing, so that 1- you can predict every move as you fight, and so that 2- you won't fall for the same thing two or three times.Never stop trying to outwit your opponent, and do everything in response to what he will or will most likely do.
Consider what will happen before making any action.Practice making correct split-second guesses.
Be fast, and do not stop moving.Get grabs, and learn how to convert your best throws into big damage.Perfect your edge guard game.If you have a safe projectiles to use, take advantage, and also learn to combo from it if possible.When you take damage, it's because you did something wrong- so learn from every mistake.
Do not miss.
When you are at deathÂ %'s, focus twice as hard.
As a final tip- you are encouraged to watch videos and streams.

Gather your holography supplies and household materials listed in the "Things You'll Need" section below.
Define your laboratory space.
Prepare the subject of your hologram.
Prepare your diode laser (or laser pointer).
Position the laser until the subject is fully illuminated.

,
Turn off all lights.
Block the laser light from reaching the subject with a book.
Remove one holographic film plate from its box in the darkest part of the room.
Slowly lift the “shutter” slightly off the table a half inch (1cm) while still blocking the laser light from reaching any part of the plate, and wait a few seconds for any vibration to subside.

,
Lift the shutter all the way up to expose the holographic plate and object for about 10 seconds.

,
Block the laser light again by placing the book back on the table.

,
Process the plate according to instructions that accompany the holography processing kit.
Dry the holographic plate vertically.
View your hologram after it is completely dried with a point source such as that from a projector, flashlight, spotlight, LED white light, or the sun.

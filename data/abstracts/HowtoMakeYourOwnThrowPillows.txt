First, you are going to want something soft.
Measure out the size of fabric.
Lay the two pieces of fabric so that the color/design/patterns are facing the outside(like how you imagine the pillow to look like).
Tie double-knots with the bottom & top sections of each strip so that you end up with a fringe around the pillow.
Stuff the pillow with stuffing, or scrap pieces of fabric.

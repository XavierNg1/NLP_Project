Use a chimney starter for an even, strong fire with minimal effort.
Place 2-4 pieces of lightly scrunched newspaper in the bottom of the starter.
Fill the top of the chimney with charcoal briquets or wood chips.
Light the paper from the bottom in 2-3 places.
Dump the coals on the grill the top pieces are covered in gray/white ash.
Make sure the vents are open for a larger fire.
Open the bottom vents of your grill and remove the cooking grate.
Form a "pyramid" of charcoal briquettes, with the peak in the center of the grill.
Squirt a small amount of lighter fluid in the center of your pyramid.
Let the briquettes with lighter fluid soak for 2-3 minutes.
Apply a thin second layer of lighter fluid.
Light the fire safely with a long match or electric lighter.
Spread the briquettes out once they are mostly covered in gray/white ash.
Seal up any unused briquets for next time.

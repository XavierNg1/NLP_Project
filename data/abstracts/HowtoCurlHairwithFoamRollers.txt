Shampoo and condition your hair as usual.
Towel dry your hair.
Blow (or air) dry with care, until your hair loses about half of its moisture.
Roll the bangs first.
Divide the rest of your hair into five sections: top, sides and two in the back.
Start rolling the top section.
Roll hair on the sides, then the back of your head.
Prevent outer curls from getting unsightly top crimps or dents.
In the morning, unsnap each roller and gently remove it.
If desired, use hairspray to set your fabulous new â€™do!

Check your look in the mirror, then you're all set.

Choose a suitable place to paint.
Before painting a part, make sure it is clean and dry.
Ensure that the paint you are about to use is mixed to a thorough consistency.
It may become necessary to mask adjacent parts from the part you wish to paint, so as not to accidentally get paint on that part.
When painting with a brush, always ensure that it is of appropriate size and that there are no loose or stray bristles.
You should always follow the published instructions included with your airbrush, but some key points to especially remember are to keep you airbrush perpendicular and of fixed distance from your work, and to paint in one direction only (unless painting camouflage patterns).
Dry brushing is a technique which employs only a small amount of paint, usually to achieve the effect of weathering.
After painting, it may become apparent that some paint needs to be removed, whether it holds dust, has found its way onto an adjacent part, or simply is the wrong colour.

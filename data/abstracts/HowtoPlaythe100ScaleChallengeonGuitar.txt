Pick a scale you feel comfortable with to start your challenge.
Play down the scale as cleanly as possible.
Play back up the scale to complete one rep. Guitarists must play down the scale just as often as they play up it, so don't consider one of your 100 reps done until you've made it cleanly back up the scale.
Work your way up to 100 reps, playing as many as you can without pain.
Dive into the 100 Scale Challenge at the end of your practice sessions.
Add legato notes into your scales to improve speed and skills.
Move your scale up and down the neck as you practice.
Focus on keeping your muscles relaxed when you get tired.
Use a metronome to help keep time and measure progress.
Incorporate new scales, including scales you don't quite know yet, to grow as a lead guitarist.

Determine which method is the most desirable: direct burial of cable under soil, PVC electrical pipe (PVC) buried under soil with conductors installed in pipe, or aerial method.
Direct burial of type "UF" cable under soil is probably the most common and least expensive method.
After ensuring the minimum depth along the entire length, lay type "UF" cable in the trench.
UF cable must be supported every 30–36 inches (76.2–91.4 cm); just like NM cable.Do NOT backfill the trench until the electrical inspector or "authority having jurisdiction" (AHJ) has checked the work.
PVC pipe method allows for adding circuits at will without the labor or expense of excavating again.
A trench 18 inches (45.7 cm) deep minimum will be required for the pipe.Secure the pipe where it rises above ground at 30 to 36 inches (76.2 to 91.4 cm) intervals with approved supports for the pipe.Do NOT backfill the trench until the wiring inspector has checked your work.
A PVC "expansion joint" is often required between the point the pipe emerges from the ground outdoors and penetrates a wall or enters an enclosure mounted on the wall.
Push the "fish tape" or "snake" in one end of the pipe until it exits the opposite end.
Hook the conductors to the snake and tape together.
Aerial installations should only be done for short lateral runs, and where they may be installed so that traffic (vehicle or pedestrian) below will not create a hazard by contact.
Type UF cable is suitable for an aerial run when used with approved strain relief fittings because Type UF cable is rated as / and accepted to be sunlight & moisture resistant.

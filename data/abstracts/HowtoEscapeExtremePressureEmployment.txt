Come to grips with the fact that you can't take it anymore.
Believe, from deep in your gut, that you can do better.
Don't try to ignore your anger or frustration.
Focus whatever emotions you have.
Work out.
Hone yourself.
Go after attainable goals to better yourself.
Express your goals to your loved ones.
Every single day read number two above.

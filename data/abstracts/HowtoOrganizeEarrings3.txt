Paint a wooden box the color you want.
Cut several strips of felt that are the same length as the inside of your box.
Roll each piece of felt into a tight tube.
Pack all of the felt tubes into the bottom of the box.
Consider covering the tubes with a scrap of fabric for a more finished look.
Set your earrings in between the felt tubes.

Practice Inner acceptance.
Start with little things.
Give.
Stay Rooted in Being.
Recognize the interconnection between mind, emotions and body.
Experiment.
See the suchness of this moment.
Smile and laugh at it.
When you are stillness, what can you resist?,
Force your mind to surrender.
Enter 'now' from there.
Free yourself from all concepts.

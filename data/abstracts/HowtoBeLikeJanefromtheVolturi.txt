Walk with perfect balance and grace like any vampire would.
Hold your head up high to show you are not afraid of anything.
Look like you don't care about anything.
If you can, get dark red contacts to make the Jane look real.
Put some pale make-up on your face to get the vampire effect.
Wear dark, stylish clothes that look Victorian and vintage.
If you really want to look like Jane dye your hair blonde and keep it up in bun or ponytail.
When you get mad keep it in and don't start screaming.
Be sarcastic with dark humor like Jane in New Moon when she says, "This may hurt just a little."

Don't anger the Vampire.
Don't wander around alone.
Step away from people who come too close.
Don't follow people unless you're in a group.
If you're a Detective, don't go around waving your gun or announce that you're the detective; you may be the first target since the Vampire would want to get rid of the only person able to kill them.
Be aware of the signs that someone is a turned vampire.

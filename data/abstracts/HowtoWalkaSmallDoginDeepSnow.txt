Be sure it's necessary.
Consider alternatives.
Use your local weather channel or the internet to check to see if warmer weather may be on its way.
Plan to go when it's warmest.
Dress your small dog in a jacket and dog boots.
Pick a harness for your pup.
Check one more time for temperatures and black ice.
If you will be returning home after your walk, pop a few towels or a blanket in the dryer set on low.
If you must go on a walk at night, be aware that the snow might be frozen and there's a greater chance for ice.
Choose a good route.
Start your walk.
Walk slow.
Keep a close eye on your dog.
If he or she refuses to walk any further, don't make him or her.
Monitor your pet's winter wear.
Once your walk is over, proceed into the house immediately.
Take off the coat and boots, along with the leash and harness.
If you threw towels or blankets in the dryer, wrap your small dog up in them to warm it up.
Make sure there's food and water in your pet's dish.
Try to stay calm for the rest of the day.
Watch your dog for the first few hours after the walk.
Allow a time gap of a few days or up to a week before taking your dog out again.

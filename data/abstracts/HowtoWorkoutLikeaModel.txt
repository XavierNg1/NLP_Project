Rise and shine, Sally Sunshine!,
Start with slow cardio build-up.
Move all your muscles.
Take a long, cool drink.
Move your body!,
Once you’re done, wash your face with cool water, brush your teeth and start your day right!

,
Mid-day miracles DO happen!,
Stretch out once again.
Do as many crunches as you can.
Try some thigh-highs.
Let your body move freely.
Jump.
Stretch your body out again.
Finish your day with a flourish.
Stretch, but this time, only do it for a few seconds.
Raise your arms and jump up, with your arms up as if you were diving.
Now pretend that you’re swimming and let your body go.Make your abs tight, and your arms and legs loose, and just make as if you’re gliding through pearly clear water.
Do 50 crunches.
Stretch, drink some water, and revel.

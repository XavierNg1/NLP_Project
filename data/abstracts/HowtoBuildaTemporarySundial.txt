Clear a circular area of bare ground and place a stick (gnomon) in the center.
Find which way is north.
Draw a new circle as large as you want to make your sundial, with the center where your east-west and north-south lines meet.
Make a mark every 15 degrees on the circle (use a pebble).
Find your approximate latitude, you can look it up online, or one way to find latitude in the northern hemisphere is to determine how far above the horizon the north star (Polaris) lies.Extend a perpendicular line from the latitude stone to the north-south line

,
Draw an ellipse with the minor axis at this point, and the major axis where the circle intersects the east-west line.
Extend a line straight south or north from each 15 degree mark on the circle to the ellipse and place a pebble at the intersections.
Stand up a stick in the center of the circle.
Watch for a shadow to be cast, whatever number that shadow is cast on, that is your beginning to find out what time it is.

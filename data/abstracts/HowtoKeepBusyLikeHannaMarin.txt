Make sure you have a group of best friends to hang out or talk to when you feel like doing nothing.
Get into fashion.
Read stacks of magazines and collage fashion pictures.
Paint your nails!,
Talk to your mom.
If you can, get a boyfriend.
Last but not least, spend your time trying to look your best.

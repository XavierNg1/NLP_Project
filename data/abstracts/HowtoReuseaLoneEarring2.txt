Make jewelry from the orphaned earring.
Turn the earring into shoe jewelry.This requires an earring that has a hook attachment and dangles a long way down.To attach it, place the hook over the back of the shoe and tape well onto the shoe on the inside.You need to use enough tape to both hold it in place and prevent the hook from rubbing on your foot.
Make hair accessories from single earrings.

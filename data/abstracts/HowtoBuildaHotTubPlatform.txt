Decide where you want to place the platform.
Lay out a perfect 8 foot square at the location you plan to build the deck.
Wrap a string around the corner stakes and make two diagonal strings to locate the center.
Pound stakes at the center of each side (4' from the corner stake).
Now find the last four stakes by measuring 32" from two of your last four stakes as shown in the photo to the right.
Dig a 15" by 15" square hole at each of the inside nine stakes.
Fill the bottom 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6Â cm) of the hole with sand.
Flatten the sand with a square end shovel or a piece of plywood.
Place the footing on top of the sand with the straps aligned with the direction of the beams.
,
Wiggle the block until it is level in both directions.
Repeat this process with each hole and footing, making sure that the rows are aligned.
Tamp excavated soil into the holes around the footings compacting the ground so the footing can't move.
You should now have 9 footings in a 64" square in the middle of an 8' staked off square.
Set the center post first.
Place the "Post to Beam" ties on top of each post and nail through the holes provided.
Do the same with the other outside beam.
Recruit others to fill in the nail pattern for each beam holder and footing straps with galvanized 8d nails.
,
Toenail a 2" x 6" joist to each end of the beams.
Nail a rim joist to the ends of the joists and nail blocking down the center.
,
Mark the outside joists every 6.25" from each side.

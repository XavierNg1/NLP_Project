Choose the right stats.
Prepare your Spells Carefully: Wizards are highly limited in their volume of spells compared to all other classes.
Expand your Spellbook: Unlike sorcerers, wizards can know an unlimited number of spells, as long as they have enough spellbooks.
Cast Spells Cautiously: The wizard who casts spells at every opportunity is the wizard who dies first.
Use Scrolls Liberally: Scrolls are probably the best items in the game for wizards except for staffs.
Craft Magic Items: One advantage wizards have over sorcerers is that they are much better suited to crafting magic items.
Have Mundane Items: If you are out of spells, you will need to fight with hands.
Finished.

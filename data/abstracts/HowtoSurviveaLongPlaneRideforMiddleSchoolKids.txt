If you are traveling alone, you will be an "Unaccompanied Minor.",
Don't pack a huge carry-on bag.
Bring what you like, but don't make it huge and know your limits.
If your family's seats include an aisle seat, ask for that one.
Unless you're traveling first class, bring snacks in your bag, so you won't have to eat the airplane food.

,
Bring a sport bottle on the plane, and ask the flight attendants to fill it with water when they come around for meals or snacks.
Bring a fleecy pull-over, a sweater, or a light jacket.
If you have a portable DVD/MP3 player, by all means, use it!,
If you can't go to sleep in your seat, see if you can find another one.
Talk!,
Read a good book, You get to entertain yourself as well as you learn about new things, plus if its very interesting chances are time WILL fly by.

,
This might sound childish, but you should use your imagination.

,
And don't keep looking at how much time is left.

Forgive: We must not willfully hold anything against anyone, if we want to see the healing power of God, And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses (Mark 11:25).
Spend time in prayer: Jesus spent a lot of time talking to His Father (Luke 6:12)(Mark 1:35)(Luke 5:16).
Read the Bible.
Love proactively.
Hunger and thirst: Jesus said to hunger and thirst after righteousness, (Matthew 5:6) or His right ways, and we will be filled, and have those right ways happen in our lives.
Connect with other people.
Renew your mind.
Realize that healing is God's "will" (is available) for everyone.

Put what you've learnt into practice.
Go out and begin to talk to someone (Mark 16:15).
Pray.
Ask them to test if there is any difference (for example by moving their back if its a sore back).
Follow through.
If one is not healed, explain: Clarify that you are convinced that it is God's will to heal them and that you will continue to pray for them and if you have the opportunity you should also tell them about salvation,
Realize two reasons for prayers not being answered.
Overcome unbelief.
Recognise and eliminate traditions: Traditions are another reason prayer will not be heard.

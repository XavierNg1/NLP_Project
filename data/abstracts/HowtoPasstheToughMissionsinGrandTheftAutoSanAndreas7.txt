Use the Hunter (military helicopter) or Rhino (tank) if possible.
For the HPV-1000 (police motorcycle,) get a lot of ammo, and concentrate on keeping your distance from the cars.
Keep shooting the car until it blows up.
Use body armor, snacks / food, and police bribes to make it easier.
OPTIONAL: An excellent trick for the HPV-1000, Ranger, or police car, is to use the mini-gun.
Do them in Angel Pine.
If you stay close enough to the main pack, you can shoot them with the sniper rifle at the end of the race (*before* CJ finishes it,) and it will move CJ into first place.If there's a corona on the other side of the arena, just wait for a closer one to appear.
Release the accelerator to make quicker turns than your opponents.If you have to, ram through some cars to get to a corona nearby.
If possible, use the train tracks to get to your destination.
When not on the train tracks, try to stay off-road as much as possible.Lean forward as much as possible to gain as much speed as possible.
Hit the ramp, and before you land, lean the bike slightly forward, so the front wheel touches the ground first.

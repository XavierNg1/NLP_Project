Wearing gloves, soak the fabric in soda ash mixture for about ten minutes.
Place the fabric on a clean table with a plastic drop cloth or shower curtain on it.
Wearing gloves, on a drop cloth, starting with the lightest color, dye the fabric, use the bands to guide you, overlap your colors for mixing effect, use enough dye to soak the deepest fabric to get a unified pattern throughout the fabric.
Wait at least ten hours for the dye to set.
Rinse out as much dye as possible in a sink that will not stain.
Finished.

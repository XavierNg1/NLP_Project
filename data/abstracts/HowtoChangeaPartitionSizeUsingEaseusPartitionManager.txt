Download and install the EASEUS Partition Master (Free).
Once installed, run the program.
Depending on what partition you wish to change, the next steps may vary.
Right click on the F: drive, and choose Resize/Move partition.
Once the Resize/Move window is open, you can choose how much you would like to change the size of the partition.
Press OK, and you will now notice a small box of grey at the end of the drive, labelled Unallocated.

,
To add that space to the E: drive, you must first move the Unallocated space beside the E: drive.
Now that the Unallocated space is in the proper position, the E: drive can simply be dragged over until it meets the beginning of the F: drive, and all of the Unallocated space will be assigned to the E: drive.

,
You will notice on the left side of the screen, that there is a list of pending operations.
Once the resize has been completed, check your drives to make sure the new sizes are shown.

Understand that hamsters are “crepuscular.” Hamsters are commonly (though mistakenly) called “nocturnal,” when in fact they are “crepuscular.” Whereas nocturnal animals are most active at night, your hamster will be most active during twilight hours (dusk and dawn).
Track your hamster’s schedule.
Feed him at the same time each day.
Begin moving your feeding time back.
Be patient.

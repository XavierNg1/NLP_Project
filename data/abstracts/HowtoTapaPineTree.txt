Locate some mature pine trees that you can obtain access to.
Identify the best species of pines for this purpose.
Gather the necessary tools for your project.
Choose a tree to make your tap into.
Hack the bark away from the sap (live) wood about 3 foot (0.9 m) above the ground, and about 10 inches (25.4 cm) wide, by chopping the bark away with your machete, hatchet, or other chopping tool.
Fit your collecting bucket tightly to the sapwood, so that when the sap begins to seep out, it will drip into it.
Hack some shallow notches in a "V" shape, with the point of the "V" directly above the center of your bucket.

,
Leave the bucket attached to the tree until the sap begins to seep out and drain into it.
Remove any nails or other metal fasteners when you are finished your project and take down your collection pot.

Realize it's not your fault if someone doesn't love you.
Ponder the fact that most people who can't be loved have psychological and or emotional problems revolving around commitment and furthering interpersonal relationships.
You should limit the amount of time you see them to stop your feelings from running wild for this person.
Communication.
Try to forget keep-sakes and memories.
The hardest part of falling out-of-love with this person is that they're probably not going to want you to go.
Find a support group so you don't spend too much time in the same circle of friends.
Do your best not to stray.

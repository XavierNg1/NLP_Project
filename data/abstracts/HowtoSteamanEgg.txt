Tap the egg(s) all around with your fingernail.
Place in a small pot with 5 mm or 1/4" cold water.
Turn up the heat to maximum.
As soon as the water starts to "sing", turn off the heat (electric hotplate) or turn to minimum (gas).
As soon as steam comes out from under the lid, start the timer.
Enjoy.

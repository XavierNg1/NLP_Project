Get yourself a change jar that you want to use to put all of your spare change in.
Collect as much spare change you can find around your house, pockets, couch, etc.
Set up a time frame of how long you want to keep doing this for.
During whatever amount of period you decided to do this, make sure you don't touch any of it besides putting it into the jar.
Finally, a month had gone by.
Consider putting your spare change into a bank account.

Wash your jar, then wipe it down with some rubbing alcohol.
Cut a sheet of tissue paper large enough so that you can wrap it around your jar.
Coat the jar with Mod Podge.
Wrap the tissue paper around the jar, gently smoothing down any ripples or creases as you do so.
Smooth the tissue paper over the curved top and bottom edges of the jar.
Apply another coat of Mod Podge to the tissue paper.
Wait for the Mod Podge to dry.

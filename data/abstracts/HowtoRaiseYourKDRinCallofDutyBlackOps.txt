Diving is the stupidest move you can make, go prone or crouch for more accuracy.
Do not use the RPG.
Don’t try to quick scope.
If you find someone that is camping, look around for a Tactical Insertion, because chances are if you kill them they are going to respawn and kill you.

Don't spend the money on the Ballistic Knife or the Crossbow, they would be a waste of a secondary weapon.
Make sure your Killstreaks are within your skill level!

Give yourself at least 2 to 3 hours in which to prepare the wine.
Pour the wine, orange juice, and sugar into a large crockpot, and stir to combine.
Stud the orange with cloves.
Add the orange, cinnamon sticks, and cranberries into the crockpot.
Cook the wine on "low" for 2 to 3 hours.
Scoop out the orange and cinnamon sticks, then pour the mulled wine through a strainer into a large bowl or pot.
Carefully press the back of a spoon against the cranberries to get the juices out.
Pour the wine back into the crockpot, stir in the brandy, and give it a taste.
Heat up some mugs.
Ladle the wine into the mugs, then add some garnishes, of desired.

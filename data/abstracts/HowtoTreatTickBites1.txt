Grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible with a pair of tweezers.
Pull upward with firm, even force.
Pull out any remaining parts of the tick with tweezers.
Do not cover the tick in petroleum jelly or nail polish, or “coax” it out with heat.
Wash the bite thoroughly with soap and water.
Save the tick’s body for later identification.

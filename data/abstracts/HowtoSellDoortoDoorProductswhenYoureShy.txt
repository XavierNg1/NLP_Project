Try the “puppy dog” close.

Try the “assumptive close.” This technique works by acting as if the customer has already agreed to the sale, turning to the next questions: when they want the product, would they like it delivered, how they would like to pay, and so forth.Try moving slowly from the customer’s questions about the product into this technique, saying something like, “OK, how much money would you like to donate today?” “How many cases do you want to purchase?” or “When would you like us to deliver it?”
The assumptive close relies on the “assumptive principle,” where acting as if something is true makes it hard for the customer to deny it without feeling embarrassed.

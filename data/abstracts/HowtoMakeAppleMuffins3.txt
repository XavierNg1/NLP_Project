Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and lightly grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
Prepare the floured cinnamon apples.
Mix together the flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a medium-sized bowl.
Cream the butter and sugar in a separate bowl.
Stir the eggs into the butter mixture, one egg at a time, then add the vanilla extract.
Alternate between adding the flour mixture and the milk.
Fold in the floured cinnamon apples with a rubber spatula.
Fill the muffin cups ⅔ to ¾ of the way with the batter.
Bake the muffins for 20 to 25 minutes.
Let the muffins cool while you prepare the butter and cinnamon topping.
Take the muffins out of the tin, then dip them into the butter and cinnamon-sugar.
Set the muffins down onto a plate or wire cooling rack so that they can finish cooling off.

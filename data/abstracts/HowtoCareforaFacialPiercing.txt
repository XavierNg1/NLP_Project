First, decide what piercing you want.
After you get your piercing, make sure to listen to your piercer's advice.
On your way home from the piercing studio, stop by a supermarket and buy some pure non-iodized sea salt.
When showering or washing your face, be sure not to get shampoo, facial cleanser, etc.
Mix 1/4 teaspoons of sea salt into 8 ounces of water, or just pour the salt in and taste the water, if it is too salty, add water.
Use a Q-tip or cotton ball to clean around the piercing with the sea salt solution.
Use a clean paper towel to dry the area.

Now you are clean as a whistle with no infections!

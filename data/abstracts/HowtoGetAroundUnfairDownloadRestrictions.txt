1) You need to learn to use two network tools: ping and tracert (traceroute in linux).
In Windows, to use command line, you need to go to Start - run (0r cmd).
You will receive some information of this sort: "64 bytes from maa03s17-in-f7.1e100.net (74.125.236.199): icmp_req=1 ttl=48 time=329 ms"

,
Now: pay attention, - this is the tool you will use to your advantage.

,
2) The second tool needed is "tracert" in Windows or "traceroute" in Linux.
This time you will receive a bit more information.
Practice a bit on some innocent addresses, both ping and traceroute.

,3) The detective work.
Take the address that gives you a certain trouble regarding your downloads.
Now, start your download (or start watching video and such).
Note down the addresses of these offending nodes, for example:"0.ge-1-3-0.XT2.NYC9.ALTER.NET" - the whole thing, this is important.

,4) The repair stage.
Sometimes you can start doing this WHILE the download is happening.
Open the command line tool, and use the "ping" command.
NOW, WHILE DOING THIS - start your download or stream and such.

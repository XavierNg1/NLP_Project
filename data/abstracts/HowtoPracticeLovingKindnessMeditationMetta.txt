Settle in comfortably and close your eyes.
Take a moment now to understand the reason why you wish yourself happiness first.

After each person type, check again your posture and relax any tight spots.
Next, move on to the people you are acquainted with but don't count as a close friend or member of the previous group.
Next wish strangers and people you don't know the same happiness as you wished for the above groups.

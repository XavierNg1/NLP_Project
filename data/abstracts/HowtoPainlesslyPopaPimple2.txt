Use heat and moisture to remove pimples without popping.
Get a clean washcloth wet with the hottest water you can stand.
Press the hot washcloth against your pimple and hold it for 5-10 minutes.
Repeat every 1-2 hours, or until the pimple naturally pops.
Clean the pimple with anti-bacterial cream to prevent it from coming back.

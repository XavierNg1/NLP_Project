Stay relaxed and loose, even during intense solos.
Use dynamics, or changing volumes, to create tension.
Drop into different time signatures, or no time signature at all.
Practice to a metronome, especially if you want to play with "off-time" solos.
Continue practicing your rudiments, rolls, and rhythmic consistency to build technical skill.
Listen to soloists in any genre to pick up tips, tricks, and potential patterns.

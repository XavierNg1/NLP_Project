Choose a spot to hide your box.
Find a watertight container large enough to hold a logbook and stamp.
Put each letterbox item in a separate bag.
Make your own rubber stamp inspired by your hiding spot.
Unlined sketch pads are popular for letterbox logbook/journals.
Wrap your stamp in felt, fabric or a small amount of paper towel before placing it in its bag, this protects other items from residual ink.

,
Label your box that it is a "Letterbox" and possibly with info about the hobby.
Place the label inside a clear box so you can read it from the outside or insure the label won't wear off if placed on the outside.

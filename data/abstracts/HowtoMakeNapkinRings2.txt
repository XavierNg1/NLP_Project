Cover a cardboard tube with wax paper, and secure it at both ends with rubber bands.
Cut the burlap or lace ribbon.
Wrap the ribbon around the cardboard tube, and secure it with two sewing pins.
Apply Mod Podge, or a similar decoupage glue, over the fabric until it is completely saturated.
Stand the cardboard tubes upright, and wait for the glue to dry.
Take the napkin rings off of the cardboard tubes.
Let the napkin rings finish drying, if necessary.
Decorate the napkin rings further, if desired.

Mark your calendar.
Listen attentively to her.
Pay attention when she's around her friends.
Ask her what she wants.
Poke around on her Pinterest.
Address the state of your union.
Make your plan and prepare punctually.
Get a card, get flowers, or get both.
Know not just your gift, but where youâ€™re getting it from.
Survey your city.
Put the wallet away and pull out the picnic basket.
Mine your past for gifting gold.
Pebble their window at midnight.
Eyes off the cellphone.
Give gifts that are only for her.
Give gifts that could only come from you.
Get creative.

Be sure you know exactly the size of your foot.
Determine what kind of shoe you want to buy.
Enter what you are searching for into Google, Amazon, or your favorite search engine/shopping website.
Once you have found a shoe which appeals to you, look up the exact name of the shoe and read customer reviews.Customer reviews will be very useful, and something you do not necessarily get when shopping for shoes physically.
Compare prices for the same shoe from multiple websites.
If you have any concerns with the shoe, feel free to call or e-mail the company with questions.
Once you feel confident with your shoe choice, buy the shoe.

Layer your potatoes in a deep, heavy-bottomed pot.
Cover the potatoes with at least one full inch of your oil.
Cook for 15 minutes on medium heat.
Mix up the fries with a wooden spoon and cook for another 25 minutes.
Turn the heat to medium-high and cook until golden brown, about 20-30 minutes.
Drain fries on a rimmed baking sheet lined with paper towels and salt immediately.

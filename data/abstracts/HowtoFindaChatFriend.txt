First of all, use a SAFE WEBSITE to know people around the world who might be interested in being your friends.
Once you've found a website and met someone who might be a good friend, it's time to speak freely with that person.
Get to know your chat friend.
Don't make an attempt to add them on Facebook or any other such website that displays your personal information.
Don't be desperate and don't force them into anything.
Also, ask your parents if you're allowed to find a chat friend.
Be friendly, free, polite and a fun person with them.

,
Keep in touch with them regularly.
Keep to your principles and look for your comfort, too.Don't add someone who's ignorant but expects a lot from you.

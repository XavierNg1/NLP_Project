Assess the damage and material in need of repair.
Set up your small workshop on a table with ample space and light.
Position the necklace with the clasp end facing you.
Hold the jump ring between your fingers.
Remove both sides of the old clasp if it is damaged.
Assess where the hinge attaches.
Use a ball burr to grind off the head of the rivet where the hinge attaches with a wire.
Take the old spring to use as your pattern.
Choose a metal wire that fits through the bracelet's original divot holes.
Assemble the bracelet or necklace, placing the spring inside to make sure the sides fit together.

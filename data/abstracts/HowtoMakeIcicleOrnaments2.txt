Clean the bottle and remove the label.
Cut the top and bottom off of the bottle.
Cut the bottle, lengthwise, into thin strips.
Hold the plastic strip by each end, then hold it over a lighted candle.
Move the strip across the flame, twisting it while doing so.
Pull the icicle straight once you get to the other end, and wait until it cools.
Poke a hole through the top/flat part of the icicle with a heated needle or nail.
Pull some thread through the hole, then tie the ends into a loop.

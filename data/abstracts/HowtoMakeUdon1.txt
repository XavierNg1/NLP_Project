Sift the flour in a large bowl to remove any chunks.
Dissolve the salt in the hot water in a small bowl.
Make a small hole in the flour mixture and pour in half your water.
Continue adding the water slowly, tossing and mixing by hand until you have a shaggy dough.
Form a ball with the dough and place it in a gallon-sized plastic bag.
Using your whole foot, not just the heel, walk on the dough until flat.
Remove the dough from the bag, fold it into thirds, and place it back into the bag.
Let the dough rest in the bag for 4-6 hours.
Roll the dough into a rectangle.
Sprinkle the dough lightly with flour, and then fold it into thirds upon itself.
Slice across the short ends of the rectangle to make noodles.
Boil the noodles for 3-4 minutes in cold water, stirring regularly.
Drain the noodles and run immediately under cold water.

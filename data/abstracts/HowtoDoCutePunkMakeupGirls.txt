Think about how you're going to match the colours to your outfit.
Decide whether to use liquid or kohl eyeliner -- this choice could change your whole look.
Choose your colors.
Always start with a clean "canvas" by washing your face and practicing good hygiene.
Start with the eyes.
Your lips can be bold as well, or you could make them understated with just a dab of gloss.
The rest of your face really just depends on how far you want to go makeup-wise.
When you're finished, you can set it with a powder to make it stay.

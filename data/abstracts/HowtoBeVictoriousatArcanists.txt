Once at the Arcanists site, go to character creation.
In a battle, don't use the same spell over and over.
Don't use arcane attacks when someone has an Arcane Tower on them.
When someone has a Flame Shield, they still can be hit by Fire Attacks etc.
Don't hide all the time.
Don't waste attacks that you have limited use of.
If an attack is rechargeable, make sure you can hit the person with it.
Spray the battlefield with Napalm, or Napalm Bomb.

Draw a circle.
Draw floppy rounded-triangular shapes coming out of the head.
Do two more curves, beneath the curvy lines but farther apart.
Draw a wavy line that looks like a mustache.
Put some large rounded triangles, facing in.
Underneath the mustache shape draw another mustache shape and connect the two at the ends.
Now all you have to do is color your pug in!

Where do they confront each other?,
What weapons or other equipments do they have?

,
Are they both alone or does either (or both) have helpers with them and how many?,
Don't cut the emotional and psychological part out.
Have both sides hit, miss, defend, evade, get hit, fall, stagger and stumble.
Don't be afraid to add a twist if the scene and the story itself call for it.
How dramatic and "epic" the confrontation is depends on where the story is.
If you are constructing the climax it doesn't always have to be a final epic climax in a structurally collapsing building.

Recognize that flushing power steering is not necessarily essential.
Locate the power steering fluid reservoir on your engine.
Mark the current level and condition of the power steering fluid.
Use a turkey baster to suction the old fluid out of the reservoir.
Refill the reservoir to its prior level with fresh fluid.
Repeat the process a few weeks later to fully refresh the fluid.

Don't be straightforward!,
Play truth or dare.
If they say "nobody" there's a 50% chance they might be lying.
If they look down on the floor with sad eyes, they might be shy or they are heartbroken.
If they are startled or froze, their crush might be you!,
If they say out another people's name, then there is a 50% chance that they are making it up.
There is a 1% chance that this would happen unless that person is straightforward.
Start with step 1 or 2 then follow 3 onwards.

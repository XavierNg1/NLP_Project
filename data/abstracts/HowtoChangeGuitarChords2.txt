Start with just two chords, working until you can shift the two perfectly.
Start at a speed where you can sound out each chord perfectly.
Slowly raise your speed as you get more comfortable.
Reverse the order of your chords to cement your knowledge.
Anticipate the chord changes as they come up.
Apply your chord progressions to real music, not just a metronome, to really learn transitions.

Choose a container for your secret belongings.
Purify the container, bless and consecrate.

,
On the bottom of your container, as well as on the inner side of the lid, draw / paint / carve in the pentagram with the symbols of the elements.
Design the seal.
Come up with a protective spell which will maintain and constantly empower the seal.
If your spell includes asking certain spirits / deities for help, that means they'll most likely have to stick around our world in order to maintain the seal; so to prevent them from leaving and thus ruining all of this, make sure you seal the pact with them.
Gather the items you wish to protect and cast a circle.
Put the things you want protected in your container.
Close the container so the drawn pentagrams on the bottom and lid match.
If you wish, you may recite your spell again, channeling more energy to the seal.

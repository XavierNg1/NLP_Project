Get the crisp tees.
Wear the right shirts and jackets.
Wear the right of pants.
Wear the right shoes.
Get the right cut.
Accessorize to look fresh.
Get your tattoos.
Keep it crisp and clean.
Lean like a Cholo.
Don't back down from anyone who disrespects you.
Talk like a cholo.
Holler at hynas.
Get a lowrider.
Be a rebel.
Get the taste of a cholo.
Listen to some cholo music.
Put family first.
Stay safe.

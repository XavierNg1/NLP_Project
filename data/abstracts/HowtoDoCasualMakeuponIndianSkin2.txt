Start with a basic moisturizing cream and some light concealer.
Keep the eyeliner colors close to your eye-lash line, sticking to blacks, greens, and blues.
Apply a firm mascara, starting at the base of the lashes.
Apply a light, semi-matte blush to the cheeks.
Aim for a similar, but brighter shade, of lipstick so that it matches your blush.

Use WD-40.
Test spray a small area in a spot that won't be easily noticed and see if the WD-40 will harm the surface.
Once you have tested the surface and everything seems ok, spray a small area where the adhesive needs to be removed and let it soak a while.
Do small sections at a time.
Remember that WD-40's primary purpose is to be a lubricant.

Wear your boots.
Build up normal polish on the boot by brush polishing the boot for a few days, building up layers.
Once a few layers of polish is applied, buy your self a good quality duster.
Buy a new tin of Black Kiwi boot polish (or use one that you have not used for brush polishing).
Get ready to polish.
Wrap one or two fingers with your cloth.
Apply a layer of black polish to your whole boot.
Remove any excess polish.
Repeat the layering, polishing, and removing process 3 times.
Finish up with a very thin brown layer.
Stop at this point and maybe wear them in again for a day.
Continue the polishing process after a few hours of wear or the next night after work.

Make a boozy eggnog.If you are of legal drinking age, you could give your eggnog a kick.
Thicken your eggnog.If you like a richer, fattier eggnog, you could leave the nut pulp in the eggnog after blending the nuts and water.
Make a thinner eggnog.If the eggnog is too thick for your tastes, add a few extra tablespoons of water before blending it for the final time.
Take the lazy way.
Use different nuts.Instead of almonds or cashews, try raw, unsalted pecans or walnuts.
Add a sweet note to your nog.

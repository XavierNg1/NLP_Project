Before you even go near the phone, take a deep breath, wait between 5-7 seconds and remember what you're calling for.
Call the person.
While the phone is ringing, picture the person in your head.
Let them say hello first, even if you know they've picked up.
Introduce yourself, and tell them your relation to them.
Calmly explain your exact reason for calling.
Give them a minute to consider what you're saying.
Listen carefully to what they're saying and make sure you understand it.
Once you have all the information you need, calmly say "goodbye captain" and get off the phone.
Hang up and breathe.

At the wood supplier's, get the chipboard cut in two square halves: it will make transportation easier, comply with the current project and save you some work.

At the hardware store, get the shelving profiles cut to the measures of the chipboard halves.

Now get stuff and tools to your cabin or shed.Get your permanent marker and mark an "x" over the 4th hole at both ends of the inner vertical side of 1 short profile and 1 long profile.
Now mark a short horizontal line at 200 centimeter (78.7 in).
Get the marked short profile and make the upper rim meet the pencil mark and also make sure the profile is tight into the corner.
Get the wood strip and place it vertically at 200 centimeter (78.7 in) from the corner where you have already fixed a short profile.
Work on a table or a workbench for greater comfort.Mark the middle point of the 2 long profiles with a slash on the inner side.Start placing bolts, etc every 20 centimeter (7.9 in) approx.




The clamp that holds the secondary chain will be located on a beam at approx 120 centimeter (47.2 in) from the middle point of the long profile already fixed on the wall.Take the last double short profile and make it sit on the middle points of the long profiles.Fix it to the frame with 4 bolts, etc.
Insert the boards diagonally, first let them sit on the wall long profile and lower them until they're encased and secured by the half frames.

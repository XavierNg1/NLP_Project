Go to control panel for your computer (located in the start menu).
Go to "View devices and printers" under the "Hardware and Sound" category.
Find your joystick, listed as "AV8R flight stick.",
Right click on the device, and click "Game controller settings.",
A window will come up, select the joystick again on the list and choose "Properties.",
You should now see the control panel for the joystick controls.
If the red bar is off center in any of the axes, then you need to set a deadzone.
Now the joystick will sense that the position is always in the center on that axis when it is within the deadzone you made.
Now you're almost done.

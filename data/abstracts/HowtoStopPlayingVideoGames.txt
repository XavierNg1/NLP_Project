Assess yourself, your history of gaming and why you want to stop.
Make a note of how long you play every day.
The golden step to control yourself is to never start playing early in the day.
Think of all the reasons you want to quit gaming for.
When stopping something you love, it will hurt.
If you feel like you have a severe addiction, and you won't be able to survive without gaming, take a deep breath and think to yourself: "I control this body and nobody can make me do what they want, no matter what".
Tell your parents to remind you to turn it off at a particular time.
If asking your parents doesn't work, download this simple software that will force your computer to shut down at a designated time: http://www.konradp.com/products/auto_shutdown/download/autoshutdown.exe
,
Set the time with the Force shutdown option to 2 hours lesser that what you did on your previous day.
If you are a hardcore gamer who is active on the forums/public chat, then make a thread about you quitting - make it public.
Try asking someone to hide your games from you for a few hours and gradually go up to a few days, weeks, months etc.

,
If there are some games that you don't use any more, give them to some of your younger relatives or donate them.
Try doing other things to get your mind off gaming.
Never try to sneak onto video games, as this will make you want to play more and more and more.
Think of other things.
Don't try to prolong your gaming time.

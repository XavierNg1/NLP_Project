It is sometimes preferable to instead of adapting your computer to be more private, reinstalling the OS, giving you a clean palette, wiping away all the junk that has accumulated.
Add a password to your computer account.
Password protect, and encrypt all your files in a manner similar to the above, and put more sensitive files in places you wouldn't expect.
Know how to delete web history and cookies, and do so often.
Understand that when you delete files, they aren't gone because their data remains, and is allotted to be written over.

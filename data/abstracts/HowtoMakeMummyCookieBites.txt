Allow the cream cheese to soften.
Place the Oreos in the large plastic freezer bag, seal and crush.
Combine the softened cream cheese and Oreos in the mixing bowl to integrate.
Roll the cream cheese and Oreo dough into balls.
Line the cookie sheet with waxed paper and line with dough balls.
Melt the white chocolate using either the double boiler or microwave bowl method.
Remove the frozen balls from the freezer.
Place the chocolate dipped balls back on the waxed paper lined cookie sheet and place sheet(s) into the refrigerator so the chocolate can harden.
Pour the remaining chocolate into the small plastic freezer bag.
Remove chilled bites from the refrigerator and decorate with the chocolate waiting inside the freezer bag.
Finish the bites with two small chocolate chip “eyes” for each mummy.
Finished.

Wash your oysters thoroughly.
Build a fire that's the size of your sheet metal.
Place your oysters on top of the sheet metal in a single layer.
Cover oysters with a wet burlap sack or wet beach towel and wait for oysters to fully cook.
While you wait for the sheet metal to heat up again, enjoy your first batch of oysters with friends.

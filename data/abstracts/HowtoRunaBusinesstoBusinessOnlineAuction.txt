The first step is to pick your category to take to auction.
Once you have chosen a category, the next step is to define it and all the items contained within it.
The third step is to find and engage the bidders to take part in your auction.
At this stage you may wish to obtain qualification prices.
Now that you have defined what it is that you are taking to auction, have established who your bidders are and made sure that they are all motivated and keen to take part, and confirmed that the items you are taking to auction have received competitive quotes, then you are ready for the auction itself.
The final step is to run the auction.

Once you've decided on a text message marketing provider to sign up with, you'll need to decide on a plan or package that best fits your business or organization.
Once you've signed up with your chosen text message marketing provider, you'll need to reserve the keyword that you've decided on.

,
After your keyword has been reserved, you'll need to set up an "auto reply" or "auto responder".
Once your keyword and auto reply are set up, it's now time to start growing your list!,
As your list begins to grow, your text marketing service provider should provide you with some basic statistics on how it's growing and where the subscribers are coming from.

After your list has grown to an effective size, let's say at least 20 subscribers, it will be worth it to send your first text campaign.

,
Start by logging into your text marketing service provider's website and navigate to the page that allows you to send the text messages.

,
Write out your text.
Once your text is complete, you should have the option not only to send it, but schedule it at a particular time and date in the future.
Track the progress of your text campaigns.

Keep it in the freezer until the day you are ready to cook it.
Estimate how long it's going to take.
Preheat the oven to 325 °F (163 °C).

Take the frozen bird, remove the plastic wrapping, and place it breast down on a rack in a roasting pan.

Place the bird into the preheated oven.

After 2 hours, turn the turkey breast up.
Remove the giblets now if they are ready – if not monitor the turkey every 15 minutes and remove the package when you can.
Monitor the temperature of the bird using an instant read thermometer.
Remove the turkey from the oven, loosely cover with aluminum foil, and let the turkey rest for at least 10 minutes while the juices redistribute.

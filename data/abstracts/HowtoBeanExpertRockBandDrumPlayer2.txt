Move onto medium mode, and play one song from each difficulty type (solid songs, skilled songs, blistering songs), starting from the easiest to the blistering ones.
Understand the rhythms you play, and the sound the drumsticks make when they hit the pads should sound logical to you.
Repeat the process on hard mode, but do two songs of each difficulty type until you score 90 percent or more.

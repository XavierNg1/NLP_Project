Realize that just because a band is mostly playing a certain genre of music, doesn't mean they have always played it.
Don't simply listen to what others will say.
Do NOT ever determine a genre by the artist's look, popularity, fan-base, etc.
Don't confuse certain genres as certain things they aren't.

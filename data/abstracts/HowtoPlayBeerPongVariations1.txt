Get in teams of six or more depending on how much you want to drink.
Due to the massive amount of beer that has to go into this beer pong variation make sure to get at least 1 keg.
Put 2 pong tables side by side or play on a ping pong table or table of that size.

Start at the back and put as many cups are you can in a line, than work forward to make the pyramid.
Make sure that every player on the team has a beer pong ball.
Take turns shooting at the other team's cups.
The losing team must drink the winning team's left over beers so good luck and have fun!

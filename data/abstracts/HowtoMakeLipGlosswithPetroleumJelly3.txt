Place 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of petroleum jelly into a small, microwave-safe bowl.This will be enough for one color/flavor.
Put the bowl into the microwave, heat it for 30 seconds, then stir it with a spoon.The petroleum jelly should be clear and smooth, with no lumps or clumps.
Stir in up to 1 packet/envelope of drink mix.The more mix you use, the darker color you will get.
Pour the mixture into a clean, small, empty container.
Let the mixture cool before you use it.

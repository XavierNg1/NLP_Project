Know when to bathe them.
Go to your sink and rinse the inside of it.
Fill the sink with lukewarm water up to the lizard's upper legs.
Get a plastic cup and fill it with lukewarm water.
Take a soft- bristled toothbrush and gently scrub the lizard in the same direction as its scales.
Once you are finished, take the lizard out of the bath and immediately wrap them in aÂ  hand towel.
Gently pat them down with the towel until they are dry.

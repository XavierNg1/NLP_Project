Call the Disney Parks Corporation to find out when the taping of the Christmas Day Parade will be held.Realize that the parade will tend to run down Main Street USA in both parks, so be aware so you don't fight the crowds for a great spot on the benches nearby the parade later.
Be prepared for a long wait as you help create the mood that will reflect the taping.
Realize that there are two parts to both events.
Dress to act the part as if it was taped live on Christmas.
Realize that although the taping is free to additional fees, the only other fee is the park fee which you should have thought about before entering the park that day.

,
Position yourself someplace in the crowds to have your voice "heard" as one of the many people that will act and respond to what the on-stage producers or in the parade would like parade viewers to react to.

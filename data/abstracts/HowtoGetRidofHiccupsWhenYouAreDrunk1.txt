Hold your breath.When you hold your breath, you stop your diaphragm from moving normally.
Change your body position.
Drink a glass of water quickly.When you drink quickly and without stopping, your abdominal muscles are put to work and your hiccups might end in the process.
Try coughing.Coughing forcefully uses a lot of abdominal muscle power, and the action might halt the hiccup reflex.
Put pressure on the bridge of your nose.Place your finger on the bridge of your nose and press as hard as you can.
Make yourself sneeze.Sneezing puts abdominal muscles to work, which can break up the hiccupping action and hopefully end it.
Gargle with water.Gargling requires you to concentrate, and the action can disrupt the way you are breathing and using your abdominal muscles.
Drink a shot of vinegar.Strong substances like vinegar or pickle juice can “shock” your body into a bout of hiccups.
Ice the problem.Take a small bag of ice and place it on the skin of your upper stomach, which is near your diaphragm.
Stimulate the vagus nerve.The vagus nerve is related to a number of bodily functions, and stimulating it can help end your hiccups.
Seek medical treatment if your hiccups last more than 48 hours.

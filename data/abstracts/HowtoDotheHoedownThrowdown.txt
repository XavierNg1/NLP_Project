Clap along.
Pop it, lock it.
Polka dot it.
Countrify it.
Hip-hop it.
Put your hawk in the sky.
Move side to side.
Jump to the left.
Stick it, glide.
Zig-zag.
Across the floor.
Shuffle in diagonal.
Hit the drum.
Hands on your hips.
Do a one-footed 180Â° twist.
Zig-zag, step and slide.
Lean it left.
Clap three times.
Shake it out, head to toe.
Throw it all together, that's how we roll.
Keep repeating the moves.

Complete mortgage quote forms, but know what you are getting into.
When you receive a phone call to discuss your request, be detailed and honest about your credit profile, debts, assets, and condition of your home.
Make sure you compare "apples to apples.",
Ask for a "written detail of all of the fees associated with this transaction, the current interest rate, and a breakdown of the principal and interest payment".
Also ask them to write in the same email, the answers to these questions:



When can I lock my rate in?,
Is this rate good all day today?,
How long is the rate good for if I lock today?,
Is there a lock fee, or a fee that needs to be paid (appraisal) when I lock?,
When you have all of these offers you can compare apples to apples, compare the fees and rates, and choose what you want most.
Consider what kind of institution they are.
Ask them how long the firm has been in business.
Be prepared to make a decision and stick with it.

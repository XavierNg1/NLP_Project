Stop.
Ensure you know your stuff.
Explain why you do not believe in a deity.
Explain how you don't need the "virtue" of faith to justify your position.
Ask yourself what is the meaning of all of this?,
Rise above rhetoric.
Remember the goal.
Accept that you can't win them all.
Reach a happy ending.

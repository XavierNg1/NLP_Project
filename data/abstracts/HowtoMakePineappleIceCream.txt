Freeze the empty ice cream churner-canister (churner blades and the canister with its top), if possible, overnight.
About two (2) hours prior to time you it to finished and/or to serve the ice cream, mix the ingredients in your mixing bowl: sugar, milk, vanilla, half-and-half (or use the richer cream option), and pineapple plus the juice that you saved.
Place your ice cream mix, covered, in your refrigerator.
Get the frozen canister apparatus from the freezer to set up the ice cream churner.
Churn your ice cream for about 20 to 25 minutes.
Serve your (soon to be prized) cold, cooling treat "immediately"!

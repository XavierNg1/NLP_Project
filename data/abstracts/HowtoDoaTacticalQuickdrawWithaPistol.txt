Both hands should perform their maneuvers simultaneously.
Your wrist should be as straight as possible.
Remembering to keep your wrist straight or in line with your forearm, rotate your arm at the shoulder down and forward.
Remembering to keep the gun pointed towards the threat, move your gun toward your support hand at the upper chest and stop the gun underneath your dominant/shooting eye.
Complete the motion, keep your shoulders squared to the threat (face the threat), extend both arm straight out.
Create "isometric pressure" once in the firing position.
Performing a tactical reload before you re-holster (only after the fight seems to be done) is an excellent tactical choice and habit to get into.
Re-holster in the exact opposite order of above.
Practice (perfectly, start slow!),
Try drawing and shooting a target at the range once you have the presentation perfected.

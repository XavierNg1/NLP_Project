Look for a healthy crab.Crabs that do not come out of their shells when misted might be ill, and should not be purchased.
Ensure the crab is housed properly.
Think about alternatives to buying a hermit crab.
Be sure you are ready for the commitment before buying.Hermit crabs are not toys, decorations, or temporary distractions.
Do not buy a hermit crab from a pet store.Pet stores and beach souvenir shops care little about the health and happiness of their crabs, and cram them tightly together for shipment in conditions where the crabs cannot access food or water.
Do not buy a crab with a painted shell.Crabs in painted shells have been forcibly removed from their natural shell and crammed into new shells that might not accommodate them properly.

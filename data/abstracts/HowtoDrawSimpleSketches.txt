To start off, think of your planned sketch.
Look for shapes such as circles, squares, triangles, etc.
Position yourself comfortably.
Good hands: How does that help?,
Position your paper: This goes along with being comfortable, so put your paper at an angle that you feel comfortable with.
If your item is small, place it in front of you where you can effectively sketch it.
Begin Drawing.

,
Start from one side of the object, quickly and lightly take your pencil back and forth on the paper to make soft, light strokes.
Be sure to constantly look up at your subject and compare the two.
Don't be afraid to use the eraser.
Apply Finishing touches: When you're done, take your eraser and remove the sketchy lines if you wish.
Add more interest, add a poorly sketched (but still alright looking) background.

Acquire, find or make a Zen garden.
Choose a rake.
Decide what you want to achieve with your garden.
Consider a pattern you would like to draw with the rake, taking into account all of the other elements, stones, trees or other plants.
While you can design your own raking patterns, there are some time-honored patterns that Zen gardeners use:


The Aranami pattern.
Take deep breaths to calm the body and mind.

,
Use the opposite side of the rake, and with the straight edge smooth your sand or gravel, creating a blank canvas.

,
Rake your garden in your desired design.
It may look easy, but raking a Zen garden requires practice.

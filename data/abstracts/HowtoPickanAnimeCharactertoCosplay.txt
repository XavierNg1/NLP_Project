Think about all the characters you've already watched in an anime or TV show and decide which ones have your favorite costume designs.
If you're going to an event or con, hit the forums and see what groups will be there.
Once you've got some ideas, discuss them with friends or fellow cosplayers--they will always be willing to lend you a hand!,
Assuming you have maybe three ideas left, look at the realistic possibilities of you making the costume.
When budgeting, make sure you take into account all the bits and pieces including fabrics, wastes and mishaps, accessories, hard materials like polymer clay and board for props, makeup, wigs and hair products, and shoes.
Now you're ready to actually make your costume (hopefully a month or two in advance of the event!,
Once you're confident you have the right character choice you can have some fun whilst making the costume!

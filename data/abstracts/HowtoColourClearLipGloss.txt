Decide what colour you want.
Source a tube of coloured lipstick.
Break off as much lipstick as you want (probably somewhere between 1/16 and 1/8 of a teaspoon of it) into a small microwave safe container.
Place into the microwave for 30 seconds to melt.
While the lipstick is melting, open your container of clear fluid lip gloss and remove the applicator so the mouth of the container is open and not blocked by anything.

As soon as the lipstick is done, transfer it all to the tube with the applicator.
Mix it thoroughly with the applicator until the colour is smooth throughout the tube.
Consider whether you need to add more lipstick.
Try it on.

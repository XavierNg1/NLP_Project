Count through the music, by saying the numbers out loud, using the pie game, tapping your foot, or any other method you know.
Look for areas that you can play.
Start slow.
Work on the music one section at a time.
Work from both the beginning and end of the piece.
Don't be afraid to ask for help.
Try to find a recording of the piece you are working on.
When you finally master the music, play it for an audience or a judge and be proud of your accomplishment.

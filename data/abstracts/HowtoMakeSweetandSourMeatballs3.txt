Drain the canned pineapple chunks, save the juice, and set the chunks aside.
Make sure that you have about 1 cup (240 milliliters) of pineapple juice, then pour it into a large skillet.
Stir in the water, vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar, and cornstarch.
Cook the sauce over medium heat until it turns thick.
Add the pineapple chunks, meatballs, and green bell pepper, and simmer for about 20 minutes.
Serve the meatballs over rice.

If you're thinking about getting a tattoo, there is one very important thing you have to keep in mind â€” getting it done safely.
Think of a design you want to get.
Make a rough sketch of your design.
Find the location on your body that you want to put it.
Touch up your design.
Find an artist.
Pick a few and check them out.
If the studio looks unclean, if anything looks out of the ordinary, or if you feel in any way uncomfortable, find a better place to get your tattoo.

,
Have a bit of knowledge of the overview.
Choose the artist whose work you like best and tell him or her you want a tattoo.
Negotiate your price.
Pay attention to the location where you will be tattooed.
When you get there, go over the new and improved picture, and make sure it's OK.
Relax.
Take a final look when it's finished.
Take care of your tattoo as instructed.
Even after it's fully healed, a tattoo is more susceptible to the sun's rays, so it's a good idea to always keep it protected from direct sunlight.

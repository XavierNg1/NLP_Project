Understand what a gold digger is, and is not.
Gold diggers drop hints that they're having trouble paying their bills (sometimes they might even ask you directly for a "loan" to tide them over).
When they discuss their financial woes, suggest ways in which the suspected gold digger can make money fast.
Look for a sense of entitlement.
Ask them meaningful questions.
See what questions they ask you.
Search for signs of generosity and gratitude towards you.
Indulge in a pipe dream.
Watch yourself.
Listen to the types of questions you are asked.

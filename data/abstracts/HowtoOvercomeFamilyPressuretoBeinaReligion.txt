Find others who do believe similarly to yourself.
Often the problem of feeling left out or unaccepted is somewhat of a construct in your own mind.
Know yourself and your own needs.
Do not try to take on a discussion with a whole group of family or friends at once.
Try not to use a holiday get-together as your opportunity to discuss differences with another for the first time.
Avoid situations where the planned activities are going to disrupt you emotionally due to strong conflict with your beliefs.
When you have an opportunity to open up a conversation around dissimilar beliefs you should try initially to discuss your position with as little emotion as possible.
Once you have come to an agreement on a good time to talk with another, you should prepare yourself for the meeting.
Once you meet with another try to let them have equal time to share their feelings and their position.
Remind others of the importance to you of getting their approval.
An important thing to remember is that with any difference, there are almost always, many, many similarities.
Lastly, congratulations!

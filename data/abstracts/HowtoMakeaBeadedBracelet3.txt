Gather your supplies.
Measure your wrist with a measuring tape and add 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.24 centimeters).
Use wire cutters and cut some beading wire according to that length.
Wrap some tape around one of the ends of the wire.
Consider laying out your design on a beading tray.
Put the beads onto the wire.
Finish off by putting on a crimp bead, a lard seed bead, and one part of the clasp.
Thread wire back through seed bead and crimp, making a loop.
Gently slide the crimp and seed bead towards the clasp.
Use a pair of needle nose pliers to pinch the crimp bead.
Turn the bracelet upside down and tuck the tail into the beads.
Repeat the process for the other end of the wire, but don't pinch the crimp yet.
Try the bracelet on and make any adjustments, if necessary.
Pinch the crimp bead with a pair of needle nose pliers and tug gently to test the tension.
Thread the tail through two to three beads and snip off any excess wire.

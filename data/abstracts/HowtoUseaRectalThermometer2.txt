Purchase a digital rectal thermometer.
Be sure that the baby or patient has not had a bath or been swaddled (when babies are wrapped tightly for warmth) in the past 20 minutes.
Clean the tip of the rectal thermometer with soapy water or rubbing alcohol.
Apply petroleum jelly to the tip of the thermometer to make it easier to insert.
Lay your baby on his back and insert the digital thermometer into the rectum.

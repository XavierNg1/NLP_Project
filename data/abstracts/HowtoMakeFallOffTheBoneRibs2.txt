Preheat the oven to 250F/120C.
Cover the ribs in a large piece of aluminum foil, creating a pouch for the ribs.
Pour 3 tablespoons of cider vinegar, or the juice from half a lemon, over the ribs.
Close the foil up, leaving room for steam, and cook for 2 hours on a baking sheet.
Remove from the oven and open foil, pouring the liquid into a heat-proof container.
Turn the oven up to 500F/260C if the ribs are tender enough to push a toothpick through.
Move the oven rack to the top position once you've cranked the heat up.
Mix your BBQ sauce with the juices from the ribs and smother over your meat.
Return ribs the oven for 15-20 minutes, until browned.

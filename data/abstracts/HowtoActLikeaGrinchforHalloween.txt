Stick the decorations where they belong.
If you feel you must make a decorative statement, find the smallest pumpkin the local market has.
Remove the lightbulbs from the front porch.
If, despite all your best efforts, the intrepid little trick and treaters make their way up your path, driveway or whatever excuse for a front yard you have, make merry with them.
If teenagers (each one likely to demand more candy than the entire night's worth of kids) come trick or treating at your door, turn all the lights off, turn the TV down and pretend to snore and grunt loudly, as if asleep.
Begrudgingly get into the spirit of Halloween by giving out treats.
Shut your house up and go out for the evening.

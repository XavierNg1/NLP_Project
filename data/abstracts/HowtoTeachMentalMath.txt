Memorize doubles.
Recognize doubles plus one.
Use skip counting.
Think of plus 9 as plus 10 minus 1.To do this, whenever you add by 9, add by 10 instead, and then subtract 1 from the sum.

Balance numbers before adding.To balance numbers, you can subtract from one number and add the same amount to the other.
Count on from the number you are subtracting (the subtrahend) to the number you are subtracting from (the minuend).
Use the front end strategy for problems that require no borrowing.To do this,  subtract the digits beginning with the largest place value, ending with the lowest place value.
Break up the subtrahend into tens and ones.Then subtract your group of tens, then subtract the group of ones.

Use the shortcut for multiples of ten.
Use the associative property.
Use the factor of 5 as half the factor of 10.
Break up numbers into compatible factors.Compatible numbers are numbers that are easier to multiply.
Double one number and half the other.This is another way of finding compatible numbers that are easier to multiply.
Use the distributive property.
Use the shortcut for multiples of ten.
Use the divisor 5 as half the divisor of 10.

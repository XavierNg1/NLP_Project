Get a 15 by 15-inch (38.1 by 38.1-centimeter) piece of fabric.Ordinary cotton would work for this, but upholstery-weight fabric would be even better.
Turn the fabric so that the wrong side is facing you, then fold both of the side edges over twice to make the hems.
Pin a piece of folded ribbon to the center of one of the hems.
Edge stitch the hems down.
Thread a piece of elastic through the top and bottom hems, and secure the edges with pins.
Fold the fabric in half, lengthwise, with the right sides facing each other.
Sew along the raw edge using a Â¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance.
Turn your bag inside out and use it.

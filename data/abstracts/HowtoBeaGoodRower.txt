The Finish


Extend your legs so that you are pushed as far back on the slide as possible.
The Recovery


Tap the handle straight down with your outside hand (towards your lap) so that the blade of the oar is completely out of the water.
The Catch


Reach as far as you can with your arms without hunching or overextending your back.
The Drive


Push your body back with your legs, with your arms straight and your body still leaning forward.
Repeat.

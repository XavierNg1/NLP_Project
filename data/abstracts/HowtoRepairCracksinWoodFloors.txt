Get some sawdust from the floor you want to repair.
If you can't find any wood to match, you'll have to "cannibalize" a piece of the existing floor.
Using a belt sander, sand off a cup or two of wood from the piece of wood into a container (or however much you think you'll need to fill the cracks).

,
Mix the sawdust with some wood glue to make a fairly thick paste.

,
Using a plastic trowel (or a plastic spatula), lay the sawdust/glue mixture into the cracks.
Let the filler dry for a day or two.

,
Sand lightly.
If there are a large number of patches on your floor, or there's a noticeable difference in level of sheen, you might need to re-varnish the entire floor.

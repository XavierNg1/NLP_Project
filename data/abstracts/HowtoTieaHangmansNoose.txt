Understand basic knot-tying terminology to make learning knots a breeze.
Pull out at least 3-4 feet of rope to work with.
Take the last two feet of rope (from the end) and make a simple S-shape.
Take the standing line of the rope and pass it under all three sections of the S. Simply take the top end of the rope and bring it under everything, so that the S-shape in your rope rests on top of the standing line.
Loop the end of the rope back around the top of the S-shape of rope and then back under.
Continue wrapping the rope around the S-Shape of rope 6 more times.
Pass the end of the rope through the bottom loop of the noose.
Pull on the noose and standing line to tighten.

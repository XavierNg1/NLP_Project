With the two pieces of fabric lined up on top of each other, wrong sides out, start sewing all around, with a sewing machine or by hand.
Turn it right side out and insert the stuffing.
Now cut out an oval shape in the accent colour.
Sew the oval on the place where you want the ninja face to go.
Embroider or sew in the eyes.
Add any details you may like such as embroidering his/her name on the back, adding lashes or a pink (or red or any other coloured) bow to a female ninja, or embroidering a little mouth or sew in a small pink tongue poking out.

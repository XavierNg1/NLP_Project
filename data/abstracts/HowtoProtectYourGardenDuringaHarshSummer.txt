Consider what can be done before the heat comes.
Evaluate your water use scenario.
Work to increase shade.
Work according to the type of plant you grow.
Try to group your plants according to water needs, so plants needing low water are together and plants needing high water sit together.
Increase the amount of wind-breaks.
If the future for your area looks to have increased heat and less rainfall, start replacing many of your plants that just will not survive no matter what protection you can offer them.

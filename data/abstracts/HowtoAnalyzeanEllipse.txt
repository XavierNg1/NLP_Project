  Accept an ellipse in standard formula format, i.e.
  Find the following elements, which you also memorize the formulas for per the following KEY:

  The Center = (h,k){\displaystyle (h,k)}

  The Major Axis = 2a{\displaystyle 2a}

  The Minor Axis = 2b{\displaystyle 2b}

  The Vertices = (h,k+a){\displaystyle (h,k+a)}, (h,k−a){\displaystyle (h,k-a)}

  The Co-Vertices = (h+b,k){\displaystyle (h+b,k)}, (h−b,k){\displaystyle (h-b,k)}

  The Foci = (h,k+c){\displaystyle (h,k+c)}, (h,k−c){\displaystyle (h,k-c)} for c of b2+c2=a2{\displaystyle b^{2}+c^{2}=a^{2}}


,
  Given the equation (x−5)264+(y+2)2100=1{\displaystyle {\frac {(x-5)^{2}}{64}}+{\frac {(y+2)^{2}}{100}}=1}, analyze the ellipse it represents into the above elements:

  Following the standard formula format, (h,k){\displaystyle (h,k)} = (5,−2){\displaystyle (5,{-2})} because both numbers are subtracted in the standard format.

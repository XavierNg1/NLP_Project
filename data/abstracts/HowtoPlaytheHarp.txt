Learn a little about the types of harps.
Determine the type of music you are most interested in playing, as this will influence the type of harp you choose.
Obtain a harp.
Sit at the harp correctly.
Tilt the body of the harp between your legs and lean the harp onto your right shoulder.
Position your hands appropriately.
Tune your harp.
Engage a harp teacher if at all possible.
Take a look at the strings.
Most lever harps and pedal harps are played with the soft part- sides or tips- of your thumb and first three fingers (the little finger is too small and weak to pluck with.),
On pedal harps, all pedals in the middle position is C major.
On a lever harp, raising the sharping lever will raise the note a half-step.
Now, with your right hand hold out your first finger.
Congratulations!,
Keep learning the basics thoroughly, then branch out and develop your skill range.

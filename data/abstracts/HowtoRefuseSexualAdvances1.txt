Directly tell them “no.” It’s normal to want to gently let down a friend, but the only way to make it clear how you feel is to use the word no.Telling them that you don’t think that it would work out, that you aren’t right for each other, or that you aren’t ready for a relationship right now will leave the door open for future possibilities.
Keep your distance.
Avoid explaining your rejection.
Avoid implying that things could be different under other circumstances.
Walk away.
Reconsider the friendship.

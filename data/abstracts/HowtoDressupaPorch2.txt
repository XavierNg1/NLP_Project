Consider balance and scale when you are choosing pieces of furniture to put on your porch.
Try placing a small chair or table on either side of your front door.
Situate two small love seats or two chairs at an angle or across from each other to create a space for casual or intimate conversation.
Add a small table lamp or wall sconce if your porch has an outdoor electrical outlet.
Put a piece of lattice work on any side of your porch that faces the street or a neighbor.

Plan the details of your project.
Produce a scaled down version of your finished mural.
Prepare the wall or other surface to be painted.
Measure the location of specific features for your mural after you have primed the surface to receive your choice of paint.
Paint in the base coat of the background, again, if your subject is a landscape, painting the sky a pale blue (for a daylight sky, of course), the foreground grey, brown, or green, depending on the type of landscape you intend to portray.

,
Allow the background and base coats to dry, then begin marking, using your scaled sketch, the location of key elements of objects located in the foreground.
Work from the back of your picture to the front, covering large areas in single colors as you go, being careful to keep clean transition edges from one color (an element of your subject) to the next, but keeping in mind that mistakes can be touched up later.
Paint in details with brushes of suitable size for the portion of work you are painting.
Cleanup your work with the original paints.
Overcoat your entire project with a clear sealer if it is intended to last a long time on a surface that will require cleaning.

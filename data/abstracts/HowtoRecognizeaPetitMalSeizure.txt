Look for a sudden stop in motion.If someone suddenly stops in their tracks, or seems to “blank out” and become non-responsive, she may be having a petit mal seizure.Most petit mal seizures only last about 15 seconds, so don’t assume that someone didn’t have a petit mal seizure just because she stopped or froze up for a few seconds.
Look for movements of the face and head.
Stay aware of motor symptoms.
Check for a response.
Explore the person’s feelings.
Respond appropriately.
Consult a doctor.If you suspect you or your child may be having petit mal seizures, schedule an appointment with a doctor.
Have questions for your doctor.
Request medication.
Eat a ketogenic diet.A ketogenic diet is low in carbohydrates and burns fat for energy.
Get enough sleep.Many people who have seizures find that a lack of sleep increases the likelihood they will have a seizure.

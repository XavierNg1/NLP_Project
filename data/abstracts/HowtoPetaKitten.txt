Sit down.
Let the kitten smell your hand.
Pet her chin.
Scratch her cheeks.
Rub around her ears.
Rub the base of her tail.
Stroke her back.
Practice being gentle.
Stop if the cat is distressed.
Pet her daily.
Let other people pet her too.
Get her used to you touching her paws.
Work your way to touching the ears.
Brush her weekly.

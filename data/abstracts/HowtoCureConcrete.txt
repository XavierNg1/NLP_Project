Leave the form work used to create the concrete formation.
Use ponding, which as illustrated in the photo above, is done by forming a dam wall of sand around the concrete formation and then flooding with water.
Spray water onto the formation.
Use some sort of cover that holds and retains sprayed on water, like a sand layer or hessian.
Use a plastic shield, which basically is a plastic sheet laid on top of the slab to stop the evaporation process.
Use concrete curing oils or curing compounds.

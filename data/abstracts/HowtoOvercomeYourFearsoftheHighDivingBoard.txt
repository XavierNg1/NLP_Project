Start on the side of the pool, with no diving board.

Practice doing silly dives (cannonballs, can-openers, pencils) from the low diving board.
Attempt to get plenty of height off the low diving board, even for just a pencil dive.
Listen to others who have gone.
Approach the high diving board calmly.Walk to the end of the diving board and relax yourself.Try to look straight ahead.Fold your arms comfortably.Bend your knees slightly.
Take a deep breath.
,

Exhale completely.Put your arms down by your sides for a proper pencil dive.
Stop your descent in the water and surface.Congratulate yourself on taking the leap!,
Try it again immediately, at least twice more.

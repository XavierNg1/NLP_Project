Get at least a 10 gallon (37.9Â L) tank for young ones or 20 for adult ones for it to live in.
Buy crickets; fifty should be good for the first few weeks.
Add a heat lamp on one side of the tank.

,
Put a bowl of water under the heat lamp so it will evaporate and help with the humidity level.
Feed your gecko every other day.

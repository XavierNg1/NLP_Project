To start with your priest, you need to find a common goal.
You need to concentrate on leveling and questing for you first ten to twenty levels as the priest is easily killed at low levels.

,
When you get to level ten, you must now start to work on your weapons and armor.
At 40, you may want to change your talent tree.

,
Once you reach to 60+ join a raiding guild and do some raiding.
Not everyone wants to group for instances with a shadow priest because of their specialization in DPS over healing abilities.

Prepare yourself.
Be confident: If you aren't confident with yourself, you'll be scared of sharing your opinions.
Form a debate: Group discussion is weighing the pros and cons of a debatable topic, e.g. should prostitutes be taxed?,
Conquer misunderstandings: Even though you are mainly talking, and announcing whatever comes to you to debate over; it doesn't stop heated words from spilling.
Find balance: It's important to have those small 'no' or shake of the heads, it's better not to find a topic you all agree on.
Decision: There is always something different for group discussions.

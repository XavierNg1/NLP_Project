Empty and clean a large glass jar, such as a large jam jar or a ketchup bottle.
Wrap the spools of ribbon around wooden clothespins to help them fit into the glass jar better.
Stick the pincushion on top and screw the top on the jar.
Make a label that says something like "Kimberley's Sewing Kit," and glue it to the jar or tie it to the top.

Find the bus line you need.





Locate the bus stop.
When the bus is getting close, raise your hand as if you were calling a taxi.
Always use the front door to enter the bus.
Have your coins ready.
Tell the driver the ticket you need.

Insert your coins on the machine and get your ticket and your change.
The drivers are usually not very friendly people, but any other person will gladly help you.
When you are close (less than two blocks away) from your stop, press the button next to the exit door.
Get off the bus and enjoy Buenos Aires!

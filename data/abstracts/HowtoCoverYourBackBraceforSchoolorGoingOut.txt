What to wear underneath?,
Dresses with an empire hemline or A-line dresses skim over the back brace and are flattering and fashionable.
Skirts with layering or ruffles will hide any strange bumps or lumps caused by the back brace.

Use jewellery, embroidery, frills, embellishments and ribbons to cover up any strange lumps and draw attention to features you want to emphasis.
Jackets, chunky knit cardigans and hoodies will give you the chance to wear form-fitting shirts and tank tops by covering the brace.

Prep your face.
Find a sunless tanning product that dries fast and streaks easily.
Apply a thin layer of sunless tanner all over your face.
Using a small eyeliner brush, take a very small amount of sunless tanner and dab tiny dots onto your nose or cheeks in the natural areas you would get freckles.
Try splattering on the sunless tanner.

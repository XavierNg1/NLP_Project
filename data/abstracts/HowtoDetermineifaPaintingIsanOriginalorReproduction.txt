Do your homework.
Visit museums study the patinas.
Look at the front and back of the piece.
Look at the patina of the wood to determine whether the wood is old.
Look for bristles.
Use your nose.
Decide about how the piece feels to you.
Check for consistency.
Get the work appraised.
Note that some dealers, perhaps including those on cruise ships, may attempt to confuse the buyer with sizes and periods, even mediums to sell a lesser piece at inflated prices.
Research the gallery.
Beware of a scam where the print is not numbered but another document is, which is meaningless, as any signed in stone can be used in place of the real item.

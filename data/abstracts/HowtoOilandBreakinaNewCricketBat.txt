Purchase some bat oil from a sports store or linseed oil from the hardware store.
Coat the face of the bat with the oil.
Lay the bat down, face upwards.
Use a bat mallet (a cricket ball mounted on a handle).
Take it to practice and use it for short fielding practice (use an old ball) a couple of times, then longer fielding practice.
At the end of the season use 220 grit sandpaper, lightly sand the face, edges and heel to remove dirt, marks and most importantly any dried linseed oil off the bat and then re-coat once as previously described.
Lightly sand again to remove any dried linseed oil and re-coat with linseed oil a couple of weeks prior to using the bat next season.

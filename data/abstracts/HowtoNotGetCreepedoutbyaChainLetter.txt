Think: What is the chain mail?,
Usually at the top there is something such as, "Don't read this" or "Stop".
Often the email or comment will be some story, commonly about some monster or fictional dead kid attacking people.
After you read the story, it will say something like, "If you do not send this to ten more people, you will die in two days.",
Don't send it to anyone else.
Even if it is absolutely creepy, keep the mail and smash it.
If you know the person who sent you the email, tell them that it is really bad manners for them to send you nonsensical curse emails and they should stop and think, because they're either panicking over nothing, or else they sent it on as a joke and it just isn't funny, and makes them look like a gullible schmuck for panicking and forwarding something that is 100% rubbish.
If they send you another email, follow steps 1-7 again.

If the person sends you 3 or more emails, tell someone else.
Also, if an email ever says something like, "I will break into your house myself and (enter bad event) you!

Build a small forge.
Get some steel rods or rebar.
Assemble your tools.
Build your fire.
Insert your steel into the heart of your fire and add the air blast.
After you have assembled your tools, and lit a nice hot fire, get hammering!,
Practice definitely makes perfect.
Practice some more, be careful, think safety, and overall have fun!

Before you leave for camp, think about how you are going to store everything when you are there.
Buy some magnetic/adhesive hooks.
Shoe organisers will help save some room.
Get a laundry hamper.
If your bunk is not metal or magnetic, get yourself a cork note-board to pin up pictures, letters and other memorabilia you might want to keep.

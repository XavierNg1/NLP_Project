Choose your bidet sprayer.
Assemble your compression sprayer according to the manufacturer's instructions and find a place for it next to the toilet.
Keep a specific towel in the bathroom to dry off with after using the bidet.
Open the tank and fill it with clean water.
When you are getting ready to use the toilet, pump the handle on top of the tank a few times until you feel some resistance.
When it comes time to use the bidet, rock back on the toilet seat and tilt your hips forward.
Aim the spray between your legs and squeeze the handle.
When you're done, give the sprayer a last squeeze into the toilet bowl and shake it off, to make extra sure that it's clean, then replace it next to the tank.

Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
Clean the fish under cold water.
Tear off a piece of aluminum foil twice as long and twice as wide as each piece of cod.
Lay one piece of cod fish diagonally onto each piece of foil.
Add any spices that you wish to add.
Add thin pats of butter on top of the fish.
Pull the sides of each foil packet up around the cod fish until you have made an envelope that completely encloses the fish.
Put the foil packets containing the cod onto a cookie sheet.
Bake the cookie sheet full of cod for 20 minutes.
Remove the cod packets from the oven and check each foil packet to ensure the fish has been properly cooked.

Make careful preparations for doing the slaughtering process.
Make sure the animal you are going to slaughter is of the right age to butcher.
Make sure you are slaughtering at the right time of year, or even day.
Consider which parts of the animal you want to keep before slaughtering.
Locate the area where you are going to euthanize your beef animal.
Load the gun and make sure the knife you have with you is razor sharp.
Make the shot.
Cut the throat right after the animal goes down.
Remove the head and testes immediately.
Remove the front feet/lower leg.
Get the tractor.
Make slits between the achilles tendon (or gam cord) and the hock bone (equivalent to our ankle/heel) of the hind leg and insert a hook called the gambrel or beef hook into this slit, and repeat for the other hind leg.
Move the carcass to the designated slaughter area.
Remove the hind feet and shanks.
Start skinning the animal.
Remove the offal/viscera of the animal.
Split the carcass in half.
Clean the carcass with cold water to wash any excess blood and dirt off.
Hang the carcass to age it.

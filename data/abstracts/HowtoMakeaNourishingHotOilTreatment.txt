Wash your hair one day before you start the treatment.
Take half a cup of coconut or olive oil.
Pour the oil in a bowl and add honey slowly.
Pour the whole mixture in a microwavable container and give it a final mix.
Microwave the whole mixture for about 2 minutes on HIGH or until the oil has boiled.
When the oil has boiled DO NOT TAKE THE OIL OUT immediately.
Make sure the oil is warm not hot.
Wet you hair and gently massage in the hot oil in your scalp and hair.
Cover your hair with a shower cap or hair wrap and leave it for an hour to soak up the nutrients.
Wash your hair thoroughly using shampoo only and rinse well too.
Style as usual.

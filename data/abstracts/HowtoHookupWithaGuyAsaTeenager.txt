Get him alone.
Touch him.
Pull him toward you.
Kiss him with passion.
French kiss him.
Try a few other kissing styles.
Kiss his neck.
Nibble his ear.
Sit on his lap.
Tease him.
Whisper in his ear.
Play with his hair.
Suck on his finger.
Explore each other's bodies.
Remember that no means no.
Know if you're ready for more.
Be safe at all times.
End on a good note.

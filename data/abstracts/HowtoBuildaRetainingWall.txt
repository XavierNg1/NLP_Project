Plan and layout the site.
Excavate the site.
Tamp the soil level and lay down a paver base.
Begin by laying the foundation.
Start at the most visible edge of the wall, adding gravel or crushed rock to level the stone, if necessary.
If necessary, cut off the top tongue of the base stones.
Use coarse sand and a rubber mallet to level off the first layer of blocks, completing the entire foundation.
If necessary, cut individual blocks to complete the first layer by simply marking them at the appropriate length and cutting with a mason's saw.
Use crushed stone or gravel for backfill on your first layer of blocks.
Place a filter fabric over the backfill.
Sweep the first layer with a broom to free up any dirt or dust.

,
Start your second layer with a staggered pattern, so that the top layer seams are offset with the bottom layer.
Once a layer has been provisionally laid out, apply the recommended adhesive to the bottom blocks and fit the top block overhead.
Add drainage pipes to your retaining wall if the wall is 2 feet (60 cm) or taller.
Add topper stones if you desire them.
Place topsoil in the basin created by the retaining wall.

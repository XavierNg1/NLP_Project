Prepare a blank document file or sheet of paper.
In the document file or paper, place Subject Headings to divide your report.
Note the type of chart it is (bucket, locomotive, etc.),
Note which element and modality are emphasized.
Now look at each placement.
Then see how each factor contributes to the Subject Headings.
Keep doing this for every planet in sign, planet in a house, and planet in aspect to the ASC, MC or another planet.

,
Now, you will notice that the same traits seem to crop up again and again.
Look for which planet, sign and/or house is emphasized the most.
Once you are finished, and you see the "trends" in the chart, you are ready to begin writing your interpretation.
Make the report only about 5-10 pages long.
Print it in large print, stapled, in an envelope.
Afterwards, talk to your subject about it.

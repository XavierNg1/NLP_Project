Notice if your baby is crying.
Smell the baby's bottom.
Try feeling it with two fingers just a little farther down than the top tagline of the diaper in the front of the baby.
Hold your hand over the front section of your babies diaper and slightly jiggle the diaper to see if it moves.
Open it up with the diaper tapes and take a quick peek.

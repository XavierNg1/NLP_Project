Write either the lyrics or the instrumentals first -- there is no "right" way to get started.
Express yourself in simple, message filled lyrics.
Wield satire, sarcasm, and parody like a sharpened sword.
Start singing once you've established the guitar part.
Don't neglect background harmonies, especially in the chorus.
Aim for a catchy, easy to follow chorus that people can join along with.
Break any and all rules, fashioning songs how you want them.

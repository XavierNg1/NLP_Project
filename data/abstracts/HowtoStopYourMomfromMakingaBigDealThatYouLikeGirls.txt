Understand the mentality of a Mom:;
,
Your noticing girls may make her sad: A mother knows that a boy really noticing girls is a sign you are growing up.
Your Mom might be proud, too: Her little boy's growing into a man!,
Mom may also feel uncomfortable: Noticing girls means you aren't a little boy anymore, but may not know how to deal with it.
She may feel one of these feelings, or any combination.

,
If she embarrasses you in public, politely ask her to stop.
If she gets all weepy and/or emotional: Be mature about it as much as you can.
If you have siblings, tell your mother if you're worried they will make a scene.
If your siblings do give you a hard time: Don't act embarrassed about the fact you now like girls--you'll ruin all their fun.
If all else fails, ask your mother if she would prefer it if you liked guys!,
Sit down and spend time with your mom.

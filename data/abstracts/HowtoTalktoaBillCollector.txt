Gather your bills


Gather your most recent bills and statements so you have all the information you'll need organized and within reach when talking with bill collectors.
Know your budget


When you negotiate with bill collectors, it's important to know what you can afford for a monthly payment plan if you reach an agreement and set up a pay schedule.
Stay calm


Bill collectors use all sorts of tactics when they call you, including making you upset or playing on your emotions to pressure you into payment.
Let them talk more than you do


Don't volunteer information or elaborate more than you have to.
Get it in writing


Get the payment schedule and all related details in a written contract before making a payment or giving a bill collector any financial information.
Record the phone call


Use a tape recorder or a phone record feature -- if you have such an equipped phone -- to record any phone calls with the bill collector.

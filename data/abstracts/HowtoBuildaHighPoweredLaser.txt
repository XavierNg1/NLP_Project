Lay the desktop computer on its side and open the cover; this should be relatively easily done by unscrewing the screws running alongside of the cover.
,
After removing the cover, extract two of the main components, the PSU and the DVD burner.
After extracting the first two main components, you need to extract the heat sinks; they will easily pop out with no effort and are usually located on the motherboard.
Open the DVD burner and extract the sled.
Once you remove the sled, unscrew the diode head from the sled and file down the soldered metal to make a smooth shape around the base.
Press the laser diode into an AIXIS module.
After squeezing the diode into the module, make sure that you attach long wires into the diode following this schematic.
In this step, you will need to be very careful as to not reverse the polarity when soldering wires; make sure you clearly marked your (+) and (-) wires on your laser diode.
Drill a Â½ inch hole horizontally into your heat sink.
During this step, you will be working on the PSU.Make sure all of your wire connections are properly insulated and soldered, since we are working with a 110V power supply all naked wires must be covered to make sure no exposed wires are rubbing on each other.
While wearing safety goggles, make sure that the diode is facing a wall of a hard surface, and plug the PSU into a power outlet.

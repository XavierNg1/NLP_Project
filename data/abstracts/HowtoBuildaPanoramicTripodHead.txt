Find the rotation/pivot point by doing the test described in the External Link below.
Cut a piece of wood for the base.
Cut the side.
Line up the two four inch edges so that the side is sitting on top of the base to form an “L” (see the picture above).
Drill a hole near the center of the base.
Make the hole in the side about 4 1/2 to 5 inches above the base – your camera will need room to swing downwards when you’re shooting a picture of the sky.
Cut the arm.
Drill a hole at one end for the arm to attach to the side piece where it will pivot.
Attach the arm to the side by using a flathead machine screw .
(Optional) Cut a piece of wood about the size of the base for the swivel, preferably big enough so it sticks out a bit – that will allow you to put markings on it so you can see how many degrees you’ve swiveled.
Install a socket or insert nut as described in Step 5 for the base section.
Sand all the parts.
Use your new panoramic tripod (and some software) to take gorgeous pictures.

Make your skin blue.
Take a darker blue colour for the almost zebra stripes the Navi's wear and line them along your legs and shorts, arms and all the way up your torso on the tank top.
Buy a pair of tight Lycra blue shorts (cycling shorts are perfect) and a body hugging tank top.
Put lots of natural jewelry like feathers, wooden beads, maybe some brown or tan shells, or other natural things.
Braid your hair into tiny strands, this will take forever but it will look amazing!,
For the ears buy some ready made "Star Trek Spock" pointy ones from a joke shop and paint them blue.
For the tail, take a piece of garden wire about 6 feet (1.8Â m) long.
For your face, use this image as a guide.
For shoes, just attach some beads and feathers onto a regular pair of brown sandals or even cheap flip flops.

,
And there you go, a completely realistic, stunningly gorgeous, definitely eye-catching and individual design!,
However you choose to achieve this look, have fun with it and go as crazy and over the top as you like!

Then click custom install.
If you're not sure whether you computer can handle Windows 7 (If your going from vista it will be able to) click the other option first (again this only applies if you have windows pre-installed).

Follow the instructions that come up.
When it reboots the first time during installation DO NOT boot from the disc.
When it asks you for a license key (it may not depending on whether it is a pre-activated edition you're using or not) enter it.

Figure out your audience.
Brainstorm.
Research.
Warm up.
Once you've warmed up, (you'll need to be in a 'mode' as some call it to write a lot) take those ideas you jotted down during brainstorming and think about them.
Now, the anticipated moment has arrived.
In the middle of writing, if at any point you feel you need to catch yourself up with the characters, re-watch the show, re-read the book (or maybe part of it) or re-watch the movie.
Do a word count.
Write.
Edit your work.
Finally, put it all together in your best form with font and such, and you are D-O-N-E.

,
Publish it...kind of.
If you cannot publish (There is a 90% chance it won't be in stores), you can still print and give to family and friends!

Decide what character you want to cosplay.
Look through your clothes to see if you already have similar items to the character.
Look for a wig.
If you are good at sewing, you can make your own outfit for things like the Prospit and Derse Dreamer outfits and the God Tier outfits.
Decorate your shirt with either fabric paint or iron-ons.
If you are cosplaying a troll, order grey face paint.
Strange colors of makeup like blue and green lipstick can be found for relatively low prices on websites like Amazon and eBay.
Have fun!

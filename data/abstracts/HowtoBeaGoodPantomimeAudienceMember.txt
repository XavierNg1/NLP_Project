Be enthusiastic!,
If an actor tries to start up some audience participation, go with it.
Cheer the good characters and boo the bad characters.
Clap at the end of songs.
Laugh at jokes.
React to whatever happens.
Don't distract fellow audience members.
Keep your mobile phone turned off.
If a sign says "No entry to the public", that means you don't go through it (except in a fire).
Respect the "No food in the auditorium" signs.
Be respectful to the front-of-house staff.
There will usually be a slow song either during or just before the final bows.
Most importantly, have fun!

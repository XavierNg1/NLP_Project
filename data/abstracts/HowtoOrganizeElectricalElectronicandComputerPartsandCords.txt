If you have many parts to organize, label a bin or box for each category.
Label three adjacent sides of each box or bin so they need never be turned, removed or inserted in a consistent manner to see what category of parts it contains.
Put each part or set of identical parts (such as screws or small cables) in a clear closeable plastic bag such as a "zipper" sandwich bag.
Parts with original small containers can stay in them.

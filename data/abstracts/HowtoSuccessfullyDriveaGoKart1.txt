Pick a fast kart (if you can), but be careful because if a kart is going too fast you may drift and lose control.
Enter turns slow, exit turns fast.
Be smooth.
Plan your drive path as "out-in-out", the wide path will help you maintain momentum.
Limit the sliding in your turns.
Time your passes carefully.
Do not crash into people, it may sound obvious know but out on a busy go kart track it is an easy mistake to make.
Learn your way round the track and its history.

Think about what size and shape you would like your bouquet and how you want it to look.
Place floral foam down inside your bouquet holder, if it does not already come in the base of the holder.
Start with the largest, or main flower or flowers, and place in the middle of the bouquet holder.
Trim the stems that you will use around the outside of the bouquet about 1 inch (2.5 cm) before inserting into the foam to create a layered effect.
Start at the bottom of your bouquet holder and hot glue the end of a ribbon about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom of the holder and let dry.
Take another piece of ribbon and wrap around the perimeter of the bouquet holder, leaving several inches of excess ribbon.
Use a hot glue gun to affix embellishments onto the bouquet holder and let dry.
Finished.

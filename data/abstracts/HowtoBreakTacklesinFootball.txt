Know your opponent well enough to anticipate his strength and the tackling technique.
If you are going to get hit in the upper chest, push your opponent off with a stiff arm or simply duck down and get your center of gravity lower.

,
If you are getting hit stomach and waist level, it is best to keep your feet moving.
When trying to just avoid a defender, do not juke around too much!,
If you are breaking down the sideline and you see a defender coming from the side, keep running but be ready to make the first move.
Stay moving.
Keep your hips bent, but not too much.

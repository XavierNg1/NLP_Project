To test the hypothesis that D-T = D/T = R, where D=Distance, T=Time and R=Rate, a chart based on data that includes the hypothesis data of about 60 miles (97Â km) in 60 minutes will be created.
Enter into cell A2 -10 and enter into cell A30 60 and select cell range A2:A30 and Edit Fill Series Columns Linear accept step value of 2.5, OK.
Select cell range B2: B34 and with B2 the active cell, enter w/o quotes the formula "=A2/(1-(1/A2))" and Edit Fill Down.
Create the chart.
With Neutral Operations involving Division and Subtraction, the sub-steps to do are as follows:

D - T = D/T = Rate R where D = Distance and T = Time.
One can argue about negative distance and time.
Select cell B35 and enter -60 into it.
Save the workbook.

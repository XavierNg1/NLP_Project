After boarding, move to a part of the car that is presently less crowded and is less likely to get crowded.
Follow the standard conventions of your mass transit system to minimize the space you take and the extent to which you antagonize fellow passengers.On mass transit systems with moderate levels of crowding but generally good safety records, it is recommended that, if you are carrying backpacks, you place then in front of or between your feet.On mass transit systems that endure very heavy crowding, placing your backpack at your feet risks getting separated from it, due to either pickpockets or the movement of the crowd.

Obtain pickling cucumbers.
Wash the cucumbers thoroughly and slice them thickly, about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick.
Slice the onions.
Prepare brine for the first soak using 1/2 cup of salt for every 4 quarts of water.
Sterilize at least a dozen canning jars by boiling them in water for 10 minutes.
Drain the salt water out of the onion and cucumber mixture and discard it.

,
Prepare the pickling liquid.
Prepare the seals.
Pack the cucumbers and onions into the sterilized jars.
Remove any air bubbles from within the jar using a knife (ideally a long, slender plastic one, to avoid harming the food or the jar).

,
Wipe the jar rim with a damp, clean cloth to remove any residue.
Place the filled jars in a water-bath canner or a large stock pot, using a rack to prevent direct contact between the bottom of the pot and the jars.
Bring the canner full of water and jars to a boil and boil for 15 minutes, adding more time if you are at high altitude.

,
Remove the jars from the boiling water and place them on an old towel in a sheltered area to cool overnight.
Notice that if the jars are sticky, wait until they have cooled completely, at least 24 hours.

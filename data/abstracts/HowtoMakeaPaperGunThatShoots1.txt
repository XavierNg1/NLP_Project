Gather your supplies.
Roll your first piece of paper into a cylinder, starting in the corner and working up.
Roll a second piece of paper around the first.
Adjust and secure the tube with a piece of tape.
Roll up two more identical tubes, then cut them to the following lengths.
Make a handle by hot gluing all of the 5cm tubes together at a slight angle.
Glue the 8cm piece on top of the handle, letting the extra 3cm hang over the right edge.
Glue the two long, 15cm tubes together, then attach them to the top of the gun.
Roll two thinner paper tubes.
Bend a thin tube into a U so that it slides into the trigger tube and the top tube of the handle.
Optional -- make a trigger guard with another thin paper tube.
Flatten a thin paper tube with your fingers, then use it to "close off" the back of the handle.
Take the spring out of an old pen and place it in the top tube of the barrel.
Make the rubber band trigger and firing mechanism.
Slide your rubber-band trigger into the bottom tube of the barrel.
Hook the rubber band up to the front of the barrel, so it is notched between the two tubes.
Load and shoot your paper bullets.

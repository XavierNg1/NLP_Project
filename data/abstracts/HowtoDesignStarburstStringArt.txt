Prepare your base by obtaining a flat wooden board of your choice.
Measure the board sides to determine nail placement.
Add nails to the board.
Tie the string to one corner of the board.
Stretch string to the opposing end of the board and wind around the nail twice.
Move onto the next nail and repeat the process until all nails contain wound string.
Tie off the final piece of string and pull strings into place.
Finished.

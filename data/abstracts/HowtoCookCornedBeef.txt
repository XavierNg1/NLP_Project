A fresh cut of already-corned beef, typically brisket, is most practical if available.
Peruse your local butcher's shop or supermarket for brisket or navel.

,
Choose "navel," if you have access to a good butcher who can prepare it especially for you.
Select a whole brisket, sometimes called a "packer brisket" at the store.
Trim the excess fat from your brisket.
Find a large pot and roasting pan that are non-reactive.
The pot should be able to fit at least 1 gallon (3.7l) of brine.

,
Buy curing salt.
Mix your pickling spices.
Mix your brine ingredients.
Add 3 quarts (2.8l) of cold water once everything is well combined.

,
Place the brisket in the brine.
Cover the top of the pot with the lid or plastic wrap.

,
Allow the corned beef to brine for 1 to 5 days in the refrigerator.
Remove the meat from the brine when you are ready to cook it.

,
Rinse the beef very well.
Wash your large pot very well.
If you bought corned beef, open the package, find the seasoning packet that generally accompanies it, and rinse the meat and its seasoning packet (don't open the packet yet).
Optionally, brown the beef for best flavor.Put it in a skillet or the cooking pot with enough oil for good contact between the meat side and the bottom, and shift it around until the surface turns moderately brown (but not scorched) across large areas.
Place the corned brisket in a pot sufficiently large for it to sit flat.
If you corned your own beef, boil out the excess salt.
Stew the beef.
Add vegetables.
Remove the brisket from the pot.
Rest the meat on a platter.
Carve it against the grain in thin slices.

,
Serve with the boiled vegetables.
Add spices and condiments:


Salt, after tasting, and generally not to the beef itself.
Finished.

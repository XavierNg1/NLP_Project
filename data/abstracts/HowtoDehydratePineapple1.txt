Purchase several pineapples from a supermarket.
Let your pineapple ripen fully.
Remove the top and the bottom from the pineapple.
Slice off the tough skin.
Remove the “eyes.” Notice how the prickly brown dots on the pineapple form at a diagonal line from top to bottom.
Slice your pineapple in rings or chunks.
Preheat your oven to the warming or low setting.
Cover 1 to 2 baking sheets with a layer of parchment paper.
Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven.

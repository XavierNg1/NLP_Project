Find out his/her name.
If you guys go for the same extra curricular activity e.g.
The next step is finding out the background things, such as his/her friends.
You could be close to where he/she is standing and casually talk with your friends while he/she talks to theirs.
If he/she has a social networking site e.g.
Google their full name.
If you know his parent's names, go to WhitePages on the internet and search.
Never pretend you are someone else and start a fake conversation because you can always stuff up.

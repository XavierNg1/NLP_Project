Stay behind and let your teammates get the balls, unless you're really fast.
Once you get a ball, hold on to it until the other team's best players have thrown theirs, then go up and throw it at some of the people who are not as good.
While getting ready to throw, stay crouched low to the ground and start to sort of gallop towards the line that divides the two sides.
When throwing, do not be afraid to turn sideways and almost fall then catch yourself with your hand to help increase power.

,
To catch a ball, let it come to you, don't go to it.
When dodging, always be ready to jump, as they will most likely go for your feet.
Practice jumping, throwing, and running...the essential ingredients to becoming a good dodge ball player.

,
Think of the game as war.
Pay attention to all directions.

,
Don't move if someone throws a ball at you!,
A good strategy is to get some friends, then have them all shoot at one player from different points on the field.
Do not show any mercy whatsoever!,
Be quick on your feet.
Get two balls and throw one at an enemy's foot.
- When you're throwing the ball towards an opponent do not aim for the upper body as it makes it easier for them to dodge it or catch it, aim for the shins as they can't catch it and makes it harder for them to dodge it.

Draw a "radius" on the circle.
Draw a "diameter" across the circle.
Understand π ("pi").
Write down the definition of π as an algebra problem.
Change this problem so you are solving for C, circumference.
Plug in the numbers to solve for C. Now we know that 2πr = C. Look back at the original math problem to see what r (the radius) equals.

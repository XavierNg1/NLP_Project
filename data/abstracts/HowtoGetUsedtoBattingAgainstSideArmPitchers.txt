Long before you get up to bat, you need to study the pitcher when he is warming up, just like any other pitcher.
Find out if the pitcher throws with their right or left hand.
Keep in mind that while side-armers are usually very accurate, they also tend to hit more batters than other pitchers because throwing side arm is almost as tough as hitting against a side arm pitcher!,
When up to bat, always watch the first pitches to see where they will land.
After you face a side armer once, you will realize that they are just like other pitchers and that if you are not fooled by the angle, you will hit the ball.

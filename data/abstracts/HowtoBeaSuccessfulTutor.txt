Introduce yourself to both the parent and student.
Find out what kind of learner the child is (visual, auditory, kinesthetic or a combination of these) and teach according to how they learn (e.g: visual learners like diagrams and charts, auditory learners benefit from discussion and word games, and kinesthetic ones need movement and hands on experiences to remember ideas and concepts).

,
Start by checking what level the child is at with their writing by giving them a few activities (e.g: for English - a description of the last dream they had, a list of pro/cons about having school uniforms, or an essay structure for an analysis of three major themes in a novel).

,
When the child brings you a school assignment, go through the criteria sheet with a highlighter.
Don't do the assignment for them!,
Make sure that the parent and student are both aware that the grades they receive at school might not always indicate how much they have progressed.
You'll often find yourself putting in the extra hours for students.

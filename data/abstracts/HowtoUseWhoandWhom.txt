Understand the difference between who and whom.
Use who when referring to the subject of a sentence or clause.Who brought the paper inside?,
Use whom when referring to the object of a verb or preposition.
Ask yourself if the answer to the question would be he/she or him/her.
When trying to decide whether who or whom is correct, simplify the sentence.
Remember that the distinction between who and whom is less important in informal spoken language than it is in formal written language.

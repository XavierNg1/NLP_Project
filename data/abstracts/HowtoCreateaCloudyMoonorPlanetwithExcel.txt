Open and set Preferences from under the Excel menu.
Warning: Do not access the Chart worksheet as the recalculation time is inordinately high.
Also, only columns E and F of the Data worksheet will be charted, so the other columnar variables and data aren't needed for this article to succeed.
Create Defined Name variables (only the pertinent ones will be discussed; the rest may be safely ignored).
Input variable values in row 4:


MODIFIED: A4: input "=Base*12/(VARIABLE*0.35)*PI()"; Insert New Comment and edit in "Original formula =Base*12/(VARIABLE/1)*PI() but now is =Base*12/(VARIABLE*0.35)*PI()".
MODIFIED: Input the Column Headings across row 5.
Save the workbook.

Enter the columnar formulas:


Cell A6: Input "=IF(ODD(Spheroids)=Spheroids,0,Tip)" and do Insert Comment and edit comment "Original formula =IF(ODD(Spheroids)=Spheroids,0,Tip)".

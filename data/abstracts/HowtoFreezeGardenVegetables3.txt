Boil 1 to 2 inches (2 1/2 to 5 centimeters) of water in a large pot.
Place a single layer of prepared garden vegetables in a steaming basket or cheesecloth bag.
Set the steaming basket on the rack inside the pot.
Once the recommended blanching time has passed, remove the vegetables from the pot.
Drain your vegetables completely.

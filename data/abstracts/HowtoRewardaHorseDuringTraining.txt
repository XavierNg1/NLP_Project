Try out multiple rewards and see which ones make your horse happier or more willing to do what you had asked again.
Give them vocal praise as well as a pat on the neck.
Give them a treat if you have one with you.

,
If you are having them work, such as teaching them voice commands while lunging, allow them to relax.
If you are riding them, always remember this rule- pressure then release.
If it is a hot day, make sure you reward them for their hard work by giving them a drink after a long cool down.

,
After a good day of work done by the horse, let them graze while you walk around with them or tell them they did good and give them a hug before you let them out.

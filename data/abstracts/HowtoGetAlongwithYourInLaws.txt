Listen to your in-laws.
Don’t bicker pointlessly.Families often fight about politics, religion, or the proper course to take in current events.
Treat your father-in-law and mother-in-law as you would your father and mother.Treat your brother-in-law and sister-in-law as you would your own siblings.
Don't share your spousal problems with your in-laws.They will always take their child’s or sibling’s side, and letting them know about problems on the home front will only make them worry.
Remember to set boundaries early on.Many sons and daughters-in-law will be extra accommodating in the beginning in order to win approval and make a good impression.
Adjust your expectations.
Make holidays and events a collaborative effort.When it’s your partner’s birthday, for instance, call your in-laws beforehand and invite them to help you plan meals, games, and hosting.
Recognize parents-in-laws’ fear.As people see their children age, they worry more that they will grow further apart from their children.
Spend time with your in-laws.
Do favors for your in-laws.As people age, they may need more help around the house with maintenance like raking the leaves, mowing the grass, and inserting and removing window air conditioners with the changing seasons.
Offer presents to your in-laws.Don’t limit your gift-giving to Christmas and birthdays.
Find common ground -- hobbies, habits, or interests -- and share it with your in-laws.
Get along with your spouse.Make sure your spouse is happy enough to report good.

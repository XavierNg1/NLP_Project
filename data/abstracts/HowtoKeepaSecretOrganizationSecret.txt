Choose a name.
Have a code of conduct and a list of rules.
An initiation process is a good idea, but do not make it humiliating, painful, or anything of the sort.
Making any and all members swear to keep this a secret.
Do not give someone special treatment just because you like them better than the others.
Follow your own rules.
Do not recruit, or try to recruit, anyone who you know will disrupt the group.
Keep your organization quiet.
Avoid suspicion.
Don't admit anything.
If a member decides to leave your organization, make sure they won't tell anyone about it.
Do not publish anything about your organization on the internet.

Open your desired image in GIMP.
Create a new transparent layer.
Lower the opacity of this layer so that its contents are no longer visible to the naked eye.
Merge both your layers and save this image under a new name.
Ensure that you have incorporated the integrity of ownership or proof of ownership before uploading.
Change the layer-mode of your watermarked image to "Grain extract" and merge both layers.

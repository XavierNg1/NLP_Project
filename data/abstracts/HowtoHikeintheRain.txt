Check weather reports before you travel, and learn to recognize warning signs of a potential downpour, such as thick, dark clouds that obscure the entire sky so completely that you can't see the sun.
Carry the following with you in case of rain:

A waterproof, windproof, breathable jacket.
Wear waterproof shoes or hiking boots.
Purchase or create a rain cover for your hiking pack.

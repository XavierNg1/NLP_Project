Open up your throat.
Engage your core.
Relax your neck and shoulders.
Do a breathing exercise.
Release tension in your jaw.
Hum.
Hum do-re-mi.
Do some lip trills.
Practice the siren song.
Practice tongue twisters in different pitches.
Hold a sustained note.
Work on hitting high notes.
Reach for low notes.

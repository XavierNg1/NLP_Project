Measure out your corn, sugar, and oil ahead of time.
Warm the oil in a tall, lidded saucepan, adding three "test" kernels as it heats.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Add the sugar, salt, and corn once you hear the first test kernel pop.
Stir all of the ingredients to coat and quickly replace the lid.
Shake the pan as the popcorn starts to pop, holding the lid on.
Shake more frequently as the popping increases, resting the pan every 4-5 seconds to gain heat.
Remove from the heat once the popping slows to one "pop" every 1-2 seconds.
Immediately pour the popcorn out on your baking sheet, spreading to cool.

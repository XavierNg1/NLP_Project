Look around the audience and don't focus on only one focal point.
Speak slowly and try to breathe normally.
Laugh at yourself if something goes wrong.
Give your audience a chance to interact with you, (ask them questions, and have them ask you questions so you can touch up on some points that you overlooked and/or left out,)before leaving the podium at the end of your speech.

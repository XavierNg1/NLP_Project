Don't equate sensuality with sexuality.
Take pleasure in your own body.
Slow down.
Look for new ways to indulge your senses.
Be present.
Spend more time doing the things that excite you.
Play with your hair.
Spend more time in the shower.
Use lotion.
Enjoy nice fabrics.
Go to a farmer's market.
Enjoy a delicious home cooked meal.
Go wine tasting.
Listen to your favorite music.
Indulge in nature.
Go to an art museum.
Hold hands more.
Linger when you kiss.
Give each other a sensual massage.
Snuggle and cuddle more.
Write love letters.
Make more eye contact.
Tickle each other.
Spend more time in the bedroom.

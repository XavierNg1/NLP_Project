Kenya is a good place to find traditional musical instruments.

,
Drums are very easy to find.
Drums are most large and round with a taut goat or cowhide skin.
On the coast drums tend to be smaller and are used in traditional Taarab and Swahili music.
The coast is also home to a unique wind instrument called the Siwa which is a large, ornately carved wooden flute capped off with the horn of a cow.
Traditional stringed instruments are found throughout Kenya, mostly originated from the tribes of Western Kenya.

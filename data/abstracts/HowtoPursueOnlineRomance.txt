Look for the internet venue you will use for your romance.
Think about installing an instant messenger service on your computer.
Decide if you want to look locally or globally for the online romantic connection.
Consider the type of person you are looking for, and where you may find them.
Pick an online dating service if you don't have a special someone already in mind to romance online.
Try a free dating site if you are "window shopping" for a potential romantic interest.
Set up a profile.
Be honest!,
Use "Ice breakers" or other services offered by the dating site if you see someone you are interested in, and once you are comfortable communicating with them anonymously at the website, you may want to give them your email and messenger contact details.
Decide what time and for how long you will make yourself available for chatting and romancing online.
Set ground rules for how personal discussions (chats) are going to be, and play it by ear if the content seems to be steaming up.
Buy a webcam if you want to share a visual experience with your romantic partner, but be aware the image you send can be captured and reproduced or broadcast across the internet.
Should an occasion arise where it is appropriate to send your online love interest a gift, there are several options.
Be thoughtful of your romantic interest.
Keep mental tabs about birthdays, children, or other family members they may discuss, so that you are able to recognise important dates and express your thoughts on those days.

Stay faithful, or at least honest with your "friend".

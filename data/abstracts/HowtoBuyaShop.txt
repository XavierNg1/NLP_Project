The first thing that you need to decide is what type of a shop are you opening: grocery, showroom, restaurant, etc.
Now, after deciding your taste of shop you need to find your audience that is what type of customer will drop by your shop to buy stuff.
You will also need to do some serious research on the market.
Now, to buy a shop you need to find a TO-LET.
After finding your To-LET shop, you will need to contact the person who is trying to sell the space and meet him.
Also when talking to seller you also need to gather information whether the premises, furniture and equipment are in good condition or not.
After meeting with the seller and gathering the problems, just strike a deal.
You can also ask the seller to give you a small tour around the shop and tell you how things are supposed to work around.
After everything has been done in the above steps then ask yourself "Am I ready to do this?",
It's a fresh beginning now, start by patrolling the shop and check whether everything is okay.
And last step is to smile at the end of that day and congratulate yourself with a fine glass of red wine.

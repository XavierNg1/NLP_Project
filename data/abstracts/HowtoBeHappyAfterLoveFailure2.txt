Boost your self-esteem.Don’t consider yourself a failure or beat yourself up because this relationship didn’t work out.Just because this love failed, doesn’t mean you are a failure at love.
Use your support system.
Treat yourself well.Not taking care of yourself can make it much harder to be happy after love failure.You may feel cranky due to lack of sleep or feel tired because you aren’t getting enough sleep.
Seek counseling.
Try coping techniques.

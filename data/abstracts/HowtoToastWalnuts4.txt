Inspect the shell for cracks and holes.While it might be tempting to select walnuts with cracks in the shell to make it easier to peel the shell away after cooking, shells with cracks or holes in them do not offer much protection for the kernel inside, and as a result, there is a higher chance that the walnuts will have gone rancid or will have lost some of their original flavor.
Rinse the walnuts.
Cut a small "x" into the shell.

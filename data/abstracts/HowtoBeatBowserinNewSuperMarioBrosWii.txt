After you get through Bowser's castle, go into the room Bowser's in (the door to it is at the end of the castle).
You'll see Bowser standing in a fighter's stance, and Princess Peach in a cage (she'll start shouting "Mario").
Jump on the platforms, until you get off screen.
Jump on the platforms, avoiding Bowser's claws trying to swipe you down.
After the third platform, you will see a gigantic button (with Peach still in a cage right above it).

Lay down newspaper or a garbage bag.
Take the first sheet of craft foam and wrap it around your arm (or area of interest, in this tutorial the focus is on making gauntlets).
Cut out that piece.
Choose one of two approaches to dealing with the base armor:


Take your armor and run your iron over it several times to make it warm and soft.
Cover the armor.
Use another paintbrush (or wash off the one you used for the glue) and paint the base color on the entire piece.
Add finishing touches.
Bam!

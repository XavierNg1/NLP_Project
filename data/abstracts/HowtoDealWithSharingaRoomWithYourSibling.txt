Realize that it's normal to have some resistance.
Try to divide your rooms.
Don't touch each other's stuff.
Respect your sibling.
Talk to them.
Stay supportive.
Keep the room organized.
Befriend each other.
Don't stay up late.
Just do what you usually did, just in a smaller space.
Put a lock on your diary.
If something is missing, ask them.

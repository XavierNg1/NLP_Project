Look up these big selling (and new) consoles: 3ds, PS vita, Wii, (or Wii u) Ps3, Ps4, Xbox 360, or a PC.
Think about your budget.
On The other hand, if you just want a system with lots of family games and is a fan of the famous mario party series or a fan of mario (Because frankly, I'm not a fan of a silent Italian jumping on turtles to save an American princess....can't you just use guns?,
But, if you have a steady budget coming in and have a bit of elbow room and opportunity, than it's best to get the Xbox 360!,
Or if you have to use work instead, get a computer!

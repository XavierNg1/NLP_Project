Gather your supplies.
Cut a piece of fabric large enough to drape over the shoe.
Cut a slit in the fabric so that you can see the shoe opening.
Apply a thick coat of Mod Podge to the toe part of the shoe and smooth the fabric down.
Brush more Mod Podge down the sides of the shoe and press the fabric down.
Stop when you are 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) away from the heel seam.
Trim both sides of the fabric so that they extend past the back seam by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters).
Glue down one of the sides over the back seam with Mod Podge.
Hem the other side of the fabric and Mod Podge it down.
Trim the excess fabric around the opening of the shoe so that you have a ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) hem.
Cut slits into the top hem so that the fabric will curve better when you fold it into the shoe.
Mod Podge the hem to the inside of your shoe.
Trim the excess fabric along the sole of the shoe.
Apply Mod Podge to the underside of the fabric, and press it down onto the shoe.
Gently run your craft knife along the seam of the shoe, where the sole joins the body of the shoe.
Cover the shoe with another layer of Mod Podge and let it dry before sealing it with a clear, acrylic sealer.
Allow your shoes to dry completely before you wear them.

Play.
Watch replays.
You should probably know that by now, but scout, counter, creep, etc...

,
Play with your friends (if any of them play warcraft 3), try to beat them and counter their strategies, if you beat them, they will probably come out with a new strategy, and then you can counter that strategy too, it's a good practice, you can find anything out there (on battlenet =P).

,
You may find the pros rushing or people saying that rushing is good.
Don't get a hero level 2 and think you creeped enough, keep creeping all the time unless you're attacking or defending your base.

,
Play if you want to get better,but it doesn't matter that you saw pros doing something if you didn't play to make sure YOU can do it.

,
Figure out your build order, and strategy against each race, and study the maps to know where to put your buildings accordingly.

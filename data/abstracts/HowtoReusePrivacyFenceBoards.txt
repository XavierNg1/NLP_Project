Find a source for your project lumber.
Check the condition of the wood.
Load the lumber carefully on a truck or trailer to haul it to your work area.

Sort the lumber according to size/type and condition.

Remove any remaining nails or screws as you sort and stack the lumber.

Clean off any fungus growth and mold that can easily be removed.

Sand or scrap other mold or debris off the boards, checking them for hidden damage, large knots, and splits that might preclude reusing them.

Get a general idea of how much you will need to trim your boards to make the most use of them.

Measure each board to cut them if trimming is required.

Mark the angles for dog-earring your boards if this is desired, being careful to make them uniform.

Stack your new used lumber vertically to allow air to circulate around them and to help decrease warping.

Keep your work area clean, picking up scraps of wood with remaining fasteners, or make a scrap pile where there is no danger of anyone stepping on them.

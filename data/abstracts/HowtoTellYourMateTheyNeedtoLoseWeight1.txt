Assess your mateâ€™s readiness for weight loss.If your friend is in denial about his or her weight problems, or if your mate is simply not interested in changing diet or exercise habits, more overt efforts on your part are unlikely to influence him or her to make a commitment to lose weight.
Suggest that your friend try a new diet or exercise program with you.
Ask whether your mate has considered losing weight.

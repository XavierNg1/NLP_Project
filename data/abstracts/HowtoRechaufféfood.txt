Plan ahead.
Start with the basics.
To réchauffé Vegetables - Should you have a range of fresh vegetables for steaming, sometimes it better to steam the whole vegetable (like cauliflower & pumpkin) rather than have raw leftovers that may rot or go stale.
Cooking like this means that you don't have surplus raw ingredients and you can reheat or serve a different way to save time.

,
With surplus boiled eggs, use them in sandwiches, curried eggs, scotch eggs or in salads.

,
With surplus roast, grilled, poached or steamed meat, it can be used in sandwiches, salads, curries, braises, Bolognese sauces, casseroles, soups etc, minced for rissoles, or sliced thinly, marinaded and used as another antipasto snack.

,
Rice can be easily reheated or used in fried rice, pasta can be used hot or cold in salads.

,
Surplus breads can be used for breadcrumbs in a food processor, bread and butter puddings, panades, sliced and baked or fried as croutons or garlic bread.

,
Cakes can be used in trifles, crumbled & mixed into ice-cream (similar to cookie ice-cream), covered with hot stewed fruits or heated with custard etc.

,
Fruits can be cut raw for fruit salads or stewed.
Stocks and sauces can be used as a foundation of other sauces, soups or stews.
Surplus raw cream may be used into butter, sauces, custards, ice-cream, baked desserts such as crème brulee or whipped and used in trifles.

,
Planning in advance on ways to use surplus food and reduce waste is the whole goal.

Be prepared for experiences.
Set aside some time each day for the following exercise: Find a quiet place, at first, where there are no distractions for at least 30 minutes.
What can you feel with your hands?,
At your next meal, savor it as if you were very very hungry, and eating it for the first time in your life.
Go outside and sit down in a safe place.
When you meet a person, put thoughts or judgments about the person's appearance aside for a few minutes.
Experience peacefulness within, as you are able, and send that peace out through your eyes and your smile, gently.
Make eye contact.
Practice mindful eating and mindful contact with people at least once each day.

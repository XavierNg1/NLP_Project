Attitude – Many of us have heard the statement “you can’t sell ice cubes to Eskimos”.
Do not make it an issue until it becomes an issue – I’ve always been amazed when salespeople felt this urge to flood customers with everything under the sun regarding their products.
Ask and shut up!,
Listen, listen, listen – Oh yes, Listen to your customers.

,
Find a need – some customers may know clearly what are their needs, some may require a little help; either group, you must listen and understand what their business goals are and how your product(s) will fit in the scheme of reaching those goals.

OK to say “I don’t have the answer at this time” – We can gain credibility by showing honesty, we need to accept we are not walking encyclopedias.
KISS – Keep It Simple Stupid.
Dress the part – People will judge you before you get a chance to speak, you have to start with a very positive note.

,
Sell yourself – people buy from people they trust/like/believe, use any positive adjective you like.
Never give up – perseverance will win you customers.
Rejection – “Don’t take it personal”, sounds familiar?,
Enthusiasm – This really sells.
It’s not who you know but who knows you – make sure you learn who is the right decision maker and make sure he/she knows who you are.

,
Walk away – If you are in the business of negotiation, sometimes you need to walk away.
Never fall in love with your ideas – Once you mix emotion into the formula you narrow the business choices down to an individual, you.
OK to step out of your comfort zone – A great thing about it is “you can always step back in” and guess what!

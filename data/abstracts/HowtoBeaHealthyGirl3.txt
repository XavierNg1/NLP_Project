Follow the old but famous rule: brush your teeth twice a day.
Take a shower - not a bath - every day.
Refrain from using products that contain chemicals, especially in shampoos and conditioners, as your scalp is the most absorbent part of your body.
Avoid using hair straighteners, curling irons, etc.
To ensure that you smell good, use a deodorant that makes you smell fresh.
Don't forget to care for your face.

Obtain music editing software.
Browse to the song file (.mp3, .wma, or .wav) you wish to edit.
Press the play icon on the toolbar and listen to the song until you reach the part of the song with the vulgar word.
With your cursor, click and drag in the waveform area to select the duration of the inappropriate word.
Press the stop icon (the orange square), click on the Generate menu, and select one of the following options:



Silenceâ€”This selection will eliminate all sound from the selection, creating a traditional "radio edit.",
Tip for the really musically-inclined: Take an instrumental section that matches the key and rhythm of the offending section, and replace the offending section with the instrumental bit.
Note the change of the waveform display.
Test your edit.
Enjoy your music without the profanity.

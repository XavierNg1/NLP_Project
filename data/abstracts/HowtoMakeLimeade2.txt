In a small saucepan, stir together 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water and 1 cup (225 grams) of sugar.
Add 1 tablespoon of grated lime zest, if desired, for extra flavor.
Bring the sugar-water to a boil, then let it simmer for 3 minutes.
Strain the mixture through a fine, mesh sieve into a pitcher and let it cool.If you omitted the lime zest or grated ginger, then you can simply pour the simple syrup into the pitcher.
Juice the limes.
Once the syrup has completely cooled, add the lime juice and water.

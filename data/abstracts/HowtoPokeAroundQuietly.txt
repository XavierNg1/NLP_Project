Pay attention to what you wear on your feet.
If your nose is clear without any excess mucus in it, take small breaths through the nose, only taking in the air you really need.
Wear camouflage for disguise.
When going up the stairs, stay close to the wall to avoid any creaking.
Don't dress in baggy, overlong, stiff clothes (blue jeans should not be worn), they will make noise as you walk that can alert people to your presence.
Don't wear anything that dangles.
To walk quietly, a fluid heel-to-balls-of-feet motion is the best.
If you have to get close to a person, walk on the outside edge of your feet, from your heel to your pinkie toe.
To run quietly with speed, run on the balls of your feet.
If by bad luck someone stirs, looks up/around or looks in your general direction, don't move.

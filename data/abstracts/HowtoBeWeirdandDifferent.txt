Don't be hung up on what other people think about your style.
Be a kind, thoughtful and nice person.
Define your weird.
Decide how you will reflect your weird and unique style.
Be self accepting.
Realize that some people are going to boss you and tell you what you ought to be doing.
Be quirky and use your humor, wit or charm to be supportive.
Go ahead, have some quirk-tastic fun!

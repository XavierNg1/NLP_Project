Create a peaceful atmosphere.
Keep things quiet.
Surround yourself with comfortable textures.
Keep a notepad next to your bed.
Consider how you'll handle the need to stim in bed.
Don't play on a phone or computer while trying to fall asleep.The bluish light from the screen will make you feel less tired, and the distractions of the internet can keep you up later than you intended.

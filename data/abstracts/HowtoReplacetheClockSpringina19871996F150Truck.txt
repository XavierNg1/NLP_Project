Purchase a replacement part.
You will also need:

Phillips-head screwdriver
Torx drivers #15,20,25
5/8 and /or 15mm open/closed end wrench
10mm socket
5/8 and /or 15mm socket
Ratchet and 6" extension to fit your sockets
Torque wrench

,
Once the part arrives, you need to go to your local auto parts store and borrow a steering wheel puller.
Open the hood and remove the terminals from the battery.
This is a view of the steering wheel from below in the drivers side.
Remove the tilt lever by turning it counterclockwise.
Next remove the bottom cover which is held by 3 Phillips-head screws in the bottom and maybe a 4th screw in the right lower corner (as seen from the driver's seat).Using a 10 mm socket and ratchet, remove the 4 nuts that hold the airbag in place

,
Pull the airbag gently and lay it down to expose the wires you need to disconnect.
After disconnecting the wires, loosen the center bolt which holds the steering wheel and back it out until there are only 2 or 3 threads engaged.
Remove the steering wheel and remember how the wires were routed through the steering wheel.
Take the new clock spring and locate it on the steering wheel column and attach it loosely with the torx head screws.
Re connect the battery terminals under the hood and test the horn button and see that the airbag light is no longer blinking.

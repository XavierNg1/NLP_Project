Consider keeping a hiccup trigger log.
Feed your baby twice as often, but half as much at each feeding.
Burp your baby.
Review your latching technique.
Feed your baby before she gets too hungry.
Sit your baby upright in your lap while feeding.
Keep your baby sitting up for at least twenty minutes after a feeding so that any trapped air rises to the top of her stomach.
Be patient.

Save up wine corks over a period of weeks and months.
Find an old picture frame, a strong piece of cardboard, MDF or a piece of plastic.
Glue the outside frame to your cardboard or MDF with very strong craft glue.
Cut your corks in half lengthwise with an X-acto knife.
Place the frame on a flat work surface.
Place a medium-sized line of glue down the length of your cork.
Glue 2 corks horizontally right next to the 2 vertical corks.
Attach a hanger to the back of the cork board.

Cut two large rectangles out of your choice of fabric.
Pin the two fabric pieces together with the right sides facing in.
Sew around the edges using a Â½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.
Clip the corners, then turn the fabric inside out.
Fold the bottom edge up by 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) and press the entire piece flat with an iron.
Cut a 27-inch (68.58-centimeter) long piece of ribbon, fold it in half, and insert it by 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) into the gap.
Topstitch all the way around the roll up.
Draw vertical lines 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) apart on the pocket to make the slots for your knitting needles.
Topstitch on top of the lines.
Use your roll up.

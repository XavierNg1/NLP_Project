Get some ring-sized memory wire.
Measure out 1¼ to 1½ loops, then cut them with a pair of heavy-duty wire cutters.Memory wire is very difficult to cut, so you want to use a pair of heavy-duty wire cutters for this.
Twist one of the ends of your memory wire into a small loop.
Add your bead(s), if desired.
Consider adding a charm instead of beads.
Make another loop at the end of the memory wire to secure the beads.
Use the wine glass charm.

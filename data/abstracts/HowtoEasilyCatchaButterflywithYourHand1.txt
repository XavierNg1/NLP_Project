Wait for the butterfly to land on a flower.
Still keeping your fingers in the same position, catch the butterfly's wings with your thumb and pointer fingers.
If you want to take it for a journey, get a partner and have the partner put his/ her hands together with the four fingers of the right hand in between the thumb and pointer finger of the left hand.
Put the butterfly in through the small hole at the top.

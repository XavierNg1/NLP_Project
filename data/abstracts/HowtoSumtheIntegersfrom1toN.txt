Define the largest integer to be summed as N. Summing integers from 1 to any given number N requires you to define N as a positive integer itself.
Multiply N by (N+1) and divide by 2.
Solve for your answer.
Understand how the equation (N(N + 1))/2 is derived.
Decide whether you're summing inclusively or exclusively.
To find the sum of the integers between two numbers N1 and N2, find the sum for each value of N separately and subtract.
Understand why this process works.

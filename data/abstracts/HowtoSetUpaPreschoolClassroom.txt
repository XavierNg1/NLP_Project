Start out with a simple task.
Circle Time: This is the central component of any preschool classroom, and as such, you should take a lot of time and effort into making it engaging not only for the students, but for the parents as well.
Cubbies: Coat hooks, milk crates, or box shelves can all serve as cubby areas for children.
Teacher supplies: In addition to basic supplies that should be offered by your center, there are several items you may need to request or buy yourself.
Understand that creating centers can be a bit of a challenge.
Math & Science: These toys and activities can take many forms, but many are fine motor toys.
For general centers, there needs to be plenty of manipulatives.
Reading center: This is usually treated as a quiet area.
Blocks: Blocks are not only great for fine motors, but are easily one of the most popular centers in any preschool classroom.
Ideally, you can go outside every day.
Gross motor examples include:


Bowling with paper towel rolls and a large ball
CDs with dance music
Obstacle courses.
Dramatic Play: This is a center that should change at least monthly and should be based on the monthly or weekly theme.
Free art: Some teachers overlook this area because most classes have a daily art project.
Art displays: Children are, and should be, proud of their work.
Sensory: This can seem like an easy center to work on, but many teachers aren't creative enough.
a "garden" with dirt, shovels, watering buckets, and beads for seeds


sand with dinosaurs, brushes, and magnifying glasses
an aquarium with rocks, toy houses, toy fish, and plants
finger painting with paint and shaving cream.

Puzzles and Games: Educational games and puzzles are crucial for not only fine motor skills, but also the specific skill each puzzle focuses on.

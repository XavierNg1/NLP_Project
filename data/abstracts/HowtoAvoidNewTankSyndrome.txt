Give your tank a good wash, without soap or other harmful chemicals, before filling it with water.
Set up your new tank with gravel/sand, ornaments, lights, (heater for tropical) and a filter.

,
Add water and dechlorinator.
Switch on the heater and filter and leave to run.

,
Find a fish-keeping buddy with a mature tank (over 6 months without problems) or a trusted local fish shop.

,
Get some of their filter media.
Add the media to your filter.
Test the water before you get fish.
Feed the fish sparingly twice a day.
Test regularly and monitor nitrate levels.
Don't leave the hood lights for more than 8 to 12 hours, or algae will be encouraged to grow (and might take over your tank).
Get rid of algae that is growing on your fake plants and ornaments.

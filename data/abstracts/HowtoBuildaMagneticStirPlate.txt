Mount the fan to the enclosure.
Mount the remaining components (DC power jack, potentiometer, on/off switch) to the enclosure.


,

 Voltage Regulator Pin Diagram

Wire the Potentiometer, LM317T Voltage Regulator, Resistor, and Fan together.
Wire the Capacitors if necessary.
Double Check & Turn it on.
Add electrical tape to exposed wires.

FINAL THOUGHTS.The Images do not use the 1.0 ÂµF Capacitor because of the added build cost.

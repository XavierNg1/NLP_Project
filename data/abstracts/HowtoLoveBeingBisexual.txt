Come out when you feel ready.
If you're getting teased about it, each and every time say: "You can't judge me for it since it is just part of what makes me who I am.
Make sure you have confidence and do not care what people say about you.
Work on your true image, and be true to it.
If you want to "experiment" but are in a relationship, be honest with yourself and your partner.
Know that your sexuality or gender preference may change over time.

The third stage is to add the riser to the top opening of the santee.When installing the hose, use no smaller than a 1-1/4" hose at the top of the riser or better is a 2" hose for the best steam flow to the steam box.
The Clear PVC braided hose attaches to this hose barb and will go up and into the bottom of the steam box, don't cut this hose to length until the steam box has been finished and installed on the platform.Hold the finished PVC boiler in place ( on the 2'x4' plywood platform) with the use of an upright 2x4 with steel pipe clamps attaching the boiler to the 2x4 upright and attaching the 2x4 upright to the platform with 2x4 bracing.
This PVC boiler works very well, but before using this system, ensure that there will be no pressure build up, no water leaks and the electrical connections are correct and the ground wire connected.

Argue with yourself.
Buy two notebooks, a boring, school-type notebook, and a really fancy frilly one with the word "Diary" written on at the front.
Swap round the two notebooks!,
In your actual diary, stick a printed piece of paper inside saying your name, email and telephone number inside so people know where to give it back if it gets lost.
Write some really stupid, boring entries in your decoy.
Get a lock and key for your real diary, this stops other people reading it, even though it blends in.
Don't forget to write daily.
Don't worry if you have missed out a day, week, or even a month!,
Frequently make comments like: ' Diaries are boring'.
Have fun!

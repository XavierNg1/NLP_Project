Cut a 2.5ft piece of wire, rope, or cord.
Create a small loop at the end of the wire.
Twist the end of the wire at the bottom of the loop to hold it in place.
Take the opposite end of the wire and push it through your slip-knot loop.
Keep pulling the end through your slip-knot loop to make a noose.
Place a branch, felled tree, or bar horizontally over the ground.
Tie your snare to the bar.
Create barriers to force rabbits towards your trap.

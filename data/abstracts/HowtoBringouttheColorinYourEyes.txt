Rock the colors that work with your skin tone.
Try not to use colors that are the same as your eye color.
If you have brown eyes, deep, earthy colors are great.
If you have green eyes, pretty much the same as brown eyes.
If you have blue eyes, rich brown shades always work with a beautiful blue eye.
If you have hazel eyes, feminine, girly pink pale purple, and sheer blush shades are great with hazel, along with black.

If you want to figure out the perfect eyeliner for you, just use a flashlight and shine it at your eye.

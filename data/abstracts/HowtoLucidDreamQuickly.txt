To start, you should be laying down in the dark, when you are exceptionally tired.
Have you ever felt the feeling of slipping into sleep, or everything being so peaceful all you see is black while you know that you still are awake?,
Once you have the feeling that we mentioned in the last step, try to imagine you jumping on a trampoline.
Keep doing one of those two methods, and whatever I said you may feel, the feeling will get stronger.
After you have been doing this for 10-30 minutes, it will feel like you were thrown into the whole scenario of what you where imagining.
It may be a little hard to move at first, because you are not used to being able to move yourself in your dreams.
It may take a little practice, but it is very true to happen.

Purchase a headphone jack at Radio Shack, about $4.
Cut two lengths of speaker wire, long enough to reach from the internal speaker contacts to the contacts on the headphone jack.
Purchase an FM transmitter from WalMart, in the automotive section, around $12.
The headphone jack will accept an external speaker providing it has a stereo mini plug at the end.
If you use an external speaker with your new set up, use one that has a volume control on it.
When I first thought of doing this I thought it was beyond my pay grade, but as I thought more about it I decided to give it a shot.
With the transmitter plugged in I can now receive the music on a boom box in the house, or any radio within range, and I have that boom box hooked up to two outside speakers under the eaves on the front of my house, and broadcast the music on those at the same time as through the transmitter.
For those who have a similar unit but have trouble with it working properly on a timer, I have this tip.
This was an easy project and I'm glad I didn't give up on it.

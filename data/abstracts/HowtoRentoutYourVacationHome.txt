Check your homeowner's insurance policy.
Make sure your local zoning regulations and homeowners association permit residential property rental.
Decide what furniture you'll leave and what will go into storage.
Remove valuables from your home.
Make sure appliances and mechanicals are in good working order.
Hire a local property manager to handle all repairs and emergencies, or create a list of trusted service people to leave with the tenant.
Have a cleaning service come in to thoroughly clean the house before the rental starts, then make it a contingency in the rental agreement that the tenants hire the same service to clean before they leave.
Get a security deposit.
Run a background check on your renters and meet them in person, if possible, before the lease is signed.
Arrange to pay all your basic bills in advance or online.
Make sure your pets have a place to go.
If you'll be renting to people from another city or region, leave a local reference packet with names of area businesses, a map, local emergency information, and names of neighbors.
Keep all expense and income records for your Federal income taxes...the revenue you receive is taxable, but you can deduct the mortgage, property taxes and relevant expenses if you keep good records.

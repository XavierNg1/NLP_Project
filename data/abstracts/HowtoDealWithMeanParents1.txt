Take a moment to calm down before talking to your parents.
Recognize and admit any wrongdoing to turn the conversation off of you.
Listen to them without interruption.
Repeat back to them the main ideas of their argument.
Walk them through your point of view.
Come up with solutions together to ensure this fight doesn't happen again.
Recognize that your parent's "meanness" is just a way to show they care.

Purchase or salvage a 10 foot (3.0Â m) PVC plastic pipe, of about a 4-inch diameter.
Measure the pipe into three even divisions.
Measure in from the ends to account for the end caps for the pipes.
Draw guidance lines down the side of each pipe indicating the trough area to be cut away.
Cut the top quarter of the pipe off.
Drill holes for the screw hanger attachments to each end of the pipe, with the end cap intact.
Remove the end caps.
Attach the screw hangers to the end caps.
Repeat for each length of pipe you're turning into a chicken trough feeder.

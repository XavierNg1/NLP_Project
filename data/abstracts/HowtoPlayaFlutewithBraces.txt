Start by practicing with a straw.
Practice next with a head joint.
Put masking tape over the lip plate.
Start playing the flute again.
Work through all of your scales, and if you are able, take them up an extra octave.
You may have to adjust your embouchure (the hole between your lips when playing) as well as tuning beforehand.
Practice.

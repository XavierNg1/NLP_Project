Stretch the opening of the balloon's lip around the faucet.
Fill the balloon with water.
Remove the water balloon from the faucet, with its neck between the index and middle fingers of one hand.
Grab the lip with your free hand and loop the balloonâ€™s neck over the top of your pinching hand's thumb and index finger.
Pass the lip from your looping hand to your wrapped-up finger and thumb.
Retract the lip, along with your finger and thumb, backward through the loop that's wrapped up around them.
Allow the loop to slide forward, off your fingers, and the water's weight should tighten the knot for you.

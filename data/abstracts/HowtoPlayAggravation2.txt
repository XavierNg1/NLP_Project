Have each player choose four marbles of the same color.
Put all of your marbles on the corresponding "base.",
Roll the die.If you roll a 1 or a 6, you may move your first marble out onto your color "start" space.
From now on, you may take turns by moving any one marble of your choice in the direction of the arrows on the board, or move one of your marbles from base to start, only if you rolled a 1 or 6.
If an opponent lands on one of your marbles by exact count, your marble is aggravated and is immediately sent back to its base.
Star spaces:

If your marble lands on one of the center star spaces by exact count, you may enter the "Star space shortcut" system.
Super shortcut:

If you are outside the star spaces and happen to be able to land on the center "Super shortcut" space by exact count, you may do so.
Once a marble has made it all the way around the board, you may retire that marble into your "home" area.

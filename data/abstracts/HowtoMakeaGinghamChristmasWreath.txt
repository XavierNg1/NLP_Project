Buy a medium-sized wreath form from the craft store.
Buy or find scraps of gingham fabric.
Cut approximately 100 strips of gingham and other fabric.
Take a strip of fabric and wrap it around the wreath form, so that the ends are in front.
Grab another strip of fabric, in another color, and knot it above the last piece.
Stop knotting when your wreath is completely covered in a thick layer of fluffy fabric ties.
Trim the fabric carefully with fabric scissors if the strips are too long.

,
Take another piece of fabric and knot it around the top of the wreath.
Embellish the wreath with Christmas d√©cor, if you desire.
Try to affix the decoration to the knot of a fabric scrap, rather than the ends.

Select the size.
Place the middle of the "X" a little higher for use with a chainsaw; rather than lower for a bow saw(if you prefer).








,
Design your sawbuck/sawhorse by considering various methods shown in the illustrations.
Use suitable boards for your project.
Consider starting with one (the first) "X" temporarily attached together with two nails/screws to see how tall and wide that you want to make it.
Use this as your pattern for the rest.
Design a lower sawbuck if you would like to use the "X" sawbuck with a hand "bow-saw".
Design a wide, heavily braced base to give you more stability while handling a chainsaw.
To build a non-folding sawbuck, simply connect the "X" forms together, using 4 to 6 nails/screws driven permanently into the near-center of each "X".

Study your religion.
Be honest with yourself.
Be honest with your parents and leaders: If you discover that there’s something about the church that you don’t believe or that really bothers you, let your parents and bishop/branch president know.
Be honest with friends: If you’ve been honest with yourself, then you should know what you really do believe, and a good friend will respect your beliefs.
Realize that everyone has beliefs.
Girls and Modesty: this is hard.
Be patient with your leaders.
Be positive.

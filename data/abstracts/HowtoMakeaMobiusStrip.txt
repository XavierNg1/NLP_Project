Cut a strip of paper about 6 inches (15Â cm) long and 1.5 inches in width.
Label the corners of the strip A, B, C, and D. In the top left corner of the strip, write a small letter A; in the top right corner, write a small B; the bottom left, the letter C; and the bottom right, the letter D. You will use these letters to align the strip after the twist.
Twist the A-C side a half turn and bring it to the B-D side.
Draw a line along the middle of the strip.
Color the edge of the strip with a highlighter.
Cut the Mobius strip along the central line you drew earlier.
Cut the Mobius strip 1/3 of the way away from the edge.

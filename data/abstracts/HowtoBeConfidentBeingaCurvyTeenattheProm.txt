Take time looking for your perfect dress (in advance).
Don't try to squeeze into a dress that is too small for you just because you think that it is the size that you "should" be wearing.
Eat a well-balanced breakfast to prepare you for your very long day.
Go get your hair and nails done as well.

,
Tell yourself that you are "special" and that you are going to be "gorgeous".
Make sure your family knows how important this day is to you.
Stand up straight.
If you're having trouble finding a date, don't immediately jump to 'oh, it's because I'm curvy' and get disheartened.
If you can't find anyone you really like to go with, don't be ashamed to go with a few friends!

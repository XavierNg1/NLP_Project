Head shots are key.
Use walls!!!,
Find someone to play with.
Don't get mad at yourself.
Crouch.
If you are behind a rock and you see that someone is waiting for you to come out, you have two options: 1) Run like mad in the direction that is farthest away from the center of the enemy's scope.
Never run straight at the sniper as it will be easier for them to shoot you.
If someone is near a ledge and too busy to notice anyone around them then you don't have to waste any bullets on them.
Run straight at them.
Be sure to throw grenades in the air and be shooting at your opponent (rather than the vehicle itself) when you aren't throwing the grenade.
If you kill your opponent, stop shooting immediately if you don't want to destroy the vehicle.If you are out of ammunition or just don't want to waste it, try stealing a vehicle while the person is shooting someone else.It often helps to hold RB (use) while fighting a vehicle since this will trigger your character to automatically hijack it.
If you are facing a Ghost (the purple one), don't engage until they stop firing and begin to use their turbo toward you.
Use the missile launcher if possible.
Fight fire with fire.
If you're playing Infection and have decreased gravity and/or increased speed for zombies on, simply get a running start.
Experiment with the weapons and vehicles in the game to see which ones you are better at using.
Once you have found a weapon you like, think of how it would perform in situations where there are many enemies, or possibly only one enemy.
Use cover and items to your advantage.
Know how to counter vehicle attacks.
Be sure you have ammunition.Always be aware of your surroundings; keep track of your motion tracker in case any enemies are near.Keep a close range, and a medium range weapon at hand at all times.

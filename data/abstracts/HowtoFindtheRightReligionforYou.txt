Keep an open mind.
Meet the religious leaders, preachers and teachers in your neighborhood.
Ask yourself, "Why do I need or want to follow a religion?",
Beware of cults.
Don't make a quick decision especially as a young person.
Find a particular religion to follow if you can.
Avoid assuming that "one religion is just as good as the other" for yourself.
Learn about the good and the bad aspects of certain religions.
Think about what you believe about God or gods: If you believe there is only one God, then your choice of religions is narrowed down to monotheistic religions.
Check to see which religions fit your beliefs when discussing the physical presence of God(s).

Stand the trellis frame over your cucumber plot.
Firmly press the legs of the trellis into the soil.
Drive a 2-foot (61-centimeter) stake into the ground next to one of the legs.
Repeat the staking and tying procedure with the other three legs.
Hammer 1-inch (2 1/5-centimeter) nails halfway into all four netting bars.
Tie clotheslines to each nail to form a net for your cucumbers to climb up.

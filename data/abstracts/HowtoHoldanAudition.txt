Find a place large enough to hold the audition.
Get the equipment you require.
Decide whether you are going to hold 'open' or 'set' auditions.
Make your advertisements.
Set an exact time limit on a person's performance and make sure they know this before they come.

,
If they are auditioning for a part in a film or play, provide them with a script as soon as they decide that they would like to audition.

,
Create forms for when people arrive.
Try to accept every person that rings for an audition, even if they can't make in on your assigned day.
Get together a panel of interviewers, and a few people to organise queues etc, if holding a large audition.
Get the organisers to make a few refreshments for the people auditioning, this shows you care!

,Make sure the place where the people are auditioning is separate from the people waiting to interview, this helps calm nerves and will make it more fair

,
Always give constructive criticism if you have any but don't be mean.
Once the auditions are over, make your decisions and inform the person you've accepted first, then ring/email each person saying that you're sorry but that you'll keep their form in case another opening becomes available.

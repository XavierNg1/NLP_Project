Use this method unless you know the place you got it from uses best practices, especially if you have a saltwater tank.
Always keep a small 10-20 gallon, low or no light tank, treated with copper or other typical treatments.
Put all new fish into this tank.
Take the bucket and add 2 cups of water from the main take to the bucket about every 5 minutes.

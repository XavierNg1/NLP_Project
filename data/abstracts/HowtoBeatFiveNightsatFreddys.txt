Know there are four animatronics.
Check the door lights and cameras only sparingly on Night 1.
Check the doors rapidly on Night 2.
Check the door lights more often than on the previous two nights on Night 3.
Use the method of checking door lights more, but be more aware of Freddy's laugh on Night 4.
Check Foxy and Freddy and check the doors while keeping the right door shut when viewing the monitor on Night 5.
Use the same method for Nights 3 to 5 on Night 6, but be much quicker and more efficient.

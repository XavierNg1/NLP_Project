Get a spiral notebook, a roll of masking tape, a pen, a Sharpie, and some sheets of labels.
Make a list of all the rooms in your new home: dining room, kitchen, master bedroom, etc.
Using masking tape, make tabs for your spiral notebook that match the categories you just created.
Take a sheet of labels for each of your rooms, and write on the labels K-1, K-2, K-3, etc.
Pack your first box.
Now, on the page of your notebook for that room (for example, your K section for kitchen), write the box number and detailed information about the contents.
Seal the box and slap a pre-made label or two on it.
When you get to your new home, make signs to put on every door so the people unloading know where everything goes without you telling them.

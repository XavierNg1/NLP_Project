Make sure that you're holding the needles in the most comfortable way for you.

Don't pull too hard on your supply of yarn.

Use knitting needles of an appropriate size for the yarn.

Use a knitting needle material that is suited to the yarn you are using.

Use yarns that are slippery and at least a little stretchy.

Try circular needles.

Introduce a bit of something to help the yarn slide on the needles.

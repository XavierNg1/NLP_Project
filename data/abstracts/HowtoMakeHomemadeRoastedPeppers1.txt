Set the oven to 500 degrees, or use the broiler if you're in a hurry.
Line the cookie sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper and spray lightly with nonstick cooking spray.
Set the peppers on the sheet and put in the oven.
Turn the peppers a quarter turn every 8-10 minutes, or as the skin becomes noticeably brown.
Remove the peppers after 25-40 minutes, or when the skin is blistered and black.
Heat your grill or gas-range stove to high heat.
Place the uncut peppers directly over the heat source.
Use tongs to turn the peppers every 3-4 minutes.
Remove the peppers once they are evenly blackened and soft.

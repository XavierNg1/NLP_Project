General - South Jersey Accent


There is a slight Southern "twang" to the accent in most of southern NJ, which is probably difficult to mimic well without overdoing it.
Consonants


'D' at the end of the word stops when the tongue hits the palate, although it has become fashionable among some younger people (<30) to emphasize the final 'D' and append a quiet "uh" for emphasis, so that, for example, "I did!",
Vowels


Long vowels tend to be elongated a bit, similar to a Southern accent, or what most Americans would think a stereotypical English accent sounds like.
Specific Words


'Water' is usually pronounced something like "wooder" (wood'-er) or "wudder".
Expressions


"Pert'near" has almost disappeared, but it's still heard from time to time and means "pretty near," i.e. nearly or almost.

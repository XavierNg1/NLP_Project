Gather your materials.
Roll a small piece of the mold-and-bake clay to a thickness of about 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm), using a rolling pin or other rolling tool (you may even be able to use a pen or pencil).
Use a cookie cutter to cut the clay into the desired shape.
Create a hole approximately 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the top of the shape, using a sharp object such as a needle or toothpick.
Place the clay shape on a baking sheet and bake according to the directions on the package.
Attach your slip ring or keychain assembly to the cooled shape.

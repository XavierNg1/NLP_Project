Take the time you need: at first, you may feel like you are numb, or in shock.
Read or listen to the stories of others: In her memoir North of Hope, Shannon Polson writes about her parents being killed by a grizzly bear while they were on a river trip in the Arctic.
Take a trip: Sometimes visiting your parents’ home, or the place they died, can be a healing journey when you’re ready for it.
Let grief progress toward acceptance: As her trip concluded, Polson realized that she had needed to grieve, but that the best way to honor the loss of her parents was to accept their death, and to go on living herself.
Take care of yourself: When you are lost in grief, it’s easy to ignore basic care of yourself—eating well, getting some exercise, getting enough sleep.
Write: As you grieve, you may want to keep a journal or scrapbook in which you can write, or collect photos or memorabilia.

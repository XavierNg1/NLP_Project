Look at the unmarked lines on a metric ruler.The numbered lines represent centimeters, but the unmarked lines represent millimeters.
Place the “0” end of the ruler at the starting edge.
Read the numbered mark immediately before the ending edge.
Count the unnumbered lines after the last numbered mark.Count the number of millimeter marks in between the last numbered mark you just identified and the actual ending point of the object being measured.

Add the two values together to calculate the length in millimeters.

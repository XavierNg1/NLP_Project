Do not try reading the monologue 15 times a day.
Split up your monologue in to about 5 parts.
Say your monologue in front of a mirror looking at your reflection as much as you can.
Give yourself positive influence.
Give yourself time away from memorizing, your brain is a muscle, and like others, it gets stronger by rest.

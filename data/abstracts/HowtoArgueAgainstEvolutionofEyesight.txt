Point out that clearly evolution if it works is by failure of a previously successful part or system in genetic accidents called mutations.
"Describe a strictly reactive system that is disintegrated and lacking intelligence that forms interdependent, successful systems inadvertently--call it evolution.",
Examine a partly functional eye.
Observe needed simultaneous existence of the entire eye and all its functions plus the optic nerve from the eye to the brain and especially the sight center in the brain itself.
See that the a non-functional part of an eye would not enhance survival and so the eye should not exist at all as it is not logical to evolve in unsuccessful pieces.

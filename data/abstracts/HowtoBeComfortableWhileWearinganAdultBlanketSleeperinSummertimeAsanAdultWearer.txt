Modify your wardrobe on your blanket sleeper for summertime temperatures.
Unzip your blanket sleeper anytime you are wearing it.
Consider using an air conditioner in the room you will be wearing your blanket sleeper in.
Consider wearing lightweight cotton, ankle-high socks as opposed to any other style/any other full-length sock.
Don't wear your blanket sleeper's hood, if the garment contains one.
Consider wearing a cotton t-shirt under your sleeper, to soak up some of the sweat from your body.
Sleep on top of the sheets and blankets of your bed when you wear a blanket sleeper during the night when your body is "stable" from cooling and warming trends.

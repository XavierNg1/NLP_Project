Diagram any story shots in advance.
Stage each scene with actors/rappers/extras, then set up lights accordingly.
Keep your direction simple and loose, especially with extras.
Shoot 2-3 takes with the song playing and rapper rapping first.
Make sure the rapper is the focus of most shots.
Grab any story shots without sound to speed up the process.
Pick up B-roll, or extra shots that look cool, in the end.

Select a location that receives partial to full sun.
Loosen the soil by digging into it with a rake or chopping it up with a trowel.
Mix compost and sand into the soil.
Dig a hole that is as deep as the container you grew your seedling in.
Hold the seedling container on its side and gently squeeze or "wiggle" the jasmine out.
Place the bottom of the stem into the hole.
Give the growing site a generous watering to saturate the roots.
Insert a stake, bamboo pole, or trellis behind the jasmine.

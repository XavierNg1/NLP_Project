Decide on the height.
In addition to the 8 feet (2.4 m) above ground, you will also need about 2 feet (0.6 m) of pipe to drive into the ground; this is the support for the structure and also allows the above ground section to be removed and modified, or swiveled if you like.
Solder a simple coupler (sleeve) once the pipe is driven to an adequate depth, over the end of the pipe so the upper half of the structure can slide in and out of the coupler as needed and be supported by the pipe in the ground.

,
Decide how many "limbs" you want.
Prepare and add the actual limbs that you will hang the feeders or houses on.
Slide each arm into its respective "T" fitting, stand your pole with the limbs attached into the base coupler and you are ready to hang your feeders on the hooks.

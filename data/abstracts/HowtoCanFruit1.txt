Prepare the fruit for canning.
Clean 9 glass pint (500mL) canning jars and metal lids with soap and hot water.
Prepare a simple sugar syrup.Heat water to a boil and dissolve sugar in the following proportions:


For a very light syrup with the fewest amount of calories add 3/4 cup (180 mL) of sugar to 6 1/2 cups (1.5 L).
Fill the clean jars with the washed and prepared fruit.
Wipe the rims of the jars with a clean cloth, shake gently to allow air bubbles to escape and cover with the metal lids.
Place the cover securely on the canner and heat water to boiling.
Process jars in the pressure canner,adjusting the process time and pressure based on your altitude and the type of fruit you are canning.Start timing when the necessary pressure is reached.
Turn off heat and allow pressure to return to 0 PSI (0 kPa), then remove the weights or open the vent and wait for 2 minutes.
Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter and place them on a wooden board or thick kitchen towel to allow them to cool in a draft free area.
Label the jars with ingredients and the date, then store in a cool, dark and dry location.

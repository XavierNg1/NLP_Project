Teach your dog the boundaries of the electric dog fence.
Introduce your dog to the boundary.
With your dog on a lead, casually walk to the boundary of the electric fence where the flags are.
Repeat the same lesson on days two and three.
Do a real test.
Replace the Innotek plastic training contacts with the Innotek supplied metal correction contacts.
With your dog still on a lead, casually walk to the boundary of the electric dog fence with your dog and helper.
Retreat immediately to the safe part of the yard or pet containment area and lavish your dog with praise.
Continue this lesson at a number of different areas around the boundary of the electric fence.

Teach the dog to avoid distractions.
Go through a list of distractions that will tempt your dog to leave the pet containment area and prove each one before proceeding to the next.
Practice with the dog off lead but supervised.
Make sure the Innotek device is correctly placed on the dog collar and on your dog's neck and the electronic collar is turned on.

Stay with the dog when it's in the yard.
Teach the “off lead unsupervised” lesson.
Keep a close eye on your dog for two weeks from inside the house.
Before and after each unsupervised session in the pet containment area, continue the play and praise routine to continue to reinforce that the yard is a happy, fun and safe place to be.
Remove the flags.

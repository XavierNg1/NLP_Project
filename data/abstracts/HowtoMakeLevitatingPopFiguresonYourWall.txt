Make sure your box is undamaged and flat-sided, to avoid a messy looking display.
Empty the box and set the figure and plastic packaging to the side.

,
Connect two of the Velcro Command Strips together face-to-face, then remove the green liner from one side.
Cut a small piece of cardboard.
Tape the cardboard sliver under the command strip in the center of the box as shown.

,
Remove the other green liner from the Command strip on the box, then, using the level, place the box level where you want it on your wall.
Put the plastic packing frame back inside the box, for stability.
Close the box and leave it on the wall for a minimum of maybe ten minutes.
After the adhesive has cured, put the figure on top or back in the box, however you prefer it!,
Do this for as many figures as you like.

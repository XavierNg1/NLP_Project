Visit a home improvement store to find the appropriate ceiling fan light kit.
Turn off the circuit breaker that controls the power to your ceiling fan.
Unscrew the cap hiding the wires and set it aside.
Connect the light's wires to the fan's wires with wire nuts.This should be done by simply lining up the two matching wires so that they are parallel and screwing a wire nut on the end, like you would a lid on a bottle.
Screw the lighting assembly onto the ceiling fan.
Install light bulbs, glass shades, and pull chains, following the directions provided by the manufacturer.
Flip the circuit breaker back on, pull the chain, and check out your newly-improved fan!

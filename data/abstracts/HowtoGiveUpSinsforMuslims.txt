Stop indulging in sin.
Abstain from all sins, out of love for Allah Ta’ala.
Develop the conscious awareness that Allah Ta’ala is with us : He is watching us, He is hearing us, He knows all and everything about us; We cannot hide from Him; We cannot conceal our actions from Him.
Remember the angels too are witness to all our actions; that the earth is recording our behaviour and that all of it is also noted in our books of deeds – that we are accountable to Allah Ta’ala on the Day of Judgement.
Reflect daily.
Ponder over the fact that the Angel of Death does not give respite.
Ponder over the fact that Allah Ta’ala has blessed us with the gift of sight, hearing, health, wealth, and so much else – and has also granted us the gift of respect.
Contemplate on the consequences of such behaviour and a little bit of Mujahada – which entails ‘not doing’ and Alhamdulillah, the sicknesses are cured.
Attend the talks of the learned Scholars of Islam whenever possible, or listen to recordings of their talks and read their books to gain benefit of pious, righteous company.

Pre-heat your oven to 200°F (94°C).
Slice some oranges into ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) thick slices.
Bake the oranges in the oven for 4 hours, turning them every hour.
Buy a big bag of bay leaves and empty it into a large bowl.
Consider drilling holes through the middle of your cinnamon sticks.
Cut a 4-foot (1.22-meter) garland piece of twine, thread it through a yarn needle, and tie one end into a small loop.
Start stringing your orange slices, bay leaves, and cinnamon sticks onto the twine.
Repeat this pattern until you run out of items or the garland reaches the length you want.
Tie another loop at the end of the twine.

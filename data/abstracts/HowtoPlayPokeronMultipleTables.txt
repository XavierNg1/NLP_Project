Use a good quality optical mouse.Initially, multi-table with one big monitor or with an add-on monitor to your desktop or notebook.
Set up a second mouse, so when your shoulder gets tired, switch to a mouse on your other side.
For greater efficiency, use two computers and have a mouse for each.
To use two computers use either a switch or router to split your internet.

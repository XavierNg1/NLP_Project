Dress up your food.
Pretend so that the kids appreciate it more.
Tell the kids that the food is something that it is, well, not.
Have a small "Food Inventing" contest.
Tell your kids that if they eat some food on their plate that they do not like, they can have a treat such as staying up 5 minutes later.
First ask them about it.
Don't wolf your food down!,
Have a blind eating contest.

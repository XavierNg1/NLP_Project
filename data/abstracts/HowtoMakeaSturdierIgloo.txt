Mark out an area to build the Igloo in.
Before starting on building the actual Igloo, determine what kind of snow you are dealing with.
Find a mold to make the bricks out of.
Use a snow shovel to fill the mold with snow, then pack it down.
Clear snow out of the area where the igloo will be built: it will make sure the igloo does not become uneven as the surrounding snow begins to melt and refreeze.

,
After you have the mold filled, turn it upside down at the site of the igloo where you want the brick placed.
Remember to leave a small area (about a two feet wide and two feet tall) at the base open for a door.

,
Continue adding layers, steadily sloping inward.
Build a cap.
Feel free to make smaller(or not) igloos joined to your first one by tunnels for multiple sleeping quarters/storage.

,
Consider adding a chimney.

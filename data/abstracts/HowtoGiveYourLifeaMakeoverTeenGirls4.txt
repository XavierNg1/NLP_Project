Take the time to make sure your hair is nice, straighten it the night before or sleep with curling ribbons, wake up a little bit earlier to do that cool braid thing you liked.

Makeup: Cover any blemishes with a concealer a shade lighter than your natural skin tone and if you have dark circles under your eyes, apply some there too.

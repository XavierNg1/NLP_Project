Find a batting stance that suits you.
Watch.
Some hitters will commonly drop their hands, meaning that instead of going in a diagonal path to the ball with your hands and bat like you should, the hitter will let his hands drop and swing in a straight line, resulting in either a swing and miss or a pop-up.
As you swing, your head may naturally turn away before the point of contact, ready to see where the ball went.
If you have followed all of these directions, you have probably made good contact with the ball on the sweet spot of the bat and you are now in a great position to do some damage to the other team.
As you end your swing, make sure you don't feel like your back foot has to move immediately.
Done.

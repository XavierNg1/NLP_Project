Know that the simplest system has an input and an output.
Show a system by a box.
Remember a system without a feedback in engineering notation is like the one shown in the image.Manipulate the last result to get (see the image above)

,
Show, then, with the same formal notations onwards.Manipulate the last result to get (see the image above)

,
Note that the ratio Y(s) / X(s), whatever it is, is called the transfer function.
Keep in mind that you can have an equation, 1 + H(s)G(s) = 0.
Remember.
Remember also that a complex rational function is the ratio of two complex complex polynomials.
Compare the ratio Y(s) / X(s) in two systems without feedback and with feedback to see what is the effect of the feedback in a system.

,
Do a simple calculation to convince you that the feedback function can be gobbled into the input before the comparison point.

,
Observe the simple feedback.Write equation 2, then as (see the image above)

,
Separate gain K. It is better to separate gain of the system as an independent block.Write, then, equation 3 as (see the image above)

,
Note that the denominator determines stability of the system.
Calculate the magnitude (modulus) and angle (argument) of G(s).
Remember G(s) is a rational function; that is, equal to a polynomial divided by a polynomial both in the same variable s. Hence,

,
Observe that, generally, it is not easy to find roots of a polynomial of degree greater than three or four and write it out in its roots factors, as it is done in Equation 5.
Begin from the simplest system.
Remember.
Solve a similar Root Locus for the control system depicted in the feedback loop here.
Ask questions regarding K.

,
Begin from K = 0.
Increase K. You have still two real roots, until K = 1 / 4, where two roots will be equal; that is s1 = s2 = â€“ 1 / 2.

,
Increase K > 1 / 4.
Know the meaning of things happening in complex plane.
Note that the complex plane is not like the real line.
Evaluate arbitrary test point s1 with respect to the root of polynomial s + 2 = 0.
Assume you have certain number of the real roots on the real line.
Remember the characteristic function for the general feedback loop was 1 + G(s)H(s) = 0.
Recognise a proper system.
Know the meaning of branches.

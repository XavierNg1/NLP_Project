Select a book, preferably a thick one with a sturdy hard cover.
Select the first few pages that you want to have free at the end of the project (plus one more) and hold them to the front cover with plastic food wrap so they do not get messed up with the glue.
Mix a solution of white glue and water.
Now that you have the top cover and the first couple of pages wrapped in food wrap, brush the three edges of the book with the glue solution so that it is reasonably absorbed.
Place something heavy on top of the book so as to apply pressure.
Open the book to reveal the first glued page.
Cut along the inside of the drawn line with a straight edge knife (a box cutter works especially well).
Continue cutting through the layers.
Brush the glue solution onto the inside edges of the hole and allow it to soak in.
Brush the "frame" of the hole with a light coat of glue.
Close the book again, this time without any spacers.
Cut the saved page neatly along the edges of the hole so that the hole is visible and accessible once again.
Check to make sure every part of the book is thoroughly dry.

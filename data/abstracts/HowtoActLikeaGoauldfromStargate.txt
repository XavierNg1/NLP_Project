The Goa'uld are megalomaniacs.
They believe others are below them, thus they are extremely arrogant.
Behaving like a Goa'uld is a lot about perception and presence.
If you look at a Goa'uld like Apophis and the way they took SG, they had clothing that looked inspired by Ancient Egypt, but took it a bit far and made it look more sci-fi than anything.
Either style is fine, many prefer the look of the sci-fi, other die hard fans of the movie will prefer the traditional look.
If you look at the MMO that was in development, Stargate Worlds, you can decide how you would operate based on the three (the first two are the important ones here) Goa'uld play styles.

,
Servant Lord: This is the one that would wear the elaborate style clothing, relying mainly on their technology and troops to own their enemies.
Battle Lord: This is the style that you mostly see Apophis in when he goes off to another world or on a mission.
Looking more in-depth at it, you could say the characters from Unreal Championship were based on Stargate characters.
Acting like a Goa'uld is mainly about your presence and your look.
However, this will probably lead to most people just thinking you are a jerk.
Goa'uld do not take crap from anyone unless they think it will benefit them.
Goa'uld would be rich.
Goa'uld strength comes from their followers as well, battle lord or servant lord.
These are just a few guidelines, but to be taken as fun.

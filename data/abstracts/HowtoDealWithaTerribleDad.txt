Accept the fact that we don't choose our parents.
Release any guilt you feel by acknowledging that your dad is not a good parent role model for you.
Understand it is not your problem other than you are forced to live and deal with him.
Avoid big, dramatic blow ups with him.
Work hard at pleasing yourself in life.
Look around you for good men who could become a father figure to you.
Stay strong.
Tell him.

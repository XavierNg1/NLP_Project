Prep your hair.
Pull hair into a ponytail, using an elastic band to keep it loosely in place.








,
Separate your hair into two equal sections.
Use your fingers to separate a small piece of hair from the outside of the right section.
Take a piece of hair from the outside of the left section, roughly the same size as the first piece.
Continue this pattern, always passing a small piece from the outside of one section to the inside of the other section, alternating right and left.
Use an elastic band to secure the tip of the braid.








,
Remove the elastic at the top of the braid, either by stretching it and pulling it down over the braid or very carefully snipping it with a pair of scissors.
Finished.

Enter to cell D2 the formula, without quotes, "=Y_Offset"
Enter to cell C3 the formula, without quotes, "=C2+ShrinkExpand"
Enter to cell D3 the formula, without quotes, "=D2"

,
Enter the Cosine (x) and Sine (y) formulas and fill down:


Enter to cell A2 the formula, w/o quotes, "=X_Offset+COS((ROW()-2)*PI()/180)*ShrinkExpand"
Enter to cell B2 the formula, w.o quotes, "=Y_Offset+SIN((ROW()-2)*PI()/180)*ShrinkExpand"
Edit Go To cell range A2:B362
Do Edit Fill Down

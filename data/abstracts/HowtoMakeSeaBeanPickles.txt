Sterilize your jars.
Fill the jars half full with water.
Get your ingredients together.Make a cocktail of 1/2 water, 1/2 vinegar (figure out how much you’ll need to fill the jars), and boil.Get the jars out of microwave, empty the water.
While that heats up, place a sprig (mostly leaves) of dill and optional garlic clove in the bottom of each jar, and then fill with sea beans.Once vinegar boils, fill jars, leaving 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) at the top of each.Place lids on jars, making sure the edges are clean.
Now one more boil, place jars in a pot with water to 3/4 height of jar.
Done!

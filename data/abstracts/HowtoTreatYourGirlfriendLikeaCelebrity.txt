Respect her!,
Listen to what she says.
If she's going to audition, go with her!,
Bring her little gifts, on ever occasion.
Hold hands in public, no matter how silly you feel.
Try something new with her!,
If she sings and you sing, sing a song together at a choir performance or anywhere your allowed to legally sing!,
Prepare lots of dates.
Make sure the love is true to you and her.

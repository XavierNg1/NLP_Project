Keep stairways safe.
Keep your home well-lit.If your home is well-lit you will be more likely to see objects in front of you that could cause you to fall.
Use appropriate safety equipment when working on your house.For instance, if youâ€™re working on your roof, you should wear a helmet and slip-resistant boots.
Clean up spills.If the floor is wet or greasy, someone could step in the spill and slip, leading to a concussion.
Play on soft ground.If you have a home playground set in your backyard, install woodchips or sand below it.

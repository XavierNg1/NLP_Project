Imagine your ideal self.
Uncover your greatest attributes.
Affirm yourself.
Stop comparing yourself to others.When you peek over in your neighborâ€™s business and find that he is excelling in some area that you are not, you may feel discontented with yourself.
Say goodbye to self-criticism.If you have a tendency to beat yourself up, end it today.

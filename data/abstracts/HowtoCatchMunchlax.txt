If you are playing Diamond and Pearl, get some Honey from the man in Floaroma Meadow for 100 Pok√©mon Dollars.
Slather honey on a tree.
Since Munchlax trees have a 1% chance of attracting a Munchlax, and you don't know which are Munchlax trees, slather honey on the same tree until a Munchlax appears.
If you are playing HeartGold and SoulSilver, there is a Snorlax at Route 11.

One thing you should do is get acquainted with poetry.
Write down key words on a scrap sheet of paper on what you are feeling.
Then, jot down all the things that could be used, or could relate, to what you wrote down before.
Think about what you wrote down just now, and think of the ways they can connect.
Combine these ideas with a certain event in history or a certain circumstance.
Not all poems need to rhyme or adhere to poetic forms.
Some people prefer a muse.
Now, begin to write.
Lastly, when you are finished, read it a couple of times, edit it a bit, and be proud of it.
Whether it's a haiku or an epic trilogy, remember to always put your heart into it.

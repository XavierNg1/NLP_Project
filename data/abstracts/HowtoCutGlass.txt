Set up your work area.
Clean the glass surface in the area where you plan to make cuts.
Obtain a glass cutter and some light oil.
Measure and mark where you want to score.
Dip the cutter in the oil and grasp it like a pencil.
Lay out a straight edge.
Apply pressure to the glass and you pull the cutter along the surface, rolling on the small carbide wheel.
Run the cutter smoothly from one edge to the other.
Check your score.
Grasp each side of the cut carefully in your hands.
Apply minor pressure from the wrist to break the glass along your score.
Use fine sandpaper or a sharpening stone to remove the sharp edge.
Follow a pattern that connects to the edge.
Use several straight lines to cut a sharp curve.
Flip the glass over and gently press on the center of your score from the backside.
Make some relief cuts to remove small pieces at a time instead of all at once.
Smooth your curved edges using a glass router.

There is a German saying: "Wer nicht k√§mpft hat schon verloren" which basically means "Who doesn't fight has already lost.",
Keep an eye on her body language for that is very important.
Attempt to have some private time with her, such as taking a walk with her and other innocent, sweet activities similar to that.
Talk to her and find out what you two have in common.
Send her a sweet love letter or a rose.
Once you're positive that the girl is interested in you, ask her out on a date, but remember not to appear desperate or frightened.
Ask her to go to the city or the cinema with you.
When on a date with the girl, remember the first rule: Never look at her below the neck.

Find a sock you don't care about.
Cut the toes off the sock using a pair of scissors.
Roll the sock into a ring.
Pull your hair up into a high ponytail.
Spray your ponytail with just enough water to make it slightly damp.
Slip the ponytail through the sock ring.
Tuck the hair around the sock evenly.
Roll the hair onto the sock.
Continue rolling your hair around the sock until you reach the base of the ponytail, directly next to your head.
Remove the sock bun in the morning and style your hair if you need to.

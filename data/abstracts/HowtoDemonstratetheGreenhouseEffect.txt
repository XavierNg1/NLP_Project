Lay a very dark colored cutting board (or tile or other sinkable, waterproof flat surface) into a shallow baking tray.
Put enough cool (ocean temperature) water so that 1/8th of an inch or so is above the cutting board, and there are no dry spots on the surface.

,
Set up a 'drop-light' in so that it shines onto the water surface, but absolutely not in or above it.
This is your ocean.
Get 2 plastic baggies: one tinted (usually freezer) bag and one clear (usually sandwich) bag.
Fit the baggie corners into the glass, open, as if to make a liner for the glass.
Teaching point number two here: the air in each glass and the baggie lining is our atmosphere.
Now we get to see what happens.
Watch!,
If a glass moves, give it a little silverware corral , pull them out, make sure the water is still equally deep in the pan and start over.
As the experiment goes on, teaching points abound: The light and heat in the glasses immediately started piling up, trapping more and more pressure in the glass until it starts streaming out from under the rims.
The bubbling slows through 3-5 minutes, during which you can ask pointed questions: What do you see?,
Now you can turn off the lamp, and let the whole thing cool.
Look at the water in the glasses, now that they are cooled off.
This should have sparked a good conversation about climate science.

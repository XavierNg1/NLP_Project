Have an interest in music- There's no point in acting like your musical when you have no interest in it whatsoever.
Have some musical talent- It helps if you actually have some musical talent, e.g.
Always be listening to music- Try carrying around an iPod/music player.
Dress the part- Music is a form of art, it's expressing yourself, as is your fashion sense, so make an effort to look the part.
Get the natural look- When it comes to hair and makeup, keep it natural.
Don't care what others think- If you want to listen to Mozart then you listen to Mozart.
Lets others see your talent- If you're an amazing singer or can play the guitar really well or whatever your talent, then get out there and show the world.

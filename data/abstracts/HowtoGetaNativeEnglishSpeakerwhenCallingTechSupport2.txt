If you do happen to get through to an agent that you have trouble understanding, you may be able to ask for a transfer.
Be polite and answer the basic questions asked by the agent such as your name, phone number, and nature of your issue.
Attempt to work with the agent before requesting a transfer.
Ask nicely for a transfer if you are unable to work constructively with the agent.
When you get the new agent on the line, thank the original agent for their assistance, and then begin to explain your issue to the new agent.

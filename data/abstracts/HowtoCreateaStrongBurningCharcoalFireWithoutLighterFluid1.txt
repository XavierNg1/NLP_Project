Know that inexpensive chimney starters are the easiest way to get a strong fire every time.
Load the bottom of the chimney starter with lightly balled newspaper.
Fill the top of the starter fully with charcoal briquets.
Light the paper in several place from the bottom and set it on your grill.
Dump the coals on the grill when the top pieces are covered gray.
Make sure the vents are open for a larger fire.

In order to be a great merchant, you have to start small.
Finish the tutorial, "Unstable Foundations," by choosing to mine through the rocks.
Complete quest "The Blood Pact.",
Bank everything you've received from the quest except for the sword.
Wield the sword, then start killing chickens at the chicken/sheep farm North of Lumbridge.
Complete quest "The Cook's Assistant.",
Cook the chickens on the castle range.
Get all non-combat levels to 30, save for Mining (you're allowed to mine Rune Essences) and Smithing.
Now sell all of your valuable items to the Grand Exchange.
Start for your explorer ring.
Now mine copper and tin and make Bronze Bars until your mining and smithing are both 12.
Complete "The Knight's Sword.",
Raise all of your levels, save for useless levels like prayer (and member levels), until you have a solid account.
Here is where you start the clan.
Remember, you are a merchanting clan.
Again, this is a direction guide, speaking generally.
Sell like your workers.
When you've reached 100M, thank this guide and every other resource you've used.

Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking soda.
Beat the butter in a separate bowl until it becomes light and fluffy.
Beat the white and brown sugar for about 2 minutes.
Whisk in the vanilla extract and the milk.
Beat in the flour mixture.
Fold in the chocolate chips using a rubber spatula.
Chill the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes, if necessary.
Roll the dough into 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) balls and place them onto the baking sheet.
Gently flatten each ball until they are about ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick.
Bake the cookies for 10 to 12 minutes.
Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire cooling rack.

Decide what kind of poem you would like to write.
Find a source of inspiration such as nature, a strong emotion, a beautiful or engaging image.
Come up with one word or topic (from your source of inspiration) and list words or phrases associated with that topic, for example, for "love," red roses, white doves, love letters/poems, light, hope, romance, family/friends, etc.
Even in "confessional" or personal poetry, don't just write about emotions.
Pay attention to strong or unusual images as you go about your life.
Use a thesaurus.
When you've finished your first draft, read it over and see if you've been unnecessarily repetitive.
If you didn't start with a title, read over what you've written and write a title that either introduces, sums up, or perhaps gives a twist on what the poem says.
You have become a "poet"!

Purchase a "fiberglass kit.",
Think of a mold for your fiberglass.
Use foam or pliable materials for molds with organic shapes.
Use cardboard, plywood, MDF, or other stiff materials for molds with linear or geometric shapes.
Prepare the fiberglass mat or cloth in sheets cut to suitable sizes to cover your form, allowing for plenty of overlap where you need to join it at corners or sharp curves.
Measure an appropriate amount of resin in a metal container.
Add the hardener, according to package instructions.
Stir this material thoroughly, being careful to stir the bottom and sides, and not just the middle of the container, using a paint stick.

,
Lay mat on or in your form, and spread the resin mixture over it with a disposable paint brush.
Work the mat and resin completely over your form until it is covered uniformly.
Clean up any tools or spills with a solvent containing acetone before the material hardens.
Repeat the steps of applying mat and resin until the finished project is as thick as you want it.
Finish your project by coating with gel coat or a smooth coat of resin.
Remove your fiberglass from the form.

Recognize that the best marketing campaigns began long before the book is published.
Think about one to two specific groups of people your writing is geared towards.
Provide twice weekly blogs, photos, tweets, or other content to build a fan base.
Build a mailing list online, through your website, or in-person at reading events.
Nurture a following in your community long before asking them to buy your book.
Give away printed and physical materials (postcards, bookmarks, posters, business cards) to put your name out there.
Consider offering pre-orders if your community seems interested.

Hold your pen/pencil properly.Many people grip the pen too hard in an effort to gain control over their strokes, but that often results in sore hands which lead to sloppy writing.
Engage your whole arm when writing.
Practice with simple lines and circles.
Move on to writing individual letters.Once youâ€™ve gotten comfortable using the proper posture, hand grip, and writing motion with your lines and circles, you should turn your attention to actual letters.
Practice writing out entire paragraphs.
Take it slow.
Write by hand whenever possible.

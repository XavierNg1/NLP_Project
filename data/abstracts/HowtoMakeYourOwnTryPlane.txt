Rip the timber down to size on your band saw.



 

Plane all the pieces flat and true with a jointer plane.
Set aside the cheeks and start laying out lines for cutting the centre block into two pieces - the bed block and the toe block.





Make two cuts along the marked angles using the table saw and its mitre gauge.Clean up the bed with a sharp block plane and ensure that it is perfectly flat.Make a small chamfer (bevel) on the leading edge of the bed block to prevent it from chipping , then set the bed block aside.





Lay out the throat on the toe block (front block).
Lay out the wedge abutment on the toe block (front block).





Cut the throat.





Make the iron plate, as you will need it to check the opening of the mouth.





Position the front block so the iron won’t protrude through the mouth when you glue up the pieces.
Remove the clamps from the plane and scrape off any glue squeeze out.Draw a line on the top of the plane from the front edge of the abutments to the back of the throat where the cheeks touch the centre blocks.
Remove this material using a rasp and tidy it up with a chisel.





Layout a line from the toe 30mm above the sole to the throat using a large French curve.
,
Cut along this line and remove the waste using the bandsaw.





Cut a wedge on the bandsaw from an off-cut of timber to a width of 60mm and an angle of 10°.
Test-fit the wedge with the iron in place, and check where it beds against the abutments.





Sketch out your design and remove the waste using drills and the band saw.
,





Shape the handle to a comfortable fit, testing it with your hand.





Mark out the mortise on the rear of the plane.





Mark out the final chamfers along the sides of the plane and cut them using a spokeshave.





Sand the plane and apply the finish.





Turn a small rosewood knob 25mm in diameter by 50mm deep on the lathe.





Sharpen the iron and set it in place.





Take a test cut; does it give a full-width shaving?

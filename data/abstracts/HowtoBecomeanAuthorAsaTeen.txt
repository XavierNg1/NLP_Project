Get an idea.
Try making a plot out of it.
Come up with your characters and their identity: full name and profession.
Sit down on your computer, in a reasonably calm environment otherwise you won't be able to concentrate and will get distracted easily.
Try writing at least 1000 words everyday.
Edit.
You may stop at step 6 if you were writing for fun or as a hobby.
Either find a literary agent or send your story directly to the publisher.
If a publisher doesn't accept your story, don't give up.

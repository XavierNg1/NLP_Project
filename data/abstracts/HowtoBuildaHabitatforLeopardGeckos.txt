You need to think about where your gecko will live.
Substrate is what you put at the bottom of the tank.
Leopard geckos need heat to digest their food.
You'll want to keep accurate thermometers (the most accurate being digital ones with a probe or temperature guns) in the tank so you can keep a close eye on the temperatures.
As for furnishings, there should be two hiding places on the hot side of the tank and one on the cooler side.
You gecko will need a water dish and a food dish if feeding meal worms.

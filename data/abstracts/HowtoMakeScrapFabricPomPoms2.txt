Cut a 1Â½-inch (3.81-centimeter) circle out of felt.
Use the felt circle to trace more circles onto your choice of fabric.
Cut the fabric circles out.
Pinch the middle of a fabric circle so that it scrunches up into a cone-shaped flower.
Put a drop of hot glue on the tip of the scrunched fabric.
Press the flower glue-side-down against the felt circle.
Continue pinching and gluing fabric flowers to the felt circle.
Consider making a round pom pom.

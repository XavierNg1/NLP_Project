Before we start, let's get an understanding of what happens when we strike an arc with welding electrodes.
Prepare The Bevels and Lands

Prepare to clean the steel plates by donning your safety equipment, welding helmet, welding gloves and a dust mask for particles.
Set The Root Gap

When the bevel has been applied to both steel plates, turn them face down, set the root gap (I use the metal stub of the welding electrode I'm welding with) and employ spot welding to tack them into position.

,
Position The Steel Plates

Now that the plates have been cleaned, beveled and tacked, clamp the steel plate in a position of comfort and prepare to weld the root pass.
Preheat The Steel Plates

It is never a bad Idea to preheat, in fact, almost every welding job I perform professionally demands a preheat temp of 400 degrees and up.
Run The Root Pass

Extra care should be taken when running the root pass because If the root pass has good fusion and is watertight, the rest of the welding is just formality especially when welding pipe.
Run The Fill Passes

Run the welds in steps starting with the root pass, the intermediate fill pass and the final fill.

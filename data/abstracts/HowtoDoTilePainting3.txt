Decide on your colors and/or design.
Transfer your design to the tile very lightly using a pencil before you start to paint.
After you've outlined your designs (if any), paint the surface following your template.
Let the paint dry for 48 hours on large home projects and 24 hours for small, decorative art pieces.

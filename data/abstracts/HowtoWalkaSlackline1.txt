Start with a short slackline.
Place one foot lengthwise in the middle of the slackline.
You can mount the slackline at any point, but starting in the middle is generally safer, since it is usually away from obstacles you might hit when falling.
Take a couple deep breaths and settle yourself.
Focus intently on a single point, such as the anchor.
Put your arms out wide, slightly bent and keep an upright posture.

,
Center your weight directly over the foot on the line.
Balance on one foot, while using your arms and other leg to help maintain your balance.

,
Bend the leg that is on the slackline.
Continue to wave your free arms and legs around to help you balance.
Repeat these steps until you can balance for at least 15 seconds.

,
Practice with the other foot.
Once you've successfully taken your first step, keep practicing!

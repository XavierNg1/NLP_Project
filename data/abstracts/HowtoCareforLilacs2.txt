Apply a layer of compost under and around the base of the plant in early spring.
Donâ€™t over fertilize your plants.
Feed them once per year in later winter with a 10-10-10 fertilizer if the soil is poor.
Consider placing some well-rotted manure and lime near the base of the plant after it flowers.

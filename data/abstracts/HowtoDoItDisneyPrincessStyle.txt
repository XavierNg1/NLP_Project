Decide what kind of princess you'd like to be.
Be friends with all creatures.
Hair.
Sing, sing, sing!,
Figure.
Be sweet and curious - like Ariel when she went into town with Prince Eric for the first time or Snow White when the disguised queen offers her the poisoned apple.
Be graceful and accepting to comments of your loveliness; don't be vain and shallow.
Your eyes, skin and lips should also be perfect -- even if you've just gotten out of bed or are mourning over the assumed death of your prince.
Clothing.
Romance.
Do not be evil!,
Speak up.
Be proud.

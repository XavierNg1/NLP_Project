Realize that simple solutions rarely work when it comes to losing weight.
Look for warnings on the diet.
Step aside from any weight loss or diet program that suggest you don't need to exercise.
Don't take any diet or weight loss regime seriously when it suggests that you can only eat certain foods at certain times of the day.
Beware any diet that suggests that you should cut out whole food groups.
Take care when a diet is based on what people used to do.
Avoid diets that use foods that are difficult to obtain.
Do some research.
Be suspicious of any diet guru claiming to have solved weight loss problems and claims that trained diet professionals are in the dark or misguided.
Consider how easy or hard it is to stick to the program.

Start by examining what you feel is a quality experience in your own life.
Further explore the varieties of this dissatisfaction.
Consider times that you have found satisfaction in doing something by yourself.
Consider the alternative cases where you are prepared to pay whatever the cost is.
Think about this: Proportionate to the attachment or passion you have with anything is equal to the dangers most people are willing to go to, this is most self-evident in wars.
Consider experiences you've had where simple or free things seemed to have the most value.
Beware of the extremes in order to best make changes in your life to give the most benefit.
Try to find ways to improve the quality of your life and make it fun, without their being a harm factor.

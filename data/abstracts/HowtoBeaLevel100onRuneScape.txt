When you've just started Runescape, you should find yourself in a small town called Lumbridge.
Take the path towards the west.
Go east until you see a path heading north.
Now, go back to Varrock.
Go back to Lumbridge, find a smelting room and smelt them into bronze bars.
Use your bars with the anvils.
Put your new equipment on.
Now go back to Lumbridge.
Now go to the barbarian village and train on women barbarian.
Go to Lumbridge and around the palace.
Now go to Varrock and take your tinderbox.

Choose 3 pairs of baby socks.
Roll each sock into a rosebud.
Wrap florist’s wire around the center of the rosebud.
Pull gently on the top of the rosebud to loosen the “petals.” This will make the baby sock blooms look fuller.

,
Bend the wire at a 90° angle right against the sock fabric.
Arrange the blooms.
Wrap the twisted wire in florist’s tape for added security.

Plan a Long-Expected Party with fellow hobbit fans!,
Decide where to hold the party.
Make sure that your festivities include a good amount of food â€“ either a large meal or various snack foods.
Choose a passage or more about hobbits from one of Tolkien's books to read aloud together.
Play games.
Have a special cake.
Give away lovely things to everyone who comes to the party.
If you do not think your friends would be very interested in a Hobbit Day celebration, celebrate the day in your own way.

Remember that you are Cecil, captain of the Red Wings, on your ship flying back to Baron.
On the way back you will be engaged in battle.
Baigan will greet you and see you to the King.
Head to your quarters.
You will meet Namingway.
Once you find the cave, go on in.
You will release the Bomb Ring and sadly, destroy all of Mist.
After that battle with the little girl, you will see a thingy separating you from Mist.
You should head to Kaipo now, it is easy to find.
While you are resting, some Baron knights will come in and try to kill the little girl.
With that out of the way.
When Cecil gets up, head to the house on the top right corner.

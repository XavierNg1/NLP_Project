Check the title of the application/video carefully.
If you are suspect of the video but want to watch it, open it up, pause it immediately and look at the comments.
If you have got past this point, the chances are the video/app is not a screamer.
If you have gone past all these points safely, you are free to watch the video, although still be on alert and if it says 'watch closely or turn your sound up' exit!

Any videos which are too short are probably screamers.

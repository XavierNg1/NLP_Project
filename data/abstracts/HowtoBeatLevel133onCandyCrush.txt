Use the top half of the playing board to create multiple special candies that can help clear the jelly squares at the bottom.
Try to save color bombs and vertical striped candies so you can match them with one another, if possible.
Match candies the traditional way if any possible matches exist in the single rows in the bottom half of the playing board.
Try to position or drop any horizontal striped candies you make into the bottom half of the playing board, if possible.
Note the colors of candies positioned at the end of the swirls at the bottom half of the board before detonating color bombs.

Look into why your horse is bony in the first place.
Develop a good seat.
Consider purchasing a bareback pad.
If you've never ridden bareback before, consider trying it for the first time on a less bony horse - for maximum comfort the first time, go for a fat, or at least broad backed horse, preferably shorter and easy to control.
Try riding your own horse.
Recuperate.
Move on to trotting, jumping, galloping, and anything else you'd like to try doing without a saddle.

Choose the right kind of muzzle for your situation.
Measure your dog for a good fit.
Reward your dog for showing any interest in the muzzle.
Use the muzzle as a treat dispenser.
Smear peanut butter or cream cheese on the muzzle and freeze it.
Make sure your dog is completely comfortable with (if not excited about) the muzzle before moving to the next part.
While your dog is eating or licking treats with its nose in the muzzle, lift the strap that goes around the neck.
Try holding the strap up while the dog eats the treat.
Wrap the strap around your dog's neck and hold it as if was closed.
Secure the strap.
Put the muzzle on whenever you're going to do something that your dog enjoys.
Gradually increase the time your dog spends wearing the muzzle.

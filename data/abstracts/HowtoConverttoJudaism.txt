Understand that, like any religious conversion, converting to Judaism is a big step.
Research Jewish laws, history and customs, and talk to Jews about their religion.
Speak with your family about your intention to convert.
If you are converting because of marriage, speak with your future husband/wife to determine the best course of action, including what denomination you will join.
Once you feel that you have sufficient reason to convert, make an appointment with a rabbi to discuss the process.
Unlike in many religions, converting to Judaism is not fast or easy.
At the end of your studies, you will take a test to determine how much you've learned.
If you have passed all these steps, a conversion ceremony will be scheduled.
Children born prior to the end of conversion do not become Jews if their parent converts.

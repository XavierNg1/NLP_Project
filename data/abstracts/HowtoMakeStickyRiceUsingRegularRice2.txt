Do not rinse the rice before you cook it.
Consider letting the rice soak in a pot of water before you cook it.
Fill a large pot with 2 cups (450 milliliters) of water and add a few extra tablespoons of water.
Add 1 Â½ cups (300 grams) of short-grain rice or 1 cup (200 grams) of medium or long-grain rice.
Bring the water to a boil over high heat.
Reduce the heat once the water is boiling, and let the rice simmer for 10 minutes.
Turn the heat off once the rice has absorbed all of the water.
Leave the pot, covered, on the stove for 10 more minutes.Rice gets stickier the longer you let it sit.
Serve the rice.

Do things that help you make a break with the past.
Consider getting a new look.
Go out with your friends.
Realize that while it's tempting to imagine that your lost relationship was your one and only love, this is your sorrow talking.
Reflect on what happened in as objective way as possible.
Make a list of things you always wanted to do and never did.
Start something new.
Above all, be happy.

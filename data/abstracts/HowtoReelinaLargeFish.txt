Let the rod do the work once you know you have solidly hooked the fish.
Work the fish closer and closer to you by pulling the rod tip up, then reeling rapidly as you drop the tip down.
Use the space around you if you are fishing from shore.
Wear out big fish before landing them on the boat.
Use the boat to your advantage.
Use a harness.
Let the fish run when it is to your advantage.
For any type of fish or tackle, the line must be always tight so the fish will not throw the hook.
Stop a running fish when necessary.

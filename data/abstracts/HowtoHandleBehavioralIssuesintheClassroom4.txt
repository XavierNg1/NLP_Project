Although it is not a good idea to ignore negative behavior, it is important to approach students who are misbehaving without overreacting (Evertson 137).
Give a quiet signal if they are acting inappropriately.
Thank the students who are behaving well.
Provide a clear alternative.
When students begin using a better behavior, consolidate the gain.
Always listen well and seek to understand.

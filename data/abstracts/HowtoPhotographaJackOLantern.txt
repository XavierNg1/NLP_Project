Photograph the pumpkin promptly after you have carved it.
Set up the Jack-o'-Lantern.
Light the Jack-o'-Lantern.
Steady the camera.
Use a setting and/or film for low light, if you have the choice.
Turn out the lights.

Move the candle, pumpkin, and camera so that you see reflected light rather than light directly from the candle.
Take the photo, making sure not to move the camera.

Try a few photos with the lights on too, especially if you have any special effects or intricate carving details you'd like to show off.

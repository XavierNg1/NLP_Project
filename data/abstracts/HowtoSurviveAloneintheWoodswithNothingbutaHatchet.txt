Be calm in the situation: You are your most valuable resource.
Go to your nearest source of water: If you do not know where that is, then go downhill until you find a moving, clean source.
Wet stick: Once you find a river you can make a traditional wet stick.
Create a shelter: Build it with a small silhouette in mind as the larger it is the more it will catch wind.
Use that axe: Once you have a relatively permanent position you have around three weeks in which you can use the axe before food deprivation can kill you or make you severely sick.
Search for large amounts of dry wood that can easily be dragged to your shelter.
You can use your axe to chop off spruce boughs.
The only real significant source of fat and protein in the wild is that of meat.
You can use your axe to make a waterproof shelter.
Keep an eye out for game trails; avoid those that are large as they support larger predatory threat.
Look for things you can use.
To stay warm at night, get up off the ground.
If your source of water is a river all you have to do is follow it downhill to find a road or town.
It pays to be prepared before you move.
Never revert to a state of apathy or indifference as the world is only as merciful as you make it.

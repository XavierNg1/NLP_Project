Choose your food containers carefully.
Provide a variety of food.Rats have particular palettes and should be able to make some choices about what food they want to eat.
Introduce new foods slowly.If a rat eats too much of a food that disagrees with their constitution, they might have stomachaches or diarrhea.
Ensure your rat is getting an adequate amount of food.
Permit natural behaviors.

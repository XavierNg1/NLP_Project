Decide what color(s) to add to your mortar.
Choose a do-it-yourself masonry stain kit, and get help with an initial color mix recipe.
Make sure your mortar is clean and dry.
Wait until the temperature is above 40° Fahrenheit (4° Celsius).
Protect yourself.
Test the recipe.
Prepare your chosen mixture according to the manufacturer’s directions, and dip your brush.
Start staining the bed (or horizontal) mortar joints with a smooth, continuous, pulling motion.
Stain the head (or vertical) mortar joints that connect the rows you just stained with a single smooth stroke for each joint.
Touch up any spots you missed.
Dip the brush and repeat the process.
Check your work carefully to make sure you’ve colored all the mortar.

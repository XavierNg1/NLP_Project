Place a pan on the stove, heating it on medium heat.
Add some oil or butter to the pan as it gets warm.
Allow the pan to warm up until the butter/oil is hot, but not browning.
Break the first egg into a small dish or bowl and pour it in, or crack the egg right in the pan.
Cook the eggs, undisturbed, until the clear edges turn white.
Cover the pan and lower the heat once the edges have turned white.
Observe the hardness of the yolk by lifting the pan lid and gently poking it with your finger.
Lift the egg out of the pan with a quick, firm slide of the spatula.

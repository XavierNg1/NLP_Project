Talk to your allergic friend about your relationship post-pet.
Don't forget to call and make plans with your friend.

Discuss your future with your friend.
If your future together doesn't look promising, or you do resent the changes to your life (or your family or partner does), be straightforward about it - there are other potential BFFs out there who don't have pets, and your friend might be better off cutting his or her losses and finding other people who will fill his or her life in an easy, happy way.

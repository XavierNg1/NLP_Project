Start with thirty minutes of barefoot activity a day for 3-4 weeks.This will give your feet a chance to develop thicker skin for running at higher speeds and for longer times.
Make minimalist running shoes if it's cold outside, or you're concerned about your feet getting cut, but really it is best if you don't have to use these minimalist shoes.
Watch ahead, but don't look down.
Pay attention to your form.
Take shorter strides.
Lift your feet more quickly, and earlier than regular running.
Don't stop abruptly, the way most do when they are wearing shoes.

Drill a 1/2" diameter hole in the rock about 18" deep.
Clean out the hole.
Pour about 3/4 of a fluid ounce of gunpowder into the hole using a small funnel.
Place an appropriate length of cannon fuse in the hole.
Backfill the remaining hole by balling up modeling clay into 1/8" balls, dropping them into the hole, and tamping them down with a 1/4" wooden dowel.
Place sandbags tightly around the hole.

,
Make sure that nobody is in the area, light the fuse, and then EVACUATE.

Notes: You can adjust the hole depth, powder charge, and hole distance from the rock face to meet your requirements.

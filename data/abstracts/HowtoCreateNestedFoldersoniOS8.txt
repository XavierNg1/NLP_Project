Create the folder that will be nested inside another.
Move the apps that you will put in the "outside" folder close to the soon-to-be nested folder.
Create the "outside" folder.
Before the folder forms, quickly pull the previous folder into the newly created folder.
Add more apps to the "outside" folder if you wish.
To remove the apps/folder, simply remove them as if you were removing them from a normal folder.
Notice that when you are on the home screen, the nested folder is hidden.

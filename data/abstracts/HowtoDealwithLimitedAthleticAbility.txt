Keep in mind that, if you make a bad move (swing the wrong way, drop the ball, etc.),
Remember, if you're playing a game with many players (soccer, football, hockey), try to stay where the ball isn't going to be.
Pick one specific skill that you can be good at to add value to your team.
Get to know the coach of your team to get the inside scoop on the best way to blend.
Compensate for your lack of athleticism with qualities such as strength, speed, agility and flexibility.
Learn from others thru observation, coaching, watching games and reading books.
Laugh at your mistakes!,
Ignore someone, if they make fun of you.
Have fun!

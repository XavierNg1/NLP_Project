Determine the type of soil you have and make amendments to get a loamy mix.
Add plenty of organic material to your soil.
Dig and aerate your soil each season.
Ensure that the soil for your roses is dry and friable (easily crumbled) when you begin to make improvements to it.
Check your soil for good drainage by digging a hole a foot deep (30cm) and filling it with water.
Ensure the soil where you plant your roses has a pH of around 6.5, which is slightly acidic.
Consider adding other amendments such as bone meal, blood meal or NPK ( Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium).
Take a shortcut and use a bag of good grade potting soil in which to plant your roses.

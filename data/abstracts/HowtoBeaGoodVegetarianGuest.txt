As soon as possible after receiving the invitation, let your host know that you're a vegetarian and what that means for your diet.
Offer to bring a vegetarian main dish/entr√©e.
If someone asks about your vegetarianism (and they will), politely say that you'll be happy to talk with them one-on-one when the meal is finished.
Say, "I've made the decision that's right for me, but I'm not trying to say what's right or wrong for anyone else".

Place the end of your yarn horizontally across the prongs of a fork.
Wrap the yarn around 90 times, then trim the rest off.Do not wrap the yarn too tightly, or you will bend the fork.
Cut a 12-inch (30.48-centimeter) piece of yarn.
Wrap the short piece of yarn tightly around the wrapped yarn on your fork.
Tie the short piece of yarn into a tight, double knot.
Slide the wrapped yarn off of the fork, then snip through the loops on either side.
Even out the pompom.

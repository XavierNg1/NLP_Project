Obtain a frying pan of correct size for the number of sandwiches you can handle at a time.
Put pan on stove over medium heat until hot.
Butter the pan, or the outside of each slice of bread, whichever you prefer, and put one side of sandwich on pan with cheese on top.
Check to see if bread is brown after no more than a minute and a half, although more time may be needed for desired results.
Know that the second side should brown faster so be prepared to check it in no time.
Served.

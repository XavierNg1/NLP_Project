Liquefy honey in a water bath if you're particular about preserving natural enzymes.
Transfer your honey into a glass jar if necessary.
Fill a large saucepan with water and gently heat it up to about 95°-105ºF (35-40ºC).
Submerge the crystallized honey in the warm water.
Stir the honey periodically to speed up the liquefaction.
Remove honey from the water bath when it has fully liquefied.

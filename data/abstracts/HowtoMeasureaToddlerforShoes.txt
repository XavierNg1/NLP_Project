Have your toddler to stand up for the most accurate feet measurements.
Using a ruler, measure both of your toddler's feet from the heel to the top of their big toe.
Use your thumb to determine if your toddler's big toe is bumping against the end of the inside of the shoe.
Tell your toddler to walk in the shoes away from you and watch the heel.
Select the ideal pair of shoes for your toddler.

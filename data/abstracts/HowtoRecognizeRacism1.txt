Look for stereotyping.Stereotyping is assigning certain qualities to people based solely on their race.
Beware of hostility.Racism often manifests in the workplace as a hostile tone, behavior, or attitude toward workers of a certain race.
Keep an eye out for unfair criticism.If a racial minority in the workplace is told consistently that their work is never good enough, it might be because of their race.
Look for biased hiring practices.If you notice that there are few racial minorities employed in your workplace, the company might have racist hiring practices or management.

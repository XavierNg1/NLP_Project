Think about why you want to create a macro for description.
Open the Layout tab (Page Layout tab in Word 2007) and set your margins.
Click View > Macros > Record Macro.
Click the keyboard icon and assign the macro to F3 (or whatever button you want to assign it to) using the “Press New Shortcut Key” clickable box.
Look for a tape recorder icon next to your mouse.
Click the View tab again.

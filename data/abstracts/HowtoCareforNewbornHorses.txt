Be prepared.
Learn the maximum "healthy" timeline for the foal (if the foal takes much longer than this; contact your vet):


Foal should stand within first hour.
Clean out the foal's nostrils with a soft, clean towel.
Wait for the umbilical cord to break, then soak the umbilicus (navel) in a weak solution of Betadine for a minute or two.
Start handling the foal.
Let the foal nurse as soon as it can stand.
Arrange for your foal to be examined by a vet.
Find a good place for the newborn horse and dam to shelter.
Plan for vaccinations.
Deworm your foal.
Keep interacting with your foal as it grows.
Have fun with your foal.

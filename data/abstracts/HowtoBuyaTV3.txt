Set your budget before you go shopping.
Shop during November or March for the best prices on new TVs.
Remember to save money for the sound system, which most TVs ignore.
Spend your money on size, not fancy buzzwords and features.
Never buy a TV purely based on its performance in a showroom.
Read reviews before making any purchases.

This is Hellfire Peninsula.
Right when you enter Zangarmarsh you will be in Cenarion Refuge.
In Terokkar Forest you will either go to Stonebreaker hold (Horde) or Allerian Stronghold(Alliance).
In Nagrand you will either head to Garadar(Horde) or Telaar (Alliance).
Our next stop on the trip 70 is Shadowmoon valley.
If Needed, you should go to Netherstorm and complete a few kill quests in Area 52.

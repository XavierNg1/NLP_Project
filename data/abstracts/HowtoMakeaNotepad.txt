Plan it out.
Choose your pad color.
Cut out a large circle out of that color of construction paper.
Cut a smaller circle out of the computer paper.
Glue the smaller circle to the bigger circle.
Draw your design on your pad.
Now, take the other computer paper and cut them out to be the same size and shape as the colorful piece of paper.
Next, take about twenty sheets of lined paper and cut them in the same way you cut the computer paper.
Using a hole-puncher, make two holes in the cover, lined circles, and picture paper.
Tie everything together.
On the first page, write down your name, address, school address, school name, phone number, etc.
Congratulations!

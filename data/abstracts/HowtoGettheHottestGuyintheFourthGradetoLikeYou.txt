Dress your best.
Be nice to everyone.
When you're done with your class work, ask the teacher if you could go around the class and help other classmates.
Get to know that hot boy!,
Don't gossip.
Be yourself.
Be friends with his friends, but don't leave your friends.
Take interest in his life.
Throw a smile at him every so often.

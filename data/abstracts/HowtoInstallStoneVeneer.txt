Prepare the surface.
Apply a moisture vapor barrier if you're doing an exterior application.
Create a barrier of 18-gauge metal lath after you've placed your water vapor barrier.
Create a scratch coat with mortar.
Before the scratch coat dries, scrape horizontal grooves into the scratch coat.
Mix the mortar, following the same ratio you used for the scratch coat.
Determine the layout of the stones.
Use a chipping hammer, trowel edge, or other blunt tool, to trim the stones to shape.
Wash the stones until they are completely free of any dirt, sand or other loose particles.
Dry the stones to assure that the surfaces of the stones are damp.If necessary, use a masonry brush to lightly moisten the stone, but do not saturate it.
Backbutter the mortar onto the stone pieces one by one.
Start installing the stones, beginning in the bottom corners.
Continue backbuttering and laying stone until the entire wall is finished.
When finished placing all the stones, fill the joints with a grout bag.
Clean away any excess particles with plain water and a whisk broom.
Apply a sealer, following the manufacturer's instructions.

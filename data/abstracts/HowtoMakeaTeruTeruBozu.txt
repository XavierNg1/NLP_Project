Collect a square or circular piece of white fabric.
Find about a palm full of newspaper, tissues, pillow stuffing or anything light and squishable.
Tie the ball up in the fabric like you would raw cheese in muslin.
Draw a face on the ball.
Hang the doll from a curtain rail or attach it to the ceiling using a pin or blu-tak.
You can leave this hanging for a while, or you can follow the traditional process- if it's sunny, bring it a golden bell, and if it's rainy/cloudy, cut its head off.

First of all figure out where she is on the dance floor, if she is more in the middle, wait until she goes for a break like water or something.
Once you found her little area, stay close to her until a song starts.
Consider the speed


If it's a slow song, look her in the eyes and ask her if she would like to dance (E.g.
If she says yes, you did it!,
After the song if she keeps dancing, go with it, don't walk away!

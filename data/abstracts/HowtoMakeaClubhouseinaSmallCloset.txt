Make sure that your closet is clean so there is enough room to put items in and to move around a little bit.
Get a blanket that you would put on your bed.
Lay it out in your closet.
Now, here's the optional step.
If you made it a bed, well, make it look like one!,
You can decorate your "bed".
Now, if you made it a couch or "hang out", you'll have to fold your knees if you're facing the side walls.
Put small pillows, big pillows, body pillows, any form of pillows on the side or at the top.
Radios, brushes, lotions, air fresheners, anything decorative!,
Last of all, a light.
Make it your own!,
Clean it every so often.
Be creative and use old items to create new, useful items.
For a super Closet Club:


Install Carpeting (if you can) or get some type of leftover flooring.

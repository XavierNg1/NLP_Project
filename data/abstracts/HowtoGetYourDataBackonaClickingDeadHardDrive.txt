Don't go for a data recovery software, it will be of no use.
Be aware that the clicking noise occurs when the System Area cannot be read by the head of the hard drive.
Repair your hard drive first:


For heads and preamplificator: You need to change the head in both case.
If the SA is scratched you might have a chance to get your data back using a "live pcb (printed circuit board) swap".
For firmware issue on your pcb, a pcb swap is the operation you should do.

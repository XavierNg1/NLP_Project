Go to a hardware store and buy a 50 lb (20 kilogram) magnet.
Stop the elevator on the lowest floor.
Spot the keys.
Dangle the magnet.
Lower the magnet until it touches your keys.
Know the key can get stuck.
Tie the string to the telescoping magnet and lower it through crack like a clock hand.
Success!

Organise the supplies needed.
Follow the directions on the dye packaging carefully and make the dye.
Decorate each egg before dyeing if you intend on adding features.
Set the egg on the egg spoon, and lower it into the desired colour.
Place the removed egg onto a work surface that has been covered in newspaper.
Leave the eggs to dry in the egg carton or, better yet, a wire rack which will minimise the marred contact points.

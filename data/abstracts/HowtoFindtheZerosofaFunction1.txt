Set up your equation so that it looks something like x2 + 5x + 4.
Give your equation an "a", "b", and "c" number.
Write down all the factor pairs of your "c" value.
Find the factor pair that, when added together, equals "b".
Put that factor pair into two binomials.
Solve each factor by moving the constant over to the other side of the equation.
Finished.

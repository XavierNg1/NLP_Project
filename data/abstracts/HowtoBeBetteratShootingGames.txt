Always have different weapons for different situations.
If you are playing with a team, figure out what each member's role is (i.e what his or her position is) and then choose your gun.

,
If the enemies are behind cover, use your handy grenade.
If you still die, stay back and provide cover for your team.

,
If one of your guns runs out of bullets, swap it.

,
Its good to protect your teammates as they can cover you during some missions in the game.

,
If there is an enemy vehicle kill the driver or blow it to pieces!

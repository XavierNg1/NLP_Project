Wait for the pit to break open.
Listen to the music and go with the flow.
Two-stepping during fast paced breakdowns is a good idea.
Throw down when the music gets heavier and starts to sound very brutal.
Throw in some spin kicks if there's room, or maybe try something that's unique.
If the song seems to stop abruptly but the band still looks ready to go, then you're in for a breakdown any second.

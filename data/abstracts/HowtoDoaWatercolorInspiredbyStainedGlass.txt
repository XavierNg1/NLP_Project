Gather your supplies from around the house so you can lay out your design.
Assemble your painting materials.
Purchase a new, indelible, standard black magic marker.
Begin your layout on a sheet of 11" X 14" watercolor paper, in pencil.
Choose a central motif such as a bee, a flower, a sail boat, an animal or any other simple image.
Begin to break up the space all around the main figure into triangles, squares, circles and diamonds.
If you want to pay homage to church windows, you could make the top edge of your design into an arch.
Prepare your paints by wetting dry color pads of watercolor with a few drops of clear water or by squeezing out colors from tubes on your palette.
Paint the entire design to your liking.
Let it dry completely when the entire design or all the "panes" of "glass" are painted.

,
Pick up your black marker and draw the lines between each pane of glass using the wide, flat edge of the marker.
Study your piece from a distance when it is dry.
If any section got too dark or opaque, use a piece cut from a white kitchen eraser pad to gently lift or wipe off color.

Cut a piece of wire for your snare.
Create a small loop at the end of the wire.
Twist the end of the wire to hold it in place.
Take the opposite end of the wire and push it through your slip-knot loop.
Pull the end of the wire through your slip-knot loop to make a noose.
Drill a small hole through a stake or wooden post.
Secure the wire to the stake.
Drive the post into the ground.
Angle the noose 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) above the ground.

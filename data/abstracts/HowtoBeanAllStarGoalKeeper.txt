Keep your hips pointed towards the ball at all times.
Rely on the "W".
Shout!,
Stay loose.
Always be positioned a couple feet in front of the goal line.
Always be on the balls of your feet, knees slightly bent and your weight evenly distributed (be balanced).
Always be aware of the everything that is going on on the field.
Watch their feet, not their eyes.
On corner kicks, be ready to rush out and punch the ball out of the air.

Start by opening a new Excel workbook and creating 3 worksheets: Tekeporter Data, Tekeporter Chart (unless you have Chart Wizard) and Tekeporter Saves, Save the workbook into a logical file.
For those who have already completed the article How to Make a Square of Spherical Helixes, it may well be possible to save loads of time by saving a copy of that file anew, and adapting this one's changes into it -- look especially at the value in B5, A5, a small change in the defined Name for N to N_ (and possibly p to p_), a new variable in H1 and H2 called NUM which has no dependent and doesn't do anything yet, as neither do MULTER1 and MULTER2 (left over from a sheet on which they were used to warp output for x and y) ... no, B5 looks to be the only serious change.
Set Preferences: Open Preferences in the Excel menu.
Enter the Defined Variable Names of Row 1 on the Data worksheet.
Enter the Defined Name Variable Values and Formulas in Row 2.
Enter a formula note into cell A3 w/o quotes: "=ROUND((308100*PI())+(190),0)"; enter another formula note into cell B3 w/o quotes: 25822.
Enter the Column Headings into Row 4.
Enter the Column Formulas.
The sides of the square are the last thing to do before creating the chart.
Create the Chart.

Purchase a Mac-compatible external hard disk drive with plenty of storage capacity.
Connect the external drive to your Mac.
Click the Time Machine icon on your Mac’s top menu bar (the icon is circled in the screenshot).
Click the “Select Disk…” button and then click on your new external drive, which should appear in the list.
If the disk you have connected has previously been formatted for use with a Microsoft Windows computer, you may see a message stating that the disk must be erased before it can be used with Time Machine.
Wait for the initial backup to begin.
Close the Time Machine window while the backup takes place if you wish.
Once the backup is complete, the drop-down Time Machine menu will show the time and date of your last backup, as shown in the screenshot.

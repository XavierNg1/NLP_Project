Pay close attention to your surroundings and landmarks and relate this to your location on a map.
Stay calm if you get lost.
Trust your map and compass (if you have them) and do not walk aimlessly.
Start retracing your steps.
Remember that if you are not able to retrace your steps, then the best thing is to just stay put, in one place and let the searchers find you.
Stay put if it is nightfall, if you are injured, or if you are near exhaustion.
Remember that as a last resort, follow a drainage or stream downhill or downstream.

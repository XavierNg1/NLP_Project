Start with good habits.
Use two toys to teach your dog to bring the toy back.
Attach a line to the toy if using two toys doesn’t work.When your dog picks it up, shake the line and run away to encourage him to follow you.
Use treats to get your dog to drop.
Walk away to teach your dog to drop closer to you.
Use “sit” and “stay” to keep your dog from picking the toy up when you reach for it.

Begin by pulling apart three silk flowers with large, full blossoms.
Hold two pipe cleaners together and with one of the large blossoms upside down, thread the blossom onto the pipe cleaner.
Thread two 1" wooden beads from the top onto the two pipe cleaners.
Continue working from the top and add one more 1" wooden bead for the head.
Hold another pipe cleaner horizontally under the head bead and twist twice to secure it to make the arms.
Return to the top and create a hook for hanging the flower lady.
Separate the two legs and thread on tiny flowers for ankle bracelets.
Hang your petal girl where she will be seen as you pass through a room.

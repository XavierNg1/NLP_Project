Free yourself of other distractions.
Gaze out a window or close your eyes.
Let your mind wander in a positive direction.
Dream about the future you want.
Dream about your favorite things.
Roleplay in your dreams.
Dream up something creative.
Daydream during breaks in class or at work.
Daydream in a car, train or bus.
Daydream while you exercise.
Daydream in the morning and at night.

Let your local supermarkets know if they are not carrying the types of vegetarian products that you wish to purchase.
Choose how "strictly vegetarian" you want to be.
Research local farms in your area.
Cook as often as you can at home.
One way to make people more accepting of your dietary choice is to cook foods you enjoy and share them.

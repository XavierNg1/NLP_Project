Start by feeding your baby single bites.Vegetables are often bitter.
Smile and laugh with your baby.Eating should be a fun experience.
Serve vegetables and fruits together.Your baby will likely love his fruits.
Feed your baby larger amounts of vegetables.As you familiarize him with the tastes, move beyond just one bite.
Reward your baby after he eats his vegetables.When he eats all of his vegetables, reward him with praise or even with foods he likes.
Practice using various rewards to learn what motivates your baby.You may find that your rewards are not effective all the time.

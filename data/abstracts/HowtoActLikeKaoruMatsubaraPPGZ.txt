First off, be a tomboy and/or a tough girl.
Chose clothes that are green, yellow, orange, or D, all of the above.
Kaoru's favorite color is green.

Get into sports.
Besides soccer, if sports aren't you're thing, there's always video games.
Learn to skateboard or go on the scooter.
Wear your hair in a short style.

Chances are they'll ask you if you watched something like Naruto, Fear Factor, the X Games, etc.
Wear what you want.
Guys are impressed with girls who don't just watch romantic comedies and like to broaden their movie horizons, so watch classic hits like Pulp Fiction, The Shaw-shank Redemption, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Fight Club, Trainspotting, A Clockwork Orange etc, the more 'cult' they are the better.
Don't be afraid to show your guy friends up.
Kaoru has two really girly friends, Blossom and Bubbles, so feel free to have girly friends, or just friends that are different from you.

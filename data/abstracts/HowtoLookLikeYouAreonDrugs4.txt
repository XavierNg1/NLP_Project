Act like a sleepy, happy baby, talking little and smiling sleepily.
Lurch into wide-eyed happiness right after "taking" the drug, then fade into sleepiness.
Let your words and actions drift off into nothing.
Drift off regularly, either by falling asleep or simply zoning out into oblivion.
Scratch at yourself regularly, as itchiness is often a side-effect of opiates.

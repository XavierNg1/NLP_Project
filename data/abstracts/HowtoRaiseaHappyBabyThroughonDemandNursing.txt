Set up a feeding station.
Try to determine when your baby may be hungry before he or she starts crying and offer the breast at least every two-and-a-half to three hours.
Go to your comfy spot and breastfeed your crying infant.
Relax.
Examine your baby.
Think about what other things your baby might need.
Act when your baby has finished feeding.
Set baby up to be happy.
Do "check-ins".
Repeat.

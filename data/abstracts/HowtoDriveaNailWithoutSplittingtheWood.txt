Blunt the point of the nail with your hammer.
Lubricate your nail.
Avoid nailing very near the edge or end of the board.
Use the smallest diameter nail which will do the job, or hold the workpieces securely.
Pre-drill a hole slightly smaller than the nail's shank diameter.
Use wood with sufficient moisture if possible.
Use softwoods where they are suitable for your purposes, rather than hardwoods.
Avoid nailing through, or very near knots in the lumber.
Back any nail out if a crack begins to appear while driving it.
Finished.

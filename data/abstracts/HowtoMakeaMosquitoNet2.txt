If the mesh sheet or alternative cover is not joined together to make the required measurements, you'll need to do so.
If you haven't already prepared the wood as required under "Things You'll Need", cut it now.
Attach the 55" (1.4 metre) and 75" (1.9 metre) pieces so that they form a frame.
Add the legs.
Lift the frame up and rest it over the bed.
Drape the mesh sheet over the frame.
On each corner leg, nail the sheet in.
Use.

While tuning with the pegs, hold the violin in front of you so that you can see the strings and so that the bottom part of the instrument rests on your legs.
Locate the correct peg that you will be using to tune.
Once you have located the peg that you will be turning, you are ready to tune!,
With one hand, grip the desired peg.
As you turn the peg, pluck the string you are tuning but still keep a firm hold on your violin.
When you would like to stop turning the peg, you should gently push the peg into the instrument to reinforce its position.
When the peg finally sticks in place, pluck the string again and listen carefully.
When you pluck the string and the pitch is just a little out of tune, then you may use a fine tuner to perfect the pitch.

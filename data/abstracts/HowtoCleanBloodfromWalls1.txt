Treat blood stains as soon as possible.Blood stains will set over time and may seep into deeper layers of your wall, making them more difficult to remove.
Remove as much blood as possible before starting any cleaning.
Start with the gentlest materials possible.Use soft clothes or paper towels, not abrasive sponges.
Take special precautions if the blood may contain pathogens.

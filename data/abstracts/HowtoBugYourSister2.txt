Sing an annoying song - constantly.
Imitate everything she says.
Stare at her all the time.
Learn a language she doesn't understand.
Completely ignore her.
Make up an annoying nickname for her.
If you want to get your sister really mad, you should take her diary, where she writes all of her innermost thoughts and secrets.
Poke her.
Laugh at everything she says.
Wear her clothes and pretend you're her.

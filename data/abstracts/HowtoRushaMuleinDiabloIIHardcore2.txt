Do Claw Viper Quest for Arcane wp (waypoint).

,
Go into a public game and just party with a group and hang out and get the Duriel quest; you are counting on them doing the quest.
Get the Staff of Kings, and the amulet.
Get near Summoner, Tp for mule.
Find the right tomb.
Make sure the mule talks to Tyreal first, because if you don't, it will say you can't complete quest.

Choose a stuffed animal.
Measure the length of the animal's back seam.
Select a zipper, fabric for the lining (1 yd or less), flexible fabric glue, curved needles, and upholstery thread.
Select where you want the opening to begin and end on the animals back, this should match with the length of the zipper purchased.
Create the lining for you backpack.
Once glue is dry, remove any pins from neck, arm and leg holes.
Next, stitch the pouch in place using the flaps so that the zipper opens top to bottom along the opening in the back seam.
Now go back and add fabric glue to strap attachments to reinforce stitches.
Allow glue to dry 24 hours.

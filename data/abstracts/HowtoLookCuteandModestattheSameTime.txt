Clean up so you can dress up.
For hanging clothes, either put these two sets of clothes on two different racks, or use some sort of barrier or something that will divide the clothes and be seen easily.
Look at the clothes you can wear to school and determine what you like about them and what you would like even better.
Figure out what the most consistent/important thing about your style is, so you can find appropriate clothes that have that quality.
Get the goods!,
Try em' on, then try em' out.

Select 2 types of veggies (cucumbers and carrots) and a fish (for instance artificial cooked crab).
Place about 2 cups of sushi rice in a rice cooker and then rinse the rice repeatedly until the rice water is not cloudy.
Wash the veggies and place them on a cutting board and cut the carrots in half long wise and then cut them into long skinny strips.
Cut the crab into little strips and make sure they are pretty even in length.

Check on your rice.
Take a bowl and pour in about two tablespoons of rice wine vinegar.
Pour the mixture onto the rice and mix thoroughly by "slicing" the rice.
Place the seaweed layer on a bamboo mat and then spread rice onto the seaweed.
Roll the bamboo into a long roll by first folding the bottom third in then roll it up.
Cut down the middle of the roll, take each half and place them parallel to each other.
Serve and enjoy!

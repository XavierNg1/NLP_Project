Think of the tempo of your song.
Consider what style of music the song should be.
Experiment with similar music.
One thing to keep in mind before you go to the next step, is that although most of the music you've listened to is probably intricately made and thought out by brilliant musical minds (especially if you've listened to bands such as Led Zeppelin or the Rolling Stones), some of the best music is made up of simple segments arranged in the right way (think more of the Ramones or Nirvana).
Start thinking about the music you can put to your own lyrics.
At this stage, you should begin to think about testing the music that you picked.
So now you have your lyrics, and you should now have music, or at least an idea of the music that you want the lyrics to be backed to.
You should have a majority of the song compiled by now, and you must bring it all together.
After stamping out the final minor critiques from other people, you have now successfully converted your song lyrics into a full song.

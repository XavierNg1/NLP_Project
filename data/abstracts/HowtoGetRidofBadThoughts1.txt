Remember that occasional bad thoughts are normal.
Think about what makes the thought “bad.” Why are you upset about this thought?,
Slow down your thoughts with a few deep breaths.
Ask yourself why you’re having negative or bad thoughts.
Remain in the moment.
Put your thoughts in perspective.
Distract yourself with something specific that you know gives you comfort.
Don’t try and run away from your thoughts or “push” them out.
Work on “letting go” of problems.
Literally “throw your problem away.” This may sound odd, but an Ohio State study found that people who write down their bad thoughts and then throw the paper away had a better self-image than people who kept the paper.
Talk through your bad thoughts with someone you trust.

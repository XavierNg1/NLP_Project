Think ahead about what you want, and what you think your boss or teacher wants.
Don't start the conversation immediately with "business," unless you know your boss or teacher is in a rush.
Respect and honor their authority.
Add careful flattery.
Keep your own discussion short and to the point.
Keep the mood light, even in difficult conversations.
Thank them for any help they do offer.

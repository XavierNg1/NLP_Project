Be kind to them.
Project confidence.
Smile and laugh.
Tap into their guilt.
Find strength in numbers.
Wound their pride.
Don’t listen to them.
Show no frustration.
Dismiss them openly.
Walk away.
Take slow, deep breaths.
Think before escalating the situation.
Create some space.
Don’t feel the need to get defensive.

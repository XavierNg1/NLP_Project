On the first round, let the zombies break down the barriers.
Shoot 'em up.
Go out by the PM63 (but don't buy it), and open the next door for 1000.
After about 3 rounds here (so about 5-7) you should have the points to pass up the MP5K in the next room and go straight to the power.
Have one person in the back by the window grab claymores and the M16, and the other needs the M16 and the MP40 from earlier, and they should take the front.

,
The person in back can place claymores against the wall to save them for later, and also provide a few facing the other person as a backup space for when they need some breathing room.
So, you can help the guy in front thin the zombies coming from the dressing room, allow your clay by the window you were guarding go off, then need to use the backup, replace them all, and still have claymores to spare.

,
You can trade off on the door or window, or let the more skilled player take the front while the other handles the window.
Leave out (turn the power on) only when you have at least enough for Jugg and the bowie knife (so around 7000 each.),
Now, use the knife to take care of any crawlers, as it should be around a one hit kill or a shot or two and a one hit kill.
A this point, the accepted strategy is to run the level counterclockwise from the start to the theater, through the middle, and repeat.
Simply open the area to the Alleyway (through the back door of the stage toward the AK74u) and post up by the door in the back.

,
DO NOT OPEN THIS DOOR!,
Sit back by double tap and watch that window.
Using this strategy (and leaving a Stubbs* at the end of a round to hit the box, upgrade, etc.)

The main thing you need to know about Pisces is their personality.
Look her deep in the eyes.
Be confident.
Pisces just ADORE funny people.
Be romantic.
Take good care of her; be a gentleman.
At first she may be shy and quiet but give her time to open up.
If you go on a first date with her, bring her something simple like a necklace.
Ask her plenty of questions about her interests.
Be yourself!,
Compliment her!,
If you feel that you've gotten to know her very well and she likes you, then it's okay to give her a kiss on the first date.

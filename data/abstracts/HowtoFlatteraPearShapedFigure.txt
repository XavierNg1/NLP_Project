Make sure you are a pear shape as they can commonly be confused with the skittle or bell shape.
FINDING THE RIGHT JEANS: Pear shape figures tend to have wide hips and full legs which curve down to the knee.
TOPS/T-SHIRTS: First things first, get a well padded bra, preferably push up - it'll balance between your upper and lower body a bit more if that's what you need.
SKIRTS: Most will work with your shape - but I'd say the best are from just above the knee to mid thigh length.
COATS AND JACKETS: Anything that's belted.
PROM DRESSES AND RELATED STUFF: I'd say the best are the ones that gather underbust, and follow your body shape to the top of your hips and then moves out for a loose bottom.
HAIRSTYLE: I know, it's a weird thing to mention in relation to body shape, but a fuller hairstyle with more volume can help to keep the balance between your lower and upper body.

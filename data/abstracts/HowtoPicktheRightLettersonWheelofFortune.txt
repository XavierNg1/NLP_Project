Make sure you look at the letter board and the category carefully first.
Remember the most common letters in the English language: in order, E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U.

,
Note that the commonly-guessed letter R is less common than often-slighted H and that L appears even further down on the list.

,
If the category is a plural, there's a 90% chance there's at least one S in the puzzle.
In the categories, SONG/ARTIST and TITLE/AUTHOR, most contestants don't normally call the B & Y.
In STAR & ROLE, the S is the no brainier followed by buying the A as the vowel, because you're sure to find the word AS in the puzzle.

In ON THE MAP, if the T is the third letter of a four-letter word, the C & Y could be the next choices before buying the I as your vowel, hoping CITY is in the puzzle.

,
In FOOD & DRINK, call a T first.
If the T is the first letter of a three letter word, there's a 90% chance there will be the H before buying the E, hoping the puzzle has the definite article.

If you thought the T_ would be TO, it's not always the case.
A TITLE or PHRASE that has a two letter word may have the word OF.
For a PROPER NAME, take a look at the first blank word.
The contractions can be interesting if you know what words fit as a contraction.
If you call a N and it's the second last letter of a lengthy word, try calling a G before buying the I as your vowel.
If there's a Q in the puzzle, buy the U as Q is normally followed by a U.

,
If you see any single spaces and you have the money, try buying the A first and if it's not where you thought, buy the I.
If a THING begins with a two-letter word, it's most likely that the word is AN so call the N before buying the A, meaning the next word either starts with a vowel, or a silent H.

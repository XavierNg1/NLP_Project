"Know thyself.",
Now that you understand your own mind better,turn that laser-like understanding on your opponent.
Use three threats in a row.
Take ten moves to do what you could do in two.
Surprise your opponent.
Use fake outs over the board.
Older players tend to rely on their knowledge of positional chess and they play a tough opening and a tough ending.
If you are a very young player, you will not be able to play the ending very well so play gambits where you sacrifice a pawn to get an attack and this usually decides the game long before the ending.

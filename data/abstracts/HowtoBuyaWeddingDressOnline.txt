Look at pictures from the front, back, and side.
Ask questions.
Once you’ve chosen a gown you like, join the auction without going over your budget, or use the “buy now” option if you’re happy with the offered price.

When paying for any big item online, it’s best if you can pay using some kind of safe-trader system.
As soon as the dress arrives, check for any defects and have these sorted out with the seller ASAP.

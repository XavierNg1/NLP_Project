Think and be serious about this.
Dress appropriately and comfortably.
Be nice but don't be a kiss ass.
Being a kiss ass is the no.1 most obvious and dangerous thing to do at a club or being out in general.
If there is a short cut to the front of the bar line, TAKE IT!,
If you can't dance, then don't.
Be weary, club environments are a stage for people to be whoever they want to be.
Flashy stories, clothes and faces can deceive, remember the people at clubs probably aren't even really like what they seem once the night turns into day.

Finally, make the club your stage.

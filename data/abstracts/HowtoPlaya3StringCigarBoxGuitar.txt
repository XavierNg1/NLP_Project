Tune the 3-string Cigar Box Guitar to the Key of D (My Fatherâ€™s Tuning - DAD).
For review: It is Every Good Boy Does Fine on the lines (EGBDF), and FACE on the spaces.
The C Major scale has no sharps or flats.
However, to maintain this same step pattern when starting on the D note, the key of D has two sharps; F# and C#.
The key of G has only one sharp (F#).


Practice a progression in the key of G.
,


G chord 5th fret
,


C Chord 10th fret
,


G chord 5th fret
,


D Chord 12th fret
Though difficult to see, there is a glass slide on the ring finger.
A classic Chord Progression: Place the slide directly above the metal fret at the 12th position, strum or finger pick 1,2,3,4 beats and move the slide to the next position.
The progression is what the left hand would play on a piano.
Experiment to find other three or four chord progressions.Many 3 Chord progressions (1st, 4th, 5th)




,
Many 4 Chord progressions, with "turn-around" (8th, 6th, 4th, 5th).

,
Tablature: There are probably few examples of Cigar Box Guitar tablature, here is one blues scale riff...


This progression came from a guitar booklet called Basic Blues by Will Schmid.

Mount the cameras together physically.
If you've chosen the setscrew method, secure the cameras on a setscrew (grub screw) as follows:


Use a stainless steel setscrew fitting the cameras' tripod sockets to screw them together.
If you've chosen the Z-bar method, make the bar and then mount the cameras to it:


Use a "compact bender" to very carefully bend a steel flat bar into a "Z" form (with a nearly perpendicular vertical) to hold the cameras snugly together (including any accessories and the bar itself between, unless a central opening can accommodate them) and the lenses side-by-side.
Synchronize the shutters.
Give each a moment to prepare at its own pace - methodically half-press then press, don't stab, the button.
Synchronize focus.
Synchronize exposure.
Synchronize zoom.
Synchronize flash.

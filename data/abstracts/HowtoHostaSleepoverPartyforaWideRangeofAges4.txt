It can be tough finding games that will suit all age groups because what a 7 year old would find fun a 12 year old probably won't, but there are ways of modifying games so that everyone has a good time.
Murder in the Dark is a very good classic sleepover game and its bundles of fun.There are many different ways of playing but this way is my favorite.Hide and Seek in the dark is another good game.
If you and your guests like making movies then go for it.Make friendship bracelets.
Build a den.Pillow fights are also great just make sure the pillows don't have any hard zips or anything on them.

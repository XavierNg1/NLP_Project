Mix the graham cracker crumbs with 1 tablespoon of sugar.
Pack the crumbs into the bottom of ½-pint (240-milliliter) mason jars.
Beat the cream cheese for 2 minutes.
Add in the sugar and cornstarch, then beat for 2 more minutes.
Add the vanilla, eggs, and heavy whipping cream, and beat for 2 minutes more.
Fill the jars ¾ of the way with the batter.
Seal the jars, then place them into a 7- to 8-quart (7- to 8-liter) slow cooker.
Fill the slow cooker with warm water.
Cover the crockpot and cook the cheesecakes on HIGH for 1 to 2 hours.
Wait 20 minutes before removing the cheesecakes and allowing them to cool for 1 hour.

Open the Start Menu and go to the "All Programs" menu.
If you don't already know how to use Movie Maker, it should be fairly easy to learn.
Get an image file - any will do fine.
Now go to the "File" menu and select "Save Project", then type in whatever file name you want.
Go into the File menu again and select "Publish Movie", or alternatively hold down the "Ctrl" key on the keyboard and press the "P" key.
Now Movie Maker will ask you what you want the file name to be.
The computer will now ask you to choose the settings for the movie.
Depending on your computer hardware, this can take a while (you were notified that this required patience).
Click and drag the movie file to the formerly empty space in the Movie Maker window where you dragged the audio files you wanted.
Drag the movie file you created into the "Video" track.
Now you repeat steps #4-10 until you have as many audio tracks as desired.
At this point, all your audio tracks should be crammed into a single movie file.

Wash the moss to get as much soil out of the roots as possible.

Break the moss apart.
Add the buttermilk/yogurt, water/beer and sugar.
Pour mixture from the blender to a bucket.
Use a paintbrush to apply the moss-paint to the surface on which you wish your design to grow.

Check your moss graffiti regularly.

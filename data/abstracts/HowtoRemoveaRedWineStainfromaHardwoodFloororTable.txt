Wipe up the red wine spill if it hasn't fully dried, using a wet paper towel or wet absorbent cloth.
If the wine has begun setting in to the wood, the first step is to try to clean the stained area with a strong bleach.
Next, try oil soap.
If the oil soap doesn't work, try a soda paste.
As a last resort, you can try using rottenstone.
If the stain is still there, contact a wood care professional.

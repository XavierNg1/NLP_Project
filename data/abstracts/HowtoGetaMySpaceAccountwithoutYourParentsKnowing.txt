Before you get a secret Myspace account because your parents prohibit you using it, try talking to your parents.
Your parents are probably just trying to keep you safe, if all else fails, follow this guide but always be careful.

,
Make sure you close, or slightly shut, the door of the room you're using.
Don't keep the volume too loud on your speakers.
Download a copy of "Matrix Locker": this is programme similar to a screensaver which shows the "The Matrix" code but you can set a separate password from your user password.

,
Make sure you have fair reflexes.
Don't forget to delete Myspace from your browsing history.

,
Make sure to use a browser with tabbed browsing, so if and when your parents come in, you can switch to another tab, and it will say you are on that site and not Myspace.If your parents know your email address make new one just for your Myspace page (keep it simple)

,
Go to MySpace.com and make a Myspace page.
Now that you've created your profile, get a picture, background, etc.
Ask your friends not to tell your parents that you have a Myspace, but friends can be airheads sometimes, and forget.
When you're talking to friends, try using an abbreviation for Myspace, such as "MS" or "The Space".
Have fun being a Myspace user.

Don't post your photo.

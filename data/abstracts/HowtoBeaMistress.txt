Question your motives very carefully.
Be discreet.
Be prepared to have to work harder than his wife to hold onto him.
Make your time together unforgettable.
Grant him the unconditional love he desires.
Keep some personal time and space.
Manipulating, threatening to disclose the affair and childish games and antics only make you look immature and threatened, and certainly aren't attractive.
Although you are probably insanely jealous of his wife, resist the urge to demean her in front of him.
Imagine how you would feel if someone slept with your husband, the father of your children, and put yourself in their shoes and ask yourself why you are doing something so painful and tearing an innocent family apart...the term home wrecker was invented for a reason.

Look for the love that you want and deserve in a relationship that is HEALTHY and has PROMISE - this one doesn't.Don't break any hearts!,
Be aware that in this day and age of violence, that if the offended wife finds out, your life could be in danger.

Know who you're writing to.
It helps to start with 'Dear ____' and then the holiday or reason you're writing the card.
Always pinpoint the unique good qualities of the receiver.
Be honest.
Correct your spelling.
Use inside jokes, self experiences, etc.
Be sure to have it handwritten, and don't go buy a card.
Give them the card.
Look in your heart and listen, the words come from there, write down the first things that come to your mind.

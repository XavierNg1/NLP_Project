Select the materials for your tail.
Mark a line where you want your loop to be.
Wrap a 5 feet (1.66 meter) piece of 16 - 20 gauge annealed wire around a rod or stick tightly securing one end to the stick and pulling from the other end.
Once the entire wire is neatly wrapped around the stick, slowly pull and stretch the wire evenly spaced to the desired length of the tail.
Decorate your tail with yarn.
Make the belt loop.
Cut a round piece of leather, plastic, cardboard, or wood slightly bigger than the diameter of your tail.
Add a furry look, if desired.

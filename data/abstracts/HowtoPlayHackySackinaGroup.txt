Never self-serve.
Don't apologize when you mess up.

,
Don't "gank" the hacky-sack from other members.
Don't show off excessively.

,
Treat it like any social-group, try to keep up with the rest.

,
Stay focused on the hack so you don't miss a beat.
If you are very advanced in the sport, don't become a "hog".
Take it easy with both compliments and insults.
If the hack lands outside the circle, check to see if you're the closest to it.
Practice!,
If you're new to hacky-sack, pay attention to other members' actions.

,
Have fun and stay relaxed.

Find the common denominator of the fractions you are adding or subtracting.
Add the numerators together and keep the same denominator.
Use the same technique to subtract fractions as you did to add fractions by finding the common denominator first, but instead of adding, subtract the numerator of the second fraction from the numerator of the first.
Reduce the fraction if you can by dividing the numerator and denominator by the same number.
Convert the fraction to a compound fraction if the numerator is larger than the denominator.

Use a quality, professional non-linear editing system.
Think about the "story" you want your video to tell.
Trim the video to be as short as possible without losing quality.
Make all transitions as smooth and barely noticeable as possible.
Remember the rule of thirds, especially when titling.
Balance color, sound, and music to ensure that your video's content shines.
Keep editing in mind next time you go shoot a clip.

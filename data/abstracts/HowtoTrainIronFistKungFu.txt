Start by making or obtaining a bag filled with mung beans.
Place the bag on a hard surface.
Train all manner of closed hand strikes on the bag.
Once you can strike the bag with maximum force, you can replace the mung beans with gravel and repeat the training.

,
Once this is done, you can replace the gravel with iron or steel ball-bearings, and repeat the training again.

,
The training is finally complete once you can perform the closed hand strikes on the bag with full force without injury and with minimum pain to yourself.

Start with a good base.
Use a foundation that is 2-4 shades darker than your natural skin tone.
Brush on a matching powder to set the foundation, or even a matte bronzer if you were really pale to begin with.
Use a black liquid eyeliner on your top lash line and wing it out about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm).
For your eyeshadow on your lid, use a color opposite your eye color.
Do your eyebrows.
Put on dramatic false lashes.
But a clear balm on your lips.
Finished.

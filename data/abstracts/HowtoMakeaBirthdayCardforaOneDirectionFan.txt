Make a suitable blank card.
Find a picture of your friend, and maybe some of his or her friends, too.
Find images of 1D as well.
Cut out the backgrounds from the pictures.
Arrange both your friend's images and the 1D characters in realistic positions so that it looks like they are talking, hugging, etc, with your friend (or friends if you're including friend group images).
Add some more pictures or drawings of things your friend likes.
Add a greetings message inside the card using a special pen.

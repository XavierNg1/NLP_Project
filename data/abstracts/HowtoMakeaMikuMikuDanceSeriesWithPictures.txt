After that, go online and find some music.
Now, open MMD and start making the pictures.
After each pose, go to "File" and then click "Render to picture file(B)", or just press B.
After you made all of the pictures for the episode you are working on, close MMD and open up your editor.
When you add each picture, put a caption on it for the title, episode name, or when people are talking.
After you finish the captions, add some effects.

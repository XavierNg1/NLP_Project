Consider volunteering or getting a job with kids.
Try to give advice enthusiastically when you can to the children you work with or that are in your family/extended family.
If you are looking for a more highly salaried paying job, consider becoming a teacher or child counselor.
Lead an evening, Saturday or Sunday-school class or any small group for children or teens, at a youth club, or at a church, temple or another place of worship.
Make inspirational YouTube videos.
Be a real example: Help them have good, moral fun, being a great inspiration and fun to be around.
Go to where they are and try to influence or do whatever creative thing you can think of:


Music.
Do social networking that is inspirational and spiritual.
Write "serious" but youthful drama that can be helpful to people younger than you.
Mash-up stories (totally change-up, rewrite and combine two or more old stories) -- and possibly redo them as a series of stories; that may become a mini-series.
Teach about tragic, wasted lives... crime, drugs,


Show how "untouchable beauty" is a wasted life, people gawking at unattainable model beauty.
Show inner beauty.
Teach creativity.

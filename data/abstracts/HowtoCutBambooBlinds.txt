Decide if you prefer to hang the blinds via an inside or outside mount, and then measure the width of the window to determine the width of the blinds.
Remove the edge binding from the blinds, if present on your particular model.
Prep, measure and cut the bamboo shades and headrail using a hacksaw.
Confirm that all slats and the headrail are cut at the same length.
Reattach the edge binding.

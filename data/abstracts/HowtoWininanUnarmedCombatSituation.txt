First of all, it is imperative that you assess your situation.
While you are talking to your prospective opponent, walk away from him.
When you get outside, do not let your opponent get near you.
Keep your body language passive, with your hands unclenched and your voice low and calm.
If your opponent advances quickly towards you, a fight is imminent.
THERE ARE NO RULES IN A STREET FIGHT.
In the real world, fights do not look like they do in the movies.
If you are not trained in martial arts or some sort of self-defense system, do not under any circumstances try to replicate what you may have seen on TV or the movies.
Once you have incapacitated your attacker, get away.

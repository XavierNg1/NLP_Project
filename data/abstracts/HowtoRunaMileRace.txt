Get ready mentally.
Take care of yourself.
Have a plan.
Stay hydrated.
Once the race starts, stick to your plan.
In the middle of the race, stick to passing people one at a time.
If there is a little lead on you and the person ahead of you , take some time, run a little faster in the straight areas and where off some time in between you, because the guy in front of you is going to take it easy thinking you'll never catch up.
Regardless of your plan, the last 200 meters should be your fastest, use all the energy you have left and go for it.

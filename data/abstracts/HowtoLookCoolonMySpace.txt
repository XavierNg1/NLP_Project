Change your name to something short and cool.
Get rid of whatever glitzy, flashing Myspace layout you had before.
Delete the lengthy About-Me.
Replace your old 'About-Me' with a short, amusing quote in quotation marks.
In your Interests boxes, pick and choose which ones to bother with.
Get pictures on your page.Get pictures of your friends.Edit them and put bestie or wife etc.
Keep your pictures (as in the ones in My Photos, or any other album, not in the Interests section) to a minimum.
The same goes for albums.
Vary your photos.
Don't add an excess of randoms.Try putting codes to not show comments and/or friends because then it will make you know like you have used Myspace for a while and you know what you are doing and a lot of people try to steal friends from friends so if you hide yours, it will get them wondering and they will KEEP visiting your pageÂ ;)

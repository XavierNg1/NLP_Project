Preheat the oven to 400°F (205°C ).
Mix the dry ingredients together in a large bowl.
Cut the butter into the flour mixture and mix it until it resembles coarse, pea-sized crumbles.
Stir in the pumpkin puree until it turns into dough.
Pat the dough out into a ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick sheet on a lightly floured surface.
Cut the biscuits out using a round, 2-inch (5.08 centimeters) cookie cutter.
Transfer the biscuits to the baking sheet.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.
Serve the biscuits while they are still hot.

Have a really good, honest, guy friend to consult.
Casually ask the guy what he thinks of pretty girls and what's so pretty about them.
Take those tips from that guy, and get one of your GIRL friends to ask him about you.
If the guy says basically the same things about the pretty girls about you, then you have nothing to worry about.
If in the last step, you were known as pretty, then skip this step.
Look at your weight.
Take in your face.
Consider wearing more revealing clothes.
Decide what you want to do with your hair.
Even though your body is a big factor, so is your personality!,
Hanging out with the right people helps as well.

Attend Church regularly.
If you are not already, become Baptized in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Attend either Bible study or catechism classes.
When studying the Old Testament, read up on all the Prophecies which had been fulfilled by Christ.
Read other ancient Christian writings too, such as the writings of the Church Fathers.
Learn both the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed.
Pray daily to our Lord Jesus.
Visit Churches that believe in the Literal Presence of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament, so that you may bathe in His Presence, and adore Him in person.

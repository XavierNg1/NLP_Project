Shuffle 2 decks of playing cards together.
Deal 10 piles of cards out in a horizontal line.
Deal another card, face up, on each of the 10 piles.
Set the rest of the combined decks aside, face down.
Build sequences of cards in descending order by doing the following:


Move any face-up card onto a card with the next-highest value in the deck, regardless of suit.
Turn face-down cards face-up as they become uncovered.
Use the stock when you run out of moves.
Remove King-through-Ace sequences from play as you succeed in creating them.

Get good foot position.
Your front foot should be right on the bolts.
Now put a slight amount of pressure on the tail while lifting your front foot with the board underneath touching it firmly.
Lean your upper torso more so forward than our hips and legs and shift your weight forward when it is needed, as gravity will being pulling you backwards, but also you can shift back if too much weight if shifted.
Then when you are done, or cannot hold the trick any longer just let push back down and roll away like usual.

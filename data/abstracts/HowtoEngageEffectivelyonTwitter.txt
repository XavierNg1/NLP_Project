Remember before you start following other Twitter accounts, it's important to have a criteria to know what to look for in order to deem an account worth your follow.
Create Twitter lists on your target demographics you wish to engage with.Do keyword searches in order to find specific Twitter accounts that relate to your markets; I.E "search the phrase "BOISE" or "FINANCIAL INFORMATION" or "PARENT"

Using the criteria that was mentioned above, follow about 30-50 individual users that fit into your demographics and also add them to the lists you've created.
Look over these users lists and see what lists they are members of and the lists they are subscribed to.
Take the lists that you are following and go through their member lists, take the criteria mentioned earlier, and identify the key users you wish to engage with, and add them to YOUR lists.
Consider that far too many users jump into the Twitter pool with no clear strategy or idea of how they're going to engage users and where they will find them.
Use hashtags.

Know that there is a particular strategy, like all characters, that you need to get used to.
Counter attacking is critical to your success as Doc.
Generally speaking (although this depends on your opponent) you want to pill spam to bait your opponent.
Now for the Counter-Punch.
Once you have done this process 1-2 times your opponent will likely have about 60-80 damage.
Edge Guarding.
Back-Air: short hop and kick your opponent in the face this is probably the best edge-guarding attack you have.

,
Cape: especially against space animals (fox, Falco) this is very helpful against the Up-B recovery technique as it reverses an opponents attack making them face away from the stage thus preventing them from being able to grab the ledge of the stage

,
Neutral-Air: jump out off the stage and hit them with this move to push them further out (very good option if they have used a jump already).
Recovery: you should generally try to recovery low with Doc and Sweet-Spot the edge.
One advanced technique that's very effective with Doc is the WAVEDASH.
Use the Wavedash primarily to get in close for grabs and tilts, and ultimately Doc's Ace: the wavedash to smash attack combo.
Make sure you learn to SHFFL (short-hop, fast fall, L-Cancel) when doing aerial attacks, this takes a lot of practice but is pretty important for Doc.

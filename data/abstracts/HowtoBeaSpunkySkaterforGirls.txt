Work on your hair.
Side bangs are in style right now, but you should go for something a little more over the top.
Do not cut your bangs when they are wet.
Go for a bold hair color or hair color with highlights in the front, on your bangs only.
If you're planning on putting highlights on the front part of your hair use bleach.Here's a hint though: after bleaching your hair, it will most likely become a little frizzy.
When you get out of the shower, don't go to the blow dryer.
So, there you go.
Don't use black eyeliner.
Don't put too much mascara.
Make sure you make eyebrows into the shape you want and then pencil them with the eyeliner you used on your eyes.
Wear stuff that you like and think look awesome on you.
Get Converse shoes.

Accept a hyperbola in standard formula format, i.e.

Find the following elements, which you also memorize the formulas for per the following KEY:

The Center at (h,k)
The Vertices at (h,k±a)
The Foci at (h,k±c) per a^2 + b^2 = c^2
Asymptotes 1 and 2 by the Point-Slope Form, given that slope is y/x (or k/h) and the asymptotes pass through the Center at point (x, y), yet to be determined.

,


Given the equation (y-1)^2/100 + (x+1)^2/64 = 1, analyze the hyperbola it represents into the above elements:

Center (h,k) is at (-1,1)
Vertices depend on a. a = sqrt(100) since a>b, so a=10.

Run through a short checklist of questions to determine what kind of tent you need:


Will you be camping during summer only (in which case a 3-season tent is sufficient) or will you be camping during winter, in which case you need a 4-season or expedition tent?,
Set a maximum budget for yourself and stick to it.
Practice setting the tent up before you buy it--most stores will allow you to do this, or at least have a sample tent set up so you can see what it looks like fully erect.
Bring the backpack you intend to carry your camping tent in to the store with you.
Make a short list of tents that suit your priorities and budget to help guide your camping tent purchase.

Start with a relaxing bath.
As for the dress, you need something that makes you the centre of attention.
Put on something comfortable.
Start with your hair, because a lot of styles involve treating or styling hair when it's damp or wet.
Make sure your face is moisturized, because make up on dry skin hurts and gets all flaky.
Dress up carefully, away from all the makeup supplies and beetroot (Stains are ugly, ask Victoria Beckham!).
Spray on some perfume, toss a few mints in your mouth and walk confidently outside.

Be careful while you're eating or celebrating, make sure you don't spill anything on yourself.
Enjoy yourself.
Wear a smile.

Wrap a string around the bottle several times, then tie it on.
Slide the wrapped string off the top of the bottle.
Soak the string in acetone, which is often used as nail polish.
Slip the string back on the bottle, stopping it roughly where it starts to taper up into the neck.
Light the string on fire over a tub of water, with the bottle held horizontally.
Spin the bottle as it heats up to distribute the heat evenly.
Dunk the bottle in cold water to "cut" right at the hot, flaming string.

Make sure you have a "foamie" and not a "woody".
Know that when you have your board, find a beach that you can is best for skimboarding.
Wait until you have found a good beach, then get out your board and approach the water.
Understand that right after a wave breaks, start running towards the water.
Look to see when a thin film of water is on the sand, throw down the board.
Know that if you have run onto your board successfully, you will be approaching a developing wave.
Have fun!

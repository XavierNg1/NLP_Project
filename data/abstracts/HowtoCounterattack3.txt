For punches, strike his forearm as he is about to hit you, defend the other side of your head with your arm, and then follow through with a punch of your own.
Take whatever he gives you.
If you catch his leg, pull him towards you, and you should be on top.
If you fail to catch his leg several times, go to plan B.
If he attempts a grapple, there is one simple move you can do.

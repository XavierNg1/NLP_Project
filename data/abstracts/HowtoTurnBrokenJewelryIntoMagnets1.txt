Consider jewelry that is large enough to transform into a magnet.
Look for further damage to the jewelry.
Make sure none of the broken jewelry is extremely valuable.
Consider whether the jewelry needs professional cleaning before you create the magnet.
Remove any hooks, pins or chains from the piece.

First, you will have to know how to read bass clef music.
Sit on a spinning stool in front of however many timpani you need to play.
Make sure you have timpani mallets.
To tune a timpani, you will need a pitch pipe, or if there is a vibraphone nearby, it will work just as well because its keys will not go out of tune.
Read the music just as you would any other music, making sure that you are playing the right drums at the right time, depending on where they are located in front of you and where the notes are located on the staff.

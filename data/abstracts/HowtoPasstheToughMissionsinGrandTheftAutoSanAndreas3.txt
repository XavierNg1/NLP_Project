It helps a lot to get the homing rocket launcher before this mission.
Drive ahead of the preacher's limo.
Don't shoot at the bikes.
At the beginning, you can often position yourself to grab one or two packages from the bikes right away.
For regular bike driving, drive on the center line to avoid most of the traffic.
Use the homing rocket launcher for this one.Approach the helipad from the east side to make it easier.
these do not work, you cannot acquire a military helicopter before flight school (all gold even, iirc) and the pilot spawns after you reach the helipad and the heli is already in mid-air as the cutscene ends.
After getting out of the airport, it helps to get out of the car and shoot the motorcycle drivers yourself.
Shoot the planes while they're far away.Get the groups of planes in particular.Once a plane has passed by or dropped its bomb, it may be possible to ignore it entirely after that, so move to the next planes.
Concentrate on accuracy.
To fly the plane, simply hold down the accelerator (although you may want to release it while shooting to give you more time to shoot,) and use small left-stick adjustments to control the plane.
Start with the nearby courier, then the bike one, then the SUV one (usually west,) then check the map.

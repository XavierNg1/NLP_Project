Watch TV and focus on how people's lips move when they talk.
Stare at yourself in the mirror, say the alphabet, talk out song lyrics, recite something.
Ask your friends to help you practice by talking clearly, slowly, and head on.
Consider taking a lipreading class.
Be confident in your skills and push yourself to have conversations.

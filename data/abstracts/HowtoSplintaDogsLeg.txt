Cover any open wounds on your dog’s leg with a sterile gauze swab.
Apply a single layer of padding around your dog’s leg.
Cut off four to six pieces of zinc oxide tape.
Place the splint against the padding to support the injury.
Secure the splint in place with the zinc oxide tape by placing the strips one at each end of the splint and then throughout the splint.

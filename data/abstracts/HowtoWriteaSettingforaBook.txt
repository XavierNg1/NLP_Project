Spend a few minutes daydreaming about the world of your novel.
Once you have a few general ideas about your setting, it's time to start writing your ideas down.
Make your setting vivid.
"Show, don't tell" - it really does work.
Keep it in mind that you shouldn't always show but not tell.
By now, you should have a pretty clear mental picture of the world that your characters live in.
Find a good feedback system that works for you.
Keep going over it until it's perfect.
If you really have a passion for the delicate craft of writing, then there's nothing you can't achieve.

Join a game.
Use the Armorsmith kit.
Throw your bottles of enchanting on the floor.
Once you are prepared, build across with your blocks.
If anyone is around, build a wall around your bridge.
Get over to the middle.
Watch out for enemies!,
Loot mid.
Fight off everyone else with your gear.
When you get your first kill, as long as you didn't egg the person you killed off, they drop their gear.
Once you have fought off every single player, you have won!

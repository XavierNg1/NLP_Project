Choose a microfiber cloth.
Turn off the device before commencing to clean it.
Give the screen a once over by brushing it with the microfiber in small circles.
Only if truly needed, moisten a cotton cloth, even the corner of your cotton shirt, and repeat the small circular motions.
Brush again with the microfiber cloth to finish off.
Wash the microfiber cloth.

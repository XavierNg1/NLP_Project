Get a handle on your emotions.
Communicate with that person on phone and if need be by meeting at a public place whether they purposely intended to ignore you.
If the person confirms to you that s/he ignored you, or repeatedly ignores you for quiet some time, acknowledge that and politely Â confront them face to face and ask them the reason for doing so.
Kindly accept it at that moment and move on.
Forgive.
Focus.
Retrospect.

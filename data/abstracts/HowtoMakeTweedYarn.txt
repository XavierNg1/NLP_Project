Decide on how many pieces of yarn to use.
See if you like how it looks.
Put the selected yarns into a plastic bag.
Use a circular knitting needle.
Turn your knitting and head back until you get to the end of the row.
Notice that you have a tail hanging from the threads.
Continue on to the end of the row.
Continue doing this until you have got all the stitches where you want them to be; you can knit, purl, do any stitch you want.

Keep conversations casual.
Ask her for coffee or lunch.
Break the touch barrier.
Read her body language.
Ask yourself “how much is she telling me?” If she seems overly talkative, you may be able to surmise that she is open, friendly, and that she has a busy schedule because she is single.
Be casual and polite.

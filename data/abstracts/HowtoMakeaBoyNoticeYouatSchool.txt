Make sure you are happy about yourself and your appearance.
Practice walking at home.
When you are in a same class together, try complimenting him such as saying: "Wow, I really like your handwriting" or "I like your shirt.",
If he accidentally knocks something over, try picking it up and handing it to him with a smile.
Don't be too shy around him.
If you're SURE he likes you, but is nervous about asking you out, play hard-to-get.
Be intimate but conservative.
If he doesn't like how you truly are, then it's his problem and he's obviously not the perfect guy for you.

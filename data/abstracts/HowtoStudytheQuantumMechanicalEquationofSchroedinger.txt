Understand the definition of the Schrödinger equation.
Familiarize yourself with the history of the Schrödinger equation.
Study the classical understanding of energy.
Realize the difficulty of solving the Schrödinger equation.
Be alert to the fact that the Schrödinger equation is a non-relativistic description of motion and energetics of electrons.
Note that the Schrödinger equation can be solved exactly for simple systems such as the hydrogen atom and the particle in a box which is a modeling system for the electrons in the atom which are held by a force that restricts their motion.

Inspect the house.
Identify the materials you need before you go to the store.
Watch the weather.
Begin at a practical starting point.
Remove any old caulk from around the window frames.
Prepare the surface of the windows.
Place the tube in the caulk gun.
Cut the tip of the tube.
Press the tip firmly against one corner of the window and apply caulk to the next corner in a continuous bead, just thick enough to fill the gap.
Use an object to smooth over the sealant and remove excess caulk.
Allow the caulk to dry for at least 24 hours.

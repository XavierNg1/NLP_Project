Take a look at yourself and see what changes can be made.
Listen to yourself when you talk.
Be confident.
Always be neat and clean with no bad boy image.
Try to be friends with her.
When you finally know your crush, try to attract her.
After three or four such conversations, or till you feel that you two are pretty close, ask for her phone number, email address, etc.
If you sense some signs that she likes you (ex: she gives you her phone number without you asking) and is more comfortable with you than any of the other guys, you might have succeeded.

,
Try to hold longer conversations with her on the phone.
After doing all this, if the girl notices you, move to the third level.
If she asks you about a coffee, you should not always say yes to her.
If your crush didn't ask you out, gather up all your courage and ask her - at least try your luck instead of staying quiet.
The next and final step, you must be alone with her and say that you want to have an important talk.
If she doesn't feel the same way, it's okay!,
Whether you have won your crush's heart or not, know that you have tried your best and that's what counts.

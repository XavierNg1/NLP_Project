Learn some common greetings.
Remember that after you say hello, you will leave eventually, so learn the next important word.
Have dinner or lunch out, or make a date to meet a special someone, and you may want to learn these words to pay the bill and not be cheated.
Never forget these other words, or you might get into a problem area and not be able to get out.
Always be polite.
If you don't understand, try to say this: Non parlo italiano.

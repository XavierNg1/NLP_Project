Take a blank bulletin board and hang it on an empty wall.
Look around your house for things you would like to have on your bulletin board.
Don't be afraid to hang up some small trinkets, such as key chains.
Arrange your photos and other media.
Consider putting up some personal items that mean a lot to you or that you are proud of.
Make sure that you won't mind other people seeing what you put up on your board.

Take note of the store and what the "item of heaven" is.
Be as good and helping as you can be.
After about a few weeks, explain to your parent(s) about the thing you want.
You could ask your parents something like this: "Mama/daddy, do you have enough money for this?",
Try waiting.
Tell your mum that you would share the item with your siblings or if you are an only child, try to show your parents as much as possible so that they can understand why you want something that costs this much and then they might end up wanting to use it also.

Be good, and don't cause trouble!,
Pretend you don't want it anymore (after a while of doing the other steps) then ask for it...

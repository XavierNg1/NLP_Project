Along with ranks, (3, 4, 5, â€¦ K, A, 2), suits are also important.
2's are the highest card but you cannot use them in a combo, only a double (2, 2), triple (2, 2, 2) or quads (2, 2, 2, 2).The player with a quad of 2's automatically wins (not many play with this rule, especially if you play for money)

Tien Len can only be played with the maximum of 4 players and a minimum of 2.
Understand "rotation".
Tien Len takes skills, practice, and remembering the cards that have been thrown down so you can guess the cards your opponents still have.

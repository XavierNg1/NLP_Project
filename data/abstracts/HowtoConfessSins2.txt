Confide you sins in a priest, or a trusted friend, relative, or authority figure, whenever possible.
Go to your local church and look up confession hours.
Begin with a sign of the cross and a brief prayer from the priest.
Start your confession by asking forgiveness.
Slowly, without fear or shame, recount your sins to the priest.
Make a determined inner effort to move past your sins and avoid them later in life.
Listen to the priest's response and discuss how to move forward.
Carry out your penance as soon as you can.

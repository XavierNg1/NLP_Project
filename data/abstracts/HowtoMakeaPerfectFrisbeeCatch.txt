Don't be afraid of the disk.
Get someone to throw you a Frisbee or aerobie.
Find an open area where nothing can be broken or stuck in trees.
Have the disk thrown in your general direction.

,
Now is the climax!,
When the disk is 1-2.5 feet (0.3-0.7 meters) in front of you, catch it.
If the disk starts to fall early, do not run diagonally at it!,
If it goes too far, jump or run back and jump.
Be happy inside you caught it!

Take some time to learn about who and what the Blue Angels are.
Check the team schedule to see if they will be performing near your home.
Consider visiting the home of the Blue Angels, Pensacola Naval Air Station, during the months of April through December, and you can watch their practice shows from the The Naval Aviation Museum, as well as enjoying the beaches of Florida's Emerald Coast.
Be prepared for the long day of activities on the day of the airshow you choose to visit.
Plan the route to the airshow site beforehand.
Bring appropriate clothing for the weather conditions expected on the day of the show.
Bring lightweight lawn chairs or seat cushions if you are unsure of available on-site seating.
Consider bringing a good camera or video recorder to record the experience.
Don't forget sunscreen, sunglasses, and hats on bright, sunny days.
Protect your hearing during the show.
Be prepared for a slow exodus from the show location.

Preheat the oven to 350ºF (175ºC).
Grease and flour two 9 x 5 inch loaf pans.
Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and spices.
In a large bowl, add the eggs, the canned pumpkin puree, vegetable oil, sugar, and water.
With a hand mixer on low, blend the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients.
Pour batter into baking pans.
After removing the loaves from the oven, let the bread cool for ten minutes.
After bread has cooled, slice 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) slices and serve with fresh, salted butter.
Finished!

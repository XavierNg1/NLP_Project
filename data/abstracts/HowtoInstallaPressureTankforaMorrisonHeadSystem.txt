Use a pressure tank without a diaphragm.
Attach the top of the tank to a tee along the incoming horizontal supply water line.
Next, continue the water supply line by attaching a nipple then an elbow and then continue to the bottom of the tank, through a union.
In the middle of the tank, mount the air volume control.Continue the house plumbing at the other side of the tank at the bottom.There is one remaining hole in the FP7230 which is a 1/4"NPT connection, one may plug it or attach the pressure switch there, such as in this figure.
Leak test and operate the system.

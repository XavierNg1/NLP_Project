Use the beads to help count your prayers or mantras, not as a rigid amount of prayers you must say.
Understand the make-up of a mala.
Perform a prayer for each bead.
Do not skip over the guru bead once you've completed the first set.
Store your mala in a clean, high place, or around you neck and hands.

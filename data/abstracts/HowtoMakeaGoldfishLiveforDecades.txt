Get the largest possible tank.
Set up the tank prior to the purchase of a goldfish.
Provide mental and physical stimulation for the fish.
Add some equipment to increase oxygen diffusion into the water.
Clean the tank at least once every two weeks, but more frequently is preferable due to the large amount of waste goldfish produce.
Allow the water temperature to change as the seasons change.
Feed the goldfish one to two times daily with food specifically designed for goldfish.

Before you enter a room, put on a big, comfortable smile.
Maintain an open mind.
Don't waste your time feeling upset about what people have said to you in the past.
If you want to make friends, don't nag.
Tidy your room/house, and you will feel better and more comfortable.
If you are a child, get you homework out of the way.
Laugh.
Notice that when you see someone laugh, it makes you happy.

SINGLY EVEN ORDER - 6X6 SQUARE.
Now let us have a look at 6x6 squares.
We will now first complete the diagonals by inserting 1 and 36, in one and 2 and 35, in the other.
The completed 6x6 square would be as shown below:


11 16 34 03 21 26
25 22 10 27 15 12
07 08 01 35 32 28
30 29 02 36 05 09
18 13 33 04 24 19
20 23 31 06 14 17

We have 880 squares to choose from, further for placing 3,4,6 & 10 we have 24 choices.

Of course there are other methods of working out the 6x6 squares to give us many more 6x6 squares.
A 10x10 order square will have numbers from 1 to 100 with a total of 505.
We have the choice to place numbers from 1 to 8 as we please.
For the 14x14 square we can follow the same procedure by starting with a 10x10 square in which 196-100 = 96, 96/2= 48, has been added to all numbers to give a total of 985.

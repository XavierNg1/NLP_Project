Understand that to have a successful EC (equestrian center), you will need to start small.
If you don't want to start small, plant turnips and resell them for about 6 months.

,
Buy the basic items to start boarding horses.
Buy droppings until either you hit the limit, or run out of equus.
Go to your meadows and click 'Make Manure from Droppings'.
Go back to the store and click 'Resell Items'.
Continue doing this every time you can.
Hire a groom.
Once you have enough equus, consider buying the following:


a racetrack (you need these for competitions)
a shower (this lets your horses in boarding use 10% less energy in competitions)
a scarecrow (these are great for adding to a large fertile meadow for cultivating crops)

,
If you have a pass, buy a large fertile meadow from the Secret Market and start growing crops on it.
Set the price of board at something reasonable, so people will board there.
Board your highest skilled horses in your EC if possible.

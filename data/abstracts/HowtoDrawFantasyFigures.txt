Figure out what figure you want to draw.
Once you know what figure you want to do, collect references of it.
After finding your references pick your favorite style, or the style you would like to make your own.
Repeat step 3 with a different picture.
Now that you know your figure and have your own style, try drawing your figure without the references.
Practice creating your own pictures and style.

Call a meeting of caregivers.
Use praise and/or tertiary reinforcers to encourage the child.
Develop a BIP (Behavior Intervention Plan) also, especially if the child is likely to engage in SIB (self-injurious behavior) should the reward not be earned.

,
Encourage everyone to be firm about the plan.
Talk to the child and then implement the plan.
When the child earns the reward, they will quickly figure out that using the new behavior is better than using the maladaptive one.
Meet with the implementation team regularly to determine the effectiveness of the plan.
When the plan is working, make the rewarding more intermittent.
Relapse into the target behavior may call for re-implementation of the plan for a short period of time.

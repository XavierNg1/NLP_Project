Find a time when you can take your spa break.
Take a shower.
Start a warm to hot bath.
While it's filling, get an air freshener and spray a few sprays over the bath.
Once your bath is filled, put on a shower cap or pull your hair up into a bun (if you need to).
Last thing for the bath- get some Epsom salt.
Know the benefits of the use of Epsom salt.
Exfoliating face cleanser - To clean your face and exfoliate skin at the same time, mix a half-teaspoon of Epsom salt with your regular cleansing cream.
Dislodge blackheads - Add a teaspoon of Epsom salt and 3 drops iodine into a half cup of boiling water.
Dry yourself off after you are completely done with the soaking process.
Kick back and lounge around for awhile.. Read a book, pop in a movie, play some video games- whatever.
Consider doing some yoga and meditation.
Meditation is also completely FREE!,
Make sure you meditate, there are quite simply too many positives to just ignore it.

Purchase a mold and mildew fighting disinfectant aerosol spray, such as a specialty duct cleaner.
Alternatively, make your own all-natural spray with a vinegar and water.
Turn the car, fan, and the AC all the way off.
Spray your disinfectant into every single vent.
Turn the car on and the AC to max power, full blasting fan.
Find your re-circulation vent and spray into it generously, with the AC still running.
Switch the AC from "max" to full fan mode.
For serious issues, lift the hood, replace the cabin air filter and spray down all the intake lines.
Run the car, doors open, with the AC off and the fans on full for five minutes.
Take the car to your dealer if the smell persists.

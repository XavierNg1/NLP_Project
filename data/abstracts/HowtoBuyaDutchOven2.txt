Decide whether you would like a Dutch oven that is made out of aluminum or cast iron.
Think about the size of the Dutch oven you want to buy.
Inspect the Dutch oven you are buying to make sure that there are not any cracks or fractures.
Find a Dutch oven that has a lip around the edge of the lid because you may need to place coals on top of the Dutch oven when cooking, and a lip will prevent ash from falling into your food.
Examine the bail of the Dutch oven you want to buy and make sure that it consists of thick, heavy wire that will not break when the pot is lifted while full of food.
Check the legs of the Dutch oven.
Consider purchasing a Dutch oven that has been pre-seasoned.

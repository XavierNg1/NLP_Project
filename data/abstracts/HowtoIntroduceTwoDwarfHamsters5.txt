Place the hamsters' habitats side by side.
Place each hamster in the other hamster's habitat or cage.
Use a very large habitat that can house two hamsters.
After about a week, take out the mesh divider out and let them finally see and smell each other.
If they are housed together successfully, continue to be watchful.

Decide what you will be using your alpacas for.
If you plan on breeding, decide whether you want to breed right away or wait until you are a bit more established and comfortable with alpacas.
Make sure you have enough fenced-in land for your alpaca.
Sow the land with hay, grass, etc.
Figure out how your alpaca is going to get water:


A natural source is ideal, but harder to find.
Set up some form of shelter for your alpaca.
Unless you plan on fighting your alpaca every time you need to take it someplace, like the vet, you need to purchase a good halter and know how to properly fit it on your alpaca.
Get a sturdy feeding trough/container.
You will need a farm utility vehicle and/or small to mid-sized, reliable farm tractor with a loader.

,
Get a garden tractor and/or brush hog for mowing around the farm but also in your alpacas' grazing fields.

,
You will need a set of "paca-poop-pick-up" tools, such as rakes, shovels and scoopers, along with a cart or wheelbarrow or two to haul the muck away to the compost heap with.

,
An alpaca First Aid Kit is a must for routine care but also in case of emergencies.
Be ready to spend a little money.

Start at the beginning and spend a little time considering the meditation format.
Find a quiet peaceful place and relax into a meditation posture.
Turn your attention to the mind once you feel more relaxed and note specifically how it is feeling now.
Take your time and let go of any events that cause you distress.
Continue to observe the mental states that arise in the mind.
To develop the mind further, refine and expand the scope of what you are aware of in regards to day to day activities.
Keep practicing this until you can see the interaction parts easily.
To develop the meditation further, keep looking for tension in the mind as a primary target, that way you can get to the heart of the matter.

Empty the bottle you want to make into a glass.
Pour acetone nail polish remover in a bowl that is wider than the glass.
Wrap a piece of string or yarn three to four times around a bottle below the point where it starts to curve.
Slip the wrapped string off the top of the bottle.
Fill your sink with cold water.
Slip the soaked string back on the bottle.
Turn the bottle on its side and hold it from the base over the ice bath.
Submerge the bottle deep into the ice bath.
Wait half an hour for the glass to come to room temperature.
Wash the glasses thoroughly before using.

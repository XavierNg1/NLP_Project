To start your Sunday makeover, you need to get clean.
Wash your hair, and condition it.
Apply a creamy, moisturizing lotion all over your body, especially on your legs.
While your pores are still open from the warm water, you need to pluck or wax your eyebrows.
Apply a soothing facial.
If you're in a robe, get on some comfortable pajamas.
On toenails and/or fingernails, swipe nail polish remover on all of your fingernails and toenails.
Put your hair up loosely.
Perhaps, put a cucumber eye mask or cucumbers/grated potatoes over your eyes.

Prevent escapes before they happen.
Close off all escape routes.
Check the enclosure again.
Examine warm, covered spots.
Look, then look again.
Set up “traps.” Skinks and similar lizards are intelligent and crafty, but you can (at least sometimes) outwit them by setting up some homemade traps — which are really more like tracking devices.If you are confident your runaway is in a single room, close it off, lay some plastic shopping bags out flat on the floor, and wait quietly and patiently outside the door.
Lure it home with a treat.
Wait for it to relax.
Recapture it carefully.
Provide care and prepare for next time.

Take the time to really give it some thought.
Pick a purity ring.
Wear your ring with pride - you've done something beautiful and uplifting.
Finally...you should make your ring an important part of your wedding ceremony; discuss exactly how you will do this with your pastor or priest, it will be wonderful and inspiring to let everyone know what you've achieved and they'll be so proud of you.

Wear proper protection when cutting stone using any type of tool.
Determine which is harder by attempting to produce stone dust with repeated passes of the steel across the same precise line on the stone's surface.
If the stone is thin, and the stone soft, use a change of blades and simply saw through it.
Find a slim, hard steel edge and seat it inside the groove.
Place a single layer of absorbent material, cotton cloth, heavy paper towel, etc, over the groove.

,
Wet it and hammer the steel edge in again.
Periodically open the freezer and pour a small amount of cold water on the groove, insuring it is filled.

,
Once it is well filled with ice, leave it in the freezer overnight to insure the stone is deeply chilled throughout.
Remove from the freezer and repeat the hammering along the steel edge inserted in the groove.
The stone will break.

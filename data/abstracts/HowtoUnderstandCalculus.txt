Know that calculus is the study of how things are changing.
Remember that functions are relationships between two numbers, and are used to map real-world relationships.
Think about the concept of infinity.
Understand the concept of limits.
Review essential math concepts from algebra, trigonometry, and pre-calculus.
Purchase a graphing calculator.
Know that calculus is used to study “instantaneous change.” Knowing why something is changing at an exact moment is the heart of calculus.
Use derivatives to understand how things change instantaneously.
Know that the rate of change is the slope between two points.
Know that you can find the slope of curved lines.
Make your points closer together for a more accurate rate of change.
Use infinitely small lines to find the “instantaneous rate of change,” or the derivative.
Learn how to take a variety of derivatives.
Find derivative equations to predict the rate of change at any point.
Remember real-life examples of derivatives if you are still struggling to understand.
Know that you use calculus to find complex areas and volumes.
Know that integration finds the area underneath a graph.
Know that you have to select an area to integrate.
Remember how to find the area of a rectangle.
Know that integration adds up many small rectangles to find area.
Know how to correctly read and right integrals.
Learn how to find integrals.
Know that integration reverses differentiation, and vice versa.
Know that integration can also find the volume of 3D objects.

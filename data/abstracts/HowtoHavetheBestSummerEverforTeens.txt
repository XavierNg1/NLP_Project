Set a fun romantic goal for yourself!,
Go somewhere new!,
Dress up.
Treat yourself.
Eat stuff.
With friends.
At the beach.
Revert back to childhood.
Do something crazy.
Try some new things.
Do whatever the heck you want (within the law) this is YOUR SUMMER.

,Have a bonfire with friends and throw on some ripped up old homework

Have some type of camera.
Know that you are more likely, than not, to take a photograph, so prepare for it.
Be familiar with your camera's capabilities.
Pay attention to where the light is coming from.
Look at your photographs, if at all possible, before you leave the animal and lose your opportunity.
Pay attention to the background.
If using a dSLR, make sure you have a lens that has a fairly wide aperture.
Take more than one.
Tell a story, or show the animal's personality.
Seriously consider making a video.

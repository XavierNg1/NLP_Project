Wait for a chance during a free period when your crush is crowded around a teacher with other people, randomly walk up to them, but not too close to him/her.
Ask the teacher something random, or engage in a minor conversation with the teacher.
Ask someone else (particularly one of your crush's friends) something random.
Continue to talk to the friend.
Remember, if you want to talk with your crush, and want to be their friend, then don't be shy!,
Continue to find connections between you and your crush.
Get to know their parent's too.
Once you become great friends, your crush may feel comfortable answering personal questions.
If you start dating, let people know!

Realize that the kitchen is often the busiest part of the house.
Go with decorative fluorescent fixtures centered over a workspace.
Use under cabinet lighting to help prevent shadows on the counters, while adding critical light to the workspace.
Illuminate your special home objects, architectural detail, or food presentation areas with track or recessed lighting.
Choose fluorescent lights to provide that missing ambient lighting.

Listen for dripping sounds.
Look for evidence of a leak along the base board of walls near the location of your plumbing fixtures.
Look under vanities and sinks for drips or similar evidence noted in the previous step.
Listen for noises from your commodes/bathrooms, to determine if they are running at unusual intervals, when no one has recently flushed them.
Check your water meter.

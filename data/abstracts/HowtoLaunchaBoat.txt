Prepare the boat.
Make a plan together.
Unplug the trailer towing light assembly.
Put the drain plug in the boat.
Undo the hold down straps.
Have your dock lines and fenders ready to go for immediate use.

,
Back the trailer down the ramp.
Ensure that your tow vehicle has the parking brake set before exiting the vehicle.
Lower the lower unit (for boats with outboard and inboard-outboard engines).

,
Turn on the bilge blower to remove any gasoline fumes that may have accumulated in the bilge.

,
Ensure that no person is near the engine when starting and that no person or boat is in your path before you put the boat in reverse.

,
Pay attention to currents, wind and waves that can easily pull your boat off course and into a collision course with another boat or dock.

,
Crank the engine.
Secure the boat to the dock.
Slowly pull the vehicle out.
When pulling away from the dock, it is important to understand that unlike a car, the stern of the boat is pushed to one side or the other, whereas a car's pivot point is in the front.

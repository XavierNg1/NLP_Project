Gather a group of players.
Choose a deck of cards.
Shuffle the deck thoroughly.
Deal the cards face-down one at a time.Starting with the person to the left of the dealer, each person is given one card at a time, and it needs to be face-down.
Begin play with the player to the left of the dealer.
Continue clockwise around the table, with each person repeating Step 5, until the first round is completed.
Call “Snap” when two cards of the same rank appear face-up.
Take the two piles with matching cards and add them to the bottom of the face-down pile.
Resume play with the person to the left of the last person who flipped over a card.
Create a snap pool if two players call “Snap” simultaneously.
Move a player's face-up pile to the middle of the table for a snap pool if he/she incorrectly calls “Snap!” When a player calls “Snap!” at the wrong time, his/her face-up pile becomes a snap pool.Play is the same as in Step 10.
Reuse the face-up pile of cards when all cards in the face-down pile are gone.
Remove players from the game as they run out of cards.

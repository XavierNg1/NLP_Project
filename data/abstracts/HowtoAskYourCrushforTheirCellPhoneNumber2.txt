Start a conversation with your crush five minutes before your class is about to end.
A minute or so before the bell rings, look at the clock and say, "Oh man, class is almost over!,
If he refuses, just casually shake it off and say, "Oh, okay.
If he says yes and gives it to you, then don't go crazy right there.

Choose the fruit.
Prepare the chosen fruits.
Slice the fruits into slices no thicker than 1cm or 1/2 an inch.
Use foil packets (or "papillotes") for softer fruits to barbecue inside them.
Prepare the sauce mix either from one of the above suggestions or your own.
Clean the barbecue grill plate well.
Place the fruit, fruit kebab or foil packet of fruit directly on the grill plate and grill 3-5 minutes or until tender enough for eating (the foil packet can take 15-20 minutes).
Serve with sauce and serving options and sprinkle with brown sugar as desired to make best use of the caramel flavours.

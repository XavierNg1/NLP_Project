Make sure your rope is securely fastened on one end.
Grab a thin object to form the hitch around.
Create a loop in the middle of the rope by pulling the bottom of the rope upwards.
Keeping the loop together with your other hand, flip the loop up so it is bisected by the rest of the rope line.
Slide the hitch (your wrench, nail, etc) over the first half of the loop.
Slide the hitch behind the center line.
Slide the hitch over the top of the left half of the loop.
Keeping the hitch in place, tug on the bottom of the rope to tighten the knot.

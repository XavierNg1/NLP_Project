Measure, cut, and bend a hook into the end of your wire like normal.
Pinching your pliers right underneath the loop, bend the wire back on itself to make a figure eight.
Pinching underneath the figure eight, create one more loop to make a clover.
Using your measurements, create the zig-zag pattern back and forth with the remaining wire.
Work backward to create another clover on the opposite side.
Bend the cuff around your pen for a perfectly shaped ear cuff.
Measure, cut, and sand down 20 centimeter (7.9 in) or so of wire.
Bend the wire about 2 centimeter (0.8 in) from the end into a loop, with extra length of wire on both sides.
Measure out your cuff width from the bottom of the loop down the long stretch of wire.
Bend the wire back on itself at your measurement point.
Measure out your cuff width and bend it back behind the loop one last time.
Bend the top of the wire back down over the front, creating a second loop.
Wrap some of the remaining wire around the center of the bow to hold it in place.
Bend only the long oval of wire, not the bow, around your pen to create the cuff.
Measure, cut, and sand off 2–3 centimeter (0.79–1.2 in) of wire.
Bend it in half, tightening the two sides so they are as close as possible.
Make two little spiral hooks, pointing towards each other, on the both ends of the wire.
Bend the entire shape over a thin pen.

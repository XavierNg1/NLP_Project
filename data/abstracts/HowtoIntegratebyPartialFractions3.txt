Multiply both sides by (x−3){\displaystyle (x-3)} and plug in x=3{\displaystyle x=3}.
Multiply both sides by (x+2){\displaystyle (x+2)} and plug in x=−2{\displaystyle x=-2}.
Plug the coefficients into the decomposed fractions and integrate.
Consider the integral below.
Multiply both sides by (x+2)3{\displaystyle (x+2)^{3}}.
Differentiate once and plug in x=−2{\displaystyle x=-2} to obtain B{\displaystyle B}.
Differentiate again and plug in x=−2{\displaystyle x=-2} to obtain C{\displaystyle C}.
Plug the coefficients into the decomposed fractions and integrate.

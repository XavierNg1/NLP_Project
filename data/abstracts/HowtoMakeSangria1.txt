Chop up the citrus into 1/4-inch thick wedges and remove any large seeds.
Core and apple and cut into bite-sized slices.
Add the chopped fruit to the bottom of a pitcher with the 2-3 tablespoons of sugar, then muddle for 45 seconds.
Add the splash of brandy and continue to muddle for another 20-30 seconds.
Add in the bottle of red wine, usually a Roja or a Merlot, and stir well.
Consider letting the drink chill for at least 3-4 hours to gain flavor.
Serve over "bubbles," adding a splash of carbonation right before serving.

Count the empty seats and subtract this count from the maximum table size.
Notice which players are sitting out, but at the table.
See the amount of each player's stack.
Compare the hands per hour with the norm, if it is high, some seats recently got filled, adjust the game type to be tighter.
Adjust the players seeing the flop percentage from your observations.
Change your play according to the adjusted players/flop percentage.When playing with good players, expect that they will be going through the checklist so use the adjusted players/flop percentage.
If players entering the game are not observant and believe that the game is loose (as it should be for a smaller game), you should play loose.

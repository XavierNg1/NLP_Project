Remove a 'fillet' from the meat, but do not remove it from the tail.

Remove the rib cage (body).
Cut slices In each fillet.
Cut one vertical slice down the stomach side: To prevent your fish from curling while drying, cut one vertical slit (again not going through the skin but only the meat) down the stomach of the fish and through the cartilage of the mouth.

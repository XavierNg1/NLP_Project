Play in a rectangular pool with two goals on opposite ends.
Divide into two even teams, each with one goalkeeper.
Start the game by racing to the ball in the center of the pool.
Hold, pass, and shoot the ball with only one hand at a time.
Set a 30 second shot clock, like in basketball, to score by.
Wrestle for the ball, but not the player, to win possession without fouling.
Do not go closer than 2 meters (6.6Â ft) from the goal unless you have the ball.
Restart missed shots with a throw from goal or a corner throw depending on who touched it last.
Score a goal when the entire ball passes completely over the goal line.
Restart play after a goal only once both teams are in their own half.
Play four separate 8-minute quarters, switching sides after the first two.

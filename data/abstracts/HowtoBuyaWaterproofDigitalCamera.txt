Establish the purpose of the camera before you start shopping for a non-disposable camera.
Make a list of what you require.
Decide if you would like a digital point-and-shoot camera or a single lens reflex (SLR) camera.
Choose a price limit or range that you are willing to spend.
Do research on popular digital waterproof research in stores and online.
Pick two to three models that you are interested in, and then read reviews.
Look for specials and coupons at local stores.
Search sites like Amazon.com, Costco.com, Overstock.com or Buy.com to find good deals on a camera that comes with other equipment.
Consider the return policy and warranty at the store you have chosen.
Buy your camera with a credit card, if possible.
Finished.

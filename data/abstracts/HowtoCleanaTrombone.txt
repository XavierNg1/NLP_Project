Fill a bathtub with lukewarm water.
Disassemble the trombone into its two main parts, the slide and the bell section.
Place all the parts in the bathtub of lukewarm water and let them soak.
Once the parts have soaked for five to ten minutes, stand the bell section up away from the other parts and gently rub the bell with the cotton rags on the outside and as much as you can on the inside.
Take the outer slide and run the snake back and fourth through inside of it.
Pick up the inner slide and using a clean cotton rag, wipe it firmly but gently up and down the outside.
Use the snake to clean the inside of the tuning slide.
Take the mouthpiece brush and push it back and forth into the shank (the part that fits into the trombone) of the mouthpiece.
Finishing off.

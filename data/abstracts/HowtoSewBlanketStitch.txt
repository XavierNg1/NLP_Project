Keep in mind the need for regular stitching when sewing blanket stitch.
Choose your thread.
Thread your needle and tie a knot at the end of the long thread.
Choose your stitching direction.
Push the needle through the cloth from back to front about half an inch (1 cm) away from the edge.
Bring the thread around the edge of the fabric and back through the same spot as the first stitch.
Push your needle through the loop you just made.
Move a short distance to the right (or left if sewing right to left) and insert the needle at the upper end of the line.
Â  Pull the needle through the loop that has now appeared.
When you reach the corner, poke your needle down diagonally across from the corner.
Pull your thread through the loop as in the normal blanket stitch.
Push the thread through vertically on the next edge.
Poke your needle down as if you are beginning a new stitch but do not finish the stitch.
Leave enough of a loop for the next thread to pull through.
Tie a knot in the thread tight along the fabric.
Thread your needle with your new thread.
Start by poking through your next thread.
Slide your needle under the loose loop you left from the previous thread.
Pull your thread tight and continue stitching as normal.
Repeat this stitch-through-loop until you come to the end of the fabric.

,
Connect your last stitch to your first stitch by sliding your needle sideways underneath your first stitch.
Poke the needle through the top of the first stitch you made and knot it at the back.
Cut off the extra thread.
Add variety if you choose.

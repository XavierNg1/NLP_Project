About a week before the event, help your friend arrange a Wiccan Birthday Altar facing North or East.
Do not dismantle the altar after the event.
Sit with your friend in front of the Birthday Altar while he or she meditates quietly on all the events of life leading to this moment.
Send out special invitation cards to friends and relatives,  Buy cards which have Wiccan symbols outside and blank pages inside.
Ask your friend if he or she is a cake person.
If your friend does not like cakes, the alternative is an at-home sit-down dinner, or a wine and cheese evening.
If it is to be an outdoors get-together, make safe arrangements for a bonfire.
Carry the food in casseroles so it stays hot till eaten.
If any of the invitees ring up to find out what to bring as a birthday present, you could suggest perfumed candles of various colours, Wiccan symbols and books on the subject.
Help your friend pick out a nice birthday outfit and get ready yourself for the big day.

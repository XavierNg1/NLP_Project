Invest in some proper jewelry.
Prepare yourself and your surroundings for the stretch.
Open the sealed jewelry bag and have a lubricant ready to be used with Holey Butt'r, Vitamin E Oil, Jojoba Oil, or Coconut Oil.
Using clean hands, massage your ear lobe to soften up the tissue and encourage some nice blood flow to the area.
If your stretch was successful, and you bought a no-flare plug, then place an o-ring on both the front and back of the plug to keep it in place.
After both plugs are securely in place, soak them with a sterile saline solution on cotton round (something that doesn't have tons of loose fibers).
Clean your piercings daily.
Massage.
Give your lobes a break.
Wait before you consider stretching again.
Never skip sizes.

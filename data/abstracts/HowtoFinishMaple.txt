Sand the project you have made from maple wood using progressively fine sandpaper of 120 to 320 grit.
Choose a type of stain within your skill set as it can be a challenge for the beginner.
Brush on a commercially available sanding sealer to seal in the color before you begin to apply the final finish.
Finish the project with a coat of polyurethane varnish applied by hand with a cloth for a satin look or by brush for a higher gloss look.
Complete the finish by using a "0000" steel wool pad to apply multiple coats of tinted carnauba paste wax.

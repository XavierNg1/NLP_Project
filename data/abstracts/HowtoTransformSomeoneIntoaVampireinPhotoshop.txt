Open a Photo of your subject in Photoshop.
Create a new layer.
Zoom back out.
This part is optional, but helps to make the person more pretty (If they are a female).
This is also optional but you can do this to male and females if their teeth are showing in the photo.
Now, click on the 'Doge' brush.
It's a good idea to make the brush so big you can over the whole of the persons face.Make sure that if your shoulders of arms or any other part of you body is showing, you make that paler too!,
You should now look like a vampire!

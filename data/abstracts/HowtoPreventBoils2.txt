Avoid sharing razors.
Use shaving gel on wet skin.
Keep your razors clean and sharp.
Shave “with the grain.” You may have been taught to shave in the opposite direction that your hair is growing, but that can cause ingrown hairs and lead to boils.
Think twice before shaving your genitals.
Do not shave an inflamed area.

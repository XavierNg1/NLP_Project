Have a location in mind to place the flare before you light it.

Locate the cap at one end of the flare.

Look at the cap.

Remove the cap, exposing the end of the flare.
Hold the flare as far away from your body and face as possible.

Light the flare much the same way as you would light a match.
Carry the lighted flare pointed downward and away from yourself, so that no burning residues can drip back onto your hand.Replace the cap on the back end of the flare (the end that is not burning).

Set the flare on the ground, away from vehicles and flammable materials and be sure that it will not roll.
Make sure that the flare is extinguished before leaving the site.

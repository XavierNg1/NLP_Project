Complete the quest 'Shilo Village' to do this guide.
Now that you have access to Shilo Village, take the cart there, because it's FAR easier than walking through monsters and the jungle.
Go across the bridge near the bank, to northwest of the city/town, and start mining the 'gem rocks.',
Go to the right server.
Get gems while mining regular rocks: This includes from tin and copper to runite rocks.
Wear an Amulet of Glory.
Good luck mining!

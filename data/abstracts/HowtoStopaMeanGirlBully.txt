Ignore her as often as possible.
Tell a trusting adult.
Make eye contact with her.
Use your words, not your fists.
Find her weakness before she finds yours.
Showing her assertive energy can also help, in some cases; it doesn't need to be confrontational.

,
Remember that it's only a phase.
If she feels the need to say "we" or "us" and you know it's only her that's bullying you, it shows that she's a coward, and she is trying to intimidate you.
See if she's bullying anyone else.
Don't let it slide.
Make a confrontation direct and brief.
If they gossip you don't!

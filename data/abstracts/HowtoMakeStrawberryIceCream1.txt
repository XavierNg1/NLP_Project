Rinse, dry, and slice the strawberries.
Combine 2 cups (400 grams) of the strawberries with ⅓ cup (75 grams) of sugar, and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, then leave it the fridge for at least 1 hour.
Cook the milk and ¾ cups (170 grams) of sugar in a saucepan over medium-low heat.
Pour ½ cup (120 milliliters) of the milk mixture into the beaten egg yolks.
Pour the egg mixture back into the milk mixture.
Cook the milk mixture until it thickens, about 5 minutes.
Pour the milk mixture through a strainer into a bowl, then chill it.
Purée the chilled strawberries.
Fold the strawberries into the milk mixture, along with the heavy cream.
Freeze the ice cream.
Dice the remaining ½ cup (100 grams) of strawberries, then fold them into the ice cream.This will give you that nice, chunky texture that store bought strawberry ice cream has!,
Let the ice cream finish freezing, preferably overnight.Once the ice cream comes out of the ice cream maker and you fold in the remaining strawberries, it is technically ready to serve.

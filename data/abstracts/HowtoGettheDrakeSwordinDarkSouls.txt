Prepare for your fight with the Hellkite Wyvern by purchasing the items required from the male undead merchant in Undeadsberg.
Make your way to the large bridge after your fight with the Taurus Demon Boss, later on in Undeadsberg.
Walk onto the bridge and trigger the appearance of the Hellkite Wyvern.
Sprint halfway up the bridge.
Roll down the stairs quickly before the fire kills you.
Enter the door ahead which will lead further under the bridge.
Kill the two Hollows underneath one of the arches under the bridge as you move along the narrow paths.
Look for the Hellkite Wyvern's tail.
Equip the bow and arrows you bought from the merchant in Undeadsberg.
Enter long range aiming mode with your bow.
Aim at the Hellkite Wyvern's tail.
Wait for the Hellkite Wyvern to return to its position on the bridge.
Repeat shooting the tail until you receive the Drake Sword.

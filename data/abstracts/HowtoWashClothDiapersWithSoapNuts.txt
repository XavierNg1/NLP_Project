Scrape solid waste from the diapers and flush it down the toilet.
Run your diapers through a cold wash cycle.
Allow the diapers to go through a cold rinse cycle.
Fill a small cotton drawstring bag with four or five whole soap nuts and draw the bag closed.
Place the bag in the washing machine with the pre-washed, wet cloth diapers.
Alternatively, add 3 tablespoons of soap nut liquid into the wash instead of the bag of whole nuts.
Run the cloth diapers through a cold rinse cycle, but do not remove the soap nuts.
Dry the diapers as usual.
Save your bag of soap nuts after the wash. At minimum, soap nuts can be reused four times without losing effectiveness.

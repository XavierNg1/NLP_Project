Prepare your natural lashes.
Cover the area under your bottom lashes with a white adhesive pad.
Select the length you want to use on the outermost corner of your eye.The extensions come in little bundles of eight or nine individual lashes.
Place the first extension gently onto your natural lash.Close your eye and move it as little as possible as you place the extension.
Apply two to three more long extensions to the outermost edges.Work your way inward as you place each piece.
Place the medium length extensions in between the long ones.To add volume while getting the most natural-looking results, place one medium extension in between each of the long ones.
Begin placing medium extensions to the middle part of your eyelid.Now that the outermost corners of your eyes are completed, repeat the same process for the middle part.
Apply the shortest extensions to the inner eyelid area.After completing the middle section, use the short extensions to get as close to your inner eye as possible.
Allow the extensions to set completely.

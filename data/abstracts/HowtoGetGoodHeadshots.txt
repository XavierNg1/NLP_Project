Make sure you know what you will be wearing beforehand.
Look good, but don't overdo it.
Don't come hungry!,
Once you arrive, try to take in as much of the studio or location as you can.
Be sure to let the photographer know if there is anything about your body that you feel uncomfortable with.
Try to think about something else.
If the photographer is good, he will try to get the best smiles out of you for your headshots.
Don't just do all of your photos smiling, try some different expressions.
When you are getting headshots, make sure you do them for at least one full hour.
Have fun!,
Just let yourself go and be as natural as possible, and your images will turn out great.

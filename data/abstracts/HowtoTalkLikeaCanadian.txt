Practice Canadian diphthong sounds.
Keep the Briticisms.
Say “zed” instead of “zee.” While Americans pronounce the letter “Z” like “zee,” Canadians pronounce it as “zed.” This is due to etymological reasons, since “Z” comes from the original Greek letter “Zeta.”Americans are actually almost the only ones who say “zee.” Canadians, British, Australians, New Zealanders, and most other English-speaking countries pronounce it “zed.”

Listen to some examples of Canadian English.
Use “eh.” One major difference between Canadian English and American English is their use of “eh.” Canadians use this word/sound instead of things like “huh” or “you know.” They also use it to indicate they want someone to repeat or explain something that was just said, instead of other question words like “pardon?” or “excuse me?”For the Canadian pronunciation, “eh” rhymes with “hay.”
A Canadian might say, “The weather is nice, eh?” Whereas an American might say, “The weather is nice, huh?”

Learn the slang for Canadian money.
Practice Canadian greetings.
Use Canadian food words.
Study Canadian-specific words.
Be polite.
Give personal space when talking.
Emphasize the phrase “North American.” Many Canadians are quick to point out that US citizens are being exclusionary when they call themselves “Americans,” as Canada (along with nearly two dozen other countries) is also part of the “Americas.”When discussing what something is like in Canada or the United States, many Canadians will say, “In North America…”
Canadians might also tell someone that they are North American, rather than Canadian.

Recognize the kind of guilt you have and its purpose.
Take stock of what you can control versus what you cannot.In a journal, write out the things that you truly have total control over.
Examine your standards for achievement and helping others.
Focus on quality, not quantity when helping others.
Seek acceptance and compassion through mindfulness.Mindfulness and meditative practices can help you learn to observe your own mental processes, including the tendencies that keep guilt going, like self-blame and excessive self-criticism.Once you learn to observe these processes, you can start being more compassionate toward yourself, recognizing that these thoughts need not be taken seriously or acted upon.It can also be helpful to maintain close contact with loved ones who accept you as you are and display unconditional compassion for you.

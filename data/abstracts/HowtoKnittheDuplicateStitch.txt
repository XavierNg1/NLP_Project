Understand that Duplicate Stitch simply means covering existing stitches with a different coloured yarn to create a picture, monograms, or words.
Follow a chart or you can make your own duplicate stitch using graph paper.
Remember that duplicate stitches can be removed if you want to create a new picture.
Knit your garment.
Thread the needle with the yarn.
Working from right to left, pull the needle through the bottom of the first stitch you wish to cover (and top of the stitch underneath), insert it right to left through both loops of the stitch above and pull gently.
Understand the different processes for making vertical or horizontal stitches.
Attach the loose ends by knitting into the back of a stitch and cut ends.

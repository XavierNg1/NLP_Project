Study the violin.
Tighten the bow by twisting the scroll located just below the frog.
Put your left thumb and four fingers on the neck at the top of the violin.
Hold the bow correctly.
Hold the bow gently but firmly.
Once you have reached the tip of the bow, put your first finger down.
It's your decision if you want to mark the spot or not.
Do the same thing, but this time placing your second finger.
Place your third finger right beside the second finger.
Now move to the next string on the left.
The next string is the D string.
Do you see a pattern in the strings?,
Good luck!

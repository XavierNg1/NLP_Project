Approach the task of making friends with a gay male as you would anyone else.
Don't befriend someone for their sexual orientation.
Meet gay men.
Do NOT treat someone who is gay differently than you would your straight friends.
Don't make assumptions about what a gay man is into just because they are gay.
Don't assume your gay friend will want to do "girl things" with you.
Never forget, a gay friend is NOT a boyfriend.
Don't compare your gay friend to a straight one.

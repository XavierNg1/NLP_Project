Get a funny buddy.
Lose your wits.
Be a "silly spectator.",
Make over the ordinary.
Give your stories a payoff!,
Make it big!,
Rent your favorite classic comedy flicks or a few of the new ones you've been meaning to get around to.
Play Scarlett O'Hara or just ham it up for the day and walk through life with a particular point of view, strong opinion, clever persona, funny accent or problem you must solve.
Let off some silly steam.
Hunt down the funnies.

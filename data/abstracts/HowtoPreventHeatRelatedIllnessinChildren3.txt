Observe your child for symptoms of mild dehydration and heat cramps.
Take immediate action by moving a child inside and giving liquid (if possible)if you notice symptoms of heat exhaustion, severe dehydration or heat stroke.
Call emergency services immediately if you notice severe confusion or hallucinations, lack of sweat (dry skin), vomiting, trouble breathing (or fast breathing that does not slow down in a few minutes), unconsciousness or seizures.

Determine how much height you would like to gain on your stilts.
In the standing position, have someone measure the distance from the bottom of your foot to your elbow.

,
Add the measurements from #1 and #2 together.
Make the stilt poles: Cut the 2”x2” board into two pieces which are each the length determined in #3.
Make the footholds: Cut another 2”x2” piece to a length that exceeds the width of your foot by 1”.
Make the foothold supports: Cut the 2”x4”x4” board into triangles such that two sides of each triangle are 4” long (the hypotenuse is therefore longer than 4”).

,
Nail these triangle footholds into the 2”x2” stilt poles.
Take the footholds and place each perpendicular to the stilt pole on top of the triangle foothold support for each stilt.
If any of the nails are too long, hammer them so that the point faces downward, so as to avoid injury if you fall off the stilts.

,
Sand down any rough spots on the top of the boards or on the hand holds to make the stilts more comfortable to grip.

,
Voila!

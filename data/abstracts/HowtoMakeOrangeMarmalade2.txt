Peel the oranges and lemon completely, saving the peels.
Pull off as much "pith," the white stuff surrounding the orange as possible, saving for later.
Cut the unpeeled oranges into slices on a rimmed baking sheet or dish.
Slice up the rinds into strips or small chunks no wider than 1/2" inch.
Fill a small muslin or cheesecloth bag with the pith and rinds.
Place the bag and 6 cups of water to the pot and let sit overnight.
Wait a day, then cook over medium heat for 1-2 hours or until the peel is soft.
Remove the muslin bag, let it cool, then squeeze any liquid back into the pot.
Lower the heat and add the sugar, stirring in constantly.
Raise the temperature and boil the mixture without stirring for 8-10 minutes.
Test the marmalade by spreading on a cold plate and letting it cool.
Turn the heat off and let it sit for 10 minutes before canning.

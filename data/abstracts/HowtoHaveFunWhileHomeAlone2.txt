Take a relaxing nap.Because no one else is home, you’ll get plenty of peace and quiet, and there will be no chance anyone will disturb your nap.
Start reading a book.
Use your alone time to pamper yourself.Whether it’s an entire night of at-home spa treatments or just a face mask, do something to treat yourself.
Make a delicious snack just for yourself.. Make yourself something healthy like a smoothie or let yourself have a sugary treat like chocolate-covered pretzels.

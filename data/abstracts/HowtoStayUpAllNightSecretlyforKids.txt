Plan it out beforehand.
Don't rush to bed early or your parents will get suspicious.
Once you go to bed, wait until your parents go to sleep before doing anything.
Get out something small like a tablet or phone to occupy yourself until your parents are completely asleep (or if they are light sleepers.),
No matter what, don't fall into a daze!,
Sneak around the house!,
Once it's 3 AM, you will begin to feel very tired.
Once you've stayed up all night successfully, be sure to get plenty of rest the next night!

Get vaccinated.
Wash your hands frequently.When we touch things, we pick up whatever microorganisms got there before our hands did.
Donâ€™t share things that touch your eyes, mouth, or nose.If you want to avoid getting a viral infection, you will have to avoid sharing things that could potentially contain a virus.
Clean areas of your house after you or another family member have been infected.If someone in the household is ill, it is best to isolate them to their own bathroom if possible and, if not, to at least provide them with their own towel so that germs are not passed on to others.

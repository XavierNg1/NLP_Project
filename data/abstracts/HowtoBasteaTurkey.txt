Prepare your turkey for roasting.
Turn on the oven and place the prepared turkey in its large roasting pan.
Set your timer, and let the roasting begin.
After 30 minutes, open the oven to baste.
Take out a spoon, cup, or bulb baster.
Baste your turkey.
Put the lid or tent cover back on, and put the turkey back in to roast.
Repeat this process of checking and basting with your reserved liquid every 30 minutes.
Remove extra liquid if the juices touch the bottom of the turkey.
But keep the juices!,
Make a foil tent.
Spray with apple juice.
Use bacon.
Know that you don't need basting for a brined turkey.

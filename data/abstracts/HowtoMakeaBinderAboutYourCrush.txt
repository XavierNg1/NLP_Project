Get a binder!,
Have a crush!,
Write all about what you think of them (cute, adorable, hot, loving, sensitive, etc).
Get photos.
Write all your connections with them.
Write your name and their last name together.
Write their name and hearts all around it.

,
Add in mementos from time you've spent together.
What does the future hold?,
See all those empty pages?,
Love them!

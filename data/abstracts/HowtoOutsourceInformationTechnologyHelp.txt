Avoid only looking for a permanent employee position for your IT Department.
Avoid scenario when the job is done with current but insufficient staff or talent.
Explore the cost- effective possibilities.
Resist the temptation of doing the work with people that you have but the talents they do notâ€¦It happens that internal teams sometimes are very costly for business to maintain: programmers require high salaries, and a lot of times are very difficult employees to manage!,
Stop worrying about high costs of IT consulting.
Give outsourcing a chance.
Track the things you do on the repetitive basis and the things that require additional expertise and experience your team may not have or could be done better and faster by someone else.
Outline the step by step plan on how you want the project to be done to make it easy for everyone to follow and understand your expectations.
Choose the companies you may want to work with ahead of time and interview them thoroughly, check their references, and start on a small project to try them out.

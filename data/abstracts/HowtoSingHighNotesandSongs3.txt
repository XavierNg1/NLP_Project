Hum a single note in the middle of your vocal range.
Sing a note at the bottom of your natural range with an, "mmm," sound.
Move up the musical scale, alternating the "mmmm" and "aahhhh" with each note.
Move higher up the scale in your falsetto voice until you again hit the top of your range.
Sing your highest comfortable note, extending it as long as possible.

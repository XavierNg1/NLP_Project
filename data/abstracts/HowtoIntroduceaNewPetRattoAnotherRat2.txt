Don't rush things.
Prepare the place in which your rats with meet.
Prepare the rats.
It's time to meet!,
You should have short meetings every day for a while, about a week.
If they seem to be doing well after a week, you can start letting them play together in the place where your first rat usually plays, but if that doesn't go well, go back to neutral territory for a bit.

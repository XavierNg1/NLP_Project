Do aerobic exercise and strength training three times per week.Your dance training shouldn’t be the only exercise you get.
Rest to prevent overtraining.Muscles repair themselves during periods of rest.
Take pains and minor injuries seriously.If you’ve injured yourself, don’t dance through the pain.
Stay hydrated.
Eat a healthy and balanced diet.Dancing is very athletic and requires a lot of energy.

Begin the Tsavo Highway campaign level on Halo 3.
Play your way through the beginning of the level until you reach the first stretch of highway you see in the level.
Jump onto the piping after exiting the highway tunnel, using the machinery next to it to jump off.
Walk along the piping until you reach the second valve on it; the one with the regenerator on it.
Jump over the yellow grating and look immediately to your left after you land.
Bounce off the bolts and onto ledge below.
Leap across the chasm between your ledge and the skull's ledge.
Claim the Tough Luck Skull by pressing the Right Bunker button on your Xbox 360 controller.

Understand what being stalked on Facebook might constitute.
Really just be honest and say that you don't like their posts and give reasons why.
Look to the intent behind the stalker's motives.
Check for possible Facebook stalking signs.
Consider your own perception of the Facebook stalking situation.
Respond.
Try short replies or no replies at all.
Leave less subtle hints.
Ask them to stop again, more firmly this time.
If they won't take the hints or the direct messages, consider blocking them.
Tell your friends.
If you feel genuinely threatened, humiliated, harassed, or you're in fear, as a result of what the other person has been posting on Facebook, seek help quickly.

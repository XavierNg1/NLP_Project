Realize that it isn't about age but maturity.
If you feel that they are reasonably mature, how do they interact with kids?,
Would they be able to deal with emergency situations?,
If you feel that your child is ready, and if they are eager and willing, enroll them in a babysitting course and a CPR/First Aid course.
If you are still unsure, have them become a mother's helper first.

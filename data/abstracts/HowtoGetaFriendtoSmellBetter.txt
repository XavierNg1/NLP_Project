Practice what you will say ahead of time.Telling a friend that that he or she smells bad without hurting feelings can be awkward, and you will need to be very tactful.
Be sensitive.
Understand that body odors are individual and often culturally determined.Each person has a unique smell, which others may find agreeable or disagreeable.
Decide when to talk to your friend.
Talk to your friend in private.This helps make it less embarrassing, and your friend should appreciate that you weren’t trying to call him or her out in front of others.
Address the awkwardness.This will not be an easy conversation to have, and breaking the ice can be the hardest part.
Try offering some praise first.You can make the news a little easier to take by saying something nice to your friend before telling him or her about the odor problem.
Be honest, direct, and kind.Subtle hints like saying “Wow, something smells bad!” around your friend, or leaving deodorant on his or her desk might occasionally work, but more than likely they will be overlooked.Just get to the point and be kind about it, without making jokes or seeming like you’re picking on your friend.
Offer a possible cause.
Tell your friend you know he or she might not be aware of the problem.People are very often unaware of their own smell, whether it is good or bad.
Don’t tell your friend if others have complained.If a person thinks that everyone has noticed the odor and has been talking about it, things can become very awkward.
Offer a solution.
End the discussion on a positive note.

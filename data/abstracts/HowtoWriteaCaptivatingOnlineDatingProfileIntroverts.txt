Choose a Username and Tagline


Your username, unlike your tagline or photo, is something that usually is unchangeable – so pick carefully.
Choose a Photo.
Select a photo with someone significantly less attractive than yourself would create the perfect perceptual contrast of increasing your appeal.
Write Your ‘About Me’


Show people your personality, don’t describe it.
Fill out as many of the basic details as you can, the more specific the information is, the more options people will have of narrowing you down using the search filters: Wants Kids, Aries and so on.
Don't make it too long or too short.
Check your spelling and have someone else check your spelling.
Show why it is that you posses the qualities that you value.
Mention your aspirations and passions throughout your profile.
Avoid negative phrasing, it makes you appear close-minded, cold and superficial.
Consider this: what is it that makes you so worthy of being contacted when there are thousands of other fish in the search results?

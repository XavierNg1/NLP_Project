Do not chose a college by the friend or your boyfriend/girlfriend who will be attending with you or currently attends there.
Seriously consider what subjects you want to study.
You have to like the place.
Do you know what career you want or what your next step is after college?,
Make time for the people in your life.
The only reason you should ever say no to going to that party you really want to go to is if you have an exam the next day.
Driving lessons, dentist and doctor appointments, the gym, part time jobs, hairdressers appointments... all are important.
Think about your day; is there any time in it wasted?,
Don't spread yourself too thinly.
If you don't understand something, ask immediately.
Try to get a copy of the specification for your exam; mark off in one colour the things you have covered in class (and if anything goes uncovered by the time your exam is near, tell your teacher so they can correct the problem) and in another colour the things you feel you can do; so you can plan your revision time to sort out the problems in your knowledge rather than spending time on what you do know.

Before you go to bed every night think about what you learnt in each lesson today.

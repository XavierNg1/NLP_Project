Try making a joke.
Be sure the girl you're after always stares at you.
Ask her out when you really think the girl likes you.

,
Don't be a creepy guy that always stares at her and is constantly teasing her.
Be very respectful.
Don't talk about other girls you find attractive in front of her.
Keep clean!,
Be unique.
Stay on the cute side of weird.
Try little touches and pokes.
Do not be afraid to ask a friend, who is a girl, for help!,
Be yourself.

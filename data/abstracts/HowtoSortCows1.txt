Set up pens and corrals for cattle to be sorted into.
Move cattle into a smaller corral where they can be more easily handled.
Open up the gate to where you need to sort the first group in.
Move to one corner of the working corral, away from the gate.
Step towards the gate opening or backward, depending on the animal.Close the gate when all animals from the main herd is separated into the different corral.
Do a second and third check to see if you actually did get everyone.

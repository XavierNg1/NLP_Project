Choose which lane to enter based on which direction you want to exit.
Never drive next to, or attempt to pass, a large vehicle or truck on a multi-lane roundabout.
Stay in your lane at all times.
Never, ever stop in the middle of a roundabout.
Navigate the roundabout as a cyclist.
Navigate the roundabout as a pedestrian.

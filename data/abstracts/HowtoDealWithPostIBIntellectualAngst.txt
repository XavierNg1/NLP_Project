Realize first that if you completed the IB program, did well on your exams, scored well on college placement exams etc. then you are probably just as intelligent as the people who got into your top choice schools.
You might feel some sort of angst at the educational system or the state of your country of origin, so rather than ignoring these feelings, consider putting your IB training to good use and become a political dissident.
If you're absolutely fed up with where you are now, consider leaving.
Continue learning, including on your own.
Set goals and continue making progress.

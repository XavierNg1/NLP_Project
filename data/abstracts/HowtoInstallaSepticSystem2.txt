Assemble the equipment and tools needed for excavation.
Find where you want to go into the building relative to where you want to place the septic tank.
Excavate a hole large enough to set the concrete aerobic tank below ground.
Place (in most jurisdictions) "inch-and-a-half washed drain rock" from a nearby gravel pit around the pipe.
Cover up the pipe and tank once you have a green tag from the health inspector.

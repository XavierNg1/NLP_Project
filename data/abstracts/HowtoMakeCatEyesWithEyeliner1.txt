Put on some eyeshadow, starting at the lash line and going all the way up to the crease.
Find the right angle for your wing.
Make a dot to indicate the tip of your wing on each eye.
Draw a line connecting the dot to the outer corner of your eye.
Draw another line connecting the dot to the middle of your upper lash line.
Fill in the outline you have made, if necessary.
Clean up any mistakes with a pointed Q-tip.
Draw a thin line along your upper lash line, beginning at the inside corner of your eye, near your tear duct.Try your best to do this in a single, fluid motion, otherwise the line may look jerky and uneven.Again, avoid pulling on your eyelid.
Thicken the line as it gets closer toward the outer corner of your eye.
Finish with mascara.

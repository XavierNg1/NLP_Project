Bring half a gallon of whole milk to a simmer over medium heat.
When the milk is foamy and steamy, add 1/4 of lemon juice and remove from the heat.
Stir in the lemon juice and let the mixture sit, undisturbed, for 10 minutes.
Line a strainer with cheesecloth and place the curdles in, squeezing the excess liquid out.
Gather the paneer curds in the cheese cloth and press into a rough square on a cutting board.
Place a flat plate on your paneer cube and weight it down, pressing it for 20-60 minutes.

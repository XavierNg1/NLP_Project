Now that you have three different page styles -- all with the correct margins -- you can create the page numbering system.
Create footers for the page styles that will have page numbers (appellate brief index style and appellate brief body style).
Go to insert and manual break.
With your cursor in the page you just created, insert another manual break.
There will still be no page numbers in the footers.
The basic structure of your document has been created.

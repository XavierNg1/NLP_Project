Preheat oven to 375° F (190° C).
Separate any pumpkin seeds from the pumpkin flesh.
If you choose to, clean the outer shell of the pumpkin seeds.
Pat seeds dry with a paper towel, if needed, and spread out on a baking dish.
Throw the pumpkin seeds in the oven for 20 minutes, or until golden and crunchy.

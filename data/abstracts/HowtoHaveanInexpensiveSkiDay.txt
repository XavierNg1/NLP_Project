Eating on-snow is really expensive.
Find budget accommodation with access to a kitchen.
Always have a hot hearty breakfast at your accommodation, to fuel you up for the day.
Carpool or use the internet to find if your mountain has any bus service to it.
If you do not have ski/snowboard gear, seek out a local rental place and rent your gear ahead of time, it is much cheaper than renting at the resort.
Arrive early!,
Stop at some sort of quick breakfast food establishment on the way up.
Try to find people who ski/board similarly to your level.
Try cross country skiing.

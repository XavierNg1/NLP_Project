Clean your deep fryer as needed.
Unplug the deep fryer and let cool completely.
Drain the oil.
Take the frying basket out and put it in the sink.
Wipe off remaining oil from the pot and lid.
Wipe the deep fryer's heating element clean if necessary.
Use a soft sponge to scrub with dish soap.
Fill the fryer with hot water.
Run warm water over the frying basket and clean it by wiping back and forth.
Clean or replace dirty filters on the fryer lid.
Return to the cooking pot and give it a final wash. Once the water has been sitting in the fryer pot for 30 minutes, pour half of it into the sink.
Use baking soda if caked-on oil remains.
Rinse the cooking pot.
Let dry completely (blotting with paper towel will speed up drying) before using again.

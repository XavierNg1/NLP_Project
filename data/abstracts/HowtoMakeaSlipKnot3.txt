Pull out about ten inches of yarn from your yarn ball.
Make a 1" loop in the yarn by tucking the end of the yarn under the rest of the yarn.
Flip the loop back down so it lays on top of the rest of the yarn.
Pick up the yarn inside the loop and pull it through.
Pull the end of the yarn to get the knot tight, keeping the loop at the top open.
Slip the knot onto a knitting needle or crochet hook and pull both ends to tighten the knot.

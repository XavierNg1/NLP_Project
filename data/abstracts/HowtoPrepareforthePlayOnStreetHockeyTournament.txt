Choose your team carefully.
Practice a lot.
Book a good hotel.
Fundraise.
Pack the hockey stuff.
Pack appropriate clothing.
Pack the goalie equipment.
Have a sleepover the night before, if you have to travel early.
Rise and shine!,
Hop in the vehicle and go!

,
Play your heart out.
Party at the hotel!

Give your pet a few days just to get used to the cage and their new home.
If you haven't already, buy something to carry your pet in, if it's not trained.

,
Take your pet in the carrier to an empty bathtub with no water in.
Sit cross legged on one side of the bathtub.
Soon they might climb up onto your foot, or up your leg or something.
If nothing happens after a while, place your hand flat on the bathtub.
If they seem comfortable with you (walking and resting near you), but not climbing on you, you can pick them up.
Once they have climbed on you and seem comfortable with you, you can get out.
Give it a few hours, then go back, and put your hand in the cage.
Keep doing it!

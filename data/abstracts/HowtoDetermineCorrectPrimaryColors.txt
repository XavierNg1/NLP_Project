Step one is to define our term.
Get together a good selection of bright colors, and put them in rainbow order.
Draw a circle on a piece of paper.
Try to mix each color using only its two neighboring colors.
Decide which three colors are the "dirtiest" mis-matches.
Assemble these colors, blue, cyan, yellow, red, and magenta.
Try to make red by mixing transparent magenta and transparent yellow, changing the proportions as necessary to get as close as you can to a true red.
Try to make magenta by mixing red and blue.
Try to make blue by mixing magenta and cyan (aka phthalo), changing the proportions as necessary to get as close as you can to a true blue.
Try to make cyan by mixing blue and yellow.
Think about it.
Consider whether the "Split Primary" idea is valid in light of what you have discovered.
Keep a well-rounded palette.
Consider your needs.
Buy several cyans and mix each one with yellow, making various greens; then mix each one with magenta, making blues and purples.
Buy several magentas and mix each one with yellow, making reds and oranges; then mix each one with cyan, making blues and purples.
If buying all that paint sound too expensive, try checking online artist forums.

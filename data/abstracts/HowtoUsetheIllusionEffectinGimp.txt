Find a suitable image and open the picture in GIMP.
After opening the image, click on FILTERS and MAPPING to find and select the ILLUSION map.
More divisions will cause the algorithm to divide the image into more segments creating different looks.
This was my first attempt.
The second illusion is better, but too busy for my taste.
After some experimentation, I finally got one that I like.

First you should know who you are and where you belong, this takes time, don't push yourself into being someone you're not, instead take time to get to know yourself.
Speak openly about your tastes, music, fashion, boys, girls, whatever, don't hide behind other people's views.
Try to find a hobby or interest that you enjoy and are good at, it builds self esteem and gives you stuff to talk about.
Don't ditch friends or desperately try to make new friends, being independent means that you don't cling.
Establish your own doctrine and walk into it.
Try to build your self esteem by pushing your comfort zones, you'll never grow out of shy you if shy you is kept safe in a cupboard.
Learn how to accept critics and how to face them.
Realize that you're a completely valid person and that you've got just as much right to be here as the next.
BE YOURSELF!

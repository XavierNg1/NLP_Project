As with most gymnastics skills, the most important thing for learning a new motion is practice.
You may find it helpful to have a friend act as a spotter, or someone who will help you walk across the beam.
Start by practicing on a line on the ground or a low beam (one that is only a few inches off the ground).
Place one foot in front of the other.
Extend your arms straight out to the side, like the wings on an airplane.
Stay "tight.",
As you become more comfortable with the beam and your muscles learn the movements, practice on higher beams.

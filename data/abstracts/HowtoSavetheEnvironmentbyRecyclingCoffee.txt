Before you start, first of all collect used coffee grouts from your coffee (Tea sachets can also be used, but they might be a little less effective).
Then dry the grouts thoroughly.
Once the grouts are dried, they are now ready to be used.
If you want your hands to be super-clean, Snip the bag open and simply place the grouts into your liquid hand wash.
To give wooden furniture a nice, polished touch, simply dampen the bottom of an uncut bag with only a small amount of lime-water mix.
Before tying the cloth together, place 4-5 sticks of cinnamon on top the coffee grouts.
Keep one or two bags at the base of any snail-laden plant, and some loose grouts planted at the same base.

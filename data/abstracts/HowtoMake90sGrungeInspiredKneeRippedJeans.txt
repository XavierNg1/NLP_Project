Find an old pair of jeans that you're happy to distress.
Decide what shape you want the rip to be.
Turn your pants inside out.
Mark two more, slightly shorter slits a ruler-width (or so) from each of the first slits, moving away from the center of the knee.
Take a knife, or a needle.
Cut with a pair of scissors along the lines.
Slide the cardboard under the cut slits.
Use the tweezers to pull white threads out.
Pull the blue threads out.
Pull the blue threads until you hit the dead end where the cut of the slit ends.

,
Repeat the distressing process on the other slits.

,
Use scissors to cut the middle of the slits, where the white threads are, so it will be separated.

,
To look even grungier, take a razor and scratch the cut the ends of the white threads.
Distress the square edges from the white threads, where the slits get smaller.
Wash and wear!

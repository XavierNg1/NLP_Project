Choose a shoe store with service personnel to help you buy your children's shoes.
Have the salesperson measure your child's feet.
Check to make sure there is about 0.5-to-0.65 inches (1.5 cm-to-2 cm) of space between the longest toe and the end of the shoe.
Push down on the "vamp" (front of the shoe).
Put your finger between the back of the shoe and your child's foot, along the heel.
Flex your child's foot at the ankle from side to side.
Press the outer side of your child's shoe to feel for your child's little toe.
Look at the inside arch of the shoe.

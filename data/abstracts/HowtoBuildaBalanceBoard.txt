Figure out what size board you want.
Purchase a piece of 3/4" plywood big enough to cut down to the size you want the board to be with some extra.
Cut the plywood to size, and the PVC, if needed.

,
Using the excess plywood, cut 2 pieces, each about 2 inches (5.1Â cm) wide and 14 inches (width of board) long.

,
Secure these two pieces at either end of the board, on the same side of the board, for stoppers.
Lay the pipe on the floor and place the board on top of it.
Finished.

Acquire something which has pages.
Examine the layout of the pages.
Open the book.
Place the book on its spine, either in your hand, on a flat surface or other area so that the cover is facing downwards and the open pages upwards.
Grip the edge of the right page (or left if you're reading some foreign texts) with your thumb slipped under the page and index finger on top if you're using your left hand, or your thumb on top and your index finger slipped underneath if you're using your right, grasping it from either side.
Push off the side of the book with your thumb so that the page you are grasping is slightly raised from the other pages.

,
Move your hand, with the page still firmly between your thumb and finger, towards the left side.
Drop the page by releasing the grip your thumb and index finger have on the page.
Repeat the process if you wish; this is usually done when you are actually reading the book in order to continue the story on multiple pages.
Congratulations!

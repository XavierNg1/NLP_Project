You'll probably want some effects.
Make some time; a couple hours should be enough.

The basic theory behind this whole process is to figure out how to make a sound, and then figure out how to manipulate it.
Once you have your noise, figure out how to manipulate it.
Now you have your sound.
In order to keep your audience's attention, you're probably going to need to do some pitch manipulation.
Now you've got a signature sound!,
Go wild with it!

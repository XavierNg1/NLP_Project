Find the first dog.
Go up only one flight, then to your right, there will be a room blocked off with a gate.
Buy the B23R (this isn't essential, but it helps), and hang around the dog for a while.
To carry out the first step, wait until a zombie comes into view of the dog and kill it.
The next dog is in the Infirmary, close to the roof and the room with the part required to build the Acid-Gat.
The final dog is at the docks, under the Juggernog machine and where you can purchase the Thomson and the Sniper Tower.
The Hell's Retriever is found underground, somewhere in the room close the shower room with all the hanging bodies.

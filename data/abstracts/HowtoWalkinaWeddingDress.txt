Select a dress that bustles the train up and out of the way so you can walk safely and elegantly in your wedding gown during your reception.
Opt for comfortable shoes and lower heels if you cannot walk in high heels.
Make sure that the wedding gown you choose fits perfectly with your shoes on.
Consider having your gown hemmed at least 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) above the floor so you can walk comfortably in your bridal dress.
Learn how to walk with a good posture when walking in your bridal gown.
Wear your shoes and underskirt around your home so you get used to them.
Practice holding up the sides of your gown elegantly as you climb stairs.
Allow yourself to relax on the big day.

Talk about your disorder.
Give concrete examples of your symptoms.
Ask for help in finding treatment.
Invite your partner to appointments.
Ask for support in following treatment.
Let your partner know how she can support you at home.
Say something if you have suicidal thoughts.
Ask him to call 911.
Don’t let your partner leave you alone.

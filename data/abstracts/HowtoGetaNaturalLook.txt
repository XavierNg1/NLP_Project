Ditch the heavy makeup.
Wear basic clothes.
Wear accessories.
Be confident in yourself.
Do not over-style your hair.
Look "in season".
Pay attention to your grooming in general.
Avoid the glittery, or overly bright nail polishes that are so popular.
Do not attempt to hide skin flaws with obvious layers of makeup unless they are very noticeable or serious.
Trim and shape your eyebrows.
Have a knowledgeable person help you select colors and shades of clothing, accessories, and makeup that "fit" you properly.

Position yourself in a double "gedan burai" (front stance.),
Begin by bringing your back knee up and forward.
Once your leg is up in the air, it's time for the kick.
Snap the leg forward at your target, while rolling your hips forward.
Pull the leg and hip back to the position in Step 2.
Drop your leg back down to your original gedan barai position.
Repeat 10 times, then switch legs.

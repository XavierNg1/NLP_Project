If it is possible, put your profile on public.
Have lots of buddies (that you know or have friends that know, of course) that would visit your profile, say, to look at your photos or comment it.
Make them want to come back.
If none of these have worked well, and you're getting desperate, go to the "people you may know" section of your buddies tab and search for screen names.
If this method doesn't get you more visitors, then you're getting REALLY desperate but there is a way to solve it, however it requires a little free time.

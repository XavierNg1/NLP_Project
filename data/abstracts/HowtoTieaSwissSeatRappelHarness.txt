Find the center of the rope by folding it in half and going to the fold.
Cross the halves in front of you so that it wraps around your waist.
Reach around the outside of your legs with both hands and pull the free ends behind you through your legs.
Pull down on these as you squat.
For both sides, maintaining tension on the free end, drop it behind your back and pass it behind the length of rope that cups your bum, from back to front.
Connect the two ends together using a square knot off-centre to your body.
Make a half hitch with each free end as a keeper knot.
Place any excess rope out of the way in a deep left pocket (cargo pants are an asset) if you have one, and if your knot is on the left.
Your harness is done.

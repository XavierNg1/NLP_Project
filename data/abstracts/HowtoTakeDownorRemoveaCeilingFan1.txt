Assess whether you have a ball-in-socket style ceiling fan, also known as a down-rod mounted ceiling fan.
Always turn off the power at the electrical panel before working on anything electrical.
Place your ladder under the ceiling fan.
Remove the metal canopy that covers the mounting bracket by loosening the screws on either side.
Retest that you have no power coming to the fan.
Remove the wire nuts that are connecting the wires from the fan and the wires from the ceiling together.
Grab a hold of the whole light fixture and slide the ball at the top of the fan pole out of the mounting bracket.
Lower the fan to the ground.
Detach the mounting bracket from the ceiling.

Learn your lines.
Learn your song.
Practice any dancing.
Decide how you want to affect the person you are talking to (or singing to) with your lines.
Always make a strong choice about your character.
Next is blocking.
Drink a lot of fluids and (most importantly) have fun!,
On the night of the performance everyone is always nervous - it's a sign of sanity!,
It is best to get into character at least 10 minutes before the first scene, even if you aren't in it.

To begin you have to cut the flowers, morning is usually the best time, after all the dew has dried.
Air drying is one of the easiest ways to dry flowers and many flowers can be dried this way roses, babyâ€™s breath and hydrangeas to name a few.
Another way to dry flowers is by the use of silica sand.
Start by spreading a layer of sand in deep tray.
The next step is to slowly spoon the sand over the flowers making sure you get the sand into every petal and part of the flowers.
Once the flowers are dry gently brush the sand off.
Finished.

Get out there.

Turn the main dial to PROGRAM.
Look for things to photograph.
Look through your viewfinder and focus on whatever you want in focus.
Gently half-press the shutter button.
Check the green P. This actually conveys some useful information:

A solid, non-blinking P: green means go!The camera is happy and ready to shoot.

Press the shutter button all the way down to shoot.

Keep moving and shooting until you hit the end of the roll.

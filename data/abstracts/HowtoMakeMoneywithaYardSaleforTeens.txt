Start by asking your parents for permission to have a yard sale in your front yard, or on the driveway so you don't mess up the grass.
Clean out your room about 2 weeks prior to the sale.
Ask your family to find things they no longer want.
Decide a date and a time for the sale.
Make about ten posters saying when and where your sale is going to be.
Mark everything you have to sell with the selling price, but not too high.

,
Get some change a few days before the sale so that you have it on hand for the day of your sale.
Make sure your items look presentable.
Check all CDs and video games.
Set up your tables and sort the clothes, CDs and books and whatever else you have to sell.
Increase the number of sales you make to each customer.
Keep your pets away from the yard sale.
Wait for your patrons to start arriving and give them your full attention.
Be friendly.
Accept cash only.

Pick someone who will not be playing.
Pick a murderer.
Begin the game.
Scratch the inside of other players’ wrists.
Wait ten seconds before “dying.” As a player, if the inside of your wrist is scratched, you must wait ten seconds before you officially “die.” This helps add to the mystery of who the killer is, as you will likely have shaken someone else’s hand right after the murderer’s.
Try to guess who the murderer is.

Admit that you are addicted.
If the computer is in your bedroom, take it out!,
Plan how many hours a day that you may use the computer.
After 10 days, cut back another hour and wait 10 days.

,Continue until you are at a normal amount of time per day (anywhere from 1-3 hours)

,
While you are "not allowed" on the computer, find something to do.
Once you are at the normal amount, set rules for the computer for everyone.

Do not wear your band uniform.
Get your stuff together, and have extras of everything on hand - extra reeds (in a reed holder that you can put in your pocket) if you play a woodwind instrument, whatever else you might need, and a couple spare copies of the prepared piece, if it makes you feel better to have them on hand.

Check your instrument to make sure it's in good working order (though you should have had it professionally looked at already).
Show up at the audition site at least half an hour early, so that you'll have plenty of time to warm up, and you'll be there if the auditions are running ahead of schedule.
Once you've warmed up, get to your room at least 15 minutes early.
Stay calm.

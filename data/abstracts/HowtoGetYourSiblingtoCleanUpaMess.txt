Don't yell at your siblings especially if they are young.
Don't hit your siblings.
Make sure there are NO distractions.
Make it fun!,
Approach them quietly.
Make sure your siblings see cleaning as an opportunity, not a chore.
If your siblings are still getting distracted by TV, drawing or other things, trick them into cleaning.
Make cleaning up a game.
Put on a catchy song they like and tell them you bet they can't clean up before the song finishes.
Remember, one reason that rooms are messy is because kids leave it for too long, and mess builds up.
Praise the sibling for cleaning up.
Move away from bribes ( DO NOT BRIBE, BAD OUTCOME) You should teach your sister to do it from her own free will.
Just remember to support your sibling because they ARE doing something GOOD.

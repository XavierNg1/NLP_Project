Look to your friends and family members for reference to any type of camp.
Be specific on what type of camp you are looking for.
Most camps are priced around how long you want to stay, which is also something you may want to know BEFORE selecting just any camp.
Make sure you have the right money for a camp.
Avoid bringing ELECTRONIC ITEMS.
Bring as many pieces of lined paper as you can, and a pencil and pencil sharpener, in case you want to write letters to your family back home to express your feelings about camp.
Make sure you have responsibility.
Make sure you know who the counselors are.
The camp is filled with many other kids and teens and not EVERYONE will adore you.
Prepare to meet new people and make new friends.
Get to know the director of the camp.

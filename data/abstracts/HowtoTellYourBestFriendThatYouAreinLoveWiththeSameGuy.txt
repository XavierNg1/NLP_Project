Consider what it is about the guy that makes you think you're also falling for him.
Consider your friendship.
If you've decided this guy is worth the struggle, discuss your feelings with your friend.
Explain that you fancy the same fellow that she does but that you realize that your friendship comes first.
Explain why this guy matters to you without laying it on thick.
Finish up by saying that you don't want to fight about him.
Give her plenty of time and space to talk.
Try to keep the friendship at the heart of the solution.
If she starts dating him, or before, make a pact that boyfriends won't get in the way of you two being close friends.

,
If she does let you have, him wait!,
Leave this guy alone.
Get over him.
Bear in mind that no matter how new, how odd or how serious the relationship is, it isn't your place to be the wedge in it.

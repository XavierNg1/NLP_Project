Locate a local butcher or meat market in your area that cuts standing rib roast to order.
Determine how many ribs you will need to feed your diners.
Ask specifically for prime-grade meat.
Request the butcher precut the roast for you by slicing off the "chine bones," which are located at the bottom of the roast.
Ask the butcher to trim the bones if they are longer than 7 to 8 inches (17.8 to 20.3 cm).
Inspect the roast once the butcher has cut it for you.

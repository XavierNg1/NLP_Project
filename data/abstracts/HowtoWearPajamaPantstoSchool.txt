Think of something school appropriate because some schools may see PJs as too casual.
Pair them with just about anything; it's better to tone down the top when wearing PJ's, especially if they haven't become a trend in your school yet.
Make sure you look good.
Don't over-do it.
Make sure you are confined in them so you don't have embarrassing incidents.

Decide whether you want to use an orbital buffer or hand-polish using a soft cloth.
Wash your car thoroughly.
Apply the polish to a soft cloth or the pad of your orbital buffer, and rub it in a circular motion on the car.
Continue to rub or buff the area in a circular motion until the polish disappears completely.
Finished.

Enter a match on the level Rooftops in Versus mode.
Wait until you spawn on the dark side of the map.
Move through the level until you are directly behind your side's Hammer of Dawn bunker.
Look for three windows directly in front of you.
Either pick up the Hammer of Dawn or select your Smoke Grenade from your inventory.
Throw your Smoke Grenade into the left, broken window, angled towards the middle window.
View the Toilet Easter Egg while either the smoke or beam from the Hammer of Dawn light the room inside up.

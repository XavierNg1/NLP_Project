Understand why girls act differently.
Recognize that girls are socialized to hide feelings too, just in different ways than boys are.
Remember that every woman is different.
If she wants you to leave her alone, she may stay farther away from you than normal and not talk as much.
If she is sad, she might try to act like things are fine, making this a little harder to figure out.
If she is mad at you, she will act like you don't care about her.
She may become quiet if you say something that upsets her.
If a girl likes you, she will most likely act either really flirty, play with her hair or stare at you when you are around her or talking to her.
If she looks at you and smiles when it is silent, and plays with her hair and bites her lip she might be hinting for you to kiss her.
If she might be cheating on you, she might act defensive and will be gone more than usual, or just not hang out with you a lot.

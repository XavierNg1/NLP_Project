Decide what type baler you want.
Hook the baler up to your tractor.
Install the string or net wrap in the appropriate compartment.
Perform maintenance checks before beginning to bale.
Drop the pick-up wheels from each side of the baler and make sure that they are barely touching the ground.
Turn your PTO on with the throttle all the way back (at idle or turtle).
Drive forward, keeping your speed down between 20 or 40 km/h (12 or 25 mph).
Bale away.
Let the baler get full enough.
Put the strings on.
Empty bale from the baler.
Test the bale for moisture.
Rev up the engine, turn the belts back on again and continue baling your second bale.

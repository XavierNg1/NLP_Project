Place the apples in the fridge.
Cover a large baking sheet with wax paper.
Assemble a double-boiler.
Place the chocolate and the butter into the bowl.
Melt the chocolate and butter over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula.
Remove the bowl from the saucepan and set it down onto a stable work surface.
Dip the first apple into the melted chocolate.
Consider dipping the apple in chopped nuts.
Set the apple down onto the baking sheet and move onto the next.
Place the baking sheet into the fridge for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the chocolate hardens.Because you added some butter to the chocolate, it will never become rock-solid.

Hang a row of cheerleading tassels.
Use tissue paper to make the tassels.
Lay out a sheet of tissue paper.
Cut along one of the folds you've just made.
Using a ruler, mark a series of 1/2 inch (1.2cm) dividing lines all the way across the sheet.
Cut along each break mark to form the tassel lengths.
Unfold the sheets you've just cut.
From one side of the first cut sheet, begin rolling the middle, uncut section in a sausage shape.
When you reach the middle of the roll, twist the roll as much as you can.
Wrap something around the folded end to complete the look.
Repeat with the other piece of cut tissue paper.
When all of the tassels are completed, thread them along a cord, string, wire, etc.
Find a good place to hang the garland.

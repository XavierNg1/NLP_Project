Carry business cards with you.
Be grounded in your profession as a Reiki-therapist.
Healing and Reiki go hand-in-hand, but be wary of calling yourself a ‘Reiki healer’.
Be clear about just exactly what skills you possess.
If a person asks you about what Reiki is, be brief with room to elaborate if the interest is there.
Read up on other forms of energy work such as healing touch or shiatsu to have a comparison for dialogue if your listener is not familiar with the concept of ‘energy work’.
If you are a Reiki master, always offer to train your listener in a beginning class, such as Reiki 1.
Finally, be prepared to be surprised.

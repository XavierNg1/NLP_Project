Get some 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) wooden blocks.
Paint the blocks with acrylic, if desired.
Find 5 to 6 photos.
Crop the photos down.
Coat one side of the block with a decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge.
Press the photo into the glue.
Apply another layer of decoupage glue over the photo.
Continue applying the rest of the photos.
Let the glue dry.

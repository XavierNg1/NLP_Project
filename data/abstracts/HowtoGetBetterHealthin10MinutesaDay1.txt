Exercise on purpose.
Read how this works as explained by Dr. Tim Church, Pennington Research Center, Baton Rouge, La.
Realize the regular recommendation is to gradually work up to 150 minutes a week (21+ minutes per day) of exercise — and this did not change, yet recent studies indicate that results are apparent in half that time.
Avoid perfectionism, ie: all-or-nothing thinking:


like "I can’t run fast for 4 minutes, or jog for an hour, so why even try?",
Reshape your thinking and shape-up your health: as Dr. Church suggests that your walking a few minutes a day: “... will reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, anxiety, depression, diabetes, and many other conditions.”

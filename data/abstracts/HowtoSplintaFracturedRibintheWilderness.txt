Try settling down for a short time to see if the pain subsides a little.
Expect to hurt worse in a day or two when the muscles become swollen and very sore.

,
Get moving quickly, because you have to deal with it before you are extremely sore.
Consider how the ribs are encased in muscles and connective tissues which may be extremely sore for weeks, and take several months to become comfortable and complete recovery to normal.

Seek life-support immediately for the chest injury called flail chest: this occurs when two, three or more adjoining ribs are broken in two or more places.
Expect simple, limited rib cracking and breaking to heal without any special wraps, but ask medical authorities.
Wear a "rib belt" (if prescribed).
Do "not" attempt to use a tourniquet on the ribs, chest, neck, head or torso -- there is no way.
Once you get to civilization, rest and recuperation are the main treatment for sore, cracked or not too badly broken ribs.

Find a large area inhabited by wild rice and with shallow water that is relatively easy to pole through.
Have one person pole the canoe slowly through the wild rice.

,
Have another person knock the stems after bending them over into the canoe so the loose spikelets will drop into the canoe bottom.
Collect the wild rice on a tarp.
Let the rice dry out (takes about 2-3 days of dry weather).

,
Place the rice in a very large iron pan and parch it over the coals.
Once parched, put the rice in a pit lined with a hide.

,
The point now is to do the twist.
After the rice has been thoroughly trodden on (it took about 10 minutes for this small batch), it is taken out and placed in a large container for winnowing.

,
The winnowing is done with a downward motion of the container, which moves all the chaff to the front of the bowl (away from the person winnowing), where it can be rather easily removed.
Here is the completed, winnowed rice.

Hand wash your car normally.
Avoid thinners, solvents, and gasoline.
Use a pressure sprayer up to 1800 psi.
Go through an automatic car wash. Once again, if the Plasti Dip has been properly applied, has had time to cure, and isnâ€™t peeling, a trip through the average automatic car wash will have no negative impact on it.
Wash brake dust and grime off your wheels.

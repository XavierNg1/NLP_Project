Understand what a singly even square is.
Calculate the magic constant.
Divide the magic square into four quadrants of equal size.
Assign each quadrant a number range.
Solve each quadrant using the methodology for odd-numbered magic squares.
Create Highlights A and D.If you tried to add up your columns, rows, and diagonals right now, you’d notice that they don’t yet add up to your magic constant.
Swap Highlights A and D. This is a one-to-one swap; simply lift and replace the boxes between Quadrant A and Quadrant D without changing their order at all.
Do an additional swap for singly even magic squares larger than 6x6.

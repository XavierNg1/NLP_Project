Now comes the part where I tell you how to whistle the Rue's Mockingjay tune.
The Mockingjay whistle is rather high pitched, but most whistles are.
The second note is two steps higher than the first, at a very high B.
The third note is only a half-step lower than the second, at a high A.
The last note is a haunting high D. This should be easy to whistle, as it is a more 'normal' sounding note.

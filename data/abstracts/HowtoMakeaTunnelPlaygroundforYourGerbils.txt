When you're finished with toilet paper and paper towel cardboard tubes, get ready to reuse them!,
Once you have 3-5 tubes, or enough tubes that you can build the tunnels you want, you can begin the very first steps to making an intricate tunnel system.
Cut gerbil-sized holes every here and there, so they can come in and out as they please.
You will want to empty the cage of the bedding, and put it aside if it is still clean.
Watch your gerbils as they examine the openings, pretty soon they will disappear into the ground!

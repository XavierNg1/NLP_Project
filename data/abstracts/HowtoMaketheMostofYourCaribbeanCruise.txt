Before you select your cruise, research the places that your ship will stop at and choose the cruise that most appeals to you!,
Don't base your decision on the appeal of the ship alone - make sure you are provided with plenty of opportunity to explore once your ship is docked.

When booking your room, remember that you are barely spending anytime in your room; this is not like a hotel.
Once you've booked your cruise, research the destinations your cruise will be stopping at and find out what activities are available to you to participate in during your docked time.
While you are on your cruise, be friendly towards your new neighbors.
Make sure to take care of yourself.
Although you may have been up late last night enjoying the nightlife on your cruise, try not to sleep in!,
Check out the ship.
Finally, be sure not to sweat the small stuff, take lots of pictures, and enjoy every moment of your Caribbean cruise!

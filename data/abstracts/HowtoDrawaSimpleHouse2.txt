Draw a cube.
Draw two overlapping triangles on either side of the cube.
Connect the sides of each triangle in order to form your roof.
Add a large rectangle for the door, and a couple of squares or rectangles for windows.
Outline the image and erase overlapping lines.
Color it in and youâ€™re done!

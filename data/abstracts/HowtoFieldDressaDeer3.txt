Ensure the deer is deceased.
With the deer on its side, maneuver the deer so that its head is uphill if applicable.
Get out your supplies; a sharp knife, gloves, bottle of water if necessary (to wash your hands/arms off afterward).
At all times, be aware that the tarsal glands on the ankles of the deer have a strong musk and should not be handled.
Starting at the anus, take a smaller sharp knife and carefully cut the ring of hide surrounding the anus to detach it from the hide.
If you have a drag rope and a tree nearby, you can tie one of the deer's hind legs up at an angle against the tree to give you better access to the belly for dressing.
Locate the sternum.
Using your knife, very carefully create a slit in the hide where the sternum ends.
Insert two gloved fingers into the hide.
Using your fingers as a guide to LIFT the hide/thin muscle away from the gut pouch, slide your sharp short knife back into the slot and using one finger on either flat side of the knife, slide it down and cut down the length of the belly to the pelvic bone.
Gently roll the organs out of the body cavity, away from the spine.
Sever the diaphragm of the deer.
Remove the diaphragm by cutting around the perimeter of it, where it connects to all inner walls of the chest cavity.

,
There are a few ways to remove the heart, lungs, and trachea.
If not cutting the sternum then carefully reach up into the chest cavity from below.
Remove all connective tissues to free the guts from the rear end of the deer.If a hind leg of the deer is tied up, now release it.
Roll the deer back onto its belly, splaying both the front shoulders and hind legs to allow the deer to drain and cool for a few minutes.
Take a few minutes to clean up; select any organs that you wish to keep and set them aside.
Remove your deer and take it with you by whatever means.This method of dressing will also leave the deer's head/neck/shoulders in tact in case you wish to mount it.

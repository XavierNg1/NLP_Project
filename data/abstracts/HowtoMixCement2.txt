Pour a small amount of water, roughly half of a 5 gallon (18.9Â L) bucket, into the wheelbarrow.
Start with 3/4 of the dry mix.
Once incorporated, add the remaining 1/4 of dry mix to the soupy cement mix.
Pour the mixed cement immediately into your project's area.
Clean up your supplies as soon as possible.

Let your best friend know that you're bi.
The first thing to do is to introduce the idea of being bi to them, perhaps in a game of "Truth or Dare?",
Practice what you are going to say to them.
Get them somewhere where it is just the two of you.
Simply tell them, "I am bisexual.",
Answer any of their questions.
Give them time if they need it, but they shouldn't need too long if they really care about you.

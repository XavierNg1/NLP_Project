Hold the right motives.
Pray before your fast.
Meditate on the Gospel, and on the Holy traits of our Lord.
Determine the length of your fasting experience, whether this is for 1 meal, 1 day, 3 days or a week (Jesus and Moses fasted for a period of 40 days, but that is no sign that anyone else might do that).
Note the type of fast you are being called to.
Drink enough water to support life, since it is not a food, observing this Absolute Caution: In an absolute fast one abstains from solid and liquid "foods" -- for example, fruit juices are foods -- but, water is essential for life much as breathing, as one may go into a foggy mental state, then coma and die after a mere 2 or 3 days of dehydration.

,
Hold morning worship.
Go for a prayer walk.
Pray for the welfare of others.
Avoid gorging, as one of the recommended ways to return to a regular eating habit after fasting.

,
Gradually add in a raw salad the first day of breaking your fast.

,
The 2nd day, add a baked potato, avoiding any fat or salt on the potato.

,
The 3rd day, add a steamed vegetable.

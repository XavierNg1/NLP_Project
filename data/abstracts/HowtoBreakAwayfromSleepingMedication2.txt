Get into a regular sleep routine.
Avoid using the bedroom for activities other than sleep or sex.Many people have a television in their bedroom, or use their laptop computers, their tablets, or their cellphones in the bedroom prior to falling asleep at night.
Avoid mentally or emotionally engaging activities right before bed.For instance, avoid having a difficult or frustrating conversation with anybody in person or over the phone or Internet.
Go to bed immediately when you're feeling drowsy and when you have the need to sleep.Avoid forcing yourself to stay awake.
Ensure that adequate amounts of darkness are present in your sleeping space.
Exercise regularly.Exercise will help induce nightly sleep through giving your body a proper workout.
Avoid drinks and beverages high in sugar and caffeine.Any foods high in sugar will increase your energy levels thus making it difficult to fall asleep naturally.
Take a hot bath or warm shower before going to bed.
Seek cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) remedies if you're still experiencing an inability to break from sleeping medication through practical modifications to your lifestyle.

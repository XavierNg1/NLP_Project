Set up a furnace to melt your aluminum.
Locate your aluminum.
Find an ant bed you have access to.
Melt your aluminum.
Enlarge the entrance to the mound slightly and create a small depression around it for the aluminum to flow into.
Pour the molten aluminum carefully but quickly into the mound entrance.
Allow an hour or so for the aluminum to cool sufficiently to be touched.
Use a sharp pointed tool to probe the mound carefully, so you can determine the extent of the casting below the ground.
Uncover the top 6 to 12 inches (15.2 to 30.5Â cm) of the casting, so that you are level with the adjacent ground or slightly below it.
Dig a hole beside the mound about three feet deep, being careful to avoid damaging off-shoot tunnels or chambers.
Use a water hose to wash the dirt out from between the chambers and tunnels, as well as to expose more of the casting if you are near a water spigot.
Continue to remove the soil from around the casting until it becomes loose, the carefully pull it free of the ground.

Measure the height of the area where you will install the stairs.
Divide the total rise by the typical rise per step.
Divide the total rise by the number of steps to get the actual rise per step.
Establish the run of each step to get the total run of the staircase.
Calculate the length of the stringers.
Determine how you will attach the stairs to the existing structure.
Determine how many stringers you will need.
Lay out a sufficiently long piece of 2x12-inch (5cmx3m) lumber.
Mark a framer's square to the height and depth of your steps.
Modify the top of the stringer to account for the overall angle.
Measure and mark each step along the piece of lumber.
Use a circular saw or hand saw to cut the step-notches into the stringers.
Square off the bottom of the stringer so that it will sit flush with the ground.
Test the stringer by setting it in place.
Use the first stringer as a template off of which to base the next stringers.
Install the stringers.
Secure and stabilize the stringers by installing risers, or toe boards (optional).
Cut and install the risers.
Cut and install the treads.
Fit any trim board underneath the overhanging tread and nail to the riser.
Varnish, paint, or seal your steps if necessary.

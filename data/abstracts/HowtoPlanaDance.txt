Be committed.
Chose a theme for the dance.
Have a place to hold your party.
Decide who to invite.
Send out invitations three to four weeks prior to the event.
If you have a tight budget, then don't provide a lot of food for your guests.
Music is an easy one, just create a playlist with all the 'in' music on it.
When the day of the dance comes, you may want to decorate and prepare for it on that day.
Remember one thing whilst the dance is going on, have fun!

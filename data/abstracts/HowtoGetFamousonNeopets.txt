99% of famous people on Neopets are famous because someone (or the majority) dislikes them - examples Kaleena, Sam, Salena, Mandi, Curse etc.
Go on the Neoboards often.
There is a small minority who achieve a more dignified (and lasting) kind of fame through their pet pages.
Screenie pages have become a popular way of becoming 'neo-famous' as they are easy to make.
Another way to become famous is by making a lot of Neopoints.
Battledomers and Help Chat are especially close knit communities and members of these groups are most likely to know each other by name.
Yet another way to become famous is to own a popular guild.
Neopia is full of half-finished, abandoned guilds.

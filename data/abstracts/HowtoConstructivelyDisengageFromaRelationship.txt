Make up your mind once and for all that you want to quit.
Think of the best time and way to communicate your decision to disengage to your partner.
Expect the disengagement to take time.Disengagement will be tough unless you both reached the same conclusion at the same time.
Let your partner know that you have prepared your mind.
Be in touch with your ex if you think that this helps.

Select a suitable piece of wood for your project.
Square the stock.
Cut the stock to the desired length.
Mark the center of each end of your stock, and position it between the lathe centers.
Position the tool rest parallel to the length of the work piece, keeping it far enough back to allow the work piece to rotate without hitting it, but as close as possible.
Free spin, or hand turn the work piece to make sure it doesn't hit the tool rest.
Choose the chisel you will use for the turning operation.
Turn the lathe on, making sure it is at the lowest speed setting.
Feel the resistance of the cutting edge and watch the size of the chips being cut from the work piece.
Begin moving the cutting edge parallel to the rotation of the work piece, continuing to make a light cut along its length.
Continue pushing the tool into the stock gradually, in passes, so that you remove a roughly equal amount of wood with each pass.
Stop the lathe frequently when you are just beginning, to check your progress, look for stress cracks in the wood, and clear debris which may begin to accumulate on the lathe bed.
Smooth the finished round work piece by increasing your lathe speed, and holding your cutting tool so it barely contacts the wood, then moving it slowly along the work pieceâ€™s length.
Sand the work piece when you are finished cutting if desired.

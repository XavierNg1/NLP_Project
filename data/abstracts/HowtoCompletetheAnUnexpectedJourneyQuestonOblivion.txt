Speak with Ormil, the inn's High Elf publican, about a bed and rent one out.
Go to your rented room and sleep for however long you want by selecting the bed and choosing to sleep.
Wait until you wake up and a quest update will explain that the ship has somehow been put out to sea.

Open your room door and speak with the bandit Lynch who is standing outside in the way.
Kill Lynch and loot his corpse for the key to the storage room.
Free the inn's bouncer, the Orc Graman gro-Marad, from the storage room using the key you looted from Lynch.
Make your way back up the stairs to the main deck and speak with another bandit called Minx.
Kill Minx and loot her corpse for the key to the top deck of the ship.
Make your way outside to the top deck and speak to the bandit Wrath.
Kill Wrath and loot his corpse for the final key, which unlocks Ormil's private quarters in which Ormil is being held by Selene.
Enter the cabin behind the bar on the main deck where Selene is holding Ormil.

Decide whether you want to kill Selene or try to negotiate her surrender.
Talk to Ormil.
Make your way back down to your room and sleep for as long as you want by selecting the bed and choosing to sleep.
Talk to Ormil back up on the main deck and he will inform you that there was a bounty for Selene and he will reward you with a level-dependent amount of gold (ranging from 75 gold at level 1-4, up to 450 gold when you reach level 25 or higher).

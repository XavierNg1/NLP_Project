Be aware that clamping and cutting the umbilical cord are not necessary.
Expect your doctor to perform “immediate” clamping within the first moments of your baby’s life.
Keep in mind your doctor may do “delayed” clamping.
Understand the benefits of delayed clamping.
Talk to your doctor about which type of clamping you would prefer.
Make sure you have access to the right medical supplies.
If the cord is wrapped around your newborn’s neck, slide your finger under the cord.
Use sterile plastic clamps or sterile woven umbilical tape to tie off the cord.
Look for cord rings or cord banders at a medical supply store.
Always sterilize any woven materials like silk or a shoelace before using it to tie off the cord.
If you are using woven material, tie the knots firmly on the umbilical cord.
If you are using clamps or tape, put the first tie about 5 to 7.5 cm (2 to 3 inches) from the baby.
Prepare the umbilical cord by swabbing between the clamps or ties with antibacterial solution.
Use a sterile, sharp blade such as a scalpel or a strong pair of scissors.
Grasp the cord with a piece of gauze.
Cut cleanly between the ties or clamps.
Bath the baby within the first six hours of life.
Wash your hands with soap and water before and after caring for the stump.
Avoid touching the cord stump or exposing it to unclean substances.
Treat the cord stump with an antiseptic.
Apply the antiseptic daily or with diaper changes for at least 3 days.
Be aware of your option as a parent to collect and store your baby’s cord blood.
Keep in mind you can still collect your baby’s cord blood even if you use delayed clamping.

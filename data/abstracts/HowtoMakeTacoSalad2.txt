Combine the salsa and sour cream to make the dressing.
Heat the oil over medium heat in a medium-sized skillet, then add the onion and garlic.
Cook the onion and garlic until they turn soft.
Add the beef, and cook it for another 5 minutes, stirring often.
Add the tomatoes, beans, cumin, chili powder, and salt, and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes.
Take the skillet off the heat, then add the cilantro and half of the dressing.
Toss the remaining dressing with the lettuce in a large bowl.
Distribute the lettuce between 4 plates, then scoop the meat mixture on top.This will prevent the meat mixture from wiling the salad too much.
Garnish the salads with shredded cheese and tortilla chips, and serve.

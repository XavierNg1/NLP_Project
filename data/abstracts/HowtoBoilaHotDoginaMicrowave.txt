Take a fork and stick it into one or two hot dogs about a quarter of the way from the end at a good angle so that the fork's handle lies parallel to the hot dog for 3/4 of the hot dog's length.
Put the hot dog into a microwave safe plastic or glass tumbler that is taller than the hot dog, but not the fork.

,
Fill the glass up with COLD water to cover the hot dog (but not the fork).
Put the glass into the microwave.
For one hot dog cook on high two minutes, for two hot dogs cook three minutes.
Carefully remove the glass from the microwave, it will be hot since it contains boiling water.
If you like warm hot dog buns put them in the microwave for 10 seconds.

,
Use the fork to move the hot dog or hot dogs to their buns.

,
Finished.

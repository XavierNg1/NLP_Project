Understand what Lucid Dreaming is.
Set up the basics.

Enjoy.
Optional: Once your mind has gotten used to all the steps, you can experiment with replacing no more than 25-50% of your songs at a time and adding more energetic, aggressive or emotional songs (the ones you should avoid when setting up the basics).

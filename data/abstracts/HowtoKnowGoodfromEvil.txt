Realize that good and evil are points of view and while your own opinion matters, there are some universals.
Recognize both points of view.
Do your homework!,
Think about how you or your culture views right and wrong.
Write your views on good and bad down, then analyze them, rethink what truly is right and wrong.
Discuss your ideas on morality with others.
Observe others and yourself, you would be surprised at the number of people that do "wrong" things everyday.
Decide whether you want to be "good" or "evil", then do the things you wrote on your list that fits that category.

Completely remove any items you don't want painted, such as the bottom bracket or forks.
Degrease the bike.
Remove all of the existing paint with medium-grade sandpaper or rough sponge (80 grit) to form a smooth surface.
Hang the bike by the head tube to ensure that your paint does not clog up at the bottom bracket.
Apply a primer with very thin coats to provide the best finish.
Allow the frame to dry for about 24 hours.
Sand the primer using 220-grit paper/sponge.
Put on your main coat of paint.
Sand it down again after the paint dries, this time using some wet-or-dry 1200-grit paper.
Put stickers or decals on your bike (optional).
Apply the clear lacquer in the same way as you painted the bike; however, this time you may only need to put on 2 or 3 coats.
Complete the repainting of your bike by following the steps for the frame with the forks or any other part.
Finished.

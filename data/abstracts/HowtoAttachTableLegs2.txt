Purchase four table legs, T-nuts, nuts and hanger bolts at a home improvement store.
Drill four holes through the base of your tabletop.
Tap the T-nut into the hole with a hammer from the top of the base down.
Install four hanger bolts that match the size of the T-nuts into your table legs.
Twist the legs into the bottom of the base until they are even with the top.

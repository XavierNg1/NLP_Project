Get some holographic foil.
Start your manicure as you usually would, with a base coat and your favorite color.
Cut your foil down to nail-sized pieces using a pair of manicure scissors.
Paint on a thin layer of foil adhesive.It might be a good idea to do just one nail for now, otherwise the adhesive may dry out before you can get to it.
Wait 30 to 60 seconds for the adhesive to get tacky.If you are using top coat, it might take much longer than thatâ€”about 10 to 15 minutes.
Press the foil into your nails, foil-side-up.
Gently smooth the foil down with an orange wood stick.
Clean it up.
Finish off with a top coat.

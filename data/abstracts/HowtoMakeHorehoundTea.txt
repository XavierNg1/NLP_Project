Begin with a saucepan or metal teapot with cool water to brew horehound tea.
Pour a small amount of the hot water in an enamel, ceramic, or other non-metal but not plastic, heat-proof container, as the hot water will warm the pot.
Place fresh horehound leaves in the container, then pour the boiling water over the leaves, cover and steep.
Pour the boiling water over the horehound leaves, then allow them to steep for at least five minutes.
Strain the horehound tea through a fine mesh strainer or a piece of clean cheesecloth when the tea reaches the desired strength.

Prepare before you begin a no-shampoo routine.
Begin your routine by wetting your hair in the shower.

,
Wash your hair with a shampoo replacement.
Distribute a moisturizing conditioner throughout all of your hair.
Untangle using your fingers or a wide-toothed comb.
Let the conditioner sit in your hair for five minutes or so for extra moisture.
Do the final rinse of your hair with cool or cold water to decrease frizz and add shine.
Leave some conditioner in your hair, especially in dry sections like the ends.

,
Avoid waxes and silicones, ingredients that generally end in -cone, -conol or -xane, in hair products.
Apply a gel or mousse and leave-in to wet hair after showering (for curly or wavy hair).
Realize that there will be an adjustment period of two to four weeks.

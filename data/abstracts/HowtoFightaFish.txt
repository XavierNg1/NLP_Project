Take It Easy - The first thing to do is relax.
Steady As She Goes - When the fish slows down and stops taking more line, itâ€™s time to go to work.
Close The Deal - When the fish gets close, this is a critical time in the fight because often it will panic when it sees the boat.
Catch And Release - Use a net to land the fish.

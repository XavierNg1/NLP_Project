Gather your materials.
Wrap the screw with thin coated copper wire.
Loop the ends of the wire.
Attach the wire loops to your battery.
Use your magnet to pick things up.
Try a different type of nail or screw.You might find that different materials have different levels of magnetism.
Use a larger screw or nail.A larger screw or nail may also have more magnetic power than a small one because you can coil more copper wire around it.
Attach a larger battery.AA batteries work well for this experiment, but maybe a larger battery will make your electromagnet more powerful.
Add a switch.By adding a knife switch, you can control the flow of power with the push of a button.

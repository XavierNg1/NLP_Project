Examine the weaknesses of door sweeps and ready made thresholds.
To make your own door threshold, that fits like a glove, out of cardboard, you have to assemble some materials: cardboard, box cutter, paper glue, measuring tape, and duct tape (buy a color that matches your floor).

,
Measure the width of your doorway and the thickness of your door.
Plan on making your threshold a few inches wider than you doorway, so if your doorway is 30 inches (76.2 cm) wide make it 33 inches (83.8 cm).
Cut the strips of cardboard.
Stack and lightly glue the strips of cardboard together and let it dry awhile.

,
Do an initial fitting of the threshold to the base of the doorway.
When satisfied with the fit, turn the threshold over and duct tape the threshold to the floor and exactly under the door.

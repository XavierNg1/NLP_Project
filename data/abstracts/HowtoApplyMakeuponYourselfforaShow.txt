Have everything out in front of you in your workspace.
Start with concealer (for dark under-eyes and blemishes), followed by foundation and powder.
Next, move on to eye make-up.
Use lip-liner (either exactly matching or not, depending on the effect desired) to give your lips a definite edge and reduce the tendency of lipstick to bleed into creases around the lips.
Finally, apply blusher or tinted bronze powder.
Depending on the show and how vigorously you'll be exercising, you may want to finish with another layer of "translucent" powder.
When the show is over, remove your make-up as quickly as possible.
Finished.

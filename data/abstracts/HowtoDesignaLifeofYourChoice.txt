Don’t take your life for granted.
Be specific about what you want in life and from life.
Take risks, but don’t leave things to chance.
Follow people worth following.
Spend time to chalk out the path of your life.
Make concrete plans, but keep them flexible enough to be able to change them according to need and the situation.
Don't make the mistake of choosing what’s easy over what you really want to do.
Find a nice quiet spot where you will be undisturbed for at least 20 minutes.
Draw a time line across a page, from now to say five years on.

,
At the left end of the time line, write “Present State”; at the right end, write “Desired State”.
On the right side, under Desired State, describe as clearly as you can what you would like to see five years from now.
Between the Present State and Desired State, mark on the time line.
Note that the first time you try this exercise, you may not get all the answers you want.

See if he ignores you.
When he DOES get in contact with you, does he say you're annoying or "Don't talk to me" or "Stop texting me".
When he sees your attention on other boys, pay close attention to his reaction.
If he sees you with just people that get along with you in general,what's his point of view?,
Does he avoid you.
Does he talk bad about you to other people.
When you don't give him attention,does he care.
& From here on out, you'll see if he still wants to continue having you in his life.

Always remember this: "In the end, the truth ALWAYS comes out no matter what happens".

Remember this saying, to: "The More You Hate Someone, The More You love Someone.
~Good Luck & I Wish You The Best!!!!

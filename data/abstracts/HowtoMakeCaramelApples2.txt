Wash the apples and pull the stems off.
Insert a wooden stick into the top of each apple, and place the apples in the fridge.
Line a large baking sheet with wax paper.
Fill a saucepan with corn syrup, butter, sugar, and ¾ cups (180 milliliters) of heavy cream.
Heat the ingredients over medium to high heat until they reach 246°F (118.9°C), stirring occasionally.
Remove the saucepan from heat, and swirl in the vanilla extract and the rest of the heavy cream.
Let the caramel cool a little before dipping an apple into it.
Scrape the bottom of the apple with a spoon or knife.
Consider dipping the apple into a bowl filled with chopped nuts.
Place the apple onto the baking sheet, and immediately move onto the next apple.
Refrigerate the apples for 1 to 2 hours.
Finished.

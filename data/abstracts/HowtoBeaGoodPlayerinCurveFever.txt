Always try to make space.
Secure.
Camp appropriately.
Try not to start in the center.
Practice alone.
Always look for bigger spaces, but secure your original as much as you can.
Don’t underestimate your opponents!,
Never do moves, that is unnecessary!,
Don’t die for a powerup.
Planning is crucial.
Don’t try to slaughter everyone at once, because it is most likely you will be slaughtered first, but if someone is too close, take him down.

,
Look after players who are chasing other players.
Learn curving.
If someone invaded your space, shut down the way in immediately, but don't linger there too long; your enemy will try to break out, and you should be quicker, because he'll most likely to block your way out.

Confidence is everything.
Delay taking some powerups!,
Chase your opponents when you are faster than them!,
Trick your opponents with the reverse!,
Time your powerups!

Take a photograph of a koala's nose.
Look at the white/pale pattern inside and around the nostrils.
Now compare the first koala (Truganina) to this koala (Pat).
To make it easier, here is a comparison of the two koalas nose pattern target areas.
So once you've seen it, what do you do with this information?,
File the photograph in a folder on your computer for quick reference in future.
Trace the nose pattern with tracing paper over a printed photograph.
Use a computer graphics program.

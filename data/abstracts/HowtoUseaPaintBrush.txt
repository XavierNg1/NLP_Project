Pour a quart of the paint into a 4- or 5-qt.
Prepare the edges (optional).
Dip the brush bristles 1 to 2 in.
Start at the top of the board with the loaded brush and stroke down toward the middle.
Make long strokes.
Quickly coat an area with several brush loads of paint, and then blend and smooth it out by lightly running the unloaded brush tip over it - called “tipping”.
Cut in along the edges.
Clean the brush immediately after stopping.

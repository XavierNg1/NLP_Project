Get your puzzle book and rip out three used pages.
Fold the paper until it is the same as the approximate height of the can.

,
Start rolling the paper.
Once the wax is melted, put the rolled up paper in the can of hot wax.
Let the paper soak up the wax.
Once you determine that the paper rolls have soaked up enough (or you run out of wax), remove them from the can and lay them out to dry.
Once dried, these can be packed into a resealable plastic bag for toting anywhere.

Give your photos plastic surgery.
Be mysterious with your photo descriptions.
Make up Facebook friends if necessary.
Keep your “info” section short and sweet.
Do not update your status more than once a day.
Write funny and smart status updates.
Here's a method that doesn't even take faking it.
Comment on only a few status updates by friends.
Never appear as “available” to chat online.
Last but not least, live this life you're creating.

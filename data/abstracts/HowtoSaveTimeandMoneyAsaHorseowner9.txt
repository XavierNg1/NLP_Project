Turn out your horse as much as possible.
Buy tools that will work best.
Choose the best type of bedding for you.
Put a tarpaulin outside the stable door.
Muck out all the stables at the same time (either yourself or with others).
Position the muck heap within easy reach of the stables, but downwind, out of sight of the neighbours, and with access to a road.
Consider managing a deep litter bed.

Dress like Bella.
Consider her outfits in the books.
Remember her outfits from the movies:


dark, long-sleeved tee shirts
jeans
black-and-white Keds
boots
green dress

,
Think of Bella's overall style.
Dye your hair dark brown(chocolate color) if you want, but you if you don't feel comfortable with it, then don't do it.
Style your hair like Bella's.
Also in the movies, she wears a lot of thin headbands.

,
Do your makeup like Bella's.
Get brown contacts if your eyes aren't brown or at least dark.

,
Keep your skin it's natural color.
Bella goes for plain clothes that are dark colours, she doesn't wear frilly dresses her style is boy-ish but with little pieces of jewelry she makes it look more feminine.

Using a 4- or 6 foot (1.2 - 1.8 m) level, draw a vertical plumb line on the drywall 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) in from the rough opening.
Screw three brackets to back of door frame, beside the hinges.
Screw the other three brackets on the latch side of the door.
Place 1/2" (1.27 cm) blocks on the bottom of the floor for carpet, and 1/4" (0.635 cm) blocks for vinyl or laminate.

Learn the background of organometallic chemistry.
Be aware that metals have a very unique chemistry in comparison to other atoms in the periodic table.
Understand what the compounds are used for.
Use an analogy to help your understanding of the compounds.
Learn how organometallic compounds are used as reagents.
Be aware that organometallic chemistry involving the lithium and magnesium groups is completely different than that involved in the chemistry of the transition metals.
Look for examples.
Note that organolithium compounds are more basic than Gringard regents due to their being thermodynamically less stable.
Learn about homogeneous catalysis.
Note that there are some differences in categorizing.
Learn about the possible many industrial processes.
Learn about the last type of reaction.
Study the two ways to catalyze the reactions.

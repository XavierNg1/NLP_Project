Be content.
Count your blessings.
Simplify your life, and buy experiences instead of things.
Write a relationship mission plan to assure life's benefits: for although money is soon spent, your experience soon over -- leaving nothing tangible behind -- the experiences will stand internally, firmly within yourself and others with whom you share your experiences.
Donate generously, volunteer and give to the community: consider helping society and promoting good feelings and happiness in others to share in your life.
Foster collaboration and respect.
Stay comfortably in control of your life and finances.
Save and invest your money, and use your money to make more money.
Do something challenging that you enjoy and will have good chance of progress (toward success).
Bless others in their need, and share your own blessings and good fortune with the less fortunate, and especially those who are unable to repay your benefits.

,
Make time for your family, friends, and loved ones always -- in many ways.

,
Relax; worry less; never expect too much.

,
Loan some of your money to the needy -- as much as you can: but demand little or nothing in return from the deserving poor and the less able who need a boost -- a hand up, not just a hand out.

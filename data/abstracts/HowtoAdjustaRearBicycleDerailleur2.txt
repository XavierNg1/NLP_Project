Only adjust your limit screws if the chain is popping out on either side of the derailleur.
Turn the "H" (high) limit screw clockwise to prevent the chain from moving too far to the right, away from the bike.
Turn the "L" (low) limit screw clockwise to prevent the chain from moving too far to the left (and potentially into your wheel).
Shift to the high and low gears, visually confirming that the derailleur is lined up with the center of the gears.
Test both screws and watch to see when the derailleur moves if the H and L are no longer marked.

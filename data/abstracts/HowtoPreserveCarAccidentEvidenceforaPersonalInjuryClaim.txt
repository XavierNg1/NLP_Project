Try to keep yourself calm.
Once you are out of traffic, take out your advance warning devices (such as cones, flares, or reflectors) and put them around the accident scene to divert other cars away.
Call for help immediately.
While waiting for the police and/or ambulance unit, take this chance to collect as much evidence as you can.
If there is a tree or any elevation nearby, use it to get a bird's eye view.
For your own injuries, you may start taking pictures of it as well.
Get the names and addresses of those involved in the accident.
As soon as you are able, seek legal advice from a personal injury attorney in your locality.

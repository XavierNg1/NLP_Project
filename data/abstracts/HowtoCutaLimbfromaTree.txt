Plan your cut.
Cut the limb from the underside about 1/2 way through but stop before the saw binds.
Make a second cut at ‘B’, slightly further out on the limb and from the top.

,
Allow the branch to break free and fall under its own weight.

,
Cut the remaining stub off from ‘E’ to ‘F’,(to prevent tearing the bark make a small cut at 'F' first) make the cut close to the main trunk.
Cut flush with the outer edge of the branch collar, and healing will proceed much faster.

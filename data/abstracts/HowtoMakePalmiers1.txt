Sprinkle sugar generously on a flat, clean work surface.
Remove the pastry from the freezer and lay it out on the sugar surface, working quickly.
Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough to 1/4" thickness.
Optionally, brush the top of the pastry with an egg wash. To make an egg wash, simply whip up a cracked egg with a fork, then add a tablespoon of water.
Coat the top of the pastry with sugar.
Roll the two long ends towards each other, meeting in the middle.
Cover the roll with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 450ÂºF and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Remove the roll from the fridge and douse with egg wash and more sugar.
Slice the pastry roll across the width, making roughly 1/2" cookies.
Brush the tops of the cookies with a bit more sugar and lay them down on the lined baking sheet.
Cook the palmiers for 4-5 minutes, then flip and cook until golden brown.
Cool the cookies on a wire rack for perfect crunchiness.

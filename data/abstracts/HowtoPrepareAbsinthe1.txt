Pour about one ounce (30ml) of absinthe into a glass.
Lay a flat, perforated absinthe spoon across the rim of the glass, and place a single cube of sugar on the perforated area of the spoon.
Drip very pure ice cold water into the absinthe from a small pitcher.
Stir the drink with the absinthe spoon after the water has been added.

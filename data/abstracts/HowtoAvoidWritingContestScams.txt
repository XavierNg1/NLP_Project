Think twice before sending money.
Determine the legitimacy of entry fees.
Examine contest rules to determine if the sponsor is really a vanity publisher in disguise.

Look for the red flags that tell you a contest is a scam:


Does the sponsor publish the names and works of previous winners?,
Make sure all prizes are awarded.
Never sign away the rights to your work.

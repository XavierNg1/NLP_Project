Forget everything you think you know about cougars.
Determine the woman’s age.
Evaluate her makeup.
Don’t think you can judge her by her fashion sense.
Pay attention to her self-confidence.
Know what you want, and be honest about it.
Forget the stereotype.
Show her you’re interested.
Be prepared for rejection, and take it gracefully.
Be “young.” If you are trying to attract an older woman, don’t get stuck on the idea that you need to act like a man their age might act.
Be honest about who you are.
Be reliable and uncomplicated.

Evaluate your level of risk for colon cancer.Everyone is eligible for colon cancer screening beginning at the age of 50; however, if you have a family history of colon cancer, or a personal history of inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, both of which increase your risk of developing colon cancer) you may be eligible to begin screening earlier.
Obtain the testing package.The first thing you will need to do in order to self-screen for colon cancer is to obtain the at-home stool testing package.
Collect the required number of stool samples.
Store the stool sample at room temperature.
Send the stool sample back to the lab.After you have collected your sample and placed it in the appropriate areas of the packaging, you will need to return it to the lab for analysis.
Book a follow-up appointment to review your results.After the lab has finished analyzing your stool, you will want to go in to see your family doctor again to review the results of your stool test.

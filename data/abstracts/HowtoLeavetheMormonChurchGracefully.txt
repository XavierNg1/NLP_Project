Think long and hard about what you are deciding to do.
Write out a list of reasons why you are leaving the church.
Do some research on the actual doctrines and practices of the Church over time.
Many ex-Mormons and people considering leaving the church find it helpful to seek out and talk to or read blogs and articles by others who have left the church.
Don't try to explain to others why you are leaving.
Stop going to church activities.
Tell those who ask about you that you appreciate their concern and that you are searching your heart to make decisions that are right for you.
Find something to do that makes you feel good on days you would normally go to church related activities and programs.
If you made a final decision, write a letter to Church Records.

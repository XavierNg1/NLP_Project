To solve a trig inequality, transform it into many basic trig inequalities.
Learn the 4 types of basic trig inequalities:


sin x > a (or < a)  ; cos x > a (or < a)
tan x > a (or < a) ; cot x > a (or < a)

,
To know how to solve these basic trig inequalities, see book titled "Trigonometry: Solving trigonometric equations and inequalities" (Amazon e-book 2010).
If the trig inequality contains only one trig function, solve it as a basic trig inequality.
Step 1.Transform the given trig inequality into standard form R> 0 (or < 0).
Step 2.
Step 3.
Step 4.
Set up a Sign Table in which the top line figures all the values of x progressively varying from 0 to 2Pi.

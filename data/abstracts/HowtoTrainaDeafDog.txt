Teach your dog to respond to hand signals.
Accompany hand signals with the appropriate voice command during obedience lessons.
Reward your dog with a treat, toy, pat on the head, or some other favorable response when he does something you want him to do again.
Expand your dog's "vocabulary" beyond the signs used for formal commands.
Restrict obedience lessons to about 15 minutes when training deaf dogs.

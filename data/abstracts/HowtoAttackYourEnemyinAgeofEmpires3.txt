You need to have a balanced army.
Get your troops together at an area in your village.
Try to surprise the enemy.
Attack from different directions.
What do you want to attack first?,
Don't watch the whole fight at the front, switch to your village sometimes.
But that's not the main point.
Attacking is the best defense.
Don't get stressed.
Don't be scared to attack!

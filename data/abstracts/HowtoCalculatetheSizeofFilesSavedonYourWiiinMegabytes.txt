Learn the formula: FSM=(512÷THB)×FSB, where FSM is the total file size in MB, THB is total hard disk capacity in blocks, and FSB is file size in blocks.
Determine the total amount of blocks on your Wii's hard disk.
You should now have the total amount of blocks on the Wii's hard disc.
Look to see that you should now have the approximate size of a channel, or game save, etc.

Send your assistant, who is also completely fluent in this trick, out of the room.
Shuffle a standard deck of cards.

,
Deal out cards face up onto a table.
Watch the cards very carefully as you are dealing, keeping an eye out for the numbered cards 4,5,6,7,8,9 or 10.
Consider this random deal of cards: Say that, on the first deal, an Ace comes up -- place the card toward the top of the table in line with your left arm.
Ask your mark, once the cards are laid out, to choose one card by touching the face of the card.

,
Direct your assistant to come back into the room.
Ask your assistant what card was chosen using the following method: Touch one of the cards on the table (in the same manner as the card was chosen) and say "Was this the card?",
When you touch the "control" card, touch the pip on the card whose position indicates the chosen card.

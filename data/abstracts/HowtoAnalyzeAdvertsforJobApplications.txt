Look very carefully at each advert that is of interest to you.
When you get a feel for what the job is about and what's expected of an applicant, set about reading "between the lines", to uncover what's not openly stated.
Once you've worked out what the job is all about, take a highlighter pen and mark every clause or phrase where it states what the actual requirements are.

,
Read the advert again carefully to see if these needs are essential or merely desirable.
Look for the crucial need (if there is one).
For your own sake in terms of future fulfillment in the job, consider what outcomes you'd be expected to achieve in this job and whether you feel capable of this.
When you have done all this analysis and you still see a good match, go ahead and draft your response letter.

Please don't use geocaching abbreviation-only and "lingo"-only logs.
Be precise about geocoins and trackables.
Treat the cache as your own and log down any conditions.
Take the time out to record in detail any experiences encountered on your journey.
Avoid leaving any clues.
Take pictures around the area, never of the actual cache position.

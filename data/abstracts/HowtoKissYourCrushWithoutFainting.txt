First off, know that you won't (usually) pass out or faint.
Unsure of how to kiss?,
Keep your lips soft and kissable.
Make sure you're on good enough terms with your crush that kissing is okay with them.
After you've made sure they're comfortable with it, hint for one.
Kissing is a two way street - both people need to be engaged and willing.
If you get nervous, relax, take a breath when they exhale (you'll literally take their breath away).

Focus on the kiss.
After the kiss, break away by just a few inches, and smile to let them know you liked it.

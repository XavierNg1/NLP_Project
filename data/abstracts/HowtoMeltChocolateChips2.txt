Put the chocolate chips into a wide, shallow microwave-safe bowl.It is important that the container you use remains cool or very slightly warm after several minutes of microwaving, otherwise, the container itself will overheat the chocolate.
Microwave the chocolate on medium power for 1 minute, then give it a stir.You can stir the chocolate with a rubber spatula or a spoon, but make sure that whatever you use is dry.
Continue heating the chocolate at 10 to 15-second intervals, stirring between each one, until it is almost melted.
Take the chocolate out of the microwave and continue stirring the chocolate until it turns smooth.
Use your chocolate.

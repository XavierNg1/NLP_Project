Admit you have a problem.
Stop communicating with people through Myspace and correspond with only those you know, as fellow addicts only contribute to your problem.
Print out your page.
Start deleting all of the images, comment boxes, background settings, songs, videos, and anything else you put on the page that didn't come with it.
Post several bulletins announcing that you will be no longer available on Myspace.
Change the headline to "No Longer Available" or some other indicator that you no longer use Myspace.

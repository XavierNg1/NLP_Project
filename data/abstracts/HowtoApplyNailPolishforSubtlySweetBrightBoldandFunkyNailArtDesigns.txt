Condition your hands first.
To start any nail work you do, soak hands in warm water with some oil or wash in them.
Just adding color to nails takes a shorter time ( only 10-15 minutes) that nail art (at least half an hour), so set it around the time you do have so that they do not get smudged and so possibly ruined.

Find a piercer that is experienced in the type of piercing you want.
Decide how high the risk of rejection is with your piercing.
Choose appropriate jewelry.
Make sure the gauge is large enough.
Have your piercer double check the placement for proper depth.

Take good care of your piercing, clean it daily with soap and water, use sea salt soaks, and never touch it with dirty hands.
See your piercer if it seems your piercing is rejecting, if there's redness outside the holes, or it looks like the holes are getting larger.

If you think your body is rejecting the jewelry, do not remove the jewelry yourself.

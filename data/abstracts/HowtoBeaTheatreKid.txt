Look the Part: One of the best things about being a theatre kid is that you can look the way you want.
Sing everywhere you go!,
Find your Dedication to the arts: The core group of theatre kids are those who have found their passion in the art and are tirelessly devoting themselves to it.
Be willing to try to fail...and try to fail again: Theatre, as an art, is difficult.
Don't Judge Others: Theatre kids often feel judged by other groups, so don't turn around and do it too.

The goal of Mahjong is to clear the board by removing all the tiles from the original layout and setting them up into four sets and one pair (a "Mahjong").
The game uses 136 tiles.
There is also a dice that is rolled in order to decide how the tiles are dealt.

,
Start with four players.
Choose a starting dealer.
Go over the rules with all the players.
Set up stands for each player, which will keep the wall of tiles in place.

,
The dealer shuffles the four wind tiles and deals them to the players.
The dealer then shuffles all the tiles on the table face down.

,
Each player takes 34 tiles and keeps them face down.

,
Players then should stack their tiles in a "wall" that is 17 tiles across and two tiles high.
The dealer rolls the dice.
The dealer deals tiles in a clockwise fashion to each player.
The dealer starts by discarding a tile.
The next player discards a tile.
Then the player to that person's right (South) should discard a tile face up and either pick one up from the discarded tiles or from the wall.

,
Continue discarding and picking up a tile with each player in a clockwise fashion.

,
The players should continue until someone wins by declaring Mahjong or all the tiles are used up.

,
Calculate the score at the end.

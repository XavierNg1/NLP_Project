Get a plastic bottle.
Poke 4 to 5 holes in the cap.
Cut the bottom off of the bottle.
Dig a hole into the soil.
Place the bottle into the hole, cap-side-down.
Fill the bottle with water, and invert the bottom of the bottle so it rests on the water, ready to catch any debris that would otherwise sink and clog the system.

Do your research well.
Bring your current trade-in car to a Toyota dealership.
Test drive a Prius.
Have the dealer explain some of the other features of the Prius you are currently driving.
Take it back to the dealership.
Plan if you will be able to afford the car in the upcoming months to years.
Have a co-signer there when you start the lease/loan.
Follow all directions to purchase the car.
Say goodbye to the sales-fellow, as you walk out of the dealership happy.
Wait for the car to either be cleaned up or shipped to the dealership.

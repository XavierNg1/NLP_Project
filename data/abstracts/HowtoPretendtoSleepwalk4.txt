Remember nothing if you’re “woken up”.It’s very common for a sleepwalker to recall nothing from the sleepwalking event, even immediately after it happens.
Deny that the episode happened.
Have no recollection of the event the next morning.Your sleepwalking episode will no doubt be the first topic of the morning, so be prepared to look completely confused and claim to have no recollection whatsoever about what transpired.
Act out of sorts the next day.

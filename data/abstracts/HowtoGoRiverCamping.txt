Decide whether you'll choose an existing campsite alongside a river or you're wanting to make out your own campsite.
If kayaking, canoeing or boating, get a map which shows you where it is safe to stop and camp.
Never camp in a dry riverbed.
Camp higher than the river.
Find a suitable place to do your toileting and washing.
Tell someone if you're wandering off, going fishing, sitting on a rock ledge over the river, etc.
Watch out for dangers.
Use your campsite as a base if you like.
Set up activities to do.

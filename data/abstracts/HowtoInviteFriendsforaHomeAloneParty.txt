If you are going to text your friends to invite them, be casual and tell them where and when that party is.
Although inviting friends is the easy part, it's the getting ready and setting up everything that takes a little longer.
Music.
You might want to invite 1, 2, or 3 close friends round first so that when everybody shows up, it won't be just you there.
Get dressed into a nice dress or nice outfit .
Remember it's officially a party only if you and your friends post lists of pictures to social media!,
Have a good night and be a responsible host.Make sure there is plenty of time before your parents are getting back and when the party ends, because it will be awkward whether you had their permission or not.Your parents are trusting you to be home alone with people they may or may not know, So accept your parents' opinion and ask them if they have any rules they want you and your friends to follow,Never invite the opposite gender that could get you in serious trouble it may harm you if no grown ups are around.
If your party is expected to get a little louder, and you have sensitive neighbors, make sure to inform them that you plan on having a party.
Make sure you're having a great time!

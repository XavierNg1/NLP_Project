What you will need to do.
Get a recliner generally called a Lazy Boy of the type used by Frasier's father's (TV show).
The chair may be set in a permanent reclining position or adjusted with each sitting.
This system takes a little work but is worth it to be pain free.
The board may be finish grade fir, 1 inch (2.5 cm) by 8 inches (20.3 cm) or 1" x 8", where the keyboard is 7 inches (17.8 cm) in width.
The monitor is set on a table adjusted to a height easy on the eyes with one's head rested against the back of the chair.
The mouse pad should be placed on a table to the right or left of the chair, as close as possible to the arm.
For people with mouse associated problems around the shoulders and neck, one can have mouse stands on both sides of the chair and switch the mouse to either side, assuming one learns to use both hands with the same mouse setting, and not having to change right/left handed system settings each time.
Finished.

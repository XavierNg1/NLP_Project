Consider one wire from the AC adapter the positive terminal.
Connect the positive wire from the AC adapter to the side of the diode without the stripe marking on it.
Locate the lead on the side of the capacitor that has a stripe.
Connect the remaining terminal of the capacitor to the terminal of the diode with the stripe.
Connect Pin 1 of the voltage regulator IC to the node where the positive side of the capacitor and striped side of the diode connect.

Look at your problem.
Check the equation for varying terms and constant terms.
Prepare to move the numbers around so that the varying terms are on one side and the constant terms are on the side such as in 16x−5x=32−10{\displaystyle 16x-5x=32-10} (that equation is solved in example 2).
Move the varying terms to one side of the equation.
Bring all the constant terms onto the other side of the equation.
Divide both sides by the coefficient of x{\displaystyle x}.

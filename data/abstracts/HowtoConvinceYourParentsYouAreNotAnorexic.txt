Spend more time with your parents.
Eat in front of them.
Tell them you are insulted if they ask you directly.
Stop spending hours looking at teen magazines, or at least while your parents are looking.
Show you are happy with your body.
Listen if your parents comment on your slight frame (and you know they are hinting towards an eating disorder) say you hadn't noticed.
Talk openly about food.
Practice honesty and don't be caught out lying.
Forgive them if you get angry with their attempts to "help" you.
Understand that if you know you are very thin but sure you don't have an eating disorder then try to put on some weight.

If possible, have someone else drive for awhile until you are used to how people drive in the area.
If you drive a car with a manual transmission, prepare for a leg workout if you get caught in rush hour bumper-to-bumper traffic.
Follow some basic rules of thumb.
Always use your signal for turning and changing lanes.
If you realize you aren't in the correct lane for a turn at an intersection, don't try to turn anyway.
If you see someone signaling that they need to get into your lane, slow down a bit and give them room.
If someone signals to change lanes from your lane to another lane, DO NOT try to crowd them out by passing them on that side before they can switch lanes.
Another issue that is common sense, but seems to often be forgotten, is that when there is more than one lane in one direction, you turn right only from the rightmost lane and left only from the leftmost lane unless otherwise marked.
If you wave to people, don't be offended if they don't wave back.
Don't be too upset if someone flips you off.
Enjoy your drive!

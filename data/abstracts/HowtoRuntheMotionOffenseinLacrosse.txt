Set up your offense.Place a cone to mark the 7 starting spots of the Motion Offense.
Inform players of the following options that the ball carrier has in the motion offense:

Going to goal
Passing to an adjacent
Switching Positions

Start with the play setup.
If the ball carrier does not have a clear path to goal, she stall the play by getting into one of the seven spots and wait for her teammates to set up Motion.

Explain to the ball carrier that the next option should be a look to pass.
After the ball carrier has passed it to an adjacent, have the previous ball carrier make a cut towards goal.
Have the ball carriers continue to pass to their left or right adjacent, then cutting towards the goal.
If a player is having a hard time getting the ball to her adjacent, she can also switch her location in the motion offense.
Off-ball players can switch places with other off-ball players as well.
Be the first player to all ground balls.
Be patient.

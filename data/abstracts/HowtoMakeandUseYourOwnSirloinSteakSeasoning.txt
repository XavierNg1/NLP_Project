Drop one tablespoon of mustard on each steak and spread it evenly over the steak.
Pour a little bit of vegetable oil into a pan and fry the steaks on each side until nicely browned.
Turn the heat down to medium.
Put the steaks into the sauce (be sure to pour in any meat juices that were in the plate!).
After the steak has been cooked to your liking, turn off the heat.

Figure out how much premixed concrete you will need for your project.
Prepare any forms you will need to hold the concrete, and grade and compact the soil or subgrade material.
Purchase the premixed product you have chosen to use.
Gather the materials you will need to complete your project.
Open a bag of your concrete mix and pour it into your mixing container.
Make a small depression or hole in the dry material in the center of the container, using a shovel or mixing hoe.
Alternatively, when mixing concrete in a wheelbarrow, the water is added first and dry mix introduced after.
The water/concrete ratio is determined by the volume of Portland cement in the bag, not bag gross weight.
When mixing with the shovel, as funny or odd as may seem, the shovel is paddled through the mix just like canoeing.
Stir the material and water, using a shovel or mixing hoe, so all the material is wet.
Continue mixing for a minute or two to completely mix the water into the concrete mixture.
Place your concrete into your form, smoothing the surface with a shovel or other tool so any additional concrete you need to finish the job can be easily estimated.

,
Float your concrete after it is placed and rodded off with a straight-edge or screed board.
Finish the concrete according to your own requirements or the requirements of the project design.
,
Barricade the area around the concrete to prevent passersby from stepping into it (which could ruin your finished project) and allow it to set and cure.
The technique to properly cure horizontal poured concrete, so will set over time to maximum strength and integrity, is to prevent the water added and mixed with the concrete in the barrow from evaporating away from the newly poured and troweled slab or other surface.
An alternative to mixing with a shovel and wheelbarrow is to mix in a standard five gallon bucked using a mixing drill with a "whip" attachment.

First, begin by deciding what your song will be about.
Now, you're going to wrap a story around this topic.
Now you've thought of a story, start writing!

,
For the first two to three verses, set the scene by describing what is happening, making sure you suck the listener into this song's world.
If the song has a chorus, it's good to not include the chorus too much - only at points where it is required.
Now continue your story, implementing as many of the ideas that you decided to try as you can.
Once you've written a few verses, add in a twist.
Remember to make your song poetic.
But also remember to not overdo it as well.
But don't stop at creative words.
Make sure the song has some sort of meaning.
Once the lyrics are finished, you can give your song a title.
Add finishing touches.
And there you have it, a set of lyrics to a progressive rock song that you've wrote and are quite rightly yours!

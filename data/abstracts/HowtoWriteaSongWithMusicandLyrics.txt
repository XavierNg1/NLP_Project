Think about what you want to write about.
Once you know what you want to write about, start thinking about songs you've heard, with the same kind of feeling.
If you have a piano, try making a basic melody.
Hum your melody and add things to it until you are satisfied.
Start writing your story.
Put the music and Lyrics together.

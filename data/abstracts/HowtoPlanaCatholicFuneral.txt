Speak with the Priest about your wish to prepare a Catholic funeral.
In larger cities, there is usually a funeral home where you will receive advice about caskets and burials and a time for friends and family to visit with the deceased, whether it is for private prayer or for a personal paying of respect.
It is good to have someone at home who will answer the telephone and answer questions about the funeral and things of that nature, someone who can help keep things organized.
In smaller communities or towns, it is customary for the family to arrange for the making of a cross with which to mark the grave.
The funeral is usually followed by a Reception or Lunch in a prearranged place.
Everyone grieves in their own way and at their own speed.

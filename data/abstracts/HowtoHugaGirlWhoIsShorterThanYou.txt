Approach the girl from the side you intend to hug.
Tighten your arm with your hand at her shoulder.
Embrace for a moment and release.
Get close to the girl you’re hugging.
Bend at the waist and put your arms forward.
Stay bent for the duration of the hug.
Release after a few seconds.
Don’t make it awkward.
Don’t just stand there.
Keep your arms away from their neck and head.
Don’t lift her up unless she asks.

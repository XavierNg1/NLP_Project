Make a list of essential items.
Read circulars, compare the deals each store has that week and clip coupons.
Estimate the total amount of money you will spend on these items.
Comparison shop for relatively expensive items before you make your final purchase decision.
Bring along a friend that acts motherly or very, very cheap; they will help you find bargains and help you stick to buying only what is on your list.

,
Only buy what is on the list!,
After paying your bill, do not use the change to go back to buy more.

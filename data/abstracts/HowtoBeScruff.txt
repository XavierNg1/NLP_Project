Don't care.
Look the part- scruff clothes include ripped jeans, band tees, tees with a witty message written on, Doc Martens, Converse, Vans... as long as it's not a brand name like Lacoste or Nike, anything goes.
If you are a boy or like to dress as a boy, wear ripped jeans (rip them yourself with a razor), a band tee, flannel shirts are cool too.
If you are a girl or like to dress as a girl, wear holey leggings, jeans mini skirts, tops with skulls, Doc Martens or Converse, and a few hippie bracelets.
Leave your hair looking scruffy and dirty.
Apply minimal makeup.
Pick your bands.
Have a signature about your look, something that everyone sees or hears and immediately thinks of you.
Remember, not caring doesn't mean hurting people and then laughing about it, it's about having a laid back attitude and taking life as it comes.

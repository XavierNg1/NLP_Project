Obtain a long, thin piece of your material.
Using calipers, carefully measure the diameter of the sample.
Calculate the cross-sectional area of the sample.
Thread one end of your sample through the grips at the base of the machine.
Measure the initial length of the sample in the machine using the calipers.
Select your strain rate.
Open the software on your computer.
Click start on the software, then press the up arrow button on the tensile testing machine.
Let the trial run until the sample breaks.
Click the stop button on the computer software.
Click the save button on the computer software.
Copy the data from the .txt file into a spreadsheet document.
Adjust the travel data to represent change in length over time.
Find strain using the change in length data.
Calculate stress by writing a code to divide the load by the cross-sectional area.
Graph the stress-strain curve (optional).

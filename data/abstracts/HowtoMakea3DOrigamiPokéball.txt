Become familiar with the general design of the project.
Make your collection of origami pieces.
Make sure you have enough pieces for the model.
Begin with 2 white pieces just made.
Assemble them by putting the leg of one into the pocket of another.
Spread out and fill in the remaining parts of the base, repeating the prior two steps.

,
When enough pieces have been made and put together, the base should look like this.

,
Repeat the steps with layers and gradually add on to the ball as a whole.

,
Go along layer-by-layer, using the same guideline as before to attach the pieces together.

,
Shape the ball along the process so that the pieces radiate outward and form a spherical shape.
Add layers, keeping the main shape in mind as the process continues.
Create the middle part of the Pokéball design.
Form the circular shape of the Pokéball button with the black pieces.

,
Finish the layer.
Start building the red layers.
Complete the shape of the button using the black pieces.
Resume the layering process for the remaining red layers.

,
Remember to form a rounded shape along the way to maintain the shape of a ball.

,
Finish the Pokéball by building the final layer.

,
Carefully squish the ball inward to form a more perfect circular shape.

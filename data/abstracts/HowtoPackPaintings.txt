Take your paintings off the wall and place them on a flat, stable surface.
Make an "X" across the front of the paintings with masking tape if they are framed with glass.
Cover the glass or top of the painting with a piece of heavy cardboard.
Wrap the paintings in a thick layer of bubble wrap.
Look for boxes that are appropriately sized for your paintings.
Place paintings one at a time inside the boxes.
Gently move the box back and forth to see if the painting can move.
Close the boxes and use packing tape to seal up all the edges.

,
Write "Fragile" with thick black marker on the side of the box so the people moving it will know that something breakable and valuable is inside.

,
Use a telescopic box if your painting is too large for the average sized boxes that you get from shipping supply stores or other retailers.

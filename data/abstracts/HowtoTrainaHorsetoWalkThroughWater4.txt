Use a route with a flat, broad bank.If the bank into or out of the water is steep, crumbling, or strewn with loose rocks and roots, it offers many more risks than a bank that is part of a flat, clear, well-trod route.
Check the water.
Cross at the narrowest points of the river or stream.The route will be easier when you choose to cross a body of flowing water that is relatively narrow.

Think of the numbers you want to multiply.
Make two columns.
Halve the number in the left column repeatedly.Divide the number at the top of the left column by 2 continually until you get to 1.
Double the number in the right column until the columns are the same length.Multiply the number in the second column by 2 until there are the same amount of numbers here as there are in the first column.
Cross out rows with an even number in the left column.Using your pen, strike through those horizontal rows which begin with an even number in the left column.
Find the sum of the remaining numbers in the right column.Add the numbers in the right column that you did not strike through.

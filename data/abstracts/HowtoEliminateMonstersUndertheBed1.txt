Comfort your child with encouraging words.
Obtain a general description of the monster.
Believe what your child tells you.
Take your child out of the room with you; into the kitchen is probably best.
Prepare a small snack for your child (such as an orange or banana).
Take down the "Monster Spray" and explain that your mother/father always kept a bottle or can of "Monster Spray" in the house when you were little and had monsters in your room, too.
Go into the "scary place" and squirt "Monster Spray" under the bed, in the floor area of the closet, and around the windows.
Bring your child back into the room where you can perform a final inspection together.
Encourage your child back into bed and remain with him/her for a few minutes.
If you are a busy Mom/Dad with other children or are unable to do the story, song, etc.
If all else fails then you can simply invest in a bed which doesn't have any space underneath, or cut the legs off the current bed.

Take a picture of the area of your body you wish to match.
Purchase the dye.
Follow the instructions on the package.
Tape or pin up your picture near your dyeing container.
Remember that dye can permanently stain some surfaces, so avoid dying in a ceramic or porcelain sink.
If the item is not dark enough, place it back into the dye bath and repeat the steps until it is the desired color.

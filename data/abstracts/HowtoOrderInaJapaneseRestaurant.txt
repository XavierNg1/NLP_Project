See if the restaurant has an online menu.
Ask about prices.
Learn numbers (so you will understand what they say or what is written on the menu): ichi (一)=1; ni (二)=2; san (三)=3; shi/yon (四)=4; go (五)=5; roku (六)=6; shichi/nana (七)=7; hachi (八)=8; kyuu (九)=9; juu (十)=10; hyaku (百)=100; and sen (千)=1000.
Order your food.
Do your best to read and pronounce the menu items you want.
When specifying how much of something you want, remember these words.
After naming your menu item and how many of it you want, conclude your order with Onegaishimasu to be polite.
When you have ordered and received your food, if you are asked 'Daijoubu desu ka?,
Do not pass food between your chopsticks; this looks like you are in a funeral.
If you are eating noodles, slurp; it's normal.

,
Don't stick your chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice.
Say 'itadakimasu' before eating; this means "I receive (this meal)".

,
To express your pleasure at the end of the meal, say 'Gochisousama deshita' meaning "It was a feast.",
It's a bit old fashioned, but very polite if after paying for your meal you tell the clerk, "Gochisousama deshita".

Ask yourself what it is that you want to share with your students.
Write down what you have to offer your prospective students.
Once you've decided what your class is going to cover, decide how many lessons and/or classes it will take to teach this information.
As you plan your classes, you will need to consider locations.
The next step is to fine tune your lesson plan.
A month or so before your class, start getting the word out.
The day of the class, make sure you have all the supplies you need, and arrive early.
After the class, make sure to get feedback from the students!

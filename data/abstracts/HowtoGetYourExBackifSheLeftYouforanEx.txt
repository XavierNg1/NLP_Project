(Short Version): Your best bet is to move onto other girls.
Prevention is better than cure: Try to understand why she left you in the first place and learn from it so if you do get her back she won't leave again.
Keep your contact with your ex friendly, casual, and lighthearted.
Make sure you smell good and have good hygiene.
Dress nice and act confident every day.
Surround yourself with friends and be social so she sees that you are moving on.
When you talk to her, be in a relaxed, strong, positive state of mind.
Eye contact is key.
Begin dating other girls ASAP.
Try to run into her.
Don't push things too fast.
THE KISS- when given the chance, make it long and sensual.

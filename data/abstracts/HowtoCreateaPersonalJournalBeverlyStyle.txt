Buy yourself a college composition notebook from the dollar store.
Decide how you'd like to decorate the outside cover.

,
Using decorative cardstock, place the notebook in the middle of the cardstock.
Using a different design cardstock but complementing the other, cover the binding of the notebook.
Now using that same color cardstock that you used for the binding, cut two pieces because you will be using that to decorate the inside of the covers.
If you want to use ribbon for closing the journal, place one piece of the ribbon under the cardstock from step #6 before gluing the paper down.

,
Same with if you'd like to decorate the outside middle binding.
Decorate the outside however you'd like by placing a label with a title saying it is your journal or recipe book or "Private" or whatever you want it to say.

,
Then inside you will want to start with the beginning page.

Gather your supplies.
Choose the emoji stickers you want to use.
Cut out the pieces of the file folder with your emoji stickers on it.
When you've cut out your emojis, take your sewing needle and make a small hole in the little space at the top of your sticker.
Insert the earrings where you poked the holes with the needle.

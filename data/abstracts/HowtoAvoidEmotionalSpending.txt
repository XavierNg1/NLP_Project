Acknowledge the triggers that lead you to indulge in emotional spending so you can consciously avoid them.
Change your habits by finding other ways to spend your time so you're not spending your money haphazardly and irresponsibly.
Track your emotional spending totals for a week by keeping your receipts and circling everything you didn't absolutely need to have, things you bought on a whim.
Plan out a workable monthly budget that includes setting aside money for an emergency, for something big you want to save toward, and for your regular necessities, and then stick to it.
Think before you buy.

Understand that Catholicism differs from other denominations in practice and belief.
Come a few minutes early.
You may see genuflecting (bending on the right knee), or bowing if their knees are bad, in the direction of the altar (the table up front).
Feel free to sit anywhere in the pews.
Look for a board somewhere towards the front that has numbers on it.
In the pews in front of you, you might see several books.
Once the Mass starts, breathe, sit back, and enjoy; this is not a stressful process.
At one point, the priest usually says, “Let us offer one another a sign of God’s peace.” A typical sign of peace is a light handshake accompanied by the phrase “Peace be with you”.
Prepare for Communion.
Appreciate the beauty of the church.
Feel free to take a bulletin to read later, and to greet the priest after Mass.

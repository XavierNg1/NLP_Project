Fill the tub with warm water.
Get the child into a comfortable position in the tub.
Get their entire bodies submerged in water.
After the child is clean, rinse them off, and if their hair needs a scrub, get their hair about 3/4 wet, lather up and scrub with your fingertips.
Give their bodies a final rinse, have them pull out the plug, stand up, and dry themselves.

First things first, a hard shoe is like a tap dancing shoe, but it is a little more expensive and instead of metal it has fiber-glass or resin tips.
Apply some Vaseline to the inside edge of your hard shoe where your heel will be.
Walk around.Since your hard shoe is now on, walk up and down stairs, walk around the house, but do not walk outside, the concrete will ruin the leather sole.

Start doing hop two threes.Every Irish step dancer know what a hop two three is.
If your feet are starting to hurt, take a break and start rubbing the inside of your hard shoe.
After rubbing, apply some more Vaseline, and put your hard shoes back on, because it is time to do more exercises.
Hop, hop back, hop back two three four.
Bend your hard shoe in half and put it under the couch.
Once you have done everything here, try to dance.
Toe stand practice.

Wash your hair.
Apply a leave-in conditioner or setting lotion to the hair from roots to ends.This should improve the PH balance of the hair.
Consider applying a natural oil, such as argon, jojoba or Moroccan oil, to each section individually.
Part your hair into 2 or 4 sections.
Comb the first section on the bottom left side of your hair from roots to ends.
Comb each of the remaining sections individually.
Wrap the bottom left section around the base of your skull, right above your ear and around the top of your head.
Pin the wrapped section at the top with large alligator clips.You may need to add a pin to the hair at the nape of your neck or a few other places that feel loose; however, you should try to use as few clips or pins as you can, because they can crimp the hair.

,
Repeat the wrap with the bottom right section, wrapping it around the base of the skull, above the left ear and around the top of the head.
Wrap the top left section around the right side of the head, below the 2 previous wraps, or above them, if need be.
Wrap the top right section around the left side of the head.
Wrap a satin scarf around your wrapped hair before you go to bed.
Consider placing a pair of clean pantyhose over the scarf as you sleep.
Use a hooded hair dryer on low for 45 minutes to 1 hour while your head is wrapped.
Wait until the hair is completely dry to remove the wrap.
If you prefer to dry your hair later, leave the hair wrapped.
Do not remove the pantyhose and scarf immediately when you wake up.

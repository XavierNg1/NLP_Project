Learn your chords cleanly, without transitions, before trying to switch between them.
Loosen and relax your body into a comfortable, smooth playing position.
Always fret with the tips of your fingers, not the pads.
Keep your fingers as close to the back of the fret as possible.
Keep practicing to build strength and stamina.

You will need a media reader that can read your chosen analog media.
Be sure your media reader has an "audio out" port.
Now that you have a way of turning your kinetic audio into static, you'll need a way to get your audio data into your computer.
You have an out and you have an in; now to bring them together.
Put your desired media into your media reader, connect the audio out of the reader to the audio in of your computer via your cable.
Here's where software comes in.
Make sure whatever program you use has the port where you have all the hardware connected selected as your recording source.
Take your program of choice and be sure it's set up to record with a high sound quality.
Hit the record button on the computer, and then hit play on your media reader.
Wait for whatever you are recording to finish playing, then hit stop and save on your program.

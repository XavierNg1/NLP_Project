Consider carefully before adding more dogs to your household.
If you do decide that you can manage with an extra mouth to feed, train, and care for, then don't hesitate.
Introduce your new dog to the existing dog before bringing her home.
Know what to expect when dogs meet one another for the first time.
Keep things running smoothly and bond with each one of your dogs.
Prevent dominance shifts that throw humans beneath dogs in the pack.
Work towards letting your dogs spend time alone together.
Know the the signs of aggression.
Feed each dog in its own bowl, with plenty of space between them or even in separate crates or spaces/rooms if there are signs of aggression during feeding.
Give balanced attention, but reinforce the hierarchy.
Ensure that each dog has its own sleeping area.
Have fun with your multiple dog household.

Stand in front of a mirror to practice.
Hold your left hand out with the palm facing you.
Bend your left thumb back toward your body.
Bend your right thumb at a 90Â° angle and lay it on the side of your left hand so that the knuckles of your thumbs are touching.
Curl the index and middle fingers of your right hand over your thumb knuckles where they touch.
Slide your right thumb to the right, along the length of your left hand.
Practice this movement until it feels comfortable and fluid.

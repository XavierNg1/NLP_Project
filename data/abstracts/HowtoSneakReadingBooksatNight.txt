Get the supplies: a book and a flashlight, or just a Kindle.
Act natural, like you're going to sleep.
Quietly, get out your book/Kindle.
Don't read under the covers.
Look at the wall opposite your door.
When someone is within earshot or can see whether there is a light on in your room, just quietly close your book/Kindle and shove it (quietly) beneath your covers.
Maybe one time you'll get caught.
When you are done reading, put your book or Kindle under your pillow.

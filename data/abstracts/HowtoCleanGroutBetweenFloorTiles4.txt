Rent or purchase a steam cleaner.
Follow the manufacturer’s directions to assemble and fill the steam cleaner.
Fill the reservoir with clean water to the fill line according to the manual’s instructions.
Turn the steam cleaner on and allow it to heat up.
Move the cleaning brush back and forth over the grout.
Use a towel or mop to wipe up the excess moisture after cleaning.
NOTE: Steam cleaning will remove all grout sealant, so only use a steam cleaner if your grout is unsealed or if the sealant is old and you are ready to remove it.

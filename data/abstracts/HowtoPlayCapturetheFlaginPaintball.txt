Wear lots of clothing.
If you are a beginner,play in a park where the paintballs are yellow and green.Other paintballs like red or blue hurt even more when they hit you.
Make sure your gun has a plug and safety on when you aren't on field.You might shoot somebody if it isn't on safety.
Come up with a game plan.
If you get shot,raise your gun and hand to signal people that you are out.Stay away from the field to avoid being shot again.
Have somebody guard you while you get the flag.
If you have the flag,come back to base to enjoy a victory.

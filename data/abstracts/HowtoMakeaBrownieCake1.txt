Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C/Gas 4) and prepare your cake pan.
Melt the butter, sugar, and 6 ounces (175 grams) of chocolate in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over low heat.
Separate the egg yolks from the egg whites.
Whisk the yolks into the chocolate.
Add the flour, nuts (if using), and the rest of the chocolate.
Beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks, then fold them into the batter.
Pour the batter into the greased cake pan, and bake it for 35 to 40 minutes.
Let the cake cool a little before removing it from the pan.
Serve the cake.

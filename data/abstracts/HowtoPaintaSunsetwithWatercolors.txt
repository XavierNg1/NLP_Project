Place the watercolor paper on a clean surface, ready for painting.
Gather together the watercolors you will be using for the project.
Start by lightly drawing a line in the middle of the watercolor paper.
Quickly paint lemon yellow (or yellow) lines on the dampened upper half of the paper.
Before the paint dries, paint lines using Cadmium Red (or red), Windsor Orange (or orange), and Rose Madder Genuine (or pink).
Using the half-line on the paper as a starting point, begin painting the hills in the background.
Paint the lake.
Done.

Let the young horse see new sights.
Dress your horse in soft blankets or parts of the harness.
Bit the horse as you would when breaking for saddle but use a driving bit.
Walk him around in the harness for a while to get used to it.
Lunge the horse in the harness and practice giving him voice commands to "walk", "trot", and "whoa".
Attach long reins or lines to the horse's bit and begin to "ground drive" him.
Ground drive the horse until you are confident that he understands what you want him to do.
Spend some time letting your horse get used to the cart for added safety.
With the help of a friend or two, one day quietly hitch the horse to the cart.
Step into the cart while your horse pulls it.
Repeat until both you and your horse are confident with this arrangement.
Keep these lessons short and interesting.

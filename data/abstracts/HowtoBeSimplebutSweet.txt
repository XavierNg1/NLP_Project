First, ensure that you are physically sweet.
How you dress does not really matter so much.
Treasure the friends that you have.
Be nice to everyone!,
Be polite and use good manners.
Join a volunteer organization.
Since the #1 quality of being sweet is caring about others, and trying to help them:


Stop using a search engine like Google and use one like benelab.org that donates 100% of the proceeds to charity.
Do well in school.
Don't swear.
Do not drink alcohol until you are of the legal drinking age, and then only in moderation.
Be fit.
Don't sweat the small stuff.
Pray and go to church/temple/etc.
Listen to your parents.

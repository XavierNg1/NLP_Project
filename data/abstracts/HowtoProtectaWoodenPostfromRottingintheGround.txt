Regardless of whether you're using the post for a fence or a mailbox, remember that water is the enemy.
Treat the wood for wood boring insects common to your area (ie termites, powder post beetles, carpenter ants...).
Using a good wood may help prolong the problem, though it will still eventually rot out if not set in concrete and moisture gets to it.
If you don't feel comfortable pouring cement, are unable to use insecticides, and can't find a wood you feel confident in, you may consider using a metal post instead.

Consider how the beans are roasted.
Splurge a little and buy yourself a bag or can of lily or Segafredo coffee.
Try organic coffee.
Do not be afraid to buy espresso roast or espresso grinds for brewed coffee.
Try to avoid buying coffee from grocery stores as even higher end coffee may sit on the shelf for months at a time and even air sealing will not prevent the flavor of the coffee from deteriorating.
Consider buying Fair Trade or Direct Trade coffee.
Try using shade grown coffee.

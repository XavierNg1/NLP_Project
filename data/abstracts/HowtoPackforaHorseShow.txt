Pack all of your tack the day before.
After you've packed up your tack, next you'll need to pack your grooming kit.
After you've finished packing up your tack and grooming kit, you'll need to pack all of your stable, feed and shipping items.
Now that you've packed your feed, stable, and shipping items, you'll want to make sure to pack the supplies you'll need for yourself in the show.

Black Dressage Coat
White, Long-Sleeve Rat-catcher Shirt
White Gloves
White Full-Seat Breeches
Black Belt
Black Dress Boots

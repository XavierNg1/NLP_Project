Prepare an "elevator speech".
Ask them what they think UU is.
Tell them about the Seven Principles.
Tell them a bit of history.
If you've taken it, explain the "Building Your Own Theology" or "Five Questions" course.
Let them know that many of us came to UU from other religious traditions.
Talk about how we've learned to tolerate the widely diverse beliefs that we have, and how that leads us not to discount or condemn other religious traditions.

,
If you're an atheist, and the other person knows that, explain how UU still helps you answer The Big Questions Of Life.

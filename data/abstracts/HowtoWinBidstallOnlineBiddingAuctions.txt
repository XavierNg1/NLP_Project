Play in all possible auctions: The first rule is to participate in all auctions one at a time weather or not you need the product.
Place bids early: When you place bids early, your chances of getting a position highly increase and you spend less in the process.
Create Gaps: As the auction progresses, more bidders join the fun, and many think the winning bid will be far away from the maximum price.
Bid for fixed value: Conventionally it’s seen that participants, who bid at Bidstall, end up winning when their bidding amount is about 30-40% of the product.
Heavy bidding: While this strategy is recommended for bidders with high risk appetite, it’s not a bad strategy either.
Finally remember, there is no free lunch anywhere, there never will be.

Find a good location.
Don't dig your pit right next to the jumps, dig them in between the jumps.
Make sure you have either a steep hill or adequate space to pedal up to speed, and then start your first jump.
Start a second pile for the landing ramp.
Start shaping.
Know what you're trying to build.
Make more than one jump in a row so you don't have to keep doing the same jumps over and over again.
Resist the temptation to ride the jump the day you built it.
Test each jump in a line before building the next one, so you know how much speed you will carry into the next jump, before you actually build it.
Cement your jumps.
Find a nice flat area;
,
Find some logs or sticks sticks preferably 15cm-25cm and stack them in a pile the shape of a jump


(note: beginners make in small and low only about 50 cm high)

,Get a lot of dirt and cover the main area of the jump and if wanted make small slopes off the sides

,
Get a fair amount of water (remember water restrictions!)

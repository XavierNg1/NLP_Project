Find a good song that fits the story you are thinking about using in the AMV.
Watch the episodes which can relate, for a couple of times and try to read out the story to get a better understanding.
Try using songs that are more action type.

Now comes the time to edit the AMV.
If you are a person who shows quality editing instead of story, it may be easier for you to go pick up any random clips from the show and play a song, but make sure the song would fit a random situation.After finishing the AMV, you want to make sure that you render them in good settings, in Sony Vegas, recommended settings are "HDV 720-30p (1280x720, 29.970 fps)"under the Project Properties settings and keep to "6 Mbps HD 720-30p Video" in the Template when you finally go to render your project.
After rendering, watch your work a few times before publishing it online, there are many great websites such as YouTube, Vimeo and AnimeMusicVideo.org too.
Don't be afraid taking your work to next level.
(Optional).
Render again in HD and enjoy your finished product.Upload your video on YouTube or any other website, in this case, you upload your Shot In The Dark AMV on YouTube and it will appear similar to the video below.

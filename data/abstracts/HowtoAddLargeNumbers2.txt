Write any two or more numbers in a column, of at least 2 digits.
Add multiple numbers by placing them in vertical columns, then writing the resulting sums vertically beneath the line.For example, to add 4357 to 3212 involves adding 4 thousand to 3 thousand (7,000), 3 hundred to 2 hundred (500), 5 tens to 1 ten (60), and 7 ones to 2 ones (9).
Work more complex problems by repeating these steps, not changing them.
Add three or more numbers using this method by simply repeating the process.

Store art materials out of reach when they're not in use.
Emphasize that all artwork is done on paper (or other approved medium) not on other things.
Provide other outlets for creativity, as long as your child is old enough to distinguish between places where artwork is encouraged and places where artwork is not allowed.
Make a wall just for drawing on.
Teach the toddler to write on paper.

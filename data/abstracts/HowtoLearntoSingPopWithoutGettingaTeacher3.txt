Warm-up before singing, always.
Open your mouth wide for notes in the low register.
Lift your cheeks and push from the throat and nose to hit higher notes in the register.
"Belt out" big notes by building strength and comfort in the high register.
Consider learning a piano or guitar to accompany yourself, or join a band.

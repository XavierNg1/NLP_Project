Slid your bobby pin(s) partway onto an index card.Leave about Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters) sticking out over the edge.
Make sure that the side you want to decorate is facing up.
Choose something to glue to your bobby pin.
Place a drop of glue onto the back of the gem.The best glue to use for this would be an industrial-strength glue, super glue, or epoxy glue.
Press the gemstone onto the bobby pin.It would be best if you pres it against the flat/bumpy side, and not the curved/looped part of the bobby pin.
Wait for the glue to dry.
Take the bobby pin off the paper.

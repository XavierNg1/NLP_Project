Work together as a team.
Sit down and write out your schedule on paper.
Ask for hours or shifts that work for both of you.
Ask for help.
Accept that both of you need to make room for uninterrupted sleep.
Maintain a positive outlook.
Keep in touch.
Spend as much time with the baby yourself after work.
Thank each other.

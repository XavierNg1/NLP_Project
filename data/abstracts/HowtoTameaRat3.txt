Unsocialized rats are absolutely terrified of people and are usually very difficult to hold or even touch.
Get your rats hooked on a treat, and teach them to take it from your hand, as directed above for semi-socialized rats.
Start making them come to the door of the cage in order to get a treat.
Lure them out of the cage.
Once your rats have reached a certain comfort level with you (skittish yet exploring you freely and willing to eat out of your lap), you should start interacting with them.

Plant heather in sandy loam soil that contains organic matter.
Test the soil to make sure it has an acidic pH of 6.1 to 6.8.
Adjust the soil pH if it is at 6.0 or lower or above 6.8.
Use a thin metal rod to determine the depth of the wet soil.
Give the heather two inches of water every week.
Donâ€™t worry about fertilizing your heather plant.
Prune the heather in the fall after it finishes flowering.

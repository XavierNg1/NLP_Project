Create a blueprint on paper of the layout of your house, room by room, floor by floor.
Make sure the buyer is able to easily identify which floor of the house they are viewing, or you will have lost their attention.
Label each of the rooms that you drew on your blueprint.
Use a colored marker to draw a line from your front door through the house and into the 1st room the buyer would go into and then continuously into the next room and so on into each and every room.
Create a pathway to follow in taking your pictures.
Consider the few more factors.
Use these abbreviations or make up your own and label each room on your blueprint (as long as they’re easily identifiable to the buyer).
Take the pictures outside of your house.
Take the pictures inside of your house.
Consider a fact that there are 3 concerns a buyer has in making the decision to buy a house which is the most expensive purchase of his life, in this order:


Emotional concerns – the context, and feelings about living in it
Practical considerations – the content, number of rooms, schools, etc.
After each picture is taken, put a check mark in that room and do take pictures of corridors and passageways leading from one room to another, in sequence with the flow of the rooms, from one to another.

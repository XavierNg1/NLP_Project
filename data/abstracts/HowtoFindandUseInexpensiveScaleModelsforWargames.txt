Decide where you are going to play the game.
Resolve not to be worried by the phrase "Toy Soldiers".
Go to a toy store and look at what they have.
A simple example is the American Civil War, for which is is fairly easy to find a useful range of figures for both sides.
For each side you need to organise the figures into units, and it helps to glue groups of models to card bases.
For the battleground, you have a table with a hill in the middle; this could be made from a few magazines, and looks best when covered by a green cloth.
Movement: The bases of a unit must start and end each move in contact with each other.
Firing: All the bases of a unit must fire at the same enemy unit, which must be within range and visible.
Fighting: If 2 bases end the turn In Contact (within 1 inch of each other) they Fight.
Morale: Most battles are decided by soldiers running away, rather than by being killed.

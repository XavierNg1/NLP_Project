Jump!,
Find high ground or any elevated area which over looks the map.
Use the terrain and map to your advantage.
Aim at your opponent's feet.
Throw grenades, especially if you are reloading and your enemy has no shields.
Learn when to fire and what scope to use.
Stand away from walls - normally a rocket fired straight at you will fly past, but the wall will explode the rocket on impact and thus kill you.
Keep moving - don't be tempted to camp in any one spot, even if it is an elevated position or well fortified structure.
Take advantage of the situation, such as when there is a large group of people jumping around.
Find a secret hiding spot, if you must.

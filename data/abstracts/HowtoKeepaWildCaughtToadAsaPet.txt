Keep a pile of chopped wood in your backyard because those harbor many insects and will draw in toads.
Go outside just before dark when everything is damp.
Look for toads by turning over logs and rocks, as well as checking around corners of houses outdoors.
Act fast when you locate the toad!,
Swoop down upon the toad with your net.
Pick up the net and make a twist near the top so the toad can hop around but cannot escape.

,
Gently put the toad inside your container (Make sure that there are plenty of air holes so your new pet can breathe!),
Carry the toad back to your house.
Prepare the toad's tank.
Cover the bottom of the tank with 3 inches (7.6Â cm) of soil from the area where you caught the toad.
Sink in a water dish designed for small reptiles about half a toad deep, 2 toads wide, and 4 toads long.
Take a rock, ensuring it is not too heavy and unbalanced or a purchased hide from a reptile store and prop it up against the side of the tank for a nice hiding place.
Take a very small flowerpot (about 4 inches across, 7 inches high).
Place the toad inside the tank gently.
Use a plant mister to mist all around the tank when the dirt gets dry.
Add a water dish to the housing.
Feed your new toad every other day.
Add the toad's food in one spot of the cage only.
Beware of any change in their eating habits.
Provide plenty of hiding spaces.
Do not hold the toad often.

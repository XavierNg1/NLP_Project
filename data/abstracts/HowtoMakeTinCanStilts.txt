Measure your equipment to see if it is the right size.
Punch a hole on each side of the unopened ends of the cans.
Take the nail out.
Wrap a piece of paper around the can.
Decorate the paper and stick it on both cans.
Thread a string through the holes in each can.
Tie a knot on each string so it wonâ€™t pull through.
Have fun with them.
Finished.

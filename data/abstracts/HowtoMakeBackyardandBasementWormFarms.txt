Remember that worms ARE living creatures, and thus they ingest, digest, secrete and excrete, the four basic living routines, and elemental functions of life in itself.
Decide what you want to make your worm bins from, and if they will last, and where you live and the climate also factor in on what you should build the bins you plan on using.
Mix your bedding together; just about anything organic works.
Add a mix of wet shredded paper with clay, silt and sand, and some untreated wood sawdust or peat moss or bark chips, and if you want to, add a heaping helping of wet, but cured grass, hay, or rye straw soaked in water to your cleaned, rinsed, and sanitized 5 gallon (18.9Â L) tubs, wooden bins or flat plastic tubs.
Use a masons trowel to stir and add all the forms of bedding you want to use.
Add your worms.
Feed them, feed them often, and watch them grow!,
Make sure that your bins have adequate ventilation!,
Beware of pests.
Every 3 weeks or so, empty your small bins by hand, using rubber or vinyl gloves, and see how the development is going.

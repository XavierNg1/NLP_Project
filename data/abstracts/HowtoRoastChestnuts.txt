Pre-heat the oven to 400ºF (205ºC) or fire up the Grill.
Carefully cut an X into the flat side of each nut with a sharp, pointy knife, cutting through the shell.
Spread the nuts on a rimmed baking sheet for the oven or directly on the grill, cut side up.
Roast for 15 to 20 minutes or until they're tender and the shell comes off easily.
Wrap the hot chestnuts in a towel and squeeze them to crush the skins.
Peel while nuts are warm.
Enjoy!

Start your research early.
Consult mock drafts.
Keep a close eye on the IR.
Know your league.
Draft using the points system.
Never take a kicker before round 9, and probably not before the last 2 rounds.
Pay attention to BYE weeks.
Don't draft all of your favorite players from your favorite team.
Don't forget about 'handcuff players'.

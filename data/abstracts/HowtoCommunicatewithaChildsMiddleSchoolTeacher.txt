Ask yourself why you need to see the teacher.
If you consider the meeting is still needed, canvass the following:


Will talking with my child's teacher embarrass my child or make them feel insecure?,
Think about how your child would react to you telling them.
Establish communication with your child's teacher.
Choose a mutually convenient time to meet.
Share your concerns with your spouse.
Have some idea of what you're going to be talking about with the teacher by now.
Be prepared to listen as well as talk.
Stay in touch for follow-ups.

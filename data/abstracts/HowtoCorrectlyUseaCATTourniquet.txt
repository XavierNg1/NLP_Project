Only apply a CAT on wounds on the arms and legs.
Ask someone at the scene to call Emergency Medical Services.
Wash your hands thoroughly with antibacterial soap and clean water.
Prepare the necessary materials.
Open the sterile dressing package.
Explain the procedure to the injured person.
Put the sterile gloves on.
Use the scissors to cut around any of the person’s clothing to expose the wound.
Take the sterile dressing or clean cloth and apply direct, firm pressure to the wound for five minutes.
After five minutes of continuous pressure, assess the wound.
Prepare to use a CAT if the wound is still bleeding.
Instruct the injured person to take deep and slow breaths as you apply the CAT.
Wrap the tourniquet at least 2 inches above the wound.
Pass the tip of the CAT into the slit of the buckle and pull it tightly.
Twist the rod in either direction until the bleeding stops.
Place the rod inside the clip of the tourniquet to secure it.
Call for help immediately or check to make sure EMS is on its way.
Loosen the tourniquet once EMS arrives at the scene or if the person indicates they are in severe pain.
Be aware of how a tourniquet works.
Only use a CAT if there is heavy bleeding from a wound or life threatening injuries.
For slight injuries or bleeding, apply pressure to the wound and a bandage before using a tourniquet.
Always remove the tourniquet if it has been on the wound for more than two hours.
Understand that CATs are painful to apply.
Use cheaper, alternative material if you don’t have access or can’t afford a CAT.
Practice using a CAT on yourself.

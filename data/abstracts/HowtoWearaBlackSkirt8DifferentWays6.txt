Tie a black belt or sash around the blouse at your natural waist, just below your bust.
Wear nude nylon stockings if the occasion demands it.
Wear trendy heels that you feel comfortable walking around in.
Stick with a few key pieces of jewelry, but do not overwhelm your outfit with too many extravagant pieces.
Carry a large but simple shoulder bag.

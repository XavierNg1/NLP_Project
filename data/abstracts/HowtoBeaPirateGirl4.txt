Have a pirate personality and have pirate hobbies to complement your pirate looks.
Strut like you are absolutely arrogant but not too popular.
Gesture a lot, and talk with your hands.
Talk like a pirate!

Be proud, be strong, an' flaunt your pirattitude!,
Never never hit, kick, or insult the ones you love.
Do NOT go overboard or youâ€™ll get wet.

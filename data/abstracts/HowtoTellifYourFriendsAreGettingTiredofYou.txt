Determine if your friends are ignoring you.
Be aware of mean stuff they might be saying.
Consider whether something obvious has happened recently.
Listen up.
Are they constantly making excuses to get away, such as "I don't feel good", all the time?,
Be realistic.
Watch out for if they call you nasty names then pretend it was only a joke or if they talk about you behind your back then ignore it.
Talk to your friends.
Invite your friends over for some fun time together.
Move on.

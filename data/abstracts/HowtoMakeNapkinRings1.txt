Cut an empty toilet paper roll into thirds.You can also use a paper towel roll instead; in that case, cut the roll into rings as thin or as thick as you'd like.
Hot glue the end of a long piece of jute string inside the cut toilet paper roll.
Start wrapping the jute string around the cut toilet paper ring.
Continue wrapping until the entire ring is covered, then glue the end of the string inside the napkin ring.
Hot glue a rustic or natural decoration onto the top of the napkin ring.
Let the glue set before using your napkin ring.

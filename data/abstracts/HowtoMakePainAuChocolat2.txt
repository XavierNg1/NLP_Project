Cut the butter into small diced cubes.
Proof the yeast by mixing together the yeast, lukewarm water and pinch of sugar.
In a large bowl, or in the bowl of your food processor, mix together the flour, 1/3 cup sugar and salt.
In a separate bowl, mix together the proofed yeast, beaten eggs, and milk or cream.
Put the bowl in the refrigerator, and let it rest for about 10 minutes.

Take out the bowl, and turn the dough out onto a floured surface.
Put the kneaded dough into a clean bowl.
Punch down the dough ball, and put the ball into a plastic bag that's big enough to allow the ball to expand to at least three times its original size.
About 90 minutes before you want to bake the bread, take the dough out and shape and fill it as you wish.
Seal it closed.

,
Shape it into a ring.

,
After you've shaped the dough to your liking, place it on a parchment or silicon pad lined baking sheet.
Brush the top of the dough with an egg wash (a mixture of beaten egg and a little milk).

,
Bake for about 45 to 50 minutes - a longer time if you are baking 2 at once, shorter if you have a convection oven.
Take out, let cool, and enjoy.

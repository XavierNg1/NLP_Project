Run your rope around the thing you wish to tie your knot around.
Form a loop with the running end.
Pull the tip of the running end so that it goes around the standing end.
Pull the tip of the running end up through the loop you made previously.
Pull the tip back through the hole.
Pull on the standing end to secure the knot.
Once the knot is flush against the pole, pulling on the standing end will make the knot tighter.

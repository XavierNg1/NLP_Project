Depending on whether your flushometer is facing left or right, there should be a slot for a flat screwdriver on either side.
Take a wrench and screw the top lid of the flushometer off.
Take the flange cover off.
You will now see a gasket, which will have a lot of sediment.
Take out and clean the gasket, including the weep hole.Follow steps 1 to 5 in reverse order (skipping the cleaning part, as you have already cleaned) to get the toilet working again, leaving it good as new.If this solution didn't work, you will need to replace the gasket.

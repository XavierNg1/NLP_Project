If you and your partner want to watch a movie, make sure that the children will not be disturbed.
If you'd like to share a dance with your partner, find a suitable space in your apartment and put on some music you enjoy.
If you want to run a bubble bath for both of you, try to use a bathroom not directly adjacent to your children's bedroom.
If you intend to make out or indulge in other amorous activities, do so in a place that your children will not accidentally walk in on.

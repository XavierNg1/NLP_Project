Take two shoe boxes.
Punch paired holes in the boxes.
Take a strand of yarn and thread it through two of the holes that line up together.
Cut out two pieces of cardboard that are the same size as the short end of the boxes.
Cut off the edge of the smaller box so that it's shaped like a triangle.
Repeat the last step, but make it a bit different.
Decorate the house.
Make a door on the top floor, to where it goes outside of the house.
Repeat with the other room next to the room you just used.
Make all the windows, doors, and rooms.
You're all done––let Twilight explore her new home!

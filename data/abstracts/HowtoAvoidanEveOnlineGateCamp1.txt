Make sure you have a fast ship.
If you are in a fleet situation, send a scout over into a gate before the rest of the fleet.
If you are escorting a slower ship, you will want to have as many heavily armed battle cruisers and battleships protecting it as possible.
If you get trapped in a gate camp while leaving a system make a dash for the gate.
Warp core stabs are only useful if you have a very large amount of them.
Destroying the mobile warp disruptor is an option in fleets.
If you have a cloaking ship, like Covert Ops, you can easily escape a camp with no bubble.

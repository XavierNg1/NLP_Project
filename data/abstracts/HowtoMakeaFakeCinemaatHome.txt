Make a list of things you need.
Make tickets and sell them for a certain price (not like in a real cinema because you will end up with no one) after you've sold some tickets you will know how many people are coming.

,
Set up the play area.
Make or download a film.
Make sure you've done everything before the guests have came!

,
Enjoy your cinema!

Mound rocks and logs in two piles and add dirt on top of it about as high as your skill level (2-3 feet for beginners and 5-9 feet for experts, the gap (if you feel like you are certain to crash, do a jump instead) needs to be 2–5 feet (0.6–1.5 m) for beginners and 8–15 feet (2.4–4.6 m) for experts).
Compact the ramps down by hitting them with a flat spade or stamping on them.
Add water to the dirt jump so it doesn't become dusty and break apart in clumps, and so it's easier to pack down.
Make multiple jumps in a row, also known as a rhythm section.
Focus on a set up that flows.

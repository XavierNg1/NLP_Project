Eat a variety of foods.
Include sources of calcium, vitamin B-12, and vitamin D.

Calcium is important for strong teeth and bones, so if your diet allows, incorporate milk or low-fat dairy products into your daily diet.
Be sure to get enough iron, protein, and Omega-3 fatty acids.
Visit a health professional or dietician at least once per year.

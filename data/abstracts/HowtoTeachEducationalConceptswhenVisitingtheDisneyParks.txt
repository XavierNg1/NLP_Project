Be ready to research the subject matter that the ride depicts.
Research what rides at each of the parks you'll be visiting have any educational value.
Keep an open mind and be willing to accept that rides do change over time, and that you might be having to add or subtract rides from your "must teach" list.

,
Preview the rides in real-time yourself.
Ride the ride one more time with your kids in tow.
Give the kids a wide variety of places that they can get taught the values in an educational standpoint.

,
Let your kids have a say, and make them explain how one ride educational concept can compare to another ride's same educational concept without much help.

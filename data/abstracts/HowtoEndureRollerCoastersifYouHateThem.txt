Try not to look at a ride beforehand.
Think positive thoughts.
Don't hesitate when getting on.
Don't cry or mention your fear.
Sit by your family/friends if possible.
Relax when the ride begins to move (unless it is an extremely fast roller coaster, such as Stealth, Speed, Rita, Formula Rossa, etc where it may be impossible to do so).
Keep your eyes open.
Take your time to appreciate things.
Don't try to hate every second, try to love it.
If the ride ends and you didn't enjoy it, you don't have to go back on.

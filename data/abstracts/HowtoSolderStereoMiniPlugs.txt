Strip the two insulated wires and twist the shielding into a third "wire.",
Slip the case over the wire.

,
Tin the wire with solder (heat it up and coat it).
Slightly scratch the connectors on the back of the plug so that the solder will go on easier This way, they are super clean, and the solder will flow on nicely.
Join the common, then join the left and right.
Put some tape around each connection to insulate them.
Screw it all together.
Test the finished product to ensure that each of the three sections on the front of the plug have not somehow become connected to another section by a short circuit.

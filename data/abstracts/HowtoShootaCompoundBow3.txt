Clip the release that you attached to your wrist at the beginning onto the string loop and directly behind the arrow.
Pull back on the string with the release slowly using your back and shoulder muscles.
Continue to pull the string back until the tip of the arrow almost reaches your chin.
Aim the bow at your target using the sight system built into the compound bow.
Squeeze the trigger of the release with your pointer finger to shoot the arrow.

Take the time to take it in.
Decide whether this changes things only for you, or if it will change a relationship(s).
Seek guidance and counsel.
Seriously meditate on all possible consequences of your actions.
Ask yourself what payoff you are looking for, especially if your actions will create a sensation or a big blowup.
Take a deep breath... and do it.
Move forward.

Choose a suitable tube.
Cut a 6" length of this tube.
Choose a balloon that's a tight fit on the tube without having to cut the neck from it and slowly work it onto the cardboard tube, gripping it with your fingers and going around the tube to slide it on evenly.
Projectile: To load the sling-shot drop a BB or small stone into the tube and into the balloon.
Hold the cardboard tube with one hand.

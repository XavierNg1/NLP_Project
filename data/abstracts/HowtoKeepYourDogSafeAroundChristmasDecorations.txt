Train your dog how to drop, let go and stay away from objects.
Reward compliance with the command with treats.
Avoid exciting her attention.
Arrange fragile ornaments securely and out of the way.
If your dog likes to chew paper, place wrapped gifts around the tree just before it's time to give them.
For yard decorations, try staking the wire frames of animal and other display items into the ground with ordinary tent stakes.
Choose decorations with care.
Last but not least, relax and enjoy the holidays.

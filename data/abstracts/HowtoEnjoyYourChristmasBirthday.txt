Accept that your birthday is competing with an important festive occasion.
Look on the bright side.
Talk to your parents, spouse, housemates or whoever else is responsible for throwing you a party.
Put up birthday decorations as well as Christmas ones.
Be appreciative of what you receive by way of gifts.
Go online and commiserate with other Christmas Day babies.
See if you can celebrate a "half-birthday" in six months time instead.

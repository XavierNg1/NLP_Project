Determine which form of quadratic equation you have.
Define your variables.
Calculate h. In vertex form equations, your value for h is already given, but in standard form equations, it must be calculated.
Calculate k. As with h, k is already known in vertex form equations.
Plot your vertex.
Draw the parabola's axis (optional).
Find the direction of opening.
If necessary, find and plot x intercepts.
If necessary, find and plot the y intercept.
If necessary, plot additional points, then graph.

Next, extend the legs on your bass drum spurs so that the front hoop is about an inch off the ground, placing the drum with the spurs 4–6 inches (10.2–15.2 cm) from the outer edge of the carpet or drum riser.
Attach the bass drum pedal - and slave pedal if you play double kick.
Your snare should be set relatively flat, placed right between your legs, and high enough that your hands don't bang into your thighs when you rim shot (don't re-read that sentence too many times).

Your mounted toms (any number is acceptable, but typically you'll have 1,2, or 3 mounted toms.),
Your floor tom should be next to your bass drum leg, opposite your snare with approximately the same height and angle as the snare.
If you play a double pedal, place your hi-hat stand right next to the slave pedal, and you should find that it's already in a comfortable place for you.
Your crash cymbal is usually placed in between the 1st mounted tom and the hi-hat.
The ride cymbal is generally placed over the floor tom.
Just keep in mind the idea of "ergonomics when placing the ride.

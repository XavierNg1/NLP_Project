Take the time to sit down with your sibling and have a serious chat about the situation that is currently going on.
Ask your sibling what strong areas he/she thinks are found in your relationship (ex: you both are good at sharing).
After the positive points have been made, ask your sibling what areas you could improve in your life to help strengthen the bond between you two.
Once your sibling has listed some improvements that you could make, it's your turn to let your sibling know what he/she needs to improve in as well.
Have the two of you pick two or three areas to work on together (ex: sharing and doing the chores).
Make it you and your sibling's goal to work hard in strengthening those areas.
Once you both feel that the area(s) you've been working on are strong enough, focus on other areas while maintaining the strong areas to make them even stronger.

If matters are worse, ask your parents for advice and see what they can do to help strengthen the relationship between you and your sibling.

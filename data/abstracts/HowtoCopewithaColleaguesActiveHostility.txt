DO NOT REACT ANGRILY.
Think about why this person is gossiping about you.
Work out old grudges with the gossip-monger.
Approach your boss.
Ask that the gossip-monger be dealt with firmly.
There will follow a period of days, weeks or even months when people who listened, or are still listening, to the gossip against you will avoid you completely.
During this difficult period, keep a low profile.
Pay attention to your attendance and be at your workplace at or before the start of working hours.
Don't let yourself slip into a depression.
Pay attention to what you eat.
Wait patiently for results.
Meanwhile, ensure that your colleagues always see you at your best: cool, calm, smiling, helpful, efficient, humble, honest and sincere.
Know that you've won the silent war as bosses and colleagues begin interacting with you normally after a short hiatus, and show you that they like and trust you.

Congratulate yourself.

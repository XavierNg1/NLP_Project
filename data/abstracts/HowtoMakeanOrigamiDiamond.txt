Get out a 6" by 6" piece of paper.
Fold the paper from left to right or right to left.
Fold the paper again, but this time from top to bottom, or bottom to top.
Flip the paper.
Make another diagonal fold, this time bringing the bottom left corner of the paper to the top right corner of the paper.
Make sure your paper is now split into triangles.
Once you have found this line, you should also find a line going up and down, splitting the line in half, so there should be a left part and a right part to the horizontal line.
Identify the two triangles on your paper.
Notice that the paper has two flaps.
Flip the paper over, then repeat the previous step.
Find the two parts of the diamond (not including the flaps).
Fold the left part of the first part of this diamond to meet the center of the diamond.

,
Flip the paper over, and repeat the last two steps.
Flip the "diamond" upside down and notice the two pockets on each side of the "diamond".
Flip the paper over, then repeat the previous step again.

,
Blow gently into the bottom of the diamond, extending the top.
Finished.

Find your anime festival/ anime con that you would want to go.
Visit the Anime Festival site.
Decide what Anime character you want to be.
If your Festival/ con lets you bring water, bring a water bottle, if you can, you can bring a bag if your con/fest does not provide you one to put the stuff you buy, but you should bring your own since you will need to bring stuff.
If you live far away,etc, you can always rent the hotel or apartment close to it or the building it is in.

,
Remember the day before you go, get some good sleep.
When you go, if they allow you to bring a camera, take pictures with it.
Have fun.
Don't give out your contact information.
Finished.

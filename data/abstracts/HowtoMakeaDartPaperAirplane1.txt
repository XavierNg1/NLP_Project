Start with a standard letter-sized piece of paper that measures 8 1/2 inches by 11 inches (A4, printer paper).
Fold the whole piece of paper in half lengthwise.
Crease the paper down the middle and then open the piece of paper back up.
Fold the top corners down and in toward the center crease, so that what used to be the top edge lines up with the center crease.
Grab each edge that comes off of the top point, basically the creases you made in the previous step.
Refold your paper airplane along the center line.
Lay the paper airplane down on your work surface.
Take the long edge of one side and fold it over so the whole edge runs along the center crease.
Open up both of these last creases halfway, so that the long edges furthest from the center crease form two wings.
Grab your paper airplane along the bottom crease and throw it!

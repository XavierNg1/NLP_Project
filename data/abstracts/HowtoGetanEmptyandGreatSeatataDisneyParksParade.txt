Visit the Disney Park that the parade will be shown in.
Pick up a brochure (that contains the park map of your language) upon entry.
Look for the parade route on the park map.
Look at the Times Guide brochure for the parade times.
Stake out some of the viewing locations for the one parade.
Look for key signs that a parade might be taking place within the right area.
Look for spaces to the left and right of the park benches, if the benches themselves are filled up seconds after the last parade moves forward from the point of the pole-bearer ("The End" bar and sign) forward.

,
Try to always arrive at these benches at least two hours before the second parade comes through, and don't ever leave the space unmanned unless another credible person in your party can honestly save you your seat.

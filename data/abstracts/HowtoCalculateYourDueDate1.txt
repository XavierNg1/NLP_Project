Determine the date of your last menstrual period (LMP) before you found out you were pregnant.
Add 40 weeks from that date to determine the due date.
Alternately, remember Naegele's Rule.
Choose other methods to calculate your due date if you cannot remember the date of your LMP or have irregular periods.

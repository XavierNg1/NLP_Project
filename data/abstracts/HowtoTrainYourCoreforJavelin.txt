Improve your core musculature.
Javelin throwers can train their core to support their backs, to speed up their hips dramatically and even to give them more speed during their run-up but most importantly, javelin throwers can avoid weakest link syndrome by strengthening their core allowing them to make use of all of their body's power for massive throws!

Proper core training stabilizes your entire back during a javelin throw.
Increase your hip power.
Improve your approach.
Take an objective look at your core.Make sure your core isn’t your weakest link to avoid weakest link syndrome.

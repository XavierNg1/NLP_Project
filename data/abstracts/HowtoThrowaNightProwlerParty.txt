Think about the friend's house you'll be sleeping over at.
Make an escape plan.
Go to the host's room and whisper about the plan.
Make sure the parents are asleep, and start putting on your clothes, as if you were getting ready for school.
Once out, you run the night.
Go home after 2 hours, but you can go out again about 2 hours after you came home if you get bored.

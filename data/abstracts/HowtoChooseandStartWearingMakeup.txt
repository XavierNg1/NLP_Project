Try to figure out what kind of skin tone you have.
If you have a warm skin tone, you look better in jewel tones, reds, blues, purples etc.
If you have a cool skin tone, you look better in earthy tones, browns, greens, golds etc.
Once you've figured out your skin tone, try to find makeup in these tones.
Start with something basic, and natural, for example, some mascara, a little eyeliner, and lip gloss.
Once you feel confident pulling off an easy look, try to get more advanced, and buy concealer, setting powder and foundation.
Look up video tutorials of more difficult looks, or figure them out yourself, so that eventually you'll be able to do your own glam looks for parties.

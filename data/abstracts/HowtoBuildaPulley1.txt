Round up the necessary supplies.
Cut the wire hanger at the bottom, right in the middle.
Thread the open ends of the wire through the spool.
Close off the wire hanger so that the spool stays in place.
Loop the string over the top of the pulley.
Hang the pulley system up, making sure it can spin freely.
Tie the weight to one end of the string, Pulley's make your work easier by distributing the weight and forces across the "different" sides of strings created by the pulley.
Pull down on one end of the rope to bring the weight up with ease.
Ask yourself some questions, adjusting the pulley to test your experiment.

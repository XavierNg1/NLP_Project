Disconnect the electricity and turn off the gas, since you will be moving the stove around.
Remove all the pieces you can remove from the stove – drip pans, racks, gas burners (do not do this with electric burners), knobs, and handles and take them outside (or the bathroom if you don’t have an outside area).
Find a good quality oven cleaner and don’t forget to buy a new set of rubber gloves.
After allowing the cleaner to sit for the recommended time, get a sponge and bucket of warm water.
Next day, prepare the bucket with more warm, soapy water (Simple Green).
Reassemble the stove and reconnect the power (and gas).
Finished.

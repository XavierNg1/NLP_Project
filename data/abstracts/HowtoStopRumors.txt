Don't play dumb.
Don't let them see how much you care.
Don't fight fire with fire.
Talk to an adult or authority figure if you have to.
Stand up for yourself.
Determine what lends credibility to the rumor, and stop it.
Prove that it's not true if you can.
Broadcast the rumor.
Confront the source.
Take care of yourself.

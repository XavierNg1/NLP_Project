Prepare at least a cup of grated Parmesan cheese.
Line the baking sheet with parchment paper.
Use a spoon to create a rounded teaspoon of cheese for each cracker.
Nudge any stray pieces of cheese onto a neighboring mound.
Place crackers in the oven to bake.
Remove the baking sheets from the oven.
Transfer the crackers to a container.

Put more cheese on cookie sheet if you are baking more––and why not make more?

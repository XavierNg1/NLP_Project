Don't buy stuff you don't need.
Buy things that will last.
Clean your room.
Shop the sales rack.
Use your gift cards in two different ways.
When shopping for clothes, don't buy the shirt that just got in for $25.00 plus, because you will soon see it on the clearance rack, selling for $5.00.

Save that pocket change!,
Never ever use the Coin Star Machine to convert change to dollar bills!,
Don't constantly be counting your money otherwise you will end up looking vain and spending it as soon as you find out you have more than ten dollars!

Don't buy stuff that you really don't need.

,
(This step for young teens only) Keep a set amount of money in your wallet, say 5-10 dollars, for emergencies or small novelties.
To really stop yourself from spending, use a money box that is not easily accessible, for example a piggy bank with no hatch so you have to smash it to obtain the money, or one of those tin can style boxes you have to use a can opener to access!

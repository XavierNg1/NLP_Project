Limit your cat’s outdoor time.When cats wander about outdoors — especially when they encounter strange cats or dogs — the likelihood that they will contract fleas or ticks increases.
Feed your pet supplements.Keeping your pet healthy with a well-balanced diet and good nutrition gives them healthy skin that could help control flea infestations.
Check your cat regularly for fleas and ticks.After your cat comes back inside, part their fur and look for small brown or black spots that could be bugs.

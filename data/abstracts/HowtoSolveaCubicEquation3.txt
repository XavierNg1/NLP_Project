Write out the values of a, b, c, and d. For this method of finding a cubic equation's solutions, we'll be dealing heavily with the coefficients of the terms in our equation.
Calculate Δ0 = b2 - 3ac.
Calculate Δ1= 2b3 - 9abc + 27a2d.
Calculate Δ = Δ12 - 4Δ03) ÷ -27a2.
Calculate C = 3√(√((Δ12 - 4Δ03) + Δ1)/ 2).
Calculate the three roots with your variables.

Buy a fresh new can of clear polyester casting resin.
Check the viscosity of the resin fluid.Set up in an open air area with plenty of ventilation and away from open flames.
Use safety googles, gloves, respirator and coveralls when casting with resins and chemicals.Protect all exposed working surfaces with plastic or drop cloth from spills.
Replace or clean airbrush nozzles immediately after use.
Mix small amounts of resin and catalyst at a time.
Read and understand the instructions before mixing and using resin.Use less catalyst than the recommended ratio on the chart because the foliage and petal tips could easily burn or get damaged.
Spray as lightly and gentle as you could.
Coat one thin coat at a time to reduce heat shock and faster curing time.Wait at least one hour between coats.Allow proper ventilation and space between each leaf and flower.Use a hair dryer in a low setting to help resin cure faster and dry excess resin.Wait at least 48 hours to move and handle your flowers to avoid leaving prints or deforming your flowers.

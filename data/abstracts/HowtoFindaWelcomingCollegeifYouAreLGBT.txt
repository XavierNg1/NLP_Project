Ignore college ranking lists, including and especially ones related to LGBT acceptance.
Disregard what colleges may say about being uniquely isolated from their surroundings and pay close attention to the area your potential school of choice is located in.
Don't take the brochure's word for its proclaimed LGBT friendly campus.
Do not by any means assume that because the student body of your school is more intelligent or accomplished than average that they will accept LGBT people or be welcoming.
Check that there is an LGBT organization at the college and see if you like the people in it or can get along with them.
Make sure your potential school has protections for LGBT students and/or a non-discrimination policy.
If your college has a religious affiliation, check that religion's stance on LGBT people.

Find a large unwanted doily.
Cover a bowl in plastic kitchen wrap, ensuring that it goes over the rim.
Choose between fabric stiffener or sugar water to stiffen the bowl.
Place the dipped, wet doily over the bowl.
Set aside in a warm, dry place.
Lift the bowl gently, using the kitchen plastic wrap to help lever it off the molding bowl.
Use.

Get a piano.
Get it somewhere that you can take it apart.
Look it all over.
The objective is to have a good looking prop that you can move.
Take off the top cover, the "knee board", and the front.
Lift out all the keys (you may want to put them back in if you want the piano to look like a piano later).
Take out any other obvious parts that keep you from getting close to the big "harp" in the back.

,
Do NOT unbolt the harp yet.
Remove the rear sound board and harp by taking all the bolts out (about an hour) and sliding it up behind the keyboard frame/shelf.
Take the harp to the junkyard.

Take the initiative.Even if it's usually guys that ask the girl out, you shouldn't wait around for him to ask you.
Decide whether your offer should be open-ended or specific.Before you ask out the guy in question, you should take a moment to consider what your offer will entail.
Pitch the movie to him before asking.If you're nervous about asking the guy to a movie, if helps to bring up the movie first.
Keep it casual.A movie date is a casual outing, so the way you go about asking should be treated in much the same way.
Be open to going in a group.There's a chance your original idea of a film date will end up encompassing a group.
Find out what's playing.Simply enough, you'll need to find out what films are playing before you're able to pick something out.
Pick a film that's suitable for a date.Romantic comedies and horror films are generally seen to be the best type of movie to take a date to.
Avoid extremely popular films.If you're going on a date with someone, you're going to want at least some privacy.
Contemplate the sort of movie he might like to see.
Consider wearing perfume or cologne.If you want your date to be a hit, light perfume or cologne may be just the thing.
Figure out payment for the film.
Pick isolated seats.Even if the theatre isn't very crowded, it's still better to get seats that are relatively off to the back and isolated.
Enjoy light touching together.
Relax.

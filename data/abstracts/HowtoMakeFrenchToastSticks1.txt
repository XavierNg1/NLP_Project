Prepare your pan or griddle.
Cut each slice of bread into thirds and set aside.
In a shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and vanilla extract.
In a separate bowl, mix together the sugar and cinnamon using a fork.
Dip the first bread stick into the egg mixture.
Dip the egg-coated stick into cinnamon-sugar mixture.
Place the bread stick onto the frying pan, then repeat the dipping process for the rest of the sticks until you fill the pan.
Cook the sticks for 2 to 3 minutes before flipping them over.
Remove the French toast sticks from heat, and continue dipping and frying the rest until you have none left.
Take the sticks off the heat and place them on a plate.
Serve the French toast sticks with your choice of topping.

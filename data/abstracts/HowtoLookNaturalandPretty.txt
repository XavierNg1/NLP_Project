Take care of your skin.
Pinpointing what it is with your skin that you want to fix is a much better option then slapping make-up on, which will just make it worse.
Even if you have normal or good skin, you still need to take care of it.
Try to avoid foundation.
Try to avoid using a lot of face make-up.
Take care of your hair.
Avoid excessively tight or baggy clothes and buy well-fitting clothes instead.
Always maintain good hygiene.

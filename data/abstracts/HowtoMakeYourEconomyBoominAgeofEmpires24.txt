As with previous ages, there are a few things that should be done in very quick succession:Select three villagers from wood and create a town center in a strategic place, preferably next to a forest and a gold or stone mine (if all three are found next to each other, then that is ideal).
Research heavy plow.
Build a university and castle.
Keep expanding your civilization.
A monastery may be built to create monks.
Trade carts are an excellent way to get gold if you are playing with at least 1 ally.
Research the Imperial Age.

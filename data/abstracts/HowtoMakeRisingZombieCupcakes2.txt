Make the cupcakes following the recipe.
Frost with chocolate frosting for the dirt.
Mold the hands from the sugar paste, fondant or other edible paste you're using.
Push a toothpick into the base of each hand, enough to stay embedded in the hand and enough to poke into the cupcake and be anchored.
Display and serve.

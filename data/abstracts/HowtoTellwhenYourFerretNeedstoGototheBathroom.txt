When holding your ferret, they may be trying to climb out of your arms.
Ferrets always walk backwards before using the bathroom, when both urinating and defecating.
If your ferret has just woken up, they will most likely need to use the bathroom.
Some ferrets make high pitched sounds when they need to use the bathroom desperately.
Ferrets lift up their tails when they need to defecate.

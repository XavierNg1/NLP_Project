The most cliched and overused ways for a villain to die is getting shot, stabbed or falling to one's death.
Make sure the death fits the villain.
Do not make the death a total accident.
Don't make the death simplistic.
Know you audience.
Make sure that the death fits with the genre.
Try to level out predictability.
Not every villain has to die.
Make sure that if your villain does die they do at least 3 evil things to deserve that fate or 1 evil thing that is so downtrodden that it has to be so.

Next, make the floor.
Once you have the floor shape cut out, you need to stick balsa wood all around the outside shape for both sides of the caravan.
Next job is the front and back ends of the caravan.
Glue the sides to the floor.
By now it's probably starting to resemble a caravan.
Cut a piece of balsa to fit across the top of each end of the caravan.

When the main body of the caravan is finished, make the 'A' frame.
Caravan models can have cardboard wheels, but if you made more than one caravan, you might get bored because of the time it takes to make each one individually.

Windows can be made by simply cutting the shape from clear plastic.
Axle & Suspension: This can be purely functional, or you can make it look realistic as well.
Line up the suspension / axle assembly under the caravan.

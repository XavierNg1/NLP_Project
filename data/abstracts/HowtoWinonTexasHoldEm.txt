Before you act, determine your table position.
When the dealer is laying the flop, watch your opponents, not the cards.
There are many betting strategies that you can employ when you have a strong hand.
If you are sure you have the nuts (the best hand), you need to make bets that are as large as you believe your opponent(s) will call.

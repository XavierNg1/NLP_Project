Pick an angle to sharpen your knife.
Lubricate your whetstone or diamond stone with a small amount of mineral oil.
Use an angle guide to control your edge's angle, if available.
Start off on the rough grit side of the stone.
For a symmetrical edge, sharpen the knife by dragging it across the stone in the opposite direction you would move it to slice a thin layer off the stone.
Continue grinding at this angle until your grind goes roughly halfway through the steel.
Flip the knife over and sharpen the other side of the blade until you create a new edge.
Flip the stone over and begin sharpening one side the blade, this time using the finer grit.
Flip the knife and begin sharpening the one side of the knife on the fine grit side of the stone.
Begin alternating swipes on the fine grit.
If you wish, further polish or even strop the edge to the desired sharpness.

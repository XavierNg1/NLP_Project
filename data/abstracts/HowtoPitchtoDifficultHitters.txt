Develop an off speed pitch.
Location is as important, if not more important than velocity.
Mix your pitches up.
When you are way ahead in the count (0-2, 1-2) you may want to try a purpose pitch.
Do not be intimidated by stronger hitters, hit the corners and mix your pitches up efficiently and you most likely will not be hit.

Do not change your mechanics if you aren't throwing as hard you normally do.

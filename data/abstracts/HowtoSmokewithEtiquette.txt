Smoke only tasteful natural shag, the more tasteful the tobacco the better.
Roll your tobacco with care, it is not just another cigarette.

,
Always take care and roll your cigarettes at the time of smoking them, never pre-roll cigarettes.

,
Never smoke an entire cigarette at once.
Put all cigarettes out in an ashtray.
Take a drag, breathing the smoke in and out in a calm, fluid motion.
Breathe calm, deep, clear breaths of clean air between drags.
Take a clear breath of clean air filling up your lungs halfway.
Play with the smoke with your tongue.
Breathe out in one fluid, clear breath, the clear air in your lungs pushing over your numbed tongue, and release it softly.
You will begin to cough up ash from your lungs if you practice these habits, this is is a good thing.

,
Smoke with taste, don't just smoke to smoke, or to be part of the crowd.

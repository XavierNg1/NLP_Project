Design your space.
Document individual set-up steps for each element.
Place two strings width-wise across the room, spaced about 10 feet apart if possible.
Cut sections of gossamer off a roll to identical lengths so about 2 feet hangs off either side of the line and the rest drapes from one line to another.
Lower sting and find the center.
Once everything is secured, raise into place.

,
Decorate an inexpensive lighted arch with colored gossamer.
Place the arch about 2 feet inside the entry doorway.
Attach the long end of the black gossamer to the frame of the arch and attach the other side to the wall above the door.
Assemble EZ up tents inside the space.
Gather the gossamer around the leg so that it blouses or spreads out at the top and tie with ribbon or string (use curling ribbon) in the center.

,
Tie/staple colored streamers (paper or metallic) to the frame.
Put up cardboard cutouts of stars, moons and genie lamps decorated with glitter.
Cover tables with brightly colored tablecloths.
Make inexpensive vases.
Place inexpensive candle holders on the tables with tea lights inside.
Add colorful chocolate coins and Mardi Gras for color.

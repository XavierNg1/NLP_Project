Sit in a comfortable place, free of distractions and noise.
Picture your root chakra, at the base of the spine.
Focus on your second chakra, the sacral or naval in your lower abdomen.
Direct your attention just above the navel and below your chest, the solar plexus chakra.
Think about your heart chakra, in the middle of your chest.
Open your mouth and breathe deeply, using your throat chakra.
Focus on your “Third Eye” Chakra located on the forehead, just above the eyes.
Take a deep inhale and release; focus on your crown chakra, the top of your head.
Imagine a white light flowing down from the crown through all your chakras to your root, firmly planted on the earth.

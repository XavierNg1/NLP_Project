Start in your closet.
If the garment or shoes are ripped, torn and cannot be tailored or worn, recycle it.
If it has a great deal of sentimental value linked to it, but you never wear it, then put it in a box, and tuck it under your bed or in the basement.
Make repairs.
Put clothes in the following categories: looks good and fits, would look great if it fit, and never looked great but is almost new.

,
Keep the first category, think seriously about the second category, and think about consigning the third category.
Choose what stays.
Go to the garment bag and put in your special occasion clothing.
Group together shirts, then pants, then suits, so it's easy to find things fast every morning or when you're on the go.

Tie the ends of 10 lengths together (or more for a bigger net, but make it an even number) of 7 feet (2.1 m) long strings.
You should ask someone to hold the net up by the knot or nail the knot up or you'll get very confused and the string will get very tangled.

,
Measure 4 inches (10.2 cm) down (or less for a smaller-holed net) and mark with a felt-tip pen.
Mark 4 inches (10.2 cm) down again from the row of knots that you just tied.
Mark, pair, tie and continue this for each row.
Make sure you have 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) of string left after your last mark, when you get to your last row.
Thread a strong plastic drawstring through the loops.
Finished.

Boil 1 cup (225 grams) of sugar and 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water in a small pot.
Squeeze the juice from enough lemons to fill 1 cup (240 milliliters).
Pour the lemon juice into a large pitcher.
Add 4 cups (950 milliliters) of cold water.
Stir in enough of the sugar-water until you get your desired sweetness.
Let the lemonade reach room temperature.
Boil 6 cups (1.4 liters) of water in a large pot.
Take the pot off the stove, and add 3 to 4 bags of black tea.
Let the tea steep, covered, for 5 minutes.
Take the tea bags out after 5 minutes, then discard them.
Pour the tea into a large pitcher and let it cool down to room temperature.
Get a tall, narrow glass.
Fill the glass half-way with ice.
Fill the glass partway with lemonade.
Fill the rest of the glass with the tea.
Garnish with a few mint leaves or a lemon wedge, if desired.

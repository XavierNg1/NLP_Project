First find the method that suits how you like to play the game( increasing your opponents draw, stall, and destroying their deck), for example if you like to sit back and watch as the other player is unable to do anything, stalling is for you.
Now that you have picked the way in which you will mill the other players deck you have two main choices on how to build the basis of your deck.
Now that you have picked how you will mill other players decks and how your deck will do that, its time to start building your deck.
First narrow your list of cards down to about 30 cards, no more than 34, and no less than 25.
After step 4, if you are aiming for a 40 card deck, you should have about 10 cards left to add.
Now it's time to play test your deck.If you are using stall, you should run against another deck to see how long you can survive.
Now that you have test played your deck you can take out the cards that don't work in your deck, and add other cards that will work better.

,
Repeat steps 4,5,6,and 7as many times as needed to make your deck work the way you want it to.
Now that you have your main deck it's time to make a side deck.
Play games with about 5 different types of decks to see what doesn't work in your deck(much like in step 6 but a real game not just to see how long you can live, or how many cards you can mill in so many terns).

,
Again, after playing those 5 or so games, take out the cards that don't work, and add other cards that will work better.

,
Repeat steps 10 and 11 until you are pleased with your deck.

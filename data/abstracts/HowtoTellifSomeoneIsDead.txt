Do not fool around.
Call the person's name.
Ask outright if the person is playing dead.
Poke the person a little.
Check the pulse.
Perhaps the easiest way to tell if someone is dead is by holding a mirror just under their nose or in front of their mouth for several minutes.Does the mirror fog up or is there condensation present?,
Hold a flashlight in the person's eyes.
Find something that smells really strong and wave it under the person's nose.

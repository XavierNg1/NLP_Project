Gather and chop your chocolate into even pieces.
Heat up a pot of water, but do not bring it to boil.
Place the chocolate pieces in a completely dry, stainless steel bowl, and then onto the steaming pan.
Melt the chocolate, stirring, until it is just at 110°F.
Introduce the remaining 1/3 solid chocolate into melted chocolate and continue stirring.
Begin "tabling" the chocolate on a smooth, cool surface such as marble.
Stirring constantly, wait until the chocolate gets to a temperature of 87°–91°F.

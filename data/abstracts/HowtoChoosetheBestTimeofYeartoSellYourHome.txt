Sell in the spring.While you can choose to sell your home at any time of the year, spring is the most popular time to sell a home because it is the time that the most buyers are looking.More buyers are in the market for new homes during the spring because they have received their tax rebate checks and can now better afford the down payment and other costs associated with buying a home.In addition, the days are longer, meaning that there is more time for showing your house to potential buyers.It also seems that more home sales during the spring months in particular occur at full asking price.
Consider selling in autumn.

Consider the condition of your home.
Sell when the weather is best.

Opt for antibiotics for your dog.Although canine influenza is a viral infection, many veterinarians will offer your dog antibiotics in order to prevent what is called a "secondary bacterial infection.",
Prevent the spread of infection to other dogs.While your dog is recovering from canine influenza, it is important to keep them at home and isolated from other dogs.
Monitor your dog's progress.Your dog should begin to feel better over the course of a few days to a week or so, and symptoms should begin to dissipate and ultimately disappear.

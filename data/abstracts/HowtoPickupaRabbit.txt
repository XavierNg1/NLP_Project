Help your rabbit get comfortable with handling by petting the rabbit gently.
Know how not to pick up a rabbit.
Practice placing your palm under the rabbit's chest and gently lifting its front legs off the ground, then setting it back down.
Gently use the loose skin behind the rabbit’s neck to hold onto its scruff.
Use two hands to lift the rabbit up.
Use the right approach.
Coax the rabbit out of a hiding place, don't drag it out.
Look for warning signs that the rabbit will not allow you to pick it up.
Hold the bunny with the head slightly higher than the hindquarters.
Lift the rabbit carefully to your side (or in front of your mid abdomen), under your arm.
Pass your rabbit to another person correctly.
Limit possible injury.
Use a carrying case or a wrap for extra-wriggly rabbits.
Lower the rabbit carefully to the ground (or a top-loading carrier) while holding the bunny in the “football hold.” There is a risk of releasing the rabbit when it is in your arms and the rabbit landing on the ground poorly and injuring itself.
Place a rabbit in a front loading carrier by putting it in hind legs first with the rabbit facing you.
Reward the rabbit with a treat.

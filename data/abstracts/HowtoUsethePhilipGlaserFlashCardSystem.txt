Make or buy a set of 78 cards - one card for each note on the guitar up to and including the 12th fret.
Test yourself with the first 6 cards – the cards for the open strings of the guitar (E,A,D,G,B and E), played without pressing on any frets.
Look at the cards for frets 1 – 4.
Take the cards that cover frets 5 – 8.
Take the cards that cover frets 9 – 12.
Shuffle the pack of cards, and then test yourself with a few cards every day, taking a few cards from the shuffled pack.

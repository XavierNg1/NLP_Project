Get your fully tacked horse warmed up using a lunge line.
Mount your horse, and bring it through every pace, starting with the walk, trot, and lope/canter for a good amount of time.
Push your horse into the gallop the same way you would at the lope/canter.

,
Make sure that you are not leaning too far back.
Cut corners a little more than usual, and keep a nice distance from the rail (if you're on a track), so you won't be accidentally rammed into it.

,
Position your legs so that they do not dig into the horse's sides.

,
Enjoy the pace!,
Slow your horse down slowly.
Thoroughly cool down your horse!

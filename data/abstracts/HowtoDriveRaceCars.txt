Consider certain factors when driving a race car:


Weight of the vehicle (including yourself) and the weight ratio
The car's grip
The car's stopping power
The power and torque of the engine
The steering of the car
The car's suspension;
,
Perhaps one of the most important factors is grip.
But knowing the grip of the car will be very handy as it will tell you how fast you can go when making a turn with a certain radius.
Another important thing to remember about corners is the car's suspension.
Also, knowing how the car's suspension handles will get you acclimated to the car better.
Another thing that is good to know is how fast the car responds to turning the wheel.
The next thing to keep in mind is stopping power.
The last thing to keep in mind is the power and torque of the engine.

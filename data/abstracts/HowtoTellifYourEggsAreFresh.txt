Look at the side or the end of the carton to find the stamped date and buy the latest date.
Take eggs straight home and store them immediately in the refrigerator set at 40 °F (4 °C) or slightly below.
Watch for eggs that cracked on the way home from the store.
Use raw shell eggs within 3 to 5 weeks.
Egg mixtures are safe if they reach 160 °F (71 °C), so homemade ice cream and eggnog can be made safely from a cooked base.
Choose Grade A or AA eggs with clean, uncracked shells.
Serve cooked eggs and dishes containing eggs immediately after cooking, or place in shallow containers for quick cooling and refrigerate at once for later use.
To check for freshness of raw eggs at home, place the questionable egg in a pot of cold water.
A fresh egg out of its shell will have a thick white that doesn't spread out too much, and a yolk that is firm and holds its shape.

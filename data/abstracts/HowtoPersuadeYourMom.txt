Give yourself time to prepare.You’re about to have a hard conversation that could easily turn into a fight if you’re not careful.
Brainstorm a list of reasons why you want what you want.
Detail the reasons you believe you deserve it.
Sweeten the pot with a bribe.
Predict and answer her concerns.
Choose the right time.Timing is everything when it comes to having a big conversation.
Provide her with all the information she needs to know.
Ask her for her honest reason for why she’s resisting.Sometimes, parents just give “parent” answers instead of real ones.
Ask her to set her own conditions.By making a request, then asking her to change the rules and limits of what you asked for, you’re showing her that you respect her authority.
Ask for a delayed response if she says "no" at first.
Pick your battles.
Stay as calm as possible.If it looks like your mom is going to say no, you might feel the telltale signs of anger and frustration: your skin starts feeling hot, your heart beats faster, your voice starts getting higher and louder.
Choose your words carefully.
Don’t interrupt her.
Use attentive body language.To persuade your mother, you want to use every tool in your kit, and nonverbal communication is a very effective tool when it comes to persuading someone.
Be honest with her.Every time you get caught lying to your mother, you make it that much harder to win her over the next time you need to persuade her of something.

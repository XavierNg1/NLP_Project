Listen to lots of existing concept albums.
Try to become a good songwriter for songs generally.
Try to identify your concept.
Once you've got some kind of storyline in your head, try to separate it into various themes or moods for different parts / scenes and WRITE THEM DOWN.
Try to decide on specific styles, sets of chords or repeating sequences of notes or chords (technically called "leitmotifs") or sound effects to represent different things.
Start writing lyrics and music around this framework you've built up.

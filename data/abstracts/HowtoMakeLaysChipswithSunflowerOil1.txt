Scrub and peel your potato.
Slice your chips as thin as possible with a mandolin or sharp knife.
Place your sliced potatoes in a bowl of salted, cold water for 30 minutes.
Blot the chips dry with paper towels after 30 minutes.
Heat 2 inches of sunflower oil in a pan on medium heat.
Cook the potatoes for 2-3 minutes in the oil, stirring regularly to prevent sticking.

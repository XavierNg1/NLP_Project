Contact the agency or person hosting the show.
Request a registration form or a 'prize list' as they are often called at large Hunter/Jumper shows.

,
Fill out the registration form with all of you and your horse's information.
If the show is several days or even weeks long, you must make arrangements for your horse's stabling.
Once you have completed the registration form, simply return it.
Remember to keep the portion of the prize list that has the schedule and description of classes.
On the day of the show, register with the show office.
Also, it is general practice to leave an 'open check' with the show office.
Remember you must give notice if you intend to scratch a class.

Realize that you have a problem.
Rather than focusing on the negative, see this time in your life as an opportunity to improve yourself.
Make a list of the reasons that you want to stop drinking (or cut back).
Pay attention to how you feel when you are sober.
If you really want to win the war on alcoholism you should get rid of any tempting alcohol you may have in the house.
When you start to feel weak think of all the progress you've made.

If you're making a tufted headboard, drill your holes first.
Use a spray fixative to attach the padding to the back of the headboard.
Pull the batting taut over the padding on the front of the headboard and staple it onto the back of the headboard.
Iron any wrinkles out of your headboard fabric.
Line up the pattern of the fabric with the headboard and begin stapling the fabric down to the back of the headboard.
Feed your buttons through the holes for a tufted look.
Attach the headboard to your wall.

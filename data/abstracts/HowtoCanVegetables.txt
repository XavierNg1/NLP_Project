Prepare the vegetables for canning.
Clean 7 glass quart (946mL) canning jars and metal lids with soap and hot water.
Combine all the vegetables in a large pot, add enough water to cover pieces and boil for 5 minutes.
Wipe the rims of the jars with a clean cloth, stir gently to allow air bubbles to escape and cover with the metal lids.
Place the cover securely on the canner and heat water to boiling.
Process jars in the pressure canner for 90 minutes, adjusting the pressure based on your altitude (see guide below).Start timing when the necessary pressure is reached.
Turn off heat and allow pressure to return to 0 PSI (0 kPa), then remove the weights or open the vent and wait for 2 minutes.
Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter and place them on a wooden board or thick kitchen towel to allow them to cool in a draft free area.
Label the jars with ingredients and the date, then store in a cool, dark and dry location.

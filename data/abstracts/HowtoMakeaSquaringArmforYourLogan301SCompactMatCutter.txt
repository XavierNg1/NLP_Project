Start by cutting your yard sticks.
After cutting it to size, drill your holes through which to put your screws.
Now take your sixteen inch bar and cut a 1/4” deep notch between 5 7/8” and 6” from one side.
Now take your angle plate and drill a hole, just big enough for your machine screws to fit through, in the center of one of the sides.
Place the bar on the side of your board, with 8” of the notched side sticking out.
Place the angle plate on the other side with the drilled hole not against the wood.
Now for drilling into your mat cutter.
Screw in the fittings and attach the squaring arm to the cutter.Lastly stick the feet on the bottom of the squaring arm.

If you would like to, you can set your timer for 10 minutes

,
Take a pencil and place it in the center of your paper.

,
Start the timer and look away so you can't see the paper.

,
Start drawing.
After ten minutes are up, stop drawing and look at your image.
Try to find some real-life shapes in your drawing (they are in there, you just have to look for them.),
Take some colored pencils, or paints, or anything that can bring color to your image and start coloring the background around your shapes.

Cleanse the spot you plan to tattoo.
Exfoliate the area before the temporary tattoo is applied.Usually the very top layer of your skin is actually dead skin cells that we shed or scrub off.
Choose an area where the skin won't constantly be moving or flexing or coming into contact with oils and other substances.
Shave the area before the temporary tattoo is applied.
Wash the areas around the tattoo, not the tattoo itself.
Cover your tattoo with petroleum jelly, which can act as a sealant.
Use baby powder, corn starch, or talcum powder on the tattoo.
Go over your tattoo with a permanent marker when it begins to fade.
Take a break from working out.
Keep the henna paste wet as long as possible.
Warm your skin while the henna paste is drying.
Never use "black henna," though it may promise to make your tattoo last longer.
Avoid water for 24 hours after removing henna.Applying a coat of petroleum jelly can help create a seal over the tattoo and repel water.

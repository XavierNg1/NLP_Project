Obtain an 11" X 14" pad of 140# cold press watercolor paper from an art and craft store.
Use tube paints.
Select a round #10 brush that comes to a perfect point.
Fill a large container with water.  ,Have tissues, sheets of paper towel and paper napkins at hand and have an old piece of terrycloth towel at hand to hold your brushes.
Dive into the painting.
Begin painting by touching the tip of your damp brush into a color for the tulip and just touch the tip of your paint loaded brush to the edge of your wet blossom.
Repeat, if you wish, with the same or a different color or switch colors.
Move along to the stem.
To create a ragged edge on the flower petal, drop in some clean water from your brush held slightly above the paper.
Expect excess water to pool at the edges of the wet shape, in this case a tulip head.
Watch for accidental effects to happen as the water, paint and humidity begin to work on your color application and leave them.Repeat with another flower head and stem until you have an uneven number of flowers.
Do leafs by starting from the bottom of the page and, using only clear water, making a slightly curved stroke that ends in a clean point to indicate the long, dagger shape of a leaf.
Analyze your work before putting in a background color.

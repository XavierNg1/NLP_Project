Think about what your school gives you to work with already.
Use this to your advantage.
Start with a good base.
Get some nice, unique shoes.
Do something with your hair.
Accessorize!,
At the end of the day, the tip to being successful and unique in school, is to read the rules and compromise!,
Make up.
In winter always take a lip balm with you to school because then your lips are likely to get chapped with the cold and chapped lips are not nice to look at!

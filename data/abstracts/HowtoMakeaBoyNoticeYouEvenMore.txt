Be friends with him.
Always be there for your crush.
Give him a few cute little clues.
Flirt a little bit.
Talk to a guy as a guy.
Have him chase you.
If you're not necessarily the prettiest of girls, try to ask him what he looks for in a girl.
When the time is right lean in and kiss him on the cheek or lips and quickly pull away and walk away, leaving him wanting more!

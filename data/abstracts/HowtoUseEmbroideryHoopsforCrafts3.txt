Use the embroidery hoop for your loom.
Cut an old T-shirt into one-inch-wide loops.
Stretch the loop one by one over the embroidery hoop, spacing them evenly.
Attach the first weft by looping it over a warp and then through itself.
Connect another weft or two using the same method - looping them through the previous weft and again through themselves.

,
Begin by weaving the weft over and under, forming a tight spiral.
Begin treating each warp as 2 separate ones, dividing each individual loop.
Continue weaving and adding warps.
When the rug is the desired size, cut you last weft loop.
Cut the warps one at a time.

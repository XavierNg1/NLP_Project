Write down both of the equations that you'll need to solve.
Number the equations.
Check if both equations have the same variable/unknown term in them.

,
Look for signs of the unknown variables or terms.
Solve to find the first unknown variable from the resulting (rather shortened) equation.
25 divided by 5 makes 5 so we have now found the value of "x" which is 5.

,
Find the value of "y".
Check the problem.

Know your time limit.
Plan.
Set up your working area.
Make yourself comfortable.
Have a glass of water with you, and a few light snacks.
Don't focus too much on the snacks and try to focus most of your attention on the work you are doing.
Take a quick break.
Listen to some music to settle yourself.
Bring your mobile to keep yourself alert.
If you are using a computer, have emails ready and a few other tabs open.
Make it fun by organizing your work and making it neat.
Be proud of your work!

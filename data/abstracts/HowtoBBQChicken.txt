If using a whole chicken, cut it up into pieces.
Make a brine.
Allow the brine to cool, then submerge the chicken in it for at least eight hours or overnight.
Rub the chicken with barbecue sauce.
Stack coals in a pyramid shape in the grill pit, squirting with lighter fluid with every couple of layers.
Let coals burn for at least 20 minutes, until they are red and glowing instead of actively flaming.








,
Using a grill scraper, bank the glowing coals to one side of the pit.
Place sauced chicken on the cool side of the grill, away from the glowing coals.
Rotate and re-sauce the chicken at least once during the cooking process in order to ensure everything cooks evenly.








,
After chicken has been mostly cooked on the interior, brush pieces again with barbecue sauce.
Cook chicken over hot coals, skin-side down, until sauce becomes syrupy and skin is very crisp.
Remove chicken to a serving platter and allow to rest for five minutes.








,
Serve with plenty of napkins.

Ask yourself these questions: What is the basic territory?,
Now that you have the most basic of territory, get specific.
Now describe why all of these places are dangerous, filled with prey, apprentices are trained there.
Now that you have the basic territory filled out, draw a picture of it, and DON'T include the camp in your drawing.
Now that you have placed your camp, it is time to place the dens, the fresh-kill pile, the high rock, and anything else you want to add in your camp.

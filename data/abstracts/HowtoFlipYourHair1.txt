Start with clean, damp hair.
Take a small section of hair and place it between a round brush and the nozzle of the hair dryer.
Bring the brush and hair dryer down towards the center of the hair shaft.
Twist the round brush when you are half-way down the hair shaft.
Touch up with a flat iron if you have thick or curly hair.

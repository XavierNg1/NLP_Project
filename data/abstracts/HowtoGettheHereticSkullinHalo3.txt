Begin a Forge session on the Heretic map.
Enter editor mode (or oracle form) by pressing UP on the D-Pad once you have begun play.
Move to the Energy Sword platform in the middle of the map.
Face the front of the map, the area with large windows looking into space.
Turn to your right, approximately 90 degrees from the front of the map.
Look for two blue vents to the right of the sword platform.
Fly over to the ledge and change from editor mode back into player form by pressing UP on the D-Pad again, landing on the ledge where the skull is resting.
Check your Xbox 360 gamerscore and achievement statistics and you will see that the Heretic Skull achievement has been unlocked for 25 gamerscore.

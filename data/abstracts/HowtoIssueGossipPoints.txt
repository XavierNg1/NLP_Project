Make a Scale: Obviously, not all gossip is as juicy as others, so having a pre-set general scale will help when deciding how many points the gossiper gets.
Awarding points should be done fairly, of course, but if a member of your clique constantly reports gossip that is not important/late/dull or otherwise untrue, then you are more than welcome to deduct half to a full point of Gossip points from their total.
Gossip should be handled delicately, so even though you and your clique/friends find it totally alpha, and cool to gossip right in front of the victim(s), it's actually mean, and very bitchy.

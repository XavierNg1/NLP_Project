Evaluate your energy levels.One of the most common signs of potential hypothyroidism is fatigue, and/or a recent drop in your energy levels.
Observe any recent weight changes.Hypothyroidism may also cause you to gain weight, again because your metabolism is slowed down below its normal level.
Notice how you feel in the cold.Another potential consequence of hypothyroidism is an intolerance of cold weather, meaning that you feel less able to handle being out in the cold.
Consider any changes in your skin, hair, or eyes.Hypothyroidism can lead to signs such as drier, thicker skin (from the glycosaminoglycan deposits in your tissues); a lack of sweating (due to decreased metabolism); fewer, coarser hairs on your body or eyebrows; and/or brittle nails.
Watch for changes in your mood or sleep habits.For some, hypothyroidism can manifest as a depressed mood.
Take note of unusual constipation.Hypothyroidism can also lead to constipation.
Be aware of any unusual shortness of breath.Sometimes hypothyroidism can cause you to be short of breath, particularly during exertion.
Be on the lookout for other potential signs.Hypothyroidism can manifest in a variety of different ways, and varies from person to person.

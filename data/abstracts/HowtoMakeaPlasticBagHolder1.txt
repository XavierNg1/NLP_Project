Clean a plastic, 2-liter soda bottle, then peel off the label.
Cut off the top portion of the bottle so that you have a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) wide opening.
Cut the bottom off of the plastic bottle.
Use a pair of scissors to trim away ragged edges on the top and bottom.
Paint or decorate the bottle, if desired.
Punch two holes on both sides of the cut bottom edge, and thread a ribbon through them.
Hang the holder by the ribbon, then fill it with plastic bags.
Use the plastic bag older.

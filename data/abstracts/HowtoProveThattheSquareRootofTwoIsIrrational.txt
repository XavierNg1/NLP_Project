Assume that2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} is rational.
Square both sides.
Multiply both sides by b2{\displaystyle b^{2}}.
Note that a2{\displaystyle a^{2}} is an even number.
Substitute a=2k{\displaystyle a=2k} into the original equation.
Expand (2k)2{\displaystyle (2k)^{2}}.
Multiply both sides by b2{\displaystyle b^{2}}.
Divide both sides by two.
Note that b2{\displaystyle b^{2}} is an even number.
Recognise that this is a contradiction.

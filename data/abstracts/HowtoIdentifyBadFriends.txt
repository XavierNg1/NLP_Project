Watch out for the opportunist.
Be wary of the self-centered.
Steer clear of the victim, who exudes "poor me", and "my life is horrible".
Detach yourself from the clingy friend.
Sidestep the fake.
Avoid the snob.
Get rid of the spy.
Pass by the friend who ignores you.
Beware the interloper.
Avoid the queen bee.
Decide whether or not the friendship is worth continuing with.
Cease staying in contact.
Tell your friend the friendship is over when this feels appropriate.

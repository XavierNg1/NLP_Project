Find live frequencies.
Memorize some of the basic frequencies.
Find an aeronautical sectional chart.
Find the closest airport on the chart.
If the airport is uncontrolled (no tower) or the tower operates part time, a C in a circle after a frequency number will be used to denote a Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF).
All controlled airports will be denoted by blue circles, while uncontrolled airports are magenta.
Some airports have AWOS (Automated Weather Observing System), ASOS (Automated Surface Observing System), or ATIS (Automated Terminal Information Service) frequencies listed on the chart.
If you have access to an airport/facility directory, you can find more frequencies than those available on the chart.
If a controller gives a pilot an instruction, he or she will prefix it with the aircraft's identification number.
After the flight number, the controller will give an instruction such as "enter downwind.",
Sometimes, controllers will "hand off" a pilot to another frequency.
Operations at uncontrolled airports are much less formal.

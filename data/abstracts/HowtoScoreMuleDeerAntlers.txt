Dry the antlers thoroughly before you try to score them.
Make sure the antlers are dry and the skull plate is intact if you want to request an official measuring by a Boone and Crockett representative.
Go to the Boone and Crockett website.
Opt to print out a PDF of the scoring sheet or click directly on the link that reads, “Typical Mule Deer & Blacktail.”

Request a score sheet from the Fish, Wildlife and Parks if you have a mule deer tag in your area.

Arrange two ways of measuring.
Count the number of points on each antler.
Identify the number of abnormal points.
Measure the length, from beam to tip, of the normal points, one at a time.
Measure the length of the abnormal points.
Identify the tips of the main beams.
Move to the greatest spread.
Measure the inside spread of the main beams.
Use your flexible steel cable and yardstick for this section.

,
Wrap your steel cable around the right antler between the burr of the antler, where it starts and the first point.
Wrap the cable around the circumference of the antler between the first and second points, at the widest point.
Wrap the cable around the angler between the main (front) beam and the third point.
Wrap the cable around the antler between the second and fourth points.
Give information on your name, personal information and the location the deer was found to submit it for official scoring.

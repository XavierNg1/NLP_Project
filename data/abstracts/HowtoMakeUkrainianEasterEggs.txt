Test out the flow of the wax - this is crucial - on some newspaper before applying on the egg.
Cover all pencil lines on both sides of the egg with the wax.
When you have reached the stage of the final color, recheck the wax for any unwanted gaps and then dip your egg in the dye.
Take the egg and hold it near the side of the flame.
If you wish to varnish the egg, do it now.
Let the egg sit for 15-20 minutes and then you can put it on display!

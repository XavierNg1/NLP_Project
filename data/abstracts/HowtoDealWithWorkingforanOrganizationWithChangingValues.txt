Consider that even without dramatic change, a good business is always progressing incrementally, improving the way that it works, improving the delivery of services, improving the types of products it sells, etc.
Realize that we all change, including the workplace.
Consider whether you're now feeling out of your comfort zone.
Consider whether you're so tied up in your own sense of what is right that you have become rigid and unable to see when change is good.
Spend time learning about the changing values.
Get inter-generational.

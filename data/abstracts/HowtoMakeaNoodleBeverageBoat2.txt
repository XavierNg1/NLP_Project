Cut a pool noodle into four equal parts.
Measure each side of your container and cut the noodle to fit each side.
Thread the noodle parts over a long, sturdy string or rope.
Fit the noodle pieces around the plastic container.
Test the container in the pool without the drinks to make sure it not only floats but to be sure that the noodle fit is correct.

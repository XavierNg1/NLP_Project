Assess the project.
You will also need to look for accessories or conditions that will make removing the pump difficult.
Determine if you will be able to reach all the bolts that must be removed to remove the water pump, using the above information as a guide.
Make sure the water pump requires repair.
Locate a source for a replacement for your water pump.
Make sure you have the tools required for the project.
Make sure you have the required materials needed to reinstall the water pump, as well.
Park the vehicle in a place you can leave it while you complete the project.
Allow the engine to cool off completely before beginning to remove parts.

,
Disconnect the battery cables, removing the negative cable first to avoid shorting.

,
Remove the serpentine belts or vee belts from the front of the engine if necessary.

,
Remove any accessories necessary to access the water pump(see Step 1), tying items you don't want to disconnect like alternators and power steering pumps out of the way.

,
Drain the radiator by placing a catch container underneath the pit-cock or drain plug at its bottom, then opening the drain.
Remove the fan and fan clutch if they are attached to the water pump, making sure to keep bolts, nuts, and washers separated for re-installation later.

,
Remove the radiator hoses from the water pump.
Remove the bolts that attach the water pump to the engine, making sure, once more, to keep these from getting mixed up with other bolts and fasteners.
Pull the water pump off the engine.
Compare the old water pump to the new one you have purchased to make sure it is exactly the same, including bolt positions, and shaft length.

,
Remove all remaining gasket adhesive and material from the mounting surface of your old water pump.
Apply a thin, uniform coat of gasket sealer to the mounting surface where the new gasket will fit, making sure no excess sealant is inside the water pump chamber itself.
Place the water pump gasket on the sealant on the water pump, pressing it firmly in place while making sure it is aligned correctly.

,
Position the water pump in place, being very careful the gasket stays in the proper position.
Reinstall the water hoses on your water pump, making sure all the clamps are tightened snugly.
Reinstall the rest of the components you removed during the tear down process.
Fill the radiator with coolant (if you suspect you may have a leak, use clear water to test the system prior to use of expensive coolant).

,
Replace the battery cables after all the other components are reinstalled and secured, then crank the engine and check for leaks.

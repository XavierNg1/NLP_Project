Start with a balanced chemical equation.
Calculate the molar mass of each reactant.
Convert the amount of each reactant from grams to moles.
Determine the ratio of the reactants.
Find the ideal ratio for the reaction.
Compare the ratios to find the limiting reactant.
Review the reaction to find the desired product.
Write down the number of moles of your limiting reactant.
Compare the ratio of molecules in product and reactant.
Multiply the ratio by the limiting reactant's quantity in moles.
Convert the result to grams.
Repeat the calculation for the other product if desired.

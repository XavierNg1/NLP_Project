Know what constitutes strength in character.
Understand why strength of character is important to yourself and especially to others:


Strength of character allows you to carry out your will freely, while enabling you to cope with setbacks.
Empathize.
Seek the truth.
Be neither a pessimist nor an optimist, but a leader.
Guard against irrational impulses.
Be content with your lot (not imitating).
Be brave enough to take calculated risks.
Dismiss external suggestions contrary to the resolution you are fixed upon.
Learn to do good and eschew/avoid evil.
Learn to master your feelings.
Be neither prodigal, nor miserly, but seek the middle ground.
Be calm in all things.
Focus on the positives in life, and spare little time for the negatives.
Oppose fatalism.
Have patience -- to enthusiastically set, persist and follow-through on your goals, short term, intermediate and long term: which is progress (success).
Conquer all fears.
Just as a gardener must remove all the weeds to grow the crops, so you must likewise dispel from your mind all feeble thoughts, that act as weeds undermining your strength.
Exercise coolness, circumspection, discernment, and prudence in business.
Always be truthful in all things and every aspect of life.
Finally, excel wherever you are, and do your best in whatever you do.

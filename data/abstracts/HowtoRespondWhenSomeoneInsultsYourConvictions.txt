Don't react immediately.
Speak up for your convictions, but do it in a calm, rational manner.
Stop taking things so personally, and you can give the person the benefit of the doubt.
Ask a question rather than making a statement.
Play Devil's Advocate.
Try to be as diplomatic as possible if you feel the need to reveal your position.
Tell that person you feel insulted.
Take the high road.

Think about why you're sad.
Analyze your actions from the past.
Distract yourself.
Talk to someone close, someone you KNOW you can trust.
Become a better person.
Enjoy yourself.
Be healthy and happy.
Help others.
Eventually, some people who are making rumors and saying very rude things about you will stop because you are a new person.
Stand up for yourself politely and wisely if someone is trying to get in your hair.

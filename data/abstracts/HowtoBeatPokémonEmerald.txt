Train your Pokémon equally.
Each Pokémon's 'personality' differs and they all grow differently.
Catch and use Legendary Pokémon such as Kyogre, Groudon or Rayquaza.
Team Aqua and Team Magma really like two common Pokémon types: Poison and Dark types, much like Team Rocket or Team Galactic.
Take full advantage of all the in-game items and bonuses; they can really help!

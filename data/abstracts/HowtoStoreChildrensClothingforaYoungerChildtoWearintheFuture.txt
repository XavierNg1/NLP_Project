Get some big, heavy plastic storage boxes, such as those made by Rubbermaid.
Get all the clothes that you want to store absolutely CLEAN AND DRY.
Moths and bugs that eat holes in clothes are not actually interested in eating the fabric; they want the spilled food or other stains on there.
If there are torn seams or missing buttons, fix them.

,
Sort the clothes by size, according to how much of them you have and how different they are.
Get rid of what you can.
If you have a really, really special item like a woolen suit or a taffeta dress, take it to the cleaners and have them pack it in a box for you.Â ,
For the regular clothes, make as many piles as you need and figure out how many piles can fit in each box.

,
The best way to store clothes is by rolling them up tight.
Do not use mothballs -- they are very toxic for humans and the smell never really goes away.
Add the clothes to the box.
Store bigger, heavier items on the bottom, like big sweaters and pants.
LABEL THE BOXES AS YOU GO.
Put on lids and store away.

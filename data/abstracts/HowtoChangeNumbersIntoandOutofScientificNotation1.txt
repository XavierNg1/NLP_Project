Start with a very small or very large number.
Cross out the original number's decimal point.
Add a new decimal point to the number so that there's only one non-zero digit in front of it.
Rewrite this number to drop any insignificant digits.
Write "x 10" after the rewritten number.
Count how many times you moved the original decimal point.
Write that number as the exponent over the number 10.
Decide if the exponent should be negative or positive.
Round your number as much as necessary.

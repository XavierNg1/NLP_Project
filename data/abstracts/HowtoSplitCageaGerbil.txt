Think about the gerbils.
Be prepared for the split cage not to work.
Contact your local gerbil breeder or rescue for advice.
Make sure your two gerbils are the same gender and ideally the same age.
Build a secure split cage.
Place a gerbil on each side of the divider.
Swap the gerbils over several times a day.
Repeat for at least a fortnight until you see positive signs.
Remove the divider.
Leave them in the same cage and add nothing new.
Keep an eye on them.

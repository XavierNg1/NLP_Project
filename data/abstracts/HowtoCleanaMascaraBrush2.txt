Fill a cup with warm (not boiling) water and allow your mascara wand to soak for 10-15 minutes.
Squirt a little shampoo into the palm of your hand and scrub the bristles of the mascara wand.
Pat the wand dry with a clean paper towel.
Store the clean, dry brush in a resealable plastic bag.
Putting Your Brush to Work

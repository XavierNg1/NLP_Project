Recognize the possible risks of a ketogenic diet.
Start with a general low-carb diet like Atkins to ease yourself into nutritional ketosis.

Eat as much as 20 or 30 grams of carbs daily.
Eat 2 – 8 ounces of protein several times a day.
Eat fats with all your meals.
Don’t stress too much about calories.
Stay hydrated.
Use a ketone meter to test whether you are in ketosis.
Look for ketosis symptoms (also known as “keto flu”).
Notice that your health has improved (after a few weeks).

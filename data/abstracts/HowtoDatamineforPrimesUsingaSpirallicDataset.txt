In the picture, the primes are depicted in red on a white background and certain rows, columns and diagonals stand out right away as being probable candidates for producing more primes.
Knowing (or further discovering) the formulas for certain primes-rich rows and columns and diagonals you want to investigate, select first the left side of the line returning 10 primes and extended the series from 8 to 32 results.
To investigate the right side of the line, follow the same procedure of analyzing the formula underlying the series 3, 2, 11, 28, 53, etc.
Investigate further.
Investigate the last line.
Check against the Known Primes List.
It may be that by some keen usage of Continued Fractions, in combination with the Spirallic Dataset, for primes vs. Non-Primes, a key discovery might be made, since almost every number (AEN) is susceptible to cogent representation by continued fractions.
Expect a big decrease.See the article How to Create a Spirallic Numbers Dataset for a list of articles related to Excel, Geometric and/or Trigonometric Art, Charting/Diagramming and Algebraic Formulation.For more art charts and graphs, you might also want to click on Category:Microsoft Excel Imagery, Category:Mathematics, Category:Spreadsheets or Category:Graphics to view many Excel worksheets and charts where Trigonometry, Geometry and Calculus have been turned into Art, or simply click on the category as appears in the upper right white portion of this page, or at the bottom left of the page.

Keep the whetstone prepared and ready like any other sharpening.
Turn your coarsest stone sideways.
Run the tip of the knife horizontally across the side of your coarsest whetstone to grind it back to a point.
Rock the knife back and forth on the stone, as if cutting with it, to round out the edge.
Sharpen the entire knife after fixing the tip.

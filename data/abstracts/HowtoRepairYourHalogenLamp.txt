Please read all steps, tips and warnings completely before attempting.
Identify the reason that a lamp (lighting fixture) won't function.
Determine value of the fixture or cost of replacement.
Use extreme care to prevent burns.
Test the bulb(s) in known a working lamp to determine if they are "good".
Unplug (or otherwise disconnect) the fixture from the power source.
Remove the lamp (if not already out) from the socket or holder.
Install the lamp.
Test the recent adjustments / cleaning.
Remove the base of the fixture or other area to access the wiring compartment or switch.
Inspect for burned, broken, or loose wires.
Use a Multimeter or VOM (Volt-Ohm Meter) for additional testing if the fixture still does not function.
If you can use a VOM and have one, then (with the fixture plugged in) measure the transformer output usually 12volts, if nothing there, then measure the transformer input 120 volts, if you have the 120 volts, then the transformer is bad most likely.

,
You must take the on/off switch into consideration and with POWER OFF test it for continuity.

,If no 120 at the transformer input, then your power cord or plug is the cause and you have to examine it and test it for continuity (unplugged of course)

,
You can purchase transformers, and bulb sockets from your local electrical supply store, maybe even Radio Shack, or you can search the web and there are many places that handle these parts.

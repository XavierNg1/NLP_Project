Decide on a word to teach your bird.
Tell your bird this word often.
Be persistent!,
If your bird is an exceptionally intelligent kind, like an Amazon, Macaw, or African Grey, try to teach him the meanings of words.
Whenever your bird learns a new word, reward her with a special treat like a nut, seed, or a tiny bit of cheese, along with plenty of scratches and praise!

Get it connected.
Rescan.
Insert the FPC application into a blank pattern.
Once you are in the FPC application, sync the external drum pad with FL Studio so that when you hit a pad, the same corresponding pad is hit in the software.
While still in FPC, in the upper right corner will be a tab next to midi note labeled “C” or “F#” (something of this nature.),
Your external device will now be synced with FL Studio.

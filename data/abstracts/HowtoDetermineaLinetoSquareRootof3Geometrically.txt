Get to know the image you'll be creating.
Make a given finite blue horizontal line of unit length = 1, and treating each endpoint as the center of a radius, make two overlapping circles.

,
Connect the endpoints of the original line (radius) from either side with the intersection point of the two circles.
Drop the connecting perpendicular between the top intersection point of the two circles and the bottom intersection point of the two circles.
Do the math.
The black line equals the square root of 3 relative to the radius of 1 between 0 and +1 on the x axis.

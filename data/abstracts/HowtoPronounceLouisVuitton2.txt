Say “Lwee.” Saying "Louis Vuitton" with its real French pronunciation is a little trickier than saying it in its English form.
Say “Vwee.” Unlike in English, the U in "Vuitton" isn't silent in French.
Say “Toh.” In French, the "-on" ending, with very few exceptions, has a silent "N" sound.
Put it all together!,
For perfect pronunciation, use a French “ou” sound.

Camping works.
Never go to the same spot the next round unless you are sure you can handle yourself.

,
Camp with silenced guns like MP5, P90, Ak-47, M4 Carbine, or Ak-74u.
After you have planted the bomb at A or B find a good spot to camp and watch the bomb.
When you are the last man left, don't be afraid.
If you are the only one left alive from both teams and you have to defuse the bomb.
Don't Be afraid to use C4.
Grenade Tubes (or Noob Tubes) WORK!

Check your recipe to find out whether to measure the sugar before or after sifting.
Use the widest bowl you can find.
Pour a small amount of sugar into a sifter or strainer.
Gently shake the sifter or operate its crank.
Tap the sides if the sugar is stuck.
Add more sugar until all of it is sifted, throwing away lumps if necessary.
Know when sifting is optional.

Tricks are performed after boosting off from the ground and into the air.
Simply race to a ramp, half-pipe, speed booster or any other thing on the track that allows you to boost off the ground.
As soon as you jump off from the ramp, half-pipe, or boost, shake the Wii Remote.
Once you successfully pull off a trick, you will land on the ground and have a speed boost once touching the ground.

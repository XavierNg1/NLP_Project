Grab the moment.
In order to get in touch with our inner child, we have to rediscover our childhood.
We have to take time to enjoy the moments that were special in our youth and pass them unto our heirs.
Keep the memories close.
Watch old movies.
Give 3 hours a week and receive a lifetime of memories.

Begin with a general exponential function.
Take the natural logarithm of both sides.
Eliminate the exponent.
Differentiate both sides and simplify.
Simplify to solve for the derivative.
Interpret the final result.
Choose the special example.
Use the proof of the general exponential function derivative.
Simplify the result.
Interpret the final result.
Define your function.
Define the variable u{\displaystyle u}.
Apply the chain rule.
Practice another example of e{\displaystyle e} with a functional exponent.
Define the function.
Find the natural logarithm of each side.
Take the derivative of each side of the equation.
Multiply each side by y. Isolate the derivative term on the right by multiplying both sides of the equation by y.1ydydx=1+ln⁡x{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{y}}{\frac {dy}{dx}}=1+\ln x}


dydx=y∗(1+ln⁡x){\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}=y*(1+\ln x)}


,
Replace the original value of y.

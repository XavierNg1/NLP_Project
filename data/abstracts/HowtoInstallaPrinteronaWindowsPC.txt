If you're not sure what flavor of Windows your PC is running,


click on the Start button, and right-click on the "Computer" menu.
On the pop-up menu (the Start Menu), click on Devices and Printers.
You're going to get a dialog that looks like the picture at right.
A menu pops up, asking whether you want to add a Local Printer, or to add a Network Printer.
Next, a box opens to ask whether you want to use an existing port, or create a new one.
On the next screen, you select how you're going to install the printer software, called the Printer Driver.

For every turn a player must play a card face up to the middle of the table.
During a turn the card you play must beat the previous card played by the person before you.
Two's and Ten's are special cards in the game where Two's are reset cards and Ten's are clear cards.
Once the deck is depleted and you are out of cards in your hand you then start playing from the 3 face up cards in front of you.
If you get rid of all your cards then you win!

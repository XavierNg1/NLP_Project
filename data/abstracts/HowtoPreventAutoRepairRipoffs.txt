Find a trustworthy mechanic before you actually need one so that you won't be pressed into locating one in a hurry if your car suddenly breaks down.
Trust your instinct.
Prevent rip-offs by contacting the Better Business Bureau, AAA (American Automobile Association) and the Consumer Affairs Office in your city or state.
Look for shops with an ASE symbol on the sign, which indicates the shop met the criteria for Automotive Service Excellence.
Be familiar with your vehicle.
Ask if the shop has experience dealing with your type of car.
Make a checklist of what work your vehicle needs.
Get an itemized written estimate in advance and be sure the mechanic contacts you before doing any work that exceeds the original estimate.
Request a detailed invoice that includes costs of labor and parts.

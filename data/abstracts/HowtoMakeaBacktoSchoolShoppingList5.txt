You'll need to look for a good skin care brand.
Next is your body care.
For hair care, find a good shampoo, conditioner, leave-in conditioner, and any other products you use.
Make sure to wash your face each night, and if you want, gently cleanse it each morning to keep it extra clean, but make a routine so you don't over-wash. Also brush and floss teeth every day, being sure to use floss!

Gather the laundry that needs to be washed and bleached, including your shirt.
Set your washer to the correct wash cycle and temperature and turn it on.
Add laundry detergent to the water.
Measure Â½ cup of bleach and either pour it directly into the bubbly water or into the bleach dispenser on your washer.Be sure to do this before you add the clothes, because pouring it in after you add the clothes could cause bleach spots in clothing that is not white.
Put your shirt and other laundry in the wash and close the washer lid.
Pull your shirt from the washer at the end of the cycle and examine it.

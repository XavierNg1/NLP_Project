Prepare your sewing machine.
Wash the shower curtain, unless it's new.
Measure and cut the shower curtain 55" (140cm) wide by its existing length (about 67" in this case).
Cut away any seams.

,
Cut a 12" (30.5cm) slit in the exact center of the curtain, parallel to where the seam was (the side that's 55").
Fold the piece you set aside earlier in half.

,
Draw a hood starting from the folded edge and cut it out.
Sew along the curved edge.
Cut a 2" slit in the middle of one side of the head hole (perpendicular to the line).

,
Fold the flaps under and pin them down to make the front neck opening of the poncho.
Sew the hood on and you're done!

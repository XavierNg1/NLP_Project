Remove the screen from the metal insert frame.
,

Cut a section of new screen that fits over the frame.


Cut four rubber splines.

Center the screen on the frame as best you can.

Grab a matching spline piece.

Add more glue further down the groove, and press the spline further into the groove.

When the spline is all glued in, lay a bead of glue on top of the spline, all the way back.Repeat for each adjacent side (it can be helpful to go counterclockwise).

Use the Exacto knife to trim excess screen material.

All done!,

Be aware that it won't last forever.

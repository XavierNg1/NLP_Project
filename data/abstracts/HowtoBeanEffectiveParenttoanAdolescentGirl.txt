Love your daughter.
Listen to your daughter.
Make it easier for your daughter to listen:


Sometimes approaching her with a written letter given in person is a persuasive method of getting her to 'listen' to what you have to say.
Call in a mentor if needed.
Encourage your daughter's social life in a positive fashion.
Be a role model.
Interact sensitively.
If you need to demonstrate sympathy for her, be genuine.
Give your daughter choices whenever possible.
Although give her her space, she still needs your guidance and attention.
Remember that although your daughter may be as tall or taller than you, and looks like a woman, her brain is not completely grown.

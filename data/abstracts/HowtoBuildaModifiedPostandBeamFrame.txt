Build upon a sturdy foundation.
Erect your posts; about 10' apart, in a grid.
Get your posts plumb.
Choose the right dimension boards for your beams.
Decide your beam height.
Attach your 2x6 cleats vertically to the posts.
Raise your first horizontal board for the beam.
Use rope to raise the board if the beam placement is high, and the board is very heavy.
Fasten the board.
Do the same on the other side of the posts - 2 more cleats, and another horizontal board.
Put in studs to help support the beam if you have a perimeter stem wall.
Notch out the top of the studs so they interlock with the boards in the beams.
Continue framing around the corner, with cleats, parallel boards for beams, and doubled studs if possible.
Follow this framing pattern throughout the perimeter.
Run 2x6 bracing in the opposite direction of your beams.
Make sure the center posts look like this, with 2x6 bracing run underneath the beams, all of it tied together with fasteners and metal angles.
Tie the 2x6 bracing into the perimeter framing like this:

,
Continue to work square by square .
Place an X-frame over a garage or barn doors to support the weight.
Follow the same techniques of cleats, beams, and blocking, until the majority of the structure is stabilized.
Put in the joists, once the frame is finished.

Start the game by passing your highest cards.
Begin playing, following suit when you can.
If you lead a trick, try to play a card that is likely to be beaten.
If you don't lead a trick, follow suit with a card lower than the lead card.
Try to "short-suit" yourself.
Only try to shoot the moon when you have a reasonable chance of doing so.

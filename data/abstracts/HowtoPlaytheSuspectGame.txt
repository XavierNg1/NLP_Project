Have at least 3 people for this game to work properly.
Choose your people's roles.
Choose your rooms.Start by having your suspect(s) go in to the suspect's house.
Then, have them lean against the door.
Next, outside their door, the police officer should say "attending scene".Then the police officer should bang hard on the suspect's door.
At this time, the suspect(s) can either choose to open the door right away, but this can be less fun.
To force the door open, push hard and open the door normally at the same time.
So you've got the door open some way or another.
Take them to your designated jail, and shut them in it.Now, it's the suspect(s) time to plot how to get out of jail.
Have your suspect(s) make noises like they're sick and then pretend that they have fainted on the floor.
If you don't want to do that one, you can just try to get out of the jail room.Each time your suspect(s) escape(s), catch them and put them back in jail.
In about 15 minutes, come and get them for their court case.
Swap roles.

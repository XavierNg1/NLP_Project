Move with the ball.
Talk.
Stay in front of your opponent.
Move the line.
When attempting to do sliding tackles, proceed with caution; if you miss, you will leave your defense open.
When coming to your opponent make sure that you are ready to stop the ball from any direction.
Expect a pass.
Practice changing direction.
When passed by an opponent with the ball always continue defending, because your laying back can lead to a goal being scored.

,
Be fast.
Prevent goal access:


If your opponent receives the ball, stay in front of him as he turns his body toward the goal.
Defend instead of reaching in.
Use your team support.
Guessing your opponent's next move is useful, but what's better is to know the various moves available for your opponent and be ready to respond to prevent him/her from using any of those.

,
Be aggressive and intimidating legally.
Watch your opponent.
Contain as best as you can.
Know the speed and abilities of the opposing players.
Occasionally glance instantly around.
Use deception.
Watch how the ball is being carried.
Stay between your player and the goal.
Wait until the player makes a mistake.
If your player gets by you and is one on one with the goalie, stay in close pursuit trying to get in front and in case they make a mistake, just being there will put pressure on them.
Always think one move ahead.

Note that there are three main ingredients needed in equal parts:


1.
Boil the potatoes, heating them from cold water in a pan.
Add the gram flour.

,
Sweat the onions and pre-cook any vegetables that may need it.
Add water and mix by hand until the mixture starts to be liquid enough to just start to fall off a spoon on its own.

,
Bring a wok or pan full with vegetable oil to 180ÂºC, ready to deep fry the pakora.
Serve hot or allow to cool for a delicious snack.

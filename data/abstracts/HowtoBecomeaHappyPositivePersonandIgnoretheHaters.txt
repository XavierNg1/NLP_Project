Breathe and relax!,
Know that you matter.
Make a list and focus on the good points in your life.
Remember that you are never alone!,
Don't let those rude people get you down.Don't let someone ruin something that is important to you

,
Fight on.
Just think if you don't ask you don't get.
Can you bare to share a smile - honestly it won't kill you!

,
Ask someone if they're okay.
Just think it's not forever and if the worst comes to it just think: however long I won't have to see this person again.

,
Don't let anyone ever tell you that your best isn't good enough.

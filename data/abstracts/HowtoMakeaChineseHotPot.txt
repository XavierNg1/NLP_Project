Prepare a broth in a large pot or wok that will be used to cook the hot pot ingredients.
Slice a variety of meats and fish thinly to be cooked in the hot pot.
Select and prepare some vegetables.
Have enough noodles for all of your guests alongside the hot pot to eat with their selections as a side dish, or simply use the broth to cook the noodles at the end of the meal.
Add other ingredients if desired.
Place a variety of condiments on the table where you are dining and encourage your guests to create their own sauce to dip their ingredients.
Transfer your broth, omitting any solids, into a wok, clay pot or any pot that is wide and shallow so that everyone will be able to easily dip their ingredients into it.
Try to arrange the seating so that everyone is sitting in a circle and has easy access to everything on the table.
Enjoy!

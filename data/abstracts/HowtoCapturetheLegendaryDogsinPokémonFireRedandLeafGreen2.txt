Test the high grasses around Kanto.
Purchase 10-20 Max Repels.
Chose a Pokémon level 49 or lower as your starter.
Walk through the grass for 10-20 seconds to search for the dogs.
Walk indoors or into a new region if you cannot find the dog.
Repeat this process of adding repel, checking the grass, and resetting location until you see the dog.
Use your Pokédex to find the dogs again if you miss your chance.

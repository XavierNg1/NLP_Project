Use your common sense and intuition.Some of your best lie detection tools are your mind and heart; Listen to what they are telling you.
Use past experience.
Use logic and reason.
Think about what this person has to gain or lose.How will lying to you benefit them?,
Ask for details about what they are telling you.
Ask them to repeat what they previously said.
Ask different variations of the same question.
Keep asking questions.The deeper into the lie they get, the harder it will be for them to make up information and stick to it.This will also lead to them panicking, therefore giving off vital clues to their deception.
Ask them if they are lying in a non-accusatory way.
Listen to their words.Listen closely to what they are saying and think about what they are telling you.
Listen to how they sound.Lying can be stressful and as a result people often have a different pitch, cadence, or may stutter when they are lying.
Notice if they change the subject.
Look at general body language.
Look at their hands.People often unconsciously make small movements with their hands when they are lying.
Observe their eyes.People often donâ€™t realize just how expressive their eyes are.
Study their face.Just like with the eyes, people are often not aware of the small unconscious movements in their face.

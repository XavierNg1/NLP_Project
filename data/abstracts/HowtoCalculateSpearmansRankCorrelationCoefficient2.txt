Draw your data table.
Fill in the first two columns with your pairs of data.

,
In your third column rank the data in your first column from 1 to n (the number of data you have).
In your fourth column do the same as in step 3, but instead rank the second column.
In the "d" column calculate the difference between the two numbers in each pair of ranks.
Square each of the numbers in the "d" column and write these values in the "d2" column.

,
Add up all the data in the "d2" column.
Choose one of these formulae:

If there was no tie in previous steps, insert this value into the simplified Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient formula





and replace the "n" with the number of pairs of data you have to calculate the answer.
Interpret your result.

Consider painting the bottle caps a different color.
Change the design of the cap using scrapbook paper and Mod Podge.
Fill the inside with epoxy or clear, dimensional paint/glaze.
Punch a second hole into the bottom of your bottle cap to add some dangly bits.
Consider removing the plastic liner inside the bottle cap.

Avoid luxury ingredients, the things that used to be precious (because they required extraordinary resources).
Eat proteins that "save" water and don't eat more than you need.
Drink water instead of anything else.
Reduce your grains and/or substitute vegetable starches (like potatoes).
Fill up with fresh fruits and vegetables!,
Calcium builds bones, and many vegetables contain good amounts of calcium.

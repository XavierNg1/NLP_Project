Diabetes mellitus is an endocrine disorder of the pancreatic tissue which is manifested as deficient secretion of the hormone insulin by the islet cells of Langerhans which are parts of the pancreas.
Glucose is a type of sugar that is required by the body cells in order to generate energetic molecules that are called ATP.
All these processes occur within the liver cells that are called hepatocytes.
This polar structure does not allow this compound to penetrate the phospholipid bilayer of the liver cells freely.
One is due to a genetic defect in the coding process of the hormone translational process at the DNA molecule or it can be due to an autoimmune disorder that causes the destruction of the islet cells of langerhans by circulating auto antibodies in the blood.
The destruction of the islet cells of langerhans by the circulating antibodies causes permanent destruction of the islet cells with no possibility of regeneration of the function of the pancreas.
This type of Diabetes Mellitus can be treated by increasing the responsiveness of the receptors of insulin at the cellular membranes of hepatocytes.
The immediate and most convenient molecules that can serve as an alternative fuel to glucose are the class of fatty acids that are present in the blood.
Their structure is mostly hydrophobic which allow them to easily penetrate the cellular membrane of hepatocytes.
An immediate consequence to the use of fatty acids as a source of fuel instead of glucose is the formation of ketones in the blood as metabolic products of the oxidation of fatty acids.

These ketones are of the type of ketonic acids that can be passed in the urine giving it acetone like smell.

Respect everyone you meet even if they give you a reason not too; try hard to not make any enemies and think before you speak.
Use the morals that your parents taught you wisely.
Hang out with your friends every other weekend and hang with your family the remaining weekends.
Read a book every once in a while and try your hardest at school.

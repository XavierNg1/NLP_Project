Decide on how big the chest of drawers is going to be and how many drawers will it have.
Assemble the bottom panel.
Attach the metal slides for the drawers to the two side panels of the chest.
Place the bottom panel on the floor, apply glue to the inside of the left and right strips.
Add the second side and attach, as you did for the other side panel to finally give you a chest carcass with the four sides.
Attach molding to the edge of the chest as shown with glue and nails.
Prepare the four sides for each drawer, and attach them together with glue and a screw going in from one face into the edge of the plywood like a frame.
Attach the drawer slides to the bottom of these drawers and then slide them in.

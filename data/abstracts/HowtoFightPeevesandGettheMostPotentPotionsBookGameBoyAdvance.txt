On the 2nd floor of Hogwarts, go into Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.
Go in.
Make sure that the spell you are equipped with at that moment is 'Flipendo'.
Something you should know about Flipendo is it has two functions.
Do this for all of them; then it will just be you and Peeves.
When he clears off, a book drops.
By this time in the game, you have already snuck around Filch and found the Marauder's Map of Hogwarts, right?

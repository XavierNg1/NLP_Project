Ensure you have a very large pasta pot.
Pour five to six quarts (4.7 to 5.6l) of water into your stockpot for each pound (0.4kg) of spaghetti.
Add one tablespoon (18g) of salt to the water as the water comes to a boil.
Don’t add oil to the water.
Stir your pasta within one to two minutes of adding it to the pot.
Keep the cover off the pot, so that it cooks evenly and doesn’t boil over.

,
Test your spaghetti two minutes before the timer rings.
Drain the spaghetti immediately when it is ready.
Don’t rinse your spaghetti.
Toss it with warm sauce immediately after you drain it.

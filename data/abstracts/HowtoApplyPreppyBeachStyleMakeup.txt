Think of Amanda Seyfried in "Dear John".
Now that you have guidelines from beachy celebrities, get started on your actual look!,
If you want to use foundation spread it lightly over your face and neck with clean fingers.
Take the eyeliner and apply it to your bottom lash line.
Dip your index finger in the eyeshadow and gently spread it over your eyelid.
Take a loose blush/powder in a very lively color (peach, rose, salmon).
Apply an unscented lip balm to your lips.
When you wear mascara wear a rich, cappuccino shade for light brown-platinum blond hair, and a soft, mocha shade for black-dark blond hair.
Finished.

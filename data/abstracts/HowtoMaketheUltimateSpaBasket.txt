Gather your supplies.
Purchase the basket after the goodies.
Purchase the items needed to help create the basket.
Consider color coordinating the basket.
Lay down tissue paper to cover the bottom and sides and let it run up over the rim.
Lay a folded towel inside the basket to the side to provide that artistic flourish.
Place all of the other items you've purchased inside the basket where they look nice and neat.
Tie some scented items with ribbon and place on top.
Wrap the whole basket in cellophane (or plastic wrap).
Add a bow and you are done!

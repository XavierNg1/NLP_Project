Clean your golf club around the grip area.
Set up a vice to hold your club throughout the process.
Place your club horizontally in the vice somewhere in the middle and lock it in.
Spread some cloth or paper under the the club to keep your floor clean.
Use a utility knife to make a clean cut lengthwise all the way through the grip, just touching the tape underneath.Be careful not to cut deep into the actual shaft.

,
Pry open the grip where you made the cut and peel back the old grip using a screwdriver or your fingers.
Dribble some grip solvent into the cut area before peeling if you have to.
Remove the tape on the shaft.
Tape the same area with double-sided tape.
Apply grip solvent liberally all over the new tape.
Take your new grip and pour grip solvent into it.
Slide the new grip onto the shaft.
Align the grip how you want it before the glue on the inside of the grip has a chance to set.
Leave the grip to dry for a full day.

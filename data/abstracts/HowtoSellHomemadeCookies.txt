Bake the cookies, tasting one from each batch to make sure they taste like they are supposed to.
Any burnt cookies should not be sold.
Place a good amount of cookies in a clean, home decorated jar.
Change up your inventory so returning customers have new merchandise to choose from.
Set a fair price for the cookies, and stick to it.

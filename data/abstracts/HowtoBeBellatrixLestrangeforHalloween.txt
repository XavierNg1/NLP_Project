Make/Purchase a wand.
Make or thrift a long, black skirt.
Buy a long-sleeved black shirt.
Alternatively, you could cut the sleeves to elbow length and do a Dark Mark design on your arm using either Sharpies/Henna/Black Eyeliner etc.

,
Get a large piece of either black vinyl, leather, or other similar material or fabric -- as long as it's thick, black and sturdy, it'll be fine.
Wear fishnets.
Buy press-on nails, and file them to a point (not an ACTUAL one; leave them rounded off enough at the top).
As for your hair: If you're getting a wig, get a standard Cher or Snookie style wig in black (can be curly, but doesn't have to be).
Makeup: Do NOT put on a whole bunch of black makeup -- you're dressing as Bellatrix, not as Elvira.
Other additions you could to for the costume are wearing a push-up bra to maximize your assets, 'dirty' up your Halloween costume for a more "escaped-from-Azkaban" look.

Finding a job sounds like a hard thing to do only when one is not willing to do so.
The will to change things in order to make more money is a must.
If driving a gas hog, getting something smaller is recommended.
It is hard to understand the point of wearing brand clothes if they can cost up to three times more than just regular clothing.
Try to find a job in a restaurant, especially in a buffet place.
An employee working at a restaurant can get between $50 and $65 on weekdays, and Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, he/she earns about $80 to $100 a day.
Don't go out to eat unless it is really necessary!,
Not buying a brand new car and dressing cheaper doesn't make somebody worth less than another person.

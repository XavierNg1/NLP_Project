Set up a rewards program.
Leave the pacifier in the bed, as it is an aid to sleep.
Never let the baby walk around with a pacifier in his mouth -- the baby is in the beginning stages of speech when they are walking and a pacifier can interfere with their ability to communicate.

Another trick is to cut the nipple of the pacifier and the baby won't like it as much.
Simply take it away.
Use an older child as an example.
Inform the child that there are other children that need binkies that are just being born.
Propose a trade of a toy for a pacifier.

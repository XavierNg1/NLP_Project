Purchase your landscape timbers, steel rod (rebar), and landscape spikes (giant nails).
Start with the lowest elevation for building your retaining wall.
Anchor the row into the ground.
Begin the edge walls.
Start the other edge wall the same way, at the opposite corner of the bottom row.

,
Build up the main wall with another row of timbers, staggered over the joints - slightly less than 12' this time, because run between the ends of your edge rows.
Run another row along the main wall above this, the full 12', overlapping your edge rows.
Do more rows along the edges, again starting at the corner and running each timber until it terminates below grade.
Build up this way until your retaining wall is as high as you need.
Remove the sod from the pad area, and begin filling with dirt.
Use the narrow edge of a board with a level on it to check your grade as you build up.
Allow the new fill exposure to the weather for a while, if possible.
Place your structure on the new grade.
Put down a layer of pea gravel, and tamp it gently.
Furnish and enjoy your new piece of living space!

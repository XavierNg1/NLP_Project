First (assuming this is an outdoor Nerf war), check out your surrounding area.
Get these things between you and the direction the enemy will approach from.
If you haven't been spotted by the enemy yet, stay quiet.
If you have been spotted, try to make them think that you are ready for their attack and that there are more of you than there actually are.
Set traps.

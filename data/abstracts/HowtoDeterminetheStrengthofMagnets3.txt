Calculate the baseline or original voltage.
Touch the meter's sensor to one of the magnet's poles.
Record the new voltage.
Find the difference between the original and the new voltage.
Divide the result by the sensitivity value of the sensor.
Repeat to test the field strength at varying distances from the magnet.

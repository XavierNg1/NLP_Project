Empty your shelf.
Decide how to categorize.
If you have a lot of CDs make a couple of piles,so you can go through them pile by pile, instead of one giant mass of cluttered mess!

,
Pile number one.
Do it again!,
If you come across any CDs you've never heard of, or don't listen to any more, put them in a pile to give away to charity, or for a garage sale.

,
Re-shelve.
Done!

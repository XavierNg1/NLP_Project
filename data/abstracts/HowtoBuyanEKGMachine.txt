Evaluating the existing EKG machine in the office: it's on its last legs, but you decided to wait until it was broken beyond repair.
Find the product you need, by shopping around:


Allow yourself time to shop the internet for an EKG machine; do not trust your local rep just because of having dealt with him or her for years.
Realize you will receive service when you purchase over the internet, as most EKG manufacturers have authorized service representatives in each area of the country.
Expect your local rep to have a role in selling you supplies, although you should periodically check the prices they are offering.

Use your highest lofted club (60 degree wedge is ideal).
Execution: The length of your swing will be in proportion to the distance you need to hit the shot, but in general, this stroke needs to feel long and smooth (as opposed to sudden or quick).
The pace of your swing should be constant.
Keep the clubface open throughout the swing.
Swing left (if you are a right-hander).

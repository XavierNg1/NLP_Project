Decide what color tiles you are going to use.
Decide If you want the grout to blend in with or stand out from the tiles.
If you want the grout to blend in with the tile so the tile pattern is less visible, choose a grout color that is close to the color of the tile.
If you want the grout to stand out from the tile so the tile pattern is more visible, think of colors that contrast your tiles.
Install the grout according to the manufacturer's instructions.

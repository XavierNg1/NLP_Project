Do personal research.
Decide how you feel about shunning and the announcement: "So-and-so is not one of Jehovah's Witnesses.",
If you want to avoid being shunned, continue to live as one of Jehovah's Witnesses while slowly fading.
If you are not concerned about shunning, simply stop attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall and carry on your life in the manner that reflects your true beliefs.

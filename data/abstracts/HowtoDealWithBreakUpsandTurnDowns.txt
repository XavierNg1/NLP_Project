The day that you get turned down, take a bath with some pretty scented flower petals such as rose petals or daisy petals.
Try to get over him or her!,
Know that friends are there to help you.
Get confident.
Go and relax life will move on just because one guy/girl doesn't want to be with you doesn't mean that other wonderful people don't either.

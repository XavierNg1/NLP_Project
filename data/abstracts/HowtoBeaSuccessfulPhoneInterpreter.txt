Have a phone line just for interpreting purpose only.
Create a quiet, organized working space.
As you interpret, write down certain information because you might be asked to repeat back to clarify what was stated.
Interpret verbatim but keep in mind that in certain languages, the word-for-word approach ends up confusing and nonsensical.
Don't assume, guess, or have preconceived notions about people or issues being interpreted.
Always be courteous, neutral, and calm regardless of attitudes of other parties involved in the interpreting process.
Continually educate yourself.
Maintain good working relationships with interpreting agencies.

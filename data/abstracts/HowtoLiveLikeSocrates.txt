If you truly wish to live like Socrates, then you need to devote yourself entirely to philosophy and searching for the truth.
Make sure where you debate with others is in a public area.
Never be afraid to voice what you think, or more importantly the truth.
Never fear death.
Show humility.
Remember the Socratic paradoxes.
Stick to your principles even in face of death, as Socrates did, as described in Phaedo.
Be sure to "know thyself".
Meet distinguished or influential people.
Remember that truth is the most important thing ever and you must do all you can to find it.

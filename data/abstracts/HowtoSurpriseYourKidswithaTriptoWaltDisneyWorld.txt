Prepare yourself for several methods.
Gather your children.
Sit your children down on a soft surface such as a sofa/love seat or soft chair.
Have them try to explain the meaning of some of the special Disney-esque pieces you should have nearby.
Have them go on a scavenger hunt around the house.
Tell your children a few fibs about their next plane ride, if you know they can't read that well yet.
Use alphabetical refrigerator magnets to post a quick message on your refrigerator spelling "We're going to Disney World.",
Purchase a customizable/personalized create-your-own jigsaw puzzle.
Fill your home with items set in a "Hidden Mickey" type of style/pattern.
Have the kids pre-program your GPS device by the digital location to the Walt Disney World park.
Have your children check the gate assignment on your most recent tickets.

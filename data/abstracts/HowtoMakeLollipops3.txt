Preheat your oven to 275°F (135°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Unwrap the Jolly Ranchers, and arrange them side-by-side in small groups on the parchment paper.
Bake the Jolly Ranchers for 5 to 7 minutes, or until they melt.
Take the Jolly Ranchers out of the oven, then insert the lollipop sticks.
Let the lollipops cool and harden.

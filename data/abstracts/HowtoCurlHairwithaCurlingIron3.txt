Grab one section of hair to curl.
Squeeze the curling iron open and place it near the bottom of a section of hair.
Clamp the curling iron shut and twist it so that the hair spirals around it.
Hold the hair inside the iron for approximately 10 seconds.
Loosen your hair and repeat on the next section.
Finished.

Define the equation to solve for surface tension.
Construct a small balance beam.In this experiment, you will use a balance beam and a small needle floating on the surface of water to measure surface tension.
Fold a piece of aluminum foil to form a box or dish.
Hang a needle or paper clip horizontally from the other end of the beam with thread.
Place a piece of material such as clay on the beam to counterbalance the aluminum container.
Place the needle or paper clip hanging from the beam into a container of water.
Weigh a batch of pins or several measured drops of water on a small postal scale.
Add the pins or drops of water one at a time to your aluminum foil container until the needle is freed from the water's surface.
Convert the measurement of pins into force by multiplying the number of grams by 0.00981 N/g.
Plug the variables into the equation and solve.

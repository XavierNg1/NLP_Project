Get your Tamagotchi.
Watch for an egg to pop up on the screen.

,
Press the middle button and set the time, date etc.
Get ready for a baby Tamagotchi.
Keep up the care.
If you see little squiggles next to your Tamagotchi, and it has a "determined" face on, he's sideways, and he's moving back and forth, he's ready to make a mess.
Check back every 15 minutes, or put it on PAUSE (press A and B button to pause or unpause) until you have time to play again.
After you take care of your baby, it will go into a 5 minute sleep.
In a couple of days, your child will turn into a teenager!,
And, after that, your teen will turn into an adult!,
Once your Tamagotchi grows up, he will want to have a baby (You got that right, your pet will have a baby if you want!).
Once you spend 48 hours with your Tamagotchi and it's baby, the parent will leave while you and the baby are asleep.
and GEN: (number), you will see that next to GEN, the number will have increased by one!,
If your Tamagotchi dies, it will be because you neglected your Tamagotchi.
Good luck with your Tamagotchi!

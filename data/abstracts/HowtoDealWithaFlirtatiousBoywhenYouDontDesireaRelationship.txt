Be calm at first and assess the situation.
If this boy is a flirt but is flirting more excessively with you than anyone else, be on the cautious side.
If you don't want to have a relationship, you should try to make it clear first off.
Try not to be caught alone when he may bother you.
Keep in mind that while the above mentioned steps will help, they are not guaranteed to stop him.
The worst just may happen.
If you are meeting in person, you have no choice but to immediately respond.
If the encounter happens on Facebook/email or over the phone, you have time and are lucky.
It's most likely that after this, you and the boy will avoid each other.

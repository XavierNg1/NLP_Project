First and foremost, determine if you have enough space and the appropriate funds to build this small addition to your home.
If you've gotten permission to build and have the appropriate space and funds, hire a contractor to begin constructing the foundation, frame, walls, and roof.
Once the main oval building is constructed, start by installing three large, long windows in the front center and a smaller window of the same style several feet to the left.

,
Install the doors that lead into and out of the Oval Office.
Build a slightly large white marble fireplace in the back center of the room.
Have two bookcases built into the right center wall, between the large wooden door.
Have the contractor carve a medallion of the presidential seal into the center of the ceiling, surrounded by small stars, and have an electrician install recessed lighting around it.

,
Paint the room and ceiling a creamy tan color.
If you haven't done so already, hire an electrician to install the light fixtures.

,
Now you'll be able to begin decorating.
Order a large custom rug for the floor.
Purchase all the furniture, artwork and other items you will need to decorate your home Oval Office.
Find long, thick draperies for the three windows behind the desk.
You should be all set!

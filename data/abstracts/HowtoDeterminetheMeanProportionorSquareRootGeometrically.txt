Understand the terms.
Scale up your numbers.
Choose factors a and b of 6096 as a=127, b=48 and center = (127+48)/2= 87.5; that's perfectly acceptable.
Describe the semicircle above labeled points a,b and c of line ac containing the segments ab and bc equaling 127 and 48 respectively.

,
Draw line "BD" at right angles to line ac up to intersect the circle at point d. Join lines ad and dc.

,
At point d, write "d/M" and at point b. change it to read "b/P" where "MP" means "Mean Proportional".

,
Now since angle "ADC" is an angle in a semicircle, it is right.Final Image

Start with slightly damp, but not wet, hair.
Make sure that your hair is tangle-free and parted how you want it to be.
Place a thin, stretchy headband over your hair and around your head.
Gather a small section of hair from the front of your head.
Twist the section away from your face and tuck it under the headband.
Pick the section up again and gather some more hair.
Wrap the now-thicker section once around the headband.
Keep going until you reach the back of your head, then repeat the process for the other side.
Twist the remaining hair into a rope.
Adjust the headband if necessary.
Remove the headband in the morning and style your hair.

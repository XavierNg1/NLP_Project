Be aware of strategies to prevent dry skin.
Clean your face quickly and less thoroughly than you normally do.
Be careful with baths and showers.
Use lots of moisturizing creams or lotions.As soon as you get out of the bath, gently pat your skin dry (do not vigorously rub) as this helps to preserve as much of the natural moisture in your skin.
Avoid picking or scratching at any areas of cracked skin on your face.Although it can be tempting to pick or scratch at it, especially if your skin gets scaly or red, this can worsen the cycle and actually cause more damage to your skin.

Stay well-hydrated.It is important to drink at least 8 cups of water daily, and more if you are doing exercise to compensate for fluid lost in sweat.
Know when to see a doctor.If your skin does not show improvement after two weeks of treatment with a combination of moisturizers and the above treatments, it is best to seek the advice of a medical professional.

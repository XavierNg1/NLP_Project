Recognize if your bike's wheels are measured by the International Organization for Standardization system instead of the standard method.
Ensure the bike is propped up against the wall or on its kickstand.
Measure the tire's width in millimeters.
Remember when purchasing a new tire measured by the ISO system, the width is listed first, followed by the diameter.

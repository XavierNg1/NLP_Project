Digitize your library.Before you give away your physical collection it is a good idea to create a digital backup.
Set aside rare collectible items.
Burn material to your CDs.If you have blank or rewritable CDs, you can effectively reuse them by replacing the material that's on the discs.
Sell off your collection.Whether via social media like Facebook or message board sites like Craigslist, it's a common thing for people to sell their collections to interested buyers.
Gift your collection to friends.
Get in touch with a media resale broker.Even if it seems like a lot of people are trying to get rid of their collections, there's still a large market for the purchase of CDs and DVDs.
Dispose of your CDs at a recycling center.Because there are so many people looking to get rid of their collections, and because discs aren't biodegradable, there are lots of recycling centers that specialize in processing unwanted CDs and DVDs.

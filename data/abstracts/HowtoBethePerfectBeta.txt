Pick a leader.
After you pick your leader, you need to find loyal subjects.
Make sure you have a range of people.
Always follow your leader's directions.
Be obedient and efficient.
Be the second prettiest girl in the clique.
Never flirt with the leader's crush, boyfriend, or brother.
Give her space!,
Be yourself.
Above all: Be loyal.

Find or assemble a grooming kit.
Begin by using the currycomb.
Use the brushes to remove the grime that you worked out of the coat with the currycomb.
Using a very gentle brush or face cloth, carefully brush around your horse's face, being certain not to irritate his eyes or nose.

,
Pick out your horse's feet.
Stand at your horse's head and gently comb out his mane and forelock (the little bit of mane that goes between his ears).
Standing at the side of the horse and facing his tail, gently pull his tail over towards you and comb it out, as well.
Put away your grooming kit, clean and sweep up your grooming area tack up, mount up, and get started with your lesson.

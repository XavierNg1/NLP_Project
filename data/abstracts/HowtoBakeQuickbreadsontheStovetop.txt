Pick a biscuit or scone recipe and prepare it, but don't preheat the oven; we won't be using it.

Cover your quickbread with an inverted Pyrex bowl, a molcajete, or other heat-tolerant dome that can hold in the heat.

Flip the quickbread; this is unfortunately necessary as the inverted bowl cannot equal an oven for surrounding your food with heat.

Break your biscuit or scone in half; if it's done, enjoy.

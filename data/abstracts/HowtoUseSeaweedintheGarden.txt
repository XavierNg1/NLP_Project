Collect the seaweed from your local beach or waterway.
When you get home, be sure to wash sand and beach debris off the seaweed for the sand and beach debris is very alkaline.
Choose what you want to use your seaweed for.
If using it in the compost, be sure to mix it through with other materials really well.
To make your seaweed into a liquid fertiliser, simply put all the compost in a barrel or any other sort of container.
If you choose to use the seaweed directly on the garden, it's imperative that you do so correctly.

Wear a bright, chunky necklace with neutral colors.
Pair less elaborate necklaces (such as a long silver or gold chain) with eye-catching clothes.
Always wear a large pearl or diamond necklace with elegant clothing.
Bib necklaces should be worn with high-cut but low-collared shirts and jackets.
Donâ€™t wear more than one big necklace at once.
Be cautious of sloppily made, cheap-looking necklaces.

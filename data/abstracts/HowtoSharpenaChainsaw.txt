Determine the size (or "gauge") of your saw's chain.
Clean the chain thoroughly.
Inspect the chain for damaged or overly worn links and teeth.
Set your saw on a solid surface or clamp the bar in a vise.
Locate the leading cutter as your starting point.
Set your file in the notch on the front of the cutter.
Hold the file at the same angle that the cutter was ground or filed to begin with.
Slide the file across the face of the cutter, using a moderate twisting motion to discharge metal chips (filings) that are removed.
Work every second tooth identically from your beginning point around the loop.
Reverse sides of the saw and proceed around the unfiled teeth angled in the other direction.
Check the clearance of the rakers (depth gauge), the curved hook shaped links between the cutters.
File any raker/depth gauge that interferes with the cutter (in other words, that sits too high) using a flat mill bastard file (not likely to be needed except when dealing with a defective chain).








,
Oil your chain (saturate/soak with oil), check the tension, and you should be ready to cut once again.

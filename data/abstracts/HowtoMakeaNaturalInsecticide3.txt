Grow perennial painted daisies in your garden so you have the main insecticide ingredient -- pyrethrins, which degrade quickly.
Apply on your plants using an insecticide duster.
Spray the upper and lower parts of the leaves on your plants because the pyrethrins must come in contact with the insects.

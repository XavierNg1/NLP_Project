Don't even try to earn Christ's love.
Be thankful!,
Talk to God: Talk to the One who's always around.
Ask for the Holy Spirit Â : because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
Trust God; have faith.
Be the person that you believe God created you to be.
Get this: God loves everyone and will accept you no matter what you have done or will do in life.
Understand the nature of God by living your life by the Bible--that's the only way.
Don't expect to get some kind of "blessing" that will solve all your problems.
Most importantly, watch and listen for the leading of the Holy Spirit.
Attending church is great but even church organizations need people to help others: you can help strangers, family, friends, organizations, youth services, Sunday school: volunteer to help.

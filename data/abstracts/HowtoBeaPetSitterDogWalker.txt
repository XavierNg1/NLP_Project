First of all, think of a name for your pet sitting/dog walking business.
Decide how much you're going to charge for what service.
Put yourself out there to the world!,
Once you've made up your posters, put them around in as many places as possible.
If you want to attract even more business, make business cards and hand them out to friends/family/neighbors.
Once you get your first customer, be friendly to them and do a good job with their pets.
After doing all of these steps, your pet sitting/dog walking business should really get off of the ground!

Carry your bag in front of you and low to the ground as you walk down the aisle in search of your seat.
Utilize the overhead space above your own seat row.
Avoid hogging the aisle.
Take care when retrieving luggage from the overhead compartment!,
Keep your chair upright at least until you're told it can be reclined.
Check behind you—is that person tall, or do they have a child on their lap?,
If you're a tall/big person or have a child on your lap and know that having the seat in front of you reclined will make you uncomfortable, choose a bulkhead or exit row seat (unless you have a child, in which case you should never choose an exit row seat).
If you are traveling with one or more children, keep a close eye on them.
If another passenger breaches etiquette by, for example, constantly thumping or yanking your seat back, and refuses your polite request not to do so, don't get any further involved.
Avoid grabbing the back of the seat in front of you.
No matter how much you love to make new friends on the plane, the person next to you might rather get some work done, or simply may not feel like being chatty.
If you want to watch a movie on your personal DVD player, keep in mind your screen is visible to those behind you.
Watch your elbows.
Keep your stuff close.
Get your own reading material—don't read theirs.
Pack headphones for any portable electronics, especially games and DVD players.
Don't get drunk during (or before) the flight.
Be considerate of other passengers when you exit the plane.If you know you'll need a connecting flight, think ahead and book your flight early so you can get a seat up front and exit quickly.
Get up to use the lavatory or to walk around only when necessary.
When you get up, don't yank on the seat in front of you for support; use the seat armrests.

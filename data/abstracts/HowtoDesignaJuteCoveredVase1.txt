Decide on the type of vase you'd like.
Buy jute rope.
Hot glue one end of the jute ball of twine at the top mouth of the vase.
Wind the jute ball tightly around the vase while holding the initial end in place (just in case).
Work your way around and down the vase with the jute adding a drop or two of hot glue along the way.
Complete the jute covering at the lowest point on the vase (not underneath the vase but close).

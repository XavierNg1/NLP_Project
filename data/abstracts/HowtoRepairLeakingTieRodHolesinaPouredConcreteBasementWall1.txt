Observe the entire wall from a distance of five feet (0.13 meters) away after the location of the first tie rod hole leak.
Use a standard hammer by rapping on the area until the 5⁄8 inch (1.6 cm) (15.88 millimeters) hole is fully exposed and the edges of the hole are hammered away to a beveled edge.
Properly expose the existing 5/8 inch (15.88 millimeters) diameter tie rod hole to a depth of three inches (76.20 millimeters).
After properly exposing the tie rod hole, remove any debris in the tie rod hole by flushing out with clean water or vacuuming.

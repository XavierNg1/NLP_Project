First off decide upon what kind of game you're making.
Always make each level center around a single theme.
When it comes to music think what would fit best.
If you wish to have a boss have the boss fit with the theme of said level.
How difficult it is should depend on how early and/or later in the game it is.

,
If possible try to think up of a theme that has never been done before.
The kind of challenges should once again depend on the level's theme.

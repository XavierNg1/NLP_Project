Draw a circle.
Sketch a chord between two points.
Draw a second chord.
Make another line between A and C. This third chord (AC) should stretch through the center of the circle â€“ but you will need to draw one more line to find the exact center point.

,
Join B and D. Draw one final chord (BD) across the circle between Point B and Point D. This new line should cross over the third chord (AC) that you drew.

,
Find the center.

,
Be attentive to the speed limit sign-boards and the speed of the other cars.
Notice the flow of the traffic.
In an unknown area pay attention to sudden changes in grade where your speed will increase going down a long hill or large vegetation in a wide median where police cars can hide easily.
Look to the side of the road as far ahead as possible and pay attention to what you're doing.

Choose what songs you will be playing.
About a week before you have your first practice session, get together and pick five songs you all agree on to learn.
Agree which song you will learn first, then go home and learn your parts.
Print out copies of all the parts and take them to practice with you.
Make sure the band members are in time with each other.
Once you’re all certain you're all in time, play the song through a few times.
Repeat process for next week, but with another song you all want to cover.

,
Remember to practice the first song you learned at your next practice session too.

,
Consider writing your own music.
Before you go to your first practice, make sure you have all agreed on writing original songs.
Ask all band members to bring lyrics/poems they have written to practice, but be prepared that you may write new ones whilst there.

,
Before you go, make sure you have a basic knowledge of chords.
So now you have lyrics and musical parts.
You have it all, lyrics, vocals, music, what are you still reading this for ?,
So now your song fits, hopefully!

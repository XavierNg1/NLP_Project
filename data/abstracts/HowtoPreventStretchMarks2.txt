Stay hydrated.
Eat a healthy diet.
Increase your intake of vitamin E. Vitamin E helps to regenerate the skin and increase its elasticity, and to repair body tissues and promote blood flow.Vitamin E also encourages the production of collagen, a protein found in the skin and elsewhere that helps wounds heal, including stretch marks.You can get more vitamin E by choosing certain foods, and perhaps from certain skin creams.
Consume plenty of vitamin C. Vitamin C is the most plentiful antioxidant in the skin, and helps neutralize free radicals (damaging molecules) and promote skin health.Like vitamin E, vitamin C also helps the body make collagen.Foods high in vitamin C include: cantaloupe, citrus fruits and juices (such as orange and grapefruit), mango, pineapple, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, spinach, and cabbage.
Make sure you get enough vitamin B2 (riboflavin) and B3 (niacin).
Get the right amount of zinc.

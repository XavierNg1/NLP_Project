Do your work.
Don't get caught up in the never-ending drama.This can be hard, but the less drama, the better.
Stay positive.
Get involved in school.
Stay true to yourself!,
Seniors, juniors, and even sophomores will see the freshmen as "easy targets" for such things.
When in-doubt, just focus on school.
Have fun!,
Enjoy it!

Try to determine just how much wetness you tend to go through on any single given day.
Propose to yourself that you might not even need a disposable incontinence product at all, if you aren't leaking that much.
Look around on some incontinent companies websites, to see just what is available, especially while reading the product descriptions under most companies "Incontinence products" sections.
Determine your weight on a scale, by weighing yourself or the one who's been proposed to be wearing the incontinent garment.
Look around at the stores.
Look for incontinence pads and/or belted incontinent products, if you find the wearer doesn't wet all that much and/or all that often.
Determine just how much other coverage you'll need, in the style of diaper the wearer will be using.
Look for what types of diapers to use at night, or if you find that the wearer wets their diapers heavily.
Look on the market for disposable waterproof pads which can give the wearer some extra protection that will ensure them that no urine will soak through and end up on the bed or changing surface when they don't want it to.

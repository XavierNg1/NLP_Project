Make “Back Is Best” your sleeping priority.
Give your baby regular “tummy time.” Place your infant on his belly on a firm surface for periods of ten to fifteen minutes (if possible) at least three times per day.
Hold your newborn often, especially in an upright position.
Vary your baby's activities throughout the day.

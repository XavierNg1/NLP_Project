Start by making sure your bass is the correct height for you.

With the bass standing upright, rest the back-right edge of the bass on your left inner hip or pelvis area.

Place your left thumb on the back of the neck, a few inches from the scroll, Keep your left elbow up, parallel to the floor.

Make sure the strings are in tune.

The strings can be sounded in two main ways: Using a bow (arco) or plucked (pizzicato).

Find an F# on the lowest string by hearing a Major 2nd interval from the open string (meaning 2 half steps).

Move to the other strings in the same position, and get those notes in tune as well.On the A string,
index:B
middle:C
pinky:C#On D string,
index:E
middle:F
pinky:F#On the G string,
index:A
middle: B-flat
pinky:B,

By this time, you can work on 1/2 position (F, F#, G on the E string) and shifting between these first two positions.

Work your way up the fingerboard, learning all the finger positions and their corresponding notes.

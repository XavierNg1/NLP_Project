Understand that “natural” does not always mean safe.
Think twice about big promises or “miracle” cures.
Look past the jargon.
Avoid cure-alls.
Don’t fall for “limited time offers.” Legitimate medical treatments are not usually sold using the same methodology as cable TV plans.
Remember that natural medicines don’t have to be tested.

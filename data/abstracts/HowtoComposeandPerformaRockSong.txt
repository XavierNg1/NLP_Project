Form a band.
Find people who play instruments.
Deal with the fact that you may come up with a lopsided band.
Make sure everyone has an instrument to use.
Get a percussionist, not a drummer.
Know about the microphones.
Now it's time to try to play a song.
It's time to write a song.
After you know a few songs, try to find a place to perform.
Over time, your band will get better.

Lay the shirt on the ground with the front touching the ground, the back part where you're going to make the corset should be facing you.
Fold the sleeves back so it forms a straight line.
Cut only the back part of the shirt, cutting on the outer edge of the Sharpie line so that it's not on the good part of the shirt.
Cut off equal portions of each side of the shirt until it's a desired fit.
Momentarily move the strips and take your Sharpie making dots equal distance from each other on each side of the shirt.
Take your knife, or scissors, and carefully pierce through the shirt where the holes are.
Take the two strips still attached to the collar and stretch them out as long as you can.
Begin lacing the corset through like you would do shoes, or obviously, a corset.
Try on your shirt and tighten or loosen it as you please!

Stay downwind of the elephant at all times.
If the elephant appears to be making a mock charge, you have the option of standing absolutely still.The problem with this is that it is very hard to do when an elephant is bearing down on you.
Be noisy.
Do not show your back to the elephant.
Look for something to keep between you and the charging elephant.
If you must run, try to do it in a way that deceives the elephant.
Climb.
Hop into a ditch.

Buy some flour in local Indian stores.
Using oil, slowly mix some of the flour with it.
Roll out the dough into thin disk shapes large enough to fit on a pan.
Wash the tools you used, as flour left over can prove dangerous if the utensil is re-used again.
Sprinkle the pan slightly with oil.
Once the dough seems a pale skin color and feels solid, you are done.
Finished.

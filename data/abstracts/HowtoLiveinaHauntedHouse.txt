Take a well-built guard dog like German shepherd with you into the house.
Remind yourself that before you move anything into the house, walk through the entire place.
Remember: before moving all of your stuff into the place, move in as few items as possible at first.
Keep in mind while moving furniture or other objects in, be alert for any feelings you may have about where an item should be placed.
Try to relate to the ghost by talking about what life may have been like in the house (if it is an old house), and try to do something former residents would have done in the house while they lived there, like eating some meals in a formal dining room, or listening to period music from the time the house was built.

,
Try to talk about big events that would have happened while past owners would have been living there.
Avoid the area the ghost is in, if (s)he is in one particular place.
Try to spend a night in the place.
Accept the ghost.
Talk to the ghost.
Remember if the ghost does something scary, let it know you are upset, and that if such behavior continues it will not be tolerated.

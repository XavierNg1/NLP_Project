Have a horse that walks with you willingly wherever you go, barely so much as flinches at a flapping tarp, and focuses on you during the join-up.
At first get the horse to accept the bit.
Be patient.
Start conditioning it to be saddled.
If you want to move slowly leave it at that for the day.
Fasten it just tight enough to touch the horse's belly.
If it let you cinch it thus far with no problems, go ahead and continue tightening the girth one hole (or one inch if western) at a time.
Lunge it.
Work a few more days after you get it saddled successfully without a fight, and then you can move on.
Start working on getting it used to weight in the saddle.
If you weren't working in the round pen before, return to it.

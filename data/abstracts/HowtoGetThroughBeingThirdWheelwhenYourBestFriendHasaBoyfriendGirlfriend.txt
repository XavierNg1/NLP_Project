If your best friend gets a new boyfriend/girlfriend, just try to be positive about it, even if you don't like the relationship.
If your best friend and his/her new boyfriend/girlfriend start making you feel third wheel, know that that's not usually a good sign.
If your best friend would rather hang out with his/her new boyfriend/girlfriend, don't sweat it at first but if your best friend continues to keep doing that for a while, you should be a little concerned and start thinking that the person you call your "best friend" is really your best friend!

,
If you trust your best friend with your darkest secrets, your most embarrassing moments or with your life, think again because your best friend will probably end up telling his/her new boyfriend/girlfriend your secrets and personal things, but remember that it all depends on how good your best friend actually is, because everyone has different friends and they all act different from others.

,
Know if your best friend is not talking to you as much anymore, or if you guys are just not talking/texting anymore.
If the boyfriend/girlfriend is their first priority and they'd rather pick your best friend over you, don't waste your time getting mad over it or caring about it because, while they're off being "in love," know that you can go and have fun, enjoy being single and maybe even meet a nice girl that you like or a cute guy that you're interested in.
Hang out with other people or other crowds, or even go meet some new people!,
Be single.
If you still feel third wheel, know that you have so many other people that care about you and that want to hang out with you!,
Just have fun living life, whether you are single or not!

Consider confiding in someone you can trust.
Treat yourself to funny movies, books, and other forms of entertainment while you are resting.
Donâ€™t distract yourself from your feelings so completely that you fail to fully process, and thereby heal from, the experience.
Cry as much as you need to.
Do art.
Talk.
Ask for what you need from your partner or support person.

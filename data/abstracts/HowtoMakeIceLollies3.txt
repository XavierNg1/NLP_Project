Ask an adult to help you prepare the fruit, since you'll need to peel and slice the fruit.

Puree the hulled strawberries in a blender.If you don't have fresh strawberries, it's ok to use frozen.
Place the strainer or sieve over a bowl and pour the puree through the strainer.
Add 1 1/2 tbsp simple syrup to the strawberry puree and mix.
Pour the sweetened strawberry mixture into your ice pop molds, filling only 1/3 of the way to the top.
Put the mold in the freezer until the strawberry mixture is frozen.

Remove the pits from the peaches and slice into small pieces.

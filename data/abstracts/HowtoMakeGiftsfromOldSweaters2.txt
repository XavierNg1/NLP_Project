Choose 3 100 percent wool sweaters for this craft.
Pre-shrink your wool sweaters by washing them.
Cut the front and back of your sweaters apart and remove the arms.
Use a rotary cutter and a self-healing mat, if you have 1.
Make 11 6 by 8-inch (15.2 by 20.3 cm) blocks out of your 3 sweaters.
Cut 1 long strip that is 6 inches (15.2 cm) wide, and then cut the length every 8 inches (20.3 cm).
Lay your blocks out in an attractive pattern that your friend or family member will like.
Repeat with the next block until you have sewn all 11 blocks together.

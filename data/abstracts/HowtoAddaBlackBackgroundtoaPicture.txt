Open the image in Photoshop.
Create a new layer.
Select the "Paint Brush" tool from your Tools Palette.
Click the mask icon.
Use a soft paintbrush setting if the image has uneven edges.
Switch your opacity back to normal from time to time to see how you are doing.
Another way to make a black background in Photoshop is to cut your image using your Pen or Lasso tools or extract filter.
Finished.

Choose a method to use for creating the PCB.
Create the PCB Layout of your circuit.
Once you are happy with the schematic on your computer, match the size of the diagram on the software so that both the circuit board and the paper will have the needed sizes.

,
Print out the diagram from the software's File menu.
Align the circuit diagram on the paper with the circuit board (the diagram should be facing the copper part of the circuit board).
Once heated, carefully place the iron on top of the paper which is on top of the circuit board.

,
Place the iron there for about 30-45 seconds (depending on your iron).

,
After lifting the iron, put it aside carefully and take the circuit board to your nearest source of water.
Start the water flow and hold the circuit board below it.
Slowing start taking off the paper and soon all of the paper should come off.
Dry the board.
Etch the board using one of the methods below.
Choose your etching acid.
Prepare the acid etchant.
Submerge the board in the acid.

,
Make sure to stir every 3-5 minutes.

,
Take the board out and wash it when all unnecessary copper is etched away from the board.

,
Remove the insulating drawing material used.
To apply with this method, you will need a photosensitive (positive or negative) laminated PCB card, an UV insulator and a transparent sheet and distilled water.
With a laser printer, draw the PCB layout on the transparent sheet, in positive or negative mode, according to the photosensitive coating of the card.

,
Cover the copper side of the board with the printed transparent sheet.

,
Place the board in the UV insulator machine/chamber.

,
Turn on the UV machine.
Once done, remove the board from the UV insulator.
The further steps to follow are described in the acid etching method specific steps 3 to 7.

,
Drill mount points.
Mount and solder the electronic components on board.

Assign script writers to scenes.
Start with a blank video that is uploaded to one of the popcorn supported platforms.

,
Decide whether you will work on script writing sequentially or in parallel.
Send the blank video's link to script writers, along with their designated scenes' start and end times.

,
Follow up on the script writers depending on the model of work you decided earlier.

,
Merge the different scripts into one remix (if you decided to work in parallel) or take the final remix (if you chose to work sequentially), and post to the project team.

,
Make a document-format of the script if possible.

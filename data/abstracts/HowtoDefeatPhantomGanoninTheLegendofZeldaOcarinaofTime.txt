Go into the middle of the arena to start the battle.
In the first part of the battle, Phantom Ganon will go into one of the six paintings in the arena, and two replicas of him will come out of two paintings.
After doing this three times, he'll get off his horse and attack you with an energy ball.
Once he's stunned, slash him with your sword until he gets back up.
Repeat the process of hitting the energy ball back at him and slashing him after he's stunned, until you've defeated him.

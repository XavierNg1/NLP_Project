Think about your guitar as an extension of your voice, mimicking singers.
Think about silences as powerful musical tools.
Use repeated themes and notes to give your solo structure.
Use bends, slides, and vibrato for more expressive and personalized playing.
Think of the entire solo, not just the notes you are currently playing.

Get the attitude.
Stop swearing.
Wear the clothes.
Note that a conservative or preppy look is best for this time of your life, when you are at your most vulnerable.
Wear stuff that is clean, doesn't reveal too much, fits and suits you, and isn't too harsh.
Shower every day.
Make sure your hair is nice.
Don't comb or brush your hair too much, and don't use too many hair products.
Keep in mind that medium length is quite nice, and a bob is cute and neat.
Maintain your nails.

Always be nice and generous.

As for sports, just make sure you drink plenty of water to keep off red faces and sweat, and try your hardest.

Compliment everyone, but not too much.
At home, try your best to please your parents.
Make sure your belongings are neat.

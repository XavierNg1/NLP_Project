Practice writing skills: Writing skills such as simple grammar, spelling, sentence structure and nominalization are all important for those who wish to be decent story writers.
Create an outline: Before you begin your novel, it is a good idea to have a general idea of the plot.
Create your characters: Sometimes it can be difficult to think up characters that are believable, and your characters can seem very abstract.
Create a location: A novel isn't complete without a scene.
Open your mind: Writers block is very common, so if you are experiencing it try to open your mind with other 'artsy' activities, such as painting, reading or drawing.
Search for inspiration: Still stuck?,
Imagine yourself in the novel.
Read plenty: If you really want to be a decent novel writer, it would be wise to read decent books.
Take heed of children: Children have the most amazing imaginations, so if you are ever stuck for ideas listen to what the youngsters have to say.
Practice sentence structure: If you just can't seem to get your sentences to flow try reading other stories and observe how the author has structured their sentences.
Avoid going over the top: Once you have a good idea you may find yourself getting carried away, when this occurs be sure to read over your writing a few times, you may find some of your ideas have already been used or your idea is just plain boring.

Start your about me with your name, using variations of Hey It's ___!, unless you have a graphic or large text of some sort before your about me.
Say something like; My name is __ and I'm __ years old, etc, etc, is kind of boring.
Next, you can add some info about yourself.
Have fun with it but don't make it too long or you will look like a Myspace whore!

Set Developer to Checked or On so you can work with macros.
The following macro code should be copied from "#** Sub Macro04, etc.",
Part of the code at the end has been disabled with apostrophes at the beginnings of the lines.
You should now have the Articles, Views and Article#'s on the 'Daily Sort' worksheet.Enter in cell A1, Article,Set column width for B:C to .08 inches,Enter in D1, Views,Set column width for E to .38 inches,Enter in cell F1, Art#,Enter in cell G1, Rank,Enter in cell H1, Seen,Enter in cell I1, Two,
When you're ready to run these macros daily on your own data, Macro t will take the information in 'Articles and Views'!WHOLE, i.e.
Keep it simple and just enter the year's dates across the top.
Suppose, for example, that you start the process on 04/01.
Supposing, for example, that your update to column CV started 04/01.
Edit Copy cell range CV154:CV156 and Edit Paste Special Formulas to cell range CW154:NJ156.
Note that the middle formula in cell CV155, =SUM($CV$150:CV150), creates the month to date sum of article views by summing from the $Absolute$ starting point of $CV$150 and then relatively for each new cell to the right, so that the formula in cell CW155 is =SUM($CV$150:CW150).
This author has in cell NL1, 01/17, and in cell NL2, to date.
Then, summarized, this author has in cell NM1, 1/18-1/31, and in NM2, Period.
Then, in cell NN1, this author has, To Date 1/31/15, and in cell NN2, 1/31/15 formatted yyyy.
Next, in cell NO1, is the value, 2/28/2015, formatted mmm, and in cell NO2, is the same date, formatted yyyy.Continue this process for each month, summarizing all the month's days across horizontally into one monthly amount, per article, and then down to a monthly total.
Enter to cell NL150 the formula, =SUM(NL6:NL149).Enter the months across the top, and the year, for cells NO1 to NY2,Enter to cell NZ1 the label, To Date, and to NZ2 the formula, =now(), formatted yyyy.Enter to cell NZ6 the formula, =SUM(NN6:NY6), and Format Cells Number Custom 0;0;0,
Enter to cell NZ151 the formula, =NZ150-D150.
Over to the right, this author analyzed the zeroes of February, 2015 by formulating an IF statement such that if there were an amount <> 0 in each February article-day, return a 0, else return a 1.
Here is a picture of the SEEN and TWO Categories this author uses; "SEEN" means that it's the category seen by the user in the upper right hand corner of the Article page and "TWO" means that it's the second category, which is listed at the bottom left corner of the article page.
And here are the First 70 Categories for the current 142 articles (by clicking directly on the image, or double-clicking, you can get a zoomed-in view):

,
Here are the 2nd 72 Categories for the current 142 articles:

,Input the Ranks, then the 142 * 2 categories, SEEN and TWO, to cell range G6:I147 per the images above.
The concatenation with the hyphen between is done for the CAT ANALYSIS worksheet.
If you don't care to input all the categories, dummy in 1 or a few and paste them in below as you see fit.
You have already run Macro p to populate this worksheet (ws) with Articles, Views and Article#s.Enter in cell A9 the formula, ="*]", and Edit Copy it and Edit Paste it to cell range A10:A151, then Copy A10:A151 and do Edit Paste Special Values for cell range A10:A151 to conserve memory.
Enter to cell A1 the following text: The objective is usually to update the latest article written with Related wikiHows of formerly written articles listed here on the "Relateds" tab.
Enter to cell B1 the following text: HOW IT WORKS: 1) Build this spreadsheet with the variable names Searcher for Row 1 and TopRow for Row 166; 2) Go to worksheet tab Article Views and Other and decide on a list of bracketed Relateds to post for an Article on this worksheet tab; 3) Copy them; 4) Click on the next article's filename in the ordered sequence being addressed to open that wikiHow page; 5) Click on Edit and go to Relateds after checking the top of the article to see what Relateds already have links; 6) Edit in the Related wikiHows field and paste the list you brought in -- be careful of duplicates and the article you are working in; 7) Copy the final list of relateds and then PUBLISH THE EDIT; 8) Go to this Relateds worksheet and paste the list of Relateds into cell A166.
Insert a new comment for cell B1 and input the above text into the comment.
Set row height for Row 1 to 5.31", hide rows 2:3 and 5.
Realize that this is a work in progress and this author has yet to decide on an ideal model for analyzing Relateds.Enter to cell EX8 the label, Under 10,Enter to cell EY8 the label, Over 10,Enter to cell EZ8 the label, At 10,Enter to cell EX9 the label, AVAILABLE and Format Cells fill yellow and Border red outline boldest, font red bold,Enter to cell EX10 the formula, =IF(10-EW10>0,10-EW10,"") and Format Cells Fill tan,Enter to cell EY10 the formula, =IF(EW10>10,EW10-10,""),Enter to cell EZ10 the formula, =IF(EW10=10,1,""),Edit Copy cell range EX10:EZ10 and Edit Paste to cell range EX11:EZ151,
You might try inputting some article rows with 1's less than 10 in total across, then others equal to 10 across, and still other greater than 10 across, just to see that these formulas work, and the next group of formulas as well.Copy cell range EX8:EZ8 and Paste it to FB8:FD8.Enter to cell FB10 the formula, =IF(EW10<10,EW10,""),Enter to cell FC10 the formula, =IF(EW10>10,EW10,""),Enter to cell FD10 the formula, =IF(EW10=10,10,""),Copy cell range FB10:FD10 and Paste it to FB11:FD151,Enter to cell EX153 the formula, =SUM(EX10:EX152) and Paste it to cells EY153:EZ153.

Edit Copy cell range A166: E166 and Edit Paste it to cell range A167:E683 (or down quite far because it's always getting deleted from),
You will follow the instructions in cells A1 and B1, HOW IT WORKS, which basically are designed to keep track of the Related wikiHows actually posted or edited into a brand new article (or an old one):

Copy ready-made ready-to-be-Relateds from sheet 'Article Views and Other' column J, or worksheet 'Relateds' cell range A10:A151 and paste them to cell A167 down.
VERTICAL UPDATING: You will probably also want to take the new article's prepared ready-to-be-a-Related column A version and spread it downwards IN IT'S COLUMN at the far left of row 1 in column J, and update / populate old wikiHows with the new article as their new Related.WARNING -- From time to time, the macro might not fill A166:E166 with x's and formulas so you have to copy them and paste them from below.

As before, copy these macros from here into MS Word or a Text Editor application that has a Replace All function and do REPLACE ALL of "#** " with nothing (disregarding the quote marks).
The way the macros work is as follows:

Sub Macro01_TransferTodayToYesterday_j is DAILY run by pressing command+option(alt)+j first BEFORE getting the wikiHow data.
Here are the macros, including strikethrough Macro e that still needs work.

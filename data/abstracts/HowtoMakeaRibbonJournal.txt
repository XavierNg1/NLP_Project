Take a good amount of paper (20-30 pages, or more, depends how thick you want your journal to be) and cut them in half.
Find something to use as a cover.
Decorate your cover.
Cut a strip of ribbon that is long enough to hold all the paper together.
Thread the strips of ribbon though the holes punched in the paper.
Tie it off with a flourish, and now you have your own personal journal.

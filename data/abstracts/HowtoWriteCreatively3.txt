Understand that your first draft is just that -- a draft.
Read your entire work and ask what the most important threads are.
Cut as much away from the first draft as you can, ruthlessly erasing.
Show your work to others and ask for feedback.
Edit thoroughly multiple times checking that grammar and spelling are perfect.

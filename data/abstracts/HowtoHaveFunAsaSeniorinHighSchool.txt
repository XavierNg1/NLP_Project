Try to stay on top of your homework - even though you are a senior, you are still in school.
Take all your required courses in lower grades - if you have a leftover math credit or art credit, you might not be able to take the fun classes you want as a senior.
Go to the games, the concerts, the plays - it's your senior year and it will make good memories many years after graduation.
Break up the cliques - it is time to break the walls.
Make your mark - if you have some major high school goal, it is the time to do it.
Think about your future - during breaks, such as Christmas and Thanksgiving, take college tours, take career assessments, decide what you want to do when you get out the door.
Attend the prom or formal - if you have a special girlfriend/boyfriend or a crush, ask that person to the prom/formal.
Have fun at Skip Day - if your school has a skip day, attend it.
Don't look back - High school has many great memories but focus also on the future and the better times to come.

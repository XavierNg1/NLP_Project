Decide how much your business can afford to spend on employee holiday gifts, and then do the math to determine how much that translates to per employee.
Personalize gifts by buying unique items for each person.
Choose one gift that you think all employees would enjoy, such as a fruit and cheese basket, and buy one for each person.
Gift cards to local businesses can make good employee gifts at the holidays, as long as you choose the right business.
Consider giving your employees the gift of paid time if you can't hand out large holiday bonuses.
Pick up the tab for lunch, a late afternoon pizza, or morning donuts and coffee more often during the holiday season.

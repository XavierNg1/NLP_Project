Identify your caterpillar.
Inform yourself about your caterpillar's host plant.
Eventually when your caterpillar grows, it will start to wander around.
Be sure to have another hanging stick out for your butterfly, when it emerges.
Let the butterfly go after couple hours, cause it needs it's wings to dry off and harden.

This is where some things change.
Keep the pet for 5 days so the bone/limb can fully heal.You don't need any medicine but you do need bandages and a neck cone which you can purchase both from vets b us for 115 and 100 simoleons respectively.
To treat a broken bone/limb take the pet to the grooming table and dress it in the bandages and neck cone.

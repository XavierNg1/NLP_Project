Cut a 5 by 22-inch (12.7 by 55.88-centimeter) strip out of fabric.Choose a color and pattern that matches your curtains.
Fold the fabric strip in half lengthwise with the right sides facing inward.
Sew along two of the edges, using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.
Turn the curtain tieback inside out.
Tuck the raw edge in, then press the entire tieback flat with an iron.If the raw edge won't stay tucked inside the tieback, secure it with pins.

Topstitch all the way around the tieback, ¼-inch (0.64centimeter) away from the edge.Use a color that matches your fabric; you can also use a contrasting color if you'd like something more interesting.
Hand sew a small, plastic or metal ring to the top left and top right corners of your tieback.Make sure that the rings are big enough to fit over the wall hooks.

Push your bed into a corner.
Check to see if your bed as a black-hole between the headboard and the mattress where your pillows go.
Tuck your fitted sheets under the corners.
Move your bed if it is over any vents.The heat or cold can get trapped under the bed and make it uncomfortable for not just the toddler, but you, too.
Keep breakables out of reach.
Consider replacing the hand-grip handles with knobs so that toddlers can't climb up on the dresser.
Keep things around the dresser to distract the child from the contents of the dresser.
Take care if you have a big closet on the wall without a door but with shelves sitting up on it and a big shower-curtain like pole that holds all the hangers.
Keep your clothing out of reach.
Check for all electrical outlets.

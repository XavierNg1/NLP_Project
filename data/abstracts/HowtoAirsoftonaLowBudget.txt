If you have a low budget use cost efficient sites like weaponblender.com, airsplat.com, or airsoftstation.com;
,
For budgets 50-90 dollars, I recommend gas pistols.
For budgets around 90-100 dollars, you want a metal gearbox AEG (automatic electric gun).
If you have a 100-125 dollar budget, you can start getting nicer, more durable, and harder shooting AEGs.
If you have a 125-150 dollar budget, now you can have some fun.
When using an AEG or a gas pistol, ALWAYS use the .20 gram bb's as opposed to the standard .12 gram.
Remember to take the cost of bb's and shipping into account.

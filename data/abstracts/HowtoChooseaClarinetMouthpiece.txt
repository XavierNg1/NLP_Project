Decide how much you are willing to pay for your mouthpiece.
Decide what type of music you want to play on your new mouthpiece.
Consult your private teacher (if you have one).
If you have a good idea of which mouthpiece you want, you can just order it on Amazon or Woodwind & Brasswind.
If you don't know what you want, pay a visit to your local music store.
Try each potential mouthpiece on your clarinet.
Make sure you stick to reputable brands like Vandoren, Selmer, and Yamaha.

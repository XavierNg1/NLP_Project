Choose your fleece.
Stack the two pieces of fleece together with the right sides facing out.
Trace your pillow or your shape onto the fleece.
Draw a second shape around the first one, leaving a 2 to 4-inch (5.08 to 10.16-centimeter) border between them.This border will make your tassels.
Cut around the larger shape.
Cut 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide slits all around your shape.Make the slits go all the way down to the first shape that you drew.
Fill your pillow with fiberfill, then finish tying the strips together.

During the game usually you get three hits to get the ball over the net, and the last one is usually the hit/attack.
If the opposite team is serving the ball to you, and the serve isn't going directly to the back row players, you call "SHORT" so the back row know to move up and adjust there position.
Whenever you are on serve receive, make sure when the server tosses the ball up to serve you say, "Ball's Up!",
Tell the coach if you're getting tired.
If and when you get pulled out, you're still on the team.

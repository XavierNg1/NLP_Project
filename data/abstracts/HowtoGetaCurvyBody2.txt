Learn the Pilates ab series.
Start with the Pilates “one hundred.” Lay on your back with your legs bent at a 90-degree angle, a pose called “table top.” Pump your arms between your knees and hips for 90 seconds.
Move to the “single leg stretch.” Remain in tabletop position.
Continue with the “double leg stretch.” Start in table top while hugging your legs.
Do “straight leg stretch.” Straighten both your legs and place them in a 45-degree angle from your body.
Follow with the “lower leg lift.” Place your hands behind your head with your elbows wide.
Finish with the “criss cross.” Return to the same position you used when you did the single leg stretch.

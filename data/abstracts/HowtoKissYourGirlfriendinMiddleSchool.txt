Get some privacy.
Freshen your breath.
Make her feel special.
Make sure she’s ready for a kiss.
Make physical contact.
Avoid the common kissing pitfalls.
Lean toward her until your faces are almost touching.
Tilt your head slightly.
Kiss her.
Caress her cheeks and hair.
Use your hands (a little bit).
Don’t forget to breathe.
Slowly pull away.
End on a good note.

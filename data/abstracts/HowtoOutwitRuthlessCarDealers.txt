Realize that there’s more to purchasing a car than price.
Don’t let these automobile geniuses intimidate you.
Proceed into the service lot and look at the license plate frames.
Choose your salespeople; don’t let them choose you.
Educate yourself.
Don’t let salespeople woo you into trusting them with their “impressive" knowledge of cars.
Know the competition.
Be firm.
Once you show serious intention of buying, the salesperson will offer you a test drive, during which he or she will talk glowingly about the car to get you to take mental ownership of it.
Avoid answering personal questions.
Read the sticker carefully.
Take particular note of a common padding tactic: A prep fee of $100 or more.
Don’t let yourself get “turned over.",
When the deed is done, inspect your new car thoroughly before you leave the dealership.

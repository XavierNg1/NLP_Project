First, you will come down a hill in a truck being chased by the Russians in their trucks.
Next, when you have taken all the enemies out in the first truck, reload and get ready to defeat the next group of enemies.
By now you will have ran into the last part of the mission where you tip over your truck and you have to escape the falling bridge.
The last thing to do is kill Zakhaev and beat the game.

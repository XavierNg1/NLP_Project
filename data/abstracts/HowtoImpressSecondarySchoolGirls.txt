Be yourself.
Talk to the girl.
Go public with your relationship after a little while.
Never try to make her jealous by hitting on her friends.
Forget the mantra "Treat 'em mean to keep 'em keen".
Respect her boundaries.
Act like a gentleman, if you can't actually Be a Gentleman!,
Try not to get jealous if your girlfriend is talking to another boy.
Have fun with your girlfriend!

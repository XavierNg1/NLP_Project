Think about your apology and really get to the bottom of the problem.
Start off with a simple, blunt "I'm sorry.",
If she asks you to leave, tell her you want to apologize.
Calmly explain to her the reasons behind your actions.
Give her time to respond.
Tell her you'll give her time if she needs it.

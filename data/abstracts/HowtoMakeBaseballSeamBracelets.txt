Take your knife and cut the white away from the ball in two separate sections.
Peel away the two tongue shaped leather pieces.
Once youâ€™ve peeled away the two leather portions, peel the seam off of the ball in one piece.

,
Turn the seam inside-out, looking for the beginning and ending strings for the baseball seam.
Once you have located the ends, turn the whole seam right-side-out.
Once you have the sticky, stringy mess removed and your seam is neatly trimmed up, go ahead and work the end threads out, exposing eight needle holes (four on each side).

,
Cut the seam, across the leather, leaving equal space on both sides.
Fold the seam in half.
Gently ease out the thread from the newly cut ends.
Once you have tied the ends, trim the threads, but do not trim the leather.

,
Cut a piece of suede cord to ten inches.
Trim your leather.
And there you have it!

Start by opening a new Excel workbook and create two worksheets, DATA and SAVES.
Set Preferences.
Begin by learning the basics of neutral operations: for a+b = a*b = c, with a and b constant values, addition is a neutral operation versus multiplication.
Click in the upper left corner of the DATA worksheet between the 1 of Row 1 and the A of column A in order to select the entire worksheet.
Enter the column headings.
Enter row 2 data and formulas.
Perform Goal Seeking on row 2 as follows.
Enter row 3 data and formulas as follows, w/o quotes:  A3: a,b; B3: "=B2"; C3: "=B3/(B3-1)"; D3: "=B3+C3"; E3: "=B3*C3"; F3: "=E3-D3".
Enter row 4 formulas as follows w/o quotes:  B4: "=D2".
Enter row 5 formulas as follows.
Now the work gets much simpler.
Go to cell A7 and type d and skip down two cells and type e and skip down two cells to cell A11 and type f and continue in this manner until you reach cell 51 and type z into it.

,
Edit Go To cell range A3:A51 and copy it.
Select cell B55 and enter w.o quotes "=B3"; select cell B56 and enter "=C3", in cell B57 enter "=C5"; in cell B58 enter "=C7" and continue in this manner, skipping a referred-to row until you reach cell B80 and enter "=C51".

,Select cell B81 and enter the formula w/o quotes "=SUM(B55:B80)" and the answer should be 31.984453366650600

,
Select cell range C55:C80 and with cell C55 the active highlighted cell enter the formula w/o quotes "=B55" and Edit Fill Down.

,
Select cell C81 and enter the formula w/o quotes "=C55*C56*C57*C58*C59*C60*C61*C62*C63*C64*C65*C66*C67*C68*C69*C70*C71* C72*C73*C74*C75*C76*C77*C78*C79*C80" and the answer should be 31.984453366650600 thus proving that the sum of a to z = the product of a to z.
Copy and save the worksheet to the SAVES worksheet.

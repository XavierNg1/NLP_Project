Understand the different kinds of boils.
If you're unsure of the medical reason behind your boil or lesion, consult a doctor.
Use heat to treat the boil.
Do not drain, lance, or pop the boil if it is still small and firm.
Only pop the boil if it becomes soft and develops a visible pustule (optional).Again, most boils can be drained without popping, as popping is disruptive to the skin and inflammatory.
For larger boils, consult a doctor.

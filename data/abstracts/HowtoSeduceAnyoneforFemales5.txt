Your make-up should be slightly dramatic, but not gothic.
Use thickening mascara, Maybelline 700x's mascara has worked the best.
Think of shadows.
Keep lips looking natural and pouty sexily.
Use a foundation that matches the skin colour on your neck, because then you can blend it out and you won't have a weird coloured neck to make your make-up too obvious, and make sure you blend at the jaw and hairlines.

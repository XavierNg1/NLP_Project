First, you must love Doritos®.
Plan the ad beforehand, possibly adding a script if anyone says anything.
Think of something clever for the ad.
Don't do the ad all by yourself!,
Once you've practiced, and practiced, and practiced some more, do the actual ad.
Edit the footage after you've filmed the whole thing!,
When they run a request for a new Doritos® ad on TV, or if it mentions it on a packet of Doritos®, it will have the address to send the footage to.
You may also get paid.

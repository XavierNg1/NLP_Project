Do not open too many apps at the same time.
Don't download the jail breaker app unless you are sure you want it.
Extend the battery life:


Don't leave the device in the charger much longer after it reaches 100% charge.
If the programs do crash, hold the sleep/wake button and the home button (round with square in the middle) together until a white Apple logo shows up on the screen and once the device is turned on, close all programs.

Start by watering the plant well the day before.
Prune your wild rose back to just a few inches above the ground.
Carefully remove the entire root ball from the soil.
Burn or dispose of the rose bush, rather than composting it.
Watch out for re-growth.
Consider more extreme removal methods if the rose bush continues to reappear.

Measure the circumference, or distance around the outside of a bicycle wheel in order to properly calibrate a bicycle speedometer, odometer, GPS or computer.
Calculate circumference easily by multiplying the tire's diameter by pi.The circumference of any circle can be determined quickly if you already know the diameter of the tire from the outer edge of one side to the other.
Measure the circumference with a string.
Add a dot of wet paint to a spot on the bicycle tire's tread.

Familiarize yourself with drawing people.
Once you have the basics of drawing humans down, decide which character(s) you want to draw.
Start with the basic proportionate shapes and edit them until the correct body is found.
After you've gotten the wanted and correct look that you're okay with, darken your sketch lines.
Once you have your first character, compare your first drawing to the chosen image.
After you have a good drawing of that character, try out all of your favorite characters.

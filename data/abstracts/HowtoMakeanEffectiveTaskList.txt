Decide on 7 (arbitrary number) things you wish to do each and every day.
Create a chart (An index card works perfectly) nine by nine.
Set a personal goal for the number of times in a week that you plan to accomplish each of the 7 items and put that number next to the name in the first column.
At the end of each week total the Rows across to see how you did.
Carry the card/list with you ALL the TIME.

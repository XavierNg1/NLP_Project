Get three {3} 2-liter bottles.
Cut the tops and bottoms off; the leftover should look like this.
Sand the plastic.
Once the pieces are fully sanded you can start painting it.
Carefully cut out the stands from the bottom of the bottle.
Take one of the middle pieces.
With the second middle piece, cut it into two halves.
Take the smaller of the pieces you cut in step 7 and cut a small slip off from it, leaving the larger one just enough to be able to cover the bottom of arm piece.

,
Take the stand you cut before.
Glue each of the 9 stands to the base of the gauntlet inside the areas as shown in the picture{three to each section.},
using the top piece from the bottle, cut out a hand guard like the picture, The back of of it should bend around toÂ  give you added support.

,
A little tip is to put on your old glove and then put a cardboard cut out on top of your hand to protect if from the hot glue.
Put the glove on and put some form of protection between your skin and the fabric and slowly hot glue the finger joints to the glove.
Enjoy your new gauntlet.

Try camouflage.

Try to find an experienced guide, or just a native, to help you find your way.

Make sure you know what poisonous plants and animals look like.
Know where which animals will be there.
Take well-traveled paths, if there's any at all.

If you are in a car, then do not panic, as those animals don't really care about the car (unless it is blaring loud music or trying to run over animals).
If you smell urine, go away; it means you're in another animal's territory.

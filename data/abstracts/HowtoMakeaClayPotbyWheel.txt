Grab some old clothes.
Get your clay (about a half pound is a good start for beginners) and start squishing it.
Smack it into a round ball.
Get the surface of your wheel dry.

,
Place your clay as close to the middle as you can.

,
Pat the clay down into a cone shape.

,
Start spinning the wheel and wet your clay, then begin to center your clay.
Wet your hands, and raise the clay into a cone, then squish it down into a thick hockey puck.
Stick your thumb slowly into the middle (spinning of course) until it leaves about 1/2 of an inch for the bottom.
Stick your four fingers into the hole, and slowly pull out until the hole is about as big as you want the bottom to be.
Place your fingers on the edge of your newly widened hole.
If you want to shape it, just "cup" the part of it that you want to be smaller then the other.
If you want the top to be a bit wider than the neck, slowly pull it out a bit.
When you're finished, get a wire or fishing line, and use it to cut the bottom off the wheel.
Dry it by air for about two nights then you are ready to foot.

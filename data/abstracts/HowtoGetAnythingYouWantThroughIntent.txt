Clear your mind.
Focus on the object in your mind and “ask” the universe for it.
Spend some time thinking about how what you want makes you feel.
Feel the joy of having the object as if you already had it.
Take some time to think on what you desire.
Don't dwell on any negative emotions.
Believe that the universe will give you new opportunities and that your visualization will manifest positively in your life.
Trust your intuition.
Express gratitude for what you already have.

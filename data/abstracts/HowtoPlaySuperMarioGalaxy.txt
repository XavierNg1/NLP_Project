After inserting the Super Mario Galaxy disc into the Wii console, turn on your Nintendo Wii, and select the small upper-left hand box.After selecting your icon, select Play this file.
Now, you can start playing!,
Mario has some cool new moves too.
Another move you can do is a long jump.
Notice how Mario crouches when you press Z.
Finally, Mario's last unique move is a sideways flip.In the level you are currently on (which acts like a tutorial), all you are required to do is go straight towards Princess Peach's castle, knowing that she has something she wants to give you (if you read her letter at the start of the game), until a cutscene of Bowser, the main enemy, appears.
Run up the path, avoiding the fiery meteors, until you reach Peach's castle.Then, Mario will awaken on an unfamiliar planetoid and see a star creature, which will turn into a star bunny, and tells him that he wants to play.
Follow the instructions that appear throughout the rest of the tutorial.

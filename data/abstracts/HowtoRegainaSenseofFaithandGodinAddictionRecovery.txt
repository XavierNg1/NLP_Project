Pray - Reconnect with life and that quiet but persistent voice inside you that is telling you to be more.
Forgive Yourself - You may have asked for God’s help in the past and then turned it away because you did not feel worthy of it.
Don't blame - Someone caught up in an addiction may not want to realize or own their choices and behavior.
Practice trust - If you ask God for help, God does not forget about it, we do.
Listen to your emotions - Emotions are the nerves to the soul.
Don’t just focus on past problems - What you focus on, you will achieve and become.
Focus on God, don't fight against Satan - Similar to the above step, be careful not to base your life only on the fear of some insidious disease.
Don't confuse God's judgement with your own - Once you ask God to forgive you for the pain and hurt you caused by drinking and drugging, God does.
Hold yourself accountable.- Don’t confuse your actions or the actions of others with faith or God’s desire or will to love or help you.

Know the dangers of doorways.
Approach a closed door on the side the handle is on.
Touch the handle of the door, and "soft-check" the handle to see if the door is locked or not.
Bring your gun to close-contact firing position as you reach for the door handle.
Turn the handle quickly and swing the door open.
Step back from the doorway immediately.
Scan the room the same way you would go around a corner.
Move into the room once you have viewed as much of the room as possible.
Look over your shoulder as you enter to view the corner you are not heading toward.
Clear the rest of the room for any immediate danger.

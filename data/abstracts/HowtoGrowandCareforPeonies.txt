Plant peonies in the late summer to early fall, at least six weeks before the ground typically freezes in your area.
Dig a hole about 15 inches (38.1Â cm) deep and wide enough to comfortably accommodate the roots.
Wait for them to bloom.
To make your peony produce even larger blossoms, leave only one of the large round buds on each stem, pinching off the smaller buds early in their development.

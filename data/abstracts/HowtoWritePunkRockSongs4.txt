Prioritize energy, speed, and power when playing punk drums -- as long as you can keep time, too.
Lean on your kick, snare, and hi-hat for a basic beat that fits any punk song.
Try out a double-kick pedal for your bass drum.
Use big, speedy drum fills on the toms and crash cymbals to transition through the song.
Build tension and release through a careful use of silence.
Mix up the verse and chorus.

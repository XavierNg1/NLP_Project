Find a piece of thin cardboard.
Cut two circles, about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) in diameter, out of the cardboard.
Out of the center of each circle, cut a smaller circle.
If you want your templates to last, you can cover them with masking tape, but you don't have to.

Line up the rings on top of each other.
When you are finished wrapping, set aside a 1-foot length of yarn that is the same color as your pom pom.
Carefully pull templates off your pom pom.
Finished.

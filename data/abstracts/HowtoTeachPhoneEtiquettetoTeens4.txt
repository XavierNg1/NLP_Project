Get into your teen’s shoes.Try to see the situation from their eyes before you begin teaching them phone etiquette.
Be able to justify each piece of etiquette.Your teen might not immediately understand why phone etiquette is important or how it can impact the perception others have of them.
Be a positive role model.The best way to teach phone etiquette to your teen is to practice good phone etiquette yourself.
Have a penalty system in place.If your teen is not conforming to phone etiquette – especially in ways that are dangerous or disruptive – remove their phone privileges for a set period of time.

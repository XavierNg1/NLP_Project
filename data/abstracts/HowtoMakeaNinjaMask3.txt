Pick out a large t-shirt (preferably in black or dark blue) and turn it inside out.
Get a friend to trace your head silhouette.
Cut the paper silhouette out and place it on the t-shirt.
Cut the t-shirt around the silhouette.
Sew the sides together once you have cut the mask out of the t-shirt.
Hold the newly sewed mask up to your face and mark where your eye hole should go.
Turn the mask inside out if you do not want your stitching to show.

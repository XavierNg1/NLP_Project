Place an 18 centimeter (7.1Â in) loose-bottomed cake tin on a sheet of grease proof paper and draw around it.
Break the chocolate into a saucepan, then add the butter and condensed milk.
Put the biscuits in a clear plastic food bag and crush them into crumbs using a rolling pin.
When the mixture is all combined, spoon it in the cake tin.
Finished.

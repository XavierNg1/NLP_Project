Before you take your pictures, you're going to have to decide whether you want them professionally done.
If you decide to go professional, find a reputable company that specializes in artistic modeling photographs.
Once you have chosen, schedule a date and time for the shoot.
Leading up to the shoot, make sure you eat healthy and continue with hair and acne care as you always would.
If you are taking non-professional pictures, you're going to need a good backdrop.
Apply a little or no makeup- just a small amount of eyeliner, mascara and smudge of blush.
When you stand in front of your backdrop, smile!,
Have the photographer take plenty of pictures, with varying positions.
After you've finished shooting, import your photos to a computer and select which ones you'd like to use- you can generally have a couple, but it's better to have a few REALLY good ones than many mediocre ones.
Print your photos.
Congrats!

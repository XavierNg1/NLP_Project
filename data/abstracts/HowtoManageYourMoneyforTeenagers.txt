Get some money.
Save as much of the money you make as you can.

,
Once you have enough, ask your parents to open up a savings account for you.
If you are not old enough to get a job, work various jobs around the house, picking things up when you are not asked, or working extra hard on something that could earn some money.
Start saving young.
Keep an organized analysis pad (which can be bought at any office store), a calculator, a paper clip, and three pens - one red, one blue, and one black.
Another excellent idea is to buy or make a tin that can't be opened.
After, cut a slit in the top wide a long enough to fit coins.
Once you've filled the tin, open it with a can/tin opener!

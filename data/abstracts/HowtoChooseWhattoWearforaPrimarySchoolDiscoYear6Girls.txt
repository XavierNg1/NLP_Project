Decide on what sort of style you want.
Preppy girls: go for a pair of skintight jeans ( dark denim!),
If you're girly, wear a knee length floaty floral dress with pretty black pumps.
If you are a sporty type, wear something like a set of black Lycra shorts and a cool top.
Assemble your makeup items.
Apply a couple of dabs of blusher onto your CHEEKBONES.
Add a little bit of lipstick.

Put on your outfit and...

Done.

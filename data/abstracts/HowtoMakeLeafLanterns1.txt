Prepare your leaves.
Cut four 8 by 16-inch (20.32 by 40.64-centimeter) rectangles out of wax paper.
Fold the rectangles in half widthwise to make 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) squares.Make sure that you are folding the sheets with the wax sides together, otherwise, they won't stick when you iron them.Run your fingernail along the folded edges when you are done to sharpen the crease.

,
Place the leaves face-down inside the folded paper.
Cover the sheets with an ironing cloth, then iron them until the wax melts and sticks.Place your first panel on the ironing board, and cover it with an ironing cloth.
Wait for the paper to cool, then tape the panels together to form a long strip.
Consider giving your lantern a border.
Fold the strip to make a cube, then tape the first and last panels together.
Use the lantern.

Put the dried porcini in a bowl, add 2 cups water, and soak for at least 15 minutes.
Peel and finely-chop the onion.
Put the butter in a 5-to 6-quart soup pot over medium high heat.
While the vegetables are sauteing, remove the casing from the sausage and cut into small chunks.
When the vegetables are ready, add the sausage.
Lift the porcini out of the water, squeezing the excess liquid back into the bowl.
Finished.

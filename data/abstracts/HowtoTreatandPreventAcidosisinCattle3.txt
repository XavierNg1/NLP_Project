The most obvious preventative measure is to not have cattle on grain in the first place.
Feeding grain often cannot be avoided, though, so gradually increasing the grain ration over time is the best way to prevent acidosis while still feeding cattle grain.

Always include roughage with the grain diet you are giving your cattle.
Often Nature-caused interruptions like storms, hot- or cold-spells, and extreme weather, or change in schedules such as being handled or hauled to a new farm or ranch can cause cattle to reduce their feed intake or stop eating all together until the danger has passed.

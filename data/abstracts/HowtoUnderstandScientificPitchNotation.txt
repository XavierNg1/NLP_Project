Realize that scientific pitch notation isn't rocket science.
Scientific pitch notation combines the name of a note, the accidental (see next step), and the octave in which the given note lies.
Accidentals are simply the little symbols you sometimes see by a note (either in scientific notation or on a staff) that give whether the note is sharp, flat, or natural.
When all of the above are combined together, you will be able to look at a scientific pitch notation and know automatically what the note is, what octave it's in, and whether or not it's sharp or flat.

Câ™¯4 indicates C sharp (one semitone above natural) in the fourth octave.

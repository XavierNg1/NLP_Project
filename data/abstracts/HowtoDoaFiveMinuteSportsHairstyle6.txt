Use this hairstyle if you have very short hair.
Brush out your hair and choose a side to part your hair on.
Working from your new part, use a mousse or styling wax to push your hair away from your part to the opposite side of your head.
Use your fingers to distribute the remaining wax from your hands to the rest of your hair.

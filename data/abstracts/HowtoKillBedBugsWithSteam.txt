Use caution when steaming an area that has recently been treated with chemicals (including diatomaceous earth powder).
Before steaming, vacuum the areas to be treated.
Carefully read the instructions provided with your steamer to prepare the steamer for operation.
Purge the steamer into a cloth towel to clear the nozzle of excess water that has been collected.
When steaming, start from the top of the room (drapes, etc.),
When possible, use a larger head attachment for the nozzle, as smaller heads may create too much centralized pressure, thus scattering the bed bugs rather than killing them.
Take your time with the steamer.
After steaming your mattress, allow adequate time for the steam to completely dry before applying a mattress, box spring or pillow encasement.
After steaming, keep an eye out for any signs of bed bugs in the next few days.

Realize that some things are in our control and others not.
Remember, then, that you will be hindered if you suppose that things which are slavish by nature are also free, and that what belongs to others is your own.
Work, therefore to be able to say to every harsh appearance, "You are but an appearance, and not absolutely the thing you appear to be.",
Practice on a constant basis dividing up things between which are inside and outside of your control, and learn that no harm can befall you from things which are outside of your control.

Relax and ponder.

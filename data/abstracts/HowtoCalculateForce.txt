Multiply mass times acceleration.
Convert figures to their SI values.
Keep in mind that weight and mass mean different things in Physics.
Find the force that is required to accelerate a 1,000 kg car at 5 m/s2.
Calculate the force required for an 8 pound wagon to accelerate at 7 m/s2.
Find the magnitude of force acting upon a cart weighing 100 N and accelerating at the rate of 2.5 m/s2.

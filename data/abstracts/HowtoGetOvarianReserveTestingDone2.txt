Undergo a “Day 3 FSH Test.” Perhaps the most common way to assess your ovarian reserve is to determine your levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).
Opt for a “Clomid Challenge Test.” The Clomid Challenge Test is another way to assess your levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and health of your ovarian reserve.
Take an AMH test.
Measure your levels of Inhibin B. Inhibin B is a protein hormone created by your ovaries, and secreted by small, developing follicles.

Plan ahead!,
If you get homework in a class, if possible, try doing it if you have any free time at school.
Start a project on the day or day after a teacher gives it to you.
If you are assigned homework on weekends, try to do it at school if possible, so the whole weekend is free time without any school worries!

,
If you have to do a speech at school do not write a script word for word!

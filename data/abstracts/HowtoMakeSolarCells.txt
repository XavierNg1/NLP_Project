Obtain 2 equal-sized glass plates.
Clean both surfaces of the plates with alcohol.
Test the plate faces for conductivity.
Apply transparent tape to the plates.
Apply a solution of titanium dioxide to the plates.
Remove the tape and separate the plates.
Prepare a shallow dish filled with dye.
Soak the titanium-dioxide-coated plate, coated side down, in the dye for 10 minutes.

,
Clean the other plate with alcohol.
Retest the cleaned plate to find its conductive side.
Apply a thin carbon coating to the conductive side of the cleaned plate.
Take the titanium-dioxide-coated plate out of the dye.
Place the carbon-coated plate onto the titanium-dioxide plate so the coatings touch.
Apply 2 drops of an iodide solution to the exposed coating.
Wipe excess solution off the exposed portions of the plates.

,
Attach an alligator clip to the exposed coated sections on either side of the solar cell.

,
Connect the black wire of the multimeter to the clip connected to the exposed titanium dioxide coating.
Connect the red wire of the multimeter to the clip connected to the exposed carbon coating.
Place the solar cell next to a light source, with the negative electrode facing the source.
Measure the current and voltage generated by the solar cell with the multimeter.

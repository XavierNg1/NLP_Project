Understand what the 'freeze' is.
Understand and learn about what parts of the body are required to be able to do a freeze.
Warm up these required body parts.
Wear heavy clothing.
Make the practicing area safe.
Sit down on the floor and place your hands flat.
Place your head on the ground and hold it there for a while, keeping the hands held down flat.
Depending on if your left or right handed, bend the elbows while keeping the hands flat and the head on the ground.
Understand how to stab.
Stab the right elbow into your pelvis or back towards the joint of the main leg.
Keeping all the weight on your wrists, slowly lift your legs off from the ground, keeping the head flat.
Practice for a while.
Slowly lift the head from the facepalm position.
Practice, practice, practice!,
After days, or maybe weeks, begin exercising the wrists and the other required body parts frequently each day.
It is recommended that you do the freeze position for at least 5 seconds or more before attempting it with one hand.
When you are absolutely comfortable, get into the freeze position again and slowly lift up your left or right hand, depending on what hand you use to write with and either hold it outwards or upwards so you have more chance of maintaining the freeze.
Remember to exercise the wrists each time you try the freeze position with one hand.
Try the freeze for 10 seconds or more.
Show and introduce the move to your family and friends.
Keep progressing and continue to work those wrists.

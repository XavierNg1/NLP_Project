Do your retailer research.
Check all maintenance records: Just like when you buy a car, buying a used recreational vehicle means that you need to make sure to check all the maintenance records.
Look past the appearance: You should be ready to look past the clean and dig deeper when you are considering buying a used recreational vehicle.
Get good advice: It is wise to take the RV you are interested in to someone before you make the final purchase.
Set a budget: Once a budget is set, it is important to stick to it!,
Try before you buy: If you've never driven a motor home or anything larger than a car then it is important that you try before you buy!

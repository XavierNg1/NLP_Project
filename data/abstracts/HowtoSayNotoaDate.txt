Cushion the “no” between compliments about that person.
Say “no” in person or over the telephone whenever possible.
Apologize for not being available.

Consider whether you have any single friends that would be an ideal match for that person.
Explain that you want to become good friends with a person before dating them.
Be mindful of tone and delivery regardless of how you say no to a date.
Use “I” statements when explaining your reason for saying no.

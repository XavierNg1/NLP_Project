Understand music theory.
Recognize that brass instruments are not all in the same key:

Trumpets and cornets are generally in Bb or C, with some variations in Eb, D, A, or G. G pitched trumpets are usually bugles used in drum corps.
Choose a scale.
Compose a simple melody.
Compose a simple chord progression that would fit with the melody.
Apply your melody to your chord progression.
Make sure the whole piece sounds OK, with no unwanted dissonance, etc.),
Transpose the parts to the key of each individual instrument.

Mix the hot tea, whisky and marmalade in a large bowl until the marmalade melts.
Next day heat oven to 160C/fan 140C/gas 3 and grease and double-line the cake tin with non-stick baking paper.
While the cake is still warm, use the skewer to pepper the cake with holes, poking it all the way down.
Soaking in whisky, tea and marmalade makes for the juiciest fruit and a rich, but not overpowering, cake.

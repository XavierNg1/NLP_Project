Look at yourself: next time, stop before passing by a mirror.
Try to read a book: sometimes, you can find a character who really inspires you.
Next time you talk to your friends, try to see how you react to simple or big stuff.
Once you find the real you, try to dress up the way that suits you best and shows your best personalities.
Be attentive.
Be confident.

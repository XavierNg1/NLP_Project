Cry.
One of the hardest parts about having a big fight with your best friend is that when you would normally turn to them when something awful happened, you can't.
Talk to someone.
Write it all down.
Think about the good times, the best memories you have of that person.
Pamper yourself for a day or two, or a week or two, or maybe a month, pamper yourself.
Don't spend too much time grieving your loss.
Get back to real life.
Accept that there's really no remedy to heal a broken heart.
Don't be afraid to start spending more time with other people.

See your doctor.
Share how much pain you're in with your family and friends.
Keep a journal, both for emotional release and for your medical records.
Take a warm (not hot) bath and mix in a small amount of pure sodium or Epsom Salts to relieve stress and soothe your muscles.
When you first injure yourself it's considered an acute injury.
If your pain persists, escalates, is uncontrollable, or is not a normal pain, see a doctor immediately.
Meditation often helps with pain.
Do not self diagnose.

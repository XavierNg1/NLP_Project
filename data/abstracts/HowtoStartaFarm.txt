Start off by drafting up a plan.
Make an extensive estimate of the cost of your farm.
Look at your financial situation before you get too far down the path you have chosen.
Plan on either working off the farm at a day job, or saving enough money to fund your cost of living until you begin to turn a profit on your farm.
Familiarize yourself with the land and the surrounding climate.
Study the topographical features of the land.
Dig a small pit and get some soil samples around the farm.
Vegetation.
Talk to other farmers as well as the owner that is selling the land (if you are buying a farm rather than inheriting one from your parents or grandparents) for information on the kinds of crops and plants that they grew there, when it was seeded, when they were sprayed and when the crop was harvested.
Go to a local agricultural (or county extension) office located in your county, state or province to look at the different reports on the different climatic conditions that have happened over the years for the area you will be farming in.
Do some research on climate history of your area.
If the farm you are buying doesn't have the proper buildings on it already, planning and building may be required to make the farm you are taking over into one you have in mind.
Know what crops are best for you to sow, and what fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides to use on that crop.
Be responsible in choosing the animals you purchase.
Be prepared for the unexpected.

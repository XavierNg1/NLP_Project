Select an outfit.
If you're going to the cinema, to a show or to a concert, wear something a little less formal but still attractive.
If you're going for a picnic or something during the day, wear something more casual, but still looking good.
Whatever your outfit, don't forget to accessorize with some jewelry!

If you're having a sleepover with your mates, going somewhere casual, or just having a night in together, then wear what you want!

Stop and assess the environment and your situation.
Assess how you feel.
If you know that your friends will not take your coming out well, do not come out to them.
Once you do make sure you're in a good environment/situation to come out, do so on your own terms.
Plan what you are going to do and say.
Don't take their reaction personally.
Keep in mind that you have had a long time to get used to the idea of having a sexuality or gender, while your friends just heard about it, give them time to come to terms with it as well.

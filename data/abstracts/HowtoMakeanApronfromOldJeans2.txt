Take a pair of old jeans.
Cut the legs off in a straight line just below the inseam.
Use a seam ripper to open the side seam on the leg.
Keep the leg folded in half.
Place bias tape along the top and bottom edges of the apron.
Cut approximately 20 inches (51 cm) of bias tape in a loop for the neck.
Stitch the bias tape or ribbon onto the edges of the denim, taking out pins as you go along.
Cut out the pockets on the back of the jeans.
Stitch the pocket and any extra embellishments, such as buttons, ribbons, tulle or ruffles, onto the denim apron.

Write down the formula.
Be careful about rounding results partway through.
Calculate your effective interest J.
Note the total number of payments N. The loan term may already specify this number, or you may need to calculate it yourself.
Calculate (1+J)-N. First add 1+J, then raise the answer to the power of "-N." Make sure to include the negative sign in front of the N. If your calculator can't handle negative exponents, instead write this as 1/((1+J)N).In our example, (1+J)-N = (1.004167)-60 = 0.7792


,
Calculate J/(1-(your answer)).
Find your monthly payment.

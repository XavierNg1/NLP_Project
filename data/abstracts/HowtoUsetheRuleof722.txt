Estimate the time it would take to lose half of your money (or its purchasing power in the wake of inflation).
Estimate the rate of decay (R) over a given time span: R = 72 รท T. Enter a value for T, and solve for R. For example:


If the buying power of $100 becomes worth only $50 in ten years, what is the inflation rate during that time?,
Ignore any unusual data.

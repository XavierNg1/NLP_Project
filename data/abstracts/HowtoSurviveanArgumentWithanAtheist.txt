Assess the belief and knowledge of your opponent before diving in.
What made them choose to believe what they believe?,
Get your facts straight.
Ask relevant questions, as well as answer any the atheist might have.
Be honest.

Try to keep an open mind.
Remember the golden rule.
If the above steps don't help, consider dropping the discussion/argument altogether.

Give your full attention to what youâ€™re doing.
Look for the narrowest strip of road.
Be very wary of motorcycles.
Take advantage of traffic jams but keep an eye out for motorcycles trying to squeeze between vehicles.
Take advantage of meridian islands, street light posts, and any barriers.
Have infinite patience.
Look for stop lights, if any, but also consider the hour.
Cross only where you have a clear view of oncoming traffic.
Know what time of day it is.

Choose a thick cut of meat.
Season your steak liberally with salt at least 40 minutes before grilling.
Allow the steak to come to room temperature before grilling.
For best results, choose a hardwood coal, such as mesquite, for your fuel.
Arrange the coals on the grill so that one half contains no coals and the other contains all the coals.
Start the steak on the cool side of the grill, keeping the lid closed.
Flip often.
Use a thermometer to tell you when you're done cooking.
Sear the steak quickly about 15° F before it reaches its ideal temperature.
About 5° F before it reaches its ideal temperature, take the steak from the grill and let it rest.
Enjoy your steak with some summer fare.

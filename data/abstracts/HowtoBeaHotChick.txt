Be proud of your "type".
Have classic beauty (if you do, this give an imprint in mens' minds)?,
Find what looks best on you.
Play up your best features.
Appeal to the opposite gender on a base level.
Let the guys know what you like.
Learn how to carry yourself.
Be confident!,
But it's true: BE YOURSELF.
Finished.

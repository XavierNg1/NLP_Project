Use a high-powered garden hose for small houses, and pressure hose for larger walls.
Plan to work on a sunny day without a lot of wind, if possible.
Work on only one wall or section at a time to prevent streaking.
Start from the bottom, running the hose side to side as you move up.
Spray at eye level whenever possible, preventing water from pushing in between the siding.
Work way from the corners, shooting water away from any gaps.
Consider cleaning around windows and doors by hand.
After you've working completely up from the bottom, rinse the whole wall from the top down.

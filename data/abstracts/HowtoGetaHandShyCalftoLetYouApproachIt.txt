Find a place to sit and something to sit on in the calf's pen.
Bring a book or tablet to read from.
Remain in your spot for 20 to 30 minutes at a time.
Leave your spot and return the next day or a few hours later.
Make feeding time a time your calf will associate you with good things.
When not feeding, and after the calf is comfortable sitting or eating with you, you can try to coax him with a handful of grass or hay, or a taste of pellets or grain.
Once the calf has become comfortable enough to come and eat from the pile next to you, try once again to get him to eat from your hands.
If you finally have the calf eating from your hands, now try to touch him.
Once you have him comfortable with touching him, then you can start training him to come to you.

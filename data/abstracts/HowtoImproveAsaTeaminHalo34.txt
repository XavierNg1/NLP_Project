Set-ups.
Setups relate mainly to a system in which a team can centralize their play around the objective (whether that be in TS or objective games), obviously these change between maps, but there are also major contrasts in objective setups compared to slayer setups but for objective there is often a standard setup which is adopted by the majority of teams relating to a certain game type e.g.
An individual's role in a team setup can vary and often has more emphasis on either slaying or supporting (for objective games- rare in slayer; especially on Amplified >_<, but definitely applicable for Isolation, but note that Isolation is no longer an MLG-standard map), often, particularly in objective games such as oddball there will be someone guarding a certain area and focusing on getting ball time and defending e.g.
Note that during games individuals will switch positions to accommodate shifts in momentum and so are not tied to certain roles.
The main idea is achieving a balance between getting as much geographical scope as possible (not only applying to the view of the map but also power weapon coverage etc.),
Aggressive rushes.
Base raids.
Lock down.
Opening strategy.

Get Beer.
Give every player an 8oz cup.
Set up the table with all the cups in a circle and a 12oz cup in the center.
Fill 8oz cups one half full.
Fill the middle 12oz fully.
Choose someone to go first.
Rotate in a clockwise direction.
Keep the game fast paced.
The first player bounces the ball into the circle of cups.
Who ever’s cup the ball lands in will have to chug their cup.
That player will then play flip cup and will have three chances to land their cup upside down.
If the person fails to land their cup they’re out.
If the ball lands in the center cup everyone chugs their own cup and plays flip cup.
The last person to chug their cup and land their flip cup has to drink the center cup and leave the game.
Play until there is one person left.
Repeat.

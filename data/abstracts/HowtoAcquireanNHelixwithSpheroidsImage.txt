If you have completed the workbook from the article How to Create a Spirallic Spin Particle Path or Necklace Form or Spherical Border, you may SAVE AS that workbook under a new appropriate name having to do with the above helix image you're going to create, and then modify it according to the steps below as read MODIFY/IED or NEW.It helps placing the cursor at cell A14 and doing Freeze Panes.
Â MODIFIED: Create some Defined Name Variables.
MODIFIED: Select cells A1:E2 and Insert Names Create in Top Row.
MODIFIED: Create some more Defined Name Variables.
MODIFIED: Select cells A3:H4 and Insert Names Create in Top Row.
MODIFIED: Input the formulas and values to row 4.
MODIFIED: Select cells A2:G2 and Format Cells Border thick line Top Bottom Sides Center and format number with 4 decimal places.
MODIFIED: Put the entire sheet in font Lucida Fax size 9 by selecting the very top left cell between A and 1 for column and row and thus select the entire worksheet.

There should now be two series: 1) =SERIES(,Data!$E$6:$E$2886,Data!$F$6:$F$2886,1) and 2) =SERIES(,Data!$G$6:$G$2886,Data!$H$6:$H$2886,2).
Finished!

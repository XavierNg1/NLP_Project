Choose whether you are up to having a conversationÂ : take a moment to reflect whether you're really fully ready-physically, mentally and emotionally.
Determine whether the person you wish to have the conversation with is ready, and on the topic you wish to converse on.
Check whether you really care for the other person in context of the topic of conversation--as a boss, a parent, a friend or a partner.
Be clear on the purpose--is it just a selfish purpose, or a manipulative one, or can it really be helpful to both parties.
Check the level of trust between you.
Listen.
Learn to like silence as much as words.
Measure the words you are using.
Continuously watch for how the other person is reacting.
Finally, be true to yourself, genuineness is the most powerful part of yourself you can bring to a conversation.

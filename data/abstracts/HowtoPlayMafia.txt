Select a moderator.
Split up a deck of cards so that there is one card for each person playing (minus 1 for the moderator).
Shuffle the cards and have each player take one card and look at it without showing it to anyone else.
Play the game through day and night rounds (as described below) until either the Mafia have been eliminated, or the number of Mafia and townspeople is equal (in this case, the mafia have complete control over the voting).
Have the moderator begin the night cycle by telling everyone to close their eyes and put their heads down.

When everyone is "asleep," the moderator should instruct the mafia to wake up and choose a victim.
The moderator will instruct the sheriff to wake up.
The doctor will then be instructed to wake up and choose a person to save.
The moderator will then instruct everyone to wake up and will give a short story about whoever the mafia selected, if the Doctor guessed the "dead" person that person will end up staying alive in the short story you come up with about a near-death or death experience and if the person selected by the Mafia isn't saved by the doctor that person will end up dead in the short story.

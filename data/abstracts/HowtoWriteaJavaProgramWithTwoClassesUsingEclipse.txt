Create a Java project.
Highlight the folder you have just created.
Eclipse automatically creates a class in the program window.
It is time to create our main method.
We can now write the main method that calls the method calculateTip from the Calculator class.
Click the "run" button (which looks like a "play" icon) that is located just above your program window.
Eclipse includes an excellent debug feature.
Now click the "debug" icon at the top of the window, right beside the "run" button.
The program will stop at the break point that you have set up.
As you "step" through your program, you can "mouse" over your variables in your program window to see what values they contain during each step.

Make sure you have all 24 masks to get Fierce Deity's Mask.
Do the Swamp, Mountain, Ocean, and Canyon challenges.

Go up to the kid wearing the Majora's Mask and ask to challenge him to a boss battle.
Attack the mask by hitting it from behind.
Shoot about 3 arrows at each to kill them, while at the same time keeping an eye on Majora's Mask so he doesn't pull any sneaky tricks.
Keep avoiding it until he starts spinning again so you can slash him.
Stand in one place and wait for the mask to come near you.
If it doesn't come near you, or you just don't feel like waiting for it to come near you, use a Light Arrow on it to make it fall.
Beware, as this is the hardest form of Majora's Mask.
Stay in one part of the room (facing the mask) and wait for him to whip you, then fire an arrow at him right before he whips you.

,
Use your other forms of Link to stun him.

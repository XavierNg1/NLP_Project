Learn how to play an instrument or sing, if that's your interest.
Learn the basics of recording and, if it's a Music VIDEO, basics of video editing.
Get necessary equipment.
Electric Guitar/Bass: Guitar/Bass.
Acoustic Drums: For this, the easiest and cheapest way to record is using a Condenser Microphone that captures all drums at the same time in the same signal.
Electronic Drums: This can be pretty easy to record.
Vocals: This can be pretty tricky.
Look for Musicians.
Once you've found a good musician, ask him POLITELY to make a collaboration project.
Start recording.
In case everyone's using the same recording software, pick one of you, or it could even be another person not playing the instrument, to edit audio.
If you're planning to make it a video, you'll all need a camera each, and at least one of you has to have a Video Editor Software (A good one).
Upload the video.
After you upload the video, don't forget to mention the other musician(s) in your video description and in your tags.

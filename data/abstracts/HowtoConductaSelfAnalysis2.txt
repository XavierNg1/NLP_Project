Take out a piece of paper and place it in front of you.
Draw five lines vertical across the paper.
Write one of the following terms next to each vertical line: “Extraversion,” “Neuroticism,” "Conscientiousness," "Agreeableness," and "Openness to Experience.” These terms reflect “The Big Five” personality traits.
Decide where you are on each of the five dimensions.
Think about how these five traits influence your personality.

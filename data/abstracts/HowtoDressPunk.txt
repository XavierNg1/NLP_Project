Choose your style.
Master the basics.
Hone your DIY skills.
Choose simple and dirty over clean and chic.
Mix it up.
Don't shy away from metal and other textures.
Think black augmented with bright colors.
Throw in different influences.
Do whatever the heck you want with your hair.
Listen to the music.
Develop something to rebel against.
Don't pay attention to what others think about you.

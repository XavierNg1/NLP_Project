Look for the whitish stalk that is about 6 inches (15 cm) long, with a large, round bulb and white, sac-like volva, a remnant of the tissue that protected the mushroom's gills while it grew, at its base.
Measure the cap of the mushroom and look for a green or yellow color.
Dig down a bit into the soil to find the lower part of the mushroom's stalk.
Look at the flat, wave-like edge of the cap.
Look for many crowded, white gills underneath the cap.
Look for a white spore print by placing the mushroom cap on a piece of paper with the gills facing downward and leaving it overnight.
Smell the mushroom's flesh.

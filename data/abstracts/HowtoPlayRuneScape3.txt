While there is no set thing to do, there are things you can do that would benefit you more.
Health always goes down.
Chopping trees with woodcutting.
Fishing in RuneScape.
Making fire.
Cooking the fish.
Eat the shrimp.
Go to cows and train on them.
Now if you think you are ready go to Al-Kharid...
Do you feel like you need to be more defended?,
Start Questing.
Your first 100K.
What to do after you feel comfortable to get out of the chicken pen and cows.
Never ever trust anyone who asks for your email, if anyone wants you to follow them and get a load of expensive armour and coins.......DON'T they will kill you and then steal your stuff so be warned.

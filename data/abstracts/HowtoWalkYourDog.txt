Be calm and assertive.
Once your dog realizes that you are in control you must get your dog to lie down.
With your dog calm and submissive, you may open the door.
Now you can get on your way.
Keep the lead short, holding your dog beside you, but not lifting him off of the ground.
Keep yourself calm and assertive.
Open the door.
Enter the house first.
Once you have sorted yourself out, you can see to him.
Walk your dog before you give him his food, breakfast, dinner, or just a couple of biscuits.
He may not be a wild dog, he may live in a cozy house in the middle of the city, but he's still a dog.
Let this be a start to a great relationship with your dog.

Consider your budget when choosing bouquets for bridesmaids.
Coordinate your bridesmaids' flowers with your own.
Consult your bridesmaids for their opinions regarding bridesmaid flower choices, although this can be a slippery slope if you have opinionated bridesmaids.
Pick the perfect color.
Choose the right size bouquets for your bridesmaids by coordinating them with the size of the people holding them.
Determine the style of bouquet you want for your bridesmaids by matching it with the style of dress they are wearing.
Remember that your bridesmaids' bouquets need to fit in with the wedding party's floral choices as a whole, and this does not just refer to your bouquet, but also that of the maid of honor, assuming hers is different from the bridesmaids, and the ushers' boutonnieres.

Test yourself on how many push-ups are you able to perform, with perfect technique.
Switch between four different kinds of push-ups to train your body more by giving it something new:


Wide grip push-ups
Diamond presses (triceps and front delts)
Knuckle push-ups (triceps, wrists, and front delts)
Regular push ups, with arms placed on the ground shoulder width apart, keeping the elbows close to the side.

Obtain a roofing slate.
Decide what size you want your slate to be and if you want it to hang vertical or horizontal.
After you have measured your slate to the desired size place the slate(back of slate facing up toward you) on the slate cutter, and line the edge of the blade up with you line to be cut.
If your slate is going to be a hanging slate now is when you want to drill the holes.
Begin to drill the holes.
At this point the slate is pretty dusty, so you will want to wipe it down with a damp cloth.

,
The next step is to put a base coat on the slate.
Draw your design on the slate with a pencil.
Your colors should have been chosen, because now it's time to paint!,
You can leave it the way it is or add words in the grass area.
Once you are finished painting and you are satisfied with your work of art make sure any remaining pencil marks are erased.
Spray slate with clear acrylic spray paint for protection.

,
Wait for it to dry.
If this is a hanging slate then now is when you want to thread it with the leather cord.
Repeat on the other side and then your slate is ready to hang.

Stand back and admire your hard work.

Draw the hands.
Draw the Arm.
Draw hand #2.
From both of the arms, make the body, make it long and some-what curvy.
Draw the tail.
Going up from the arms:


Make a Bump out, Then one in.
The Head: (From the bump in)


Make a little flat line, about the size of 2/3 of the line used for the finger.
Details Count:


Make a mane-like thing running from the bottom of the Bump out right before his head, and start a line from there, go and split his body in half with the line, the bottom half is the Mane-like part, cool, eh?,
Optional:


Putting a large design for the background can be time consuming, so the flame background is optional.
Coloring:


Color only the active layer.

Prepare to load two horses together.
Load the other horse into the trailer first, making sure to tie him or her before leaving.
Come back for your horse next, and be patient.
If your horse loads, tie him/her up and close the trailer.
Unload your horse's friend first, and then your horse.
Work your way towards solo travel.

Fill a glass (about 3 in./7.5cm diameter) about 3/4 full of tap water.
Dissolve a tablespoon of table salt in the water.
Place a thin piece of cardboard (a paper plate will work) over the opening of the glass.
Wrap the other ends of the wires around the positive and negative terminals of a nine-volt battery.
To produce sizable amounts of hydrogen (or oxygen) , continue following these steps; otherwise, you are finished at Step 5.
Submerse the smaller container in the larger glass.
Bring the smaller glass' opening toward the water surface, but, again, be careful not to let the opening come out of the water.
Suspend the smaller glass in this position with the clamp/tape/etc.








,
Insert the HYDROGEN (negative) or OXYGEN (positive) wire into the under-water opening of the smaller container.








,
Leave it until the smaller container is full.

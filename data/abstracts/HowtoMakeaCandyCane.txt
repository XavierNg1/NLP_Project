Preheat the oven at a low temperature, just enough to make it warm, to be turned off when you first add the candy mixture for warming.
Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or use a silicon sheet purpose-made to line a cookie sheet.
Sprinkle a thick coat of powdered sugar on the cookie sheet.
Combine the sugar, corn syrup and water in a saucepan.
Cook the pan over medium-high heat.
Remove from heat.
Add the 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint oil.
Pour half of the mixture onto the cookie sheet.
For the second half of the mixture, add the food coloring.
Let the red mixture cool, just enough to handle (it needs to still be quite hot).
Remove the white mixture from the preheated oven.
Begin shaping.
Place onto a coated cookie sheet, at room temperature, and leave to set until hard.

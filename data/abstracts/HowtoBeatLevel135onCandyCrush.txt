Look for opportunities to create color bombs anywhere on the board.
Work from the bottom up when matching candies.
Focus on clearing the chocolate when there are no opportunities to create color bombs.
Avoid spending time on making striped or wrapped candies for the sake of saving the candies in these matches for color bombs.
Detonate color bombs immediately after youâ€™ve created them to improve your odds for making more color bombs afterwards.

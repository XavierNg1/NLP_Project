Arrange the compost to make an indentation in the top of the pile to hold water.
Turn the compost regularly to ensure proper air circulation which speeds the decomposition process by encouraging beneficial bacteria and fungi growth.
Shred or otherwise cut materials into small pieces before placing them on the compost heap whenever possible.
Learn which items can be composted.
Add straw, pine needles, grass clippings, or plant cuttings if you notice an unpleasant odor.
Add dry chopped or mulched leaves or shredded paper to soak up the excess water if the compost pile is soggy.
Keep a container with a lid and handle under the sink or in the refrigerator.
Cover any exposed pieces of produce with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of grass clippings to discourage flying insects.

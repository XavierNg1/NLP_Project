Decide if you're going to it or not.
Congratulations!,
Decide your party.
Pick out something to wear.
Find your dancing style.
Either create your own dance moves or do the dance that goes with the song, such as getting low or something like that.
If there's bad music or you decide that you're ready to go, just leave early.
When girls cry because nobody has asked them to dance, don't let it ruin your night.

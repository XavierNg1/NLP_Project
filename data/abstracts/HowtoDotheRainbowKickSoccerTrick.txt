Figure out which foot works best for you.
Try doing it standing still.
Put your other foot sideways behind the ball so that the ball is now between the heel of one foot and the inside of your other foot.
Lean forward.
The ball is now up a little on your front leg and you want to kick the ball up with your back leg.
After you get the hang of that try doing the same thing, but with the ball moving.

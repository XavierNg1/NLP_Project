Gather the fondant and knead it until it becomes smooth.
Shape the balls of fondant into solid egg shapes about the size of a large grape and keep it covered with cling film.
Using a small skewer, fork or toothpick, dip the eggs into the cooled melted chocolate and twirl or turn the egg very gently in the air above the bowl to coat.
When the chocolate has set, it will no longer be as glossy and a thin coating will not take long at all.
Alternate Method: If soft fondant is not to your household's taste, buy small ordinary hollow chocolate Easter eggs and prepare some buttercream icing from one of the recipes in or according to your own recipe, (marshmallow is another good filling).

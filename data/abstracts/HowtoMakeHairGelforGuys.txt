Take Quarter cup of whole flax seeds and 2 cups of water in a pan.
Turn on the flame and bring it to boil.

,
Keep stirring the mixture to make it sure to free the bottom of the pan from any sticking flax seeds.

,
While the boiling continues, prepare a container with something to drain your gel.

,
Keep stirring and you will notice that the water will begin to thicken into gel.
Use a plastic tong to take the gel out of the strainer.
Now mix this gel part with the previous one.
Now mix some essential oil, both for the preservative purpose and also for the good hair development.
Now with a wooden stick mix the oils with the gel for a nice smooth finish â€“ it smells great.
Now that you are done, take it in an airtight container and keep it in the fridge for a couple of hours.

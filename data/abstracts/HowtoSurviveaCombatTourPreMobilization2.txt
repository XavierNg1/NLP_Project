The time to prepare is not on the day of Mobilization.
Pre-mobilization separates the "Go's" from "No-Go's" The phase usually starts with a Military Physical and Records check.
When you wear that uniform, always wear your game face on.This is helpful for National Guardsmen/Army Reservist since we always seem to separate themselves from military and civilian.
Attempt to include your family in military functions and Family Support Group functions.I see attempt since some wives do not want anything to do with the military.
Stay away from irrational behavior.Basically, don't act stupid.

Listen to smooth jazz/jazz.
Be calm.
For the wardrobe, wear anything black.
For the hair, wear it out!,
Do not wear any makeup at all.
Write poetry.
Speak mostly in poetry in your life.

,
Be natural as possible.
Your room should be a jazzy place to be.
Read as much books as you can.
Have a journal with all of your poems and doodles.
Have some jazzy friends that are just like you.
Drink coffee!,
When in school, be quiet.
If someone picks on you and calls you names, say 'Your opinion' and keep on saying it.
Perform your poetry as much as you can.
Enjoy the life that you are living.

Choose your song very carefully, selecting one well within your voice range.
Make sure your song isn't one which is commonly used, as your director has probably heard "Tomorrow" from Annie or "On My Own" from Les Miserables or "Good Morning Baltimore" from Hairspray too many times already.
Project your voice!,
Some directors may already have in mind their own interpretation of a character, so you may be at a disadvantage of interpreting it another way.
Be confident!,
Do not worry if you are stopped midway; this is not a bad sign.
Directors look for things off stage too.
Make sure not to have dairy or anything spicy or with seeds in it before you sing.

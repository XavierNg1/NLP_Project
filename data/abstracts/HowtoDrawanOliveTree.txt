Olive trees often have wonderfully gnarled and twisted trunks.
In pencil, sketch a trunk and branches using the curves as a guide.
In pencil, draw the rough shape of the foliage.
Roughly follow the foliage guides with a fine liner.
Go over the trunk and rocks in fine liner, adding lines for a bark texture.
Erase the pencil lines, and you're done!

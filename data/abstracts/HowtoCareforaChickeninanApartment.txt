Create a safe home (coop, run and nestbox) for your chickens, with enough space per bird.
If you live in an apartment then you probably live in a city that has a university of college.
Get the best book on Chickens: The Chicken Health Handbook, and read it.

,
Chickens should have access outdoors for sunshine as much/often as possible.
Clean the coop, run and nestbox every week.
If you purchase "juvenile" birds (about 14-16 weeks old) from a hatchery you will get birds whose beaks have been cut.
They love treats: commercially prepared dried meal worms, apples (peeled and cored), alfalfa (you can grow it yourself from health food sprouting seeds), 12-grain bread with cod-liver oil, yoghurt (plain, no sugar added).
Maintain a safe environment for your chicken - do not leave poisons, cleaning supplies, etc.
Keep your apartment a healthy environment for you and your friends or family, as well.
If you take your chicken for a walk, harness your chicken to avoid traffic.

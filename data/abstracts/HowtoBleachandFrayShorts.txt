Fray them first before bleaching.
Start off by turning the shorts inside out.
Once you're done you may want to thread the bottoms of the shorts, you repeat the same method but just separate the white all the way around the leg hole and leave all the blue to leave a messy look.
Once you've done this they may not have turned out as you wanted and that happens every time!,
Afterward leave the shorts to dry naturally outside.
Once the bleach is in the bowl, put your gloves on and think of where you want the bleach to be, you may want to buy some standard white elastic bands if you want a dotted or tie-dye effect.
Once you're done take the shorts out and place lying down on an old towel or put on the washing line to dry naturally, lay down some newspaper underneath the shorts otherwise the bleach could stain the grass.
You could finish this tutorial and here you have some bleached, distressed shorts!,
If the colour white isn't enough for you, once you bleached your shorts you can use fabric dye to make them a desired colour.
To dye your shorts again just pour the liquid/powder into a bowl and dilute if needed.
Finished.

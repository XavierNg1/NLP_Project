Note that a Billabong Bugs kit is designed differently from other Triops kits.
Make sure that your chosen container is clean and capable of holding three litres of water.

,
Please make sure that it is free from any soap residue.
Open the sachet labelled Magic BugDust™ and empty the entire contents into the aquarium.

,
Fill your tank with 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of 'demineralised'(some times referred to as deionized) water.
Demineralized water and distilled water are produced using different methods.
Open the sachet labelled Bugditioner and add one level scoop of the bugditioner in the water(scoop is provided with the kit).

,
Attach the thermometer to your container.
Leave your container under the lamp for at least 12 – 24 hours before disturbing again.
Feeding - Triops grow incredibly fast, so the amount of food fed to them will vary over the first few days.
On the morning of day three, feed one pellet of food by holding the pellet under the water and rolling it between thumb and forefinger until it has dissolved into a fine smokey cloud.
On day four dissolve one pellet of food as per day three.

,
On day five dissolve one pellet of food in the morning and one in the evening.

,
On day six repeat as per day five.

,
On day seven count the remaining number of Triops australiensis hatch-lings that are in the tank and place a food pellet in for each one.
Remove 1/3 water from the tank.Place one level scoop of Bugditioner™ into the remaining water

,
Start adding water to the tank gradually.
As your Bugs grow they might require more food than just one pellet each per day.
Your Bugs may also enjoy some variety in their diet, so why not try feeding them some of these treats: a frozen pea, a frozen corn kernel, a small cube of carrot (about the size of a pea), a small amount of lettuce…Whatever you choose to give your Bugs, make sure it is washed thoroughly to ensure it is free from any pesticides or other chemicals.

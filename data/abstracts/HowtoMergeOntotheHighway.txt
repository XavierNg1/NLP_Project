Proceed to the highway and prepare to enter the acceleration lane.
Be cautious when first entering the lane.
Try to accelerate rapidly enough so that you are virtually very close to interstate speed before you merge with other traffic.
Look for the merge area, which is after the solid white lane has ended.

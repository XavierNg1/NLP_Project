Measure the length from the floor of the closet to the closet rod.
Cut off the flaps of all of your boxes with sharp scissors or a box cutter.
Lay your boxes side by side on a long table, with the openings facing toward you.
Measure and cut 2 pieces of fabric that are the length of the side and 1 that is the length and width of the back.
Turn all of your boxes so that the same side is facing toward you.
Allow the glue to dry completely, and then carefully turn the boxes toward the back.
Cut 2 small slits in the top of the top box in your organizer; 1 near the rear and another near the front.
Place the organizer in your closet.
Loop the rope over the top of the closet rod, and bring it through the front slit.
Place a different type of clothing in each cardboard box.

Get your suppliesÂ : You will need a clear bottle, scissors or a knife, and a little environment with some grass and a rock (optional) and of course your ants.
If you are using the bottle method, put holes in the top with the knife or scissors.
Catch the ants.
Feed them every day, preferably every 6 hours or so.

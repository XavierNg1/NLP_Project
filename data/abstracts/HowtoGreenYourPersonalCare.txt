Take a look at the ingredients of your shampoos, conditioners, moisturizers, hair gels, lipsticks, mascaras and perfumes.
Understand the problems you face when using many everyday commercial personal care products:


many beauty products are not well regulated
health and beauty products top advertising breaches (they don’t do what they claim they do)
many use varying mixtures of synthetically produced chemicals
many of these synthetic chemicals have not been approved by regulation authorities, but find their way into products and onto shelves through loopholes in regulations
as much as a third of personal care products contain at least one chemical linked to cancer
mineral oil and petroleum are the basic ingredients in many cosmetic products – these have their origins in fossil fuels
the meanings of "natural" and "organic" are generally not regulated and can mean whatever the company wants them to mean!,
Choose organic products.

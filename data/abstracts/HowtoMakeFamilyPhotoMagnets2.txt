Crop your photos so that they are square.
Print off the square photographs on your printer, using photo paper.
Aim for the photo to be approximately 3 inches by 3 inches (7.6 by 7.6 cm) - approximately the size of a standard Polaroid photo image.
Buy magnet sheets at a craft store or online.
Cut the magnet sheets into sizes of 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) wide and 4.5 inches (11.4 cm) tall.
Place double stick tape on the back of your photo in 2 to 4 places.
Place the photograph approximately 1/4 inch from the top and sides of the front of the magnet sheet.
Write information about your family members on the bottom of the photo magnet.

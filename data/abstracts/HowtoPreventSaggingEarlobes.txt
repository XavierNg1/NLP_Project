Only wear earrings when you're going out or have company for whom you want to look nice.
Try wearing simple, light, stud earrings if you can.
Wear earrings made out of plastic.
Keep big, heavy earrings in your ears for as little time as possible, if you really must wear them.
Do not stretch piercings unless you intend to wear the larger size of jewellery permanently.

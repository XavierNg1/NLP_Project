If you already have a style in mind, go for it!,
Understand that a standard lightsaber is the best option for most situations.
Choose a saberstaff if you prefer a more aggressive style, or if you want to maximise defensive coverage.
Go for a shoto or guard shoto if you can't use a full size blade, or as a second blade in Niman or Jar'kai.
Choose paired blades if you want the best of both worlds.
Use a curved-hilt lightsaber for elegance and precision.
Go for a crossguard lightsaber!,
Choose a lightclub if you're a big fella.
Go for a lightwhip if you don't care for defense.

Familiarize yourself with the 5 main branches of Judaism.
Understand that in Chasidic and Orthodox Judaism, Jews generally wear modest attire that is not overly revealing.
Be aware that Chasidic and Orthodox Jewish men and women sit separately in their synagogues.
Be aware that in other synagogues, everyone sits together, and the prayer books have both Hebrew and English, so you can read the English while listening to the Hebrew.
Know that Jews stand during certain parts of the service, such as when the Ark of the Covenant is open and for specific prayers.
Dress appropriately.
Don't make noise during the services.

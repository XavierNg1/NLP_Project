Dress and accessorize like older girls that you look up to.
Go to stores like JCPenney, Hollister, Aeropostale, Abercrombie & Fitch, Forever 21, and Deb, if your family can afford to go to those places.
Have variety in your wardrobe, but keep comfy home clothes for when you are PMSing.
Wear some make up.
Don't keep your hair the same way every day, such as simple, straight down.
If you're allowed to do your nails, either do it at home or go all out with a salon treatment.

If your family can afford it, buy Uggs or Airwalk shoes.
Try to get a good quality purse that won't break on you, either from Victoria Secret or Coach.
Try to get ankle socks (the long ones can be itchy and sweaty).
It doesn't matter which underwear you pick, but don't wear kiddie stuff, because of the locker room.
Act mature.
Get a Part Time Job.
Open up a Bank Account.

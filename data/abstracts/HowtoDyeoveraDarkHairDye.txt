Wash your hair.
Buy a good quality hair colour remover.
Don't bleach your hair.
So, pop in your colour remover, if you have black hair you'll end up with a mousy brown, brown hair and you'll end up orangey.. but hey, we're getting rid of that black!,
Select your new hair colour (Wisely!),
Because now you NEED to give your hair some major TLC, splash out on some really lush conditioner, and a really mild colour preserving shampoo.

Know that one good, repeated guitar lick is all you need to start a song.
Re-write the guitar riff for a new chorus, giving the song two distinct parts.
Use single-note lines and riffs to spice things up.
Drape the edge of your picking hand on the back of the strings to palm mute.
Keep solos short and speedy.
Experiment with other punk subgenres when writing instrumentals.

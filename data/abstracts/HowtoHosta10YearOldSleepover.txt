Decide who you're going to invite.
Remember to include the time, date and venue on your invitations, plus an RSVP date.
Decide which room you'll sleep in.
It's fun to camp on the ground on mattresses and blow-up beds.
If you don't have a television in your sleeping venue it's a good idea to have one, even if it's just a small portable one.
You'll need lots of snacks and drinks, like popcorn (make sure everyone likes your chosen flavour otherwise it's not fair on them) and sweets (e g jelly laces, Haribos, chocolate bars etc) for snacks and for drinks Coca-Cola, Fanta, Lemonade, Dr Pepper etc and for those that don't like fizzy drinks have an array of fruit juices such as apple, orange or blackcurrant.
Make sure you get a really early night before the night of the sleepover so you're not tired the next day- you'll find yourself dropping off before your head hits the pillow!

,
On the day, greet your guests politely and nicely and show them round your house if they are unfamiliar.
Watch films and have loads of fun.
At around midnight, if people are getting tired, let them sleep.
For food, You don't have to be fancy.
When you settle down, make sure all the popcorn bowls and sweet bowls and cups are off the beds so you don't roll on them in the night.
In the morning, if you wake up at 7:00 am or earlier, go back to sleep or quietly do something else.
At around 11:30, if some of your guests are still sleeping, this is a good time to wake them because you'll have no time left together!,
If it's a sunny day, it's a good idea to play in the garden to wake you up.
If you do go to the park, make sure you get back home in time for your guests to leave.
When your guests leave, be sure to thank them for coming and if it was a birthday, for your presents.
Once the final guest has left, you need to clean up.

Purchase a large fish tank.
Purchase a second tank for breeding.
Use any filter for the main tank, and a sponge filter for the breeding tank.
Install an air pump in each tank.
Cover the bottom of each tank with sand or gravel.
Fill the tanks with appropriate water.
Keep the water at 65-82º F (18-28º C).
Add live plants and hiding places.
Buy high quality shrimp for pets, and feeder shrimp if you're breeding them as animal food.
Introduce the shrimp to the new water slowly.
Feed the shrimp tiny amounts of fish food.
Change the water once every week or two.
Be cautious about adding other fish to the tank.
Check that you have both males and females.
Look for females carrying eggs.
After a few days, transfer females carrying eggs to the breeding tank.
Wait 21–24 days until the eggs hatch.
Transfer the female back to the main tank.
Feed them small amounts of specialized tiny food.
Feed them the same food as regular shrimp once they've grown legs.
Transfer the shrimp back to the tank once fully grown.
Don't transfer the females if it causes the eggs to fail.
Keep watching if the young shrimp won't eat.
If all the shrimp die after putting them in the tank, use different water or introduce the shrimp more slowly.

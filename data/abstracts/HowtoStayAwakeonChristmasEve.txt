Get something to sleep on.
Find a good hiding place!,
When your parents tell you to go to bed, pretend like you are doing just that.
Wait till you hear the door shut.
Get up and start arranging your spot and what you will do before they get back.

,
Hide.
If you want to see your gift, get binoculars.
Be surprised about your gift even if you sneakily saw it.
You will have needed to set up everything before Christmas comes.
You will need food with lots of sugar.
Don't drink too much liquid because your parents will hear if you flush the toilet.
Simply fall asleep!

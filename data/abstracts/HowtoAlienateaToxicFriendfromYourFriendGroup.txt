Sound out the rest of the group.
Start avoiding the unwanted friend in every way possible.
Create physical distance between the rest of the friends and the unwanted friend.
Take a breather and reconveneÂ with your desired friend group (minus the unwanted friend).
Be politely clear about the distancing.
After the confrontation has subsided and the unwanted friend ends texting in an assumed huff or exits the apartment/dorm/house in an obvious huff, you are free of the friend.
Enjoy the more suitable group of friends you and the desired individuals painstakingly created.

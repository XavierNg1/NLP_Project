Consider a simpler, safer alternative for a science experiment.
Add ethanol to your salt and sugar mixture.
Mix the solution with a spoon or a stir stick to dissolve the sugar.
Pour the alcohol solution through a very fine strainer, and into the new container.
Wait for the alcohol to evaporate, or create a steam bath.
Place the sugar and ethanol mixture in the open bowl on top of the steam bath.
Continue the process until all the alcohol has evaporated.

Get a wooden dowel that is between 10 and 13 inches (25.4 and 33.02 centimeters).You can find them at craft stores; they are usually sold in packs.
Sand down one end of the dowel so that it is rounded.
Use hot glue to build up the handle part, if desired.
Consider hot gluing a bead or button to the base of your wand.
Use a hot glue gun to draw designs on the rest of the wand, if desired.
Paint your dowel with a base color using acrylic paint and let it dry.
Add some weathering.
Let the paint dry, then seal the wand to make it last longer.

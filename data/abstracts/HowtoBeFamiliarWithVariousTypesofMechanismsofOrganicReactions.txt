Organic reactions can usually proceed in one of two ways.
The observation of these highly reactive and highly unstable carbon species is possible through special spectroscopic techniques such as mass spectroscopy.
Reactions that proceed in a stepwise manner usually are not specific and do not give single product.
The subject of reactive intermediates in organic chemistry is a whole topic of organic chemistry that is taught at the graduate level at universities that have strong program in this discipline of science.
The investigation of the mechanisms of organic reactions uses also physical methods such as kinetic measurements of reaction rate.
Organic compounds usually have good thermodynamic stability that is remarkable if we compare it with compounds of other atoms than carbon.
Two main common intermediates that are encountered in many organic reactions are the electron deficient carbocation species and the negatively charged carbon ion that is called carbon ion.
Intermediates are seen for example in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions of benzene and its derivatives.
Aromatic compounds are unusually stable from the thermodynamic point of view.
Theoretical modeling of chemical transformations can be very useful in determining if a reaction pathway will be favorable or not and whether the reaction is likely to have intermediate structures or not.

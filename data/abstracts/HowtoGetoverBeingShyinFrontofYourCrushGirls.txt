Figure out how you look when you're around your crush and you could even ask some friends how you are whenever you're around him.
Know and remember if your crush sees you like that, he may know you like him.
Whenever you approach your crush, whether you bump into him at a store, at school with friends or by yourself, or just anywhere, stay and remain calm and focus your attention on something else.
If you think about your crush a lot and maybe even daydream about him, slowly start thinking of your crush less and less everyday, so that when you see him, it won't be as big of a deal.
Once you've gotten over your shyness or feel more comfortable around your crush, stay POSITIVE.
Have your friends make you feel better and help you with your crush (Especially the ones you trust).
Find something you have in common with him and if it is an activity, ask them how it is going.
Pretend that he is just a normal dude.

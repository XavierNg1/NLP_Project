Identify a race or special election you would like to research.
Look at who can vote in the election and where the voters vote.
Make a simple sample frame.
Add the total number of potential voters up: 1000+1200+900+900= 4000

,
For each district, create a percentage:


District A: 1000 voters/4000 = 25%
District B: 1200 voters/4000 = 30%
District C: 900 voters/4000 = 22%
District D: 900 voters/4000 = 22%

,
Decide how many voters to sample.
Divide the sample by two and ask equal numbers of men and women voters.
Set down the rules with the data gathering team.
Prepare a media plan to distribute the results.
On election day, assign the teams to collect the data.

,
Tabulate the data and make an estimate of the results.

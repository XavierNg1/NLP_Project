Part your lips.
Touch your teeth together.
Make sure your tongue can move.
Look at yourself in the mirror.
Breathe normally.
Practice easy letters.
Work on tough letters.
Say words.
Emphasize “ing” when saying a word that starts with a problematic letter.
Avoid words that end with “able.” Because of the complex sound and the inclusion of the problematic “b,” you should avoid using words that end in “able.” Instead, substitute different words for words that end with “able.”


Instead of saying “agreeable,” say “compliant.”
Instead of saying “adorable,” say “darling.”
Instead of saying “comfortable,” say “contented.”,
Speak entire sentences.
Write a monologue and practice it.
Talk to your friends.
Record yourself.

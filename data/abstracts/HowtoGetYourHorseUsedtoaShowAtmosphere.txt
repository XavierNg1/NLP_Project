Consider bringing your horse to the first show just to be there.
Stay with your horse at all times.
Try to park your trailer/van in a quieter spacey area of the park with more space if you cannot stall your horse.
Unload your horse and lead him directly to his stall and give him some hay.
Head on over to the show.
Deal with negative reaction quickly.
Lead him around and let him get used to things.
Lounge your horse in an area with horses around, but not in it.
Before your class, ride in a quiet arena.
Finally, join a different ring where other horses are also being ridden.

Peel, slice, and chop the cucumbers.
Grate your cucumber chunks into fine shreds.
Pour 2 cups (500 milliliters) of water and 2 tablespoons (28 1/3 grams) of sugar into a medium-sized saucepan.
Add the grated cucumber to the boiling sugar water.
Remove the cucumber mixture from the heat.
Transfer the cucumber mixture to a blender and add 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of honey.
Spread cheesecloth inside of a large glass bowl.
Carefully pour the pureed cucumbers into the cheesecloth.
Once the puree is inside cheesecloth, bring the sides of the cheesecloth together into a tight bundle.
Allow the cucumber juice to drain out of the cheesecloth and into the glass bowl.
Add salt, to taste, into the cucumber juice.
Serve the cucumber juice in glasses, either chilled or with ice.

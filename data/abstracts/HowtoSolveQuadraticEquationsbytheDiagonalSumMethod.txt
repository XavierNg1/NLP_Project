Recall that a quadratic equation has two roots.
Recall the Rule Of Sign For Real Roots.
Assume that the quadratic equation has two real rational roots and express them as fractions in reduced terms with positive denominators.
Factor both a and c. Compose all pairs of fractions whose numerators multiply to c (r.t = c) and whose denominators multiply to a (s.u = a).
Check the diagonal sum of each candidate.

Don't go on and on about your latest problem when talking to people.
Don't be moody all the time.
Don't throw temper tantrums.
Don't be desperate for attention.
Throw yourself into the arts.
Don't be upset if you don't get the part you want in a play.
Make the best of what you can with each role.
Be yourself!,
Just keep in mind that with great power comes great responsibility.

In a mixer, combine flour and salt and combine thoroughly on a slow setting.
Combine water, oil, and vinegar together separately.
Continue mixing with the paddle attachment until the dough gets soft, about 1 minute.
Switch out the paddle attachment with a hook attachment and continue mixing for about 10 minutes.
Remove the dough from the mixer and continue to knead for 2 more minutes by hand.
Use about 1 teaspoon of olive or vegetable oil to coat the entire dough.
Cut the phyllo dough into roughly equal portions.
Start rolling circular pieces of dough on a rolling pin or dowel.
Continue rolling the dough on the pin or dowel by wrapping the dough around the dowel and rolling back and forth.
Unwrap the dough by rolling the dowel back towards you.
Roll, rotating after each big back and forth, until the dough becomes translucent.

,
Take the translucent dough into your hands and stretch apart very carefully to get an even thinner dough.
Place each finished sheet of phyllo on top of each other on a well-floured baking sheet.
Repeat until your 7 - 10 layers are fully stacked.
Enjoy.

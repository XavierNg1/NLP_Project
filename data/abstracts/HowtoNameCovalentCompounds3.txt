Check whether the acid contains an oxygen.
If there is not an oxygen, use the "hydro- (name) -ic acid" formula.
If there is an oxygen, first name the oxygen anion.
Figure out how many anions are in the same series as yours.
Use the name of the oxygen anion to find the name of the acid.
Acid name exceptions.

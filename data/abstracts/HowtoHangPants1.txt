Get a standard clothes hanger.
Consider adding a strip of velvet, moleskin, or hot glue across the bottom bar.
Fold the pants in half vertically.
Hook your hanger over something stable, such as a rod.
Drape the pants over the horizontal bar in the hanger.
Adjust the pants so that they balance right and don't slide off.
Place the hanger inside your closet.

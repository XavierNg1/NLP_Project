Stand about 3 feet (0.9Â m) directly in front of your horse.
Look your horse in the eye.
If your horse does not respond to your gentle shaking, begin to shake a little harder.
Wait several seconds, then gently shake the rope again.
Little by little, as your horse begins to grasp the concept, you can ask for more steps backward.

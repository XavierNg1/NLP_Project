Fill a plastic bottle with the beverage you want to carbonate.
Add yeast.
Cap and shake the bottle.
Test to see if carbonation is complete by squeezing the bottle forcefully with your thumb.
Put the bottle in the refrigerator to stop the fermentation process until you're ready to drink it.
Pour the drink carefully, leaving the dormant yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle.

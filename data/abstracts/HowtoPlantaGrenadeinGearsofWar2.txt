Pick up and select a grenade from your weapons inventory by pressing the X button on your Xbox 360 controller when you're near them, and then pressing UP on your D-Pad to select them.
Move next to a wall, door or other standing object capable of having a grenade planted to it and make sure you are facing it.

,
Plant the grenade by pressing the B button on your controller, much in the same way as if you were tagging an opponent.
Move well away from the area and wait for an opponent to set it off.
Get tactical with your grenade planting.

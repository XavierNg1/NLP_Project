Get a small leftover container from the grocery store (or your own supply).
Collect all the silica gel capsules that are lying around in your medicine bottles, dog food (yes, some dry dog food comes with them), or other items that need to stay dry.
Put silica gel capsules into the leftover container.
The silica gel will need to be refreshed periodically (maybe once a month).

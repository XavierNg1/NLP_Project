Plan for full-time care.
Get a crate, preferably one with rollers on the bottom.
Purchase a liner for the bottom of the crate for the times that your dog has an accident.
Buy or rig a comfortable bed to put in the crate for your dog, keeping in mind that your dog will be spending a lot of time in there for the next several weeks.
Keep water and food inside of the crate.
Place the crate in an area where your dog can see you.
Give pain medication.
Carefully follow your veterinarian's orders on when your dog can walk and exercise.
Diligently monitor the surgery site.
Your vet may have given you some antibiotic medication to give your Dachshund.
Make sure your dog wears his cone collar.
Use a belly swing.

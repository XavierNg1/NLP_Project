Bend the chicken wire fencing into the shape that you need.
Set the wire frame down on a piece of plastic.
Spray the cans of insulation onto the wire frame.
Add water to your grout mix, making it a little bit thinner than you normally would (about like cake batter).
Take your strips of burlap, and one at a time, dip them in the grout mix.
Lay these strips down on your wire and foam frame.
After all the grout has had time to dry, your rock will have its shape and details, but it will be one solid color.
Use a clear coat matte spray paint to seal it.

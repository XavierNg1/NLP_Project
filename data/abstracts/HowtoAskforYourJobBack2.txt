Resolve your own issues first.
Apologize to your previous employer and boss if needed.Unless you left for a legitimate reason (e.g. moving away for college), by now you are thinking that something has changed between when you quit and now.
Revise your résumé or curriculum vitae.Anytime you leave a job you should revise your résumé or vitae.
Submit your updated résumé or vitae to your previous employer.
Be prepared to answer questions about why you quit.Try to focus on your own change as a person rather than negative aspects of your job.
Humble yourself before your boss.

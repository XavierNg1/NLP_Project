Choose where you plan to kayak according to the type of kayak you have, your risk/reward level, and your waterman abilities.
Develop a float plan.
Carry a life jacket, signaling device, and a battery-powered running light that can go on the sea kayak’s bow.
Pack enough water for the trip, usually 1 gallon (3.8 L) per person, but it's better to pack more than you think you need in case the trip is delayed.
Keep a bilge pump or large sponge within reach.
Consider carrying an anchor.
Follow the weather report before going kayaking and know the depth of the water you will be in.

Before engaging in combat, go into sneak mode and hide away a bit.
If you cannot get a good analysis of the enemy, then it's best to go into combat and watch its strengths and weaknesses as it fights you, and then pick on its weaknesses.
If you're close to death and don't have any healing potions or spells on you, then it's best to go on the defensive.

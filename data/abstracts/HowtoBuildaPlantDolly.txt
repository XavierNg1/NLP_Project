Choose a barrel.
Make a paper template for the dolly platform.
Transfer the template to a piece of plywood.
Cut the plywood with a jigsaw.
Screw 4 casters onto the dolly close to the edge (about 1 inch or 2.5 cm seems right – if they are too close the center, the dolly will be less stable).
Drill a few drainage holes in the plywood.
Coat the dolly with a weatherproof coating to reduce water damage.
Drill some drainage holes in the bottom of the barrel.
Stand the barrel on the dolly.
Create extra drainage by drilling additional holes into the dolly through the holes in the bottom of the barrel – by aligning them you will have a direct drainage channels that should minimize pooling of water on the dolly.
Put stones over the drainage holes, then fill the barrel with soil, plant and water as desired.

Read.
Be a good example to your children.
Teach them to be healthy and widen their tastes.
Love and respect your children.
Never go by the saying "If you want to act like a child, I'll treat you like one".
Educate them.
Let them be themselves.
Make older siblings feel involved in the younger siblings lives.

Assemble the supplies needed.
Make the flowers first.
Loop the wire up through one side set of aligned holes, then bring it down the other side (only two sets of holes is needed).
Measure enough of the wire length that you wrapped the wire around to create a stem.
Repeat for more flowers on stems.
Create the container for the flowers.
Arrange the button flowers in the container.

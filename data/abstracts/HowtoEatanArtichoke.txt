Don't boil the artichoke.
Drain them upside down.

Take the outer leaves off one by one and hold like a potato chip.
Coat the tip (the part that was attached to the heart of the choke) in whatever dip has been offered.
Gently nibble or scrape off the tender bits of the bottom of the leaf by putting the leaf in your mouth, closing your teeth on it, and pulling the leaf outwards.
Discard the leftover leaves in a container or in a pile on your plate.

Continue until you get to the smaller center leaves that don't have much meatiness to them.
Pull off the center leaves.
Remove the choke using gentle strokes with a spoon.
Eat your heart out.

Make a list.
Use bright colors and one statement pieceÂ : Sometimes less is more.
Shop at the dollar store: Look, you don't have to buy the new set of fine china.
Add Christmas lights.
Location, location, location: It's much easier to decorate a park gazebo then a garage.
Buffet, not meals: Which might be obvious to most.
Cut the list: You can't have 110 guests, how about 10?,
Forget it!

Gather a task squad (this can be just you and a friend or you and a group of friends).
Prepare.
Go somewhere where people gather to talk, whether it's a pub or a comic convention!,
Get out and talk to people.
Just repeat the above, never try to push further from your end, but always respond, if they ask a question, or follow their answer to your question with a question, then respond.
We now need to up the ante a bit - Take the conversation to the next level - you should now be proficient in the meet & greet stage of obtaining a date, if not repeat the above until you are.

So, you have said hello, asked if they are having a good night, you have pre-qualified the person, you like the way they look and they seem approachable.
From here your natural conversation skills can kick in, conversation is as simple ABC.
Once you find yourself in the flow of conversation, you need to add assertion to your game: "It has been great talking, can I have your phone number/Blackberry pin/email address?",
So by now you should be sat at home after your night out, with updated contact information on your phone or a scribble on a piece of paper - you are probably asking "when should I contact them?",
If you met on a Friday night, a casual text message on the Sunday afternoon would be appropriate "Hi, its insert name from the Pub, nice meeting you on Friday, I hope you had a good evening.",
You need to spend the next 5 - 10 text messages reigniting that initial spark - refresh their memory as to why they were speaking to you in the first place.

Now you need to pop the question, no not marriage, you need to propose a meet-up.
Date prep should be the same as before, groomed, clean teeth, look fresh, feel fresh.
So you are here, you have achieved what not so long ago seemed the impossible.
The kiss?

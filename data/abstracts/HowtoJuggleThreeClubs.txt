Get some good quality clubs to start with.
Start like you started juggling three balls.
Try to get one good solid flip, and aim for consistent throws.
Practice with just your dominant hand until you get good, consistent throws.

,
To add in the second club, hold it in your left hand between the middle and ring fingers, and just leave it there.
Once you are again getting good consistent throws, add in the second throw just like you did with balls.
STOP!,
Once you can reliably catch both clubs, add in the third.
Now for that third toss.
Now you have done three throws!,
Once you have some success with three throws, try four, then STOP!,
That's it!

Start with a computer that you are reasonably confident is malware and virus free.
Using private browser mode, go to a bitcoin paper wallet creation site.
Once bitaddress.org loads, turn off the internet on your computer.
Move your mouse around the screen wildly as instructed by the site.

Keep going until you see that you've created two QR codes and large strings of apparently random numbers and characters as seen in the photo.
Store your paper wallet somewhere secure.

Follow the instructions in Part 1 above and then click "Paper Wallet".

Click the checkmark next to "BIP38 Encrypt" and enter a passphrase.
Click "Generate".
Plug your computer directly into your printer and print your paper wallets.
Erase all copies of your paper wallet from your computer and printer before you reconnect to the internet.
Congratulations!,
Before putting any significant amount of money in your wallet, verify that you can successfully decrypt your wallet.

Create an online wallet that supports BIP38 encryption.

Go to "Settings" then "Addresses" then click "Manage Addresses".

Press the QR code scanner to bring up the QR code reader on your webcam.
Enter your passphrase.
Send Bitcoin to one of your wallets.
Verify your funds arrived in your wallet.
That's it!,
Store the printout of your paper wallet with the private keys in a secure location.
Recognize that bitcoin paper wallets are optimal for long term storage, but not frequent spending.

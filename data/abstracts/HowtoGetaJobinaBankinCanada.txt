It’s true that it is very difficult to enter into any professional field here in Canada.
The basic course for all these careers is the CSC®, for which the cost to enroll directly is around $1000 and you have one year from enrollment to pass both part 1 & 2.
CSI® online study on the website, review the two textbooks, and visit websites of related topics; study on your own, at your own pace, but you will find the year pass by quickly and you will have hardly studied more than a few chapters!

,
Classes for the CSC® course are provided by several colleges; they have full time and part-time, evening courses as well.
Join a financial firm that will sponsor your courses; in this way you benefit from discount of the course cost, get free training, guidance, and interact with people working in the financial sector.
Start working as a teller or in the back-office of a bank and then do the course; you will earn while you study, and have a good opportunity to understand the products & terminology in a practical sense.
Enroll CSC® on your own and get a good tutor to guide you, maybe 3-4 hours over every weekend, so you can be ready to take the first exam in 2-4 months time, and have clear understanding of the topics and concepts by discussion.
If you are a new immigrant, ask your Govt.
Visit career bridge.ca for internship options to enter the financial field, if you have international experience in the financial sector.

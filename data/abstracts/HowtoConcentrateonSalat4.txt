Donâ€™t treat prayer as an isolated act of worship, but part of your lifestyle.
Keep your lifestyle pure and clean.
Begin to schedule your work according to prayers.
Try to go to bed early so that you do not miss your morning prayer.

Too much engagement in worldly affairs hinders the mind to be attentive inside the prayers.

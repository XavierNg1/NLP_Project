Draw a line parallel to side BC of the triangle that passes through the vertex A. Label the line PQ.
Write the equation angle PAB + angle BAC + angle CAQ = 180 degrees.
State that angle PAB = angle ABC and angle CAQ = angle ACB.
Substitute angle PAB and angle CAQ in Equation 1 for angle ABC and angle ACB (as found in Equation 2 and Equation 3) respectively.
Define the angle sum property.

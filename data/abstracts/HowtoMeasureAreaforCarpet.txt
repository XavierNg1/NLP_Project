Draw a diagram of the room you want to carpet.
Draw lines on the diagram to make an oddly shaped room into shapes that can easily have areas calculated such as rectangles, squares and triangles.
Measure the sides of the room using a measuring tape, and write the numbers in on the diagram where they belong.

,
Calculate the areas of the individual shapes you divided out, making sure you use the same unit of measurement with all of them, and then add them together.
Convert square feet into square yards by dividing by 9 if you live in the United States.
Round your number up if you feel any doubt because it would be better to have extra scraps to use in closets and on stairs than to come up short.

,
Decide which direction the carpet is going to unroll and be seamed together across the room.

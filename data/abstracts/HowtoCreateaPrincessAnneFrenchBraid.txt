First, make sure that you wash your hair to remove any hair products from your hair.
Let hair dry.
After your hair is dry, brush your hair so that there are no tangles.
Once your hair is untangled, use a comb to part your hair down the middle.
Tie off the right hand portion of hair with a hair band or clip.

,
On the left side, gather a section of hair that is halfway between the middle of the forehead and the left ear.
Cross the left strand over the middle strand.
Then using your pinkie finger grab a small portion of the hair on the left side (this should be right by the ear).
Cross the new, larger right strand over the middle strand.
Continue steps 7-9 repeatedly creating a French braid that is above the left ear and below the center part until the braid has reached the nape of the neck.

At This point use a hair tie to tie off the braid at the nape of the neck.

,
Then, untie the right portion of hair.
Repeat stepsÂ  7-10 but on the right side of the head.

,
Now you should have two equally sized braids, one on the left and one on the right.
Now set the strands of the left braid into the three spaces of your fingers.
At this point separate the right braid's strands and put them in between the spaces of your fingers.
Taking your right hand, flip it over holding the strands in between your fingers and match the strands with the left hand.
Remove your right hand from the newly combined three strands.
Using the three strands in your left hand braid a basic braid using the rest of the left over hair.

,
At the end of the braid tie off with a hair tie.

Orkney also known as the Orkney Islands (and sometimes "the Orkneys", a name which locals disdain) is an archipelago in northern Scotland, 16 km (10 mi) north of the coast of Caithness.
If you live in Camden, it is not too far from Camden Town to Euston station.
Head north-west towards Barnby St, turn right to Barnby St then turn right to Eversholt St A4200.
Take a taxi and tell driver to take you to Gills Bay which is situated about 3 mi (4.8 km) west of John O' Groats with the community of Gills close by, has one of the longest stretches of low-lying rock coast on the northern shores of Caithness.
Board a ferry at the harbour and within an hour or an hour and half you will find yourself on the Orkney Islands.

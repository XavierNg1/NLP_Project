Know who your audience is.
Read it like a story: A logical progression of ideas will make for a clean presentation.
Give the whole picture, then zoom in: As Robert Anholt says in Dazzle 'em with Style: You can't lead your audience anywhere if you haven't given them a reason for following you.
Use lots of examples: You can't use enough examples, because they are going to be the parts that the audience remembers most.
Smile!,
Focus on the intangibles: audience attention, hand movements, posture, tone of voice.
Remember who your audience is: If you find there is a large diversity of both knowledge, experience, and personality traits in the room, then please don't feel like you have to completely change the style and delivery of your talk.
Keep a critical eye: This is mainly for the sake of your own work and presentation layout.
Know your topic: This doesn't mean that when you get up at the front of the room you have to tell them everything you know.
Get plenty of rest beforehand: Maximizing the amount of healthy rest you get beforehand will remove the distraction of tiredness and allow you channel the passion and focus you have for your subject and topic at hand.
Practice, practice, practice.
Post-Presentation: Follow up with people who had additional questions that you didn't get to cover in the lecture.

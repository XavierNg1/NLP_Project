Untangle any kinks in a flapper chain if it isn’t fitting back into hole after a flush.

Adjust the length of the flapper chain so that it doesn’t flop into the hole with the flapper, preventing it from sealing.
If it's a wire, move the wire connected to a flapper to a different hole in the bar to see if that corrects the problem.
Flush the toilet again to see if the problem is solved.

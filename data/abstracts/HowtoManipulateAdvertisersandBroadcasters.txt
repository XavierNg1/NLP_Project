Choose a TV show or broadcast that irritates you.
Remember the history.
Find the solution.
Get on the web and research the mailing address, e-mail address or website of the advertiser.
Write them a letter with the following message.
Dear Sirs: Due to your participation as an advertiser on (this broadcast) I can no longer in good conscience patronize your company.
Note that if you want to really irritate the matter, call the local office of the advertiser if possible.
Apply this example to your personal situation.
Use caution to not rely solely on e-mail.
Remember one 'hilarious' historical note on using this approach to manipulate TV producers, broadcasters and advertisers includes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married%E2%80%A6_with_Children - the Terry Rakolta boycott where her media presence actually caused the ratings - and thus income - of "Married with Children" - to rise.
Remember the summary: TV is a money driven media.
Make TV what you want to be.

Don't give them any signs that you are desperately in love.
If you're interested in getting a date with this person, stay calm.
Get help from a trustworthy friend.
Act cool and collected around them.
Stay clean.
Before you try to talk to them, have a mental outline of what you're going to say.
When dealing with a person that has had a recent break-up, let them know that they have your support and that they can talk to you.
Don't act too confident!,
Don't stress out.

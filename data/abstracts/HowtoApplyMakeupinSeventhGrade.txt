Wash your face with water, and a facial cleanser.
Pat your face dry with a towel, or paper towel.
If you have any blemishes that you want to cover up, start with a concealer that matches your skin tone, not too light or too dark.
Take a translucent powder and apply it all over your face with a fluffy brush.
If you want, you can apply some blush to the apples of your cheeks lightly.
Take a white eye or cream shadow, and lightly apply under your eyebrow.
Use a light brown or pink toned eye shadow, and put it on the lid of your eyes.
Apply a dark brown eyeliner to just your upper waterline.
If your eyelashes are naturally dark, you can apply black mascara, but if you have blonde or light brown lashes, a dark brown mascara will look far better.
To finish this look, use a little lip gloss or tinted lip balm.

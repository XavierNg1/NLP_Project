Buy five to ten real roses and one fake rose.
Write the following words on a piece of paper: "I will love you until the last rose wilts..." Experiment with different fonts and colours for the best effect.
Arrange your flowers so that they are in a bunch with the fake rose in the middle.
Meet up with your Valentine in a quiet place that has some significance to both of you, such as a park or a quiet café/restaurant where you shared your first date.
Watch your Valentine's smile light up as you present them with their bunch of roses.

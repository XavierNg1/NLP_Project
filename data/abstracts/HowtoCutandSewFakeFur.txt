Pick your scissors.Lay the fake fur on a flat surface with the fur down and the backing up,
Have the scissors opened slightly, and slide the tip of the scissors into the fur so that you will only cut the backing, and not the fur itself.
Pin it first.
Push the fur away from the edges you will be sewing, and pin it so that the fur is kept away from the seam.
Keep the pins in until you are about to sew that section of fur.

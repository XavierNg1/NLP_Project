The dam will be more nervous and restless than initially in during the early labour stage.

,
As active labor comes about, the mare will be switching her tail, pacing more, pawing, or nosing at her flank.
The mare may be getting up and down once the contractions come faster and more intensively.
The water sac will appear first, amber-coloured.
The birth of the foal usually doesn't take long, often within 5 to 30 minutes after the last stage of early labor began and the water bag showed.
For large foals or hard birth,s you will need to pull the foal, if you can.

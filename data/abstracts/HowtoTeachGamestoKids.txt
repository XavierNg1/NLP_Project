Don’t worry too much about the rules.
Let the kids play with you in whatever way is most appropriate and interesting to them as a way to build focus and attention.
Appreciate the art, novelty, and fun of the game.
Try taking turns.
As you play and enjoy the game pieces, gradually introduce new concepts that will form the basis for the game rules.
Break down more complicated games into stuff your child recognizes.
When you think your child is ready and receptive, ask them if they want to learn a new way to play with the game.
Take out any complicated or confusing rules that you don’t feel your child is ready for.
Quit while you are still having fun.
Praise ideas and creativity and problem solving more than luck and winning.

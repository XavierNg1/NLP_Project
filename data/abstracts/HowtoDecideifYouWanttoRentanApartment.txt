Consider costs associated with renting and buying a home:The respective costs of renting a home or buying one are a primary concern when making a decision between the two.
Keep your income and credit in mind.In order to purchase a home with favorable mortgage terms (and in many cases, to purchase a home at all), you must have steady, reliable income, and a good credit score and history.
Decide how much home you can afford.Home prices and rent costs are determined in most cases by market demand; the amount you actually pay also depends upon factors like your credit score and the down payment you make.
Consider other factors.
Use a home rental/buying comparison calculator.
Determine how much you will pay in rent.To determine the overall costs of renting, multiply the monthly rent costs by the number of years you expect to live in the rented home.
Determine how much you will pay in mortgage costs.To determine the total mortgage costs, multiply the monthly mortgage payment by the number of years you expect to live in the home.
Calculate the net costs of renting and purchasing a home.The costs of renting a home are not limited to the rent payment itself, nor are the costs of owning a home limited to the mortgage payment.
Decide how likely you are to move.
Consider the work involved in maintaining a home.
Think about how emotionally important owning a home is to you (and your family, if applicable).
Make a pro and con list to come to a decision.Once you are armed with all of the information, calculations, and considerations related to buying and renting a home, you are ready to come to a decision.

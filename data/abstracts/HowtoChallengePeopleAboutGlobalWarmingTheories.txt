Explain that scientists have measured increasing temperatures and CO2 levels in several ways if skeptics argue that the only real evidence for global warming is CO2 in ice core samples where it's very cold.
Explain that human's recent contribution to the total levels of CO2 has offset the natural process and have caused the world to warm if skeptics argue that the total human-produced CO2 levels are small compared to natural sources.
Explain the importance of offsetting human contributions to the atmospheric CO2 levels as opposed to eliminating CO2 if skeptics argue that greenhouse gases are some of the most vital elements of this planet that keep it in order.
Explain that the wavelength at which solar radiation passes through the atmosphere is not same as the infrared radiation Earth radiates back into space if skeptics argue that the very notion of the greenhouse effect is flawed because UV rays from the sun penetrating the CO2 in the first place ought to be able to escape.
Explain that troposphere temperatures have been rising .22 to .4Â° F per decade since 1979 if skeptics argue that the troposphere, the area that would be the hottest if greenhouse gases were causing climate change, is relatively cool.

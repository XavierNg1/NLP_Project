Choose your deck shape based on your preferred type of riding.
Consider the board's concavity, or how much it curves.
Choose a wider board if you're a heavier skater and/or want to hit ramps and halfpipes.
Get a wider wheel base if you're tall, heavy, or want a wider turning radius.
Get a thicker board for more stability, or a thinner board for a lower weight.

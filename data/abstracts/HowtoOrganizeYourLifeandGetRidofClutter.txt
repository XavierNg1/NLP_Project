Take a day to completely clean your house.
Make charts for each family member and have them keep them in their room.
Now that the kids know their chores, let's focus on you.
Check the kids' chores around 7:00pm each night.
Motivate and try not to make cleaning something negative for your kids.
Be a good role model and stick to your MCP.
Work on the clutter.
While you are sorting your clutter and you find an object you would like to keep, go put it away right then!,
Don't be embarrassed that you are selling so much clutter, be proud that you are now clutter free!,
Stay organized and clutter free.

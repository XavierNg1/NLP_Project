If you really love your woman, go out and celebrate your marriage.
Say, "I love you honey!".
Trust her and win back her trust.
Do not cheat your partner.
Do not compare your wife with other women publicly.
Never take her for granted.
Welcome communications.
Understand that it is okay to be not perfect for you as well as your wife.
Quarrels, arguments, and qualms are part of every relationship.
Give respect to each other.
Remember all the celebration dates.

Decide you really want to stop this behaviour.
Make a list of all the reasons you want to stop the addictive behaviour.
Take your list and alter it so that every benefit of giving up your addiction is written in the POSITIVE, not the negative.
Take your new list and go to a nice quiet spot (without TVs or other people around).
In your peaceful place, take your list and begin to say, "Here I am in this wonderful place, and I am not smoking.
Continue with this practice all the way down your list.

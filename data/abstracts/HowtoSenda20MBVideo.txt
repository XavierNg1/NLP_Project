Determine the largest file size allowed by your email provider.
Determine the amount of storage available to your recipient.
Obtain a "file splitter" program, the best of which is HJSplit- completely free and very easy to use.
Using the file splitting program, break the large file into several smaller files.
Send the parts to the recipient as attachments to individual emails.
Once the recipient has received all of the parts, they need only use the file split program to reassemble the parts into the original file.

Make extra wide cupcakes using large cupcake papers or muffin pan holes.
Frost each cupcake.
Make the fingers.
Carefully slide a toothpick through the base of each finger in the center, about halfway up the finger.
Glue on the fingernails.
Using the base half of the toothpick, insert each finger into the cupcake soil.
Either leave things as they are, or pipe on a little red piping gel for added gore.

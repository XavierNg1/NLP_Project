Trim your eyebrows, then use a black or dark brown eyebrow pencil.
For eyeshadow, go for pastels OR metallics.

Apply a very light blush to your cheeks.
Keyshia loves lip gloss.
Keyshia usually has a curly hairstyle, so get your curling iron ready.
Apply a heat protectant spray or cream to your hair before curling, otherwise you might burn your hair.
Curl your hair away from your face, starting in the back.
Once you are done, apply a quarter-size amount of leave-in conditioner into your hand then begin to scrunch it into your hair.
To make the hairstyle last longer, spray in a light amount of hairspray.

Coat your silk screen with a thin layer of photo emulsion.
Let the emulsion dry in a dark space.
Set up an "exposure area" while waiting for the emulsion to dry.
Place your screen under the light in the exposure area.
Put your stencil backwards on the middle of the screen.
Turn on the light for the recommended time.
Blast off the emulsion with cold water.
Line up your screen above the object you're printing on.
Squeegee some ink over your design.
Slowly pull off your silk screen.
Repeat with as many shirts as you want, cleaning the screen occasionally.

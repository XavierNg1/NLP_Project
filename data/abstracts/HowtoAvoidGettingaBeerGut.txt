Assess your current physical appearance.
Adhere to a clean diet.
Consider eating your food “naked.” Sauces often contain a lot of sugar, sodium and additives your body does not need and yet they're a sneaky way to get more calories in unnoticed.
Eliminate sugar from your diet.
Curb the alcohol intake.
Devote at least 30 to 45 minutes to exercise five or six times per week.
Allow yourself a cheat day or meal once a week.
With a little bit of patience and discipline, your new goal will become your reality!

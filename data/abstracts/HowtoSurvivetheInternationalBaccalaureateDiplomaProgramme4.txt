Try not to freak out.
Remember, there is more to life than IB â€” lack of human contact due to IB can result in social isolation and depression.
Give yourself a break once in a while.
Avoid slacking off for any extended period.
Do not procrastinate.
Do the IB with friends, or make friends in the IB early on.

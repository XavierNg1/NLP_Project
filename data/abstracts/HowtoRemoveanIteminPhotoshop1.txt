Open and duplicate your image to prevent any permanent damage to the photo.
Use the Quick Selection Tool to select the item you want removed.
Use other, more precise selection tools if the object is too complex for Quick Selection.
Right-click on your selection and choose "Layer via Cut" to save a copy of the item you're removing.
Use a layer mask to temporarily erase items, allowing you to reinstate them later if you need.

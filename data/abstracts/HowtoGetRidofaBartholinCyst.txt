Have Sitz baths several times each day.One of the mainstays of treatment for Bartholin cysts are regular Sitz baths.
See your doctor if your Bartholin cyst does not resolve on its own.
Take medication to ease the pain.While you are waiting for your Bartholin cyst to be treated and/or to heal, you may wish to consider pain medications to ease any discomfort you are experiencing in the area.
Opt for surgical drainage.The most effective way to get rid of a persistent Bartholin cyst is via surgical drainage.
Take antibiotics.If your Bartholin cyst appears to be infected, your doctor will prescribe you antibiotics following surgical drainage.

Have your Bartholin gland completely removed.If you have a particularly bad cyst, or have had recurrent cysts, one of the "last resort" treatments is to have your Bartholin gland completely removed surgically, or removed via a laser procedure.
Note that there is no known way to prevent a Bartholin cyst.While many people have asked if there are strategies to prevent (or reduce the risk of) a Bartholin cyst developing in the first place, doctors say that there are no known strategies for prevention.
Continue with regular Sitz baths.After surgical drainage or a marsupialization procedure, it is key to continue with regular Sitz baths during the healing phase.
Refrain from sexual intercourse until your catheter is removed.You may have a catheter for four to six weeks to keep your Bartholin cyst open and to prevent further fluid accumulation, following surgical drainage.
Continue with pain medications as needed.You may use over-the-counter pain medications, such as Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or Acetaminophen (Tylenol) as needed.

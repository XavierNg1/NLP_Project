Consider using contraceptives that only contain progestin, as these are the preferred method for women who are breastfeeding.
Begin using progestin-only birth control around six to eight weeks after having your baby.
Beware of birth control that relies on the use of estrogen.
Use the morning after pill only as an absolute last resort.

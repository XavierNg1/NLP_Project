Gather treats that are not part of your gerbils natural diet.
Start by putting your fist in the cage.
Start feeding your gerbil.
When your gerbil is used to taking it from your hands, try holding it tighter and tighter each time.
When you come to a tight enough grip to where your gerbil is unable to take it, it will eat it from your hand.

,
When your Gerbil trusts you enough to eat from your hand, take it out of its cage and try.
Have fun trying different treats and seeing what ones your Gerbil likes and Dislikes.

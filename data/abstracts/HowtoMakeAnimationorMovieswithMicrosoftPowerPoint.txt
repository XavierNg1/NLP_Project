Open Powerpoint and create a new presentation.
Draw the first frame of your animation.
Duplicate the slide, and make a very slight change in this slide for the progress of the animation.
Do not duplicate the new slide and keep going.
Preview your presentation constantly, changing anything you think needs to be changed.
Add in sounds and other details, then make a beginning and ending slide, maybe even an opening sequence.

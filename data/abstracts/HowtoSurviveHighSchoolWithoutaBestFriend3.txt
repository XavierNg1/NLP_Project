Stay open to all types of friendships.Remember that not everyone has to be your best friend, and it can sometimes be good to have casual acquaintances that you can hang out with.
Send a casual invite to hang out with people.
Be brave, and reach out to possible friends.Sometimes, finding new friends can feel almost like dating, and be just as scary.

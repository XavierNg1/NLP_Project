When you dye your hair, get it professionally done.
Always lighten the eyebrows just a touch if you're going at least three shades redder than your usual color.
After dyeing your hair, do not wash it for two whole days.
When you do wash your hair, use color-safe, preferably sulfate free shampoo and conditioner, and wash it in cold water.
Use Aveda madder root color conditioner.
Stay away from the sun.
Use baby powder.
Always use thermal protectant when blow drying, straightening, or curling your hair.

Color depositing shampoos/glazes are great for refreshing color.

Always store valuables in a front pocket or a secret pocket.
Avoid walking through large crowds.
Touching or fiddling with the pocket where you carry your belongings tells the pickpocket where you carry your valuables.
Refrain from rummaging through your wallet or counting money in public.
Never hand money to panhandlers, unless you have loose change in your pocket.
Shorten the strap on any purse or bag you carry.
Pick up credit cards and other valuables as soon as the clerk returns them.
Whenever you are going out to a public place, only take what you need.
Use a money belt or an inside coat pocket.
Consider making a mugger's wallet if you know you will go somewhere dangerous.
Blend in.
Leave nothing unattended.
Wear backpacks on your front if you must wear one in a crowd.

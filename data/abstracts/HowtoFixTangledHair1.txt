Detangle your hair with a wide-toothed comb.Avoid using a regular brush on your tangles, since this can tear your hair and cause damage.
Use a soft bristled brush two to three times per day.If you have long or tangle-prone hair, you shouldnâ€™t go all day without brushing it at all.
Get a good detangling product.
Avoid all hair products containing alcohol.Alcohol is extremely drying to the hair.

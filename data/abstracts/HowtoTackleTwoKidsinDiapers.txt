Take things easily and work on one child at a time.
Let one child do whatever they need to do, while you tend to deal with the other's diaper issue.
Let sleeping children lay asleep, if only one of the two is asleep.
Deal with the youngest child first, in any situation.
Don't let one of the children get the attention of the other child, but it shouldn't be a completely surprise that this could happen however.
Let others help you change one of the two, if you are able to acquire another person who knows the process as well (or better) as you do.
Try to keep both children in disposable diapers (as opposed to cloth diapers) for as long as possible, to lessen the amount of work and money needing to be spent washing and laundering the diapers, along with taking much unneeded time loss out of your busy schedule by having to grab and remove diaper pins (versus an easy flick of a few tabs) and a few less folds (no folding required for disposable diapers).
Don't force your kids into learning a new diapered lifestyle, when potty training time is imminent, but let them know that you will be training them when you feel the time is right to start training them.
Follow suit for the second child.

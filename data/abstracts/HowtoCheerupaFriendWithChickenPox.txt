Call the person suffering chicken pox.
Pull together your supplies.
Even though people with chicken pox look hideous, refrain from commenting about it!,
Watch movies, talk, laugh and just keep your friend company.
Do whatever they want you to do, such as fluffing pillows, running an oatmeal bath for them, etc.

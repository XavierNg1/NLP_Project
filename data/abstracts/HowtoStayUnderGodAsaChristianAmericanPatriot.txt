Be sure that you are a Christian according to the Bible.
Love God; Respect God; Trust and obey God's law of love:
~ "Love you neighbor as yourself", and do good to all as much and in as many ways as possible.
Offer the vision of salvation, grace, hope, faith and love/charity and forgive and forget and be of higher service.
Do what is good for "the people of God," i.e.
Show devotion to the good of the people (to humanity not only to your state or nation)... also "providing charity, criticizing slavery, and denouncing excessive penal laws" has been considered patriotic.
Pray for the Government, those who have power over you -- and for the people to do well, to serve God and one another.
Help those in need and in danger.
Improve your higher purposes as a Christian.
Consider being involved for influencing the local, state and national government which may be (often) through public service, and consider what you may do to help "under God," in such concerns.
Identify for children unique features, such as exciting and fun facts of the place.
Remember that only you as the individual can make the nation a better one so you may want to be involved in your own ways, individually, in service with good vs. ill conceptions.

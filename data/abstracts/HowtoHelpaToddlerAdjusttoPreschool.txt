The first place to start is to examine your own feelings about preschool.
Take the time to visit the preschools in your area.
Let your child know the night before that he's going to preschool the next day.
Arrive early.
If it's your child's first time, ask to stay in the preschool room until your child is comfortable with you leaving.
When you feel your child is adjusting and is ready for you to leave her, discuss it with her ahead of time.
Once she's comfortable with her teachers and the preschool room, it will be easier for you to leave.
Greet your child happily at pickup time and give her a hug.
Be observant and flexible.
Be proud of your "big boy" or "big girl".

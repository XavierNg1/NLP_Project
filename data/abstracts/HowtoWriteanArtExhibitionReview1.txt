Of course it's a good idea to have a general idea of what kind of artwork and/or exhibition you are going to see before your initial visit, but before you do extensive background research, it is advisable to visit the exhibition without too many preconceived ideas.
Walk through the entire physical space to appreciate the exhibition as a whole, and get a sense of how it matches the curatorial goals.
Chronicle your viewing experience with notes.
Write a description of the exhibition (a visual inventory).

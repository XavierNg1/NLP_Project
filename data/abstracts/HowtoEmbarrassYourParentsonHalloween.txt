Dress up as something which isn't scary or even relevant to Halloween.
If you are a girl, dress as revealing as possible, but don't go over the top.
Imitate your parents.
Say inappropriate things for the occasion of Halloween and make completely unrelated comments.
Dress up as a beaten child and act like your parents are mean to you.
When trick-and-treaters come to your door, say "Happy Halloween!",
Act all lovey-dovey around them like hugging them and kissing them when lots of people are around.

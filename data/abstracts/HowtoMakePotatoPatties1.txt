Prepare the mashed potatoes.
Divide the mashed potatoes into eight Â½-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick patties.
Mix the flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow dish using a fork.
Dip the potato patties in the flour mixture.
Heat the oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the potato patties once the oil starts to smoke.
Lower the heat to medium-low, and cook the patties until they turn golden, about 15 to 20 minutes.
Serve the potato patties while they are still hot.

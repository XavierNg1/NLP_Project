If you are new at this, it's best to go on a day or night when the track is hosting a "street-legal drags" type of event, where all street-legal cars are welcome regardless of engine size, tire type, etc.
Ask your local dragstrip if they hold events to race your street-legal car just for fun.
Get your car ready to race.
Once at the track, pay, park and signup.
If you've never raced before, examine the layout you obtained and see where the staging lanes are.
Near the end of the staging lanes, watch other cars from your lane and see where they pull up to.
Now, pull up to the starting line and watch the "Christmas Tree" (display of lights at the beginning of the track, between the two lanes.),
Depending on the tree, either all three amber bulbs will light at once followed 0.4 seconds later by the green (this is called a Pro-Tree), or the three amber bulbs will flash consecutively 0.5 seconds apart followed by the green coming on 0.5 seconds after the last amber (this is called a Sportsman or Full tree.),
If the track is giving out time slips, there will be a shack on the return road where you can stop and your time will be given to you on a slip of paper.
You can go around to the staging lanes and race again, or park for a while and get some food/drink or watch others race.

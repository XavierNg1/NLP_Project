When your alarm goes off, get up.
At that time, get on your outfit that you will be wearing while competing if wanted (this can be done at the rink as well, but you may be a little pressed for time), and put your jacket on over it.
Arrive at least an hour and a half before your warm-up starts.
Make the most of any practice time you get.
Around thirty minutes before you go on, depending on what you need to do, start getting ready.
Before going on the ice, do what makes you feel best.

Play the original Pokémon Ruby and Pokémon Sapphire until you beat the game.
Compare the other legendary Pokémon that you want beside Groudon or Kyogre.

,
Think about the options.
Take the game itself into consideration.
If you got either Groudon or Kyogre in the original games, consider getting the opposite Pokémon so you have both.

,
Talk about it with other Pokémon fans.
Have a look at the exclusives of each game, and if your favorite Pokémon is exclusive to one game, then get that game.
Go with the one that appeals you most.
Decide on the spot.
Let fate decide.
Pokémon in general is really good!,
Remember, there isn't much difference between the two.
Do you want your main enemy to be Team Aqua or Team Magma?,
Did you have the original games?,
Or just choose between Blue (Alpha Sapphire) and Red (Omega Ruby)!

,
Bear in mind that the games will have different Pokémon.

,
Consider possible team set-ups and choices that you may want to experiment with.
Be tactical in your choice.

Observe your subject to start.
Position yourself with a sheet of 11 x 14" watercolor paper with the subject in view.
Draw the petals coming from the center of each flower and having small stems, 1/2" long, emerging from under the berries.
Begin to draw leafs.
Sketch in the vase or container.
Make your viewing vantage point be slightly above looking down at the flowers.Prepare your paints by squeezing from tubes, out two shades of red, yellow, two blues, two greens, and a light and dark brown.
Paint the berries yellow and when dry, mask them out.

,
Paint the red flowers by wetting each petal with water getting into all parts, including the tiny stem at the base.
Scratch with an open paper clip, a sharp piece of a credit card, or a stylus, the vein down the center of the petal.
Paint secondary layer of petals darker to have them recede slightly.
Paint the green leafs, varying them in hue and value.
Allow the piece to dry, set it away from you and look for holes in the composition.
Draw, using a ruler, draw a line just below mid point to separate the table from the background.
Finish up!

Begin with an end in mind (the "what").
Know why a particular product or service is important for your client and may be for your client's clients (the "why").
Know who are other key stakeholders in the project (the "who").
Take a deep breath - it's time for the "how".
Consider the "where" next.
Consider the "when" of your project.

To make your very own burn barrel, you first need a barrel.
One end of the barrel, which will become the top, must be open.
Once the top is open, turn the barrel upside down.
Using a piece of 'expanded metal', heavy screen, or something similar, make a cover to be placed over the barrel.
Some barrel makers like to add a few larger holes around the bottom to act as vents, supplying oxygen to the fire.
Place your 'burnables' in the barrel, use a long lighter or fireplace match to light, place the cover over the top, and let it burn.

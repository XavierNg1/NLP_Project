Hop in the water after you suit up with a life jacket and swim trunks.

,
Place the Air Chair into the water.
Slide your legs in through the seatbelt after you loosen it.
Move to the edge of the seat, for most people the Air Chair works best if your back is at the back edge of the seat, so you are sitting most of the way off the front of the seat.
Grab the rope and align it in front of the exposed part of the ski.
Steer with the rope!,
With the boat pulling you in a straight line, try to the keep the Air Chair straight.
Lean forward and keep the rope high to remain on the water.
Steering is the same as when in the water with one addition: leaning.
Attempt to raise the ski off the water.
Straighten your back (so you aren't leaning forward or backward), and keep your arms high (this keeps you on the water).
Practice the basics of controlling your height until you are able to go the full length of the post on command.
Jump by leaning back.

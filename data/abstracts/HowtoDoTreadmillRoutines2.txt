Put on appropriate exercise clothing and begin warming up on your treadmill.
Experiment with your treadmill to determine your fastest comfortable pace.
Set a speed that is 15 seconds faster than your last race speed or your comfortable pace.
Do 10 to 20 minutes at your comfortable running or walking pace.
Increase the period of time that you run at the higher speed by 1 minute every week for 10 weeks.

Choose what food you will can.
Start with something fairly simple if you've never canned before.
Choose food in good condition.
Consult a recipe and a current canning guide (see tips and sources) for the specific times and techniques for the foods you choose to can.
Wash your hands thoroughly and keep them clean throughout the process.
Prepare the food according to the recipe.
Make the canning liquid if your recipe calls for it.
Sterilize mason jars by boiling them in water for 10 minutes.
Boil about an inch (2.5cm) of water in the bottom of a medium saucepan.
Fill the jars.
Leave a little bit of space at the top, called "head space".
Add preservatives according to the recipe.
Pour the syrup or preserving liquid into the jar.
Remove air bubbles.
Wipe the rims and threads of the jars with a clean, damp cloth to remove any residue or drips.
Place a softened seal on each jar.
Screw a clean ring down over the seal and tighten it with snug hand pressure.
Use a water bath canner if your canning recipe calls for it.
If you use a large stock pot, place a rack or other spacer (such as a small towel) on the bottom of the pot so that the jars do not rest directly on the bottom of the pot.
Use a pressure canner if your recipe calls for it.
Remove the jars from the canner.
Allow the full jars to cool for 24 hours in a place free from drafts.
Check to make sure that the jars have sealed after several hours have passed.
Wash the jars in room-temperature, soapy water to remove any residue on the outsides.
Label your canned goods with the year, at least.

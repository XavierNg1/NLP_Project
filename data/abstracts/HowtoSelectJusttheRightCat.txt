Go to the pet store/neighbor's house, or wherever there is a litter of kittens that need adoption.
Ask the owner how they have been treated, and if they have any medical conditions.
Watch the cats or kittens play and interact with each other for a short time.
Ask when the kittens were born to see if they are old enough for adoption.
Find out whether the cat you're interested is one of a bonded pair.
Here comes the fun part: Naming your new kitty!,
If you don't have kitten supplies, or if it's still too young to take home, make arrangements concerning when you can come pick your kitten up.
Buy a collar and tag with your address, phone number, and your cat's name.
Take the kitten home, and introduce it to its new surroundings.
Enjoy your cat.

Walk for 10 to 15 minutes: pacing the halls, walk street blocks, or walk in-place.

Push-up on the wall for 2 or 3 minutes: Stand 2 feet (0.6Â m) from a wall, with feet at shoulder-width.
Squat-chair for 2 or 3 minutes: Choose a chair that forms 90-degree angle for your legs (calves to thighs) when seated (called knee bends).

Do the variations of the times, and the upgrades and change-ups, to keep it more interesting and to avoid plateauing.
Advance to pull-ups and/or push-ups, if you wish to go farther and harder...

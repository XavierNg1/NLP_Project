This applies to both rockets and sniper.
- If you catch rockets or sniper and stay still for 2 seconds, they will not be delayed.

,
- If you stand on the respawn of the weapon, look at the clock for 2 seconds after they hit the ground, they will not be delayed when you pick them up.

,
- If you catch the rockets or sniper and keep running, when you stand still for 2 seconds is exactly when the weapon respawn timer will begin again.

,
- If you have a sniper rifle (say, the 12:27 one) and "catch" the ammo from the 9:55 one that will not dirty it at all.

,
- If you dirty the weapon off of spawn, when you die is when the clock will start for the respawn of that weapon.

,
For example, say I catch the rockets off of spawn at 11:56 and run until 11:32 then stand still until 11:30, the rockets will respawn at 8:30 instead of the normal time.

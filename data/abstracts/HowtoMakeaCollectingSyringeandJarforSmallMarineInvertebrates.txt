Purchase a large disposable plastic syringe from a pharmacy.
Purchase a screw top plastic jar of suitable size to store the organisms until they can be decanted.

,
Cut open the end of the syringe.
Use the end of the syringe and a fine felt tip marker to mark the position for the hole in the lid of the jar.
Cut this hole using whatever tools you have that work best.
Pierce a pair of small holes adjacent to the loading hole for the bungee spring which will close the flap.
Pierce a few small holes in the far side of the lid to allow water to escape when transferring organisms from the syringe to the jar.
Cut a small piece of flat plastic sheet for the flap.
Thread a short length of thin (about 2mm) bungee cord (shock cord) through the holes in the lid and flap.
Test the function of the flap by fitting the lid to the jar and inserting the syringe through the transfer hole.

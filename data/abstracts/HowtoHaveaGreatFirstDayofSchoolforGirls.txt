Make sure you know your way around school before the first day if possible, like at an open house or orientation.
Lay out your clothes the night before.
Make sure everything is together.
You need to ditch those first day jitters.
Have supplies for your locker, like extra shelf inserts, a plastic mirror (so it won't shatter if it gets dropped), books, notebooks, and pencils.
If you are really girly, wanting to look great all the time, carry a small purse to class with you.
Make sure everything is ready.
Write everything in your mind down in a diary, or on notebook paper.
Get to sleep early, so you look and (most importantly!),
Wake up early!,
Then, brush your teeth well, get dressed, do your hair, do your makeup, make sure everything is together, eat a good breakfast, and look in the mirror.
At school, be confident.
Make sure your hair isn't greasy or dirty.
Meet your friends by the entrance, if possible.
Bags are important.
Get into the spirit!

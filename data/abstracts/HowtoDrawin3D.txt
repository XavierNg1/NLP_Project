Choose the object you would like to draw, sit in front of it or at an angle.
First draw the base of the object and work your way up.
Sketch the lines that will make up the pieces you can't completely see.
Sketch in the rest of the object's frame.
Trace over the outline in ink, and erase the pencil line after the ink has dried.

Beware of the Log Home Kit.
Keep in mind that a cabin kit itself makes up only a fraction of the total cost of your building.
Make sure your site is accessible by tractor trailer, if it is not you can unload at the nearest point accessible by the truck.
Don't assume that every kit that leaves the factory is done correctly.
Have the right equipment in place.
If you are putting a kit together by yourself you really need to have at least some carpentry experience, and it would help if you had some log building experience.

Select a healthy-looking plant with several buds yet to open.
Turn your plant around to determine its best angles.
Select your drawing materials.
Choose the size.
Start with a gesture drawing of the plant.
Plan the placement of the plant for your painting.
Prepare your surface for work: stretch an oil or acrylic canvas, choose your paper or board for any other media you prefer.
Transfer the drawing, once you're completely satisfied with it, onto the intended surface.
When your outlines are correct, do your painting or drawing of your subject, working from lightest areas to darkest areas, and protecting the paper by putting another large piece of clean tracing paper underneath your hand.
Work from light to dark, as mentioned before.
Finally, place the completed work in a mat - usually white or cream - and take another look at it.

Understand the risks.
Be very careful using a surrogate mother.Though natural hamster milk is the best source of nutrition for developing babies, hamsters are not very well-suited to surrogacy.
Replace the mother's milk as best as possible.
Use an eyedropper to feed them.Suck some Lactol up in the eyedropper, then squeeze it so a drip hovers on the end of the pipette.
Regulate the temperature for them.Hamsters are born furless, so until they're about 10 days old, they cannot regulate their own body temperature.

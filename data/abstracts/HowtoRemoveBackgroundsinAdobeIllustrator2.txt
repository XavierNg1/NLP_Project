Determine whether the Magic Wand tool will work for your image.Because the Magic Wand tool uses color or stroke (line width) to “magically” outline a selection with a single click, this method works best for images where the background sharply contrasts an object.
Double-click the Magic Wand tool in the left toolbar to launch the Magic Wand panel.The tool looks like a wand with sparks shooting from its top.
Select “Fill Color” if the object you wish to isolate is a solid color.
Select “Stroke Color” if the object you want to select is surrounded by a specific color line.
Enter a number in pixels (0-255 for RGB color, 0-100 for CMYK) in the “tolerance” box if you choose either “Fill Color” or “Stroke Color” as your parameter.
Select “Stroke Weight” to select lines of any color that are all the same weight.
Enter a number between 0-1000 (pixels) in the “tolerance” box if you choose “Stroke Weight” as your parameter.
Click the object on the image you want to keep.
Press the ⇧ Shift key and click the background.
Right-click (or Ctrl+click) the foreground image, then select “Make Clipping Mask”.This action will immediately delete the background, leaving only the foreground image and a white background.

Remove the background by making it transparent.
Save your image as a .EPS for use in page layout or design software.The .EPS format supports transparent backgrounds and is widely used in almost all graphic applications and word processing programs.
Save your image as a .GIF for the web.GIF files are known for their quick loading times and ability to support transparent backgrounds.

Begin with a regimented exercise program.
No hoof, no horse.
A long, lean neck is essential for a halter win, especially at higher levels.
Feed high-quality hay and grain.
Practice.
Find something to catch your horse’s attention that does not look crazy to the judge or spectators.
Body clip your horse about three weeks before the show, if you desire.
Two days before the show, bathe your horse.

Use warm water for the best cleaning.
Scrub in a moisturizing, high quality shampoo with a soft rubber currycomb.
Scrub any white areas with a whitening shampoo, and get them very white.

Shampoo the mane and tail with a shampoo meant for that purpose.
Apply a generous amount of conditioner to the tail, but only to the ends of the mane.
Apply a conditioner to the body hair and rinse out well.
Rinse out the mane and tail, very well.
When your horse is dry, clip his legs, bridle path, ears, muzzle & eye area.
When you arrive at a show, band your horse’s mane into 30-45 very thin ponytails.
Before your class, touch-up your clip job.
Run a damp cloth sprayed with a mixture of water and rubbing alcohol over every part of your horse to get the fine dust out, after brushing.

Apply a whitening agent to any white markings.
Spray his coat with a shining product once he is dry, and apply tail extensions.
Sand his hooves gently and apply a hoof polish.
Apply a highlighter to his muzzle, eyes, ears and bridle path.

Clean and adjust his halter.
Just before you enter the ring, apply another spray of shining spray and fly spray.

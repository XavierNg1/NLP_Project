Start with a small piece of cellotape (about 1 inch/2.5cm long).
Draw along the inner tape line if you are an intermediate expert.
If you are a beginner, you may find it easier to use the tape method to leave an open gap between the upper lash line and the lid.
Take off the tape when done.
Adjust as needed.

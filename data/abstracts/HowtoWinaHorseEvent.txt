Starch, iron and clean your show clothes.
Make your horse look like a star!,
Trailer to the event or show safely.
Check in.
Make sure you have enough time before your classes to tack up, change, warm up and relax a little.
Attach your number where is it straight and easy to read.
Have someone be your ‘ring crew’.
If you need to, take advantage of the warm-up ring, to get your horse's muscles stretched and warmed, and to work out any extra bucks your horse may have.

In a pleasure class, always walk in to the ring tracking to the left (your left shoulder should be on the inside).
In a pleasure class, if all the exhibitors enter at once, don’t enter in a clump with everyone.
For any class, take time to improve your position.
Remember to look forward and smile, no matter what your discipline!

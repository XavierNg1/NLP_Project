Start with the drumstick in your hand in French Grip, with the stick's center of gravity just above the index finger.
As you give the stick a small push over your index finger with your thumb, keep your index finger in the same place and bring all your other fingers away.
Let the stick fall over the index finger and place your middle finger on the stick.
Let your index finger push the stick over to rest between your middle finger and third finger so that the tip is facing upwards again.
Let the stick fall between your third and little finger.
Work the stick back up the opposite way to get back to the thumb.
Push the stick around and hold it in between your thumb and index finger again.

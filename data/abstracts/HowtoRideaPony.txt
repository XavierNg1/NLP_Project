Ensure your tack fits properly.
When mounting a pony you do not need a mounting block, but if you can, ask someone to hold the stirrup on the other side so you don't hurt your pony, or move the saddle.
Ride gently but firmly.
Expect shorter, faster action.
Make allowances for ponies while riding with horses.
Make sure that you don't pull to much on the reins or it will hurt and maybe scare your pony.

Bring the temperature up to about 500°F (260ºC) reasonably quickly.
Close the vent, bring temperature up to about 1500°F (815ºC) and fuse the glass.
Check after about five minutes to see if the glass is beginning to fuse.
Open the glass kiln lid or door once the glass has fused, and vent the kiln until the temperature drops to about 1000°F (538ºC).
Remove the pendant from the kiln when completely cool.

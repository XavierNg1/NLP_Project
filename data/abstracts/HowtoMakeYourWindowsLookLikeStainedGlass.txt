Draw or trace the design you want to have for your window.You can cover the entire window or just make a border.
Place clear plastic blank over the design.
Trace all the lines of the design with liquid leading.
Allow outline dry for at least 2 hours before adding color for best results.
Apply color around the interior of the outline first, making sure that the color touches the leading all the way around, then fill in the area inside.
Allow design to dry for a minimum of 8 hours.
Peel the design off the plastic starting around the outside edges and working inward.

,
Place design on a clean interior window surface.
Touch up any holes or tears carefully to avoid running and smearing, and if you wish, apply leading around the window edges.

Finished.

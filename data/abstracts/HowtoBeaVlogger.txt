Think of a topic to make vlogs about.
Get a YouTube account, and give your channel an attractive name.
Make about ten or more really good videos.
Post one of those videos to a related, well-known video as a video response.
Keep being active - nobody is going be interested if you don't post any videos for years also sometimes put your tittle of your video in CAPITALS to get people more interested.
Edit your videos!,
If you learn to edit, you can also set your banner, video thumbnail, and avatar.
Once you have a good reputation in the YouTube community, try to become a YouTube partner.
Communicate with your followers.

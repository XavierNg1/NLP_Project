Turn your NES upside down.
With the top half of the case off, remove the RF shield.
Remove the 8 screws holding the NES mainboard down and pull it out of the case.
Remove the 3 connectors for the controllers and switch assembly.
Remove the worn out 72 Pin cartridge connector from the mainboard.
The contacts connecting the 72 pin connector often get dirty and corroded which prevents the connector from making good electrical connection to the mainboard.
In the same way that you took off the old 72 Pin NES Connector, slide the new NES Connector 72 pin Nintendo Repair Part onto the now clean AND DRY Nintendo motherboard contacts.

Take basic safety precautions.
Mask any spots that you don't want to get dusty.
Try to mask along the existing panel lines.
Remove the paint around the rust with a dual action (DA) sander.
Switch to a metal grinding wheel.
Prepare the spot for priming.
Apply thin, even coats of primer.
Sand with 400 grit wet sandpaper.
Spray a thin coat of paint.
Buff the edges of the new paint so that it blends with the old paint.
Wash and polish the car.

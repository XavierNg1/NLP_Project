Stop thinking about writing songs, and start writing songs.
Listen actively to different types of music.
Get technical.
Learn the chords.
Be ready when inspiration comes calling.
Learn to write lyrics.
Figure out what you've got.
Set the mood.
Say something.
Make your words sing.
Strike a balance between repetition and variety.
Look for the hook.
Smooth the rough edges.
Get feedback.
Once you've finished your first song, don't stop.

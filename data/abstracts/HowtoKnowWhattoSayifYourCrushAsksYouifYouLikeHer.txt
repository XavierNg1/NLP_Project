Listen to the way she asks you if you have a crush on her.
Watch for how she looks at you.
Look out for her gestures and posture.
Pay attention to the signs that she doesn’t like you.
Hang out with her more before you decide that she does or doesn’t like you.
Stop and find a good place to have a conversation.
Tell her how you feel.
Ask her how she feels about you.
Give her an explanation of why you have feelings for her.
Take some space for your immediate reaction to pass.
Treat yourself like a friend.
Think about her perspective and feelings.
Go out with your friends.
Distance yourself from her.

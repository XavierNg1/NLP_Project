Ginny was considered to be very attractive as she became a teenager, but didn't cake on make up and use endless products on her hair.
She was known as a forceful, independent young woman who knew her own mind.
She was also very brave, tough, and thick skinned.
Just because you're a forceful, brave girl doesn't mean you're a moody brute.
Ginny was also an accomplished flier.
Okay, I'm not one for promoting her bad side, but let's face it, Ginny was a very good liar.
Ginny was an animal lover too.
Ginny wasn't a complete bookworm like Hermione, but she was a good student.

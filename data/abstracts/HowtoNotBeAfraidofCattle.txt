Understand that phobias are both common and usually easy to treat.Avoiding visiting a farm, getting close to cows, or giving yourself nightmares about them is not necessary as your anxiety can be cured.
Learn the behaviours and body language of this bovine species.
Envision being near cattle in a hierarchy of situations, numbered one to ten.Ten represents your worst fear, and one is the situation that makes you least anxious.
Pay a visit to a farm or ranch that has cattle you can start working with to rid this fear.
Relax and be calm.
Breathe.
Watch the cattle and their movements.
See if you can give them (the ones that are being nice to you!),
Try to pet one of the animals that have come up to you for a treat.
Walk away with the thought that you have made good progress with yourself.

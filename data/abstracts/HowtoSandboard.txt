Get a sandboard.
Choose sand dunes or sand hills that are open for recreation.
Try almost flat terrain and skating exercises if you're a beginner.
Practice on a small sand hill with very little drop.
On the small hill, try the following drill to improve your ability to board on your heels:


Strap both feet in.
Repeat the above exercise, but this time working your toes, rather than your heels:


After you have strapped yourself in, turn yourself around and put pressure on your toes, to stabilize yourself at the top of the hill.
Continue going down the hill, each time increasing your skill in different areas.
Practice the above steps till you are comfortable with your skills.

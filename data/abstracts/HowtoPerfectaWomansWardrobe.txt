Empty your wardrobe onto the largest unoccupied space you can access easily.
Separate your clothes into the following categories: Tops (dresses), Bottoms, Jumpers and Jackets, Underwear, Shoes, Other.
Tackle the tops - you should have the following:


Tank tops in white, black and colour.
Brace yourself for Bottoms:


A black or dark coloured suit - Should match each other, but not necessarily worn together at all times.
Rejoice for Jumpers and Jackets


Neutral-colored sweater - aka jumper
A cardigan in black and one in coloured - a very effective way to look feminine and jazz up an ordinary outfit.
Underwear warnings!,
Start on the Shoes (You're not, by any means limited to just these so don't worry!,
Obsess over the others:


A selection of scarves, wooly and silk, in a variety of colours for all sorts of occasions
Hair pieces - headbands, berets, flowers etc as well as your other hair pieces.
Done!

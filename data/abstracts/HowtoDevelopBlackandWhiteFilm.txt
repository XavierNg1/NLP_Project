The Developer - 1:3 Chemical to water mix.

Once the chemicals have been mixed and stored in the gallon jugs, you need to bring them to the correct temperature.
Pop open the film canister, remove the film and load it onto the film reel, and place the reel inside the developing tank.
Place the tools out in front of you, possibly on a desk.
Turn off the lights.
Spool the film onto the film reel.
Place the reel inside the developing tank, and screw the lid onto the tank.
Bring the developing tank to the sink where you have the chemical jugs floating in water.
With stopwatch in hand, pour the working developer into the hole in the top of the developing tank.
When the stopwatch has reached 10 seconds from the end of your time, start pouring the developer out of the top of the tank and into the sink drain.
For the stop bath you can use water at 20 degrees Celsius.
When the stopwatch has reached 1 minute and 20 seconds, start pouring the stop bath out.
Pour the fixer into tank until it is full.
Once the stopwatch has reached 6 minutes, pour the fixer out of the tank.
Pour the hypo-clearing agent into the tank (with the lid off).
While the film is in the hypo-clearing agent, start running some water and bring the running water to 20 degrees Celsius.
After the 10 minutes are up, lift the film reel out of the tank and lightly shake off any remaining water.
That's it!

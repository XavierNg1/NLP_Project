Get a snorkel and mask you feel comfortable with.
Put on the mask and tug the straps until it feels comfortably sealed around your eyes and nose.
Lay flat in the water on your stomach.
Bite gently down on the mouthpiece of the snorkel.
Take slow, regular breaths in and out through the tube.
Wear a buoyancy vest.

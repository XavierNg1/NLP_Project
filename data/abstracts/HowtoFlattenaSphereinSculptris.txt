Start up Sculptris with a sphere.
Click on the Grab icon.
Take the cursor and put it where you want it on your sphere.
Once it has the basic shape you want, shrink the size of the grab tool and manipulate the graphic using this tool.
Experiment with any other of the tools available to you to get it the way you want it.

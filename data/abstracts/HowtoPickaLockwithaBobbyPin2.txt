Insert your lever into the bottom half of the lock.
Turn the lock lightly in the direction you would use to open it.
Insert your pick, bent side up, and feel for the pins.
Find your first "seized," or difficult to move, pin and push it up until it clicks.
Find and repeat on the rest of the seized pins.
Adjust the tension on your lever if you're having difficulty.

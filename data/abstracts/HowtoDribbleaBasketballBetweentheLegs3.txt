Stand with ball in your dominant hand and your opposite leg a generous step in front of your other foot at a 45 degree angle to the rest of your body.
Push the side of the ball that corresponds to your dominant hand on the next upward bounce and direct it through your legs.
Be ready to receive the ball with your opposite hand after it has passed through your legs.
Switch your leg position by doing a hop step if you want to practice in a stationary position.
Repeat steps 1 through 3 with the opposite leg in front.

Hold the cable in one hand (as if it were a stick to be whittled), with the end to be stripped pointed away from your body.
Hold the razor knife in your dominant hand and extend the blade if not done so already.

,
Firmly press the edge of the blade (not the point) into the cable at a right angle (perpendicular to the cable) about an inch from the end.
Run the blade halfway around the cable by rotating the tool around the cable.Reposition the cable as needed in the other hand, so that the blade can easily continue to be rotated around the cable to continue the cut, while still being held in a comfortable position.
Return the blade to the storage position in the tool and put the tool down.Discard the cable end and pick up any stray wires from the "metallic shield" or braid.Cut off any braid wires that extend beyond the jacket so that they are flush with the jacket with the knife or wire cutters.
Carefully inspect the center conductor for nicks.
Remove any film or dielectric foam remaining from the length of the center conductor (if present) by gently scraping the center conductor with fingernail.
Hold the cable again as earlier to prepare for removal of the outer jacket.
Hold the razor as before, aligning the the blade on the jacket about 5⁄16 inch (0.8 cm) back from the cut made in the previous step.
Return the blade to the storage position in the tool and put the tool down.
Fold the braid back, over the outer jacket.
Inspect the cable end.
Place the "F" connector on the end of the cable.
The "F" connector is fully seated on the cable if the dielectric is flush with the "bottom" of the connector, when viewed from the end - looking in.
Secure the the "F" connector to the cable only with the tool designed for the connector.Inexpensive crimping type tool.Cut the center conductor so that it extends beyond the "F" connector 3⁄16 to 1⁄4 inch (0.5 to 0.6 cm).

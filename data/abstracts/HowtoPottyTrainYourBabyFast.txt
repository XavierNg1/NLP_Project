Throw out or hide the diapers, nappies, pull ups, or anything other than under wear.
Let your baby be free - Your baby can have on a t-shirt, but stay at home, and follow your little baby around fully in the buff.- You won't have to worry about pee and poop, if you follow them around after they eat or drink.
Try this for 2-3 days - I have four kids, and this method worked on every single one of them, they were all potty trained before two years old.

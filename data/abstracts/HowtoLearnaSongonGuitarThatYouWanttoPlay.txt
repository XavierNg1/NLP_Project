If you are a complete beginner, learn the basics of your instrument before trying to "cover" your favorite song.
Listen to the Song over and over.
Get the Tab or Sheet music for the Song.
Break the song down into small sections and tackle a section at a time.
This is VERY important: start out playing a section of music VERY SLOWLY.
When you get used to it, try playing along to a CD or tape.

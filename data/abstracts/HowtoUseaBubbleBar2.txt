Plan ahead.
Get out your reusable bubble bar.
Make sure your bathtub is clean, then start filling it with water.
Swish the "reusable" bubble bar around in the water.
Set the bar down on a towel to dry.Once it is dry, you can store it in its bag, or in a plastic box with a tight fitting lid.
Climb into the tub and relax.

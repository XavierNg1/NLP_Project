Create a Halo 3 game in The Forge using the map which you want to overload.
Enter editor mode once you have begun the Forge session, by pressing UP on the D-Pad.
"Before you do anything else go around and delete everything, spawn points, vehicles, weapons, and scenery.",
Press X on your Xbox 360 controller to bring up the items menus while still in editor mode.
Select equipment items on the mini-screen by pressing the Left or Right Bumper to shuffle between the item categories and choosing 'Equipment'.
Scroll down the equipment category and select the Trip Mine by pressing A on your controller.
Press X on your controller before you place the trip mine.
Set 'Respawn Rate' to 10 seconds by selecting this option and pressing A.
Press X again while still in the item property menu to open up the 'Budget Summary' menu for that item.
Save all the settings and exit the mini-screen and item menus by pressing B twice.
Place the trip mine in the map by pressing A on your controller.
Re-enter Player mode by pressing UP on the D-Pad.
Move over the trip mine to pick it up.
Throw the trip mine away from you and continue to throw each new one you pick up in a quick succession.
Wait for the trip mines to self-detonate (they should start to wobble and sparkle) or set them off by throwing a grenade into them.
Explore the map.

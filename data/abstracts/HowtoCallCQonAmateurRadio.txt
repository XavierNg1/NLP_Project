Look for a clear frequency by transmitting by asking "Is this frequency in use".
Start your call- CQ CQ CQ Calling CQ."CQ CQ CQ this is <your FCC call sign>"

,"CQ CQ CQ this is <your FCC call sign>"

,"CQ CQ CQ this is <your FCC call sign>"

If a station comes back to you but you are not sure of the his or her call sign, do not use the cw pro-sign of QRZ?

Wake up!,
Make your bed!,
Shower.
Brush your teeth before bed and in the mornings.
Eat a healthy but quick breakfast!,
Makeup.
Don't spend hours straightening your hair, or curling your hair and adding products.
Lay your clothes out before you go to bed, check the weather so you don't accidentally put on cool weather clothes on a hotter day.
Have your text books, bag and whatever else you need ready and in one place (by the door is best) so you can quickly grab them.

Go shopping for clothing.
Accessorize.
Get the hair.
Know your music.
Be happy with yourself.

Find the people who matter.
If you do want to participate in a social networking site, try bebo, facebook, or even vampire freaks.
Another important thing is to not be afraid to be random from time to time.

Locate the problem hose.
Assess how many components must be removed to facilitate replacing the damaged hose.
Determine if the hydraulic component the hose serves, or any other hydraulic components which must be removed have a live load, or weight on them.
Make sure any attachments which are supported by the hydraulic cylinder the hose operates are lowered to the ground or blocked or chained up.
Get the tools you will need to perform the job of removing the hose.
Remove all clamps and attachments which will interfere with removing the hose.
Loosen the fitting that attaches the hydraulic hose to the hydraulic system, either at a coupling, a cylinder, or the valve spool itself.
Pull the hose off of the equipment when both ends are unfastened.
Plug the fittings that remain on the machine to keep debris from getting into the system during the interval the fitting is open.
Wipe excess oil from the hose, and take it to an equipment supply store to have a new one ordered or made.
Clean all the fittings on the equipment before reinstalling the hose.
Plug the ends of your new hoses with a special cap or a clean rag before routing it through the equipment to where it goes.
Make sure the hose is in the correct location, and it has the proper amount of slack where needed when it is installed, then thread the fittings back on the cylinder or other component where they were removed.
Replace any clamps, guards, or other components which were removed to accomplish the task.
Check the fluid level in the machine, crank it up, and check for leaks.

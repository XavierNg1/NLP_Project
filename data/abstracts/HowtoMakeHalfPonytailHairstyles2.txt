Decide how large you want the bow to be.
Tie both sections together into a ponytail at the back of your head.
Divide the loop of hair in half, placing a finger into each loop and stretching the loop into two even sides.
Form the first bow side with the loose loop.
Repeat for the other side.
Use the remaining piece of hair in the ponytail to wrap around the elastic in the middle of the bow.

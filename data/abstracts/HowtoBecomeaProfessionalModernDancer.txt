Dance is silent poetry... contemporary dance is a fusion of poetry and freedom, but also a fusion of past and present.
Ballet is a first step.
And all these are "parallel" activities along the essence of our story.
Take good care of you.
Work with your body.
Eat well and hydrate your self.
Dance is art, and not gymnastics.
Your body is your canvas.

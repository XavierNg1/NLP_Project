Determine why you are ending the long term relationship.
Once you have made the decision, don't second guess yourself.
Recall the good times, and try to remember the friendship in a good light, if possible.
Don't call the person you have decided to stop being friends with, just slowly phase the individual out of your life.
Once the past friend calls you, you need to stay strong in your resolve to end the relationship.
If you see this friend out and about, just smile, but keep moving.
If you decide after several years that you want to try being friends with this person again, go ahead and give it a go.

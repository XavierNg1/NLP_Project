Make sure you have your horse saddled half an hour prior to your show jump round.
Keep an ear out on the load speaker, about 15 minutes prior to the start of your rounds, they will announce that the course is open for competitors to walk.
Make sure you are wearing the appropriate riding attire.
Start at the very start.
Walk to the first jump.
Continue to the second and subsequent obstacles.
Repeat the number of the obstacle as you approach, and at each jump, make sure you point and voice out the number of each jump.

,
Determine what jumps would cause the most difficulty, and work out the approach and get-away lines.

,
Make sure, that after you have walked the course once, you walk it again, unless your absolutely sure you know the pattern.
Warm up and then wait patiently for your go, allowing 2 riders prior to your round is good, that way, you can trace the course out, and see if a particular jump is causing difficulty, or if there is a bog forming where all the riders go causing the horse to baulk.

,
Wait for your number or name to be called, and approach the start line.
If you do forget the course, come back to trot and go the last jump you remember jumping, and continue jumping.

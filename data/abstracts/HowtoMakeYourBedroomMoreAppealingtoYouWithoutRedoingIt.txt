Before you even start, open the curtains and the windows and put on some music-but not your favourite, or you'll get distracted and start dancing!,
Tidy your room!,
Once your room is tidy, stand in the middle of the room and look around.
Now start to think of what you want to do with your room.
Once you are sure what you want to achieve, get to it!,
If you want to move any furniture around, take anything off the top of the furniture that's to be moved.
Then arrange everything on the surfaces of the furniture.Make the bed and if you have any cushions lying around, place them on the bed, next to the pillows, in a nice 'pile'

,
Take down any posters or pictures from the walls.
Sit back and enjoy your new space!

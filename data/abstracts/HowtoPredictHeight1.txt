Use the Gray Method for unborn children and children up to age four.
Measure the heights of the father and mother.
For a female child, reduce the father's height by one-thirteenth (12/13 of actual height).
Add the adjusted height of one parent to the non-adjusted height of the other.
Divide the sum by two to estimate the child's final height.
Put it all together.
Use simpler variations, if preferred.

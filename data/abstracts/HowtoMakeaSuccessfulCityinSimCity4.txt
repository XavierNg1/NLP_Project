Create a new region.
Choose what to build and develop first.
Place a road adjacent to it and drag it down to the bottom middle of your city.
Stop there and pause the simulation.
Make some money.
Go back to the power plant and take its funding down to one light bulb efficiency.
Create a small area of dense industry away from the neighborhood and near the power plant.
Expand your medium density neighborhood just a little.
Wait a bit and let things happen.
Now on the far side of your neighborhood, away from pollution and power plants, create a small low-density commercial center.
Wait until your population reaches 500 for this next step.
Build one or two water towers.
Have Smoke Detectors!,
Continue expanding slowly and maybe consider making your low-density commercial into a medium-commercial zone.
Stay patient.
Make some neighboring cities, start lowering taxes, and slowly expand.

Know what harmony is.
Form a chord with the melody.
Try the most basic chords (1-3-5) like "C-E-G." The 1 represents the 'root' note, then skip one up to note 3 that represents the 3rd (the note 2 places up from the first one).
Practice singing harmony, by trying harmony with a keyboard or a piano.
Sing along with a recorded song the way you're supposed to.
Try to sing a little bit higher or lower in pitch.
Realize this might sound awful when you first try it.
Harmonizing to a great degree is intuitive.

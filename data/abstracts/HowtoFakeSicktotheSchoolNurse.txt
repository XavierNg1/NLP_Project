Play the guessing game.
Plan in advance.
Mention feeling bad that morning or the night before to your parents.
Avoid suggesting they call your parents.
Fall asleep or at least fake it when you lay down.
When she "wakes" you up, tell her you still feel really sick.
Don't be too eager.
Slip in the, "Maybe you're right, I just can't concentrate.",
Keep it simple!,
Give them credit!,
Be more believable and instead of feigning vomiting, just say you started feeling bad.
Act sick until your mother or father picks you up.
Go straight to bed when you get home.
You could also make your eyes really red and say you think you have pink eye, or an eye infection.
One sure way is to say you threw up in a bathroom.
Before hand, you could say you feel really dizzy, and in class, take slow breaths.

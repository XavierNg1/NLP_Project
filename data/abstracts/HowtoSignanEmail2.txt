Consider the person to whom you are writing.
Save “Love,” “x,” or “xo” for those you truly love, such as family and spouses.
Use “Cheers” if you want to imply an informal, but fun tone.
Try “Many Thanks” if you are genuinely thanking the person for something.
Use “Be Well,” “Get Well” or “Thinking of You” when you are trying to refer to an illness or event.
Opt for “In Haste” if you haven’t had time to think too long on a subject.
Finish the sign-off with a comma and a signature.

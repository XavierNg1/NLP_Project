Use the following techniques to help to give you better odds, but recognize that sometimes you may still need more.
Twist the attacker's arm backwards (not enough to dislocate it), and hold it there.
Perform a headlock.
Some people that take karate classes have learned that to break out of a headlock, you need to step on their foot, giving them pain.

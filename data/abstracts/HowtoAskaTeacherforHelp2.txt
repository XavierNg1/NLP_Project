Ask to talk to the teacher in private.If you want to ask you teacher for help with a personal issue that you have, you should talk to the teacher alone, not during class time.
Tell your teacher what kind of help you need.
Be honest.It will be a lot easier for you to ask your teacher for help if you are truthful about what is going on.You wonâ€™t have to worry about keeping a lie straight, so you will feel more relaxed talking to your teacher.

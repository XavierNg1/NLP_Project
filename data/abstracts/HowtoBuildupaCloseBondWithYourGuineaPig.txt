Pick up your piggy.
You can also carry your piggy on your lap (when sitting!),
Relax, your pet can feel your tension and this will make him/her scared or stressed.
Piggies love quite soothing music (classical is best) in order to calm them down.
Brushing your pet may build up a bond and your local pet store will stock a small animal brush for sure.
Get some small treats or cut up veg to give your piggy.
Let them lick the sweat off your fingers.
If you are bringing a piggy home for the first time, give them about a week before handling.

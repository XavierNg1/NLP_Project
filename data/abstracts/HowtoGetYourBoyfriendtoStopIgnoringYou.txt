Consider whether you might have given your boyfriend cause to feel overwhelmed.
See things from his perspective.
Give things a bit of a break.
Don't let it get to your head.
Be up front.
Reach out to him on his level.
Make an effort to go out on a date.
Demand respect.
Give him a little bit of the cold shoulder.
If you feel like he's cheating on you, end it.

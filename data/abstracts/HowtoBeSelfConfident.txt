Be proud of your strengths.If you want to be self-confident, then the first thing you have to do is to think about all of the things you already have going for you.
Work to be an optimist.
Be prepared.
Stop comparing yourself to other people.
Get rid of as many sources of negativity as you can.
Embrace the unknown.If you have trouble with self-confidence, then doing something completely new and different probably doesn't exactly excite you.
Take more risks.
Spend time with people who make you feel good about yourself.
Cultivate a hobby.
Show confidence in your body language.
Put time into your appearance.
Learn from failure.People who are self-confident are not a wild success at everything they try.
Exercise more.Though exercise alone won't make you feel like a million dollars, getting in the habit of exercising for at least 30 minutes daily, or just a few times a week, can go a long way in making you feel both mentally and physically better about yourself.
Smile more.
Don't be afraid to ask for help.Being self-confident doesn't mean you have to be a jack-of-all trades who is amazing at every little thing he does.
Learn to live in the present.If you lack self-confidence, you may find yourself dwelling on actions of the past or worrying about the outcomes of future actions.

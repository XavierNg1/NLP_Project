First you should have two demo CDs, one with 2-4 songs and one 3-10 songs.
Next, find some US-based artist (singers, rappers, composers, etc.),
When you have found a few search for them (preferably on Google) and find the label they are signed with.

,
After you have found that, send ONE CD to the label.
This is the worst part.

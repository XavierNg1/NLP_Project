Have a good appearance.
Find a cute guy, and then figure out a way to be introduced to him.
Talk to him.
Start doing things with him.
Do NOT seem all over him.
After you've become acquaintances with him, it should be clear if he is into you or not.
After this, he should start making moves on you, or you two will be comfortable enough to move forward together.

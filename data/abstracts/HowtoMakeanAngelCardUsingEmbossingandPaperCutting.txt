Choose the colours you want to use.
Make guidelines on the back side of the front cover.
Stick the embossing pattern with scotch tape along the guiding lines.
Take an embossing needle (as you can see in the picture here) and start outlining the pattern on the front cover, much like moving a pen around on a stencil.
Outline the inner pattern after you're through with the outer pattern.
Keeping the edge of the embossed pattern in mind, cut the bronze (or whichever colour you want) paper ribbon and paste it as shown.
Paste the second mold on the “outside” of the front cover (it's a positive embossing pattern).
Start embossing with the needle on the reverse side.
Paste a bronze colour paper at the back to give it a matched look.

,
Use the same bronze colour paper, cut out flowers and paste them as shown.
Paste a white flower of a smaller size on top of the bronze flower.
Finished.

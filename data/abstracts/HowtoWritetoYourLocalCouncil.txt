Research how to write to your local Councillor or MP.
Write your preferred choice of communication, whether that's a letter, e-mail, fax, or in person if you happen to see your MP down the street buying an ice-cream.
Remember your English skills when writing your letter!,
Don't worry if they don't reply straight away.
Ask others about the issue too.

Decide which decrease to use.
K2tog or knit two together: This is one of the simplest decreases.
P2tog or purl two together: This is the same as k2tog, except you will pick up two stitches as if you are purling one and purl them to create a left slanting decrease.








,
KRPR or knit return pass return: Knit one stitch and then slip it back onto the left needle.
SSK or slip slip knit: This uses a similar technique to k2tog.
SSP or slip slip purl: Slip two stitches knitwise and then slip them back onto the left needle.
SKP, sl1, k1, or psso: Slip one stitch purlwise, purl one stitch and then slip the second stitch on your right needle over the first stitch to make a right slanting decrease.








,
YO or yarnover decreases: Slip the yarn over as if you are going to do a YO.
Pay attention to whether your are decreasing on a purl stitch or a knit stitch.

Going online and looking for the right plan can be frustrating and sometimes overwhelming if you are looking for one that includes instructions and a list of materials.
Think about how large you want your shed to be and what you will store in it.
Consider whether your blueprints should also contain information about insulating the shed or providing additional storage solutions (like shelves or attic space).
Take a look through and see if the instructions are clear and if they list what materials and tools you will need.
Consider whether you want to tackle this in a few days or in a week.
You also need to consider if you want anything else done with this shed.

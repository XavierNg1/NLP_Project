Talk with your child in "their own language", if the child is able to understand what you mean when you speak.
Purchase and install a blanket sleeper zipper-flap onto the garment.
Require your kids to use completely-fingerless mittens whenever they wear this type of garment.
Cut away cleanly and reverse the feet directions to the sleepers you keep finding your child unzipping.
Purchase a sleeper with a zipper in the back.
Find and use a sleeper that doesn't use a zipper.
Try not to change your children into garments that are associated with slightly-warmer temperatures than what is to be expected for that night (unless you plan on making it mandatory to swaddle them in heavier-weighted blankets-no matter what their age might be).
Remove the blanket sleeper entirely, and instead, swaddle the infant in several layers of bigger-sized blankets.

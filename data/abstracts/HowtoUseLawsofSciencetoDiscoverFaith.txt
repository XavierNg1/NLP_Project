Consider that our universe is so orderly as to be based on fixed laws.
Record data as scientists do with what they observe.
Observe that there is no logical necessity for the universe to obey fixed rules, let alone abide by the rules of mathematics.
Imagine an unpredictable universe in which conditions change from instant to instant, or even a universe in which things "pop in and out" of existence.

Consider such discoveries as Kepler's third law stating that the square of the time of a planet's revolution is proportional to the cube of its mean distance from the sun.
Research Newton and find what he thought:~ "Newton and many of his contemporaries believed that in doing science they were uncovering the divine plan for the universe in the form of its underlying mathematical order.",
Examine a list of some leading Christian scientists whose work was in the frame of their faith, e.g. Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Brahe, Descartes, Boyle, Newton, Leibniz, Gassendi, Pascal, Mersenne, Cuvier, Harvey, Dalton, Faraday, Herschel, Joule, Lyell, Lavoisier, Priestley, Kelvin, Ohm, Ampere, Steno, Pasteur, Maxwell, Planck, Mendel.

Remember that you are strong.
Don't think about memories you had with your ex/friend.
Think about how long you have known them.
Think about what went wrong.
Find out if this person is missing you as much as you are missing them.
Remember that you guys did not only have good times in the relationship.
Don't say you ended it, thinking it was good and you regret it.
Do things that take your mind off of the relationship.
Do a hobby of yours.

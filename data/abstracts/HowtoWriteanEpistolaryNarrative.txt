Learn the basic structure of a narrative.Before you can write your epistolary narrative, you need a story to tell.
Provide background information in the exposition.As your story begins, you need to establish three things: main characters, setting, and mood.
Present the protagonist with conflict during the rising action.
Bring the conflict to a head at the climax.This should occur close to the end of your story, after the tension from all your conflicts has built up over time.
Release the tension in the resolution.
Include a denouement.Some stories include a section in the falling action that ties up loose ends.
Decide how much of the story will be told through letters.
Figure out who will be speaking in the letters.You can limit the point of view to a single character, as Stephen Chobsky does in The Perks of Being a Wallflower.
Determine whom the letters will be addressed to.Again, there is no single strategy for writing these letters.
Use the letters to deepen characters and relationships.
Leave gaps in the chronology for realism.Life gets in the way, even for the most dedicated of writers.
Choose how to format your letters.
Create an outline.Before you begin writing your actual story, make an outline of major events so you know how the plot will progress.
Write your first draft.
Don’t get frustrated.Writing a story is hard — really hard!,
Work your way through writer’s block.
Revise for as long as you need to.The real work of writing comes in the revision process.
Be your own toughest critic.It’s easy to fall in love with your baby.

Never give in to teasing.
If you're geek, nerd, goth, emo, punk, scene, or indie (etc.
Don't say too much about the teasers' looks to them.

Remember, don't read Cosmopolitan, Vogue, or Harper's Bazaar.
You may be chubby and you're getting harassed.
Be funny and mean but not overly.
When you tell, elaborate but don't get too detailed.
Never, ever be sarcastic.
Try to say things, such as (bully calls you fat) "Well, you see me as fat, but I don't so maybe I should ask you what is slim?,
Look tough.

Stand tall and straight, with your hands at your sides; give a serious, slightly lopsided-mouth expression and look people in the eye: confidence is the key.
Fight the person who teased you.
Only give up when you've defeated the bully.

Thanks!

Identify your skin type.Itâ€™s important to buy products that match your skin type.
Select gentle products.Avoid products with harsh chemicals and added fragrances.
Consider using an AHA or retinoid product.Alpha hydroxyl acids (AHAs) and retinoids can reduce the signs of aging on your skin by encouraging rapid cell turnover.Both can be mildly irritating to the skin, so start out slowly.
Exfoliate gently once per week.Exfoliant products help whisk away dry patches and scaly skin, which tend to emphasize the look of wrinkles and pores.

Decide that you really want to stop being "that person who's always late" and that you really want to improve the social/economic aspects of your life that suffer from your inability to be early.
Decide how early you would like to be, normally 5 minutes is a good time for when you have a good habit at being early.
Get your alarm clock and put it in the position where you will look often while getting ready to leave.
Set this clock 10-15 minutes ahead of the actual time.
If you have children or other people who depend on you in the morning this is where you have to bring your best attitude.
When you know you have to be someplace on time, imagine quickly what you have to do to get ready for this place.
Start getting ready with extra time in advance.
Go to your place that you have kept the things you need to take with you grab them and go.
Write down on a piece of paper or pad each place that you have to be on time.

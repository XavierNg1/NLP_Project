Perfect your starting stance.The ideal starting stance is a combination of good balance, keeping your shoulders relaxed and squaring your body off to the plate.
Practice sustaining good balance during the leg lift.Make sure to lift with your knee and avoid swinging your foot up during the leg lift.
Avoid "tucking" your glove.The extra movement produced when you tuck your glove will lead to an inconsistent throw.
Release the ball correctly.
Perfect your follow-through.After you release the ball, bring your weight down onto your braced lead leg and make sure your throwing shoulder comes down over the lead leg.
Record yourself pitching.

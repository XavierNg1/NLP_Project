Know your cacti.
The idea is to avoid getting pricked with them in the first place.
Have ready the pot you want to put your cactus into.
Slide the plant out.
Safety first!,
Cradling the pot in one hand and the cactus in the other hand (gloved or not) gently turn the pot on its side to see if the plant is loose.
Determine if it is pot-bound.
Now turn the pot on its side on a surface and holding the pot steady with one hand, insert the bamboo rod or wooden dowel into the drainage hole and gently push against the potting medium or the rock that was placed there.
If all else fails you can try tapping the pot lightly on a surface, rotating the plant as you do.
Once your cactus is free of its pot, pull away any old gravel and screening.
Estimate how much soil you will need to place in the new pot to elevate the plant to the correct height and place the amount needed into the new pot.
Make sure not to bury any part of the cacti that was not buried before when repotting as this can encourage rot.
Once your cactus is potted you can pull off the newspaper or cloth.
Know your options if the plant is too darn big.

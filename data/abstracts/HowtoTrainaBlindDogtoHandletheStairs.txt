Remember that blind dogs already have a bit nervous and frightened perspective on the world.
Remember that your dog is blind.
Sit at the bottom of the stairs.
Make sure you are sitting on the first step of the stairs.
Pull him up a little bit more, so that he is completely on the stairs.
Wave the treat in front of your dog's nose and make sure he has smelt it.
Repeat this step over the next few steps on the stairs.
Urge your dog to go up 2-3 steps at a time, then 4.
Take his leash off and go up the steps just as you did before.
Go to the big step after doing this a few times.
Do this a lot to make sure he keeps the knowledge that the stairs are safe and fine.

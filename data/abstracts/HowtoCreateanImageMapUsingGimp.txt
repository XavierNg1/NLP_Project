Put together an initial graphic that you will be mapping.
After creating the image, (or opening it), go to Filters >> Web >> ImageMap.
Click on the rectangle at the right of the screen, then select one of the images that you want to use.
Continue this process for the rest of your map.

,
Once you have finished defining all the link areas, save your image map.
IF you haven't saved it as an HTML file, find your saved file and rename the extension to .html.
Use a text editor to open this HTML file.
Ensure the file path defined in <img src> links to the image you want the URLs mapped onto.
OPTIONAL: Use a browser to open your HTML file; if everything works, you should see the image with all the URLs mapped onto it according to the areas you defined.

Add your image map into your web page HTML.

Buy golf clubs online as it can be a great way to expand the choices you have and save a lot of money versus buying golf clubs at a high end pro shop.
Know the type of clubs that you are looking for.
Investigate the website you are looking to buy from.
There are also many sites out there selling knockoffs or clones of the major name brands.

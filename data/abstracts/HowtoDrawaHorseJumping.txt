Get familiar with the horse anatomy, and the gaits of a horse.
Have a high quality image or model of a horse jumping at the desired angle, either launching or landing.
Determine how high the obstacle the horse is jumping is.
Start with the body of the horse.
Finish at least the body above the legs, in both the front and back.
Note that if the horse is launching or has just done so, its front legs will be curled under its body, while its hind legs are extended, on the ground or not.
Sketch circles where the knees, ankles and hooves will be, in all four legs.
Draw in the correct leg shapes using your image or model, either folded or extended.
Move up to the neck/head.
Complete the regular shapes needed for a neck and the head.
Finish the entire body.
Add all the detail of muscle you might have missed, and shading if desired, before comparing to your image.

Prepare your room for sleep.
Sit somewhere comfortable.
Think back to a time when you did feel very tired.
Imagine that you're sitting somewhere and you are with friends.
Imagine how you're feeling as the yawning happens around you.
If your eyes want to close, let them.
Keep yawning.
Allow yourself to drift.
Head for bed.

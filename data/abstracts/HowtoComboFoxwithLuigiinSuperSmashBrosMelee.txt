Look at their location.
When they're about to start their recovery move, grab the ledge.
If you (Luigi) are below 100%, do a normal ledge stand right as they begin to move from their up-b.
If Fox is right at or slightly above or below the level of the ledge, grab the ledge, then release it, double jump, and Bair or Uair.If they do a high angle to avoid these options, use the time after the ledge hop to grab ledge again, do a ledge dash, and hit them back off.
If the Fox is further below the stage, just hold the ledge.

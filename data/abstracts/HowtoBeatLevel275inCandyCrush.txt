Clear as many jellies as possible from the center of the board before clearing the jellies and meringues blocking the bomb dispensers.
Save the three jelly fish at the bottom of the level for your last moves to clear the meringues and jellies blocking the two bomb dispensers.
Avoid matching special candies that will prematurely break the meringues blocking the bomb dispensers.
Try to move any vertical striped candies you create into the columns on both sides of the playing board adjacent to the chocolate columns.
Allow chocolate to spread and cover the bomb dispenser until youâ€™re ready to clear all chocolate covering jellies near the end of the level.

Start in an alleyway, and you will see a bike with a Blue Diamond over it.
Watch for a message.
Wait for another message to pop up once you get closer to the "CJ" icon.
Look for a sign saying "Press up or down to shift your weight on the bike".
Check to see if you are now standing in front of your house, the one with the red marker, you can complete the beginning by simply walking in the red marker, or you can bike around a little more for the sake of fun.

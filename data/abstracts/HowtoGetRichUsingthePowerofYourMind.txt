Know what you desire: It is the first thing you should be aware of.
Have a Clarity of Vision: Write down all the things you desire.
Read aloud everyday at least twice (When you wake up and when you retire).
Show Gratitude.
Take the first step.
Anchor the things into your life.
Getting what you want is not just about stuff, its about new behaviours, breaking old behaviours, changing your lifestyle.. You must vividly attach it to other things that make yourself want to .. not just wish too.

Celebrate.

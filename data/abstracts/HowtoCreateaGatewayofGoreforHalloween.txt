Think about what kind of effect you are trying to achieve.
Measure the outer frame of the entrance-way you plan to create your "Gateway of Gore" around.
Use your measurements to mark pieces of plywood to the lengths needed to fit around the entrance-way.
Use a circular saw to cut the wood to the lengths you need.

,
Determine a shape you wish the outer edges of your gateway to be.

,
Draw a line on the wood that defines the planned outer edge.
Utilize a jigsaw to cut the edge design that you have planned.

,
Layout your cut pieces of wood and make sure that everything is matching up nicely.
At this point, you have the option of using masks to decorate your gateway.
Use the spray foam insulation.
At this point, if you have utilized masks as part of your design, you will want to inject some foam spray inside them to give them more shape and keep them from crushing down.
Allow the insulation to dry for a few hours.
Paint the foam with oil paint.
Store the gateway somewhere safe.
After the oil paint has dried, you can use spray paints to accent and highlight your design.
Allow the spray paint time to dry.

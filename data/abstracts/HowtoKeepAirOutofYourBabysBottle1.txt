Prepare the formula or milk in advance.
Avoid pouring the milk from high above the bottle.
Avoid shaking the bottle.
Allow the bottle time to stand before you give in to your baby.
Consider using drops that will reduce the amount of air bubbles that form in your formula.
Use bottles that can only contain enough milk for one whole feeding.

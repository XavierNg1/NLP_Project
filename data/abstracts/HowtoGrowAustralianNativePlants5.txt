If you have soil that is too heavy to grow plants like Boronias then buy a large plastic pot, cut the bottom out of it place this on the ground (loosen the soil first) then fill the pot with potting mix and plant your plant.
Apart from planting native plants, you will also be creating a habit style garden where native plants will play a part of the food chain for any animals and insects etc.

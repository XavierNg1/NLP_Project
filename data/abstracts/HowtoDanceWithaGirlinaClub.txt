Strike up a conversation with a woman at the bar or edge of the dance floor.
Head down to the dance floor to see if anyone wants a partner.
Make eye contact and smile to see if she wants to dance.
Don't spend your whole night searching for women.
Keep your movements simple and low-key.
Learn the two-step to get through any song at any club.
Bump and grind if a woman moves in closely, so that your hips are touching or close by.
Bounce to the beat if you're lost or unsure what to do.
Mix and match simple movements together to appear like an amazing dancer.
Pay attention to the drum beat to dance with rhythm.
Let the "leader" of the dance come out organically.
Let her initiate any increase in touching.
Focus your attention on her, not other women.
Mix up your moves as you get more comfortable.
Don't look at dancing as a competition or "test" you need to win.

Really think over your situation with this person.
Having low self-esteem can make a player seem like the dream guy.
Learn to love yourself and divert all this attention from him to yourself.
If need be seek therapy.
Ask yourself why you would even want to get involved with a selfish player, who sleeps around and is just going to use you as a vessel for his sexual needs.
Don't take his actions personally!,
Don't call him - ever.
Learn to love yourself a little more each and every day.

Determine repair parts needed: All moving parts are subject to failure and you may need to remove the serpentine belt to replace the belt itself or one of the components it drives.
Park the vehicle in a level spot and set the emergency brake.
Raise the hood of the vehicle's engine compartment and set the hood brace to keep it open, if so equipped.

,
Engine caution: Remove the negative battery cable connector from the battery terminal to be sure that no one will be able to actuate the engine or starter.

,
Look for a diagram decal posted near the front of the engine compartment that lays out the serpentine belt.
Locate the serpentine belt auto tensioner pulley using the diagram.
After letting the engine cool thoroughly, use one of the tools mentioned below to pivot the tensioner pulley to take the tension off the belt.
Serious damage caution.
Caution against injury: Be careful to neither let the tool slip nor release the tool handle suddenly or it could sling the tool, and damage the auto or possibly cause serious injury.

,
Push or pull, logically: You may push down on the tool handle -- if the belt is over the tensioner pulley -- or pull up, if the belt passes under the tension pulley (but not necessarily, as that direction depends on the design and orientation of the tensioner and the belt).
Hold the tension from the belt, and slip the belt off the auto tensioner pulley to remove the belt and pulley system.

,
Slowly release the tension to avoid damage or injury, and then remove the tool from the belt auto tensioner.

,
Carefully examine the pattern as you remove the belt from the remaining pulleys, to be sure that you understand the routing of the belt for replacing it later in reverse sequence.

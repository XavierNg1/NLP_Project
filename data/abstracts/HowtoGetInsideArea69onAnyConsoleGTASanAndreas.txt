First, type in the cheat code for No Cops, so when you go into the base, they won't kill you.
Make your way to Fort Carson.
Get the bike and go on the road past the Lil Probe Inn and towards the base.
Go on this dirt road until you reach the fence at the base.
Go towards the other side, and at the south-east corner is a small mount with a vent on top.
Once inside, enjoy the labs!

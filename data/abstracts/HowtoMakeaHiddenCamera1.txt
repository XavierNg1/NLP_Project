Obtain a cheap webcam.
Remove the outer shell of the webcam.
Pick your hiding spot.
Mount the camera inside the object.
Tape or glue fishing weights inside the shell to keep the object from seeming unusually light.
Thread the USB cord (the cable that connects the webcam to the computer) through the back of the hiding spot.
If you hide your camera inside an appliance, consider taping up an "Out of Order" sign so that no-one tries to use it.
Point your camera toward the scene of the crime.

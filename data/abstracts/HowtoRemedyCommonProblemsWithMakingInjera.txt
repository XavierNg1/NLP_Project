If you cannot find teff (the main ingredient in injera), consider substituting barley or millet.
If you cannot find a sourdough starter, either order one online, or make one yourself.
If you don't have a mitad, use a plain old frying pan.
Fix a mess of an injera.
If the injera rips as you take it off, or wrinkles and turns into a blob of gunky mess, this probably has a lot to do with your still-burgeoning expertise at removing the injera.
If your injera is burned on the bottom, but still gummy on top, this probably means that you have the pan too hot.
If your injera aren't stretchy or absolutely won't come off the pan in one piece.
If your injera has no bubbles, this suggests that kneading the dough affects the bubble content, and the baking powder has a lot to do with it.
If your injera tastes funny.
If your injera has deep grooves, tears, or cracks in it, this might be because you're using a wholewheat flour.
If your injera is a complete disaster, turn it into something else and hide it.

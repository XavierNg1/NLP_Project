Plan how wide you want your ring to be, and mark it with a Sharpie or other marker.
Place pipe segment on table or another edge, and using a hacksaw, cut vertically down your mark.
Take a sheet of #150 grit sandpaper and place on a table or other flat surface, rough side up.
Sand until desired thickness.
Once the side is smoothed, hold the #150 grit sandpaper and ring in your hands.
Once you have the ring in the desired size and shape, take the #220 or finer sandpaper and gently sand the entire ring, so it is very smooth.

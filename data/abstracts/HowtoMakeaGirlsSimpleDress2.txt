Gather your supplies.
Find a suitable tank top and pillowcase.
Make a mark on the tank top where you want the skirt to begin.
Cut straight across the tank top, ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) below the mark you made.
Cut the top seam off of the pillowcase so that you have an opening at both ends.
Sew two straight rows around the top edge of the pillowcase.
Turn the pillowcase inside out and tuck the tank top inside.
Align the tank top with the pillowcase.
Start gathering the pillowcase until it fits the tank top.
Pin the pillowcase to the tank top.
Sew the pillowcase and tank top together using a ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) seam allowance.
Finish off the waist seam.
Turn the dress inside out.
Check for any loose threads.

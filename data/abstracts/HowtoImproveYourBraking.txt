Start by finding an appropriate level open space to practice in.
Place two rocks, cones, or water bottles 4 feet (1.2Â m) apart near one end of the area.
Ride towards the line at a running pace.
Switch to using only your rear brake.
Switch to using only your front brake.
Resume using both brakes simultaneously.
Pump your arms downwards quickly and with force just as you start to apply your brakes.
Pump with your legs into the pedals to increase force on the rear wheel.

Keeping your pedals level, drop your heels so your feet point up 30 degrees while braking.
Compare your stopping distance and control while braking to when you started, you should now be able to stop in a much shorter distance.

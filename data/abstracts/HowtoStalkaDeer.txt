Wear the right camouflage or else the deer will spot you and run away.
Relax.
Find a deer track.
After following the track for a while to see which direction it is going, check the map to see where the direction will take you.
Once you know that there isn’t anything that will get in your way, start heading in the direction of the deer.

,
Look out for coyotes or wolves, because you’ll be hunting during deer mating season and they are vulnerable to coyote and wolf attacks.
Pay attention to the trees and the bushes because the deer may have stopped to eat or defecate; by looking at the faeces and checking its temperature, you can tell how long ago the deer was there.

,
If you find a sign that can tell you that the deer was there within half an hour, you may be extremely close to the deer and may spook it.

,
Once you think you are close to the deer, stop and make a deer call for a minute or two.

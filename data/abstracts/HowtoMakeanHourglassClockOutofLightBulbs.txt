Gather the tools that you need in order to get started.
Get started with a light bulb.
Start by hollowing out the inside of the light bulb.
Use needle-nose pliers to remove the metal tip from the bottom of the light bulb.
Hold on really tightly on one side of the bulb.
Break away the black glass carefully and remove it.
Look at the bulb.
Use a flathead screwdriver to carefully snap the interior tube, using the screwdriver as a lever from the bottom.
Pull out any remaining wires and glass tube with the pliers.

,
Pour salt into the light bulb and shake it.
Use a screwdriver to break off any remaining bits of glass around the interior edge.
Obtain sand.
Dry the sand and spread it out on a cookie sheet.
Make sure that the sand is completely dry before continuing.
Pour approximately one cup of completely dry sand about Â¼ under the silver rim.
Tighten up the plastic bottle caps on both light bulbs.
Build the frame.
Look at your work so far.
Do a mock-up.
Finish.

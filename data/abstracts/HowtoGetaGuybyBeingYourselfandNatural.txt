Be yourself.
Wear cute clothes that make your body have feminine features.
Make-up: Don't wear too much eyeliner.
Try not to be nervous.
Make sure you don't just like him cause he is cute.
Be flirty, give compliments and laugh a lot at all of his jokes... don't call him "hot thing" or anything like that... that gives desperate and comical appearance, not a way to work it.
Interest It's easier if the guy you like likes the same stuff as you.
"Talk the talk" Don't be afraid to be seductive.
"Walk the walk" Hey girl when you walk past him swish those hips and accelerate that ass even, Show him your something to have and hold.
"It's all you" be yourself.
"Keep your life" If things work out, don't drop your friends or family for him.
"Time" Only time can determine the faith of your future.

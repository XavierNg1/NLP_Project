Plan other things during your visit, and let them know in advance.
Accept what your hosts offer you.

Be aware that some of your habits in your own home may not fly here.
Do not take command of a particular piece of furniture for the entire length of your stay.
When staying for extended periods of time (more than 2-3 days), do not expect your host to wait on your every beck and call.
Do not bore your hosts with tales of your aches and pains and how horrible it is to be your age.
Do not assume that just because you purchase meals or gifts or other items for your children that you are excused from any of the above items.
If you have grandchildren, please refrain from intentionally going against the rules their parents have set for them (and please do not make recommendations about how you think grandchildren should be raised).
Do not give your daughter-in-law unsolicited advice on her weight, how to clean, how to be a better mother, or how to be a better cook.
Do not spend the visit complaining.

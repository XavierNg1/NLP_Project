Keep in mind that you'll only be at camp for eight or more weeks.
Mentally select a girl with a compatible personality.
Be alert and listen to the conversations swirling around you whenever possible without looking like you're eavesdropping.
While you're figuring out as much as you can about the selected girl, pay attention to the other girls around you after a few days.
Take a week or so to sort the girls at your summer camp through your mind.
Now that you've selected the one girl you'll be focusing on for the whole of summer camp, make an effort to be near her.
At this point, remember to smile every time you make eye contact with her.
Review all information you know about her from her body language, posture, reactions to your contributions to conversations, etc.
If you feel that your relationship with her is strong enough to handle your serious talk, continue on.
Wait for the right moment to make your move.
Finished.

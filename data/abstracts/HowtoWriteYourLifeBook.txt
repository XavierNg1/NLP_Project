Find and purchase a sturdy, thick notebook with more than one hundred pages.
Start by writing a few sentence starters like "My name is...", "I am...years...months old", "My birthday is on..." etc.
On the next blank page write in big, bold bubble letters "MY OWN STORY".
Do not necessarily start by talking about your birth - it is not supposed to be in a chronological order!,
When you finish your first writing session hide the journal so that you can return to it later.
Before starting your new writing session leave a 3–10 centimeter (1.2–3.9 in) gap in between the previous writing session.
When your life book is finished, consider let people read certain parts.

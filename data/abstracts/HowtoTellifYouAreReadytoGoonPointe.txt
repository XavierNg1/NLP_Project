Make sure you’re old enough.
Take at least two years of prior ballet instructions.Though some students may be asked to wait longer, especially if they are not old enough, nobody should be considered for work on pointe until they have received, at minimum, two years of instruction in the fundamentals of ballet.
Check the bone structure of your foot.
Make sure you are at a healthy weight.
Check if you have a strong, straight core and upright pelvis when dancing.
See if you can do 16 relevés in a row in demi-pointe.Demi-pointe, also known as half-pointe, is when you balance on the balls of your foot rather than the toes of your foot.If you cannot perform 16 relevés in a row on demi-pointe from center, your muscles are not yet strong enough to go en pointe.
Be able to maintain correct turnout while dancing on flat foot or demi-pointe.If you can’t maintain correct turnout normally, you will have a lot of trouble maintaining it en pointe, because it’s more difficult to maintain turnout then.
Ask your teacher to assess your foot and ankle strength.
Build ankle strength.There are many exercises you can do outside of ballet steps that will build up ankle strength to ensure you’re performing technical steps safely.
Exercise with a Theraband.
Practice metatarsal doming.Metatarsal doming exercises strengthen the small, intrinsic muscles in the foot that you don’t think about on a day-to-day basis, but which are very important for proper technique.
Practice going on demi-pointe.
Practice steps and exercises that will prepare you for pointe.

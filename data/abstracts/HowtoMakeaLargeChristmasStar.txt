Gather the parts.
Cut the conduit in half so you have 6–5 feet (1.8–1.5 m) tubes.

,Drill a 3/8" hole through one end of 5 pieces of conduit 1" from one end

,
Bolt two pieces of conduit together using the 3" bolt.
Lay this "V" onto the ground and lay the drilled end of another 5 feet (1.5 m) section on the one end of the "V".
Continue with the remaining 2 pieces of conduit until you have bolted all five corners of the star together.
Notice that you have 5 points inside the star where the conduit crosses.
Now simply simply wrap the star with the lights.
To gain height, you can put a 10 feet (3.0 m) 1/2" metal conduit a foot inside a 10 feet (3.0 m) 3/4" metal conduit.

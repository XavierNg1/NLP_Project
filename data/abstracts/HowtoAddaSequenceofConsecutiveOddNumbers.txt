Generalize the formula.
Understand the difference between the two types of problems.
Let n equal the first number.
Write the remaining numbers in terms of n. Next, you will need to determine how to write the rest of the numbers in the sequence in terms of n. Because they are all consecutive odd numbers, there will be a difference of two between each number.
Complete your formula.
Simplify the equation.
Isolate n. The last step to solving this equation is to get n by itself on one side of the equation.

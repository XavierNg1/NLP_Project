Choose a thick cut of steak over a thin one.
Salt your steaks in advance and let them come to room temperature before pan frying.
Oil the pan with 1 to 2 teaspoons of neutral oil (canola or brown nut works fine) over high heat.
Lightly place the steak in the pan and begin to fry.
Decide whether you're going to flip the meat often or only once.
Cook the steak for anywhere from 3 to 6 minutes per side, depending on thickness and desired doneness.
About 2 minutes before steak is ready, add 2 tablespoons of butter into the pan, along with any herbs or aromatics.
Use a thermometer to test doneness.
About 5° F (3° C) before your steak is done, remove it from the pan and set it aside to cool.
Serve your steak and enjoy.

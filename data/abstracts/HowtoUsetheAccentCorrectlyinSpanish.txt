If you know how the word sounds, find the accented syllable.
If a word has an accent in it, the syllable containing the accent is the one that is stressed or emphasised.
All "flat" words have an accent if they end in a consonant other than "n" or "s" (the letter "y" is considered a consonant).
All "high-pitched" words have an accent if they end in a vowel, n, or s. These are words that have the accent on the last syllable: caerá, alhelí, así, camión, jamás.

The word "aun" is written with an accent only when it can be substituted for the word "todavía", for instance to mean "still".
This word "sólo" (meaning "only") has an accent in case of ambiguity about its adverbial form, in other words when it means "solamente".
Place an accent in the word "sí" when it means "yes;" omit the accent if it means "if.",
For adverbs ending in -mente, use the accent if the word that forms the stem originally had an accent.

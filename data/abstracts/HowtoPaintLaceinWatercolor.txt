Start by finding lace edged items.
Set up a still life using a lace edged cloth prominently displayed.
Sketch the still life in pencil.
Take a look at and appreciate a few of the many possible edgings.
Set up a palette of primary and secondary colors.
Gather brushes, all purpose and watercolor types.
Begin painting by indicating the shadows on the cloth or drape under the objects.
Paint in whatever order pleases you.
Doing lace is all about a technique called “negative painting.” This means you paint what isn’t there, the spaces around, rather than the filament or threads making up the lace.
Start lace by painting the edging as it appears against the table.
Try to train your eye to look beyond the stitches that make up the lace.
Paint the objects by first giving them a base coat.
Work all over the page.
Check to see whether one side of each object is slightly darker in value to give the illusion of roundness.
Mat, frame and hang your work to enjoy.

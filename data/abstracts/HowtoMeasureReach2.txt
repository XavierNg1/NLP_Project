Measure your height.
Ask your friend to make a mark on the wall, level with the top of your head.

,
Step away from the wall and help your friend measure straight up from the floor to the mark, to get your height.
Divide your reach measurement by your height to express your arm span as a ratio.
Subtract your height measurement from your reach measurement to get a more concrete "ape index" result.

Always have more than one assistant: In an ideal world one online assistant dedicated completely to your work is enough to get you through the day.
Gradually add more responsibilities to work: In this line of work, trust is paramount.
Prioritize your work: The prospect of dumping a list of tasks on your VA is extremely tempting, but cannot guarantee quality results.
Be unnecessarily detailed when instructing: When working with VAs, you cannot hope to instruct them vaguely.

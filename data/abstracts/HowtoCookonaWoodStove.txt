Heat up the stove by building a nice fire in it with the damper(s) wide open.
Get your cooking gear out and the ingredients ready.

,
As you heat up the stove, put a kettle or pot of water on to heat as well.
Test the top of the stove by tossing a DROP of water on it.
Vary your technique depending on what you're cooking:

To make soup, put on a pot, let it heat up well (keep the stove hot, adding wood as necessary and opening/closing the damper to try to maintain a temperature), fry whatever you want fried (meat, onion, etc) and add some boiling water or soup stock.
When done cooking, turn the dampers down and let the stove cool a bit, but keep that pan of water on there.

Take off the wall paintings or posters if there are any.
Put on some music to inspire you.
Look for stuff!,
You can also add drawings that you or your friends made for you.
Think carefully about how are you going to glue them to the wall.
Glue stuff to your wall!,
Keep adding stuff over time.
Go crazy!,
Don't put them all straight, turn pictures to different angles.
If you feel like it, you can put up your larger posters and use the spare space on them to place smaller items.

,
Save lots of cool photos you find on sites like Tumblr or Pinterest on to a memory stick.
Have fun!

Become familiar with Thrash Metal.
Learn guitar scales, chords, and note locations in order to find out what notes go together and what notes do not.

,
Learn alternate picking.
Be determined.
Play songs by other Thrash Metal bands and mess around with their riffs.
When you have a basic riff put together work with it until you decide it is acceptable.
If you are in a band, play your riff for the rest of your bandmates and get their opinions on the riff.
When you have a riff that sounds good but maybe isn't fast enough, use the double picking form.
Also make sure to know that not all Thrash riffs are fast.
Have fun and be open to anything.

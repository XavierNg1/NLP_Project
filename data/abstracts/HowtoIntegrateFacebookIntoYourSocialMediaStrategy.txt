Outbound marketing: In traditional marketing (outbound marketing) companies focus on finding customers.
Be aware that social media amplifies the impact of your content.
Think about the manner and type of information Facebook gathers.
Know which options to use.
Be aware that both groups and fan pages allow you to do these same things:

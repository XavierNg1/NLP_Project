Gather the tools and materials you will need.
Rip some 2x4 lumber 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) wide, various lengths.
Find a flat surface to lay out your pieces.
Align the back and seat frame members so the angle suits you, then place the back leg member underneath in a position that will allow you to scribe it to cut to length after you have fit the rest of the frame together.

,
Mark each framing member where it intersects the adjacent one.
Cut the marks you have scribed with your circular saw, and dry fit the pieces together.
Attach the frame in the configuration illustrated in the photo, using 2 inch (5.1 cm), number 12 wood screws.
Attach the front leg, fastening it through the joint of the rear leg and seat support to give this connection increased strength.

,
Stand the chair up on your work surface, and tilt it so that it is at the correct height and amount of reclining angle you want, then scribe either the front, rear, or both legs to cut them to length.
Cut strips of wood 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) wide, and 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) thick, about 20 inches (50.8 cm) long.
Attach three of the slats, one at the point where the back intersects the seat, one at the front of the seat, and one at the top of the back, as shown in the photo.
Square up your chair frame.
Finish attaching the slats for the seat and back of your chair.
Rip 1/2 inch (5.1 cm) thick strips of 1 1/2 inch (5.1 cm) wide lumber to attach to the back frame as a cross bracing to make the chair stable.
Cut the armrests, again, as shown in the photo.
Attach your armrests to the top of the front leg posts, and to the back frame.
Finish the chair if you like, but for all practical purposes, you are ready to go fishing.

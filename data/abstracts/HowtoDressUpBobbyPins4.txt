Cut a 10-inch (cc-centimeter) long piece of thin beading wire.
Slip the wire part-way through the bend in your bobby pin.
Twist the wire shut, then snip off the shorter piece of wire.
Thread the wire through your first bead.
Wrap the wire around the bumpy part of the bobby pin.
Thread another bead onto the wire, and wrap it through the bobby pin again.
Keep adding beads and wrapping the wire until you are one bead's width from the end of the bobby in.
Wrap the wire a few times around the tip of the bobby pin without adding any beads.
Pass the wire back through or under 2 to 3 beads, then snip it off.

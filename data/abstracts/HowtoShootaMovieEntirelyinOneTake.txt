Go door to door and tell them when the movie will be shot, so if they hear screaming or see flashlights, it's just you.
Planning is the key to everything.
Figure out a way to choreograph the camera and actors so they know when and where to go at any given points.
Gather your actors.
Rehearse.
If you're going for a found-footage type movie, then use a freehand camera.
Lighting sets the mood.
If there are going to be any stunts, take extra safety cautions!,
Teach the actors to scream without hurting themselves.
Give the plot a good twist to surprise the audience.
When the movie is finished, and you've cleaned everything up, have a viewing party!,
Distribute the film.
If the movie is truly in one take, you won't have to do any editing other than the credits.
Finished.

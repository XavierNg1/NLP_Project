Communicate with your eyes.
Raise your eyebrows just the tiniest bit whenever he smiles, nods, winks, etc.
Look down and flutter your eyelashes a little.
Push your tongue against the skin below your bottom teeth.
When your eyes meet with his, move your shoulder forward slightly and then let it drop.
Once you've glanced at him quickly, look away and continue on with whatever you were doing.
Get close.
Involve your hair.
Remember to be yourself.

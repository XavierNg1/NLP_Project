Begin a Forge session on the Longshore map.
Enter editor mode (or oracle form) by pressing UP on the D-Pad once you have begun play.
Go to the back of the map, next to the defenders base.
Locate the white garage door with "DO NOT BLOCK" printed on it, next to the defenders base.
Fly over the water to the left of the garage door until you reach an 'S' shaped, metal vent running down the back wall.
Fly to the side of the vent, close to the wall, to where it connects to the building at the bottom.
Go around the vent until you can land on top of the skull.
Check your Xbox 360 gamerscore and achievement statistics and you will see that the Longshore Skull achievement has been unlocked for 25 gamerscore.

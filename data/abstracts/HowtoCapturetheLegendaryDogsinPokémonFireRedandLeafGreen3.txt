Know that the Legendary Dogs are some of the hardest Pokémon to catch.
Make sure you get to attack first by upping your Pokémon's speed.
Use blocking attacks to immediately prevent the dog from escaping.
Put the dog to sleep, freeze it, or paralyze it to make it easier to catch.
Try to prevent the dog from using Roar.
Weaken the dog until it has less than 10% of its health left.
Use as many Ultra Balls as you can to capture the Pokémon.
Alternatively, use your Master Ball on the very first turn.

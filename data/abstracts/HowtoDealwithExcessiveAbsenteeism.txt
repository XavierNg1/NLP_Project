Consider if there is a legitimate reason for the absenteeism.Sometimes, employees have compelling reasons for being absent.
Understand what unexcused absences can mean.If you cannot determine that there is a legitimate reason for an employee’s absences, or if they are excessive, you will want to take steps to deal with the situation.
Don’t ignore the problem.While it may not be pleasant, if an employee has a problem with excessive absenteeism, it is necessary to deal with it.
Assess your management style.
Set up a meeting.To directly address an employee’s absenteeism, set up a meeting between yourself, the employee, and any other relevant individuals (such as another supervisor or human resources representative, if applicable) to discuss the situation.
Give the employee a chance to explain.
Make a decision and get it in writing.If your workplace has an explicit policy regarding absenteeism, and the employee is in violation of that policy, then you will have to act in accordance with that policy.
Terminate the employee, if necessary.
Develop a clear absenteeism policy.Many instances of absenteeism can be prevented if your workplace institutes a clear, written policy regarding leave and work time.
Track employee attendance.You can help employees follow workplace policies, and know where they stand in terms of work time and absences, by tracking their attendance.
Institute performance reviews.

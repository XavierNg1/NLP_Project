Before you shoot the bow, draw it back ten times an hour until you can easily pull back a 40 or 45 pound draw (most state hunting minimums).
When you are ready to shoot, make sure you have arrows of the correct length (arrow should stick out an inch past the arrow rest at full draw) and grain.
Draw back, steady your aim, and let the arrow fly.
The big thing you must do, is draw back and stick your thumb straight out, like your giving someone a thumbs up, and turn it sideways until you can put it behind your neck, then tuck your chin in, as if you were nodding your head, until the tip of your nose on the side nearest to the string actually touches the string.

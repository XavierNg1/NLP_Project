Use this method to find the height of a tree without doing any math.
Fold a piece of paper in half so that it forms a triangle.
Hold the triangle in front of one eye.
Move back from the tree until you can sight the top of the tree at the top tip of the triangle.
Mark this spot and measure the distance from it to the base of the tree.

Take note that ants adore sweet things.
Do not leave bags or other containers that hold sweet things open to ants.
Clear things away.
Make sure to thoroughly clean out any appliances that you keep out on the counter, such as stand-up mixers.
Remove all crumbs.
Dump the crumbs out of your toaster regularly.
Line the borders of your cupboards with ground black pepper as an extra precaution.
Remove the ant and its trail.
Use traps.

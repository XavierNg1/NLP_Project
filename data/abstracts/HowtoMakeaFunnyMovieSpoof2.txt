Breakdown the visual style of the movies you're spoofing, and shoot it similarly if possible.
Give your actors characters to reference for their performance.
Play the ridiculous moments "straight" for the funniest results.
Pay attention to costumes and set design, mimicking the original as much as possible to make it feel like a sequel.
Toss in visual jokes that mimic or mock the original.
Allow a little seriousness into the film to make the comedy hit harder.
Aim for a quick, high-paced film, especially in comedic moments.

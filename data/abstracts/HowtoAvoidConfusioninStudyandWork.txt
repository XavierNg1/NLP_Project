Have an "Ah Ha" moment.
Decide some areas of your abilities and things that are interesting to learn.
Keep up your stamina and enthusiasm in the areas of your strengths and interests to find your best abilities and greatest opportunities that will fit your personality.
Focus mainly on one thing -- one at one time, and not much else, and let almost every ounce of effort go into that so that it will become a real area of strength -- not confusion.
Keep on doing what you decided to do.
Improve yourself and your chances and you will not be confused.
Do not stop and start--or quit halfway through--because if you do not accept or reject theories or ideas blindly, then you can be clear about your purposes and keep going.
Continue to build your strength of faith and your ability to learn and to earn -- with faith in your ability to improve abilities and skills by being persistent and reliable -- believing that you're blessed.
Follow-through: stopping halfway is confusing and shows a pattern of mixed up thinking.

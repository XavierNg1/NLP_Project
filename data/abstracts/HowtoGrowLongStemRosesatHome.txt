Plant rose varieties that are best suited to produce homegrown long-stem roses.
Read the care instructions very carefully for the rose variety you select.
Use garden shears to prune away all but the topmost bud on each stem of your rose bush.
Use your shears to cut off any surrounding or supporting branches on each stem.
Select a fertilizer specifically made for roses to nourish your flowers.
Water the rose bushes every 2 days.
Spray the buds with a misting bottle once they form, and continue to mist them every time you water.

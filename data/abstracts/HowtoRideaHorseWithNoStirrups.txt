Begin with core strengthening exercises.
Warm up your legs and your horse properly.
Bring the horse to a halt.
Cross your right stirrup over the front of the horse's neck or saddle followed by the left.
Check your position while the horse is still standing.
Take a deep breath and ask for walk.
Re-check your position, keep your hands off the saddle and make sure you aren't pulling on the reins.
If you need to hook a finger through the neck strap and/or hold on to the pommel to pull yourself into the seat, have a friend lead the horse for you so you don't pull on your horse's mouth.
Try posting to the trot.
If you are considering to canter, practice sitting to the trot without stirrups.
If you trotted sitting without difficulty, call for the canter gait.

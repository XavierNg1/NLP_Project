Monitor their bedtime routine.
Keep your eyes on them.
Listen for clues.
Be patient.
Wear quiet clothing.
Keep your body from giving you away.
Control your breathing.
Plan your path.
Prepare your eyes for darkness.
Walk silently by rolling your feet.
Freeze if they move or are facing you.
Hide in the shadows.

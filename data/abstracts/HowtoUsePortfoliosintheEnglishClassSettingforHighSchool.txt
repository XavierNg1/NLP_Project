At the beginning of the semester, take a few minutes during class work time (or individual reading time) to pull each student aside and discuss learning goals for that semester.
Explain that this portfolio must contain, at each grade level, two different samples of creative writing (for example, a poem and a short story - but not two poems or two short stories), one of an essay, one of a written assessment for a novel study/unit test, and one of a presentation/project, all to represent parts of GLO and SLO various requirements pertaining to each of these categories.
Take some class time to give students the chance to go through past assignments and decide what they feel is an accurate representation of improvements on their goals.
Revisit and reassess goals at mid semester.
At the end of the semester, have students write a self reflection based on the achievement of their goals.
The following year, review past goals with each student.

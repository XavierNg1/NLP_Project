Choose the paint colors you are going to use.
Cut the blank pieces of paper into inch-thick strips, or whatever size is appropriate.
Begin painting the strips.
Stop painting once you have gotten four strips, if that is the desired length.
Tape the painted strips together.
Tape the large strip to the top of the doorframe.
You are now finished and your curtain is ready to be used!

Do your research and find a meal plan that suits your taste and lifestyle.
Don’t “buy” into a plan where you need to buy products, potions or only eat “their” food.
Make sure your plan does not eliminate too many foods or food groups; otherwise you are prone to get bored quickly due to lack of variety.
Same as above, you may end up eating a lot of chicken.
Try new vegetables.
Drink water.
Experiment with different herbs and spices and make your own spice blend as you go.
Vary your favorite cooking method.
Have fun and play with your food.

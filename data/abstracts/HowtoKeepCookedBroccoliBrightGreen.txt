First, when cooking green vegetables, be careful not to steam them.
Use a large amount of water, then add salt.
Always bring the water to a boil before you add the vegetables.
Only cook the vegetables until they are tender.
It is also important to stop the cooking process as soon as the vegetable is cooked perfectly.
Prepare your vegetables however you like them, and enjoy them with your eyes, as well as your taste buds.

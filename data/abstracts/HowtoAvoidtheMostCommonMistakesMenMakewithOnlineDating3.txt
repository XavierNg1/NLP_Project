After an introduction, suggest meeting for coffee and a chat to see if you like each other.
Choose the time and place if you're making the invite.
Set your expectations low before the first date.
Ask enough questions to keep the conversation flowing, but don't ask a long series of unrelated personal questions as if you are conducting an interview.
Be relaxed during your date together.

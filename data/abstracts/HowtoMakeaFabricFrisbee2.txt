Use a Frisbee to trace a circle on a piece of fabric, including seam allowances.
Draw a narrow rectangle on the fabric, long enough to wrap around the Frisbee.
Cut the fabric out along the lines that you drew.
Sew the narrow ends of the rectangle together to make a loop.
Press the seam open with an iron.
Fold one of the raw edges over twice to make the hem.
Topstitch the hem down, leaving a small gap.
Pin the loop to the circle with the right sides facing in.
Sew around the circle.
Thread some elastic through the loop's hem.
Sew the ends of the elastic together.
Turn the cover inside out.

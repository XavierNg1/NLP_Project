The ferrite rod antenna in an AM radio uses the property of core material permeability to reduce the length of wire and concentrates the signal.As an option you can add a variable air capacitor parallel to this ferrite,
antenna, this will give you increased Q that and better frequency selection.
If you are determined to keep antenna length short (which still means reduced reception) and you have access to electronic-grade ferrite or iron rods, a better antenna than most portable radios can be constructed by going bigger.
Radio waves are far easier to capture with a copper wire antenna, which is nothing more than a piece of wire stretched between two points, with ceramic, glass, or plastic insulators at each end.
The wire may be tied directly to both insulators but as various things (like the tree) move over time, the wire will stretch.
If the long wire doesn't give you an acceptable AM signal, one additional option remains: you can add a loading inductor (a type of coil you can make yourself) before the antenna lead enters the radio.
A common ham radio trick is to make a loading coil with plastic pipe fittings or pipe and insulated 22 gauge wire.

Find an Airline willing to transport your dog.
Consider the length of your trip.
Make sure you have an FAA approved crate for your dog to travel in.
Make a list of supplies (some suggested at the bottom).
Take your dog for a checkup before your trip.
Feed your dog in about four hours advance so he will become less likely to eliminate or vomit during the flight.
Prepare the crate.
Don't get your dog over-excited.
If you can't see your dog being loaded onto the plane, ask the counter agent to call the ramp to make sure he is safely on board.
After your dog is out of cargo, make sure that he is healthy and not injured.

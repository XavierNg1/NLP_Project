Understand concert pitch.
Understand the relationship between C and F. C is a perfect fifth, or 7 semitones, higher than F. To help you visualize what that means, look at a music staff and count the lines and spaces from C down to F. You will see the following notes: C, B, A, G, F. There are five whole tones comprising the jump between C and F.It may be helpful to look at a keyboard, or even a picture of a keyboard as you count whole and semi tones.

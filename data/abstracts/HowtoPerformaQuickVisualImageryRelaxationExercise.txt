Sit comfortably in your chair with your feet flat on the floor.
Close your eyes.
Imagine yourself being bathed in a brilliant white light.
Relax the muscles.
Allow yourself a moment to bask in the warmth of the light.

,
With each inward breath, breathe in the light.
As you breathe out, release every last bit of tension and stress.

,
Feel the beautiful white light flowing through your body, renewing your very soul with peace and calm and positive energy.

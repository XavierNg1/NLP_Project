Grate your cheese ahead of time -- roughly 2 tablespoons per quesadilla.
Put your frying pan on the stove on medium-high.
Lightly grease the pan with a pat of butter or vegetable oil.
Fill one-half of the tortilla with roughly 2 tablespoons of cheese.
Fold the tortilla over the cheese and add to the hot pan.
Flip after the bottom is golden-brown, usually 3-4 minutes.
Remove and serve once both sides of the tortilla are crisp and golden and the cheese is melted.

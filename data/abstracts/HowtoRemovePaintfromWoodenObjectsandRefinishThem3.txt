Now you may use a very dangerous but easier method.
Warm small areas of the wood up (but not too much so the wood doesn't turn to crisp or there isn't a burn mark).

Now you may pack everything up and turn off the Heat Gun so that nothing gets in your way.
Now you can make it smooth - scrape the object with Sandpaper and your choice of grain.

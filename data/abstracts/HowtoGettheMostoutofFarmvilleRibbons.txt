Complimentary Sets: Some of the accomplishments rewarded by ribbons are complimentary, but some others are not.
Some separate ribbons are complimentary, however.
A Winning Layout: You can also change the layout of your farm in order to earn ribbons more quickly.
Sharing in the Wealth: Since you can share the wealth with your friends every time you earn a ribbon, you should be sure to take advantage of all of the bonuses you can earn when your friends collect ribbons as well.

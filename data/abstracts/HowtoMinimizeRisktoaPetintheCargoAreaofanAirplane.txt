Understand the risks.
Exhaust all other alternatives.
Research airlines.
Ask each airline about its animal welfare policy.
Book the same flight as your pet so that you can supervise the trip (described further in later steps).
Buy a strong carrier.
Ask the airline if you can watch your pet being loaded and unloaded into and out of the cargo hold.
When you board the plane, notify the Captain (through the flight crew, that is, a flight attendant) that your pet is traveling in the cargo hold.
After checking your pet in at the ticket counter, make sure to read the claim check back to the agent to ensure that the pet is checked to the correct final destination with you.

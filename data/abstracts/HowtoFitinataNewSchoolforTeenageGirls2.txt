The night before you start school, make sure your schoolbag is prepared and that everything you need is in it.
Next, check tomorrow's weather so that you are aware of the temperature and what type of clothing you should wear.
Your hairstyle doesn't need to be fancy; it can just be your favorite.
Set your alarm clock at an appropriate time to wake up, keeping in mind that it isn't healthy to wake up too early or late.
Memorize your schedule.
Be sure any forms or applications that require your parents' signature and/or yours have been filled out and completed.

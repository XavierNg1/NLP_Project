When choosing lockers, try to get a locker that is close to the majority of your classes.
Keep your locker organized!,
Ask the main office for a map of the school.
Make sure you know when to go to your locker.
Get to school early so you have some time to organize your locker.
If you aren't very assertive, you may get held up in the hallway.
Avoid having to go to your locker between classes.
If you need to go to the bathroom, ask a teacher about 2 minutes before the bell rings so that you can still have enough time to go to the bathroom without being late to your next class.

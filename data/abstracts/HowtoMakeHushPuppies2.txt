Simplify your liquids to just milk and two eggs for a denser, easier hush puppy.
Consider a denser, all cornmeal variation.
Add a shredded green bell pepper for a Cajun/Creole twist.
Throw in 8 ounces of fresh crab meat for crab cake hush puppies.
Substitute a half can of beer for the buttermilk for a tangier, lighter treat.
Bake the hush puppies in a muffin tin at 450F/230C for 10 minutes for a low-fat option.
Finished.

Realize that dialog boxes are displayed when there could be a liability issue that could ensue.
Respond to the dialog box.
Close the dialog box from the alternate buttons.
Use a context-Close task from the taskbar listing for the dialog box that appears.
Utilize the Task Manager in Windows (if you are operating these on a Windows PC).
Close the entire program and any other programs that are open.
Save your work (if the program still allows you to, since some programs work in the background away from the dialog box) and restart the entire system from scratch.

Set up a double boiler.
Get some goat's milk melt-and-pour soap base, then cut it into smaller cubes.You will need 1 pound (453 grams) of the melt-and-pour soap base.
Place the soap into the pouring pot, and melt it over medium heat.
Take the soap base off the heat once it melts, then stir in 10 to 15 drops of grapefruit essential oil.
Stir in Â¼ cup (66.5 grams) of pink Himalayan salt.If you can't find any pink Himalayan salt, you can use sea salt instead, but avoid Dead Sea salt.
Pour the soap into the molds.
Wait for the soap to harden for at least 2 hours, then take it out of the mold.If the soap is still soft after you take it out, set it down on a baking sheet, and let it finish drying.

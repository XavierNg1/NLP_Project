Measure the wall that you wish to build a brick veneer around and calculate the amount of materials necessary.
Wet the brick a couple hours before you begin the building process.
Outline the first course of the brick veneer.
Screed a 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) layer of mortar as a foundation for the first course.Lay the first course of brick being certain to retain a 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) joint between each brick.Screed a 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) top joint over the first course and lay the second brick course on top of the first.
Create a small corner lead on top of the first 2 courses.
Pull a string line taut from the base of the veneer to the top, along the corner lead of the wall covering.
Tool the joints between the bricks and courses after every 2 to 3 courses using a concave jointer.Continue spreading mortar and building each course until you have reached the goal height of your brick veneer.

Get your priorities straight.
Greet your remaining feelings openly and honestly.
Focus on your goals.
Seek support from others.Even if you and your ex still talk occasionally, make sure that your ex is not the person you call in extreme moments.
Stay focused on the present.
Lay down terms of engagement.
Claim the distance that you want.
Pay attention to your body language.Not sure how you're coming off to your ex and other co-workers?,
Talk out differences.
Put a stop to game playing.
Know when enough is enough.
Separate your work and personal life.
Keep emotional baggage outside of your professional dealings.
Stick close to other co-workers.
Resist involving colleagues in residual drama.Misery attracts company, and mentioning that you are having issues with your ex will make the issue "fair game" for your colleagues to discuss.
Stay on task with work-related topics.
Increase your non-work social life.All of the new stress created from sharing a workplace with your ex might make you want to ramp up your activities and relationships elsewhere.

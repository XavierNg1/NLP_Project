Cover a large baking sheet with wax paper.
Fill a large bowl with 4 cups (400 grams) of Golden Graham cereal and 3 cups (300 grams) of Chex cereal.
Put the peanut butter and 1 cup (175 grams) of chocolate chops into a microwave-safe bowl.
Microwave the peanut butter and chocolate for 30 seconds, then stir.
Stir in 1 cup (100 grams) of the mini marshmallows to the melted mixture.
Pour the mixture over the cereal, and stir with a spatula until the cereal is evenly coated.
Transfer the cereal mixture into a 2 gallon (7.6 liter) resealable bag.
Add the powdered sugar.
Zip the bag shut, then shake it until the cereal is completely coated with powdered sugar.
Use a spatula to spread the coated cereal across the wax paper so that it can cool.
Transfer the cereal into a clean bowl and stir in remaining chocolate chips, mini marshmallows, and cereal.
Serve the muddy buddies.

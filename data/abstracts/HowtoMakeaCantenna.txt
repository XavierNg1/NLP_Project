Find a can that is no more than 4 inches (10.2Â cm) wide in diameter.
Use the table below to calculate how far you will drill the hole for placement of an N type Female Chassis-mount connector.
Drill a hole in the can at the correct position according to your calculation or the center rib of a Progresso Soup can.
Widen the hole to accommodate the adapter.








,
Place the adapter in the hole and secure to the can.
Attach a pigtail cable to the adapter (a pigtail is a wire that attaches the adapter to the computer's wifi card, note you must have a compatible wifi adapter to make this work).
Connect the cantenna and wifi card with the pigtail or BNC connectors.








,
Tape cantenna to tripod or create a small, portable stand or clamp with a bit of thick wire that loops around the BNC connectors and can be easily removed and allows you to rotate the cantenna to find signals.








,
Aim at source and adjust to get the best signal.
Finished.

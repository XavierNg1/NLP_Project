First you need your car.
,
Now you need your cordless drills.
Start by draining all the fluids.
Unbolt the engine and use the hoist to lift the engine out.
Get a bit of cardboard and put it on the gearbox.
Get an oxyacetylene cutter and cut the shape out and the bolt holes too.
Get the drills and take note of what shape it is at the end.
Remove the clutch and temporarily fit the adapter plate so you know where the bigger gear engages.
Mount the drills using cable ties and fit the batteries on.
Remove all the parts of the switches on all of the drills and wire a red wire and a black wire to each.
Remove the accelerator and clutch pedal and only leave the brake pedal.

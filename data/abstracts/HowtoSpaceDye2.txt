Cut your fabric into pieces – fat quarter size works well.
Arrange fabrics in a container – you can make formal pleats or just scrunch it in.
Drip or spoon dye onto areas of the fabric.
Using rubber gloves, press the fabric down firmly until no white is showing.
Pour washing soda solution over the fabric, making sure all areas of fabric are in contact with the solution.
Take the container to the sink and pour excess dye away.

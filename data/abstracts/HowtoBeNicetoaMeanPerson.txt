Take a few deep, calming breaths.
Look at the situation objectively.
Step away from the situation.
Speak to that person as if your grandma was listening.
Listen to the person.
Ask them specific questions.
Do tangible acts of kindness for the mean person.
Be genuine.
Reflect on their words.
Remember a time you lashed out at someone.
Break the cycle.
Find something you have in common with them.
Remember how you want to look.
Do it for your health.
Preserve the bridges.

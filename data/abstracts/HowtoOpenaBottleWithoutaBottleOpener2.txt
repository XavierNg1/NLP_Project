One great tool is a staple remover.
Also consider using the prongs from a lamp or other electrical device.
Try sticking the bottle into a door jamb, at the metal plate.
Alternatively, place the edge of the bottle cap on any edge (preferably metal).
A wedding or class ring is an ideal way to remove a soda or beer bottle cap.
Note that you can pry off the cap with virtually any strong metal with an edge that you have handy.
You can use the back edge of a Chef's knife (use a knife with a wide enough blade so that the sharp edge is not on your skin), the handle of a serving spoon, tongs, a stainless bowl, closed scissors, a stapler, a screwdriver, a putty knife, a cocktail strainer handle.
A pair of standard handcuffs make a good bottle opener, and often a simultaneous conversation-starter.

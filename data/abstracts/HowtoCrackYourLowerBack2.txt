Lay face-down on a firm surface, your arms by your sides.
Instruct your partner to place their dominant foot on your lower back.
Ask your partner to bend down, gently grab your hands and slowly lift your arms upwards.
Guide your partner to slowly pull your arms up while keeping their foot firmly positioned on the small of your back.
Listen for the pop, or feel like your back cracks!

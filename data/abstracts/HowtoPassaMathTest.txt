Prepare for class.
When you go home, take your notes and/or textbook.
Review the new concepts and processes, plus math tables, if any, that you need.
Study the math theory.
Eat a good breakfast.
Take the test.
Know how to use the whole time allotted for the math test.
Master the art of multiple choice.
Master the art of math homework.
After you get the marked test back, review your mistakes.
Take your math scores to the next level, not only ensuring that you get all of your homework done as described above (by redoing the homework until it is all correct--and then giving it another go), but about a week or maximum two weeks before the exam, not only continue to do the homework -- but also take extra time each night to redo every single past homework problems that will be tested on the exam.
Experiment, if you have a problem you can't figure out -- or if you can't remember a rule: Use simple numbers to simplify it to its easiest form to work through by, for instance, substituting in the smallest numbers possible to determine the solution.
Choose between reading the text and getting problems done: The solution is always to do problems (sigh of relief).
Learn more than one way to understand the subject (develop depth in whatever you are studying) and enjoy the good results!,
Think positively to improve your confidence and effectiveness on the test.

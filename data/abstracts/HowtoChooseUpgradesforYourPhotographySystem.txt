Be aware of what is really important in terms of photography equipment.
Consider what situations you subject your photography equipment to.
When considering the number of photos over which a purchase is likely to be amortized, bear in mind that some photos require contrasting factors:


Modest appearance to avoid damage (to camera or photographer) from rough people.
Look for compensatory possibilities.
Consider inter-compatibility.
Don't generally consider camera equipment an investment, though lenses and, in particular, non-automated lenses (being a mature technology with less to become incompatible over time) do tend to retain much of their value.
Judge the value of the equipment by its returns relevant to your needs.
Think about economy of scale.
Given the foregoing information, here is a suggested upgrade path:


Start with moderately-priced compact digital camera with some manual setting capability.
Finished.

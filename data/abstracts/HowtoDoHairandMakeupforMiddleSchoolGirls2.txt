For quick hairstyles when you're on the run, try a simple ponytail clipped up with a large, colorful alligator clip.
Try a half ponytail.
Quiffs are cute as well, and can be worn with pretty much any outfit.
Ponytails are excellent for mornings when you find that your hair is oily or gross-looking, and you don't have time to wash it!

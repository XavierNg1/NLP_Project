Have your vital signs monitored.The first thing that will happen when you arrive in the Emergency Department is that a nurse will check your vital signs, including your respiration rate, your pulse, your blood pressure, and other important data such as the oxygen levels in your blood.
Have activated charcoal administered if needed.If you have ingested a toxic substance (including pill overdoses), the emergency room physician may give you activated charcoal.
Be aware of other tests and treatments you may need.You may need to go for a CT scan, have an ECG (a test on your heart), and/or have blood or urine tests done to help your doctor to confirm the diagnosis and the source of your poisoning.

Learn which machine suits your style.
Before a Grand Prix, study EVERY track that you will be racing on in the machine you will be using.

,
Don't worry about victory on the first lap.
As soon as the race starts, crush as many people as you can.
Boost as much as possible JUST BEFORE hitting the Pit Strips.
Don't Boost if you don't need to.
Keep in mind that you don't have to win every race in order to win the title.
Above all, have fun.

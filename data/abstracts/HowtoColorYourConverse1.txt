Start with a clean shoe.
Get some permanent markers or fabric markers.
Come up with a design, and practice it on a sheet of paper or scrap of fabric.
Sketch your design on the shoe using a pencil.
Color in your design, starting with the lightest colors first and finishing with the darkest.
Wait until the ink dries before adding the outlines, if desired.
Spray the fabric part of the shoe with a shoe sealant or a waterproofing spray.You can also use a spray-on acrylic sealer.
Wait until the sealer dries before putting the laces back in and wearing your shoes.
Finished.

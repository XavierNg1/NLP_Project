Choose a pair of satiny, silky exercise shorts.
Turn them inside out or keep the shorts right side out.

Arrange your hair into an even shape around your head.

Pull the waistband of the shorts over your head and hair.

Pull the drawstring tight, and tie it in a bow.

Tie the pants legs together with a bit of string or a hair tie.

Tuck in any loose hairs, and you're good to go.

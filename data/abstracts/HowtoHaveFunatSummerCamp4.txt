Accept that this is the last day you will be at camp for a while.
Gather the email addresses/phone numbers/addresses of camp friends you would like to stay in touch with.
The day before you leave, pack your suitcase.
When you go to sleep on that last night, think about all the fantastic memories you've made.
Always be positive, and do not be a party pooper.

Examine the surface where your blinds are attached.
Locate some tie-downs.
With the blinds down, hold the tie-down in place and mark the corresponding screw holes with a pencil.

,
If you're attaching the hold-down to a steel door or a wooden window frame, you can just directly screw the holder down.

,
If it is drywall or plaster, you'll need to use an anchor plug.
If it's brick or concrete, you'll need to use a special screw made for these surfaces (Tap-con).
Once you have the hold-downs attached to the wall, simply snap them onto the bottom of your blinds to prevent them from blowing.

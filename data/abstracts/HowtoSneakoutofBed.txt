Before you head to bed, wear a pair of socks or keep slippers beside your bed.
If you are near enough your parents room to hear them snore (if they do), listen quietly.
Slowly (especially if you share a room with a sibling) get out of bed.
Slip on your slippers (if you weren't wearing socks) and walk at a steady pace to your bedroom door.
Go to the room you wish to go to.
If you are planning to play on the computer, keep in mind that you should keep a very low volume, or even better, no volume at all.
NOTE: Somebody could walk out of their room to get a snack, and chances are they will turn on lights.
If all has been successful, close the device, turn off the TV, or shut down the computer and walk on your tip-toes out of the room and make your way back into your bedroom.

When you open the door, turn the knob slowly and wait a few seconds.
Slowly walk through the room to your bed.

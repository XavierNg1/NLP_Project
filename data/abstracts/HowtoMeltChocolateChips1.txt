Fill a saucepan with 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water.
Bring the water to a boil over medium heat.
Take the saucepan off the burner.
Put the chocolate into your second saucepan.If you are using a makeshift double boiler, then put the chocolate into your heat-safe bowl instead.
Place the upper saucepan (or bowl) on top of your lower saucepan.
Wait for the chocolate to melt most of the way, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula.
Take the upper saucepan or bowl off the bottom one, and set it down on the counter.
Continue to stir the chocolate until the mixture is smooth and there are no chunks of chocolate left.
Use the chocolate in your recipe.

You can use two statements in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications to perform a conditional test: an If...Then...Else statement or a Select Case statement.
Note that the If...Then...Else statement executes a group of statements based on the value of an expression, and the Select Case statement executes one of several of statements based on the value of an expression.
Copy the above code into Word, or a similar application, and REPLACE ALL the "#** " with nothing(s).
Open Excel and check Developer under Preferences on the Ribbon Option, to enable you to work with macros.

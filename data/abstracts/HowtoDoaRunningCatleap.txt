Start running at a pace that'll give you enough momentum to leap the distance, but don't go so fast that you take off with excessive force.
Take off by jumping up more than across.
Use your body to "swim" across the air if you feel so inclined.
Kick your leg(s) forward as you near the wall to help reduce the force with which you'll hit the wall ahead.

,
Grab the ledge at the same time your leg meets the wall.
Brace yourself for the collision.
Push upwards and slightly outwards with your feet and use your arms to pull yourself up to the top of the wall and keep running.

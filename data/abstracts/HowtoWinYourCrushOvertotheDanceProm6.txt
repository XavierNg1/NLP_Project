A week before the prom/dance, purchase a tuxedo that fits you.
If you discover no tuxedos within your price range, a crisp, formal collared shirt tucked into formal pants with a tie and dress shoes would be perfectly acceptable.
On the day of the prom/dance, take a shower to make sure you smell fine.
Put on the formal clothes that you have picked out for this occasion.
Comb your hair nicely and apply gel if needed.
Put on your dress shoes and a jacket if needed.
Hold yourself in a tall, confident position by throwing back your shoulders the slightest bit.
Meet your crush and give her a friendly, "Hey.",
Don't be afraid to dance with your crush, but remember that you don't have to dance to every single song that is playing.
If she smiles at you, let a friendly grin slip out from your mouth, but avoid looking creepy or smiling too widely.

If you're lucky, you two might kiss or become a couple.

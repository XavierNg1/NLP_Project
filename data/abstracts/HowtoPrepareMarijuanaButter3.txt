Adjust the amount of marijuana, not the butter, if you want to change the strength.
Quick cook some butter in under an hour if you want a quick edible treat.
Use a slow cooker for hands-free marijuana butter.
Try using clarified butter (ghee) for a smoother-tasting cannabutter.
Spray your toasted buds with a little high-proof alcohol, like Everclear, before adding to the butter.
Blanch your marijuana beforehand for a relatively scentless, flavorless butter.

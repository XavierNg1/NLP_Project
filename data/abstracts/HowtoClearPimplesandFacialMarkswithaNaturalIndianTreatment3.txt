Make washing a regular part of your routine.
Use a gentle, plant-oil based cleansing product.
Use your fingertips to wash your face.
Massage the skin gently.You may be tempted to scrub at your skin during your daily washing, but this is a bad idea.
Avoid exfoliation.Exfoliation can be good for healthy skin, but you shouldn't try to exfoliate acne-covered skin.
Do not ever pop your pimples.Pimples, pustules, blackheads, and so on may look unattractive, but theyâ€™re actually working to keep the bacteria in your skin contained.

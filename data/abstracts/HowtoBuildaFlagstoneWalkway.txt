Buy your flagstones.
Once you are home, lay out the shape of the path you want with garden hose laid on the ground.
Remove all grass and topsoil 4 inches (10.2 cm) deep from the path area.
Spread sand to a depth of 2 inches (5.1 cm).
Set the flagstones into place, with a border between each of at least an inch.
Spread more sand on top and sweep it to fill up the spaces between stones.

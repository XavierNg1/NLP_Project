First off, choose a printing company.
Once you’ve chosen a printing company, you’ll need to fill out an order form.
Fill out the order form by first choosing your paper stock.
You’ll need to choose the correct drop-down choice of whether you need a two-sided business card, and if so, if both of those sides will be 4-color.
Pick the quantity you need from another drop-down list.
Next, choose the turnaround time.
Choose the type of coating you want.
Upload your design file.
You’ll get a PDF of the color proof (a sample of what your business card will look like).
Then you pay with your credit card.

If you have holiday fabric you are off to a great start.
You will need to choose two pieces of fabric.
Create your holiday themed design on the outer background fabric before you assemble it.
You will need batting for the middle layer.
There are many purse patterns on the internet.
When you are satisfied with your themed purse, make a 1" binding going around the top of both sides of the purse to add durability and to later attach the handle(s).
Now is the time to make a handle too.
Return to your purse design, making sure all the layers still line up.
Make a closure by taking a small strip of fabric about 8" long 3-4" wide.

To find the Demand Curve and Function for a single product, one must understand that in standard Economics, the relationship is inverse: Price Y determines Units Demanded X, or f(y) = x.
Create the Column Headings and columns for the Data Findings per Research data subset of the Regression worksheet:


Into cell A2, enter #.
Input the Prices at which Demand was found:


Into cell A3, enter 1 and select cell range A3:A16 and do Edit Fill Series Column Linear Step Value 1, OK.
Enter the number of Units Sold ("UNIT FINDS") per research at the above prices into column C:


From C3:C16, top to bottom, enter the following units: 60, 58, 57, 56.5, 51.75, 48.5, 46, 43, 40.5, 39.25, 32.5, 32, 31.25 and 27.

,
Enter the slope m's Numerator and Denominator column formulas:


Select cell range D3:D16 and enter to D3 w/o quotes the formula "=(C3-X_BAR)*(B3-Y_BAR)" and Edit Fill Down.
Find slope m, x intercept b and the Forecast Unit Sales based on the Mean Price:


Enter m to cell D18 and into cell E18 enter the formula w/o quotes "=D17/E17".
Determine the coordinates of the Regression Line of the Demand Function Curve per research:


Enter to cell D23 Line P=Y and enter to cell E23 Regression Line X
Enter the following Prices to cell range D24:D28, top to bottom: 0, 10, "=Y_BAR", 35, "=-$E$19/$E$18".
Create the Chart "Regression Line Demand Function Curve per Research Findings"


Copy E23:E28 and Paste to A23:A28.
Next, we'll do the data and chart for a curve that is not a straight line, using Multi-Variable Analysis, via pieces until we arrive at a curve that's an acceptable percentage within difference from the findings.

,
Enter the Preliminary Headings and Data:


Into cell A34, enter n. Into cell A35, enter 1 and select cell range A35:A51 and do Edit Fill Series Column Linear Step Value = 1, OK.
Enter the rest of the Multi-Variable Data Headings and Formulas:


Enter to cell D34 Diff and enter to cell range D35:D51 into the cell D35 the formula w/o quotes "=C35-E35" and Edit Fill Down.
Create the Chart ofÂ "Multi-Variable Analysis of Demand Function Curve Into Pieces w/ Acceptable Percentage Difference < 3%"


Select the cell range B35:E51 and, using the Chart Wizard or Charts from the Ribbon, select Charts, All/Other, Scatter, Smoothed Line Scatter.

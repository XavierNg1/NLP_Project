Gather your tools.This extremely basic sundial is a great way to explain the concept with very little planning.
Find a sunny area to plant the stick.Look for a place that gets full sun exposure all day long.
Start at 7:00 a.m.If you want to complete the sundial in a single day, begin in the morning after the sun has fully risen.
Return to the stick every hour.Set an alarm or keep an eye on your watch so that you can update the dial at the top of every hour.
Continue this until process until dusk.

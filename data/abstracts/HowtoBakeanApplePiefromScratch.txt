Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC).
Make sure you have a clean, spacious counter top available for kneading and rolling out the dough.

,
Place the flour, salt, and butter in a large bowl.
Knead with floured hands until a large dough ball forms.
On a floured counter-top, begin to roll the dough out into a circle shape about 2 inches (5.1 cm) larger in diameter than the pie pan.
Slowly lift the flattened dough off the counter-top by wrapping it completely around the rolling pin.

,
Unroll the dough over the pan, being careful not to let it tear.
Cut off the overhanging edges.
Place the pie shell in the refrigerator.

,
Make the filling.
Roll out the remaining ball of dough on a floured surface, just like you did before.
Remove the pie shell and filling from the refrigerator.

,
Pour the filling into the pie shell, spreading it out with the back of a spoon.
Brush the edges of the pie shell with a beaten egg.

,
Lay the top crust over the pie.
Sprinkle milk over the top or brush the lattice with the egg wash.
Bake at 400ºF (200ºC) for 15 minutes.
Allow the pie to cool 45 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature before serving.

,
Finished.

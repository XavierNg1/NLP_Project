Peel the potatoes and then cut into even chunks.
Meanwhile, heat a splash of oil in a large pan and throw in the chopped onion and carrots.
Drain any excess fats/oils out of the pan.
Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas Mark 5 while you wait.
Once the mince is done simmering, add it evenly into a deep baking dish.
Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake the cottage pie for 15 - 20 minutes, or until the mashed potatoes are slightly golden brown.

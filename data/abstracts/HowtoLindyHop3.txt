Have the lead start by leading a rockstep, the exact same way as for the Charleston basic.
Starting with your outside foot (the one away from your partner), do a triple step.
On count five, take a step with your inside foot, and on count six take one with your outside foot.
On counts seven and eight, do another triple step, starting on your inside foot.
Repeat the step, do a different basic, or something else.

Prepare.
Immediately syringe yourself (L2 to syringe and X) and then switch to rations if this isn't a BBE or other elite emblem run.
Run straight forwards and up the stairs to the right ignoring all the Haven troopers.
If its your first run; use the M4 to attack both dolls, either is good.

,
If it's a return attempt; use your M4 on the Mantis doll (red doll) only.

,
Scope.
Eventually she will make Meryl attack you via the medium of cut scene.
A second cut scene should eventually begin where Meryl is forced to attempt to take her own life.
Eventually she will drop a doll, immediately drop your scope and run for the doll.
If it was your first run, proceed to take down the second doll, and then use the Mantis doll on Mantis, as previously explained (Hold L1, and shake).
Once her Armour falls another B&B sequence will ensue, kill or tranquilize her as necessary.

If you get to school by yourself. this step will be easy.
Bring some tape, a piece of plain white printer paper, and a sharpie/marker.
If you wanted to walk around freely or bring a friend along, then continue reading.
Make sure your friend is well educated on your plan, and that they won't snitch!,
Some of your classes will probably be far away from the bathroom you're hiding in; they would probably be extra classes, such as art or health.
When the end of the day comes around, brainstorm a way to get out of the building without being caught.

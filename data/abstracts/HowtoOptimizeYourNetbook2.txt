In Mozilla move all items from the bookmarks toolbar to the big empty space you have in the Menu bar.
Also for Mozilla install the Add-ons Search bar Autosizer, Tiny Menu and Toolbar Buttons.
Zoom in and out while viewing with Ctrl + scrolling the mouse wheel (or with the vertical area on the right side of the touchpad).

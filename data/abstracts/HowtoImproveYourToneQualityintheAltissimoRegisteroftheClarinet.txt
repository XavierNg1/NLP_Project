Know if you're ready to try to conquer the altissimo register.
Consider private lessons, if you aren't taking them already.
When you first try to play altissimo notes (which start with the C#6, or the first C# above the staff), just relax.
Try taking more mouthpiece in your mouth.
If you are still having trouble, consider investing in a new mouthpiece and/or ligature, different reeds, or even a new clarinet.
Keep practicing.

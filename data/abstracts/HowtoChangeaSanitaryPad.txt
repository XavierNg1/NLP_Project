Bring a fresh pad to the bathroom.
Pull down your pants or skirt and your underwear and sit or squat over the toilet.
Remove the pad by gripping a clean edge between your fingers and peeling it off your underwear.
Roll the pad so that the adhesive side is on the outside and the soiled part is on the inside.
Unwrap the new pad and use the wrapper to hold your old pad.
Throw out your pad in the trash--never, ever flush it down the toilet.
Make sure you're using the right pad.
Remove the paper strip on the back of the pad.
Press the pad into the middle of your underwear, making sure it is centered, and the glue is stuck firmly to the fabric.
Stand up, pull up your pants, and check the fit.
Wash your hands before leaving the bathroom.

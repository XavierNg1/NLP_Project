Wow him.
Don't cake on the makeup.
Start up a conversation.
Tease him.
Break the touch barrier but always remember to respect people's personal space.
Get close to his friends.
Find out things about him.
Support him.
Study together.
Test him.
Make sure the coast is clear.
Don't give up.
Balance out your life.
Be yourself.
If you think that he might like you, try to be a little more forward with him.
Send him a love letter.

Look at the finished trim job!,
Note the white/woody stalks and the newer/brown growth at the upper level.

If you are interested in propagating your cuttings, stay only to the top 60 cm (24") of your pruning, cutting just below and just above each node, then trimming any excess leaves you might have.

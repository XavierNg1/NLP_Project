No one can tell the meaning of a dream, all the time.
Look at the history of psyche and windows.
See if it could be an analogy for your life.
You can try being the people and symbols in your dream, but for many, doing this by oneself doesn't yield much richness, emotion, or insight.
If you prefer a less committed approach to understand your dreams, then simply tell your dreams to a trusted friend or write them in a journal.

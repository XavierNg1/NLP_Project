Devote your wake-up time to Christ, whether you work the first shift or the third shift.
Try to use the same spot (chair, room, etc.),
Start with just five minutes a day and then add on to that time gradually.
Include ACTS:

Adoration.
Try journaling what God says to you through the Scripture, as well as your prayer requests and His answers.
Feel free at any time to just sit in silence...here's where you can hear what God wants to say to you!

Use an outdoor table to do this method.
Hook up a garden hose and "flood" the area around the valve with water.
Flood the rest of the surface of the mattress with water.
Mark the leak with a permanent marker once you find the source.
Dry the mattress in direct sunlight or in the wind for an hour or two.

Experiment with Peter Capaldi's look.
Get the coat.
He wears a blue cardigan with his white dress shirt, however from the episode "Flatline" onwards, he started wearing a black waistcoat (only with his white dress shirt).
Get a dress shirt, in either white, navy blue or purple.
Add black or charcoal black dress pants.
Wear black boots.
He sometimes wore a long sleeve black jumper with holes in it, over what seemed to be a white undershirt.
You're now ready.

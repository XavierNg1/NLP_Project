Choose the shape and size of your calender.
Cut out 24 shapes of fabric for your calender.
Turn your first two sheets to where the right sides are in.Sew all the sides up except for the side that will be in the top.
Now that you have all of the sheets sewn and turned right sides out you need to sew them all together at the top.
Sew the first sheet to the front of the top under it so the rough edges are sealed.

Put a lump of brewer's yeast or sprinkle powdered yeast into a jar of warm water and sugar.
Dig a hole large enough for the jar to sit in up to its mouth.
Repeat every few feet.
Check daily and remove slugs and snails that have been attracted to the jar and dispose of them.
Renew the mixture regularly.

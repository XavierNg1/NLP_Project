Shampoo and condition with sulfate-free products.Sodium laureth sulfate and sodium lauryl sulfate are common ingredients in shampoos and conditioners, but sulfates can damage hair and cause frizz.
Use a deep conditioner after every shampoo.
Rinse out the conditioner with cold water.Cold water will smooth and close the hair cuticle, which helps to prevent frizz and adds extra shine.
Avoid terrycloth towels.Terrycloth fibers cause friction on hair strands, which creates frizz.
Allow your hair to air dry 90 percent of the way before blow drying.Blow drying wet hair can damage it and cause significant amount of frizz.

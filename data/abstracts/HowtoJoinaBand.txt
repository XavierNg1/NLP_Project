Be practiced and prepared.
Attend any "Open Jam" or "Open Mic Night" you can find.
Set up your own jam sessions.
Place flyers in local guitar and drum shops, record stores, and (if they allow it) bars or clubs that have live entertainment, indicating that you're looking for a band.
Use the Internet to your advantage.
Invite local musicians to join your band.
Ask around from time to time at the open jams to see if anyone is looking for band members.

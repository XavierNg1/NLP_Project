Decide between earbuds or headphones.
Remember that you get what you pay for.
Evaluate the headphones' sound isolation.
Investigate the frequency range.
Don't look for noise-canceling features unless you're willing to shell out the big bucks.
Test them out.
Look for the impedance of the headphones.
Finally, use your ears!

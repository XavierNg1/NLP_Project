Listen to the guest.Let the customer say everything they need to say.
Try to picture the problem as the customer explains it.For instance, a customer may say, “I was eating my soup and there were several little peas in it which were quite hard.” In your mind’s eye, envision the soup in question.
Clarify what the customer says.
Stay calm and show you’re concerned.
Apologize to the customer.
Act quickly when handling a complaint.When a customer has a complaint, no matter how serious, correcting it should take priority over anything else.
Solve the problem.Solutions take a variety of forms, each dependent on the specific situation.
Share information about the customer’s complaint with your teammates.For instance, if a customer says the soup is too salty, you should inform the cook who made the soup.
Thank the guest for bringing the issue to your attention.Many customers might be too considerate or too proud to complain about their experience.

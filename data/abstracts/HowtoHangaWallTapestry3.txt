Use this method to add a casing or rod pocket if your tapestry does not have one.
Obtain a strip of cloth that is slightly shorter than the width of the tapestry.
Hand sew the strip of cloth across the top back edge of the tapestry.
Insert a rod into the rod pocket or casing.
Make sure your tapestry hangs straight and even.

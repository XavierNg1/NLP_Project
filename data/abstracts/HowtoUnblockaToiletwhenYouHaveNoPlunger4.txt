Please take extreme care while handling caustic soda.
Do this at night; that way, hopefully nobody will need to use the toilet and you can leave the toilet to clear overnight.

Pour about 3 to 4 liters (0.8 to 1.1 US gal) of water in a plastic bucket.
The water will heat up during mixing and will generate fumes.
Once mixed, slowly pour the solution into an empty toilet bowl.
Again mix caustic soda and water as described above for the second time.
In the morning, pour a couple of buckets of hot steaming water into the toilet from about waist length.

Tell her she is beautiful.
Hold her hand, even if it's just for a second.
Kiss her on the forehead.
Leave her a sweet voicemail or text messages to wake up to.
Always tell her how much you love her.
When she is upset, hold her tight.
Recognize the small things.
Introduce her to family and friends as your girlfriend.
Play with her hair.
Pick her up, tickle her, and play-wrestle with her.
Sit and just talk to her.
When you miss her, let her know.
Let her rest in your arms.
If she's mad at you, comfort her.
Give her piggyback rides.
Bring her flowers for no reason.
Look her in the eyes and smile.

,
Let her take as many pictures of you as she wants.

,
Slow dance with her, even if there isn't any music playing.

,
Kiss her in the rain.

,
If you're in love with her, tell her.

,
Tell her she is unique.

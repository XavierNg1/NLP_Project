Get four people.
Each person should take a window.
After round four, open the door on the top right, and have someone else open the following door.
You should have the MP40 buy now.
Have someone else open the next door, and camp there (as long as there are other people there) until the last person opens the next door.
Until round nine, run around killing zombies with the stakeout.
At round nine, turn the power on, open the room in the middle, and get 5000 points ASAP.
When the dogs come again, use your pack-a-punched gun and stay with someone else.
It should be around round twelve now.

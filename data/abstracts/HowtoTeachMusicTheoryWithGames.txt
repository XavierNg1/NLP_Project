Allot five minutes at the end of the lesson as "game time".
Choose a very simple game first, that only teaches one concept at a time.
Try to pick a game that matches a concept that the student needs to work on from their practical work.
Make it short and sweet - a good game is a short game!,
Another idea is to have a "game of the week" that is in your studio for the whole week, and you can play it with students who need it.
Load up some music theory games.

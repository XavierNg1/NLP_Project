Consider what kind of exhaust you have.
,
Inspect the existing system.
Place cardboard under rear of vehicle where you will be working.
Remove the old system.
Now that the old system is gone, take a good look at your heater boxes.
Look at the flange surfaces for the heater boxes and the new exhaust system.While supporting the new exhaust in place, on the end opposite the tail pipe, put the first bolt, with washers, etc, through the exhaust flange, gasket – or two if necessary – and through the heater box flange and hand tighten.
On the opposite end of the system, behind the tail pipe, try to get the holes to line up.
Tighten everything up.
Check your work.
Reinspect everything a day later and then a week later.

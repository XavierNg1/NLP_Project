Start with damp or dry hair.
Comb out your hair and divide it into four equal sections.
Apply a small amount of curling gel to the first section.
Lift the section of hair and start twisting it from the root.
Continue to twist the section around itself, winding it in a coil around the root.
Secure the coil with a few bobby pins.
Allow the curls to set for at least one hour.
Unwind the coils.
Finish with a little more gel.

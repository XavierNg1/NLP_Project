Create a marinade for the swordfish steaks, as a marinade adds flavor and keeps the swordfish moist and tender.
Marinade the swordfish steaks in a plastic or glass bowl in your refrigerator for at least 4 hours.
Forego the marinade and use simple seasonings such as salt and pepper or fresh rosemary if you prefer a plainer swordfish steak.
Grill the swordfish steaks on a preheated grill.
Flip the swordfish steaks over every few minutes so the steak cooks evenly, cooking until the fish is done and flakes easily with a fork.
Serve the grilled swordfish on a serving platter with your choice of garnish.

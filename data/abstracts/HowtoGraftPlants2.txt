Construct a healing chamber in advance.
Add pans of water to the chamber and monitor the environment.
Choose plants that are 2–5 inches (5–13cm) tall and have equal diameters.
Cut each plant in half at a 45º angle.
Join the two plants together with a grafting clip.
Move the new hybrid plant to a humid, dark environment immediately.
Gradually return the plant to more sunlight.
After two weeks, return surviving plants to normal growing conditions.
Plant the hybrid with the graft clip well above the soil.

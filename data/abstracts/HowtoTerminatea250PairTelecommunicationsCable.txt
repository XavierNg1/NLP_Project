Install the BIX Mount - Note: The BIX Mount must be installed on a 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) plywood backboard that has been treated with a fire retardant product or that has been covered with a fire retardant paint.





Install the BIX Distribution Rings - Fasten one ring to the top right corner and one ring to the bottom right corner of the mount.





Mount the 250-pair Cable - Fasten the cable to the BIX mount with nylon tie wraps.

Strip the cable - The 250-pair cable will have ten (10) Secondary bundles of 25-pairs (50-conductors).





Fasten each 25-pair bundle - While referring to the colour codes in Figure 5, fasten each 25-pair bundle to a BIX1A connector.





Seat the conductors - Each conductor will have its own painted colour code.
Terminate the conductors - The BIX Connecting tool is a device that will cut / trim each conductor to the required length and press each conductor into the BIX1A connector.





Rotate the BIX Connectors - Each BIX1A connector must now be rotated so that the terminated 25-pair bundles are on the inside of the BIX10A mount.

Label the BIX10A mount - It is necessary in structured cabling to identify each connection and conductor.
Document - All telecommunications cabling should be accurately documented and referenced in a spreadsheet form.

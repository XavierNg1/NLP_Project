Before you begin, plan your direct mail package.
Spend a lot of time on the envelope, giving consumers a reason to open it and learn more about your offer.
Create a swipe file of direct marketing pieces that youâ€™ve personally received and opened.
Manage your budget carefully, as large mail campaigns can have a high cost and negatively impact your return on investment.
Value-added postcards can help mail get attention.
Be sure to have a compelling reason for people to visit your Web site and a method for tracking results.
Create a clear call to action.

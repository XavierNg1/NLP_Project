Visit your local church.
Some Christian communities (Catholic and others) hold Passion Plays, which you might like to attend, or perhaps, even participate, or organize.
Alternatively, some people fast on Good Friday.
At 3:00 PM, if you don't go to Mass, stop what you are doing.and pray, if possible.
Throughout the day, reflect on the death of Jesus.

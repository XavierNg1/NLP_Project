You should know what your voice range is (baritone, tenor, contralto, mezzo soprano, etc).
Warm up.
When you first start learning, you're going to be making a lot of dodgy noises.
Use your diaphragm correctly!,
When you are first learning to scream and do not know how to use your diaphragm, flex your abdominals, kind of like you're about to take a punch.
All you have to do from there, is repeatedly (over the course of many weeks), raise and lower pitch.
The more air you push out, the higher in pitch your screams will be.
It is MOST likely that it will hurt at first, but after a while you will learn how to do this correctly.
To attain a different pitch use your diaphragm, tongue position and the shape of your mouth... lows for eg - lower your tongue open your mouth wide.
For future reference, in most of the music that you might be trying to imitate, they use distortion effects in the studio or auto tune to make a deeper and fuller pitch.

It's just as bad for you as exhale screaming (if done improperly).

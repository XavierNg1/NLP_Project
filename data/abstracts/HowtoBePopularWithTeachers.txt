Try to help in the flow of the class.
If you meet teachers a lot during school hours, or on the streets, grab the opportunity.
It's the small things that get noticed.
Perfect your small but considerate gestures.
Be over-polite.
There might be problems in your friend group if you start being "friendly" to teachers.

Root forsythia after the bush has finished blooming and all of its flowers have fallen off.
Grow forsythia in well-drained, acidic soil and lots of shade.
Prepare your cuttings before you plant them to help them root properly.
Try an alternative method for rooting clippings by bending a branch down from an existing bush, covering the first 6 inches (15.2 cm) of the branch with soil and mulch, and using a brick or rock to weigh it down.
Make sure clippings have plenty of shade when rooting and aren’t exposed to lots of direct sunlight.

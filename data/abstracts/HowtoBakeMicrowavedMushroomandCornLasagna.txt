Once it is uncovered, you will find it nicely saucy in texture.
Heat the butter in a shallow pan.
Once it is melted, take it off the flame and place onto your kitchen slab or a heat-safe board.
Return to the heat.

Cook the lasagna sheets if they're not already instant.
Take a deep vessel and fill it three fourths of the way with water.
Add 5 sheets of lasagna pasta from the pack.
Strain the water.
Grate a sufficient sized block of cheese to pamper your taste buds.

Grease the whole dish with butter.

,
Lay the red sauce evenly on the base of the dish.
Spread and cover the whole sheet of lasagna as well as all gaps with the remaining white sauce.
Cook.

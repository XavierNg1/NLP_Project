While point-shooting sounds like a great idea (to be able to naturally point at a target), it is (for 99% of people) a very bad idea.
The other option is called "flash sighting".
Studies in police departments which train with flash sighting against departments who teach point-shooting have shown staggering results.
Most people can use that one-tenth of a second to get that guaranteed hit instead of just putting a bunch of holes in the walls behind the bad guy.
Ultimately the "point of the gun" (mentioned in choosing a good sidearm) is still important as it will decrease the amount of time required to flash sight, but since you are still using the sights it is less important.

Alternatively, most real life threat armed encounters occur at less than 21 feet (6.4Â m), and the accepted hit rate in the shooting community is < 20%.

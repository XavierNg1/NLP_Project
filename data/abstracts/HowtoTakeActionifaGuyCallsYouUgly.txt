If he's teasing you, a friendly poke and a joke in return will be fine.
If you start wondering if the guy was actually kidding, take a look at yourself, especially if this isn't the first time someone has said this.
Don't let it ruin your life.
If it's a boyfriend, find someone who isn't a jerk.

Remember that mature adults don't generally going around calling each other ugly.
Use a comeback if you want to.

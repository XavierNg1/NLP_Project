Calm down first.
Ask yourself why you feel so badly that you can see no other alternative but to make it into a final choice.
Ask yourself if what you really want is to have a sense of power or control over a situation.
Think clearly and plan.
Write down your ultimatum and stick it under your pillow.
Dial a friend.
Exercise.
Let go.

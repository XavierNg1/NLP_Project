Discover the true motivation behind your competitive behavior.
Look into yourself to contemplate what it is that truly drives you and gives you a sense of purpose in life.
Be sensitive to the feelings and rights of others.
Avoid slander and discrediting any other person in order to further your own ends or gains.
Be proud of the accomplishments of others, not threatened.
Use your own confidence and hard work to achieve your aims.
Realize that lying, scheming or deliberately planning events to work in your favor are not healthy competitive approaches but are simply forms of work and life sabotage.
Give yourself enough time and space to achieve your aims.
Be realistic.

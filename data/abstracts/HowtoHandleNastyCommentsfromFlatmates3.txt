Ask the person you're having conflict with if you can set aside some time in the next few days to talk.
When it comes time for the conversation, be willing to listen as much as you want to be heard.
Find out what they want in their home.
If they admit that something you have done has triggered them to act in this way, then get to the root of that.
If they don't agree to have a talk, ask why not.
Set boundaries clearly with an unwilling flatmate.
Document what happens.
Consider moving out.

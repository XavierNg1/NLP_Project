First things first.
Once you've received your R4i Gold card, and have your micro sd card in hand, head over to the official website for the r4i gold.
Download the firmware to your PC, and make sure to note where you have saved the file.
Download a free / shareware version of a compression software.
Double click on the firmware .rar file and it will open for you're in the compression software.
The NES emulator for the Nintendo 3DS is called NesDS.
Once you have both your firmware downloaded, as well as the NesDS emulator, it's time to put it all on your micro sd card.
Now it's time to put the firmware on to the micro sd card.
Your next step is to do the same with NesDS.
Once your firmware, NesDS and your games are on the micro SD card, it's time to take the micro SD card out of the USB Reader and plug it into your R4i Gold card.
Plug the R4i Gold into your Nintendo 3DS just as you would any regular 3DS game card.
This is your final step before you're playing your favorite NES games on your Nintendo 3DS.

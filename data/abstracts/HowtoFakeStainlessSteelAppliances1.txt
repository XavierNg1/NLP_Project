Buy some stainless steel contact paper.
Find a friend or family member willing to help you with this project.
Clean and dry the surface you wish to cover.
Measure the length of surface you wish to cover, add 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters), then cut your contact paper accordingly.If your contact paper has a grid on the back, use that as a guide, otherwise, use a straight edge.
Starting from the top, peel the backing down by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters).You will be working one small section at a time.
Place the contact paper against your appliance, making sure that the top edges align.
Run the edge of a credit card across the surface of the contact paper, making sure to smooth out any air bubbles.
Unpeel the contact paper a few more inches, and smooth it down again.
Flatten the side edges down, if needed.
Trim any excess away with a craft blade, if needed.Unless your measurements were precise to the last millimeter, you may end up having some excess contact paper hanging over the edges.

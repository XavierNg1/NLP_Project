Decide how big the blanket box will be.
,
Decide on the material - you can use anything from plywood up to an oak or maple veneer.
Plywood is inexpensive and relatively easy to work with; MDF is smooth and easy to cut, however, it can be easily dented; laminate, which is fiberboard covered with a layer of plastic impregnated paper and is very strong and durable, comes in many colors.
If you have access to a table saw, you'll want to mitre cut the edges at a 45 degree angle to make a nice smooth seam.
Cut the boards to the desired sizes.

,
Put a bead of wood glue on the joints.

,
Tack the boards together with small wood nails.
Create the frame of the box.
Fill the frame with boards.
Allow the glue to set.
Create the frame for the lid.
Paint the box, apply primer then coat it with paint.
Attach the lid to the blanket box with a hinge or hinges (depending on the size of the box).
If desired, you can add lid closers and a catch to the outside.

,
Your blanket box is now ready to use.

Gather the materials needed to build an “on-the-ground” tumbling composter.
Drill two holes into the lid and bottom of your container using a 7/8” drill bit.
Create aeration holes all over your container.
Drill two holes straight through each end of your two metal or aluminum pipes using a 1/4" metal drill bit.
Drill two additional holes into each pipe, and then thread your rod through those holes.
Secure the pipe and rod structure to your container.
Fill your tumbling composter with composting ingredients and secure the lid.
Test the security of your lid by rolling your new tumbling composter across the ground.

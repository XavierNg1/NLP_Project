Find out when it’s going to fail before it fails.
Listen for strange noises: Sometimes hearing strange grinding and thrashing noises means your drive is beyond repair—for instance, if you’ve had a head crash, it very often is.
Watch for disappearing data and disk errors: Your computer won’t let you save a document?,
Your computer stops recognizing your drive: This may seem obvious, but if your computer no longer recognizes your drive chances are there’s a problem with it, not the computer.
Computer Crashes: Does your computer regularly blue-screen or suddenly reboot?,
Really Slow Access Times: It shouldn’t take half an hour to open a folder in Windows Explorer, or two hours to empty the trash.
Sound is a great indicator.
If your computer crashes or can't find a file that was there not long ago it can mean that your hard-drive is on its way out, but it could also be that there is a simple file-system error in the disks' formatting.
chkdsk will check and repair the file-system structure on disk C: (Plus check and repair any data-file errors if the /r parameter is used.).

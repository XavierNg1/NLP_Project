Learn about Pot Melt.
Get started.
Create and make the opening in the base of the pot larger with a hammer and chisel or even a heavy duty screwdriver.
Put the glass into the pot.
Do NOT kilnwash the pot prior to the melt, this runs the risk of kilnwash particles in the resultant melt.
Coat a tray such as the base of the terracotta pot, a kiln shelf or a square salad plate mold in 3 coats of kilnwash.
Place the pot in the center of the kiln, making certain that the glass doesn't reach the thermocouple.
Notice that with a round hole, the molten glass dribbles out in a spiral or circular pattern, and with a hole of rectangular shape, the dribbled glass folds on itself.

Make a ballerina paper doll, a stock figure.
Place your figure on the watercolor paper and lightly trace around it in pencil.

,
Sketch out the costume.
Activate the colors in your paintbox by putting a little water on each pad of color.
To paint the skirt to appear as transparent layers of netting, mix a puddle of color with enough water to dilute the paint, but to keep the integrity of the color.
Mix a second puddle, this time orange.
Make a fitted bodice, the better for the ballerina's partner to lift her for the gazelle-like leaps.
When the whole painting is dry paint from the waistline to the hem a few strokes of either orange or pink to create the illusion that the skirt is gathered at the waist.
Don't forget her slippers, ribbon laces and headpiece.
Allow your painting to dry.
Admire your work of art.

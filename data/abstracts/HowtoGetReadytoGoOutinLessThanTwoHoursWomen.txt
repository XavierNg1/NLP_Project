Get dressed - Always have a L.B.D.
Match your shoes - Due to the pre-preparation of the L.B.D.
Apply your makeup - As most girls do, you’ll immediately look in the mirror and go... ‘Yuck!’ Well that’s why companies such as Revlon, Cover Girl and M.A.C were created.
Fix your hair - This part is every girl's worst nightmare.
Cover your legs - Don’t forget the legs!,
Choose a bag - By now you have covered outfit, shoes, face, hair and legs.
Finished.

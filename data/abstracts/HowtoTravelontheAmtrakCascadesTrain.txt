Look at schedules.
Look at ticket prices.
Make a reservation.
Effective July 30, 2012, Amtrak now uses all-electronic tickets for travel.
On the day of your trip, get to the train station at least 30 minutes prior to your train's scheduled departure.
In the major stations, like Portland and Seattle, your e-ticket will be scanned before you board the train, and you will be given a seat assignment.
Board the train.
Get ready to leave.
Walk towards the station building and wait on the platform.
Enter the station and pick up any checked baggage or take care of any other business.

Get your grandparents a gift.
Spend the day with them.
Ask them questions about their lives.
Talk about all the things you used to do, or if they are well enough, go out and do something you used to do with them when you were a kid, like going to the museum, painting, or fishing.

,
Talk about memories they had with their grandparents, or about what your parents were like (you might dig up some embarrassing stories about them that you can tell at the dinner table)!

,
Tell them about yourself.
Tell them that you love them -and will always.

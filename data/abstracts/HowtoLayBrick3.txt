Place down several courses on each end of the wall.
Stagger the bricks on each course by starting with a half or turned brick.
Keep the height of the brick the same using a spirit or carpenter's level, and keep the end joints (head joints) equal as you build up.
Strike the head and bed joints with a "jointer" or "joint striker" when the mortar has begun to set.
Brush the face of the brick with a "foxtail" brush to wipe away excess mortar and finish smoothing the joint.
Continue laying the brick until you are level with the leads you laid up, then begin at the ends or corners laying either in another direction, or straight up with another lead.

Find two different sized cans.
Clean the cans well and peel off any labels.
Fill the larger can with some water, then place smaller can inside of it.
Fill the smaller can with enough rocks until the rim is level with the larger can's rim.
Tape the rims of the cans together so that the smaller can stays in the center.Cut four equal-sized pieces of tape, and stick them to the top, bottom, and sides of the small can's rim.
Consider adding some greenery.
Check the water level, then pour or add more water if needed.
Freeze the water.
Take the ice luminary out of the mold.
Use the luminary with flameless candles.

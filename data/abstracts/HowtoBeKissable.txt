Have fresh breath.
Make sure that your lips are well moisturized.
Do NOT lick your lips.
Don't forget to look after your skin.
Make plenty of eye contact.
Being comfortable makes you appear more relaxed and therefore more kissable.
Make sure you don't stare at your (future) partner's lips.
Ensure your mouth isn't carrying a river of fluid!,
Smile and relax.

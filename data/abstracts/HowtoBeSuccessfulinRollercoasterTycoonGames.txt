Pick a scenario where you have to build your theme park from scratch.
Click the money amount on the bottom left and increase your loan as much as needed to build enough rides.
Click the build icon.
When your entrance area looks full, build something bigger.
Now that you have the entrance filled up, it's time to move to the big area of the park.
Now, again, pick "Gentle Rides" and build a car ride not too far from the roller coaster.
If it is past April in your game, click the build icon, choose "Water Rides," and build whatever ride they have.
Now it's time to move on to the pathways.
Now that you have a basic sketch of your park, it's time to move on to even bigger rides.
Add the other attractions that keep your guests going.
Now, click on "landscaping/decorations" icon and choose "path decorations".
Now that your park looks more like an actual park, it's time to go into business.
Now just sit back and watch your park population grow.
Click the money again and choose the very last tab.
Now relax for a minute and look at the amount of money.

Listen to as many recordings as you can find.
Memorize the piece.
Notice that the opening section is repetitious.
Be aware of when the orchestra has the melody and when you have the melody.
Understand that Tchaikovsky was a master of harmonics.
Practice the octave passages carefully.
Perfect the prestissimo in the second movement by using a metronome and tearing each measure apart.
Notice that in the third movement it is important for the grace notes to be heard in the right hand.
Take care about the rhythm in the ending passage (the measures where the piano starts with the 8th rest).

Acquire a pair of white, or off white canvas shoes.
You will need a wide variety of markers--Sharpies work very well for this.
It is very helpful to think of a theme.
Draw your first picture.
Using a thick marker in a vibrant color, outline the shoelace holes.
Repeat outlining all of the objects.
Continue this until the entire face of the shoe is filled.
Finished.

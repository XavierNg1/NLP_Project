Draw your pattern.
Pin two layers of cloth together and cut two of these pieces from your heavy cloth.

,
Sew the two pieces together along their seam line (1/4 inch from the outside edge), starting the rounded end of one piece in the middle of the "waist" of the other piece and with right sides facing together as shown.

,
Leave an inch or so of opening for turning right side out and stuffing.
Clip the seam allowances every quarter inch or so up to the stitch line to allow the seam to lay smooth when turned, being careful to clip up to the line without actually cutting the seam.
,
Turn the ball “right side” out and stuff it to the level of firmness you like.
,
Blind stitch the opening closed.





,
Voila!

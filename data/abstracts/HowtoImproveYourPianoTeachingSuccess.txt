First define what is good teaching


Good teaching has a clear focus, with definite goals based on musical principles.
Agree overall goals so that you can decide learning objectives


Discuss and agree individual goals with each student; not all students want the same outcome - some are ambitious, some play 'just for fun'.
Know how to assess whether learning objectives are being achieved


We will know if we have succeeded in teaching the correct time value of dotted rhythms in a Kabalevsky piece, for example, if the student plays accurately now and remembers the timing in the next lesson.

Take into account your students' preferred learning styles


Different students have preferred learning styles and we should know what these are so that we can both teach that student most effectively.
Be a creative teacher


Begin teaching a piece by focusing on an aspect of it that resonates with the individual student's preferred learning style, for instance exploring chord shapes with kinaesthetic learners.
Get to know your students


Getting to know each student well enough to be attuned to their individual learning styles can be fascinating and rewarding, helping to make lessons more enjoyable and learning easier.
Smile!,
Keep learning!

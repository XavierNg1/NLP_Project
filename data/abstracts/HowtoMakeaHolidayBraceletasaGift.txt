Choose a theme.
Choose colours.
Look for beads.
Visualize.
Prepare a little workspace where you will start.
Then, start with planning:


Your bracelet should be balanced: Do not have huge beads on one side, and small beads on another, because that is not balanced and will most likely look bad.
Start the bracelet.
Be patient.
Start.
Done!

Gather the necessary materials.
Soak your whetstones in water until no air bubbles pop up anymore.
Place the stone on a non-slip service to prevent any dangerous issues.
Begin with the course grit side of the stone, the one with the lower number.
Tilt the knife so that the blade makes a roughly 22-degree angle with the stone.
Hold the knife with the handle in your dominant hand so that your index finger is on the edge of the blade, almost where it meets the stone.
Spread your non-dominant hand fingers on the back of the blade itself, applying even pressure across the whole blade down into the stone.
Keeping the angle of the knife consistent throughout, push the blade evenly across the whetstone.
Splash the whetstone with water every few minutes to keep it wet.
Repeat as many times as necessary, moving your fingers across the blade to sharpen the whole thing.
Flip the blade over and repeat with the other side, making the same number of passes.
Switch to the finer grit stone and alternate sharpening each side.
"Cut" a wooden cutting board with the knife to even out the cutting surface.
Hone the blade.

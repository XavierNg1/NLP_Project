If youâ€™re using a gas grill, preheat it.
Peel the aubergine, if desired, and cut into 1/2-inch slices.
Season as desired with herbs, salt, and ground black pepper.
Line the grill with foil or place it directly onto the rack.
Grill for about 8 minutes or until crispy and tender, turning occasionally.

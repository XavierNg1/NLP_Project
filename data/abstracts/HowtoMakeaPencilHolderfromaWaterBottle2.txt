Cut down 7 water bottles, with one of them being taller than the rest.
Decorate the bottles.
Arrange the shorter bottles around the taller one.All shorter bottles should be touching the taller one.
Pull out the first bottle and draw a vertical line of hot glue down the side.
Quickly replace the bottle, and press it gently against the taller bottle.
Wrap a piece of ribbon or colorful tape around the middle of the bottle bundle.
Consider decorating the caddy further.

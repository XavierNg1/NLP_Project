Learn or recall from "Elements", Book II, Proposition 4, that "If a straight line be cut at random, the square on the whole is equal to the squares on the segments and twice the rectangle contained by the segments.",
Learn or recall that, per the above diagram, if segment AC = x and segment CB = y, that (x+y)^2 also equals x^2 + y^2 + 2xy.
Call the Area of the Whole square AE equal to 1 or 100% Probability.

,
Guesstimate from the random cut in the diagram that it occurred at a value of .70 of length AB.

,
Calculate from your guesstimate what a dart's chance's of landing in each square are, or where the next robbery will be, i.e.
It's important to remember that Euclid solved this about 2.300 years ago!,

Rugby shirt
Cable-knit vests and sweaters (traditional cricket sweaters)
A jacket or blazer (navy blue is a staple; try seersucker or madras plaid in summer, tweed or corduroy in winter)
Chino pants-could have cuffs
Khaki pants.
Wear preppy shoes and accessories like these:


Pearl necklaces and earrings are a must, as well as diamond jewelry (make sure it's small, not fake-looking, and doesn't look too trashy or tacky)
Most preps wear their mother's, grandmother's, or aunt's old diamond and pearl jewelry, as an "old money" thing.
Stand up to others.

Choose an Indonesian sarong.
Step into the sarong.
Lift the top of the sarong up to your waist, and adjust it if necessary.
Use your right hand to hold the excess fabric away from your body.
Place your left hand across your right hip to keep the sarong snug.
Fold the sarong across your tummy towards your left hip.
Once the sarong is folded tightly, tuck the corner behind the waist band above your left hip.

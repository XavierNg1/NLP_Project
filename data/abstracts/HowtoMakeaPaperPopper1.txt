Use an 8 .5 in (21.5 cm) by 11 in (28 cm) sheet of printer paper.
Fold the bottom fourth of your paper up.
Fold another 2.5 inches (64 mm) of the paper up.
Flip your paper over so you don’t see the fold lines.
Grab the popper at the back tip of the folded bar on the top of your paper.
Make sure you’re not pinching any of the unfolded portions of the paper.
Snap the popper down.

Check if your rabbit is pregnant.
Expect the pregnancy of your doe to run for 31 to 33 days.It is possible that a doe with a smaller litter (say four kits or less) will have a slightly longer pregnancy than a doe with a litter that is larger than four.
Provide proper and complete nutrition for your doe during pregnancy.
Provide your doe with a nest box.
Be aware of the possible problems associated with a rabbit pregnancy.
Know what to expect at the birth (kindling).
Once all kits are born, check to see if everything is fine.
Take care of the kits and the doe together.
Find suitable homes for the kits.

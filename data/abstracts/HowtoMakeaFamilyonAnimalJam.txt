Decide whether you want a family of different animals or a family of just one type of animal.
Set up your den, so it is suitable for your family to live in.
Go to the pillow room.
Take them home.
Make sure that you don't boss your children around and be super strict.
Put up safety gates with fences if you have a baby under four.
To keep your family happy, go on little outings, such as the beach (Crystal Sands), the park (Lost Temple of Zios), or just simple grocery shopping (Jam Mart Clothing).
Remember to look after your pet, not just the kids.
Have fun with your new found family!

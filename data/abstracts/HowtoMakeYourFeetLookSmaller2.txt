Wear heeled boots.
Hide your toes.
Wear sandals with wider straps.
Gravitate toward shoes with dark colors.
Dress up your shoes.While you might think that accents and embellishments draw unwanted attention to a large foot, interesting details can actually provide a focal point for the eye to fixate on, thereby distracting it from the otherwise obvious length of the foot.

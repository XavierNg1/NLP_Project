Make a checklist of every item you plan to take on your trip.
Plan your outfits ahead of time to avoid over-packing.

If you will be going through customs, check your luggage prior to packing.
Place heavy items at the bottom of your bag, especially if it is an upright model.
Pack clothing using the time-honored "roll" technique.

Place breakable items, like jewelry or glass, wrapped in socks and tucked into shoes inside your luggage.
Buy wide clip rings.
Bring snacks in case you get hungry.
Bring entertainment in case you get bored.
Remember that trips are meant for fun and rest, not stress!

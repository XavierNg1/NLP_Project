Eat cheese at room temperature to help bring out the flavors and textures.About an hour before you plan on serving or eating the cheese, take it out of the fridge, but keep it in its wrapper so that it doesn't dry out.Keep in mind that in warmer climates, the cheese will reach room temperature sooner.
Peel or cut the rind off of hard cheeses.
Don't be afraid to eat the rind from soft, creamy cheeses.
Consider sniffing the cheese discretely before you eat it.
Use bread and crackers sparingly, and mostly as a palate cleanser.
Eat cheese from mildest to strongest if it is served on a platter.

Ensure your veggies are fresh.
Choose organic when possible.Organic vegetables are grown without pesticides and harmful chemicals that can hurt your bunny.
Keep the calcium content to a minimum.A high-calcium diet can cause bladder stones, urinary tract issues, kidney stones, and other digestive problems in bunnies.Greens that are high in calcium like kale, mustard greens, and collard greens should be fed sparingly to your rabbit.
Look out for greens with high levels of oxalic acid.Oxalic acid can be consumed by rabbits in small amounts, but in high levels it can be toxic.
Avoid iceberg lettuce.
Know your rabbit’s likes and dislikes.
Wait until your rabbit is old enough to eat greens.
Feed your rabbit grass hay.
Decide what volume of greens your rabbit should eat.
Wash your veggies.Vegetables often ship with pesticides coated on them.
Introduce fresh greens slowly.Don’t introduce a variety of new greens to your rabbit’s diet all at once.
Serve your rabbit’s greens wet.
Feed half the greens in the morning and the other half in the evening.
Look for potential problems.
Check your rabbit’s urine after feeding a new green.
Try to feed a variety of greens.Like people, rabbits will tire quickly of eating the same thing all the time.
Remove uneaten veggies.At the end of the day, remove any greens your rabbit did not eat.

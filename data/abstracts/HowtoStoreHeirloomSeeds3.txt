Save plenty of seeds.As a general rule, you should save seeds for as many plants as possible to produce an adequate harvest the following year.
Dry seeds further using silica gel.If you plan on storing your heirloom seeds for more than one season, you should consider drying them out even more than usual.
Transfer the dried seeds to an airtight container.
Sprinkle the inside of the containers with diatomaceous earth.
Mark the date on the container.
Freeze the seeds.While this may seem counter-intuitive, rather than hurting the seeds, freezing them actually keeps them cool and minimizes the amount of humidity.
Store seeds of different varieties separately.
Thaw the seeds out before use.

Place the drones of the bagpipes on your left shoulder, with the bag under your arm.
When there is almost enough air to sound the reeds, strike the bag with your right hand.
The bag should now be under your arm with the pipes sounding.
When you need to take a breath, squeeze the bag with your left arm and keep that pressure on when you stop blowing, then take a breath.
Keep practicing.

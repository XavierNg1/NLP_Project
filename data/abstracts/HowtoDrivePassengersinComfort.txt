If you have a choice of vehicles, choose a vehicle that does not ride high off the ground and is comfort- but not performance-oriented.
Keep the car ready with a few simple things the passengers might want.
Avoid sudden movements.
Avoid uneven movement.
Find a smooth road surface.
Avoid going faster than the flow of traffic overall.
On a long trip, take a break at least every two or three hours or so, before one becomes strongly needed.

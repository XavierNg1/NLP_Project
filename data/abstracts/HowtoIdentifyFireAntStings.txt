Recognize the appearance and most likely location of fire ants.
Be aware of the symptoms.There are local symptoms (localized to the area of the bite), as well as more systemic (full body) symptoms in some people who are susceptible to allergic reactions.
Watch out for signs of an allergic reaction.
Call the Poison Control Center or Emergency Medical Services.If you suspect that you have a fire ant sting, it is always important to get professional advice on how best to proceed.
Treat mild fire ant stings with home remedies.If you have seen a medical professional and ruled out a serious reaction to your fire ant sting, you can proceed to treatment via home remedies.
Take an oral anti-histamine.Another option to control itchiness is to take an oral anti-histamine such as Benadryl, which is particularly good for treating a sting or reaction to a sting.
Use a topical corticosteroid cream.You can purchase 1% hydrocortisone cream at your local pharmacy or drugstore, and apply this over the area of the bite.
Use an EpiPen and go to the hospital for severe allergic reactions.As previously mentioned, severe allergic reactions can be life-threatening if not handled immediately.
Understand that your risk of severe allergic reaction increases after one bite.If you have been stung once, you should carry an EpiPen with you in the future in case you ever get stung again.
Take comfort in knowing that the vast majority of people recover well.In less serious cases, the sting should feel better within a few hours to a few days.

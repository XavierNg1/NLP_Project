Adjust the height of the tube so it reaches the height of your flaring anvil.
Drop a few drops of brake fluid into the line and on the top of the anvil.
Insert the rod of the anvil into the brake tube.
Grab the yoke, E-shaped flaring tool with an adjustable conical point in the center, and clamp it to the flaring base.
Line up the flaring cone so that it press down squarely into the anvil.
Tighten the flaring cone, boring into the anvil, until the anvil is flush with the base.
Without moving the yoke, bore the flaring cone directly into your tube until it is flush.
Spray down the finished lines with brake cleaner and compressed air to remove any metal shavings or dust.
Remove the line from the flaring tool, then install the brake lines like normal.

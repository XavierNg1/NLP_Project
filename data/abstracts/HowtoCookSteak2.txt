For best results, use hardwood coal.
Arrange the all the hot coals on one half of the grill.
Start the steak on the cool side of the grill, where no coals are resting.
Flip often to begin developing a crust on each side.
Use a thermometer to test for doneness.
Alternately, use the the finger test to help approximate doneness.The finger test involves touching the fleshy part of your palm underneath your thumb to approximate the doneness of a piece of meat.
Once the meat is about 15° F below your ideal temperature, sear it quickly on both sides to develop color.
Take your steak off the grill about 5° F before it reaches your ideal temperature.
Season with pepper and let the steak rest for at least five minutes.
Enjoy.

Choose your containers with an understanding that big amaryllis bulbs can develop very large, heavy flowers.
Plant bulbs in a nutritious potting compost that have abundant organic material and a good drainage.
After the initial watering, wait to add more moisture until after you see stem and/or leaf growth to prevent overwatering.
Apply fertilizer when the time is right.
Enjoy your flowering containers and snip a stem here or there for use in a vase.

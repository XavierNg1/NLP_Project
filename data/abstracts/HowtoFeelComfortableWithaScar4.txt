Start with scar treatment immediately after the wound has healed.The first six months of a scarâ€™s healing are the most important for determining how well it will heal over the long term.
Apply silicone gel.
Massage the scar gently.
Apply a moisturizing cream.If the skin around a wound produces excess collagen -- a naturally occurring protein -- your scar will be raised, making your skin uneven.
Use sunblock.

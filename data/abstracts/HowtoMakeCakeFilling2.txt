For this decadent icing, you will need:


1 cup of chocolate, roughly chopped
1 cup of heavy cream
2 tbsp of butter

,
Place your chocolate in a heat-proof bowl and set it aside.
Bring the cream to a simmer.
After 5 minutes, use either a wooden spoon or spatula to mix the ganache.
The ganache should still be a little warm, so stir in the butter.
If you want to use your ganache as it is now, feel free to do it.

Think about of how big your army should be and how much resources you want to spend.
Build more than 1 Barrack.
Build enough musketeers.
Be sure your army has, at the least, has these personnel and supplies.
If you attack, save the cannons.
When the enemy starts to attack your cannons with his cavalry, try to kill them with your pike men and musketeers as fast as you can.

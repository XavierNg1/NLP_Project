Gather your materials.
Learn about what you will be doing.
Make the medium.
Attach a wire to both the item you want to plate, and the energy source.

,
Find the object you want to electroplate in (a half of a gallon jug of milk that is rinsed works well) and add about half of a liter of the acid (preferably vinegar) to it.

,
Add about 10 grams of salt in and stir.

,Repeat this until you can't dissolve any more salt, which is when you see salt at the bottom that doesn't dissolve after you stir for a while

,
Attach the wires with the metallic objects to the battery.
Put the metallic objects into the acid/salt solution.
Watch to make sure that nothing wrong happens.

,
Let this sit for about 5 minutes or until desired thickness is achieved.

,
Disconnect the wires at the battery, and remove your objects you just have electroplated.

,
Let the items sit on a towel or paper towel for about fifteen minutes, then use your fingers to remove the excess metal from the object you plated.

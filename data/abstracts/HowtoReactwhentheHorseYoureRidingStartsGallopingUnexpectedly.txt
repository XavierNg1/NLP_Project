Try to stop him.
If the horse does not slow down after pulling on the reins, keep your heels down and use one rein to pull your horse into a tight circle.
If you have a whip, use it gently but firmly on their neck to get their attention.
If he does slow down again, don't dismount.
Stay calm.
If you think you're in trouble and your horse won't listen to any cues (especially on trails), assume a safety seat.
Situation 1: other people in the arena:;
,
This step is the most important step because it keeps everybody in the arena safe.
Ask people to walk or halt so that your horse can see that everyone except him is walking of stopped.
Sit back in your seat and make your bottom the heaviest thing on you so you're not coming to your horse and he's coming to you.
With your reins if you do a pull and release it with be more effective because it annoys him so much he is not going to gallop off with you pulling on his mouth.

,
Pull him in a tight circle.
Situation number 2: jumps in the arena:

,Do everything from situation one

,
Let him/her over the jump, and make sure to do 2 point.
Have fun, but remember these safety steps!

,
To stop the problem immediately, take one rein and pull it to your thigh, which gets the hind end over.

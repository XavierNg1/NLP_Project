Recon can be unlocked by completing a series of 7 achievements dubbed Vidmasters, 4 in Halo 3 and 3 in Halo 3: ODST.
Vidmaster Challenge: Lightswitch : This achievement is probably the easiest, it requires you to get 50 EXP in any playlist.
Vidmaster Challenge: 7 on 7 : This is one weird achievement!,
Vidmaster Challenge: Annual : Now it gets complicated, and hard.
Vidmaster Challenge: Brainpan : We're moving into Halo 3: ODST now, but this achievement can be 50% completed if you have the first 3 of the Mythic Map Pack add-on for Halo 3.
Vidmaster Challenge: Classic : All ODST now.
Vidmaster Challenge: Deja Vu : Well Deja Vu is similar to Annual, the insane achievement with the Iron Skull.
Vidmaster Challenge: Endure : Last One!!!,
And that's it!!!,
You will see the 7 Vidmasters highlighted, if they are all unlocked you will see a button saying 'Unlock My Recon!

Think of acting much like an artist or an author, in the sense you need to develop the right mentality before you can start.
Visualize any scenes that pose a problem.
Practice "being" the character.
When trying to convey an emotion try to make yourself believe that you are the character.
Remember the conveying of emotion is more than just words and tone.
Studying is an important part of acting.

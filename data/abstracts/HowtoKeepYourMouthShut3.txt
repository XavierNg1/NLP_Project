Consider typing the same as talking.
Don’t use “reply all.” You don’t want to develop the reputation as the person at work or in your group of friends that fills their inbox with needless emails.
Leave political and religious chatter out of Facebook and online commenting.
Think “This is permanent” before you post a comment or status update on any social media network.
Pick up the phone.
Understand the legal ramifications of posting online.

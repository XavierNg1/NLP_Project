Gather your things, which are listed below.
Stick one end of your duct tape to a chair, pull it out to your other chair and stick it there leaving about three to four inches hanging free so you'll be able to stick it to the dowel/stick.

,
Repeat step 2 with a second and third strip of duct tape spacing the strips of tape about 3 inches (7.6Â cm) apart.

,
Take your first strip of duct tape and fold in half, sticky sides together (Hot Dog Style), matching the sides so they don't overlap.
Repeat step 4 with the other two strips.

,
Loosen the three ends that you started with, not to be confused with the end that has he extra three to four inches.

,
Start braiding the "ropes" of duct tape.
Cut off some of the duct tape.
Remove the end that is stuck to the chair and attach the sticky sides of the duct tape around the dowel/stick.
Make the Popper.
Learn how to use it!,
Don't ever hit people, animals, or your mom's vase (she won't like it).
Finished.

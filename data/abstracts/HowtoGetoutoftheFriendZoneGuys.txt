It's hard!,
Don't text!,
Don't Call her friend!,
Don't call her by any cute terminology!,
Don't give her as many compliments as you used to!,
Have the balance of being nice guy and a bad boy!,
What If she calls you friend, bud, or anything platonic, just ignore it, especially if you like her or even love her.
Don't always agree with her.
Tell her how you feel!,
Don't just sit around thinking about her.
If this fails, Try moving on.

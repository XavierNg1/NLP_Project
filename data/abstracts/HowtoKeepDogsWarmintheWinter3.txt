Understand your breed's particular susceptibility to the cold.
Provide appropriate shelter.
Make sure the shelter is adequately insulated.
Make sure the shelter protects from the wind.
Bring all outdoor dogs inside if the cold spell becomes exceptionally cold and long; even a barn is warmer than an outdoor dog shelter.
Check the kennel daily to make sure it is dry and there are no leaks in the rough.

Get organized.
Think of a business name.
Decide how to go about it.
Register your domain name.
Select a web hosting company, register through their website and start building your website.
If your web hosting company doesn't offer a shopping cart or merchant service, you can easily set up your own shopping cart using PayPal.
If you plan on also selling at craft and trunk shows, there is a simple and inexpensive way to take payments by credit card using the Square device, a credit card swiper you can plug into a smart phone or iPad.
Consider other alternatives.
Cross-market your website.
Start a blog to build a following of clients and other artists.
Consider using an e-blast service like ConstantContact to keep your clients up to date about sales, new products, etc.
Submit your website to applicable search engines, some may charge a fee.

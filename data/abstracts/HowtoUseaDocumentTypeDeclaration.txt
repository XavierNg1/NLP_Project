The syntax for a DOCTYPE is:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "(Document Type)" "(URL)">
The Doctype is the only XHTML element that is required to have uppercase letters, an exclamation mark, and it is the only tag that is not closed.
Decide which DOCTYPE you will use for your document.
Add the DOCTYPE you chose as the first line at the top of each XHTML document of your website.

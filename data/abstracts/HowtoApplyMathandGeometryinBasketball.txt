Get to know the court's geometry: You have to know all the measures from where you play, so you can have a better spacial notion.
Understand shooting implications: When you shoot you are involving three factors: angles, the impulse, and the position of your arms.
Recognize the math in bouncing: The ball is a semi-sphere that, according to Newton, will have a reaction depending on the force you apply it.
Get an assistant to record percentages: You have to know how many rebounds, shoots, steals, and counter attacks you are making, so you can improve on the areas were you have low performance.
Understand the parabola in shoots: The parabola is the downside curve that's made in every shoot.
Apply geometry in rebounding: Whenever the ball is shot from one side, from a field shoot, it will end on the other side, the most of the times; when shot from the free throw zone it will mostly rebound on the same side.
Understand defensive implications: Every defense has got to know how geometry is applied, so they can know how they can steal more balls, avoid being tricked and stop their man from scoring.

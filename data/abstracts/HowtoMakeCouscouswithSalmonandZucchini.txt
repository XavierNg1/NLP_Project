Set up your plates somewhere accessible before you start.
Add olive oil to your skillet and preheat.
Add the garlic, salt and pepper to taste.
Add the bell peppers and simmer on low - medium heat until they become tender and have released their juices.
Add the diced tomatoes and the cup of white wine.
Approximately ten minutes before the sauce is ready, boil the 1 cup of water and butter in the small saucepan over high heat.
Directly after the water in the small saucepan has come to a boil, pour over the couscous and stir.
Season salmon fillets with salt and pepper, and drizzle with lemon.
Start plating your dishes while the salmon is cooking.
Add the sauce over each portion of couscous.
Serve the salmon directly after it's finished cooking.

Finished.

Have a fill in form ready for the parents.
Make sure the baby is comfortable at all times.
If you have been asked to feed the baby solid food, usually you will need to feed him/her cereal or baby food.
Play with the baby.
To bathe the baby, fill the tub up 1/4 way with lukewarm water.
Put on a new diaper as you did before and then put the baby's pajamas on.
All babies are different, and not all like to go to sleep the same way, but most like to be gently rocked.
Keep checking on the baby as it sleeps.

Measure your net free ventilating area (NFVA): Attics need a certain amount of ventilation based on their square footage.
Install the ridge vent: The ridge vent will create a space for heat to escape the attic, which is why these vents are at the peak of the roof.
Install the soffit vents: Soffit vents are located lower in the eaves of the house and draw in cooler air (forcing the hotter air out through the ridge vent).

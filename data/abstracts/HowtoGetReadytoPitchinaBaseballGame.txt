Stretch your upper body, especially your arm.
After stretching start throwing with a partner.
Talk to your catcher who will catch you that game.
Halfway to your team's infield practice, go to the bullpen and warm up with your catcher.
Talk to your catcher if any of your pitches were better than the other pitches.
After warming up put on warm clothes again so your body doesn't get cold.
After stretching and all of the pre game stuff, it's time to play!,
Be sure you and your catcher are on the same page on the signs.

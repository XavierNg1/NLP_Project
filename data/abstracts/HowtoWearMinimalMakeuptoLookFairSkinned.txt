Wash your face with an exfoliator.
Dry your face fully and apply a slight moisturizer.
You don't want to be using too much make-up.
Dip in three fingers at a time, get the make-up on the fingers, and wipe off the make-up on each cheek, the chin, nose, and forehead.
With both palms, evenly distribute the make-up on your face by slightly rubbing it.
Evenly distribute compact powder, of a light tone, on your face/neck after about five minutes.
Erase all proof that there was make-up on your face, because this must be a natural look.
Taking make-up wipes or simply Kleenex, rub off excess make-up.
Wear a dark-colored lip-gloss or lipstick.

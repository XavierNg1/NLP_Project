Allow your toddler to have their pacifier at bedtime and nap time only.
Use a pacifier clip to attach the pacifier to the sheet of your child's bed.
Start taking it off the bed and hiding it during the day.
When your child stops asking about and looking for the pacifier during the day, start eliminating bedtime usage.

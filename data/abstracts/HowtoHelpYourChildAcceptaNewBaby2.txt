Keep the child's daily routines as normal as possible before, during, and after the birth.
Figure out positive ways for your child to interact with the baby.
Reward and reinforce behavior that's welcoming and positive, so that the child associates being a good sibling with having a happy parent and a happy family.
As much as you possibly can, ignore or overlook behavior that's unwelcoming and negative - the very last thing you want to do is to teach your older child that your precious attention and time can be obtained just as easily by pinching the baby or by saying "I hate the baby" as by offering to bring the baby a clean diaper.

Try talking to the baby about the older child when the older child is nearby, e.g. "Baby, look what your smart big brother did, he tied his own shoes/made his own bed/found the remote for me" and "Baby, when you grow up, Big Sister can show you how to play Candyland.",
Don't *always* drop what you're doing as soon as the baby cries.
Do fun things alone with your older child, especially if you do things with just the baby.
Do fun things as a family.

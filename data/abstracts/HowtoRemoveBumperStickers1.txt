Find a powerful hair dryer or rent a heat gun.
Hold the hair dryer about 6" from the sticker and blow heat directly on the sticker for a minute or two.
Peel back a corner using your fingernail (or razor blade to grab the edge only).
Pull slowly by the corner of the sticker in the opposite direction and continue to apply heat as needed.

Let the area cool once the sticker is off.

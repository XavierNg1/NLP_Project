Buy a SD4 (Structure deck 4 Fury From The Deep).
From your Starter deck, it is highly recommended you use all 3 of your Mother Grizzly and A Legendary Ocean.
Find cards that will boost any WATER deck such as Warrior of Atlantis, a versatile card you could use to search out "A legendary Ocean", and Aqua Spirit, a Special Summon monster with decent ATK and a good Control Effect.
If you choose Beatdown, get some High ATK Level 5 WATER monsters like Giga Gagagigo and Terrorking Salmon, which can be summoned without tribute from A Legendary Ocean.
If you choose Control, get cards like Gora Turtle, Maryokutai, B.E.S.
If you choose Combo, this means that you heavily rely on Levia-Dragon - Daedalus' and Codarus' Effects.
Even if you only plan to use a Beatdown or Control-centered deck, read steps #5 - 7 to get more ideas for your deck.
It can be a good idea to collect "Shark" cards from the new show.

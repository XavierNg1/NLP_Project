The following stretching routine is tailored specifically to the purpose of achieving the ability to perform both front splits and side splits.
Don't forget to warm-up your body before performing any of these exercises.
Perform these stretches at your own risk!,
The details on how to perform each of the stretches are discussed in the following sections.
As with all stretches, you should not stretch to the point of intense pain!,
Lower Back Stretches


These stretches work mostly the lower back, but also make some demands on your abdominal, and your external obliques (sides).
Lying Buttock Stretch


This mainly stretches your buttocks (gluteal muscles) but also makes some demands on your groin and upper inner-thigh area.
Groin and Inner-Thigh Stretch


This mainly stretches your groin and upper inner-thigh area, but also makes some demands on your lower back.
Seated Leg Stretches


These include three different stretches performed for the calves, hamstrings, and inner-thighs, but they are all performed in very similar positions and I do all three stretches (in the order given) for one leg before performing them for the other leg.
Seated Calf Stretch




With your leg extended directly in front of you, face your leg and bend it slightly.
Seated Hamstring Stretch




Now that our calf is stretched, we can get a more effective hamstring stretch (since inflexibility in the calf can be a limiting factor in this hamstring stretch).
Seated Inner-Thigh Stretch




You should still be sitting on the bench with your outstretched leg in front of you.
Psoas Stretch


This stretch is sometimes called the runner's start because the position you are in resembles that of a sprinter at the starting block.
Quadriceps Stretch


For this stretch you will need one (or two) pillows or soft cushions to place between your knee and the floor.
Lying `V' Stretch


This stretch is very good for working toward a side (Chinese) split (see section The Side Split).

Make sure that this is actually something you want to do.
Take singing lessons.
If you want to be in a band/group: you need to look for other dedicated trustworthy musicians that have the same creative vision that you do and will feel comfortable creatively collaborating with.
Once you feel a comfortable with your voice: you need to get use to singing in front of others, start singing around people you are already somewhat familiar with and comfortably around like at a school choir, or church.

Now you need to start getting comfortable around strangers: (1) Go to your local fair and ask them if they have open slots for you to perform.
Optional: Make connections!,
Start recording demos.
Start promoting yourself like there's no tomorrow.
Send out your demo(s) to record labels.
Keep on going!,
Do not let your label control who you are after you have signed a recording contract.

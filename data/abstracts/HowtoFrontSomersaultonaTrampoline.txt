Practice your tuck jumps, front and back drops until you can do them very well.
Bounce on your hands and knees, and count yourself in.
Get a friend (or preferably a qualified coach) to come to your side and take your hand.
Once you can do this perfectly with the other person, ask them to stand back and try the somersault alone.
Keep your eyes open!

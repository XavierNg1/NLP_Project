Don't make eye contact.
Sit in a seat by the window, then have someone you trust sit by you, or squeeze in past someone already sitting on the outer seat, so as to stop the bully sitting next to you.
Make plans with your friend(s) to save a seat for you.
If the bully is sitting right behind you and is poking you in the head and/or saying insults, ignore them.
If your friend is beside you, use the 'Invisible Bully Conversation' technique.
If this fails, reach into your bag and find something to do while the bully is talking.
Pretend to be asleep.

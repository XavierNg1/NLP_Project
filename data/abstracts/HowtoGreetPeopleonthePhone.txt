If you've been answering the phone in a slapdash manner, think about how you impact others hearing you.
Be aware of the tone of your voice.
Stop drinking or chewing food or gum before taking a call.
Answer promptly.
Greet the caller with a "Hello".
Listen politely and carefully to the caller's request.
If you need to put the caller on hold, then tell them so politely.
Leave a comprehensible and clear answering machine or voicemail message.
After the caller has established what they want, use their name to show that you've listened and to establish rapport and repeat back anything that you think needs clarification.
Finish your call on a pleasant note, even if the conversation wasn't pleasant for any reason.

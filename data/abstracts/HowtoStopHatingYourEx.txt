Look deeper.
Take responsibility.Now that you have identified the emotions you are feeling, you must take ownership for them.
Learn to calm your anger.
Stop ruminating.
Say goodbye.
Don’t isolate yourself.You may feel alone after a breakup, but you don’t have to be.
Demonstrate gratitude for the people who have stuck by you.
Stay single for a while.
Make healthy choices.Feeling sucky about your ex can also make you feel sucky about yourself.
Pursue your dreams.Use the time that you are spending feeling hatred or resentment toward your ex for the benefit of your future.
Seek professional help if you can’t feel better on your own.

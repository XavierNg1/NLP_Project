Make an appointment with a speech and language therapist.One of the mainstays of treating progressive aphasia is to work with a speech and language therapist to address the challenges that you are having with language and with communication.
Learn alternate modes of communication.Some people struggle more with language comprehension (understanding written and/or spoken words), while others find expressive language (speaking, articulating, and finding appropriate word choices) to be the primary challenge.
Know that progressive aphasia can be managed, but not cured.When you go to see a speech and language therapist, there is nothing she can do to reverse or otherwise slow the progression of your condition.
Connect with others who also have progressive aphasia.The challenges of those who suffer from progressive aphasia are unique, so to connect with others who are in the same boat can be extremely helpful.
Carry information about your illness with you.Because progressive aphasia affects your language and communication abilities, these very communication challenges can make it difficult to explain your illness to others.
Ask for modified duties at the workplace.
Ask your doctor to perform regular clinical exams.It is important to receive regular clinical exams from your doctor both to assess how your disease is progressing (and how you are coping), as well as to ensure that nothing else is going on.
Consider asking for a head CT or MRI.In addition to ruling out other degenerative brain diseases, it is also key to differentiate progressive aphasia from other causes of aphasia (communication troubles), such as aphasia resulting from a stroke or a traumatic brain injury.
Learn the causes of progressive aphasia.
Know the expected course of progressive aphasia.As you seek treatment for your progressive aphasia, it is important to know what to expect.

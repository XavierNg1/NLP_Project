Close your eyes.
Sneak.
Be SILENT.
Grab snacks, then dash.
When it is bright enough to go outside, dash as fast as you can.
Hide under the table.
Know Your Enemies.
More monkeys are better then one.
Curl up in bed, and sleep.

,
It's morning once again; Now creep downstairs QUIETLY.
Do the jungle theme's quest.
Listen for the return of the buffalo.
Recover SAFELY.
Sky dive to get through all the clouds.

Shuffle the deck and deal three cards to each person.
The bidding begins.
In bidding, a person determines how much their hand is roughly worth.
The dealer is not permitted to bid.
After bidding ceases, the person who holds the highest bid typically chooses a suit to be the trump suit.
After a trump suit is chosen, the players discard all cards that do not match the trump suit.
The play goes in a clockwise direction with the person to the left of the bidder leading.
After everyone has used up all their cards, the players count the number of tricks they have.
If the person who bid fails to match or exceed the bid they made, then the amount they bid is deducted from their score.
If a person is at or exceeds 100 points but has not won the game, they are not allowed to add points to their score unless they chose the trump suit and made their bid.

The above is repeated, with the person to the right of the previous dealer dealing the new hand.

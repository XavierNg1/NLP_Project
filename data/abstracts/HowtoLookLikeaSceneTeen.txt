First, you have to pay attention to yourself and not others.
Now you need to look at your current clothes and decide what style they are.
If you don't have any of those types of clothes, or any clothes that could be the style you're going for, maybe you should take an article of clothing and adding maybe one piece of fabric to make it what you want it to be.
It's time to do the age old thing that everyone does once in a while, if not everyday; shopping.
Shop for bright colors, but at the same time, keep an eye out for those browns, blacks, and whites, as they go great with a colorful shirt.

Color, Color, Color!,
Makeup, you kinda need it if your a girl.
Shoes can be anything, as long they compliment your feelings that day.
Attitude and witty comebacks?

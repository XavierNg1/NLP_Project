Figure out if you have lag.
As soon as the game starts, throw a grenade, AWAY from your teammates mind you, and study the explosion.
Check your timer, this is the most efficient way of safely finding out if you have lag, most games have a timer that begins counting down at 15 seconds, check this timer constantly if you suspect lag, if the timer skips from say 11:40 seconds right down to 11:37 seconds, then you only have minor 2-3 second lag.
Now that you know how lagged out you are, try making the best of it, remember, lag goes both ways, sometimes.

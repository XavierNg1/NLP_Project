Understand that curly hair really is beautiful.
Look at famous icons with curly hair, even if it's not necessarily natural: Beyonce, Emmy "Rossum", Rose from "Titanic," Sarah Jessica Parker, Kate Hudson, Debra Messing, etc.
Treat your hair to deep treatments, since it is naturally drier than other hair types.
Avoid the triangle look; this happens when your curls weigh the roots of your hair down and it creates flatness at the top and bulk at the bottom, resulting in your hair looking like a Christmas tree.
Take care of your hair.
Add moisture to your hair with a good daily conditioner and leave in conditioner every time you style your hair.
Detangle and comb your hair in the shower with conditioner.
Concentrate on making your natural hair look great instead of straightening your hair.
Try out different hairdos if you're having a bad curly hair day.
Accessorize!,
Get a good curly hair cut to show off your curls at their best.
Be grateful for your voluptuous twisted locks.
Love your hair.

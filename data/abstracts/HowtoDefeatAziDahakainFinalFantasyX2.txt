Start with one girl in the Songstress dressphere and the other two in the Dark Knight or Berserker dresspheres.
Immediately use a Light Curtain to cast Protect on all the girls.
Have the songstress use Magical Masque -- it will help you later.

Hit Azi Dahaka with all you've got with your Dark Knights or Berserkers while the Songstress is dancing.

Continue to use Magical Masque and hit Azi with all you got.
After a long battle, you will see him fall for the count.

Wash your pet with a good detergent based pet shampoo and very warm water.
Use enough shampoo to make a really nice lather.
Thorough rinsing with very warm water is very important because much of the smell causing oil that was sprayed on you pet is suspended in the detergent.

,
Squeeze out as much of the rinse water as is convenient and allow your pet to shake off the rest.
Using a mixture of 1 ounce of OdorXit Concentrate with a quart of warm water, pour small amounts on the places where the pet was sprayed and rub it in.
Leave the OdorXit solution on their coat for at least 5 or 10 minutes at which point it can be rinsed off or towel dried.

,
Any traces of skunk spray that did not get wet with the deodorant will continue to smell of skunk.

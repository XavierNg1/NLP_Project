Go to a home improvement store and rent a submersible sump pump.
Set up the sump pump and discharge hoses, connecting the hoses to a clean out.
Lower the pump into the pool and plug it in.
Watch your water disappear, monitoring the discharge carefully.
Every foot or so of water level decrease, spray the perimeter of the pool's previous water line with a hose.
Wait as the pump removes almost all of the water, draining the last bit manually.
Blast debris out of the pop-ups with your hose.
Clean away any calcium or scale rings.
Perform an acid wash on your pool (optional).
Estimate the amount of time it will take to fill the pool with your current pumps.
Fill up your pool.
Wait for the water to settle a few hours before adding any chemicals or additives.

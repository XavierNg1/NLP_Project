First off, you should consider if you want this to be a full band or a one man project.
If you choose to make this a real band, you should find your band members.
The vocalist will have to be able of snarling (also called shrieking) and maybe growling too.
Your guitarists should tune their guitar in either classical tuning (E) or D. Remember, this is not meant to be played as deep as death metal.
The drummer should most preferably know how to blastbeat at a fast pace.
Find a good bassist that has good timing.
Some black metal bands use a keyboard to have different sounds integrated in their songs.
An important part of black metal is the lyrics.
A good name is also important, and the options here are endless.
To accompany the band name, create a logo.
Appearance is not everything.
Write a song.
A lot of black metal recordings are of poor quality.
That's pretty much all you need to know, but if you need some more info about black metal, look around on Wikipedia and Google, then you'll find some.

Never bargain with your stuff...just release it!

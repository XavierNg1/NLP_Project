Crochet your last ring of stitches.
Pull the last loop of yarn off your hook and extend it out, pulling excess yarn from the working end of your yarn.
Cut the middle of the yarn loop with your scissors.
Thread a yarn or tapestry needle onto the end of your yarn tail.
Insert the needle under the first stitch of the round, moving from outside to inside, then pull your yarn tight.
Take your needle and pull it back toward the end of your round, inserting it into the middle of your last bound off stitch, the one at the very end of your last row.
Weave in the tail of your yarn on the inside of your project.

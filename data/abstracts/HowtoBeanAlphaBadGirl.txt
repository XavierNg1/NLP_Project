Be prepared for some work.
Being bad doesn't mean you have to be rude.
Drama follows you everywhere you go and with everything you do.
Get out there and be noticed.
You don't have to be the prettiest or skinniest girl in the world to be an alpha bad girl.
Do random things that are interesting and fun so other people around you will want to be with you every second.
Manipulating people isn't always the right choice, but if you want to become the ultimate alpha bad girl, you have to.
Keep your reputation/status up to date and fresh with every breath you take.
If you aren't invited to the best parties, then don't give up.
Do outrageous things, but if you're feeling blue then don't go out because you never want people to see you at your worst.

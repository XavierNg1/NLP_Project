Know that when getting male and female guppies, there will be babies, and lots of them!,
Always start by cycling the tank before adding any living creatures.
Drip acclimate your guppies for 4 to 5 hours.
For people who aren't serious guppy breeders, a flake food enhanced with shrimp should suffice just fine.
Enjoy your guppies!

Use a medium sized pan or a cast iron skillet.
Put a tablespoon or so of oil into the pan.
Heat the pan on medium-high.
Add the fries and stir them well so that they are evenly coated in the oil.
Stir the fries often as they cook.
Cook the fries for three to five minutes.
Remove excess oil by placing the fries on a paper towel-covered plate covered and patting dry.
Finished.

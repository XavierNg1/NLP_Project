See if you're taller than most of the girls you know.
See if you have a hard time finding clothes that fit you.
See if everyone around you asks if you play basketball or volleyball.
See if you're taller than 5'6".
See if you're just hitting puberty earlier than other people.
See if you can never blend in when you're in a crowd.
See if you never have enough legroom.
See if you tower over most of the guys your age.
See if you feel guilty for always blocking everyone's view when you go to a concert or the movies.
Remember that tall is beautiful.
Don't slouch.
Don't worry about being taller than the guys.
Remember that the grass is always greener on the other side.

Use posh slang.
Embrace posh phrases and sayings.
Use some words that might seem formal or out of date.
Say an “an” sound like an “eh” sound.
Pronounce the “ee” at the end of some words as an “eh.” When pronouncing the final “ee” sound in a word (such as (the “y” in “picky”), articulate the sound like an “eh.” For example:


”Quickly” should sound more like “quickleh”
“Sorry” should sound more like “sorreh.”
”Barley” should sound more like “barleh.”,
Lengthen the “oo” sound in some words.
Do not enunciate the “w” in words that end in “wer.” People who speak posh tend to gloss over the “w” sound in certain words.
Lengthen vowels at the end of a sentence.
Replace the “uh” sound in some words with an “ah” sound.
Watch movies and television shows.
Hang around others who talk posh.
Practice a lot.

As you approach the lock:


Skipper - Drop off your shore crew, asking them to close the front doors of the boat.
The lock crew needs to set the lock.
The lock crew opens the gates.
The skipper should enter the lock.
Close the gate behind the boat, and check the paddles are shut.

,
Open the paddles at the other end of the lock.
Once the water level has equalized you can open the gates to let the skipper drive out of the lock.
Drive out of the lock and steer alongside the bank at a place where the lock crew can re-board, or simply wait in the lock exit.

,
Close the gates - except that if a boat is approaching the lock from ahead, you can save them and you time by leaving the gates open for them: if the other boat is lightly-crewed, you might even wait to close the gates after the other boat has entered.

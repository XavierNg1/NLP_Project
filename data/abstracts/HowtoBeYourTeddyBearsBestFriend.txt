Love your teddy.
Take your teddy with you wherever you can, just be careful at school, on the beach and so on so your teddy will not get muddy or lost.

,
Have your teddy sit with you at dinner if it's OK with your parents.
Hug and kiss them goodnight and put them to bed.
Tell them everything.
Dress them up!,
Care for them.
Give your Teddy a birthday party!,
Make him his own little corner in your bedroom.

,
If your teddy is scared, be sure to comfort him no matter what time of day it is!

Don't attempt to try to train any bird unless you have been on a course and have access to a mentor.
Before doing anything, look into the falconry laws in your area.
Make sure you read every book you can, and buy all the equipment you need, before you get your bird.
Find a sponsor (mentor) to guide you.
As an apprentice falconer in the United States, you only have the options of a Red-Tailed Hawk or an American Kestrel for a bird (unless state laws state otherwise).
Keep the bird in the house during its first weeks with you.
First, teach the falcon to hop or fly to the glove on your fist.
When adding the lure to your training, begin with letting the bird eat off of it so that this too will become a recognised source of food.
Once you feel confident that the Falcon is keen to the lure, you can begin swinging it.
Man the falcon to the hood early and even after the hooding goes well, continue to do hood exercises every day.
Keep everything clean and neat - all the time.

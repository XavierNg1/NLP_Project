Consider if there's something you have been reluctant to accept about your partner.
Think about your own issues.
See if you're only in the relationship because you don't want to hurt your partner's feelings.
See if you're just in the relationship because you're afraid of being alone.
Be willing to accept that maybe you're just not that into your partner anymore.
Meditate.
See if you're embarrassed to bring your partner around.
Recognize if you are in a manipulative or controlling relationship.
See if your partner does not respect you.
See if your partner is constantly berating you.
See if your partner is ashamed of your relationship.
See if you're always the one who wants to be intimate.
See if they pressure you to do something you are not comfortable with.
See if others have warned you about dating the person you're with.
See if things are moving too fast.
See if there's no talk of the future.
See if your relationship is suffering from a serious problem.
See if your relationship is "on again, off again".
See if you have conflicting life goals.
See if either of you has been unfaithful -- repeatedly.
See if you've just grown apart.
See if you keep secrets from each other.
See if neither of you is willing to put in the effort.
See if you've started spending a lot of time apart.
Never break up in the heat of the moment.
Try spending time apart if you need some time to think about it more.
See if your relationship is worth saving after all.

Avoid using the word “don’t.” If it seems like the kids in your group aren’t listening to you, make sure you’re phrasing your instructions clearly enough.
Separate misbehaving kids from the group.
Talk with the child about their behavior.
Address the behavior instead of the child’s character.
Use consequences.
Make your consequences fair to the whole group.
Avoid criticizing or blaming the children.

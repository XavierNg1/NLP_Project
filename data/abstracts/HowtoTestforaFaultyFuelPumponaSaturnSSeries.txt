Listen for the fuel pump to run.
Listen for the relay to switch.If the relay is not "clicking," try swapping it for the relay that controls the horn (if the horn is working).
Test for voltage to the pump.
Test the ground on the pump.
If you have voltage to the pump and the ground is good, then you may have a faulty fuel pump.

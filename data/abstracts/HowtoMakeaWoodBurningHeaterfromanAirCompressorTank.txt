Find an air compressor that no longer works, and remove the motor/compressor assembly.
Figure out how you want to configure your wood heater.
Lay out a door opening on the side of the tank.
Mark two vertical lines at 1/3 points of the tank's diameter (or the width of the end of the tank if horizontal).Using a steel cutting wheel on a grinder or saw, cut one side you have marked for the door of your heater.
Fasten hinges centered on the cut you have just made.
Cut the remaining three sides of your door.
Cut some 1/8 to 3/16 flat stock one inch wide to weld along the inside of the door opening.
Drill a 5/16 inch hole through the edge of the door opposite the hinges near the center.Keeping the pencil rod tight to the inside of the door surface, weld a 5/16 flat washer on both the inside and outside of the door to hold it in place.
Weld two 1/2 inch steel bars cut to fit across the side of the tank about 3 inches below the bottom edge of the door.
Cut a piece of heavy gauge steel expanded metal to lay on the bars welded in place in the previous step.
Cut a hole in the top of the tank on the opposite side from the door for your flue.
Weld or rivet the stove pipe to the flange at the flue hole you created at the top of your tank.
Cut a three to four inch piece of pipe about 5 inches long for an air inlet/damper assembly underneath the fire grate below the door.Weld the air inlet pipe/damper assembly to the tank, centered on the hole cut earlier.
Attach legs/a base to the bottom of the tank to support it at the height you want.
Install a section of stove pipe to the flue on top so that it has enough height to draft (draw smoke up through it).

Set up a template for your newsletter starting with page size (US letter size or A4 are usually best).
Develop a layout grid which sets page margins, divides your page into columns, and establishes horizontal lines on which to "hang" your text and pictures.
Design a simple masthead with a logo, newsletter name (try 30 to 36 point type), business name, issue number and date.
Learn to use your style sheets--they'll save a lot of time in the end.

Determine whether you are eligible for BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing.If you have a first degree family member (a parent, a sibling, or a child) with breast cancer before age 50 or ovarian cancer, who has tested positive for either BRCA1 or BRCA2, you are eligible for genetic testing.
Tell your doctor if you had breast cancer before age 50 or ovarian cancer.If you have a personal history of breast cancer before age 50, or ovarian cancer at any age, you are also eligible for genetic testing.
Take note if you or a family member has had "triple negative" breast cancer.If you or an first degree family member has "triple negative" (negative for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2) breast cancer before the age of 60, the person who had the cancer is eligible for genetic testing.
Seek pre-test genetic counselling.Prior to receiving the blood test, it is mandatory to receive pre-test genetic counselling.
Go for the blood test.The blood test itself is very simple.
Book a post-test genetic counselling appointment.Because of the gravity of this particular test, you will be required to receive your results in the presence of a genetic counsellor (just as you had to see one prior to receiving the test).

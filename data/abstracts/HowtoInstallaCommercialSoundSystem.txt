Decide if you can live without a stereo program or not.
Do your homework.
Determine the amplifier inputs.
Make sure the amplifiers provide an audio output on a "voltage of either one or more of the following: 25, 70 or 100 volts; not as an output to match a 4 to 8 'ohm speaker input impedance offered by traditional receiver / amplifiers used at home.
Ensure the audio transformer voltage matches, at least, one that is available on the amplifier.
Know that speaker and audio transformer power ratings are often expressed in watts.
Use a wire size large enough to provide the power needed at the furthest speaker.
Don't settle for tinny sound.

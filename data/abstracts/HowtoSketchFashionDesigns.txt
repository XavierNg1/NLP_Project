Invest in a good stencil set.
Once you get accustomed to the stencils, start drawing without them.
Have several sketchbooks that help keep everything organized, but a folder would work just as well.
Once you finalize your sketch, you can choose to create an entire line using the same style.Some nice final touches are haircuts that go with the outfits, and don't forget accessories

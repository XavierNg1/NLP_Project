You will need GIMP to get the sprites isolated and animate them.
Start GIMP and open your sprite sheet.
Select the first frame of the series and select it with the Rectangular select tool.
Once you are happy with the selection, press Ctrl+C to copy the selected pixels.
Now, you should notice that there is a colored background.
Select the next frame of the animation from your sprite sheet.
Repeat for the remaining frames from your sheet.
Save your file as an animation when prompted.
Click OK and you're done!

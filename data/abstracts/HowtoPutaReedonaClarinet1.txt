Make sure you have a ligature.
Decide on a reed.
If you wish to wet your reed, wet it only in water.
Slide the ligature over the mouthpiece until it's almost in its final position, with the screws loosened a bit.

,
Carefully slide the wet reed under the ligature.
Slide the ligature down to about the bottom of the reed and tighten it just enough to hold the reed snugly, but not enough to hold it too much (which can stifle the vibrations of the reed), or to break the ligature.

Gather some pets.
Give them acting names.
Come up with what the video/series will be about, then write a script.
If you haven't already, create specific details for the characters in the video.
Now it's time to think about how the location looks.
After you have thought about how outside will look, now it's time to define the inside of the house of the main character.
 You are finally done with the setups needed!,
 Now that everything is prepared, rehearse!,
 It is time to make sure the lighting is just right.
Finally, you are ready to start recording the video.
Once you have made enough clips to satisfy your desire to make a video, put it on a computer and edit it!,
Make sure to add background music!,
When it is done, upload it to YouTube!

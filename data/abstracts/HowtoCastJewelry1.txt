Carve a piece of hard modeling wax into your desired shape.
Attach 3-4 "sprues," wax wires that will provide a channel for the wax to melt out later.
Attach the mold to the sprue base using a bit of melted rubber.
Put the flask on top of the sprue base, making sure you have a quarter inch between the wall of the flask and the model.

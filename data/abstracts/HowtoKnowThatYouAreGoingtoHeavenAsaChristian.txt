Repent, be baptized, receive the Holy Spirit and be born again by grace.
Keep this in mind...:






 Confess with your mouth, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.
Claim this that when we confess with our mouth that "Jesus is Lord " we are saying that Jesus is the master, your master, and that He is your one and only "mediator" to Father God: That the Holy Spirit is your comforter and guide and "shall never leave you!",

Pray this prayer now: "Dear Jesus, Lord, I come before you with my life.
Receive the Sacraments.
Instead of placing your trust in your prayer or sincerity, place your trust in Christ.
If you don't have a new relationship with sin, you don't have a relationship with God in Christ.
Recognize ("know") your new life: and fully understand that you will never be the same: "If any is in Christ, then you are a new creation, for all things have passed away and behold all things are become new.
"Yet to all who received Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God â€” children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.",
Receive the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and Lord.

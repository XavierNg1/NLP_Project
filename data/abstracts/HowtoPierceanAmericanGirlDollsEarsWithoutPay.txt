Set your American Girl doll against an area where it won't slip.
Mark each ear lightly with a pencil.
Using a thumbtack, slowly start pushing the sharp edge into the mark placed on the ear.
Use a sewing pin to break through the vinyl if you have ended up with a dent instead of a hole.
Evaluate the size of the holes using an earring.
Enlarge the holes if needed.
Keep evaluating the size of the hole you're making; it won't hold the earrings straight or look nice if you make it too big.
Have your doll wear her new earrings frequently.

Gather your materials.
Cut out small squares of the adhesive craft foam measuring approximately 2 1⁄2 inches (6.4 cm) each.
Write out one of the letters you have chosen for your keychain on each piece of the craft foam using a pencil or marker.
Use a pair of sharp scissors to cut out the craft foam letter.
Lay all the letters on of the remaining piece of craft foam, the one with no adhesive.
Cut out the overall shape of your keychain on the craft foam.
Peel the backing from each letter.
Use a paper punch, or something with a sharp point, to make a hole about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the top of the foam shape you have made.
Attach a split ring or keychain assembly through the hole.

Your secondary weapon should be your second best gun.
Your backup weapon should be a smaller weapon like the jolt or triad.

,If you are a scout, a popular load out is a recon/retaliator with a maverick/strongarm, and a triad/jolt

,
If you are a sniper, popular weapon choices would be a Longshot, Longstrike or centurion.
if you are a heavy, (which means you carry a lot of gear) good weapons would be a Stampede/rapidstrike, a hail-fire, a rayven, a stryfe, a rhino-fire, a sledgefire, slingfire, a demolisher 2-1, or any semi-auto or fully-auto weapon will do.
If you are doing an outside war, it is optional to get a backpack/pack (or and bag if necessary) that will carry all ammo, guns, depending on how long the war is ( bandoliers and nerf blaster sleeves are also available ).
If you can, make a holster out of the box your secondary gun came in.
This is optional: Carry a Secret Strike and extra ammo in your pockets.

Always carry a melee weapon if allowed.

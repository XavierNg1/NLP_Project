Add details to your diary entries.
Write a title for each diary entry.
Think about including a “Table of Contents.” If you’re writing in a paper notebook, set aside several pages at the beginning in order to insert a “Table of Contents” as you go.
Consider writing for an “ideal reader.” You may not ever plan to have your diary read, or you may be blogging online under a pseudonym.
Use writing prompts.

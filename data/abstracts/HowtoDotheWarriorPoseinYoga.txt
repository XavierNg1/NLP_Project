Stand with both feet together near the top of the mat.
Step back with your right foot, angling it to your right.
Sink your butt so that your front knee is directly over your left foot, bent almost to 90-degrees.
Rotate your upper body so that your hips and shoulders face straight ahead.
Slightly "push" your feet apart from each other on the mat.
Slowly raise your hands up over your head.
Deepen the stretch slightly with each exhalation.
Remember that form is far more important than how far you go -- proper form will make your more flexible while still avoiding injury.
Inhale and straighten your legs to ease out of the pose.

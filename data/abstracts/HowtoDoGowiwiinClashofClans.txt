Drop your golems spaced away from each other.
When the defences are targeting your golems, quickly drop your wallbreakers.
Drop your beaming wizards in a sprinkled way.
Drop your royal witches last but not least.
Drop your spells and heroes only if you need them as this composition already can give you a 2 star.

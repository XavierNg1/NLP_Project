Diet is part of the cure of Type 2.
Exercise may be a cure (Type 2).
Have a medical plan for exercise to adjust dosage downward, "if taking insulin or using blood sugar lowering drugs", because exercise lowers blood glucose, and too much insulin can possibly result in hypoglycemia.

,
Take medications on time as instructed, keeping all self-testing records.
Follow your doctor's guidelines, including, but not limited to: checking your blood sugar as directed, taking insulin/medication as directed, following a meal schedule, if necessary.
Have your hemoglobin A1c test done every 3 months or as directed by your physician.
Stop smoking!,
Know how to treat hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar which can occur in both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes.
High (hyper) blood sugar is life-threatening for another reason -- untreated it can rapidly progress into diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which frequently requires hospitalization.
Low (hypo) blood sugar is, also, life-threatening -- called hypoglycemia caused by too much insulin, for little or no food, or other overdose: you need to know how to recognize and treat it -- mainly when taking insulin or glucose lowering drugs.
Once the patient has self-treated, wait 10-15 minutes, then test his or her blood sugar to confirm that blood sugar levels have risen above 70mg/dL (3.9mmol/L).
Intervene for another person.
Get emergency help, if the diabetic is: unconscious, unable to swallow, or having a seizure, as outside intervention is necessary.
Know how to use a glucagon emergency kit; get one and instruct family members and friends how to use it.

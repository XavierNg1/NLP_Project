Go outside.
Sit down on a rock, some dry leaves, or simply on the ground.
Next, close your eyes, and picture in your mind the nature that surrounds you.
Do something peaceful, such as fishing or meditating in the woods.
Go on a hike.
Go camping or backpacking.
Practice primitive skills while in the woods to share a connection with our ancestors, if you want to go further.
Doing these kinds of things will bring about an appreciation of nature, and make you realize how beautiful it is, and that we too, are creatures of this earth.

Familiarize yourself with sewing.
Measure your cat's height from the top of his back to where you want the bottom of the cloak to be.
Measure your cat's length from the chest to back by the tail.
Measure all the way around the cat's neck.
Using the piece of paper with the measurements as a "list", go shopping and buy all the necessities.
From the measurement around the cat's neck, draw a circle on paper to represent the neck.
Cut out the bottom right quarter of the circle (mentioned above) like in a pie diagram.
Lay out the fabric folded in half horizontally.
Cut around the paper (on the fabric) as if it were a pattern.
Using a sewing machine, sew seams 1/4" (0.63cm) on the main piece of fabric.
Clip the safety pin onto the edge of the elastic and thread this through the space in-between the seam of the neck.

Secure the outfit onto your cat and tie the elastic together.

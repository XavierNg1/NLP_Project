Listen to good lyrics.
Understand what makes an insightful song.
Use lines people can relate to.
Write raw feelings down.
Once finished, re-read everything you wrote, and look for key phrases.
Start with the verse.
Remember to rhyme.
Go to the chorus.
Then the second verse.
Repeat the chorus.
You're ready for the bridge.
Repeat the last chorus.
Once you're done, you should have enough phrases for two verses and a chorus, take out the piano, or the guitar, and find a melody that suits the "mood" of your song.
Once you have a base for the notes and melodies, try to incorporate some of your phrases into the music.
When youÂ´re done, you will have backup notes and lyrics.

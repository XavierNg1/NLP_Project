Add parchment paper or aluminum foil to a baking pan that is 9 x 9 square inches.
Allow the ice cream to churn (if you are working with homemade ice cream) then place it inside the baking pan.
Place a sheet of parchment paper on a huge baking sheet.
Transfer the cut ice cream squares to the baking sheet with parchment paper.
Make the chocolate topping while the ice cream squares are freezing.
Pour the coconut oil into the mixture and mix together until well combined and completely melted with the chocolate.
Once the ice cream squares are firm and the chocolate mixture has reached a medium temperature, take the baking sheet outside of the freezer.

Understand the terminology before you buy: "Wide-angle" is generally considered any focal length below 35mm, and shows a wide field of view.
Define your need: After using your camera with whatever lenses you have now, you may find that you can't get the photos you want because your subject is often too far away, or your subject may often be too large to get all of it in the picture.
Mid-range zoom: This is a lens with a focal length of approximately 18-70mm.
Telephoto zoom: This is probably the lens you'll buy next.
Wide angle zoom: Get out your wallet -- there are no bargains here.
"Normal" lens: A lens that covers a modest angle of view is simple to design to perform well at wide apertures with cheap materials.
Quality: Virtually all prime lenses are better than a zoom lens that covers the same focal length.
One-lens system: A mid-range zoom such as an 18-55mm or 24-70mm will cover most photos you'll want to take.
Two-lens system: If you only want to carry two lenses, use a wide-angle zoom like an 18-55mm, and pair it with a good telephoto, such as a 75-300mm.
Finished.

Calculate the area enclosed by the curve.
Choose a vector field such that ∂Q∂x−∂P∂y=1{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial Q}{\partial x}}-{\frac {\partial P}{\partial y}}=1}.
Find dy{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }y} and substitute x{\displaystyle x} and dy{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }y} into the integral.
Use trigonometric identities to evaluate the integral.

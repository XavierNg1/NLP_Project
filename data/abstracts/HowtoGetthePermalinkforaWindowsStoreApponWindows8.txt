Visit a search engine in your web browser.
Type the name of the app you'd like to look for, along with the two words "Windows Store" in the search bar, and submit the search.
Look for a search result that will lead you to the app itself that has a link that begins with "apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-US/app/" then the product name and some other randomized numbers and letters.
Open this link.
Open the browser window you used to create the permalink search (which should be already displaying, as the browser doesn't give you ample enough time to research the correct link), if it wasn't correct to begin with).

Look up at the address bar.

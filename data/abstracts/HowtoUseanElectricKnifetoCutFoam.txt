Draw your pattern onto the foam using a permanent marker.
Place your marked foam block along the edge of a table, with the first marked line you want to cut overlapping the table's edge by about an inch.
Lubricate both sides of your electric carving knife's blade with a non-stick cooking spray.
Continue cutting without pause, for the remainder of the line's length.

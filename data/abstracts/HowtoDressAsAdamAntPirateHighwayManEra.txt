Start with a shirt, which can be either black or white.
The trousers should be tight, the most basic being black skinny jeans.
For shoes, preferably knee, or thigh high black boots, with a wide top, with a flat heel.
Wear wide, leather belts, with chunky gold or silver buckles - either square, or possibly skull shaped.
Try to find a formal military jacket, the type with a lot of gold striping and epaulets, either waist length, or longer in the back.
Wear a lot of jewelry, big silver skull shaped rings, for example.
If you want to copy the "Stand and Deliver" outfit, try to find a wide strapped white, or peach colored waistcoat (the style is known as a Regency waistcoat), with embroidery, along with a black tri-corn hat, and plain black eye mask.
To copy the "Prince Charming" music video, button the shirt up to the top, and tie a red, white and green stripped scarf around your neck in a floppy bow, which can be tucked into the jacket.
Paint your nails either black, or purple with a gold stripe down the center.

Observe the pecan trees for indications the nuts are ready to fall.
Establish the fact that the nuts your target tree are bearing are worth the efforts you will put forth.
Observe the tree itself for indications of the nut crop, both in quality and quantity.
Watch for the husks to begin splitting.
Mow around trees with lawn grasses beneath them, circling the tree so that the clippings discharge away from the trunk, while beginning to circle as near the trunk as possible.
Pick up pecans when they begin to drop, since wet weather can be detrimental to the nuts, and foraging wildlife may beat you to them if they are left on the ground.
Keep leaves raked up or blown away using a leaf blower if possible, since finding the pecans in a sea of similarly colored leaves will make the task even more difficult.

Harvest the pecans using a method that's appropriate for your scale.
Sort out deformed or damaged nuts when you have finished harvesting them.

Ask someone you trust about their personal values and beliefs.

Discuss it with your partner.
Distinguish beliefs from non-negotiables.
Make a firm list.
Revise your list often.
Learn to say “no.” One of the major reasons why people give in to their non-negotiables is that they are afraid to say “no.” Perhaps they don’t want to hurt someone’s feelings or they just don’t have the confidence to say “no.” Whatever the reason, they hurt themselves when they give in.
Let people know what your non-negotiables are.
Avoid people who can’t respect them.
Never give in.

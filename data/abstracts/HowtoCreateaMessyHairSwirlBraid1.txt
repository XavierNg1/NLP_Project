Divide the back of the hair/head into three sections.
French braid the middle section of the hair, creating a traditional French braid.
Gently pull the sides of the French braid outward, carefully grasping the entire braid chunk in each section.
Tuck the bottom of the braid or the “tail” underneath the braid and pin it into place.

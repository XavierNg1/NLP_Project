Replant your lily after the heavy frosts and rainfalls of winter are over.
Make sure your bulbs were not damaged during the winter before replanting them.
Cut away any ‘dead heads’ while the flower blooms after being replanted.
Remove the bulb in late fall to store it over winter again.
Store the bulb in a brown bag during the winter and then repeat the replanting process in the spring.

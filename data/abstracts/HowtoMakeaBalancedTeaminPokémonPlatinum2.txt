Aim for balance in your team, not just the strongest Pokémon.
Grab an Electric type Pokémon.
Make sure you snag a water type: Water Pokémon can use Ice moves and only have two weaknesses, Electric and Grass.
Have a Psychic/Dark type Pokémon.
Get a Ground, Rock or Fighting-type Pokémon.
Consider a Grass-type if you didn't start with one.
Find a Fire-type Pokémon.
Fill out any holes with good overall Pokémon that compensate for your weaknesses.
Know that having solid move sets, which are a Pokémon's four moves, are as important as choosing balanced Pokémon.

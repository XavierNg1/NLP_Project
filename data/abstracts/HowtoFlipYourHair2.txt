Start with tangle-free hair.
Pull your hair into a low ponytail.
Secure the ponytail at the nape of your neck with a hair tie.
Stick your finger up through your hair, just above the hair tie.
Grab the ponytail with your finger.
Pull the ponytail through the hole.
Smooth the flipped ponytail down, if necessary.
Consider adding a hair clip or bow just below the "flip."

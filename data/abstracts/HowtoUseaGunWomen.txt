Imagine yourself not only equal to -- but more powerful than -- an unarmed, untrained or unsuspecting attacker:


Annie Oakley, portrayed in: "Annie Get Your Gun!,
Get prepared to be safer, and able to help yourself, family and friends: Learn safety quickly at a good place to learn gun safety and rules for guns -- on Youtube, at gun stores, sporting goods stores, gun shows, gun discussion websites -- and then teach other women, daughters, sons and grandkids, how to be safe around guns -- and, possibly, to use guns effectively, because they are the more likely to become victims of physical assault and sometimes violent, sexual crimes.
Be empowered, being trained, capable of protecting others and even preserving your very physical safety and existence.
Emphasize safety: for themselves and all others around them.
Check, "Unloaded" guns shoot and kill people!",
Secure and store guns and ammunition safely for practical, safe use: Get over the initial, primal fear of the secured firearm.
Receive instruction to become comfortable with handling, loading and using firearms.
Prepare to fire a weapon.
Encourage other women to support self protection with firearms and instead of relying on the base idea or stigma that guns are bad; they will need to vote for representatives who support the Second Amendment -- or we will not be protected.

Start at an earlier age to teach your children, so the safer they will be, in gun awareness, respect and responsibility.

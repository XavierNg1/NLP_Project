Understand the basic factors involved.
Assess vehicular property damage.
Be aware that your car might be “totaled.” If repairing the damage to your vehicle would cost more than paying you for the value of your vehicle, the insurance company may consider the accident a “total loss” and pay you for the value of your car.
Understand personal injury negotiations.
Be sure to request compensation for pain and suffering if applicable.
Do not accept an offer for a settlement too soon.
Ask about policy limits.
Determine whether you live in a “no fault” state.
Talk to your insurance company if you are in a wreck with an uninsured motorist.

Be armed.
Have environmental and situational awareness.
Do anything and everything necessary for you to survive.
Don't hesitate to act.
Make sure they won't come after you.
Don't look back, just keep running till you reach safety of your home or police station.

Don't panic and start screaming, if you're in an isolated area, there's no one to hear your screams, you'll just be wasting your oxygen and tiring yourself out by doing so, save your oxygen for running.
Screaming "fire" doesn't always work.
Go to a public place (populated area).
Be honest when reporting the incident.
Immediately ask the officer to call a medic and take care of any injuries you might have sustained.

,
Avoid going through that same area next time.

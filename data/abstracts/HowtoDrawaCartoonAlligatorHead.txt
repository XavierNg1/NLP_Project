Start off your alligator with two small curves, and a slight curve between them.
Create two ovals in the middle of each of your curves.
Make a long line from the left eye, as shown in the picture above.
Make a curve at the top of the line you just finished.
Make a slight curve until you reach the end of your paper.
Whether you want to color in your alligator or not.

Start by drawing a stretched diamond shape.
Drawing parallel lines, connecting to the top and bottom ends.
Add more dominoes.
To add a falling domino piece, tilt the diamond a little.
Add another falling domino by repeating the last step.
Draw the symbols that give the pieces their values.
Use a light orange for the pieces themselves, and black ink for the dots.

Start by drawing a round circle.
Draw another two circles, one directly beneath the first one and another roughly 10–12 centimeter (3.9–4.7 in) away, toward the other side of the page, about 2 centimeter (0.8 in) higher than the 2nd circle.
Draw four curved legs coming from the lower circles.
Draw a line at the highest circle (the head).
Draw two curved lines coming from the line making the pony's back, one seeming further behind from the other.
Draw in a curved line coming from the flank, creating the tail structure.
Search for images online as to which pony you want to draw.
Erase the structural lines, and the helping lines you started out with.

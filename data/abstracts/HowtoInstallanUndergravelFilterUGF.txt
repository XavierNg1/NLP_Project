Clean the aquarium first.
Read your UGF manufacturer instructions.
Measure a length of the clear, flexible, airline tubing equal to the height of the aquarium.
Place the baseplate on the bottom of the empty aquarium.
Connect the hard, clear, plastic tube that will house the airstone and direct air bubbles upward to the water's surface to the base plate.
Carefully connect the rinsed end of the flexible plastic airline tubing to the plastic valve sticking out of the airstone.
Place the airstone in the housing tube.
Thoroughly rinse your aquarium gravel several times to remove all dust particles.
Finish rinsing and adding any aquarium decor you wish to place inside the tank.
Carefully, slowly fill the aquarium with fresh, clean, dechlorinated water.
Connect the free end of the flexible airline tubing to the air pump.
Plug in the air pump, making sure to leave a "drip-loop" of hanging cord to prevent water droplets from rolling down the electrical cord and reaching the outlet.

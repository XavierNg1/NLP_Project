Determine the working range of the metal you are going to forge or weld.
Choose a fuel for your forge.
Design the hearth and fire pit to a size suitable for the project you are going to use it for.
Choose the location where you will set up your forge.
Form up a concrete foundation for your forge.
Lay up about 24 inches (61.0Â cm) of brick on this foundation, leaving the interior hollow, like a box.
Leave an opening for the forced air supply piping either in the side or front of this box, as well.
Fashion a metal pan or fire pit liner to fit over the walls of the brick box you have laid up.
Lay your fire pit floor using fire brick or soapstone brick and mortar mixed with fire clay to withstand the high temperatures of your forge.
Lay up regular clay brick for your sides in a hearth type configuration if you like, to draft the smoke and heat away from the work ledge and fire pit.
Allow all of the masonry work to "cure" for a reasonable length of time.

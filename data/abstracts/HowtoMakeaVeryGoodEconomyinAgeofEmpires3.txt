When the game starts, only build villagers.
In the second Age, try to make the most villagers, because you need all the resources now.
Important: Think about some military too.
In the third age, start spending your resources.
Try to make some troops and upgrade the units you use.
The fourth age shouldn't be much about resources; it should be more about defense and offense.
In the fifth age, upgrade everything so you are fully equipped for a fight.
Now that you have upgraded everything, you should be ready for an attack.
Don't hesitate to spend much resources.

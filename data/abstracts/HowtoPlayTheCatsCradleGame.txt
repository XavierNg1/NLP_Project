Find a suitable piece of string.
Get another person to help you play.
Hand off the string after every turn.
Restart the game if you make a mistake.
Choose a player to start the game.
Loop the string around the back of both hands.
Wrap the string around your wrists one more time.
Catch the inner strand of the string with your middle fingers.
Turn Cat’s Cradle into “Soldier’s Bed.” The other player should now pinch the two center ‘X’s of Cat’s Cradle with the thumb and forefinger of both hands.
Transition to “Candles.” Inside the Soldier’s Bed formation, you should see two more ‘X’s in a pattern similar to Cat’s Cradle.
Make “The Manger.” From here, your partner will hook the top strand with their right pinky, then reach across from the opposite side to snag the bottom strand with their left.
Start the sequence over.

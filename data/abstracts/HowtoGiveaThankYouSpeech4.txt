Calm your nerves right before the speech.
Make eye contact with audience members.Remember not too look down at your note cards too much; just glance at them now and then to remind yourself of what you want to say.
Remember your gratitude as you're talking.
Say thoughtful words that could make people emotional and feel like "Oh this person is so thoughtful and sweet.",
Leave the stage on cue.

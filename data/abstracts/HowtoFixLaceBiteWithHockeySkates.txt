Identify whether a foot or the feet have the problem.
Try loosening the top portion of the skate but not to the point where your foot can move around inside.
Make a trip to your local skate shop: somewhere that sells only skates/hockey/figure skating equipment, they will be able to alter your boot correctly either by softening up some of the boot or by adding material such as a properly installed insole or padding.

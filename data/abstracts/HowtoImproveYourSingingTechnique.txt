Avoid damaging your vocal chords by using the diaphragm to control your breathing.
Don't use your throat, as you may strain it.
Make sure you are relaxed when you are singing.
Keep tension out of your face.
Make sure you enunciate your each and every word when you are singing.
Do not go overboard enunciating for a better and clearer sound.

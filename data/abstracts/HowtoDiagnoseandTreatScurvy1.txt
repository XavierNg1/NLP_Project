Look for more advanced signs and symptoms of scurvy.While scurvy can be hard to recognize in the early stages, it often progresses to more severe signs and symptoms if left undiagnosed and untreated.
Be aware of the risk factors for contracting scurvy.If you are displaying signs or symptoms that are suspicious for scurvy, consider whether you fall into any of the high risk categories (as this would further increase the probability that you may have scurvy).

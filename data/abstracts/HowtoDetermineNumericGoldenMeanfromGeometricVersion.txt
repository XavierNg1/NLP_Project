Use b/x = x/(b+x) instead of a:b as b:(a+b).
,
Cross-multiply to get b^2 +bx = x^2, or 0 = x^2 - bx - b^2.
Convert to the standard formula for the roots of a quadratic equation is {x1, x2} = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.

,
Substitute in our terms in the standard formula and get {x1, x2} = (-(-b) ± sqrt((-b)^2 - 4*1*-b^2)) / 2*1.
Let now b = 1 and we have {x1, x2} = (1 ± sqrt(5)) / 2 and the answers computed from this are root x1 =  1.61803399 and root x2 = -.61803399.

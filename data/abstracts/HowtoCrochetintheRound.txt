Attach your yarn to your crochet hook with a slip knot.
Crochet a chain of four stitches.
Make a slip stitch in the first chain you made, forming the four chains you made into a ring.
Insert your hook into the center of the ring.
Yarn over your hook.
Pull the loop back through center of the ring.
Yarn over once again, and this time, without going through the center of your project, pull the loop you just looped onto your hook, back through both of the strands that are already on your hook.
Continue making "Single Crochet" stitches through the center of the ring.
Insert your hook through both strands of the first stitch you made in the last round.
Yarn over your hook and pull the loop through to the front.
Yarn over your hook again, then pull the working end of the yarn through both loops you had on your hook.
Make another Single Crochet stitch in the same stitch where you just made the first single crochet of this round.
Complete the second regular round in much the same way as you completed the first regular round.
Continue increasing the number of stitches for each round until the project reaches your desired diameter.
End off your project by cutting the yarn at least 6 inches away from your last stitch, then use the hook to pull this "tail" or "end" all the way through the very last loop of the very last stitch.

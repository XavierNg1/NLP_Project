Gather materials for your project.
Make a sketch of your project to determine the size and shape of your own model.
Build a box from 1x6 foot (30cm x 180cm) softwood lumber to form the walls of your cabin.
Saw the limbs along their length.
Cut enough strips to provide enough veneer to cover the whole cabin, excluding waste (which will be considerable).
Start at the bottom on either side, and miter the ends of one of the bark slabs.
Work up the first side until the whole side is covered with the slabs.
Start the adjoining side of the box with the slabs.
Continue running slabs up the side you are currently working on until it is completely covered.
Build "rafters" with thin strips of the softwood lumber.
Erect a "ridge beam" between the "gable ends" for the rafters to fasten to, then fasten each rafter in place, measuring the distances so they are equally spaced.
,
Saw thin strips of the softwood lumber to make "shingles".
Cut the doors and windows you want in the walls, at locations you choose.
,
Trim any rough cuts or misfit joints with a sharp knife.
Seal the logs and shingles with a polyurethane sealer or varnish so the bark doesn't peel when the wood dries.

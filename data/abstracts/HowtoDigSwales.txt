Site the swales.
Attach the line to the stakes at the same distance up from the bottom.
Pound in stakes once you've found the contour for your swale.
Dig a level trench.
Get the bottom of the trench flat and level.
Begin filling the swale.
Add bulk material, like rotten wood.
Add a final cover material, like straw.
Dig more swales the same way, until you've covered the necessary area.

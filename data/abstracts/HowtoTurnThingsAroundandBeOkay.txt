Face your feelings.
Look at yourself.
Smile.
Look at happy people.
Find someone to hold you.
Cultivate habits that keep you in a good mood.
Review what has not worked for you in the past and make an effort to restrain yourself from doing it again.
Remember that no matter what, you always have a choice.
Take a look at the little things.
See the greatest thing of all.

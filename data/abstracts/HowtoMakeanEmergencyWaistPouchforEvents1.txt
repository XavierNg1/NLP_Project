Start out with a piece of fabric about three times as long as you want the pouch to be tall.
Fold the fabric right sides together, leaving the flap alone.
Cut slits a tiny bit into the edge of the flap and fold them in, pinning the new flaps in place.Flip the pouch inside out, so you can see the beautiful pattern that you chose.
Add a button or snap to keep it closed.

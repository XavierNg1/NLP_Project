Recognize the procrastinator's motto.
Remember that you don't 'have to' do anything.
Focus on starting, rather than finishing.
Break a long project down into short tasks.
Don't place too much pressure on yourself.
Stop thinking about the way things 'should' be.
Take some directed action.
Make it fun!,
Rephrase your internal dialog.

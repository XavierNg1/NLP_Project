Combine honey, water, flour, and yeast in a straight-sided container.
Cover loosely and refrigerate for 8 to 12 hours (overnight is best).

Knead the dough until you are able to gently pull it into a thin sheet that light will pass through.
While the dough is kneading, pour half of the hot water into a shallow pan and place on the bottom rack of your oven.
Grease the inside of a large straight-sided container with the vegetable oil, place the dough ball into the container, and set on the oven rack above the pan of water.
Once the dough has doubled in size, knead it into the proper texture.
Place an unglazed terra cotta dish upside-down into the oven and heat the oven to 400 °F (204 °C).
Move the dough ball to a sheet pan that has been sprinkled with the cornmeal.
Mix water and cornstarch in a small bowl and use it to brush the surface of the dough.
Gently slash the top surface of the dough ball in several places, approximately 1/3 to 1/2-inch deep.
Add more of the hot water to the shallow pan if necessary, then slide the bread onto the terra cotta dish and bake for 50 to 60 minutes.
Finished.

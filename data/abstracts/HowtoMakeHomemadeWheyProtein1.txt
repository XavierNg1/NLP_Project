Pour the milk into a large pot.
Heat the milk to 180°F (83°C).
Stir in 5 tablespoons (75 milliliters) of lemon juice.
Let the solution rest off-heat for 20 minutes.
Transfer the curdles and whey into a bowl topped with a lined strainer.
Allow the whey to drain completely from the curdles.
Use a dehydrator to process the whey, if you have one.
Process the whey by hand if you don't have a dehydrator.
Blend the dehydrated whey into a powder.
Store the protein powder in a lidded container.

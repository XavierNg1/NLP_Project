Understand the role of indefinite articles in the English language.
Memorize the rule.
Say the word out loud.
Don’t forget that acronyms work in the same way.
Remember that when a letter begins with “h” it may require “an.” Words that begin with “H” can be confusing when you’re trying to decide whether to use “a” or “an.” This is when it becomes important to remember that you are looking for a vowel ‘’’sound’’’ not just a letter that is a vowel.
Remember that “U” doesn’t always make a “U” sound.

Set the bowl out for 30-60 minutes to return to room temperature before using.
Cut the dough into 12 even pieces.
Roll out the dough lightly, forming a small disk.
Run the dough through the pasta maker on its thickest setting.
Sprinkle your fingers, the rollers, and dough with flour if it begins to stick.
Keep running the dough on thinner settings with each pass.
Pinch together any rips in the dough and run it again on the same setting.
Finish with a pass on the thinnest possible setting.
Place finished dough on parchment paper and brush with olive oil before starting on the next piece.

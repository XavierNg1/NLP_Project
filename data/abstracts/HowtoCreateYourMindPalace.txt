Find a style of music or white noise to help you enter the palace.
Decide on a rough idea of what you need it to be like physically.
Begin by building one room.
Once the "safe room" is built, work outwards.
Once you have a general picture of the inside of your palace, along with the safe room built, you can work a little on the outside.
After you have the palace pretty well started, you can begin adding information.
Begin to decide how to remember things.
If you are starting the building of your palace later in life, you will have many memories built up that you will wish to incorporate.

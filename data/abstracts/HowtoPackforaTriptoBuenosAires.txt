Create a list of what to pack for a trip to Buenos Aires.
Limit your packing to luggage you can comfortably carry.
Think of extra items you might need:


First aid kit.
Pack comfortable shoes.
Plan packing to include casual dress-up clothes, such as slacks and skirts, in addition to jeans and t-shirts.
Bring appliances and electronics that you can't live without on your trip to Buenos Aires.
Use a backpack if you want your hands free.
Use of plastic bags for packing toiletries in order to save clothing from any spills or leaks.
Split family clothing between various suitcases so, if one suitcase is lost, everyone still has clothes.

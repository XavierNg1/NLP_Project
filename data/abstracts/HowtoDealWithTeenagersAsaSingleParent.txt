Engage any support network, friends, or family you may have.
Ask sisters, brothers, and grandparents to call and check in on your child if he/she is home alone.
Talk to your child about the fact that you can’t be there all the time and let them know what you expect.
Give your child chores to do to earn money or to earn favors (like going out with friends on a Saturday night) to keep them busy while you are gone.
Know your child’s friends.
Listen and pay attention to your teen.
Above all, make time to talk to your child and do things together when you are home.
Try to understand the root cause behind any irrational behavior of your child, rather than losing temper.

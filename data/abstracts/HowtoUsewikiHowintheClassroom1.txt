Explain the concept of the wiki to students before you begin.
Ask students to choose two wikiHow articles to critique.
Once the class has established what makes a good wikiHow article, it's time for students to start brainstorming possible topics for their own article.
Once possible topics have been approved, students need to test their topics for originality.
To begin, each student should create an account on the wikiHow web site; the instructions are very easy to follow.
When students have established an approved topic, they will type in the title for their wikiHow article.

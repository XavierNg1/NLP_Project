Warm up with a short walk or run before doing the tests.
Place a 12 inch-high (30.4 cm) box (or something with similar measurements) at your feet with a wall behind you.
Sit on the ground with your back against the wall and feet hip-width apart in front of you.
Sit up straight, place your arms out in front of you and stack your hands, 1 on top of the other.
Bend forward and gently reach your hands toward the yardstick.
Measure the tips of your fingers when you reach forward.

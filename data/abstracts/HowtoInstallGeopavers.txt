Plan your project requirements.
Select the geopavers you'll use for your project.
Determine the size of the area you'll be paving.
Order the materials from the appropriate suppliers in your area.
Clear the area for the installation.
Grade the subgrade area to a depth of about 12 inches (30.4cm) below the finished elevation of the pavement.
Compact the subgrade material and then add the base material, grading it to the elevation your project requires.

Install the setting bed of graded, clean concrete sand.

Set a paver on the edge of the area where your layout begins, and ease it into place.

Tap the paver with a heavy rubber mallet to set it in the sand, then place the next paver on its edge adjacent to the first.

Begin the next row of pavers.

Cut any pavers that do not fit correctly, so the individual lines of pavers remain true.

Cut any pavers along the edges if they don't accurately fit the footprint of your paving project, or if radius edges or other out-of square shapes are used.
,
Inspect the levelness and trueness of the pavers when you've finished laying them.

Fill the pavers with the material you choose for this purpose.
Clean up.

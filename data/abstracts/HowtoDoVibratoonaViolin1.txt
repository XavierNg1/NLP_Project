Begin practicing vibrato only after you are fairly comfortable with your finger placement and have memorized all of your notes' positions.
Understand how your wrist is supposed to move as you vibrato.
As you hold your left hand in this fashion, imagine that someone is holding a pencil just centimeters away from the side of your hand.
Try it with your instrument.
Keep in mind that your finger should never slide on the string.
Try bowing the string that your vibrating finger is on.
Move very slowly when learning, to develop muscle memory.
Practice this slowly until you feel very comfortable.

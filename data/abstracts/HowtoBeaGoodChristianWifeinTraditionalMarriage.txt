Be secure in yourself through keeping Christ's Spirit in your marriage.
Choose joy in your married life: J.O.Y.
Learn to pray fervently and effectively.
You can have a long, happy Relationship by being cheerful, positive and confident with the husband, if he is "thoughtful".
Imagine: "What if your husband is gone tomorrow?",
Express your needs clearly, but don't accuse each other.
Don't expect him to give you your dreams.
Share the cooking and house chores as much as possible, especially if both work outside the home.
Pick your battles.
Encourage your husband in the Lord: that he is to do as The Bible says: "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave his life for it.",
Help him to feel comfortable in showing simple verbal and courteous affection without it always leading to sex: begin this helpful guidance in public with public praise for courtesy and kindness by showing that you are thrilled by that attention; smile, slightly giggle and say something like "flattery will get you everywhere," and try "playing tag" sometimes, or playing "keep away;" having fun--and being alluring and a little bit coy when there is no chance of going too far, ie: in front of his in-laws, at the store, and such.
Keep your sex life interesting, but if something feels demeaning, do not fail to explain how it made you feel.
Accept him and especially his little mannerisms and habits.
Be modest in public: as such a woman is a lady.
Always be quick to forgive, quick to repent and quick to believe:

Quick to forgive.
See the best in your husband and in life.

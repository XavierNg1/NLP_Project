Take over-the-counter painkillers.To manage the pain of your sore throat and also to control fever, your best bet is to take Acetaminophen (Tylenol), which is available over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or drugstore.
Use throat lozenges.Another way to help control the pain of a sore throat is to purchase lozenges â€” these can often be found at either a grocery store or a pharmacy.
Drink plenty of fluids.Anytime your body is in the midst of fighting off an infection, you become more prone than normal to dehydration.
Ask for a prescription for Penicillin.Penicillin is usually the antibiotic of choice in the treatment of streptococcal infections (the bacteria responsible for scarlet fever).
Understand the risk of developing long-term complications from scarlet fever.The most important reason to receive antibiotics is not to treat the initial infection, but rather, to prevent serious complications from developing down the road.

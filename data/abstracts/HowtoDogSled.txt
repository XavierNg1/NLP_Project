Teach your dog to wear a sled dog harness: first, let him sniff and touch it, for some days.Tie a thick rope to the dog harness and on a climbing harness you will wear

,
Go out and teach your dog the basicsÂ : you will be jogging, and your goal is to teach the dog this is not a normal walk: he does not have to walk slowly, stop often to sniff around, pee and so on, but to run with you and never stop all time long.
When the dog runs faster than you, being in front of you, praise him and run faster yourself to encourage this behaviour.

,
Commands: always say "GO" when you start, and "WHOA" in the end, when you stop.
Start off adjusting your speed and the duration of your training session to your dog's physical condition: you might want to start by just walking for a few minutes.
Be patient: bear in mind you do not train a dog for sled dog in a few days, but it takes at least a year ( for an athletic dog, already fit and well muscled when starting )

,
Pulling: when the dog will learn it is about always running in front of you, faster than you, start slowing down and making your dog feel your weight.
Biking: tie your dog to your bike, and encourage him to run, pulling, in front of you as usual.
Sledding: for this step, seek help from a professional sled dog trainer.
Why: your dog will probably enjoy sled dog, IF it is not physically too heavy for him: nobody would ever enjoy something that leaves you with all your muscles sore and weak legs!,
How:


first of all, have your vet do a check up of your dog's condition: you need your vet approval before starting.

Note that the effectiveness of treating (and curing) breast cancer depends on how early it is detected.In some ways, the best form of "treatment" is prevention.
Follow through with all screening tests.Women are advised to receive a mammogram every two years from the age of 50 onwards.This is a specialized form of x-ray that can detect abnormalities in the breast.
Receive genetic testing if you have a family history of breast cancer.If you have a family history of breast cancer, and the affected family member tests positive for the BRCA gene, you are also advised to be tested for the presence of this gene.

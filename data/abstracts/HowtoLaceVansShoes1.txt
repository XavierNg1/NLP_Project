Count the number of eyelet pairs on your shoe.
Insert each end of the shoelace downward through one of the bottom two eyelets.
Feed the right lace underneath the shoe so that it pops out of the second eyelet on the right side.
Feed the left lace underneath the shoe.
Cross the right lace over to the left side and insert it downward through the second eyelet.
Cross the lace emerging from the third eyelet to the right side.
Continue repeating this pattern.

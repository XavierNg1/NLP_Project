Wash and dry your hair.
Leaving most of your hair loose, take a piece of hair from the left side and right side of your head, in order to make a small ponytail over the top of the rest of your hair.
Tease the ponytail part only.
Make another ponytail using the remaining hair that is still loose.
Take the long, bottom ponytail and bring it up and over the top ponytail.
Tuck the end of the long ponytail inside the loop of hair that this action has created.
Spray with hairspray.
Add hair ornaments after your chignon is completed.

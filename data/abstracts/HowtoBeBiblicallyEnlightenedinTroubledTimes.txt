Center your life around Jesus Christ.
Admit to Jesus that you are in need of His help.
Recognize that your situation will change.
Realize that our afflictions are about Him.
Note that it is often times those difficult moments in life that lead the sufferer to come closer to Him and into His hands.
Understand, that God is wisdom.
Look back and record every memorable moment of your lifetime that you may recall.
Feel loved.
Rejoice!,
Just be.

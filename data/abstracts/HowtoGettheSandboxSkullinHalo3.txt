Begin a Forge session on the Sandbox map.
Enter editor mode (or oracle form) by pressing UP on the D-Pad once you have begun play.
Locate the area of the map where the skull is located.
Dodge the guardian's attacks in editor mode by using the thrust (pressing and holding the Left Trigger) and moving in vertical and horizontal lines once you have passed the boundary of the map.
Decide which method of getting to the Sandbox skull you wish to use, as there are many.
Change from editor mode back into player form (if you are not in it already) by pressing UP on the D-Pad again and pick up the skull by pressing the Right Bunker when prompted.
Check your Xbox 360 gamerscore and achievement statistics and you will see that the Sandbox Skull achievement has been unlocked for 25 gamerscore.

Prepare a plastic seedling tray or small pots.
Fill your containers with well-draining growing medium.
Scatter the seeds over the growing medium.
Cover the seeds with soil.
Fill a wide tray or bin with stones and water.
Sit the seedling tray on top of the stones.
Spray the soil with water from above once every three days.
Place the entire structure over a heating pad set to low.
Cease above-soil watering once the seeds germinate into seedlings.
Transplant the seedlings into more permanent containers.

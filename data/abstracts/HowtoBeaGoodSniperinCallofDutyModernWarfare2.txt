Choose your sniper rifle.
Choose your attachments.
Choose your perks.
The most important thing is to find the correct place.
Aim for the torso, the torso is easily the largest part of the body.
Aim for the head.
Lead them with the scope.
Those are the two most important things to remember.
Do not stay in one place "hard-scoped" in.
After a few kills or so (especially if using a non-silenced rifle on a core game) change to a new position, usually one where you can clearly see your last position to kill those who still believe you are in that position.

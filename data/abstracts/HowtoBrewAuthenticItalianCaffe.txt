Invest in an inexpensive stove-top espresso maker, namely, the "macchinetta".
Take a quick look at the machinetta.
Note that in most macchinettas, the Top Chamber, Central Column and Filter Plate are combined in one piece, the Funnel Filter is a separate piece, and the Steam Release Valve and Bottom Chamber are combined in one piece.

,
Use excellent quality coffee grounds.
Fill the bottom chamber up to the steam release valve with cold water.

,
Insert the funnel filter.
Once the water is at the appropriate level and the funnel filter has been inserted, fill the funnel with your coffee grounds.
Take the upper part of the machinetta and turn it upside down and inspect the filter and gasket.
Place the macchinetta on the stove top.
Wait.
Allow the process to complete.

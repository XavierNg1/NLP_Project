Determine your young athlete's favorite healthy foods.
When you shop, look for the favorite items in bulk or on sale.
If time is a factor — and it is for most busy sports families — cook several extra portions and freeze in meal-size packets or plan to consume a couple of times over the following few days.
If your athlete drinks milk, consider purchasing whole milk.
For snacks on the go, use transportable fruit, granola, trail mix, or meat jerky.
Keep in mind that the more variety in the diet, the healthier it will be.
Avoid processed "combination" foods.
Cook the items your athlete likes simply.

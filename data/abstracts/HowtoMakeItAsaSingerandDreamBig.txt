It takes effort and determination to make it as a star, and you may have to put in commitment and hard work.
But of course, you have to be confident!,
If you think you're good at singing or playing an instrument and you have a YouTube account, you could upload videos of you performing your talent.
Try to get into talent shows or school concerts so others can see your talents live.
Have a go at writing your own lyrics.
Listen to your favorite music!,
Search on YouTube for anything and you might find new talents you love too!

,
Practise, practise practise!,
Use your own fashion sense, not dressing one way because someone else tells you too.
Try your best at all times and believe in your dreams.

This article relies on the previous accomplishment of the five articles preceding it:

How to Create Artistic Patterns in Microsoft Excel
How to Create a Flower Pattern in Microsoft Excel
How to Create a Tornado Screw Pattern in Microsoft Excel

How to Create a Uniform Spiral Pattern in Microsoft Excel, and

How to Create an Insectoid Pattern in Microsoft Excel.
Please complete those before attempting this one.
Set Defined Variables, Formats for Values and Formulas that have changed since How to Create an Insectoid Pattern in Microsoft Excel and verify those that haven't changed:

On=0 Off=1 is set to 1 (no change).
Set column Formulas that have changed since "Create Special Designs and Patterns 05" and verify those that haven't changed:

A7:A1447'a formulas remain the same.
Note: In column L, with the column header in cell L6 of TT, is the data series for L7:L1447 of 0 to 2*PI() but I don't have any dependents for it under audit, so it's currently useless.
The Lookup Tables remain the same, though their locations may have changed somewhat.
For those readers who completed the article Create a Pink Love Note of Spheres in Form of a Heart, copy cells from that worksheet's cell range Z2:AF1447 and paste them to the current Data sheet's cell range U1:AA1446 as a means of saving tons of time.
Otherwise, enter the following column headings in row 6: U6: Ball#; V6: H; W6: K; X6: X; Y6: Y; Z6: Radius; AA6: FFF.

Allowing for scratches, and dynamics, with proper array formulation, each ball can be made to move as it should, in theory.
Create the above graphic using this series:

=SERIES(,Data!$F$7:$F$1447,Data!$G$7:$G$1447,1)

,

=SERIES(,Data!$X$7:$X$1446,Data!$Y$7:$Y$1446,1)

Figure out your overall personality: Do you consider yourself artsy?,
Take a good look at your wardrobe.
Go shopping!,
Some basics to buy: Khakis, black pants, nice jeans, three or four fitted shirts in your favorite color, two good pairs of shoes (low heels or dress shoes), one or two jackets or blazers, a good watch.
Don't be afraid to experiment.
Avoid anything too fancy.
Get a nice haircut.
Choose natural, light, and pretty makeup.
If want tattoos or body piercings, don't go for the giant dragon on your face.

Decide what you want to draw.
Sketch the exact scene as you see it in your mind.
Look back to your sketch.
Close your eyes.
Paint the scene.
Paint more heavily over the darker parts and less on the lighter parts.
Once you've painted the main colours, begin to add shade and texture.
Add any main details that complete the objects, animals, people and plants.
Stand back and observe the painted scene now and then.
Celebrate when it's finished.

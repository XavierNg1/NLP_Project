Consider your network is having Aggregation, Core, Access, Network Processor engine, and Route reflector Routers;
,
Assume that All the L3 Layer connectivity is established between all these devices.
Assume that you have 2 Route Reflector name RR1 and RR2 in your network.

,
Assume that you have 22 Aggregation Routers (AG1 to AG22).

,
Assume that you have 4 network processor engine (NPE1 to NPE4).
In both of your Route Reflectors configure all your Aggregation, Network Processor engine routers as your bgp neighbors.

,
Now log in to each devices other than route reflectors (AGG,NPE) and make bgp neighbor as the Route Reflector.

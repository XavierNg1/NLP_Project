Tie your sabiki rig to your line, and weight the opposite end of the sabiki with a small diamond jig lure.

Cast your line as far as you can into the harbor, and then reel your line in slowly.
When you get a bite, stop jigging and simply reel in your line at an even, steady pace.

If you don't catch a fish on the first cast, don't worry!

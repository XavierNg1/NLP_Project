Buy yourself a new notebook.
Write down the outline.
Spend a measly forty-five minutes on this book every day.
When you do feel like writing write out one chapter.
Once you have typed out every chapter email it to all your friends.
Print out your book after you have added or taken away things due to your friends recommendations.
Read through it one more time this time checking for grammar, spelling, better vocab that could be used, punctuation, etc.
Send it out to the publishing houses!

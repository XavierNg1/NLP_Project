Save 2 to 4 cereal boxes, or the equivalent in other thin cardboard material.
Choose some scrapbooking or wrapping paper in a pretty pattern.
Spray a layer of spray glue over outside of the cereal box.
Allow the glue to dry according to package directions.
Flip the cardboard over so that the plain cardboard back is showing.
Place the container lid on top of the cardboard and trace 2 connecting circles onto the cardboard.
Cut the shape out of the cardboard.
Trace a small round shape, about the size of a large milk cap or juice cap at the top of the round dividers.
Cut a sharp angle from the bottom side of the divider up toward the small circle.
Write the names of the types of clothing onto your dividers using permanent marker.

Purchase brown or white rice, depending on the type of flour you want to make.
Purchase a blender or mixer that cracks grains.
Fill the container with 1 to 4 cups (240 mL to 960 mL) of rice.
Mix the rice until the flour consistency is one you like.
Use the resulting rice flour in gluten-free recipes.
Store any remaining rice flour in an air-tight container until you are ready to use it again.

Figure out your own motives.
Be aware that each of the above motivations are relevant - and each requires a different game plan.
If you are investing, then you must do your homework and build contacts in the art world, that you can trust.
Know that rarity equals value as well as quality.
Understand the smaller the edition, the higher the price.
Do your research.
Educate yourself.
Develop your art taste buds by looking at lots of art, and hone your appreciation for the aesthetics.
Develop an understanding of the artists.
Choose the art that's right for you.
Go out and view lots of artworks.
Talk your own language.
You don't need to spend a lot of money.
Above all, don't rush.
Find a dealer that you can trust.
Avoid salespeople.
Also remember that a dealer who trusts their own choices won't refer to an artwork's price history as their primary justification.

,
An artwork's price history on its own is no guarantee of anything, and will only give you other people's (possibly inaccurate) predictions.

,
Get the price right.
Ask your dealer if you can exchange the work in the future.
Build a relationship with the auction house.
Observe, listen, learn and ask questions.
Remember, a collector should be as passionate about the work as the artist; which can require you to be very passionate indeed.

,
Bear in mind the hidden costs.
Also remember that, with art, you are buying objects that have a life of their own.
Avoid the biggest mistake a collector can make; not being informed enough!,
Be warned that if you treat art like a commodity, you will end up with stocks or certificates on your wall.
Equip yourself with a knowledge of art history, the history of the markets, and the current art scene.
Above all, ensure that you amass a collection that you will love and can live with (potentially) for the rest of your life.

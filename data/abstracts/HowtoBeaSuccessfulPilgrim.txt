Feel as if God wants you to undertake this journey and remain eager to see the temple.
Book a flight after checking the timings of the place of worship.
Book a hotel room if you find you need to stay more than a day.Choose wisely- remember you are visiting a holy town for a day or two, you don't really need a swimming pool and a spa during that period.
Be prepared to withstand physical strain.
Safeguard your money.
Be aware about technology.
Get in the right mood.
Buy yourself a souvenir or a book that narrates the legend of the town and the deity, to share with folks back home.

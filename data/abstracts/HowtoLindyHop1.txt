Start with a firm frame.
Stand close together, but not so close that you're going to trip over each other.
Have the lead place their right hand on the follow's left shoulder blade.
Have the follows put their left arm over the lead's right arm, and position it so that there is as much contact between the two arms as possible.
Hold your partner's other hand when the move requires it.
Maintain a 'pulse' for any move you do in the Lindy Hop.

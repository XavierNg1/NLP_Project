Put the clean, seedless cherries and sugar in a saucepan.
Cover the pan and leave at room temperature for 2 hours.
Add the 1/2 pint of water and stir until all the sugar dissolves.
Bring the contents up to a boil.
When finished, strain the mixture.
Simmer the strained liquid until it thickens like maple syrup.
To serve this drink, put one or two spoons of it into a glass of soda water.

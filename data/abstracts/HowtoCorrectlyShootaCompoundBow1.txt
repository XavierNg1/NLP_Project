Start with your feet shoulder-width apart, at a right angle to your target.
Grip the bow so the weight balances in the space between your thumb and fingers.
Notch an arrow into the rest, then snap it into the notch.
Attach your mechanical release to the bowstring where the arrow attaches.
Keep your eyes on the target and your chin parallel to the ground.
Understand your aiming sight helps you determine arrow distance.

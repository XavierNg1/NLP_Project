Try to be objective.
Realize that people lie, cheat, and misuse their resources.
Press is not a window to the world.
Nature and mankind coexist in a symbiosis.
Every great person began their life like any one of us.
Accept, that there are things you don't know.
Observe your human rights.
Be honest to avoid unnecessary or embarrassing situations.
Make a distinction between things!,
People do things in the spirit of doing something good.
If you are not sure about how well you respond to situations in life, or if you can't decide that your way of life is good or bad, try magnifying it.
There is good in this world.
Realize that not everyone who is impatient is trying to anger you.

Divide your room into zones.
Work on one zone at a time, deep cleaning each one.
Sleep Zone: This zone is easy to clean and organize.
Clothes Zone: This isn't as easy as the sleep zone.
Get Ready Zone:


If you have a bathroom in your room, then that would be your get ready zone.
Relaxation Zone: Decide what relaxation means for you.
Work Zone: If you're a preteen or teenager, you will probably have a work area so that you can do homework.
When you think you're done, do one last check.

Start off asking the standard easy questions that any reference check should have:


When did Mike work at your company and what did he do?,
Continue asking more standard questions, but be sure to ask the "obvious" things that you think you already know about:


Did Mike report directly to you for his entire time at the company?,
Proceed into hard questions.

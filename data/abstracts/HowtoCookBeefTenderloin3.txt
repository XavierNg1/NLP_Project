Start with a long piece of butcher's twine.
Bring your string under one side of the roast and drape the string over the top of the meat.

,
Tie a butcher's knot.
With the remaining string, make a large loop with your hand.
Wrap the loop under the tenderloin and tighten about an inch from the last loop.
Make another loop with your hand and continue the process of looping and tying off.
Flip the tenderloin over once the entire top side is trussed.

,
Going the opposite direction with your twine you went on the top side, start feeding the twine under and then over each loop.
Wrap the twine under, then over and under again, until each loop has been tied off.

Finish with a butcher's knot on the top side of the tenderloin.

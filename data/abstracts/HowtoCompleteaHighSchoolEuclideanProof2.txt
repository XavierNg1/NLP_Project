Draw a diagram.
State the theorem.
Set up the format for a two column proof.
Repeat each of the givens for the first few rows of the proof.
Aim towards the first important intermediate result you found in the preparation stage.
If the reason is a theorem, be sure to specify which one and why it applies.
If a theorem has conditions attached to it, you should explicitly show how they are satisfied.
Continue working towards your conclusion by establishing the other key intermediate steps you found in the prep work.
The last line of the proof should be the desired conclusion.
Optionally, terminate the proof with QED, a box, or some other similar mark.

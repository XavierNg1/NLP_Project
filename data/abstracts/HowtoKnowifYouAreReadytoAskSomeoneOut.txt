Think it over.
Get to know this person.
How much do you like them?,
Consider how you'll cope if rejected.
Consider what you'll do if the answer is "yes".
How are you going to ask out your prospective date?,
Make sure that you don't walk up to them and hesitate, and make sure you don't do it somewhere where it would not be appropriate for them to kiss you (IE: a school dance would be a great place).

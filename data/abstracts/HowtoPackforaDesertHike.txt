Determine the type of desert you will be hiking in.
Leave your itinerary with someone you trust.
Find, fill, and pack water bottles in large quantities.
Wear and pack clothing with the following characteristics:


light-weight - you need to allow your skin to breathe and release moisture (sweat)
light-colored - this will help reflect some light and keep you cooler
long-sleeved - particularly for multi-day trips, sun exposure can be fatal; if it's light-weight and lightly-colored, you should be OK

,
Choose a light, but well-insulated sleeping bag if you plan to stay overnight.
Pack navigational aides:



GPS unit (the easy way, but it can run out of battery power)

Compass (the hard way, but more reliable to work properly)

Map of your final destination, camping location, set-off/arrival point, etc.
Bring energy-rich, high-protein food.
Remember the daily essentials like:



Sunblock (the highest SPF you can find, preferably sweat-proof)
Toothbrush
Toothpaste
Toilet paper
Washcloth
Sunglasses
Head covering (a wide-brimmed hat that goes around the entire head is best; baseball caps leave the neck completely exposed)
Neck covering, such as a handkerchief
Hand towel

Gloves (for rocky, mountain terrain)
Multi-functional knife

Small first-aid kit

,
Zip up your backpack securely to ensure that no items fall out.
Wear your backpack high on your back so that the top is nearly touching the base of your neck.
Consider a bear canister.

Access your credit report to determine whether you need to make changes or improvements prior to attempting to access your home's equity.
It's always best to consult with a loan officer before paying off any collections or charge offs.
Compile a thorough list of all debts, such as credit cards and car loans, as well as any debt to be incurred, such as funds needed for home improvements or college tuition.

,
Add all of the debts into one lump sum.

,
This is the amount of "cash out" you will need.

,
Ask your loan officer for an estimate of your home's current market value.
Refer to your most recent loan statement and add the balance of your mortgage to the amount you wish to borrow.

,
Divide this total by the value of your home to determine your Loan to Value Ratio (LTV).
The CLTV may vary slightly from lender to lender, but often needs to be lower than 80%.

,
Consider your options for accessing home equity.
Base your decision on the interest rate of the refinancing option, as well as total monthly payments.

,
If it is more than 1% lower than your existing loan, this is probably the best choice.

,
Choose the home equity loan if you're seeking a smaller amount of funds.

,
Consider a line of credit, based on your equity, which works much like a credit card.
Request quotes from several competing banks.
Compare the loan options regarding: amount of payment, length of loan, interest rates, and any additional fees.

,
Decide which loan is best suited for your needs and your budget.
Inform the bank you have chosen that you'd like to move forward with your application.
Complete and sign the application, attach the necessary updated paperwork, and return it.

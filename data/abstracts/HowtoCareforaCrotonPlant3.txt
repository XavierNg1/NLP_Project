Fertilize croton plants every four weeks during the spring, summer and early fall.
Pour the solution evenly over the potting soil immediately after watering with plain water.
Repot crotons in the spring if they have outgrown their containers.
Make sure the new container has drain holes in the bottom, then add soil.

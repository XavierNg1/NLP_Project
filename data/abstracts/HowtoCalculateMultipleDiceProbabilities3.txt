Note the probabilities of the outcomes of a single die.
In the column for 2 dice, use the formula shown.
Likewise, for three or more dice, the same formula still applies, using the now known probabilities for each given sum on one die fewer.
The spreadsheet shown computed "number of ways" not "probability", but converting between them is easy: probability = number of ways / r^n where r is number of sides on each die and n is the number of dice.

Buy a bag of grapes attached with a decent length of vine.
Find a vine with grapes on it.
Remove the grapes from the vine until there is only the vine left.
Cut off the rotten or dried out parts of the vine.
Fill a clear plastic cup with water.
Fill a planting pot with dirt.
Keep the growing vine watered so that the soil is moist but not water logged.
Transfer your new grapevine when it appears large enough to place in the garden or a larger container.
Keep growing it and in a few months, you just might be able to eat the grapes!

Cut a hole in your material where you want the eyelet to go.

Use a pad under the cloth to make a clean cut.

To cut the hole always put the pad under the "bad side" of the cloth.

Push the eyelet through the hole you have made.

Tuck any loose threads under the flat part of the eyelet so they are not visible.

Align your eyelet pliers.

Squeeze the pliers together.

Take the pliers away and check that the eyelet is set as you want it.

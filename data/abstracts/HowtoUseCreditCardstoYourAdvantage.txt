Consider how the credit card will be used.
Don't apply for too many credit cards.
Resist the urge to open individual store accounts, even though the merchant may tempt you with a discount on your purchase.
Look for cards with rewards that will be meaningful to you.
Make sure your credit card offers a grace period; the longer, the better.
Hang onto your receipts and reconcile them with your statement promptly.
Stay off the interest train.
Watch out for cash advances.
Don't view your credit card as a magic plastic wand.
If you must charge a large purchase to your card that you will not be able to pay for in full when the bill comes, stop using the card until the balance is paid off.

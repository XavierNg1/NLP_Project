Consider the hamster’s breed.
Keep an eye on young hamsters.
Don’t over-handle newly weaned hamsters.
Be aware of gastrointestinal disturbances.Adult hamsters tend to develop the symptoms if the balance of microorganisms in their guts is disturbed.
Take the hamster’s other conditions into consideration.It may well be that the gastrointestinal problems arise not from disturbances like stress or diet, but from an underlying medical condition.

Begin with a clean, perfectly smooth wood surface and a clean, dust-free, warm room.
Mix 3 ounces of shellac flakes with 1 pint of denatured alcohol.
Soak a wad of gauze in shellac, then place it inside a cotton cloth (a piece of an old bed sheet or white tee-shirt works well).
Add a few drops of olive oil to the pad.
Apply the shellac to the wood surface in a gliding or sweeping motion, working one small area at a time, perhaps 2 square feet.
Build a fresh pad, then add a few drops shellac and several drops of alcohol to the cloth.
Allow the work to sit for a couple of hours so any oil can come to the surface.
Let the work sit for several hours so it can dry completely, then repeat the boding, stiffing and spiriting sessions.
Polish the surface with rottenstone and olive oil.
Finish with a thin coat of furniture wax to help protect your French polish from damage.

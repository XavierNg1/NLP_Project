In early June, buy yourself some pre-fertilized potting soil.
Fill a small paper cup with enough of the soil to fill to just below the rim.
Fill a 5 gallon (18.9Â L) bucket with holes drilled in the bottom with the soil.
Water your plant until the soil is completely saturated and water only when the soil becomes dry to the touch.
Keep an eye on it.
Be patient.
Cut the plant at the bottom and place in a warm, dry, well-ventilated area.
Making sure the buds are completely dry, store them in mason jars for storage and place in a cool dark area.

Get a lot of sleep and rest.
Drink LOTS of H2O (water!).
Keep your hands, fingers, hair, jewelry, clothing, that carrot you dropped on the ground, etc.
Wash your hands often, especially after toilet trouble, dirty jobs and messes, before/after meals, after coughing and/or sneezing and/or bowing your nose 'till your brains come out.
Try not to have anyone else (like a friend or relative) sleep in the same bed as you normally sleep in, or at least on the side you sleep on.
Eat healthy.
Take vitamins and minerals; especially Vitamin C and D. C is for many things, including the immune-system, and Vitamin D focuses just about everything on your immune system.
Get good exercise!

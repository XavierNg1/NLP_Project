First find out if the person you like is single or not.
If they have never spoken to you before, it's best to introduce yourself first!,
Get to know the person just a little better before you get too worked up about them - you never know, you might dislike them once you know them better!,
Show an interest in this person.
Talk to him/her regularly.
Flirt with them but leave a sense of mystery!,
Get to know his friends - (but not too well!),
Make an effort to talk about things he likes, and loves.
Lastly, be yourself!

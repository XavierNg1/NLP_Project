Build sod houses in September, when the roots of the grass are deepest.
Find a location that's fairly level in an area that's covered with thick prairie grass, such as buffalo grass.
Dig up the sod inside the marked area, rake the dirt until it's smooth and level and tamp it down as much as you can.
Mow the grass to a height of 4 inches.

,
Slice the sod into 2-foot (61 cm) strips.
Cut the strips across at 1-foot (30 cm) intervals.
Lay 1 row of bricks on the ground, grass-side down.
Lay the second row of sod bricks on top the first.
Add subsequent rows of bricks over the first rows.
Lay sod brick until your walls reach the bottom of where you want your windows.
Continue building the walls around the window and door frames.
Construct a roof for your sod house.
Cover the roof with sod.
Install the doors and windows.

,
Suspend a muslin sheet to the roof inside the house to form a sort of ceiling that will catch any dirt or water that falls from the roof.

,
Fill any spaces remaining in the walls with additional sod or grass.

,
Smooth the inside of the walls and whitewash them.

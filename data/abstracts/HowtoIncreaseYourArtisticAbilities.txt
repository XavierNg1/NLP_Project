The first thing you need to do is realize that inspiration is art.

Research the different types of art there are.

Figure out your "niche" in art.

Go to art shows, museums, or even just the art rooms at your school and look at all the art that people create.

Realize that art is not relegated only to plastic arts (art in which material is used to create a tangible thing).

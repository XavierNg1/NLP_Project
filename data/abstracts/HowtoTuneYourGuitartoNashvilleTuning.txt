Go to you local music store and buy some single strings, or a set of strings for a 12 string acoustic.
Detach and replace the old strings, one by one.
Start putting on strings starting with the first or High E string.
Tune first two strings (E,B) as you would normally.
Play your guitar as you always did but it now sounds like something you've never heard before.

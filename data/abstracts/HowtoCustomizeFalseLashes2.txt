Get two pairs of false "wispy" eyelashes.
Spread the hairs out on the outer corner of the first pair of lashes.
Place your altered lashes back on their tray.
Draw a thin line of eyelash glue right under the lash strip.
Place the second pair of lashed on top.
Wait for the glue to dry before using the lashes.

Build a framework to hang the sheetrock from.
Install electrical outlets and fixtures before you begin with your sheetrock.
Hang sheetrock on the framework using 4 x 8-foot (1.2 X 2.4 m) sheets.
Mark the sheetrock to the width you need.
Tape and embed the walls to your new basement room.
Complete the walls by using a sanding block and sandpaper to sand down and blend in the edges of the embedment.

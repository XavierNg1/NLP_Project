Place 1 pound of wax in a slow cooker.
Add a few drops of liquid candle scent to the melted wax.
Put on a pair of rubber gloves.
Use tongs to dip a bear into the wax.
Lift the bear from the wax with tongs.
Hold the bear with the tongs until the wax is cool enough to not burn your hands through the gloves.
Use a wire bristle comb to fluff the fur on the bear.Set the bear on a cookie sheet until the wax cools and sets.Add embellishments like a ribbon bow around the neck or ears.
Tie a printed tag to the wax-coated bear.
Wrap the bear in cellophane to preserve the scent if you are giving it as a gift or selling it at a craft show.

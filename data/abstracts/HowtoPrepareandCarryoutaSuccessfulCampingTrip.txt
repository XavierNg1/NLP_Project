Decide whom you are going with, and where the campsite will be.
Bring the right equipment.
Bring the correct clothing.
Once you have decided what equipment is needed, plan out what meals you want to have on your camping trip.
When arriving to the campsite, start by unloading the car at the actual site (if possible) for maximum convenience.
Leave it the way you left it.
Talk with everyone about how the camping trip went after the trip.

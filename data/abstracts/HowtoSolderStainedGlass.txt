Place the glass on a towel upon a hard surface.
Score the glass.
Break the glass along the score line.
Create your desired shapes.
Prepare your soldering materials.
Cut a piece of copper foil that will wrap around the edge of the glass you want to solder.
Remove the backing from the strip of adhesive foil.
Place the adhesive side of the copper foil on the edge of the piece of glass.
Fold the excess copper foil onto the face of the glass.
Firmly run a pencil over all areas where the foil touches the glass.
Repeat these steps with the other piece of glass that you are going to solder.

,
Brush a coating of liquid flux onto the copper foil on both pieces.
Position your glass pieces for soldering.
Unroll about 4" of solder from the coil.
Hold the coil of solder in your left hand and the soldering iron in your right hand.
Place the tip of the unrolled solder near the copper foil, but without touching it.
Touch the tip of the soldering iron to the tip of the unrolled solder.
Steadily move both hands along the line of intersection, between the two pieces of glass.
Remove the tip of the soldering iron from the solder once you have reached the end of the seam.
Repeat these steps to add each additional piece of glass to your project.

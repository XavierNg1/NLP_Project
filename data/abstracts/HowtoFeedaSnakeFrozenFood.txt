Thaw the rodent in a bowl of warm water.
Take the mouse out of the bowl when the timer goes off.
Put the snake in its feeding area.
Place the rodent in the area with the snake.
If your snake is a picky eater, or has not eaten dead food before, you may have to work a little harder at it at first.
Put the snake back in its enclosure and let it digest its meal in a warm dark area.

Understand the process of shielded Metal Arc Welding.
Learn the steps for creating a successful weld.
Gather the tools and materials you will need to begin welding.
Set up a safe work area, preferably with a table constructed of steel or other non-flammable material.
Prepare the metal to be welded.
Attach clamps to hold your metal pieces together, if need.
Attach the ground clamp to the larger piece of stock that is being welded.
Select the correct rod and amperage range for the work you are attempting.
Turn on your welding machine.
Hold the stinger in your dominant hand by the insulated handle, with the rod in a position so that striking the tip of it against the plate you are welding will be as natural a movement as possible.
Select the point where you wish to begin your weld.
Strike the electrode against the surface of the metal, pulling it back slightly when you see an electric arc occur.
Practice traveling across the path of your weld with the electrode until you can keep a consistent arc, moving at a consistent speed, and in line with the path you want to weld.
Keep the arc established as you move along the weld you are making.
Practice moving the electrode in a sweeping motion to create a wider bead.
Adjust your welder's output amperage to suit the material you are welding and the desired penetration of the arc.
Clean your finished weld.
Paint your weld with a suitable rust-preventative primer to protect it from corrosion.

Set up your area.
Arrange the rest of the equipment for easy access.
Before you make a bead, prepare the mandrels.
If a powdered bead release is to be used, mix it according to the manufacturer's instructions.
When dry, check each mandrel to make sure that the coating is even and intact.
Turn on the gas to your torch head.
Adjust the flame until you have a sharp edged blue cone.
Select the color of glass you want to start with.
When the tip begins to glow, leave the glass in the flame a little longer, then start rotating the rod as a ball starts to form at the tip.

,
When ready to start forming your bead, take the mandrel with your other hand.
Carefully alter the position of the rod in your hand so that you are holding it like a pencil.

,
Gently press the ball of molten glass through the flame and onto the mandrel.
Stay in the flame.
When you have added enough glass, pull away the glass rod (remember to keep the mandrel rotating in the flame).
To round up your bead, keep the mandrel rotating in the flame until a smooth form is achieved.
When finished, slowly remove the bead from the flame (remember to keep rotating) when the glow fades.
When cool, soak the bead and mandrel in water to remove the bead release.
Leave the bead to soak in water.

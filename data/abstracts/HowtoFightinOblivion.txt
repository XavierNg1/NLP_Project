Decide what kind of fighter you want to be.
Purchase a weapon (For example a sword, axe or club) and a bow equipped with arrows, although bows can be easily substituted with long range destruction spells.
Poison your arrows and enchant your bow, armour and weapons if they aren't already.
Roam the countryside for a creature to slay.
Shoot your target, twice if you can manage.
Wait for your target to reach your location and attack them first - make sure your first hit is a power attack, which is done by holding down the attack button.

,
Block when the enemy counter-attacks.
Strike back soon after your enemy has hit your shield whilst you were blocking as they will have been knocked back a bit, providing a perfect opening for an attack.

,
Re-poise your weapon if needed to give you the upper hand.
Continue to attack and counter attack and poison you weapons until your opponent is dead.

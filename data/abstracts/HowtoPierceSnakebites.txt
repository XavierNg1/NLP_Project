Make sure that you have all of the supplies that you will need.
Wash your hands thoroughly with handwash to ensure that your hands are germ free.
Clean the area you are going to pierce.
Decide the positioning of your piercings.
Unwrap your piercing needle which should have come in a sterile packaging.
Once you have pierced the lip, unscrew the ball from your sterilised lip bar and place the bar inside the hollow hole at the end of the needle, then remove the needle from the lip which will then pull the lip bar into place.
Care for your piercings.

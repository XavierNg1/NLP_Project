Make goals for yourself that you can meet and make sure they matter to you.
Your long-term goal may be to do 20 push-ups or to run a mile in less than 10 minutes.
Your short term goals will start off as daily goals, based on what you can do now.
You can have multiple short term goals.

If you are REALLY out of shape, don't worry about the scale at first.
Eat breakfast, lunch and dinner including a snack or two.
Drink lots of water.
Track your progress on meeting your daily goals.
Build up your exercise to 1/2 to 1 hour a day.
Turn on your favorite music and dance (sing, if you want).

Strength training is important.
Stomach crunches are good for this.
Leg lifts are also good leg lifts.
Every little bit helps.
Can you walk up stairs?,
Your muscles may feel sore as you start to use them more.
Also think about your balance.
The other part of improving fitness is to look at what you eat.

Know that cold-brewing is the best way to get flavorful, undiluted cold coffee.
Mix the ground coffee and water together in a pitcher.
Add any sugar before chilling your coffee.
Cover the pitcher with plastic wrap.
Chill the coffee in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours, or overnight.
Place a coffee filter in a mesh strainer and rest it over a medium bowl.
Slowly pour your cold-brew through the strainer.
Alternatively, make cold brew in a French Press instead of a pitcher.

Pull your panties down to your knees.
Unwrap the pad.
Remove the backing to expose the sticky side of the pad.
Center the pad in the middle part (the crotch) of your underpants, or the part that goes between your legs.The wider or bigger side of the pad should go to the back of your panties, toward your butt.
Pull your panties all the way up.
Dispose of the used pad by rolling it up and putting it in the wrapper.If you threw out the wrapper, just wrap the pad in some toilet paper.

Feel free to ask your hosts questions about Judaism.
If your friends are Orthodox Jews, don't expect hugs, kisses, and handshakes from the women if you're a man, because touch (even something considered "casual contact" in the non-observant world, such as a handshake) is a form of intimacy and therefore, reserved for spouses and immediate family only (children, parents, siblings).
Dress appropriately.
If it's Shabbat, ritual handwashing will be done, and there will be blessings for Shabbat candles, wine, challah (bread), children, and guests.
If it's Passover, (the feast of unleavened bread) matzah is served in place of bread, and no regular flour-containing items will be served.
Watch what everyone is saying and doing, and don't talk, eat, and drink until everyone else does.

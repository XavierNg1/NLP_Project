Sift 3 cups of flour into a large bowl.
Add a teaspoon of salt to the flour and whisk in.
Crack 2 eggs and 1 yolk into the cone-shaped well.
Use a fork to whisk up the eggs in the well, slowly incorporating the flour.
Add a quarter cup of water and mix everything with the fork.
Ditch the fork and knead the dough until it forms a soft, slightly sticky ball.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest for an hour.
Lightly flour a large, open counter.
Roll the dough out on a floured surface to your desired thickness.
Use a sharp knife or a pizza cutter to cut noodles.
Cook the noodles in boiling water or chicken broth until they float.

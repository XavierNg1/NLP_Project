Pray thankfully and praise God and end your prayers positively.
Increase (or start) thanking, and praising, and lifting up (be a booster of) God and Jesus for any good things (called blessings) in your life.
Stop harboring sin in your life: Yep, this would kill it from the get-go!,
Forgive others: Live as God's child that He loves "positionally" in Christ, and you will be in His joy forever, including in sorrow He's your comfort (joy).
Obey God: John 15:7, "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.",
Believe, never doubting.
See the results and be inspired.
Confirm God's will in prayer, for God is not mocked: as whatever a man plants into other lives and hearts, he will also harvest.

Ask for God's will to be done.
Stand firm without giving up: Sometimes God wants us to persist in prayer...
Love your enemy and never treat others wrongly.

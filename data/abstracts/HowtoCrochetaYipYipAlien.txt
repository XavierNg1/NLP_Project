Choose a brightly colored yarn, in a medium to slender weight.
Make a slip knot.
Join the end of the chain to the beginning, with a slip stitch, to form a loop.
Single crochet around this loop for several rows, until you have a tube that's about as tall as the loop is big around.
Single crochet three or four rows across just one half of the tube.
Look ahead a few steps to see how these decreasing rows will be gathered together form the face of the yip-yip.
Make some yarn eyeballs to go with your yip-yip.
Locate the eyes and thread them into the face.
Stitch the face together using the yarn tail, down the front.
Cut a number of lengths of the colorful yarn.
Add a fringe.
With your hook in the loop you just pulled through, grab both of the loose tails and pull them through the loop.
Put your hook through the original starting chain and pull only one of the two tails through.
Chain the tail for 20-25 chain stitches.
Tie a tight knot when you reach the end of the chain.

,
Trim off the excess as close to the knot as you're comfortable cutting it.
Attach a loop of the body color yarn on the back of the head if you wish to hang the yip-yip.

Cleanse your skin thoroughly.
Exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate.
If you have dry skin, apply an appropriate moisturizer that meets your needs.
Wear primer.
Remember that, when applying your foundation, little is always better.
If you are not committed to faithfully reapplying pencil, opt for a liquid liner.
Choose a thin but intense formula and do not be afraid to apply a quality lash primer beneath.
Eyeshadow must be of quality mill.
Experiment with a cheek stain if you use blush but be sure to place the product accurately.
Line your lips if you want the colour locked.
Choose a thin formula, spray it in the air and then step through it, allowing the mist to settle on your face.
Finished.

Trust your people.
Encourage people to be talking to each other about good ideas for improving various phases of practices, production, the organization -- and to bring it to your attention.
Don't spend much time standing around with comfortable acquaintances, people you already know at trade shows and conventions, dinners, banquets, etc.

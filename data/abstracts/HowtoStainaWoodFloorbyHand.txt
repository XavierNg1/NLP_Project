Remove the previous finish.
Ensure you have enough stain to cover the whole area (plus 10% to be safe).
Prepare your rags.
Start brushing the stain on in one far corner.
Start ragging on the stain thickly.
Moving along the boards, brush against the back wall, another 3 to 5 feet (0.9 to 1.5 m) before dipping the "ragging on" rag in the stain and staining that area the same 18 inches (45.7 cm) deep as before.
Go back to the other side and start a new row.
Finish up the last area.
Give the stain plenty of time to dry (as indicated on the tin).

Start by mounting your television and television mount to the wall.
Cut two holes in the drywall, one near the television and one near the A/V receiver or other audio video equipment.
Fish wires from the top to the bottom (never bottom to top) that are rated for in-wall use.
Install some sort of sleeve around the hole so as to give it a finished look.

Mount your television and reconnect all cables.

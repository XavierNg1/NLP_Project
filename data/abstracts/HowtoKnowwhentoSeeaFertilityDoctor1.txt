Consider visiting a fertility specialist sooner if you have had miscarriages in the past.
Seek treatment if you have had any problems with endometriosis, ovarian cysts or if your fallopian tubes are blocked.
Seek the help of a fertility specialist if the male in the relationship has a low sperm count.

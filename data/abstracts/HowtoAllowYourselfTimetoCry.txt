Sit down by yourself and think over what's been going on in your life.
Pick a time/place where you feel comfortable crying.
Make sure you are alone.
Turn down the lights, close the blinds, cover yourself with a blanket, or put a pillow (gently) over your face.
Don't think degrading or rude thoughts about yourself.
Give yourself time to clean up.
Allow yourself as much time as you need, so plan ahead.

Brush the donkey regularly.
Keep the hooves dry and trimmed.
Check the teeth for sharp edges.
Keep vaccinations upâ€“to-date.
Donkeys, like horses can get intestinal worms.
Keeping the pasture and barn as free from waste as possible will help to break the life cycle of the worm as they need to live for a certain amount of time outside the donkey before being ingested.

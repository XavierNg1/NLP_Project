Assess the amount of damage done.
Prepare quickly to pick up the glass.
Find some newspaper, strong, thick gloves (gardening gloves are good) and if need be, your eyeglasses.
Put on the gloves.
Avoid kneeling in the area where the glass has fallen.
Turn on a light to help you see better if the area is dark.
Place newspaper down in a collection point where there is no glass.
Collect the largest pieces of broken glass first.
Once you have all of the glass collected (and do a double, triple check, including under things and around corners), roll up the newspaper with care.

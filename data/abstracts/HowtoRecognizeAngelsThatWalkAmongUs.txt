Look first at your mother.
Talk to little children.
Listen to their message.
Seek out really good people; people who don't lie or deceive.
Remember your dreams, they have meanings.
Remember that when the student is ready a teacher is provided.
Open your eyes to perfect strangers.
Look for miracles that happen every day.
Think of your many friends and how many times they looked out for your safety.
Recall the medical help from doctors or dentist.
 Last we cannot forget our teachers.

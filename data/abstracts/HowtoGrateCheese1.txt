Grate cheese using a microplane cheese grater.
Unwrap your block of cheese.
Holding the microplane over a plate or board, gently swipe the cheese against the grate using an up-and-down motion.
Tap the metal end of the grater lightly against the edge of the plate to release excess trimmings.
Switch out your microplane size depending on what you're using cheese for.

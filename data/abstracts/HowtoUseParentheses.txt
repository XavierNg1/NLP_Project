Use parentheses for supplemental information.If you want to include information related to the main text, but that information does not fit into the main part of the sentence or paragraph, you would enclose that information in parentheses.
Note figures in parentheses.
Enclose numbers or letters for a list.When you need to list a series of information within a paragraph or sentence, numbering each point within that series can make the list less confusing.
Indicate plural nouns.
Specify an acronym.
Mention significant dates.
Use parenthetical citations.In academic writing for both the MLA and APA styles, parenthetical citations need to be included in the text whenever you directly or indirectly cite another work.
Place punctuation outside of the parentheses.Ordinarily, parenthetical information falls within a broader sentence.
Punctuate inside the parentheses for full sentences.
Enclose other punctuation as needed.Commas, colons, or semicolons that appear in the middle of parenthetical text should be included in the parentheses.
Only use punctuation when called for in the sentence.

Write songs.
Choose your best songs.
Decide where your band is going to record.
You can record at your home studio.
Or you can record at a professional recording studio.
Keep the tracks down to two or three, nobody will listen to your demo CD if you provide your epic 20-track mega collection that has ten minute solos on each track.

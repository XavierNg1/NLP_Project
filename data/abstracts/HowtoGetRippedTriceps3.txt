Warm up before lifting or working out.
Give two days rest between hard days on the triceps.
Eat a meal high in lean protein shortly after working out.
Use compound exercises that involve your triceps on off-days, or to develop great triceps without necessarily focusing on them.
Vary the exercises that you do instead of sticking to the same 2-3 every week.
Add weight slowly, aiming to keep the last 3-4 reps over every single exercise difficult.

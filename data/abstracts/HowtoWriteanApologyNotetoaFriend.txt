Think about what you did and to whom you did it.
When you've decided that this person is truly angry with you, think about how you feel; are you also angry at them?,
People say that writing a note is a bad idea, but some people find that when they are very angry talking to them face to face is nearly impossible, because they will interrupt you, try to intimidate you, or get you mad all over again.
Decide whether you want to hand write it or type it up.
Once you've decided, get your stuff together.
Start two spaces from the top of the page, or two lines from the first line on paper.
Start of by writing something along the lines of 'I know you're really angry at me, but I just want to explain what happened.',
Start writing down what they did that made you mad.
Finish up by writing about friendship.
Fold it up (not too small) and write the person's name on the front.

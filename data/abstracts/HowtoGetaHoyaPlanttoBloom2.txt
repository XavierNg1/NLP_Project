Give the Hoya plant 5-10-5 water-soluble houseplant fertilizer once a month in the spring, summer and fall.
Do not give your plant fertilizer in the winter while it is resting.
Dilute your fertilizer.
Look for signs that your plant is getting too much, or not enough, fertilizer.
Give the diluted fertilizer to the Hoya right after watering.

Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C) and stand your ice cream cones up in a muffin tin.
Mix together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
Cream the butter in a separate bowl.
Add the sugar a little bit at a time into the creamed butter.
Beat in the vanilla extract, then add the eggs one at a time, beating after each one.
Alternate between adding the flour mixture and the milk, mixing well after each addition.
Fill the cones ½ to ⅔ of the way with the batter.Each cone will take about 4 tablespoons (60 milliliters) of batter.Don't fill them all the way; you need the extra space for expansion.
Bake the cones for about 18 minutes.They are ready when a toothpick poked into the center comes out clean.
Allow the cupcake cones to cool completely.
Beat the butter on medium speed for 6 minutes.
Add the sugar, vanilla extract, and salt, and mix again.
Use a large cookie scoop to drop the frosting onto the cupcakes.
Place the cupcakes into the fridge for 1 hour so that the frosting can set.
Bring the heavy cream to a just below a boil in a small saucepan.
Pour the heavy cream over the chocolate chips.
Cover the bowl with foil, and let it sit for 5 minutes.During this time, the hot cream will melt the chocolate chips without scorching them.
Stir the chocolate chips and milk together with a whisk until combined.
Let the mixture sit until it cools and thickens.
Use a spoon to pour the ganache onto the frosting and swirl it around.
Top each cupcake with a maraschino cherry and sprinkles.
Refrigerate the cupcakes for 1 hour before serving them.Once again, set the cupcakes down onto the muffin tin, and place the tin back into the fridge.
Finished.

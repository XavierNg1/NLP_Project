Equip silencers on some of your guns (if you have it unlocked for that gun).
If you don't have silencers unlocked for any decent guns, try using the UAV Jammer perk.
Watch your radar for the location of enemies.
If there is an enemy chopper in the air, tell your team to shoot it, and shoot it yourself too.
Glass, thin sheets of wood, thin metal and thin concrete can be shot through, remember this.

Try out all the weapons and perk combos.
When in dangerous open area, take short sprints from safe covered spots to other safe covered spots.Try to go around fire fights, a lot of people get caught up in intense fights in the same part of each map, going around the fight and attacking from behind is a sure fire way to earn some kills

If you want to cheaply own no matter what, then upgrade your connection so you are host, then use the m16 and stopping power.

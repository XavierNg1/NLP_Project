Buy a good quality unicycle.
Get the right Wheel size.
Get your unicycle set up properly.
Buy (and use) safety equipment.
Find a suitable site for learning to ride.
Practice for 15 minutes or so, once or twice a day.
To mount a uni for a beginner, align the pedal cranks vertically to the ground (one pedal will be as close to the ground as is possible, while the uni is upright).
The first time you get up on your uni, just concentrate on sitting on it while holding on to something.
When you are comfortable with sitting on the uni, begin to try to ride forward.
Donâ€™t give up!,
Finished.

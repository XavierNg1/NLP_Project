Cut a piece of tulle ribbon twice the desired length.
Cut a few more lengths of ribbon.Fold the first piece of ribbon in half.
Tie the ribbon onto the hair elastic.
Keep making knots.
Keep knotting ribbons and make them as thick or as thin as you want.Finish when you feel that you have enough ribbons added to the elastic.And there you have it, a Webkinz tutu.

Comb your hair.
Take a section of hair from behind one ear and braid upward.
Gather another section of hair from the area where you want the band to rest.
Connect the new hair with one of the sections in the braid and continue braiding.
Add a section of hair from the opposite side of the head and continue braiding.
Work in a section of hair from behind the other ear and finish the braid.

Consider having an assistant or handler for the animal.
Use natural light.
Focus on the eyes.
Shoot at your pet's eye level.
Show your pet's personality and character.
Shoot close up.
Have you ever tried to take a picture of your pet, but they do not make eye contact with the camera?,
For a relaxed, formal portrait, schedule your session when the animal is somewhat sleepy or has just woke up.
Be patient.
Experiment with angles and positions.

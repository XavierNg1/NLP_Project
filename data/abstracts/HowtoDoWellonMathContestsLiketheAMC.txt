Test yourself.
Don't try to solve a lot of problems right before the big test.

OK, the test is in front of you and the stage is set.
Open the test book, and get started.
If you come across a question you can't do, give it one more thought.
There will always (well, almost always) be problems you can't solve.
Write clearly.
If you feel yourself slowing down, or getting tired, or even giving up, ask yourself this - How many more chances will I get?,
Don't be afraid of success.
When it's all over, and you've checked over one last time, it's time to let go.
Evaluate your performance.

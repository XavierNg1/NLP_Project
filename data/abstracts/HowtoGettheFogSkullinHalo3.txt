Begin the Floodgate campaign level on Halo 3.
Start the campaign level and run towards the entrance to the destroyed city of Voi.
Look for the tall building on the right with the ICBM Launcher in front of it; this is the building which you will need to focus on to collect the skull.
Wait for a marine to cry out "All squads report".
Shoot the Flood with your battle rifle or carbine.
Claim the Fog Skull by pressing the Right Bumper button on your Xbox 360 controller.

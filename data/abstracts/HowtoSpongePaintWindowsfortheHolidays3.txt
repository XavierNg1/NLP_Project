Tape the stencil flat against the window using masking tape or painter's tape.
Pour a little of your paint into a small bowl.

,
Add dish soap, if needed, and stir.

Dip one side of a soft sponge into the paint.
Hold the sponge above the bowl to allow excess paint to drip off.

Use smaller sponges when filling in pictures that require multiple colors.
Allow the paint to dry before removing your tape and stencils.

Learn that a cookie exchange party is a clever way to encourage the spirit of giving, plenty of warm wishes and lots of fun throughout the day.
Send out invitations to your guests at least before the date of your cookie exchange.
Notify those whom are signed up of who is coming, how many people will be there, and how many cookies they will need to bring.
Request that everyone only makes holiday cookies or expand your collection to include other goodies such as home made candy, chocolate covered pretzels, or other festive sweets.
Have everyone tell stories.
Swap family recipes.

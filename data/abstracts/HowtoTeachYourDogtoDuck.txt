Use a target and a clicker.
Have the dog stand in front of you.
Lower the target a little more under the dog's head.
Lower the target bit by bit until you are happy with the duck.

,
Remove the target.
Now you want the dog to duck faster.
When the dog lowers his or her head fast enough, use a command.
Say "Christmas" and see if the dog ducks.
Stand further away from your dog when saying the command.

Take stock of what you have.
Remove any painful mementos.
Do something you've always wanted to do but never had the time for.
Go for a night out with your friends.
Tell yourself the truth: There will be others out there.
If you were in a hurtful relationship with your family, resist the urge to see them.
Be patient.

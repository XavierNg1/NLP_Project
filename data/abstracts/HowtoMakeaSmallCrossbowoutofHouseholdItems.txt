Tape two pencils together, leaving at least a centimeter untaped at either end.
Tape the two pencil pairs together to form a lowercase “T.” Duct tape works best, but you can use other kinds of tape (or even rubber bands or glue).
Take apart a cheap or useless pen.
Tape the tube to the main bar of the “t.”Be sure to line the top of the tube up with the top of the “t,” which will be the shooting end of the crossbow.
Stretch a rubber band horizontally over the tube.
Wrap tape around the center of the rubber band several times.
Wrap a rubber band around the pencils beneath the loading end of the tube.
Put the ink cartridge back into the tube so that it's sticking out slightly.
Stretch the rubber-band to the end of the tube.
Grab the ink cartridge, pull it back with the rubber band, and let go.
Use the top and bottom of the pen for a cap.
Finished.

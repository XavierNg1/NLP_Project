Peel the onion, cut off the stems, and chop it up very, finely.
Heat the onion, oil, and Â½ teaspoon (2.5 grams) of salt in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat.
Fry the onion until it starts to caramelize, stirring every 20 seconds.
Add the minced garlic, and fry for a few more seconds.
Remove the onion from heat and stir in the Worcestershire sauce and fresh thyme, if desired.
Let the onion mixture cool.
Fill a medium-sized bowl with yogurt, then stir in the onion mixture.
Stir in the salt and pepper, to taste, and taste before making any adjustments.
Consider refrigerating the dip, covered, for an hour before serving it.
Finished.

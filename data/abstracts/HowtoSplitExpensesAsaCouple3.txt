Plan for emergencies.Both you and your partner should have money saved in the event that one or both of you needs to pay for surgery, a new vehicle, or another large expense.
Have regular financial checkups.Every month or two, you and your partner should have a conversation about where youâ€™re both at financially.
Do not move in with your significant other for financial reasons.Living with someone else and sharing expenses does save money, but if you make the decision to shack up based on the potential economic benefit, your relationship will be on an unstable foundation.
Avoid borrowing money.Not only is it annoying for your partner, but it might make them suspicious of your financial health and question your intentions.
Avoid sharing debts.Cosigning a loan for your partner is never a good idea.
Do not share assets.Assets are valuable possessions or investments.

Don't use spaces in file names as far as possible.
Never name your files with long, nonsensical names.
If you use some files very often, and you want them to appear at the top every time you see the file list, prefix the names with symbols such as ~,Â !, @, etc.
Try to name similar-content files with similar names.
Remember, all these steps can be applied to folders, too.

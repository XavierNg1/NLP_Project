Use a piece of 9 X 11" white tagboard for your base.
Cut a variety of colored tag board strips measuring 11 inches long and 1", 1 1/4", and 1 1/2" wide.
Begin work from the opposite side of the base creating a mirror image of the three strips already in place.

Get creative!,

Locate the center of the page and measure up, down and side to side, 1 1/2" and draw a rectangle.

Place a favorite picture behind the frame and tape it in place.

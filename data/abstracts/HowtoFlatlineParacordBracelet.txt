Gather you supplies.
Attach the paracord to the buckle, and measure it on your wrist.
Lay the piece of paracord you want to be the center color across the top, including over the flatline piece.
Take the center color of paracord, lay it across the top, but under the flatline piece.
Continue the same pattern weaving the flatline over under every knot, until you get to the end.
Cut off the ends of the paracord as close to the bracelet as possible, and melt them with a lighter.

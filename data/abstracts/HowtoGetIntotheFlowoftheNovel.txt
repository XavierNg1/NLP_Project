Start fresh by getting a good night's sleep and have something to eat so you can write for several hours.
Clear your head so you can approach your work without the frustrations of daily life get in the way of being creative.
Eliminate distractions.
Silence your internal editor by giving yourself permission to write without stopping.
Prepare yourself before you write.
Work as fast as you can.
Set a schedule for yourself.

Buy a short length of link chain.
Secure the chain to your belt.
Secure the chain to your wallet by punching a hole in the wallet, or by buying a new wallet with a hole punched in it already.
Wear your wallet and feel secure that no one will be able to grab your wallet when it's attached to you with a chain.

Set your chin facing slightly down.
Donâ€™t smile, and keep your mouth closed in a natural position.
Keep your eyes focused on something ahead of you.
Stand up straight!,
Place one foot in front of the other and walk with long strides.
Allow your arms to hang at your sides, and keep your hands relaxed.
Practice walking with your heels on.
Get a rhythm down, and keep it consistent with your step.
Strike your pose.
Walk like a predator down the catwalk.
Strut with attitude down the catwalk like Naomi Campbell.
Make your walk a march like Sasha Pivovarova.

Think about why you enjoy being alone.
Value your strengths.
Accept yourself for who you are.
Learn what you can from critics, and ignore the rest.
Nurture the relationships that are valuable to you.
Disconnect from social media.
Make a space that is just for you.
Get up early or go to bed later.
Go do something you enjoy.
Carry a book or wear headphones.
Enjoy the moment.
Try to chat with someone you donâ€™t know every once in awhile.

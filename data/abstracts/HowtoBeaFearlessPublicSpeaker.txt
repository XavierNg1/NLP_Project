Do some deep breathing exercises when you feel nervous or before you are about to speak.
Sit upright in a chair or wherever is comfortable; close your eyes and imagine a peaceful place where you have no worries.
Practice your presentation.
Share your fears with your close friends, if they will be in the audience.
If your speech is written, highlight certain words where you can pause and look up into the audience confidently, and without losing your place.

When you are done with it, write in a journal or just on a loose piece of paper how good you felt and what you did right and what you could've improved upon.
Don't dwell on your presentation if it doesn't go as planned.

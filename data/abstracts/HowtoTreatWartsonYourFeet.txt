Consider how common warts are, and know that you are not alone with this problem.
Be aware that warts are most common in children and young adults, which can help in diagnosing them.
Understand that for anyone with warts, it is easier to treat fewer, smaller warts.
Use salicylic acid, at home or with the help of a healthcare provider if you would like additional guidance.Prior to treatment with salicylic acid, use a nail file or a pumice stone to remove the outer layer of your wart(s), so that the dead skin cells (the callous part) is removed.You will know when you are done because the skin underneath the callous part is much more sensitive and it will hurt to continue scraping any further.
Try duct tape â€” another effective remedy that can be used at home.
Try exposing the wart(s) to high temperatures (this is called "hyperthermia").
Use garlic cloves.
Try tea tree oil.
Ask your doctor to try cryotherapy (also called liquid nitrogen).
Try having your wart removed via shave excision.
Ask your doctor about other medical treatments.

If you have the quilts in storage for the summer months, periodically take them out of storage and air them.If you are going to air the quilt indoors, then you can either hang it in the laundry or drape the quilt over furniture or lay it out on a spare bed.
Hand vacuum the quilt when airing it which will remove any dust and musty smells.
Prevent the quilt from retaining odours while being stored use either activated charcoal of cedarwood shavings in the area where you are storing the quilt.
Consider if you really should clean them.
If you think that your antique quilt requires airing and cleaning, then make sure you take it to a dry cleaner that is reputable and experienced with antique quilts.
However, if your quilt is made from fabrics such as satins, brocades and velvets then you need to be aware that these types of fabrics can disintegrate when being dry-cleaned.
Be very careful when storing and cleaning, as this may result in irreparable damage.
Each time you air the quilt, make sure you fold it differently each time to prevent breaking the fibres.

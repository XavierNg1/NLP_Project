Go to your chosen neighborhood and choose an empty lot from the empty lot bin.
After setting your lot on the spot you picked, go to Create-A-Family mode.
Create a family.
Save your family and return to the neighborhood.
Once your family is in, go to build mode and build your house/lot.

,
After you finish constructing your house, purchase some furniture.
When the house is all neat and complete, if there's enough space left, add a backyard.
Before exiting Buy/build mode, make sure there isn't any custom content.
Begin playing the game with your sims and have the Sims build many relationships with the neighbors.
Make it so that your Sims have conflicts and careers and all that stuff.
When you think you've made your "story", compare it to the Goth family's story.
When everything's complete, upload the occupied lot if you wish.

Lay the pike on it's belly and cut about half inch down right behind the head.
Angle the blade towards the tail and cut all the way towards the fin.
Cut upwards, mimicking the angle of the back fin, to remove the top fillet.
Use pliers, your fingers, or careful knife work to remove any center bones from the fillet.
Skin the fillet, if desired, while still fresh.
Use a finger feel out the Y-shaped bones poking out of the top of the fish.
Flip the fish on its side and plunge the knife in behind the head.
Turn the knife and cut down to the dorsal fin, using the Y-bones as you guide.
Pull up as you reach the dorsal fins to complete the fillet.
Check for any stray bones, pulling away with pliers or your fingers.
Flip the fish over and repeat on the opposite side.
Locate the vent, a small hole on the underside of the fish.
Plunge the knife in just behind the vent, towards the tail.
Cut along the fish until you just about reach the end.
Starting at this hinge, get the knife between the skin and meat to easily remove the skin and scales.
Use a spoon to scoop out any extra meat around the bones if making a stew, fish patties, meat balls, etc.

Find out what you are holding onto and why.
Explain to your riding instructor why you feel insecure and why you prefer to hold the pommel or the horn.
Learn that when you feel insecure, hold the cloth a little more until you feel confident.
Try holding the cloth with only your little finger, this allows better control and allows you to simply release your little finger without thinking and grabbing hold again.
Understand that when riding in a competition, you will need to understand that you will be disqualified for touching your saddle, so this will encourage you to let go.
Ride by trotting and you will want to grab hold of the saddle again.
Know that at canter or lope, you will want to hold on to the horn or pommel again, repeat the breathing exercises and gradually take your hand from the saddle to the mane.

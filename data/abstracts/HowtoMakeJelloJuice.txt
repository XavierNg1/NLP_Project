Buy your packaged Jell-O.
Set up your work space.
Making the jello drinks, the first way.
Fill your cup(s) with water.
Take an average spoon, and just mix it up good.
Garnishes!,
The SECOND way.
Get out several small containers.
Do the same thing in the previous step, decreasing the amount of powder in each one.
Take a small baster from your kitchen, and suck up the first container, with the heaviest batch.
Do this with all of the other containers, slowly and carefully.
Your jello drink will have the colours stacked on top of the others.
Once again, add your own touch.

Get a soccer ball- this is really a must.
Practice dribbling- Use the inside (instep) and outside of your foot to kick the ball while you run.
Pass with the inside of your foot.
To shoot, place the ball at least 10 feet (3.0Â m) from a goal or wall.
For throw-ins, throw the ball over your head with both hands.
When doing headers, hit the ball with your hairline, not the top of your head.

Stay on goal side of the person you are defending.

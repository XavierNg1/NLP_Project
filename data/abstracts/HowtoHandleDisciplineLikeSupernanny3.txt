Set up a room that has a space where the teen can go when they need discipline.
Give them their warning.
Take the child over to the reflection room, if their discipline problem continues.
Set the timer for 1 minute for every year of age the child is.
Talk about the situation after their time to reflect has completed.
Have the child discuss what they've written down on the sheet of paper.

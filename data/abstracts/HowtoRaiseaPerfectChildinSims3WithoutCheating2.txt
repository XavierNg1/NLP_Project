Have one female and one male Sim who already have an existing relationship (boyfriend/girlfriend or higher) try for a baby.
While your Sim is pregnant, do everything you can to improve the pregnancy.
Once the baby is born, give it good traits (e.g. Friendly, Good,Â  Excitable, Good sense of humor).
Always make sure he/she is in a good mood all the time.
The baby stage does not do much for a child's development, so if you want to, go ahead and buy a birthday cake and make the child age up into a toddler.

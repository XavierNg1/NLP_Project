Choose your rope.
Thread some embroidery floss onto a sharp tapestry needle, and tie a knot in the end.
Roll the rope into a small, coin-sized disk.
Pass the needle and thread through the center of the disk to form an X.
Make your first stitch starting at the top of your disk.
Make your second stitch.
Keep repeating your first and second stitches until your basket is the width you want it to be.
Start building up the sides.
Continue building the sides of your basket using the two stitches from before.
Cut and bind off your rope.
Finish the basket.

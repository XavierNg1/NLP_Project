Don’t be afraid to say “no.” You may give into your preschooler’s demands for a myriad of reasons: guilt for not spending enough time with them, wanting them to be happy, or giving them what they want.
Ignore their demands.
Respond to requests.
Teach your child not to be demanding in public.
Prepare ahead of time for difficult situations.
Expect tantrums.
Present a united front.
Get outside help, if you need it.

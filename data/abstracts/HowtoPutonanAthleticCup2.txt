Put your cup-jockstrap on first, under your underwear if you choose to wear underwear too.
You should use a cup-athletic supporter and not a regular athletic supporter.
Slide your cup into the pouch of the cup athletic supporter.
Bend, squat and do some practice moves to make sure the cup stays in place and does not pinch, bind or chafe against your thighs.

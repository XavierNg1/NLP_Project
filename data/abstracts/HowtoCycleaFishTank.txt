Set up your aquarium and filtration system.

Perform frequent water changes.
Use test kits to monitor toxin levels.
Add additional fish gradually once toxin levels are near-zero.
Assemble and prepare your tank.
Add a sprinkling of fish flakes.
Test your water for ammonia in a few days.
Try to keep the ammonia level at about three ppm.
After a week, start testing for nitrites.
Wait for a sudden drop in nitrites and a rise in nitrates.
Add fish gradually when ammonia and nitrite levels are near zero.
Add filter media from a mature tank.
Add gravel from a mature tank.
Have live plants in the aquarium.
Beware the risk of cross-contamination.
Add small amounts of salt to freshwater tanks.

Determine if you have hard or soft water.
If you have soft water, you only need about 1 tablespoon (1/16 cup) of liquid High Efficiency (HE) soap.
If you have hard water, never use more than 2 tablespoons (1/8 cup) of liquid HE soap.
After you have used the correct amount of soap (as outlined above), for a month or two, run the same test above just to make sure that with your water and the brand soap you use, it is the correct amount.
Using too much soap also adds to the smell that most front load machines either have (or will have) over time.

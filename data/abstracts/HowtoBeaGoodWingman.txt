Don't try to wing for someone who is significantly less appealing than you.
Let your friend take the lead.
Give him dibs.
Start pairing off.
Work interference if necessary.
Know when to talk and when to shut up.
Don't get distracted.
Don't get too wasted.
Stay in it for the long haul.
If you're taken, mention it...eventually.
Make your friend look good...but not too good.
Keep your friend presentable.
Let your friend know if he has no chance.
Be a good connector.
End the night like a pro.

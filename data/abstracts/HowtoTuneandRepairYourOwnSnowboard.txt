Set up your bench or saw horses.
Remove the bindings (It's just easier to work on the board without them).








,
Place the board on horses or bench and give it a good pre-cleaning with window cleaner and paper towels then grab a rag and your base cleaner.
With the base up, take your knife and start LIGHTLY digging out any embedded rocks, dirt, etc.
Grab your torch, light it, (a low intensity flame is best) grab a Ptex candle and your metal scraper.








,
With your torch standing upright on your bench, stick your Ptex candle into the flame and hold it at about a 45 degree angle until you get a BLUE flame from the candle.
Grab your metal scraper, making sure it is SHARP with no burrs.
Take a scotch brite pad and smooth out your repairs, making sure that you move the pad tip to tail only, lengthwise along the base.








,
Grab your diamond stone or deburring/sharpening stone and run it over the edges of the snowboard a few times (sides and bottom) to remove all burrs that will damage your file.








,
It is best to use your edge tool here to ensure even cuts.
Wipe down the base with acetone to remove all of the dirt, etc.
Turn on your iron.
Drip wax onto the base of the board from tip to tail in a swirling pattern.
Grab your plastic scraper and repeat what you did with the metal scraper.
Take a new scotch brite pad and stroke the wax from tip to tail.
Mount your bindings and you're ready to rip!

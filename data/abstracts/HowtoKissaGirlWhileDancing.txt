Do your best to make sure she likes you.
Make sure your breath smells nice before asking her to dance.
Ask her to dance to a slow song.
Go with the flow.
Move in closer and whisper something sweet.
Move your face back and look into her eyes.
Tilt your head and gently kiss her.
Caress and her neck and hair.
Go in for a deeper kiss.
Back your head away and look into her eyes as you finish kissing.

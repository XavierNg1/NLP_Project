Get some basic supplies that everybody needs: pencils, pens, folders, notebooks, binders, loose-leaf paper, highlighters, spare lead if you use a mechanical pencil, etc.
Make sure that you have pockets or sections in a binder for everything you have.
Make sure you have spare lead/ink for pencils and pens.
It might not be the best idea to get a binder for every class.
Find a personal preference.
Clean out your folders every month.
If you keep a day planner to keep track of assignments, rip out the pages once a week.
Have fun with it!

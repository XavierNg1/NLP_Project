Use lemon juice to marinate meat, poultry, and fish.
Make sure to choose spices and herbs that complement the taste of lemon.
Marinate beef and pork for two hours to maximize the amount of flavor the meat picks up from the marinade.
Allow poultry to marinate for 30 minutes to about four or five hours.

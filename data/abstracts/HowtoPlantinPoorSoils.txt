Choose your plant carefully.
Dig a hole slightly larger than the pot the plant came in or slightly bigger than the root ball.
Amend the soil with a high quality and ecologically responsible soil amendment such as Big Frog.
Remove some of the mixed soil-- enough to put the plants roots into the hole.
Water in the roots.
Put compost around the top of the new plant being sure to cover the soil you just dug.
Step around the hole to ensure the soil has settled around the roots.
Check the progress every couple of days.

Wash your hair if it's not clean.
Add your parting where you would like it to be.
Split your hair into three almost equal sections.
Place the ribbon by one section of hair.
Begin braiding in the way that you would usually do.
Continue braiding until you reach a good place to finish, or you have run out of ribbon/hair.
Use a clip, if wished.
Done.

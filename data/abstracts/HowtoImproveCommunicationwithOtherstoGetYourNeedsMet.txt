Sit or lie somewhere comfortable and quiet.
Turn your attention to your breathing again.
Grab a pen and paper, or laptop/tablet.
On a another page, write two headings above two columns.
Take a look at the values that you are content with and be proud of yourself and acknowledge that you are living your truth with these.
Number these values you wish to think more about by prioritising the most important as number one and so forth.
Break these statements down even further.
Use "I" statements.Express to the other person how important it is that you have a massage and how it will benefit you (as a person and as a caregiver).
See if your communication, using "I" statements, works and whether the behaviour/possibly resistance of the other person changes.
Once you feel that you are confident with articulating your number one value and getting that need met, work you way down your list.

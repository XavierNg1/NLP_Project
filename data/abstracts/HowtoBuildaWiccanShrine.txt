Find a foundation.
Once you've selected a foundation for your shrine, you may want to choose an altar cloth to cover it.
You'll need a symbol of the Wiccan God and Goddess for your shrine.
You will also want a censer and incense to grace your shrine to the Wiccan God and Goddess.
The final necessity for your shrine to the Wiccan God and Goddess is a small plate, bowl or other container to hold offerings.
Once you have put your shrine together, you will want to bless it before using it for the first time.

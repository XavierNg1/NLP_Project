Take care of yourself first.
Establish a routine for yourself and your children as soon as possible.
Wake-up at least 15 to 30 minutes before your children to snag a little time for yourself and prepare for the day.
Arrange for a little bit of cuddle time in the morning if your children are still young.
Encourage your children whenever possible.
Try to say "no" as little as possible.
Encourage your children to help out around the house.
Appreciate the differences in each child.
Start getting them ready for bed at least an hour early.
Prepare for the next day by checking your calendar, creating a to-do list, and laying out the clothes you will need (your children's clothes as well if they aren't old enough to do this on their own).

Congratulate yourself, you just made it through a day of parenting.

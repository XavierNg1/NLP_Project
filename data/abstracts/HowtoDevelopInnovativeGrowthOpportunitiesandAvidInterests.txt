Think beyond the basic necessities to apply useful information.
Decide which greater desires and felt "needs", problems, opportunities -- currently beyond your grasp, not mere whims -- that you want to pursue to grow.

,
Be aware of where you may find good, serviceable used ideas/or used equipment.
Goal set for your special purpose arena, for your avid interest, not boring to you; find a niche (or a slice of something), to observe; look to find tools and ideas; differentiate and develop their use.

,
Look purposefully.
Get up higher.
Get experience, training in helpers so that you can use people smarter than yourself in related areas -- and also educate yourself as needed in your arena/niche.
Focus on "doing", not just on "having" ideas.
Fill, supply or create a need to benefit others -- so there will be demand, not just supply.
Mingle with the kind of people who are succeeding in your chosen arena.
Use other people's money (OPM) to advantage, as leverage, like a tool.

,
Begin the reality of what is wanted.
Develop that by putting depth, material, context and objectives in place.
Persistence is needed, early and often.
Regroup, resort, re-equip, but don't quit, inertia can keep you going, or make starting hard.
Build momentum, build the good inertia of action.
Expect success.
Repeat your steps as needed.

Sanitize the extractor.When you work with the comedo extractor, there will be a small opening in your skin where the blackhead or whitehead comes out.
Position the extractor properly.
Press down gently but firmly.Once the comedo is within the extractorâ€™s loop, you want to apply enough pressure to force the whitehead or blackhead up out of the skin.
Re-sanitize the extractor before using it again.
Protect your opened pores.

Open up Adobe Flash, and make a new document.
Go to your layers, and label the first one whatever it is that you want the first animation to be.
Now that you have the circle made, press F8 (mac and PC) in order to bring up the convert to symbol box.
Go down to the properties panel on the bottom, and move to the color options.
Go back up to your Layers area, and right click on a keyframe that is between the 1st and last keyframe, and click on "Create Motion Tween".
Make a new layer, then name it "text" since that is what will be on there.
Now, go to the "circle" layer, and click on the 6th frame, then click and hold the frame, and drag it until the 16th keyframe.
Lock the circle layer, and hide it, as well, so that we can make sure that nothing will be damaged, and so that we can see what we are doing.
Once you have it positioned just where you want it, go up to the layer for "text", then, between the two keyframes, make it a motion tween by right clicking, then selecting "Create Motion Tween".
Go to where you want to save the animation, and name the animation "banner".
Congratulations!

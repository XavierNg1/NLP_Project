Try baking the meatballs directly in the red sauce for a moist, perfectly flavored dish.
Brown the outside of the meatballs and then freeze them if you need to cook ahead.
Use ground turkey or chicken meat for lower-fat meatballs.
Add a can of tomato paste before deglazing the pan for a richer, deeper colored sauce.
Add 1 chopped stalk of celery and one large chopped carrot with the onion for a more nuanced base.
Try adding some roasted red pepper for new flavor.

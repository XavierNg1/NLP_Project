To start the game, players shake their cups with the dice in them.
Players can look at their own dice, but they shouldn't be able to see anybody else's.
Players can also change their calls as others make theirs.
1s, also known as an ace, are wild, but there must be a mother die for this to be the case.
Eventually somebody will make what the next player believes to be an impossible call.
Any player who makes a call that is shown to be wrong loses.
The calls MUST keep going up until someone calls someone else a liar.

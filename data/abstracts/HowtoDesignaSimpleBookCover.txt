Look at books on the internet, at the bookstore or at the library for some ideas on how to design a book cover.
The simplest method is to align the title and the artwork to the left edge of the book.
A common style of alignment is where the title and artwork is centered.
For an interesting placement of the title, place it on the right side.
Simplify the design from the examples and design a simple book cover.
Use a round tip, black marker pen to draw.
Try other ideas, if you do not want to letter the title or draw the picture:


Print the title and use a font such as Times New Roman.
Finally, in the design process, take your time and enjoy the process.

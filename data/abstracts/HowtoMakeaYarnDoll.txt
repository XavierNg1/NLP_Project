Decide how tall you want the doll to be.

Loop yarn once around the cardboard lengthwise.

Tie a knot at the top to secure it.
Keep wrapping the yarn around the cardboard.

Slide a piece of string between the loops and the cardboard.

Slide the strings off of the cardboard.

Pull out a few loops on each side to form the doll's arms.

Tie the arms at the "wrists" and trim the looped yarn ends.
Cut across the bottom of the body to make a "skirt" of yarn.

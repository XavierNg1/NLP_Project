Remove two short 10mm bolts holding the power steering hose where it crosses the valve cover and work the hose toward the left out of the way.
Remove spark plugs - use a specialized spark plug socket with a rubber grommet inside which helps to lift plugs from the deep ports.
Once the plugs are out, prevent any objects from passing down the spark plug ports and into the cylinders.
Loosen the harmonic pulley retainer bolt (21mm) but keep it "finger-tight" (snug - do not remove it at this time).
In a pinch, consider using the power of the starter motor and power "bump method" to loosen the pulley bolt.

Sit down and relax your shoulders.
Write a list or think of things you really love doing, more than anything and plan when to do it.
Think of something totally different to do.
Tell the necessary people about your fun activity.
Speak to people who you know are often calm or who seem very organised.
Try out some relaxation techniques.
Stop pretending everything is OK. Maybe speaking to another busy friend from work would help and you could find something fun and calming to do together.

Remind yourself that you will not always feel this way and everything comes to an end.

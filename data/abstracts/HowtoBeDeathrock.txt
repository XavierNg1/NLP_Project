Deathrockers are huge music geeks, and lovers of obscure bands and equally obscure horror movies (especially zombie movies and supernatural thrillers).
Slowly begin to develop into the aesthetics of the music no matter how macabre it may seem to you.
Common punk attire and Mohawks (The common Deathrock variant known as the Deathhawk), Flamboyant make-up and clothes with a cryptic or macabre meaning are great.
Develop a satirical sense of humour, everything has a meaning no matter how cryptic it is and that can be used for or against you so you might as well use it for your own means.
Skepticism is the primary thing one needs to show often to an extreme level and ranging from anti-establishment/post modernism to anti-organized dogma.

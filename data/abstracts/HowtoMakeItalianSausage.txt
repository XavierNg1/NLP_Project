Buy 5 lbs.
Buy sausage casings.
Cut the 5 lbs (2.2kg) of pork shoulder into small pieces.
Place the ground meat in a large bowl.
Add your spices to the meat.
Put on plastic gloves.
Put plastic wrap over the top of the bowl.
Coat your sausage stuffing attachment with shortening.
Tie the end of your casing.
This portion of the process is best if done by more than 1 person, so that you can load the attachment, twist the sausage and have a smoother process.

,
Fill the casing until it is firm.
Tie off the end of the casing when you have only 3 inches (7.6cm) left.
Return to the beginning of the casing.
Prick each sausage with a pin to remove air bubbles.

Finished.

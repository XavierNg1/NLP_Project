Become friendly with your principal.
If you don't have a sketchbook, go to an art shop and buy two sketchbooks: one A3 size (for home) and a smaller A5 (to take around with you).
Research a particular time period that you like.
If possible, ask politely to look at old school yearbooks, magazines and old school uniform photos and archives.
Visit the school uniform shop - home in on the second-hand uniform section.
Once you have an idea in your head - sketch out any motifs you want to include.
Go to the fabric or textiles shop, or maybe a seamstress - and decide on the fabric you want to use.
In your sketchbook, lightly draw your design in pencil, conte crayons or oil pastels (if you're advanced).
Colour it in with colour pencils/watercolour inks.
Annotate your drawing.
Show your designs to a seamstress or dressmaker - preferably one that specialises in making school uniforms.

,
Sewing skills now come into play.
Make a replica of your dream uniform for a doll (preferably a Barbie doll).
Then go back to the principal and show your sewn uniform replica to the Principal.Show them what you can do - and amaze them with what you can do.
Get lots of publicity.
Have fun!

Choose an auger, also called a pipe snake.
Push the cable into the drain until it hits the obstruction and stops.
Turn the crank or use the motor to turn the bit clockwise.
Stop cranking when the bit stops turning.
Push on the auger to see if it pushes the obstruction through.
Watch to see if the drain becomes unclogged.
Consider working on large or stubborn obstructions from the other side.

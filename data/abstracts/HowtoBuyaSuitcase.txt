Think of how you travel.
Next, look at other pieces of luggage for ideas of what features you want.
Learn to pack and travel light.
Next consider the normal and over packed dimensions.
Donâ€™t try to plan for every situation.
As you shop online or in stores use your list to narrow down your choices.
Finally, once you decide on the piece consider what you can do to tweak it a little by adding tie down loops, extra attached cords, a waist strap if you have a backpack type with wheels, a stitch on exterior pocket for bottled water, or other things you might want.

Visual material.
Ask if you can advertise in your school paper and/or leave pamphlets/cards at stores where your goal-audience comes.
If you have a few songs, hand out free demo's and see if you can arrange something with a local radio station.

Once you start to get a little famous or when you are famous, don't get it all too high in your head.
Money doesn't buy happiness, it just buys things.
With the fame you've gotten, you have people listening to you.

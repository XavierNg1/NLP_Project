Obviously, the first step is to register for an autocross event.
Once you arrive at the track, you must register your car as present.
Once your car has been registered and teched, and you have been assigned a number, it is time to check out the course.
Once you feel you have a grasp of the course layout, apply what knowledge you have of your cars handling characteristics.
Using all that information, develop a plan on how you will attack the course.
After your first run, if everything went well, try to get faster and faster, by making your turns smoother and smoother.

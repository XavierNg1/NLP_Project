Head to the produce aisle at your grocery store and stock up on a bag of peeled baby carrots.
Maintain the carrots in the refrigerator to ensure they remain cold.
Provide one carrot when puppy seems to be getting mouthy but before he starts biting/attacking.
Ask puppy to sit before receiving the carrot.
Say, “Good girl/boy” when the puppy sits and offer the carrot with your hand.

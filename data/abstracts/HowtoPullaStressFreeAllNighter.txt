Be ready.
Dress appropriately.
Have a vegetable or two to perk you up.
Have a bottle of water with you.
Try listening to music.
Get your study area up to par.
During your study session, allow 2 minute revision breaks every 15 minutes of studying.
Then take a 2 minute break of walking and moving to get blood flowing.
Schedule yourself a 10 minute chunk of time to do whatever you want.
Don't punish yourself.
Don't forget to breathe, walk around during your breaks and allow some moments of empty thinking (like in yoga) to keep you sane.

One thing that's really quite lovely to do is if you go for a nice walk at the break of dawn.

,
Don't think about being in the exam.
When you're in the exam, use the 'think along' tip as well.
In sum, prepare YOURSELF first.
Be alert for the test.

When facing a broken wave, either scratch for the paddling channel or straight out.
Continue paddling if the broken wave is small.

,
Do a duck dive with small to medium sized broken waves.
Simply slipping off the board, is a little more work and does not look cool, but is actually very effective in not losing progress going out to the lineup.

,
With big waves, dive for the bottom with or without the board.
Beware of the reef.

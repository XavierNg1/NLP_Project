Prepare either the rocks or the grill by rubbing down the cooking surface with mutton fat or butter.
Start cooking the conger meat until it is soft and flaky.
Beat the eggs.
Mix in most of the oats.
Form the mixture into patties, being sure to squeeze any excess fluid from them.
Dust the excess oats over the patties.
Press the patties down onto your heated rock or grill.
Notice that once the cakes are fairly hard, they're ready.
Finished.

Use two sticks, a cord, and a rock to build a basic wilderness bird trap.
Sharpen both ends of the longer pole or stick.
Drill a hole through the pole at one of the ends.
Tie one end of the rope firmly around your rock.
Thread the string through the hole and tie a small knot in it.
Wedge the thinner stick into the hole you drilled, next to your knot.
Tie a slip noose knot in the end of the string to make your snare.
Thread the end of the rope through your noose, towards the pole.
Tie a simple overhand knot right where the two sticks meet.
Check your trap by gently pushing down on the perch.
Place your trap where it is the best place for a bird to land.
Note that small birds only provide minimal calories.

Find a restaurant that serves Stromboli!,
Bring a friend (at least one - the more friends, the better).
Order ahead: This will maximize your lunch hour and minimize your realized wait time!,
Prepare your drinks.
Split the Boli right down the middle to avoid any questions later about who got to eat more.

,
Prepare the sauce.
Choose your money piece!,
Do NOT eat your money piece until the end - this is a special piece and should ALWAYS be saved for the end!

,
When it is time (the entire Boli has been eaten with the exception of the money pieces), toast each other on a fantastic "Boli" experience and then eat your money pieces!,
Rate your Boli.
Finished.

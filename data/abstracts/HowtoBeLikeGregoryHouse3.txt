House's motto is "Everybody lies.",
Be a very diligent observer and use your observations to draw conclusions.
Be quick witted and be able to think on your feet.
Be sarcastic whenever necessary, which is very often.
Do not try to be polite or kind.
Only do things if it benefits you in some way.
Do not seek to have a large circle of friends, but rather a few really close ones.
While you may have emotions and pain, be stoic and do not express your emotions other than anger, irritation, etc and only complaining about extreme physical pain.

,
Be the best or one of the best at something you enjoy.

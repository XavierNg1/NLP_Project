Apply parking brake firmly.
Using the ratchet, ratchet extension(s) and 15mm socket, remove the front skid plate and set it aside.You may need to lower or raise the axle some to take pressure off of the lower link bolt, so that you can remove it easily at the appropriate step.

Using the ratchet and 17mm socket, loosen, but do not remove, the upper link nut.
Using the ratchet and 18mm socket, remove the lower through-bolt nut connecting the link to the axle.



 Old Link & New Link Side by Side (through-bolt nut NOT in picture)

Remove the upper link nut and remove the link and old bushings from the stabilizer/sway bar.



 Upper Link Assembly

To install the new links is pretty much a reversal of the removal process, but I suggest that you loosely secure the bolts and nuts at first to give them and the bushings a chance to "seat" properly before tightening to the final torque specs.

Once all the nuts, bolts, and bushings are properly installed and seated, begin the final tightening sequence using the torque wrench.Replace the wheels and lightly tighten the lug nuts.
Re-install the front skid plate and tighten the bolts to approximately 40 foot (12.2 m) pounds.Raise the vehicle slightly in order to remove the jack stands.Carefully lower the vehicle and tighten the lug nuts to 100 foot (30.5 m) pounds.After completing ANY repair on the vehicle suspension (and this is no exception), take the vehicle to a repair shop and have the alignment checked and/or adjusted by a properly trained professional.Sit back and take pride in all of your hard work!

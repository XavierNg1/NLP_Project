Use medium gauge, lightweight wire to create this simple wire dragonfly.
Decide on the length of the earrings before proceeding.
Using pliers, twist the wire into a small circle loop at one end.
Assemble approximately 5 medium sized beads along the length of the wire so that they sit on the tail loop.
Create the wings.
Continuing with the same piece of wire, straighten it up again.
Finish off the piece by creating a small circle as you did at the beginning to form the loop for the hook and to prevent the head bead from falling off.
Repeat for the second earring.

Add the earring hooks to each earring.

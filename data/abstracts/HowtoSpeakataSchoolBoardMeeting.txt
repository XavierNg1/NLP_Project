Decide what your goal is.
Think about going to a number of meetings before you ever speak, if you intend to become active in civics.

,
Decide on a topic or area that interests you, and watch what is happening in the meeting.
Determine if you will be just making a speech or if you will have to answer questions from the board.
Get in front of a mirror and practice, then after that get a friend or two to listen to the speech.

,
At the meeting, have a copy of the speech with you, but try not to refer to it.
Use inflection, breathing, and volume to make what you have to say sound as important to others as it is to you.
Keep it short.
Give just enough background so that your listeners understand why you are there and what you are talking about.
Make sure any exhibits you plan to use are organized and big enough for your audience to see.

,
Be sure your topic is appropriate to the board you are speaking before.
Be polite, do not be sarcastic, do not use a joke unless it is really hysterical.
After you finish your remarks, ask if there are any questions, answer them if you can.
Once all questions are handled, thank the board for its time, and return to your seat.

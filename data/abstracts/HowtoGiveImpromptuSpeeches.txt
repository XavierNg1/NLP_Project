Know what an impromptu speech is.
Be prepared.
Start with the easy and obvious if it makes it easier to start, e.g.
Relate to and connect with your audience.
Remember that you don't have to accept the premise on which you're invited to speak.
Avoid making statements, even in jest, which compromise your principles.
Use humour in proportion to your skill, Better a short and heartfelt speech than one laced with tasteless jokes that fall flat.

Use your three points, or an ending, moral or exhortation (also known as a "call to action") to draw together the threads of what you have said.

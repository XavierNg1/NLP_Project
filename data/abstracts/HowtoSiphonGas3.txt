Understand the danger of gasoline poisoning.
Obtain clear tubing that is 1 inch (2.5Â cm) in diameter and a closed gas container.
Feed one end of the tubing down into the vehicle's gas tank.
Place the free end of the tubing in your mouth.
Keep your fingers around the tubing near your mouth so you are ready to crimp it before gas enters your mouth.
Suck on the tubing and watch the gas flow into the tube.
Check for air bubbles in the tubing.
Stick the end of the tubing into the gas can and release your crimp.
Pull the tubing up out of the tank when you have nearly reached the desired amount of gas.
Remove the tubing from the gas container once all of the gas has flowed out.

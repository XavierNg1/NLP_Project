Remind yourself that rejection does not indicate failure.
Give yourself credit.
Develop your problem solving skills.
Put yourself out there.
Set yourself up for rejection frequently.
Give yourself time.
Put a cap on the process.
Smart small.
Ask for honest feedback from teachers and coworkers.
Question the consequences.
Donâ€™t just brush it off.
Turn it into a positive.

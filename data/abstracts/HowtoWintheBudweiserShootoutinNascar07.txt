Learn about the Budweiser Shootout.
Race in the "Big League".
The race proper for year 1 is just to win from the back of the grid, but in year 2, assuming you have won that race, you must make a 7-lap race count by making a compulsory pit-stop that changes 2 tires.

Set the car up for the race.
From year 2 onwards, you should take to the pits at the end of lap 1, and change two tires only.
Gain as many positions without enforcing a yellow flag.
Drive your heart out once you leave the pit stop area as if you are going for an extended qualifying session.
Celebrate after your victories.

Try making one yourself and setting a bucket trap.
Drill holes at the top of the bucket, on 2 opposite sides.
Drill holes in the middle of each flat side of the can.
Insert the dowel through the can and fix it in place on the bucket.
Smear some peanut butter on the can and add a ramp for the mice to get up.

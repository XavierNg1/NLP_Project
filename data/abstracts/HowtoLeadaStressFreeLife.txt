First, stop and sit down and think and make a list of all the stressful things in your life.
How do you know if you're under stress, not just by how you feel?,
If you feel like you need a break in life try doing this: Treat yourself to something warm and tasty (be sure it's something healthy though, unhealthy foods just add to stress!),
Try just taking deep breaths every once in a while.
When you are alone, talk out loud about what you have to get done.
Try keeping peace with people at home and at work, school, etc.
Keep a healthy diet!,
Keep hydrated!,
Keep negative thoughts out please!,
Exercise helps a lot.
Try keeping a regular schedule each day.
Have a clean healthy life style.

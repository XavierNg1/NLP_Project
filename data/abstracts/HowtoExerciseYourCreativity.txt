Stand in the middle of a room.
Walk outside.
Change up natural colors.
Can't think up that good main character name for a story or play?,
See mirrors, pictures, TV's, and computer screens as doors/gateways.

Think up a random animal.
Close your eyes and image a blue circle with a white background.
Combine two random things together like a fishing and pole vaulting.
Close your eyes and draw something from memory.
"Do penguins have knees?"

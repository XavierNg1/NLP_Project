Feather the selection (Select -> Feather).

Run the diffusion filter (Script-Fu -> Photo -> Diffusion filter; if you don't have this, then you haven't installed the Diffusion Filter script as per the Things You'll Need section).
Bring up the Layers dialog (Dialogs -> Layers).
Decompose the image (Filters -> Colors -> Decompose, use the "RGB" option).
On this new image, bring up the Layers dialog.Merge the layers until you're left with one layer.Select the entire black and white image and copy it to the clipboard (Ctrl+A then Ctrl+C).
Go back to the original image window (the one you ran the diffusion filter on earlier).

Save the gradients in the images to the right and open them in the GIMP.
Select the BW1 layer in the Layers dialog by clicking it.
On the right hand side, select the BW1Tone.png as your sample.
Select the BW2 layer, make it visible and turn off the visibility of the other layers (using the "eye" icon again).
Select the BW1 layer again and make it visible.
Select the bottom layer (which if you have done everything right, should be called "blur" if you haven't renamed it).
Boost the brightness and saturation of the bottom layer by going to Tools -> Color Tools -> Hue/Saturation.
Make the BW1 layer visible again.
Select the BW2 layer and make it visible.Optionally, select the bottom layer and adjust the saturation until it looks right to you.
Merge down the BW1 layer, then the BW2 layer.

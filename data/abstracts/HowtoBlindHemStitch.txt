Try on the garment (right side out) in front of a full-length mirror and decide on a desired length for the hem.
Remove the garment and mark the desired hemline around the leg or skirt.
Decide how deep you want your hem, and mark a line that distance above and below the hemline.
Trim the raw edge, leaving about 1 inch below your lowest line.
Fold the raw edge in and press with an iron.
Tuck the fabric under along the middle line so that it now forms the hemline.
Cuff the hem by folding along the line above the hem and pin.
Press the folds lightly with an iron.
Check that your sewing machine has a blind hem presser foot in its collection.
Attach the blind hem presser foot to the sewing machine.
Set the machine to the blind hem stitch setting.
Turn the fabric wrong side up (inside out, in other words) and position it on the sewing machine.
Stitch slowly.
Inspect your work.
Remove the pins and press the hem.

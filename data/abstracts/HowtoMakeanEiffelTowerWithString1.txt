Be prepared to try a few times.
Find a suitable piece of string.
Set up your computer.
Tie the ends of the string together in a knot.
Begin your string figure.
Take the pointer finger of either hand and hook the string on the opposite hand with it.
Move each thumb toward the pinkie on the same hand, going over the two closest strings and then looping under the third string.
Release the lower loop from your thumbs.
Release the loops that are on your pinkies, gradually pulling the string figure taut as you release them.
Rotate your hands so that your thumbs are on top.
Loosen the cup and saucer figure by moving your hands closer together.
Clasp the string stretched between your thumbs with your teeth.
Release the loops on your thumbs slowly as you pull the loop with you teeth toward your finger tips.
Practice if needed.

Know what time the Mass is, how far away your parish is, and what time you will need to leave.
Decide whether to attend the earlier Mass or later Mass (if your parish has two).
Arrive about 10 minutes early so you can find good seats and pray before Mass starts.
When Mass starts, stand and sing the Entrance Hymn.
Listen to the readings and the Gospel.
Listen to the Homily.
Again, listen to the petitions!,
Pay attention to the rest of the Mass!,
When it is time for Communion, only come if you have received the Sacrament.
Almost over!,
Listen to the Ending Prayer, sing the Closing Hymn, and congratulations, you survived a Catholic Mass!

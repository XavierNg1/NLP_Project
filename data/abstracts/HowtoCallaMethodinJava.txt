A method is the equivalent of a function in languages like C which helps in code reusing.
The word public before the method name means that the method itself can be called from anywhere which includes other classes, even from different packages (files) as long as you import the class.
The second keyword, static means that the method belongs to the class and not any instance of the class ( object ).
The last word before the method name is void.
When calling a method that returns something, you can use what it returns.
Some methods require a parameter.
Methods can also have multiple parameters, simply separated by commas.

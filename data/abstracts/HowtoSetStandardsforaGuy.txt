Know yourself, your dignity.
Know your likes and dislikes.
Dress modestly.
Hang out with a guy who wants to be your friend not your lover from the first sight.
Stop him at that moment you catch him disrespecting you.
Don't set a guy to be your #1.
Choose a guy who's morally good and wants the best for you.
Test him.
Don't waste time with someone who can't accept you for who you are.

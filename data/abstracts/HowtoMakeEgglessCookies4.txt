Try a flax egg if you are making oatmeal cookies.
Use Â¼ cup (60 milliliters) of vegetable oil to replace one egg.If the recipe calls for more than one egg, you will have to use a different substitute, or it will make the cookies too oily.Alternatively, you can also use 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of water, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil.
Try silken tofu if you don't care about the cookies being browned.
Use a commercial egg replacer, such as Ener-G Egg Replacer if you want crispy cookies.You will need to follow the instructions on the package, as each brand will be a little different.
Try sweetened condensed milk with care.
Use aquafaba if you need egg whites.
Try cornstarch and soy milk powder.

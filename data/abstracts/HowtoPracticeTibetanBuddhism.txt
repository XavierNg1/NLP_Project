Read as many of the Dalai Lama's books as possible.
Be patient.
Meditate.
Realize that higher teachings are worthless if you can't even practice the most basic teachings, such as ethics (avoiding the ten non-virtuous actions).
Think of Tibetan Buddhism as being like a pyramid.
Know that Tibetan Buddhism contains teachings for people of all different kinds of dispositions, it has advanced philosophical teachings for those of an intellectual bent, it has more mystical experiential meditative teachings for those of a more Zen-like orientation, and it has energy practices (in Vajrayana) for moving wind (prana, chi, ki) for health and mental clarity and spiritual realization, this is like Tai Chi and Hindu yoga (for those who want a Buddhist practice with emphasis on the health of the physical body).
Learn about the Lamrim and practice the basics first.

Make a strong and sustained effort to learn about and generate Bodhicitta in your mind and heart, Bodhicitta is one of the most important aspects of Tibetan Buddhism, (although not a distinguishing aspects, as all Mahayana Buddhists are defined as such by possessing Bodhicitta).Practice the Tonglen everyday to develop compassion and create positive karma

Find a Tibetan Lama or Rinpoche to teach you even further than you could by yourself, especially if you want certain empowerments.

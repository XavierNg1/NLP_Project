Straighten your hair.
Section the hair in the middle.
Take a strip of hair from each side of the head along the sectioned line in the middle.
Section the strip of hair into three sections.

,
Take another strip of hair right above the three sections and weave it in as a normal three-strand braid.
Lace in the strips of hair into the original one at least two or three times.
Keep adding in strips of hair until you reach the lower middle section of the head.
Make sure the braid reaches all the way to the bottom of the back of the head and that it is really tight.
Done!,
Finished.

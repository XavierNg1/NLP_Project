Go to the Grand Exchange page on the RuneScape website and check the price of the rune armour set and whatever rune weapon you want to use.
Once you have your prices, you're going to have to earn some money somehow.
When you have the money you need, go to the Grand Exchange and buy a rune armour set.
After that, all you have to do is wait.

Set the scene for the proposal.
Try to keep things quiet.
Kiss your date underneath the mistletoe.
Have her unwrap some of her gifts.
Tell her that there is one last gift that you want her to open (as you open up the gift-wrapping).
Tell her that you love her with all your heart, and that you'd like to spend the whole rest of your life with her.
Get down on your knee as you open up the ring box.
Let her accept the invitation.
Give her another kiss under the mistletoe.

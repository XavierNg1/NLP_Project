Decide where you want to go and what kind of boat you want to rent.
Make reservations.
Try to plan your route in advance for longer trips.
Hire a captain or captain the boat yourself.
If you're considering a "bareboat" charter, especially in saltwater, where you are the captain, you must meet basic standards the companies set for experience and competence on the size and type of boat you'd like to charter.
Review boat safety procedures.

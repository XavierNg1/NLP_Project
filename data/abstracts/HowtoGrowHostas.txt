Purchase field-grown hosta plants.
Choose an area in the yard that receives partial sun.
Prepare the soil.
Space hosta plants in the garden 10 to 24 inches (25 to 60 cm).
Mulch the soil around the hosta plants to help it retain moisture and keep down weeds.
Water hosta plants regularly.
Divide your hosta plants to create new plants if they start to overcrowd.

Sift the flour and cream of tartar together into a bowl.
In a medium bowl, mix the yeast and the sugar together with Â¾ of a cup of warm water, and let stand until the water becomes foamy.
Mix the yeast mixture into the flour mixture, and beat vigorously for two minutes, or until you get a thick, yet smooth batter.

,
Cover the bowl with cling wrap and let it stand in a warm spot until the batter rises and then falls.
Add the salt to the batter, and beat for about 1 minute.
Mix the baking soda and warm milk together in a mug; then, gently stir it into the batter.

,
Heat an oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-low heat for two to three minutes.

,
Put a greased crumpet ring onto the griddle/frying pan, and spoon about 1/3 of a cup of the batter into the ring.
Watch for holes.
Flip the crumpet.
Cook the second side of the crumpet until it turns pale golden brown.
Serve the warm crumpets with your topping.

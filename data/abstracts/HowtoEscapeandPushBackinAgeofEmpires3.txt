Decide if you want to build a rescue base.
So start building a rescue base when you know that your economy is bad, your troops are not that good and the whole structure of your village is impossible to handle, and then start to send villagers to build a rescue base.
Pick a spot.
Don't let the enemy realize that you sent villagers to build a new base.
If you found a good location, build walls to mark how big the base should be.
The enemy will realize very fast that you have built a new base because he hasn't won already, so he will look for it.

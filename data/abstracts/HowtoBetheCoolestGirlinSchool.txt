Don't concern yourself too much with popularity!,
Start by thinking what it is you don't like about what your classmates think of you.
Looking good is the key.
Make sure your hair is looking good too.
Think about the way you act and talk to people.
Be friendly to everyone but make sure you have some true friends who you trust, The sad thing about being 'popular' is that you often don't have any real friends, just hangers on.

,
Have your own Unique sent.
It is all about mind control.
Lets others speak, and listen.
Do not be to controlling.
Make sure you involve everyone!,
And if someone hurts your feelings then just leave them alone and if you have the chance talk about the problem and asked them why and try to fix it!

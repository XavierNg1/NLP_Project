Put the most popular band on last, and the least popular first.

,
Give each starting band equal stage time; the final two bands should get a little extra time.

,
Tell the bands they prepare their set for extra 5 minutes longer or 5 minutes shorter than they actually have.
Organising gear requirements, gear sharing and sound check times is tricky.
Allow bands to sell CDs and merchandise if possible during breaks and after the show.
Stay within the venue's time restraints.

,
Generally leave 15 minutes between each band for setting up.
Play music during the breaks.

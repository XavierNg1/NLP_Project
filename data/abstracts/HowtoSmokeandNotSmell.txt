First of all, lets go over what smells the most: Hair, clothes, body, breath, and hands.
For the hair: Wear a hat that you can deodorize, or pull your hair back.
For clothes, the best thing to do is to have a change of clothes, but you can't always do that.
Believe it or not your body doesn't smell as much as you might think (at least from the smokeÂ :P).
For your breath, obviously you want to use mints or gum.
Smokers know that hands smell, and often times that's the first place they check.
Finally, USE A SPLOOF!

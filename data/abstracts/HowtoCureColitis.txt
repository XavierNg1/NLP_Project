Seek medical attention immediately.
Get checked for an infection.Infectious colitis results from any type of infection — bacterial, viral, or parasitic.

Think about whether you have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Talk to your doctor about biologic therapies.Though it may sound "natural" or "herbal," biologic therapies take their name from the fact that they're developed from biological material — usually protein.

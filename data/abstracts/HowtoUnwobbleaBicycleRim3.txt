Know when a rim is damaged and not simply out of true.
Tighten any extra-loose spokes until they feel as tense as the rest, then make the finer adjustments.
Make sure the wheel is seated perfectly and the brakes are even if you can't seem to true the bike.
Replace any broken spokes as soon as you can, as one broken spoke often leads to more.

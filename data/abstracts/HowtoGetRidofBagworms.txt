Begin looking for bagworms during the winter or early spring.
Sweep and rake under trees regularly to get rid of fallen egg sacks.
Notice areas of dead pine needles or branches.
Observe new places the bagworms may live.
Fill a plastic bucket with a mixture of warm water and dish soap.
Put on garden gloves and bring a small pair of clippers to aid you in removing the bagworms entirely.
Lift branches, clip off bagworm egg sacks and drop them into the bucket of soapy water.
Dump the soaked bagworms into a sealed plastic sack and throw them in your dumpster.

Repeat this procedure every fall, winter and early spring to reduce bagworm populations before the eggs hatch.
Plan to treat bagworms with insecticide in May.
Look for a small, worm-like head poking out of the top of the sack.
Purchase an insecticide such as Dipel or Thuricide.
Put the insecticide in a sprayer.
Spray insecticide in late May, June and early July.

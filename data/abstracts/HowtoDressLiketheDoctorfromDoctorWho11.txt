Take a look at David Tennant's dress sense.
Get either a blue or brown pinstripe suit with four buttons (preferably blue pinstripes for the brown suit, and rust pinstripes for the blue suit).
Add a tie - the different ones he had varied, so you have a few choices.
Add a shirt.
Get the right shoes.
Style your hair just right.
Alternatively, if you have a black tie event you are attending and would like to dress like the Tenth Doctor, I'd suggest getting a black, single button tuxedo with notch lapels, and wearing a white dress shirt with a black bow tie and black high top converse/Chuck Taylors (with a white sole, laces and stitching).
Amp it up with accessories.
You're done.

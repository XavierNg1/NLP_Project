Get toxins out: You may need to pass BMs (bowel movements) 6, 8,10 or more times per day to get the toxins out -- while being treated with special antibiotics that can eliminate C-Diff (more in the "Treatment" section).
Do not take antibiotics unnecessarily.Due to the risk that antibiotics put you at for developing Clostridium difficile, it is important to take them only when they are needed.
Expect, with mild to moderate infection with C-Diff, doctors may prescribe a special antibiotic such as metronidazole (Flagyl), taken by mouth (or by IV if in the hospital).
Wash your hands regularly.One of the main ways in which Clostridium difficile infections are caught is by touching surfaces that are contaminated with spores from the bacteria.
Avoid sharing the same home-/work-space and surfaces with someone who has diarrhea.
Contact your doctor to prevent establishing C-Diff and C-dificille-colitis, even if the diarrhea is relatively mild when you are currently taking or have recently taken antibiotics and you develop diarrhea.

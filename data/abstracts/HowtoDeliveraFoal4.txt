Call the veterinarian if you suspect your mare is having trouble foaling due to dystocia.

,
Get the mare up, if possible.
Don't wait for the vet to arrive.
Wash your hands, glove up and lube up.
Reach in through the vagina and determine what presentation the foal is in.
The sooner you get the foal out, the better!

Find a good spot to install these things.Go to a local lumberyard or hardware store and get some 1–2 foot (0.3–0.6 m) pieces of a hardwood board like oak, maple or poplar.
Cut the boards in small sections.sand off any sharp corners, but you want to retain the cube shape so your shoes get a nice grip,
Put your piece up against a wall as if you were going to bolt it in place.
Wear away at the piece.
Drill three holes in the piece that will be used to attach it to what your climbing.
Get some 1/4" screws that you think are long enough and drill the piece into what your climbing.Test each hold until you are confident with them and make any necessary changes.

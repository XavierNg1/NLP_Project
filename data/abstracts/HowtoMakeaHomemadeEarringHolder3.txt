Take an embroidery hoop apart.
Paint the hoops, if desired, and wait for the paint to dry.
Cut a piece of lace or tulle a few inches larger than your hoop.
Place the lace on top of the inner hoop.
Place the upper hoop on top, and tighten it.
Trim off the excess lace using a pair of fabric scissors.
Thread some ribbon through the metal closure, and tie it in a knot.
Hang and use your earring holder.

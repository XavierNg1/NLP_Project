Make sure you have a working VPN Connection.
Find a Socks V5 Proxy Server that is up and running.
Have the Vuze torrent client installed: http://www.vuze.com.
Once Vuze has opened, go to the menubar.
Look for a new screen that now becomes visible.
Unfold the category "Connection".
In the same category "Connection", click on "proxy".
In the same "proxy" window, the next step is to:


Copy the proxy IP address in the "Host" field
Copy the port number (like 1080, 443, 60088, etc) into its corresponding field
Click on the "test SOCKS" button and see if it works.
Close the options menu.
When binding Vuze to the TAP adapter, it changes your IP for everything within Vuze.
Unfold the category "Plugins", and click on "Media Server".
If you do not untick this option, your IP address will be 10.X.X.X when trying to stream from Vuze to VLC (while downloading, etc.).

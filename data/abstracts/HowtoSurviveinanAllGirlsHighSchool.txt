Never discount the importance of the first day.
Get those cute school supplies and the right ones.
Watch your appearance.
Keep breath mints or Listerine breath strips in your bag.
Be aware of cliques and their place, but don't place too much value in them.
Watch your grades.
Boys, yes, boys.
Avoid the drama.

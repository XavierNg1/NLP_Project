Realise there are three types of aging.
Have an idea what to expect.
Mentally you need to take care of your mind; reading newspapers and keeping up to date with current affairs is a brilliant way to keep your mind sharp; sudoku is also brilliant as well.
Consider revising your skin care routine.
Find a haircut that suits your face.
Try not to let your hair frizz.
Try finding a good foundation.
When applying makeup try not to put any mascara on your bottom lashes.
Try penciling your eyebrows.
Cleanse, tone and moisturize, as you hopefully have been for the last 43 years or so.
Dress well.
Also, if it suits you, try the exotic look - bright colours and flowing chiffons really are incredibly flattering.

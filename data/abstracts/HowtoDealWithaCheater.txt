First and foremost - take a deep breath and some time.
Talk to someone.
Do not blame yourself.
Determine whether you were actually cheated on.
Talk to your partner.
Ask yourself if you will ever be able to look at your partner the same way.
If you decide this is irreconcilable, don't break up with your partner and later take him/her back.
If you are married and pretty sure a more-than-casual relationship is happening, you might need to consider an attorney or a reputable detective in the area that specializes in domestic cases.
If you do use an investigator, do not confront or accuse your partner.
Get tested for STD's as soon as possible.
If you can, collect evidence (receipts, emails, photographs, etc.),
Don't start rumors.
Look at your own personal actions, too.
Turnabout is not fair play.

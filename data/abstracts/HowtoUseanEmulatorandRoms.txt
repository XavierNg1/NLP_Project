Find an emulator of the video game console you are wanting to play on your computer.
Once you have found the emulator you wish to use, download it.
Remember that emulators are only part of what you need to play games on your computer.
Once you have found the ROM you wish to play on the Emulator, download it.
ROMS mostly come in compressed formats, such as ZIP or RAR.
Some emulators have a folder set as the default for games, so make sure the ROM file goes in that folder.
Pick the game you want to play (The ROM file).

,
Enjoy!

Check to see that your data meets the following criteria:


Data should usually be normally distributed revolving around a mean (average).
Find the mean of each subgroup.
Find the mean of all of the means from the previous step (X).
Calculate the standard deviation (S) of the data points (see tips).

,
Calculate the upper and lower control limits (UCL, LCL) using the following formula:


UCL = CL + 3*S






LCL = CL â€“ 3*S






The formula represents 3 standard deviations above and 3 standard deviations below the mean respectively.







,
Refer to the below chart with steps 7 through 10.

,
Draw a line at each deviation.
Graph the X-bar Control Chart, by graphing the subgroup means (x-axis) verses measurements (y-axis).
Evaluate the graph to see if the process is out-of-control.State whether the system is in-control or out-of-control.

Sharpen your pencil.
Look at the picture closely.
Lightly draw the person's basic head shape.
When you have done the basic outline, add small details, like the eye shape or an outline for the lips.
When you have done basic facial features, slowly add detail.
When you have finished the facial features, work on the hairline.
When you have completed the hair, work on the body and clothes.
When you have done everything, start to draw a shadow.
You're done!

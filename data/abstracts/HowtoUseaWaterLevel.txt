Purchase or make your own water level.
Fill the jug with water, and place it on a high surface.
Attach one end of the tube to the jug, and place your mouth on the other end.
Pull out the tube from the water bucket once it is nearly full.
Hold both ends of the tube vertically so that no water can escape.
Have a helper stand at the location you want to level.
Use chalk to mark the spot on the wall where the water line inside the tube falls.
Repeat the leveling process until you have reached the end of the surface you are leveling.

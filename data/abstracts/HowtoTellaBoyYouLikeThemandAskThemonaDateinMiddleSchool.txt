Walk past him a few times during the day, without 'noticing' him.
Smile at him once in a while, like when you walk past him or see him looking at you. 

,
Say "Hi" to him in the mornings.
'Accidentally' walk into him or cross his path and nearly hit him, after pretending to be distracted by something else. 

,
Look at him and then away quickly.
Spend time where he does, but not obsessively.
Strike up a conversation with him about something like how much homework he is receiving.
Flirt a little with him, like, if he told you a funny joke, giggle cutely.
Try the distracted method.
Be a little mysterious- don't blab everything about yourself to him in the first few conversations. 

,
If he teases you, he may like you back.
If you think he does like you back, ask him out to a movie or lunch.
Be different.
Use the natural assets you have and flatter them by wearing clothes or styling your hair in a way that suits you.
Laugh and smile a lot when he is near or if you are talking to him.
If he compliments you and you really like him, chances are you are going to blush and smile shyly.
Ask his friends about him openly- it will show them that you like him, and they will probably blab to him about it later.
Be friendly and open to him.
Do something 'absentmindedly' around him- like, if you are reading, twirl your hair or drum your fingers lightly on your seat or play with your necklace/earrings. 

,
BE YOURSELF.

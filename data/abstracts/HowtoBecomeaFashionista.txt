Do your "homework" on fashion.
While you are doing your "homework", keep a journal with all of the looks and clothes that you like.
Check out the items of clothing, jewellery, accessories, etc that you already have and see if there is anything that you can use.
Have good hygiene.
Buy some stylish clothing based on the information in your journal.
Get a unique or cool hairstyle that suits you.
Don't forget to accessorize and wear good shoes.
Put every thing together.
Now that you are a fashionista, keep up with the trends but remember to always be you!

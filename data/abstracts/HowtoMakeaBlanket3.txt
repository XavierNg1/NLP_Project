Choose your yarn and crochet hook size.
Decide whether you want to make a single crochet or a double crochet blanket.
Make a foundation chain of stitches along your needle.
To make a single crochet stitch, wrap the end of the yarn around the hook.
At the end of the row, flip your work so that the last stitch made is now the first stitch to be worked for the next row.
Continue this process until you have about a foot of yarn left.
Cut the leftover yarn down to about six inches and thread it through your needle, pulling it through the last loop on your crochet hook.

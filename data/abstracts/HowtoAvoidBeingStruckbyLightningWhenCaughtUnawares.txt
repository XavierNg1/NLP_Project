Seek some form of shelter ASAP.
Know what to do depending on the shelter type you have sought:
Car - if you are in a car, you are safe; lightning travels through the metal frame of the car to the ground, and not through you.
If there is no shelter at all nearby, crouch in a low lying ditch.
Never hide under a tree during a storm.
Note that lightning often strikes the same place twice, so don't go thinking that if you see lightning hit something, you should go there for safety.
Be patient.

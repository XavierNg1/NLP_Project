Diminish your time spent at the computer.Because repetitive strain injury (RSI) in the wrists, arms, or fingers is often caused by ongoing computer use, the less time you spend on your computer as you are trying to recover the better.
Modify your work environment.
Take regular breaks.Especially if you are unable to change your work duties and need to be on the computer for most of the day, it is important that you prioritize breaks every one to two hours to get up and walk around.
Consider the psychosocial factors at your workplace.Stress at the workplace has been consistently linked to worse RSI, as well as to reduced speed of healing of the condition.
Begin a regular exercise routine.Many people do not immediately think of an exercise routine as a potential solution to their RSI.
See a physiotherapist or a physician sooner rather than later.If you find that your RSI has persisted beyond a few weeks without improvement, it is best to seek professional help sooner rather than later.

First time in the car.
Take Driver's Ed.
Before you take the written test / skills test.
You have your license, but still feel anxious.
In the early stages, it is best to stick with destinations you know and not to attempt to drive for long distances in unfamiliar terrain.
When you do decide to go somewhere new, take a passenger with you the first time.
Focus on one thing at a time.
Don't worry about other people.
It is good practice to always signal ahead of making a turn.
Remind yourself that you passed the test, you have your license and you can do it!,
If you've caused / almost caused an accident.
Reassure yourself that you are okay and that these things happen.

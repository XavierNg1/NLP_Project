Open the compact and place it in a plastic, resealable bag.
Break the compact up into a fine powder, including the not broken parts.
Take the broken compact out of the bag, or pull the plastic wrap off.
Add some rubbing alcohol to the powder.
Let the rubbing alcohol soak in for a few seconds, then smoosh it around.You can use the end of a makeup brush or a mini spatula to do this.
Place a piece of plastic wrap over the wet powder, then smooth it down with your finger to shape it.
Remove the plastic wrap, and press down on the powder with a tissue.
Remove the tissue, and clean up the edges with a thin brush, if desired.
Leave the compact open, and let the powder dry overnight.During this time rubbing alcohol will evaporate, leaving behind the caked powder.

Clean up the compact using a q-tip dipped in rubbing alcohol, if desired.While you were restoring your broken powder, you may have gotten some makeup powder "mud" on your compact case.

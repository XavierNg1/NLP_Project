Go to iTunes and install Skitch.
Once it is installed, open up the app.
Once you have your image that you plan on using, look the bottom right side of your screen.
Crop it smaller if you need it that way.
If you have names, faces, emails, or anything that you wish to keep from prying eyes, use the tool directly to the left of the crop tool and use it to block out the required info.

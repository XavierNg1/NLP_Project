Follow your heart.
Choose what you are interested in.
Take suggestions, but never let others decide for you.It is good to take suggestion from someone experienced because it helps us when we are confused but remember never let their suggestions be your final choice.
Always believe in your abilities.
Never do something because a friend did.
Never be confused between two streams.
Always be sure of what you finalize: Once you have decided what to choose be sure of that.

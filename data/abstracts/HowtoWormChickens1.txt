Check chicken droppings for signs of worms.
Send the feces to a veterinarian if your chickens are losing weight or having other problems and you don’t see signs of worms in their feces.
Purchase a package of food-grade diatomaceous earth.
Add 1/4 cup of diatomaceous earth per 35 oz.
Repeat for four or five days to create an unattractive environment for parasitic worms.
Treat the worms with vet-prescribed medication if chickens aren’t wormed in a week.

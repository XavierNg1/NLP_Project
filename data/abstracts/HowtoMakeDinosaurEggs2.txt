Gather small dinosaurs.You can create “hatching” dinosaur eggs by forming a non-edible dough around plastic dinosaur toys.
Mix dry ingredients.Prepare to make your eggs by mixing together 2 ½ cups flour, 2 ½ cups dirt, 1 cup sand, and 1 ½ cups salt.
Add water.Gradually add clean water to the dry ingredients.
Enclose the plastic dinosaurs.Take each plastic dinosaur and wrap it in some of the dough.
Let the eggs dry.It may take several days for your dinosaur eggs to dry hard to the touch, depending on how wet the dough was, and on how high the humidity in your area is.
Crack the eggs.The thoroughly dry eggs can be cracked open using a hammer to “hatch” the dinosaur inside.

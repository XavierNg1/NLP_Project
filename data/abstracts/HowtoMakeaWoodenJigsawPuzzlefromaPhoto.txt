Begin by selecting the type of photo, picture or art that you wish to make the puzzle from.
Decide on the size of the puzzle that you wish to make, which will usually depend on the size of photo that you plan on using for the puzzle.
Select a good quality plywood substrate no thinner than a 1/4" thick.
Prepare the substrate by making sure that all imperfections are filled with a quality wood filler.
Glue the desired photo to the substrate.

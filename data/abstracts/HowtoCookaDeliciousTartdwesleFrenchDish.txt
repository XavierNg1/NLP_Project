The tartare "body" is one of the hardest parts to cook (not that the recipe is elaborate, on the contrary), okay, the only hard part to cook.
What you need for the tartare "body" is: The White Chocolate, the eggs, the flour (two spoons) and milk (one spoon).
Cook the lobster (don't worry if the "body" didn't take the whole bowl, it's not supposed to).
Now, get the lime risps and the orange risps, make any juice fall into the lobster, and put them together in the plate.

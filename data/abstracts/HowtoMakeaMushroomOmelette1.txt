Wash the mushrooms and cut them into thin slices.
Heat 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of unsalted butter in a medium-sized frying pan over medium heat.
When the butter starts to sizzle, add the mushrooms, some salt, and some pepper.
Fry the mushrooms until they turn soft and brown.
Remove the mushrooms from the pan, and set them aside.

Practice what you're singing.
Don't strain yourself trying to go too low, or too high.
Practice around a close friend, or family member.
Singing is like acting.
If you're not a loud singer, try to sing louder.
Don't let comments like, " You can't sing!",
Try to imagine the audience in their underwear.

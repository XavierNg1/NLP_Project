Use a square piece of paper.
Begin with the colored side of your paper facing up.Traditional origami paper is colored on one side and white on the other.
Fold your paper in half top to bottom and left to right.This should form the shape of a cross that passes through the middle of your paper.
Fold an X on the back side of your paper.Turn your paper so that the reverse side is facing up.
Collapse the sides to form a triangle and complete the base.At this point you should have folds folds forming a cross and an X on your paper, with the reverse side should facing up.
Fold the outside flaps to line up with the center crease.There should be a fold that you can still see running down the center of your waterbomb base.
Fold the outside corners of the outer flaps inward.You can do this by taking the left flap and pulling it over to the right side.
Join opposite side flaps together.The flaps that you've just folded on both sides to meet in the middle should have slightly different edges.
Blow up your tulip bulb.Next you'll need to inflate your tulip bulb by blowing air into it, but you'll have to use your forefinger and thumb to hold the overlapping seam where you tucked your flaps together.
Peel the petals of your tulip back for a realistic effect.The top of your now-inflated tulip bulb should have "petals," or extra layers of paper, on each of the four sides of your bulb.

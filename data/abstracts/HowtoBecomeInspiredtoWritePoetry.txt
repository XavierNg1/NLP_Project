"Love is no word, but a feeling too absurd to explain.",
Be in tune with your feelings and allow your emotions to stir within you.
Sit somewhere that inspires you.
Don't stop if you feel you are misspelling a word.
Relax.
Sit back and read what you have written, correcting only the spelling.
Read what you wrote, and read it to others if it is not too personal.
Write what you feel.
Never try to force poetry out of yourself.

Find a donor Furby to do this.
Remove the fur from the working Furby.
Flip around your working Furby so that you are looking at his back.
Unscrew both screws from the base of where the ears are.
Carefully remove the red cover and put it with the screws.
Holding the base of the ear, you now want to wiggle the ear off.
Repeat steps 2 to 6 to your donor Furby.
The next part is the easiest yet!,
Put the covering back onto the base of the ears.
Before putting Furby back together, pop in some batteries and make sure the new ear works.
Pop the batteries back out and reassemble your Furby.

Choose a portfolio format.
Go through your body of work.
Assess the quality of each photo individually.As you examine each image, think about whether or not it represents your chosen concept.
Be consistent.
Remove any flawed or repetitive images.Get rid of images that are out of focus or that have visible flaws.

Settle on ten to twenty final images.There isn’t a specific number of images a portfolio should include and opinions about this tend to vary.
Tweak your final images if necessary.
Organize the images into a particular sequence.There is no “right” way to order your images.
Use high quality materials.
Put the photos into your portfolio.

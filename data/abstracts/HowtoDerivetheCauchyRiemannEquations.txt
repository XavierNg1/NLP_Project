Define the complex limit.
Define the complex derivative.
Set Δz=Δx{\displaystyle \Delta z=\Delta x}.
Substitute Δz=Δx{\displaystyle \Delta z=\Delta x} into the definition of the derivative and simplify.
Set Δz=iΔy{\displaystyle \Delta z=i\Delta y}.
Substitute Δz=iΔy{\displaystyle \Delta z=i\Delta y} into the definition of the derivative and simplify.
Equate the real and imaginary parts of the derivative.

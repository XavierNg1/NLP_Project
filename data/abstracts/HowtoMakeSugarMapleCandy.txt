Decide what texture of candy you want.
Pour the maple syrup into a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan.
Insert a candy thermometer into the boiling syrup.
Gradually bring the syrup to a rolling boil over medium heat.
Heat the candy until it reaches the soft-ball stage, 235–240 °F (113–116 °C).
When the candy reaches the appropriate temperature, remove the pan from the heat immediately.
Use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture rapidly until the color turns lighter.
Pour the candy into lightly greased molds or a pan lined with waxed paper.
Once cool, take the candy out of the molds and enjoy!

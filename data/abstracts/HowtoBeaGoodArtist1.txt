Break down your chosen art form into the essential components or skills.
Practice your art every single day, making it a daily habit.
Take an honest appraisal of your artistic weakness, to practice with mindfulness.
Take on smaller projects, or "studies" to help you ramp up to your big projects.
When in doubt, practice realism, even if it isn't your artistic form of choice.Say you love to make impressionist, brightly-colored portraits in the style of Vincent Van Gogh, or abstract, cubist paintings like Picasso.

Take either an All County Express or ETS Air Shuttlevan from either airport.
Take an MTA E-60 or Q-70 bus to either the ROOSEVELT AVE & 74TH ST (Q-70 line) or W 125TH ST & MALCOLM X BLVD(M60+) then transfer to the subway, that head towards Penn Station.
Take your own personal car if you have one or you know where you can pick one up.
Take a taxi or hire a private limousine/transportation form if you have a lot of money as these two airports are a longer distance away from each other.

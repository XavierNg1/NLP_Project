Prepare your truck to make it easier to secure your cargo.
Use cargo netting for hauling light materials like insulation or lawn trash.
Buy a tarp sized for your load.

Secure cargo to a pallet when it is loaded.
Be aware that it is difficult to secure cargo in a truck bed in a fashion that will ensure its safety from a determined thief who has opportunity to access the truck unnoticed.
Invest in quality ratchet straps for tying down heavy cargo.


Tie your cargo down from at least two sides, securing ropes or straps to the load itself where possible, or crossing over the top in an X manner to prevent movement in all directions.

Travel the smoothest, straightest path available.
Be aware of the load capacity of your truck.

Tie a flag on unusually long loads, so other drivers will notice it overhanging the tailgate and avoid approaching too closely.Keep very heavy loads as far forward as possible to prevent the front of the vehicle from becoming light and making steering less effective and more difficult.
Consider placing valuable tools and other items behind the seats in the cab.

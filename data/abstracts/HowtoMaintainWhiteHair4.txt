Put on suitable clothes or use an apron.
Work in a ventilated room.
Mix your bleach powder and peroxide in a NON-METALLIC bowl, with a non-metallic tool such as a tint brush or a plastic spoon or spatula


Mix the bleach until it is smooth and creamy, do not apply if there are chunks of powder in the bowl, it has to be smooth for even coverage and results, if it's lumpy your hair will be patchy and uneven.
Start in the back.
Stay at least one inch away from the roots.
Apply the bleach to all of the quadrants in this manner.
Do not wrap your hair on top of your hair or put it in a bun, let it lay loosely down as it is so that it can oxidise.

Buy whole salmon fillets when preparing baked salmon.
Leave the skin on the fillet and bake skin-side down.
Set the oven temperature between 325 ºF/175ºC and 375ºF/190ºC.
Cook the salmon fillet in a covered, oven-proof baking dish.
Check the fish often, as cooking times vary, widely depending on the equipment used and the size of the fillet.
Use a meat thermometer if available.

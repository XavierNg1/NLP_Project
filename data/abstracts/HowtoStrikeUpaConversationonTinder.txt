Be friendly, not creepy.
Don’t just say “Hi.” Remember, the idea behind Tinder is to match with as many attractive people as possible, and to find someone in that pile that you can get along with.
Pay attention to their profile.
Ask a question.
That being said, avoid yes-or-no questions.
Leave the compliments until later in the conversation, particularly if you are a man talking to a woman.
Don’t keep talking about yourself!,
If you have mutual friends or interests, mention them!,
Pay attention to their language.

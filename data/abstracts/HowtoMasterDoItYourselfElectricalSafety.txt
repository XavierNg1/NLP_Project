Electrical safety is without question, the most important aspect of any electrical work.
It really just takes a common sense approach, but just as important; it demands your undivided attention.
All it takes is one mistake – and some think that 120 volts is not dangerous.
Keep a flashlight near your electrical panel at all times, just in case of a power loss.

,
Use fiberglass ladders for any electrical work that you do.
Never work on electrical systems in the rain, or in damp or wet locations, or where power is not completely shut off.

The best type of shoes are rubber-soled shoes, and when possible stand on a rubber mat, or dry wooden floors or sub-floors.
Anything can conduct electricity if the conditions are right.
When you turn off the power to a breaker, tape that breaker off.
In your home, at minimum put tape over the breaker, red tape if you have it, then close your service panel cover, and put a piece of masking tape across the cover, or a sign that says, “Do Not Open,�?,
Furthermore, inform your family members that you are doing electrical work so that, if you’ve got teenagers or kids that are capable of turning breakers back on, they are completely aware that you are working on the electrical system.

,
If you are working with fuse panels instead of breaker panels; when you remove a fuse, use only one hand to remove it.
Now, electricity can still flow through one hand and one foot and pass through your heart, but if you’ve taken the other precautions I mentioned above, you will minimize your exposure to that hazard.

Another important aspect of safety that frequently goes unmentioned is tool use.

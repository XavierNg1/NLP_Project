You need to be of a good standard.
Get enrolled in a stage school.
Have an agent.
Don't lie about work because they ask for people who can confirm and they will pick out a scam.
When you get an audition, do try your best.
Remember that not all parts are the leading role.
If you get to the West End, feel free to be nervous.
And finally, enjoy it!

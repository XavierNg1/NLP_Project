Buy a gel based paint stripper such as CitriStrip.
Grab gloves specific for paint stripping.
Begin the process by a ritual of cleaning it up with tsp solution.
So put on the gloves, lay down some plastic sheeting (make sure it's not plastic bag thin), we want to ensure quality effort is being put forth, place your project upon and start by adding some of the gel solution into a metal cup/ bowl.
After you've taken your social break get back to work by using the scraper to remove the bubbled paint.
Now, clean up the piece by washing it rinsing it through with mineral spirits, the no odor kind, and use the appropriate steel wool to do this.

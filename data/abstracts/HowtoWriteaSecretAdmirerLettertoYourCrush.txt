Start off by writing a simple note.
Find out where her locker is and slip it in there, or be creative and slip in one of her books.
Leave subtle hints that it's you, don't leave her hanging.
Try leaving the notes in places that you are in.
Try to see her reaction.
If you see she is trying really hard to find out her secret admirer, leave her a note saying "meet me here(then time and place)"Don't come out and say your name.

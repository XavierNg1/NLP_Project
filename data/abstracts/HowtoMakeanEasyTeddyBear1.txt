Think of a design for your toy.
Get some two pieces of fairly big pieces of felt.
Get a fabric marker and draw eyes, a nose, a mouth.
Sew some buttons on for eyes and nose or you could even cut out felt things to sew or glue on.

,
Get a needle and thread and sew the side of the teddy together.
Stuff your teddy!,
Put the stuffing in and then sew up the gap.

,
Give your teddy a name.
Give your teddy lots of love.
Finished.

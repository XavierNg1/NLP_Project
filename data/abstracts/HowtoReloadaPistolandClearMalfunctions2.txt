Determine if it is safe to perform a tactical reload.
Reach to your magazine pouch (or other magazine holder and a pocket maybe; make sure you have a full magazine).

,
Move back to the gun and eject the partially depleted magazine into your hand.

,
Put the magazine in your pocket (separate from fresh magazines).

,
Grab the fresh magazine you touched earlier and insert it into the gun in the same fashion as the emergency reload, but this reload doesn't require manipulation of the slide.

,
Practice at the range.

Understand that problems with high potassium are generally the result of kidney disease or medication use.There are other causes, but these two are the most common by far.
Get an electrocardiogram.Because high potassium can be so dangerous to the heart (and because heart symptoms are one of the major ways to diagnose it), your doctor will want to get you an electrocardiogram (a test that evaluates your heart's rate and rhythm pattern) as quickly as possible if your levels are significantly elevated.
Review your list of current medications with your doctor.
Have an IV inserted.Assuming your potassium is high enough to warrant more aggressive medical treatment, your doctor will ask the nurse to insert an IV line as this can help to deliver the appropriate treatments more effectively and efficiently.
Ask about diuretics.
Have hemodialysis.
Continue to be monitored by doctors post-treatment.
Modify your diet.
Watch for cardiac symptoms.
Pay attention to nausea and vomiting.
Look for fatigue and weakness.Potassium helps muscles function, so if you have too much or too little, your muscles can weaken, making you feel weak, tired, and lethargic.
Be aware of any numbness or tingling sensations.Feelings of numbness or tingling are also related to muscle activity.
Understand that you may have no symptoms at all.

Don't dress like a rich person if you can.
Don't carry expensive items with you (such as a camera, laptop computer, etc).

,
Know where you're heading or pretend you do.
Don't talk to anyone unless you are fluent in their language.
If you do get mugged, and the mugger wants something from you, like your shoes or your cash, don't argue, just give it to them.
Don't panic if you see a gun or a knife.
If you get the chance to go away, just walk.
Don't try to hide things unless you are a good liar, and are absolutely sure the thieves don't know you have it.

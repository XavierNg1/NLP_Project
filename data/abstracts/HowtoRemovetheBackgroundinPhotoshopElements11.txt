Prepare before the shot.
Start Adobe Photoshop Elements 11.
Use "File > Open" and select the photo you want to edit.

,
In the top menu, select "View > Actual Pixels" or "View > Fit on Screen".

,
Click the pink Eraser Icon in the left menu.
In the bottom menu, select Size to 25 pixels and Tolerance to 15%.
Move the cursor, which is now a circle with a center Plus Sign, to the photo background, and click.
Experiment changing Tolerance sliding bar to 10% or to 30%.
Once your photo is close to the way you want it, enlarge it with the View menu zoom items to closely examine the borders of the image that remains.
If there are more background areas to erase, then at this point you have two options: continue using the same Background Eraser Tool, or switch to the basic Eraser Tool that simply erases everything it touches.
To use the basic Eraser, click the Eraser Icon next to the eraser and scissors icon and press "CTRL-A" to select the whole image.
Save your hard work in a different file using the top menu "File > Save As".
Close Photoshop, or use CTRL-D to de-select the photo so you can continue doing other edits on it.

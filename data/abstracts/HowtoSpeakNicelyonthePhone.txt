Say "Hello?",
Try to avoid putting someone on hold.
If the person they are trying to call is not available, say so.
When making a call, state your name if you are looking for someone other than the person who picked up.
Introduce yourself with, "Hello, my name is Jane and I got this number from John, I am calling about ..." if the person who picks up doesn't know you.

Always end with, "Thank you - Goodbye."

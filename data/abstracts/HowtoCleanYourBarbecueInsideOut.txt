Wash at the end of a cookout when the barbecue is still warm, and the grime has not had time to cake on yet.
Use special scrubbing stones or even scrapers which you can buy to break off tough, brittle dirt.
If you have managed to steam-soften the inside of the barbecue itself then things ought to be easier.
Start by getting rid of any kind of lava rocks or ceramic coals and put all of them into a bucket of warm soapy water.
Clean the outside.
If you want to minimize work later on, try spraying the actual barbecue grill with oil before you cook to really make it more non-stick.
Finished.

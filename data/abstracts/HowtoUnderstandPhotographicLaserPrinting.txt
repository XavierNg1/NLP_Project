Color saturation: Basically, the color calibration of a laser printer is based on common paper (80-100 gsm) before delivery.
Printing speed: Slower printing speed can allow more time for toner transfer, avoiding paper jams and increasing color saturation.
Paper polarity: Thanks to the toner, almost all laser printers have negative polarity.
Moisture: Moisture tends to make pulp fibers expand, raising paper thickness and accentuating uneven roughness.
Thermal stress: Many people recommend inkjet glossy photo paper or premium paper for laser photographic printing.
Resolution: Due to the fact that toner is a dry powder in its natural state, the paper has no connection with resolution.

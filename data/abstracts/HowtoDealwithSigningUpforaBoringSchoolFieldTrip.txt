If you have time, and it's desperate, ask if you can revoke your request to go on the trip.
Accept that you are going if you can't revoke your request.
Pack your supplies.
Try to stay close to friends during the trip.
Listen attentively to your instructions once you arrive.
If you're allowed to purchase gifts from a gift shop, be sensible.
Have fun on the trip!

Know that your baby's hair should not be washed every day.
Purchase a shampoo which is not too hard on the skin as babies are much more sensitive than adults.
Be sure to wash your baby's body before beginning their hair.
Take your baby out of the tub and wrap him/her in a warm, dry towel.
Position yourself so that you can safely hold your baby over the tub or sink.
Hold your baby so that only his or her head is over the tub.
Use either a cup or your palm to gently pour lukewarm water over your baby's hair.
Take a small amount of shampoo into your palm.
Gently lather up your baby's head with the shampoo.
Wash the shampoo out of your baby's hair using the same method as in step 6.
Grab your washcloth to dry your baby's hair.

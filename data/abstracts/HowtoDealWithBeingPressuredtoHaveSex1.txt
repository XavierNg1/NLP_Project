Be firm and direct.The best way to deal with being pressured to have sex is to tell the person to stop in a clear, direct way, whether its a stranger or someone you know.Doing this makes it plain that you don’t want to have sex and want them to quit pressuring you right now.
Say ‘no’ with your body language.
Leave the situation.

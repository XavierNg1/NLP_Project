Start with clean, damp, tangle-free hair.
Pull your hair up into a bun at the top of your head, leaving the bottom layer undone.
Consider adding some light-hold styling mousse for extra holding powder.This is especially helpful for those with very straight hair, or whose hair can't hold a curl.
Take a 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide section of hair from the bottom layer.
Bend a straw in half.
Begin wrapping the hair around the straw in figure-eights.
Tie a mini hair elastic around the ends of the straw when you reach the end of your hair.
Repeat the process for the rest of the hair in the bottom layer.
Keep winding your hair around straws in one inch sections until you reach the top of your head.
Consider giving your hair a light mist of hairspray.This will help your hair hold its crimped shape better when you take the straws out.

,
Let the hair dry.
Remove the straws the next day.
Style your hair, if desired, but avoid brushing it.
Finished.

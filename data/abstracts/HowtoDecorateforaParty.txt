Decide who the party is for.
Decide what the occasion is.
Chose a theme.
Use the upcoming holiday or current season as inspiration if you are having troubles coming up with a theme.
Know your budget.
Keep the location in mind.
Judge how much time you will need to set up the party, and how much help you will have.
Consider how much you are willing to clean up afterwards.
Know that decorations don't have to be balloons, paper cutouts, banners, and streamers.
Attach paper cutouts to walls and windows if you are short on space.
Cover tables with tablecloths, table runners, and vases.
Hang banners and pennants in doorways or windows.
Don't forget the balloons.
Don't forget the small things, such as plates, cups, and napkins.

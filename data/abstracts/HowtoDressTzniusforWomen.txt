Sleeves should be all the way to the wrists.
this is the strictest version the bare laws of Tznius are: 1.you must cover the collar bone 2. you must cover your elbows 3.you must cover the knees 4. some strict people will always cover thier legs, even with sheer stockings, while others are more lenient.many people may not follow these rules and still consider themselves Tznius but this is incorrect you cannot adjust Tznius to your standards, this is the minimum you can do while still being tznius,
Most likely, you will be wearing skirts.
If you are married, you may be covering your hair.

Select an image of a face from either a magazine, clip art or a copy of a photo.Cut off the flat bottom of a paper lunch bag and cut out the seam that runs down the back,Spread the piece of paper out flat and fold in half vertically.
Glue the face to the front of the sack (the top layer).Draw hair or a hat or the above mentioned headdress, crown or whatever above the face .
Give the face a neck and a body of sorts.Go over the pencil lines with a permanent black pen.
Decorate your doll by drawing straight or squiggly lines; add geometric shapes and any desired decoration.Color with pencils.Place a few short lengths of double-stick tape inside the doll to hold it together; then cut out around it, leaving at least a 1-inch border all the way around.
Making sure that the paper is still taped to hold the bag together, stitch around the doll--preferably on a sewing machine.
Cut away the excess paper, cutting about 1⁄8 or 1⁄4 inch (0.3 or 0.6 cm) outside the stitched lines.
In an electric skillet, melt the beeswax to 200 F degrees.If there are any white spots where there is a build-up of the wax, use a heat gun to melt off the surplus.
Once you have made one of these dolls, you will see how really easy they are to make and what fun they can be.

While taxiing, apply full back pressure on the yoke (pull it towards you) to relieve the pressure on the nose wheel.
If you can, don't stop at the hold short line (only if you have permission to do so and traffic conditions allow for it).
Once you have obtained clearance (only at towered airports), taxi onto the runway and align on the center-line.

,
Do not stop.
The nose will begin to rise.
The plane will takeoff on its own.
As the speed increases, you will need to apply even more forward pressure on the yoke.
Once you reach a safe airspeed (usually the best rate of climb also known as Vy), raise the nose and climb, maintaining Vy.
Enter the pattern as you would at any airport after contacting the tower or announcing your position on the CTAF.

,
Fly the standard traffic pattern, beginning your descent on the downwind leg abeam the touchdown point of the runway.
When the runway is 45째 over your shoulder, turn base and lower another 10째 of flaps.

,
Turn final to align the plane with the runway and lower flaps completely (30째 or 40째 depending on the aircraft).
Once you are a couple feet above the runway, gently flare and add a little bit of power.
As soon as the main gear touches the runway, pull the power back to idle.

,
Apply full back pressure on the yoke to keep the nose wheel off the ground.
Holding full back pressure, taxi off the runway to make room for other traffic.

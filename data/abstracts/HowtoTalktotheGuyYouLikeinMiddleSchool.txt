Before starting a conversation with him, smile when he looks at you whenever you happen to lock eyes.
If he doesn't start a conversation with you after smiling, YOU start the talking.
Just greet him and introduce yourself, but remember to be enthusiastic and very friendly towards him.

,
Ask about classes you both share or your opinion on teachers when confronting him.
Remember to smile!,
Just be yourself!,
Act as if he is just one of your regular friends that you know.

,
Don't put on tons of make-up to try to impress him.
Look presentable!,
Don't talk about other guys when talking.
Have fun!,
If you find out he's not interested in you, don't sweat it.

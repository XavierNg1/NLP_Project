Pack your food, clothing, and weapons!,
Go to Jamaa Township!

,
Go in the Pillow Room!

,
Set up your tent!,
Put your bags down in the tent!,
Build a fire by using wood and sticks!,
Roast marshmallows and make s'mores!,
Sing campfire songs!,
Then, when it's time for bed, crawl into the tent, then close it, and sleep!,
Time to wake up!

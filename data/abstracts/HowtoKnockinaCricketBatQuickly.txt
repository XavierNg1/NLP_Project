Oiling.
The first step we do is to obtain the oldest, daggiest leather ball we have and then start to softly hit the front face (blade) with the ball in one hand and the bat on our laps.
Some people recommend doing this with a Wooden or Ball Bat Mallet straight from the start and you can do this immediately but put an old sock over the Mallet to soften the initial knocking in process.

,
During this process make sure that you are knocking every region of the blade.
Every once in a while press a fingernail lightly into the blade.
After these first 2 hours with an old leather ball or the sock covered mallet have a break.
The next day or after your break use a wooden Bat Mallet without its sock to begin gently tapping the face and edges of the blade.
Running in.
At this stage begin to get the feel of the cricket bat.
Get a mate to throw or bowl you some old leather balls in the nets.
That should now be 6 hours spent knocking in your cricket bat.

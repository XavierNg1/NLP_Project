Locate catnip plants growing wild either on your property, or visit a garden store during the spring or summer, and purchase a catnip plant or two.
Cut the plant at the base with scissors so you have long stalks of catnip.
Secure the catnip together with either yarn or heavy thread.

,
Dry the catnip by hanging it upside down in a dry, dark area such as a linen closet.
Wait four to eight weeks (or more depending on the humidity and light conditions) you will have completely dry catnip!

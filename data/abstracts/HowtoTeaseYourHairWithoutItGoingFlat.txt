Wash your hair.
Teasing will be much easier, especially if you have long, silky locks, if you get the roots, or where ever you will be teasing, "fake dry".
Separate hair.
Straighten your hair.
Before teasing hair spray the underneath so that you get a bigger lift.

,
Tease your hair.
Make your hair look even.
Before and after teasing remember to hair spray!!,
Give your hair a light spray, about 6 inches (15.2Â cm) from your head completely covering the top and bottom.
If you want the allusion that your hair is dry on top, add more putty.
Finished.

Obtain the consent of the person you intend to tie up.
At no time should the hogtied person be left alone unsupervised.
Tie the person's hands behind their back.
Optionally tie the person's elbows together gently.
Have the person lie down flat on the ground.
Tie the person's feet together at the ankles.
On a barefooted person it can also be monitored way more reliably that the blood circulation or nerve pathways will not be cut off by the rope.
Optionally, tie their legs together, just under the knee.
Use another rope to tie the bare ankles to the wrists behind the back.

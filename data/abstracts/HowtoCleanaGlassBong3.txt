Fill the bong with the roughly one cup of rubbing alcohol.
Add 2-3 tablespoons of large-grain salt.
Seal up the openings to the bong with your hands.
Shake the bong to "scrub" it with the salt.
Soak the bong in the alcohol or cleaning products if you have difficult or hard to scrub stains.
Give the bong a nice shine with some water and lemon juice.

Open your word processing program.
Select any image you would like as a notebook cover.
Select "File" and press "Export".

Print out the image through a printer, if you have one.
Make sure your image fits over whatever folder/binder/notebook you're using.
Take your double-stick tape and place it around the corners, and some of the edges.
Brush or spread your glue all over the center of the paper.
Carefully place your paper on the notebook.
Voilà !

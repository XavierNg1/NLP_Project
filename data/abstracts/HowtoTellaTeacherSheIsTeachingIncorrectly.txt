Prepare.
Choose the right moment.
No matter how you may feel, don't have an attitude.
Never turn the process into an argument.
If you have a problem with the way a professor teaches do not tell them it's bad and they need to change it.
If you are in fact wrong and they have defeated all of your evidence, accept defeat.
If the teacher does admit you are right, do not rub it in.

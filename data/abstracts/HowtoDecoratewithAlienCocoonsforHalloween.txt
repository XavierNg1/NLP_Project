Create a backdrop for your lair, unless your walls look creepy enough to show through.
Cut and hang the backdrop.
Add torn strips of cheesecloth sprayed with fluorescent paint on top of the black paper and cloth.
Conceal fog machines in the corners of the room.
Fix a few large strobe lights to the ceiling to give the room an otherworldly shock effect.

,
Create the cocoons.
Paint the cocoons.
Hang the cocoons in clusters from the ceiling.
Touch up the cocoons again with paint, unless you didn't install a backdrop earlier.
Add a final layer of web.
Add large latex rubber veins, and water balloons coated with Vaseline and thick hair gel.

,
Add a thick coating of clear hair gel to all the hanging sacks, veins, and dangling globules in the room.
Apply a generous amount of a realistic stage blood by dipping a large paint brush into a can of blood and whipping it around the room.
Clean up the scraps, check the display from a distance, make sure that the foggers and the strobe lights are functioning properly,and add on anything else you have lying around that might fit.

,
Some suggestions: Severed arms, legs, intestines, rotten heads made of rubber with the eyes pulled out, also coated in a non toxic food like applesauce, dyed blue cottage cheese, or tomato paste.
Rubber eyeballs affixed to the sacks, human ears, animal bones strewn about the floor, and plastic skulls covered in brown paint to simulated decay -these types of details will add to the shock effect producing fun and thrills for all involved.

,
Hide in the closet with a bloody flannel shirt, and a latex pig mask covered in blood.
Make sure you have a loud CD playing on infinite repeat.
Have a fun and safe time!

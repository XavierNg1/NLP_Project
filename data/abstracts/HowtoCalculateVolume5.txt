Learn the properties of a cone.
Know the formula for calculating the volume of a cone.
Calculate the area of the circular base of the cone.
Find the height of the cone.
Multiply the height of the cone by the area of the base.
Now multiply the result by 1/3 (or simply divide by 3) to find the volume of the cone.
Remember to express your answer in cubic units.

Allow your petunias to start blooming.
Get a sharp pair of pruning shears or scissors.
Pick up a petunia stem gently.
Cut up to 1/2 of the petunia stem with your sharp shears.
Prune 1 stem weekly on a small petunia plant, or prune 8 to 12 stems in a large hanging basket.
Time a large pruning session for mid-summer, if you were not able to do it weekly.
Fertilize petunias with a liquid fertilizer every 2 weeks.

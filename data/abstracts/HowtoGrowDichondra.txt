Understand that Dichondra is a type of morning glory, and it is often considered a weed.
Choose an ornamental Dichondra called “Silver Falls” or “Silver Dichondra” if you want a cascading groundcover.
Ask your local landscape company or garden center whether it is good for lawns in your area.
Decide if you will start the Dichondra from seed or purchase bedding plants.
Wait until late spring or early summer to start your Dichondra grass.
Consider laying down a weed killer, like Roundup, across the entire lawn if you have a lot of competing plants or weeds.
Roto-till your lawn to a depth of six inches (15cm).
Rake the surface free of any rocks or sticks.
Broadcast the seeds at a rate of 1 lb.
Rake the soil.
Sprinkle the seedbed with water three to five times a day.
Wait about two weeks for the Dichondra lawn to sprout.
Fertilize the lawn with a nitrogen-rich compost or product every winter.
Mow every two weeks.
Choose an area that has full sun or partial shade.
Plant the seed when temperatures are in the 70s or start them inside ahead of time.
Ensure your soil is well drained.
Plant the bedding plants to soil level.
Water to a depth of one to two inches (2.5 to 5cm) the first time.
Apply nitrogen-rich fertilizer.
Don’t water too frequently.

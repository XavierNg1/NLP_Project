Mix the dry ingredients together but leave out the tea leaves for now.
Pour the oil into the mixture and stir until it makes the entire mixture moist.
Add the boiling water to the green tea leaves to revive them and have them stretch to full size (this helps the end look).
Create the bath bomb shape.
Place each bath bomb onto a sheet of parchment (baking paper) or wax paper on a flat surface.
Use or gift.

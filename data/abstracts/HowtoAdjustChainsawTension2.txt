Use a flat file, check if the bar has uneven "high spots" that you can file down.
Figure out which way the chain needs to face so the blades pull forward.
Lock the chain into the grooves on the bar.
Remove the cover over the blade area and attach the bar.
Reattach the covering so that the bar is snugly and firmly in place.
Hold the nose of the bar up slightly as you work.
Find your adjusting screw and tighten it until the blade is snug on the bar.
With hands still gloved, manually pull the chain around the bar to check for tight spots.

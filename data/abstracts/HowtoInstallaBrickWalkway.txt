Make some walkway sketches to get an idea of the design you like before doing anything else.
Use a garden hose to lay out a rough design for your brick walkway.
Mark your walkway with stakes so you can work on the area without accidentally moving the original lines.
Cut through the grass and dirt with a garden spade to create perfectly straight, vertical lines.
Remove the grass and dirt from the inside of your walkway with a rounded shovel.
Level the ground appropriately for your walkway.
Layer 4 inches (10.1 cm) of gravel inside the walkway bed and tamp it down.
Put plastic forms inside the walkway to define the edges.
Stand bricks or pavers on end, edge to edge, if you plan to border your walkway.

Fill your brick walkway bed with approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm) of stone dust.

Sweep the stone dust into all the cracks and in between each brick.
Hose some water over the brick walkway to seal or secure the bricks in the stone dust.

Determine what your budget is.
Determine if you are going to collect old pens or modern pens.
Pen stores are good for modern pens, but there are few over the counter stores selling vintage pens.
If you are looking for pens for their writing qualities, buying used models from nonspecialists on eBay may not be the best bet.
Be aware that not all limited editions have a strong secondary market, especially those offered by newer, less prominent pen makers.

Many parts of the vintage pen market have been soft for the past several years due to the retirement of first generation collectors and the preoccupation of Internet-era new collectors with vintage pens as users.

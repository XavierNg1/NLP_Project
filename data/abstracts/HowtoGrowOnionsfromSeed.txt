Choose the right type of seed for your growing zone.
Plan on starting the onion seeds indoors, 8 to 10 weeks before the last frost date.
Fill a shallow container with a dampened seed starting mix.
Plant the seeds according to the label on your seed packet.
Keep the seeds warm and damp until they sprout.
Limit the humidity and warmth once the seedlings sprout.
Harden the seedlings for 4 weeks before you transplant them outside.
Wait until the seedlings are at least 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) tall.This will ensure that the young plants are strong enough to tolerate the outdoor environment.

,
Prepare some well-draining, phosphorous-rich soil in a spot that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight.
Plant the seedlings at least 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) apart.
Water the seedlings.
Water the onions frequently, and never let them dry out.
Pull the soil away from the bulbs to expose the tops as they mature.
Harvest the bulbs.
Trim the leaves down to 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters).If you plan on braiding the onions into a rope, like garlic, you can leave the leaves longer.

,
Pull the bulbs out of the ground.
Cure the onions out of direct sunlight, someplace that is warm, dry, and has good air circulation.
Store the cured onions someplace dry and cool with good air circulation.

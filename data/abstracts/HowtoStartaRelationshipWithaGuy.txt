Become friends.
Make sure they like you.
Look nice, guys want you to be easy to look at, and they also hate it when girls look like they're trying to hard, so wear clothes that show your personality, because that's the most beautiful thing to most guys.
I know most of you girls like it when the guys does all the talking, but guys will love to actually have a real conversation not just.. something like this: Guy:Hey, how's it going-I just realized my favorite color is actually orange!,
guys will hate it, they'd want you to say: Oh well Blue is nice but, I guess you're right there really is just something about Orange that is nice, i agree with you!,
Once you are completely sure of them liking you, flirt your brains out, flirt like there's no tomorrow!!!,
Once you guys are finally dating; instead of planning a hangout time or anything like that, sneak up on them and just say a simple greeting.

Firstly, wash hair.
Gently towel dry your hair.
Dry hair and detangle.
Leave your hair to air dry until your hair is roughly 70% dry.
When you are sure your hair is dry, comb through hair and use clips to section your hair into four sections, from ear to ear and from the nape of your neck to the top of your head (and so you have a cross on the back of your head).

,
Go to a place that has either been covered, somewhere where a rogue spray won't annoy anyone, or, outside.
Take one of the bottom sections first.
Continue with your other bottom section of your hair on the other side of your head.

,
Un-clip your top layer of hair.
Finish all your hair.

,
Try not to touch your hair until you are confident it is dry!,
Make sure you're not the odd one out at school, dip dye with a friend!

Cut a piece of thread about 20" (50.8cm) long.
Push the needle down through all three layers of the quilt fabric and then up again about 1/4" (6.35mm) away from the initial down stitch.
Take the needle back to where it first went in and repeat the stitch.
Cut the thread about 2" (5cm) away from the stitch.

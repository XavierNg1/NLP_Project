Select an oil scent that is pleasing and not overpowering.
Consider choosing more than one oil scent.
Change oil seasonally.
Add one or two drops of the chosen essential oil to the inside/cardboard area of a new toilet paper roll.
Allow the oil to dry before placing the roll in the dispenser.
Test drive the air freshener and remove a few squares of toilet paper.
Refresh the toilet paper roll with a few additional drops of oil if you no longer detect the oil when using the bathroom.

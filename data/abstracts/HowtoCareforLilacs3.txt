Pay attention to your mature lilac bushes.
Wait until later spring, after the lilacs bloom, to prune them.
Prune dead wood first.
Cut back the tallest canes to eye height next.
Finish your yearly pruning with the weakest branches.
Start a different pruning plan if your lilac bushes are overgrown.
Consider chopping your entire lilac bush down to six to eight inches high if you donâ€™t mind it not flowering for a few years.
Encourage blooming by cutting spent blooms each year.

Think carefully about your reasons for contemplating any position that is less than what your qualifications could get you.
Realize that the interviewer is most likely asking this question because he or she has already reached a conclusion that you're overqualified.
Address the question with good reasons.
Feel free to question the interviewer's assumption if you don't believe it's true.

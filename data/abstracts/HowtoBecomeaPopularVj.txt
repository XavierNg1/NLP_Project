- Start a clip library.
- Find your niche.
-Make business cards.
- Get a VJ program.
- This should be obvious, but you need to have equipment.
- No matter how many clips you have, you will always, always need more.
ALWAYS do an equipment check before you leave your house.
Wherever you are going to be V.J.-ing at a club, show up before the patrons so that you can hook it all up, position the projector if necessary (a lot of clubs have their own) and make sure everything works.
Don't rely on the same graphics that other V.J.
A good way to ingratiate yourself to any club you work for is to make a few clips with their logos in them, or at least the name of the club.
If you just bring some movies to screen from your hard drive, that is NOT VJing.

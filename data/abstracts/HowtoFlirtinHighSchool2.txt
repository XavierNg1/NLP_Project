Tease them a little bit.
Give them a compliment.Giving sincere, meaningful compliments can be hard, but try to get beyond something like, “I like your shirt” or “Cool sunglasses!” Instead, you should say something you like about the person that sparks a conversation between the two of you.
Ask them an “unnecessary” question.
Practice “reciprocal disclosure.” You and the person you’re flirting with should try to disclose about the same amount of personal information.
Keep it positive.

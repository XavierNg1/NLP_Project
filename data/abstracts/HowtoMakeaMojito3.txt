Put the mint leaves, 2 teaspoons sugar, lime juice, and 1 oz.
Press the round end of a muddler into the glass and twist gently.
Pour in 2 jiggers (3 oz or 88 ml) of coconut flavored rum.The cream of coconut will already give the drink a nice, refreshing taste of coconut, so if you want to keep it subtle, you can use an unflavored white (or light or silver) rum instead.
Fill the glass 3/4 of the way with ice and top with club soda.

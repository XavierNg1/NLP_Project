Remember that whilst your marriage may not have traveled down the path that you wanted, or expected, that you are not to blame yourself, and a marriage is rarely ever of one sided blame.
Remember that you are not alone.
Remember who you are.
Last but not least, do not forget that you are worthy of love and WILL find love again.
DO not use your failed marriage as a guideline of comparison to other things in your life, no matter how tempting it may be, this is not and will not be the beginning of a string of failed attempts and sabotaged opportunities.

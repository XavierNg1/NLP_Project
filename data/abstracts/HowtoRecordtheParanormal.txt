Know your facts.
Always try to recreate your experiences, for example if you hear a scary noise try to make that noise again.
Try to get information about your situation.
Know the different tools you have to work with.
Remember that if you have a ghost in your home that they were people once and technically still are.
Know that there are not just ghosts, you can have a poltergeist, ghost, spirit, imprint, haunting, negative entity, and a number of other things.
After you have pinpointed which one you have and followed the other steps just think back to the things that happened inexplicably.
Don't bother going to a physic.
Start your investigation at the time when you have noticed activity to be at a high, the middle of the night isn't always the best time.
Remember that the entities are there for a reason, some are there because they are family and are helping you, others because they used to own the house, maybe they are tied to the land and mad that now there's a building on it, maybe you drew the spirit in.

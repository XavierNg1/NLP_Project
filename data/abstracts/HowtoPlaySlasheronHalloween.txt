There are 2 teams: Slashers and Campers.
Tell everyone that they can talk to each other (everyone can hear it) and they can text message each other.
Have everyone go to their "cabins" (rooms or closets, pantries, under a desk, in a big enough cabinet, living room, etc.),
While the person giving out the pieces of papers is delivering the roles, have them have post-it notes in their pocket to give to the slashers, whether when it's the first NIGHT round or before the game even has begun.
Each post-it note must have a round number on it written in permanent pen.
The first round is "night.",
The slashers stay in THEIR cabins too, but they can have other slashers meet up with them.
Every night slashers must agree on ONE PERSON (ALL must agree) to kill.
The next round is day, but still is Round 1.
Who ever is killed or voted off has to draw an X on their hand and cannot interact with anyone, cannot leave hints, cannot do ANYTHING.
Play as many rounds until the game ends, which is when either ALL the slashers are killed/voted off or all but 1 campers are killed/voted off.

See the tips below for the "Buyer Beware".
Set the scale on a level firm surface - thin or low pile carpet and stiff linoleum is OK, as is concrete, non slip tiles (see warnings) and hardwood surfaces.
Turn the scale on and when it comes to zero, step on.
Record your weight in your diary or on an Excel spreadsheet where you can graph your data.
Keep your scale checked once every two years, however it is recommended to check them annually.

Prepare for your reborn as you would a real baby.
Unbox the baby!,
Care for the baby.
If you really want to take it seriously and have the time for it, create a schedule for your baby.
Be comfortable showing your baby off to friends and family if you enjoy doing so.
Take your baby on a walk through the neighborhood in a stroller with a pacifier in their mouth and all snuggled up in the stroller.

Realize that you have done something wrong to make the person fall out with you.
Talk to the person and tell them that you understand what you have done wrong to them, you are really sorry for doing it and you really want to be friends again.
Give them some time to mull over your apology and come to terms with what you have said.
Give your friend a 'Sorry' card or a gift, such as chocolate.
Understand that if they agree to give you a chance, be a really great friend to them.

Purchase a wood lathe.
Set up the lathe in a space with good lighting in an area that makes for easy cleanup for the wood chips and dust.

,
Sketch out the shape you want to achieve on a sheet of paper, keeping the design within the limits of the wood blank and capacity of the lathe.

,
Begin turning by finding the center of the wood stock on each end.
Slide the tailstock center spur up to the center of the other end of the wood, locking it down.

,
Turn the handle on the tailstock center, driving the wood blank into the spurn of the headstock securing it between the centers.

,
Set the tool rest to an approximate center of the work piece and as close as possible without it hitting the work piece when it is turning.

,
Start the lathe on slow speed and use a gouge to rough out or round off the piece to the basic shape you need.

,
Position the large gouge, tip turned up, onto the tool rest with the end of the handle against your hip.
Use the parting tool with a pair of outside calipers to set the depth of cuts you will need.
Set the skewed chisel at an angle onto the tool rest.
Sand the piece while it is still mounted and turning at a slow speed.
Cut the end of the work that is attached to the headstock and tailstock loose with the parting tool.

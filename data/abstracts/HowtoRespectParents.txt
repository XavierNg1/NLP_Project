Be aware of, and appreciate all the things that your parents do for you from day to day, month to month, year to year.
Recognize and respect the fact that they have been through many more life experience than you, and can offer you a great deal of knowledge about the world you live in.
It's a given that sometimes your parents may seem totally clueless and you may feel like they can't possibly relate to the things your dealing with currently, But believe what I say, they actually do understand some of the things that your going through like peer pressure, friendship issues, and a lot of other things that kids your age has to deal with simply because they were once a kid just like you.
Remember that your parents love you more than anything else in the world, an have high expectations of what they want you to achieve because they believe in you and want to see you be at your best as you become an adult.
When at times you feel that your parents don’t listen or don’t take you seriously, take a moment to think about what you want them to know and discuss your problems calmly with them and make sure you listen to their side of the story.
Make a daily effort not to complain about having to obey your parents commands.
Be helpful and assume responsibility around the house by doing extra chores when you can, just to show that you want to do your part in your everyday family life.
Remember that new clothes, toys, cell phones, and money allowances are always nice, but be aware of your parents' income and how much they can afford to spend on the things that they buy for your enjoyment.
Remember that one of the most important things you can do for your parents is to be a loving person.
And last but not least...Everyday, take the opportunity to tell your parents you love them.

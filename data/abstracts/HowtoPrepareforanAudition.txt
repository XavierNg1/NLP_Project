Find out all you can about the audition.
Don't be shy.
Check, check and double check what will be expected of you.
Practice, practice, practice!,
The night before the audition, gather any materials you may be required to bring with you.
On the day, eat a balanced breakfast.
Arrive reasonably early to your audition, as there will inevitably be a moderately large amount of people there before you.
Don't chicken out.
When you're finished...


Be patient.
Remember: Break a leg!

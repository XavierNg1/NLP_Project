Always Be Polite.
If you are invited to a family event or anything where there will be many adults around, show good manners by asking or offering assistance to people for example: Washing dishes, clearing the table, cleaning up messes in general.

,
When an adult asks you a question answer it honestly, or maybe tell a non-threatening story.
Try to make an individual connection with them.
Feel comfortable... but not too comfortable.
Do not work on one specific person.
Be generous.

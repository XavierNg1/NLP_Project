Use functional and fun lighting outside.
Consider the types of lighting available.
Use decorative fixtures are used along pathways, on walls and posts, and entrance foyers.
Be mindful, however, that most lantern-style fixtures are glaring light sources.
Use hidden lights for functional purposes.
Include some lighting for security, too.

"Jigsaw" an assignment.
Make a "scavenger hunt", so to speak.
"Read, pair and share.",
"Check and compare.",
"Interview, rotate and discuss.",
"Make multiple representations.",
"Play motivational Nerf basketball.",
"Play Friday-shots quiz game.",
Make it so that the points enable each student to "buy" something (such as a piece of candy, an item of stationery, or other things you know your students would appreciate).
Consider class offices, for each team.

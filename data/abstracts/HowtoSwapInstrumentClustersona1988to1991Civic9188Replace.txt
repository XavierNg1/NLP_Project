Unscrew the gauge cluster housing; the top 2 screws are behind pop off panels on the top of the housing.
Make sure you remove the 2-3 wire harnesses in back for the hazard switch, defroster, and any other harnesses back there.
Remove 4 more screws (2 on each side), then reach behind and unplug 3 plugs and unplug the speedometer cable (it unclips just like the plugs do) Then you're ready to pull the cluster out.
The clear plastic cover and black surround pop off as one piece.Pull the screws behind the speedo (2 of them have the wires from the grey box on them ) Then the speedo comes out.
Carefully, pry the speedo needle off, it pulls straight off, but it's really tight and really fragile.
The trip odometer reset buttons are in a slightly different place on the 2 speedos, so you have to swap the buttons as well.
Going back together is as easy as reversing the process.
On top of the cluster is this little piece that holds 2 light bulbs, it casts an amber glow on to the gauges.
Put everything back together reverse of taking it off.
Enjoy your new tachometer.

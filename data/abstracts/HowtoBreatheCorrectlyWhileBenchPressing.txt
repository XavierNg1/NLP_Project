Put the weight on the bar.
To press the maximum weight, expand your chest to the maximum.
While you are pumping up your chest, also think about technique and psyche yourself for the heavy lift.
Unpack the weight off the rack and bring it towards your chest when you do this inhale as you lower the weight towards you.
Exhale strongly with your throat constricted to maintain the air in your lungs as you push the weight away from you.
Keep a lot of your breath to lift the bar beyond the initial explosion off the chest, pulling the weight up with your traps, to lockout, and to rack the bar.

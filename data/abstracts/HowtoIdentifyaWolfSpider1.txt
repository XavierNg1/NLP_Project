Look at the arrangement of their eight eyes.
See if the spider has three tarsal claws to make sure it’s a Wolf spider.
Don’t confuse the Wolf spider with a Brown Recluse spider.
Check for hairs covering its abdomen.This is why you may confuse the Wolf spider with a Tarantula, but most Wolf spiders are a great deal smaller than most Tarantulas.

Learn the rules for assigning oxidation state.
Split the reaction into two half-reactions.
Assign oxidation states to each element in the equation.
Determine if one species is oxidized and one is reduced.
Split reaction into two half-reactions.
Balance all elements in the equation except hydrogen and oxygen.
Balance the oxygen atoms by adding H2O to the opposite side of the reaction.
Balance hydrogen atoms by adding H+ to the opposite of the equation.
Equalize the charges by adding electrons to the proper side of the equation.
Multiply each half-reaction by a scaling factor so that the electrons are equal in both half-reactions.
Combine the two half-reactions.
Double-check that each side of your equation has the same charge.

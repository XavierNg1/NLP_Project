The first thing to do is to check out the controls and make sure you know them well.
Remember when playing campaign, listen closely to the instructions.
Spawn as a marine or pilot and fly the transport to the enemy hangar.
Go over to the ammo and health droids and load up on both.
Take a right and go into the engine room.
Leave the engine room but watch out for the auto turrets.
By now you should be close to the frenzy bonus, which is 12 kills with the blaster rifle.
As for killing Jedi/Sith, shotguns work well.
If you get stuck on a level, don't freak out.
Use your surroundings to help you.
Pick your trooper class according to the battle and the task at hand.
If you're about to die and there's no way out, throw a grenade or set off a det pack or lay some mines.
Use the ammo and health droids.

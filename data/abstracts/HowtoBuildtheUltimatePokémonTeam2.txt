Blissey is a good choice.
Poison Pok√©mon are good stallers as well.
Umbreon makes an awesome Wish passer, and can dish out Payback with Wish/Toxic/Payback/Guard Swap.
Gourgeist-super with Phantom Force/Will-o-Wisp/Synthesis/Toxic can only be killed off by Heatran.

,
Run a Ground type to take care of Heatran, which can wall near everything on a stall team.

Fairies are basically the Arceus of taking a special hit, so use one.
Finally, Milotic is a strong defensive choice.

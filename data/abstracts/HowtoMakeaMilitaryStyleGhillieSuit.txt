Dye your burlap by filling buckets with fabric dye and hot water.
Hang your burlap sacks to dry.
Cut off the bottom and side stitching of the burlap sack.
Using your fingers or a large-tooth comb, separate the individual strands of jute from the material.
Cut your netting to the same size as the panels of fabric on your BDUs that are exposed when you're lying down.
Attach your netting onto the back of your BDUs using a combination of the following; unwaxed dental floss (high tensile strength and because if no wax, it holds a knot a LOT better and does not rot like thread will over time) and ShoeGoo.
Attach a piece of 2'x4'netting onto your boonie hat or ball cap style camo hat in the same fashion.
Taking between 8 and 16 strands of jute of the same color at a time, tie them onto the netting using an over hand knot.
Keep in mind, you want to create a "mounding" affect that breaks up the outline of the human shape.

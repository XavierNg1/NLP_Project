Research a good monologue for yourself.
After you have chosen your monologue, go over it.
Find some "key" words, and emphasize them.
Try to fill the shoes of your character.
Don't forget to practice, practice and practice some more!,
Be sure to make eye contact with your audience, as that makes them feel as if they are a part of your monologue.
Try to keep it real every time.
Finally, you are ready!

Master the look.
Wear denim.
Spike you hair and give it definition.
Hoist your hair up into a high ponytail and wind it into a bun or keep it down and curly, accessorise with ribbons, clips and really anything you want!,
Wear the right Makeup.
Be a little more sarcastic.
Pretend your life is bleak.
Interfere with the afterlife and the paranormal.
Remember Lydia is only a character!

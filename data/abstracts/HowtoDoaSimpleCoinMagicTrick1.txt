Start your trick by telling your audience that you're going to magically switch a coin from one hand to the other.
Close your hand into a fist, but make the tiniest gap created by your index finger of the hand.
Move your hand over your other hand, dropping the coin in without opening your fist.
Ask a volunteer to say which hand the coin is in.
Slowly reveal both hands, the original hand empty and the new hand with the coin.

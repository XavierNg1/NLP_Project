Ask yourself why you want new cell phone ringtones.
Check in magazines or online for various ringtones.
Choose just a few ringtones.
Talk to Your Parents.
Explain why you want your ringtones.
Suggest a way of making it up.
Stick to your compromise.
If they say no, don't start whining.If they DO say no, find a good website that doesn't spam (I would recommend either mytinyphone.com or zedge.com)

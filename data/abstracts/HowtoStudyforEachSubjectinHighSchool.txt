First, we'll go over the four basic subjects.
Maths is actually the most basic out of the four.
Sciences are quite like maths, the answers are in the book right in front of you.
Languages are mostly vocabulary.
If it's a foreign language such as Spanish or French, think of it like an English class.
History is one of the most textbook intensive courses.

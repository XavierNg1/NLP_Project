Consider whether or not you have to adhere to a budget.
Try to anticipate just exactly how many this confection has to serve.
See if anyone you know has any recommendations for any bakery that has served them successfully.
Many of them will have portfolios featuring pictures of their past creations to give you a better idea of what they are capable of producing.
Make an appointment with the one or two bakeries you like to have a cake tasting.
Try to have an idea of what you might prefer, as well as the possible preferences of any guests, especially the members of either family, but be open to new combinations you might be offered.
Discuss what kind of cake you would like to have as well as the wedding cake topper that will look best with it.
If you have a preference for cake topper (like a ceramic or porcelain piece or using fresh flowers that reflect those used for the bridal bouquet or other decorations), now is the time to discuss them.
If you follow these guidelines, you will find that you have a greater success in getting the perfect cake and topper just for you.

Change the definition of diaper.
Have talk show hosts discuss bedwetting.
Ask celebrities to talk about their experiences dealing bedwetting when they were growing up.
Ask physicians, especially specialists such as urologists, to counsel patients about the different types of diapers available to deal with bedwetting.
One thing that would help reduce the stigma in this area would be if the people who wrote parenting books did not have such negative reactions to older children using diapers to deal with their bedwetting.
One other thing to consider is the following-as a society we seem to have no problem with the following people using diapers: the elderly,special needs individuals, as well people suffering from diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and other neurodegenerative disorders, but we look down on older children, teenagers, and adults who want to wear(or have no choice but to wear) diapers to manage their bedwetting.
Finally, manufacturers of adult diapers could advertise their products in an attempt to make their products more well known.Parents might request to stores that they carry these types of products, and then perhaps grocery stores, places such as Walmart and Target, as well as pharmacies might be be more inclined to stock these products.This in turn might cause a ripple effect-if more stores start stocking diapers that fit older children, teenagers, and adults with bedwetting problems, more people would be likely to buy them, thereby reducing the stigma of wearing these garments.

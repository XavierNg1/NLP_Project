Visit various prep schools and decide if prep school is right for you.
Decide what schools to apply to.
Schedule an interview.
Begin working on your application- this year some school's applications will be available on August 15.
Register for the SSAT/ISEE- these tests are important, but not the deciding factor in prep school decisions.
Give your teachers your letters of recommendations - Some teachers will take a week and some will take a month.
Start writing your essays!- You should begin working on these around October at the earliest, and November at the latest.
Contact coaches/special interest teachers.
Provide the school with a single envelope into which all the recommendations can be placed, if possible.
Wait, wait, and wait!

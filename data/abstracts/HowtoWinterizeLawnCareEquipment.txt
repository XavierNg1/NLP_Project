Decide when it is time to put your mower and other gasoline powered lawn tools away for the winter.
Thoroughly clean the tool.
Allow the fuel level in the gas tank to run as low as possible so any remaining fuel can be burned up by allowing the engine to idle briefly.
Run the engine until it dies from lack of fuel.
Remove the air filter/filter assembly, as required to access the carburetor throat/intake.
Remove the spark plug and position the plug wire as far from the intake as possible.
Check the tires, mower deck, belts, pulleys, and other attachments to make sure they are in good condition.
Cover the engine with a plastic sheet or an old table cloth.

Gather your supplies.
Fill a sink with enough water to submerge your jeans and mix in a little bit of baby shampoo.
Let the jeans soak in the water for about half an hour.
Take the jeans out of the sink and squeeze the water out.
Roll the jeans up in a large towel to soak up any excess moisture.
Gently press down on the towel, then take the jeans out.
Spread the jeans on a fresh, dry towel.
Gently tug on the jean legs until you get them to be the length you want.
Allow the jeans to dry.

Launch the Microsoft Excel 2010 program.
Locate the equation you plan on solving and re-arrange the equation to equal zero.
Figure out your expected number of roots (solutions).
Select cells to work with.
Label a cell “X-value” and an adjacent cell in the same row “Equ=0”.
In the row below “X-Value” in the same column, put in a guess value for x.
In the row below “Equ=0” in the same column, put in your re-arranged equation using the X-value guess in step 3 as your variable.
Find and click the “Data” tab on the top of the Excel spreadsheet.

,
Click “What-if Analysis” and select “Goal Seek” from the drop down tab.

,
Click the cell used to input your equation in Part 2, Step 4 under the "Set Value" field.

,
Type in zero under the "To value" field (see figure above).
Click the cell used to input your guess x-value under the “By changing cell” field(see figure above).
Press “Ok” to solve.
Find the lower root by entering another guess for the X-Value.
Repeat all steps in part 3 for the different guess.
Prove your answers though graphical methods or algebraic (factoring methods).

Fertilize Hoya plants with a balanced, water-soluble houseplant fertilizer.
Adjust the frequency that you feed your plant based on the plantâ€™s health.
Water your plant before fertilizing it.
Do not remove the spent flower stems after your Hoya blooms.
Repot Hoyas only when they are completely pot-bound.
Use a peat-based commercial potting soil that contains perlite for improved drainage.
Turn the Hoya on its side and gently pull it out of the old container.
Set the Hoya in the new container.

Wash your hands.
Donâ€™t touch the inside of your nose or mouth.Since CMV is absorbed through the mucous membranes, keeping your hands out of the nose and mouth is a crucial step in preventing infection.
Avoid contact with blood.
Be extra careful if your immune system is compromised.Individuals with HIV/AIDS or another autoimmune deficiency should take extra steps to avoid contracting CMV.

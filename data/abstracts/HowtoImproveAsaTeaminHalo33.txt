Choose appropriate roles for the players.
Whilst this may sound a good idea, it is much better if all players in the team are proficient with all weapons to avoid any weaknesses, though it shows that teammates are evaluating themselves and other members of the team which is good.
Main Slayer: If you consistently come highest on your team with kills, and use power weapons effectively, you are probably the main slayer.
Sniper Support: Unlike the Main Slayer, the Sniper Support player does not aim to actually kill the opposing team, they will take the shot if they can, but their main goal is to put the pressure on the opposing team to find and kill them, thus distracting them from the flag or actual kill count.

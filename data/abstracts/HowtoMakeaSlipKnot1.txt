Pinching with two fingers, pick up the yarn roughly 6-8" from the end.
Twist your fingers clockwise to make the yarn cross over, forming a loop.
Put your two fingers inside the loop, expanding it out.
Using the fingers in the loop, grab the standing yarn and pull it partially through.
Pull the tail of the yarn to tighten the knot about halfway.
Slide your knitting needle or crochet hook into the loop and pull both ends of yarn tight.

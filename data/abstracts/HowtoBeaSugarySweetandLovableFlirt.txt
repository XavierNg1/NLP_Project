Wear colorful floral tops.
Have nice jewelry.
Wash your hair at least every other day.
Make your eyes look big using eye makeup.
Smile at everybody.
If you have a boyfriend, don't keep it private!,
If someone is mean to you, don't be mean back.
Do all your homework and try your best.
Save your money, and buy something nice.
Flirt!,
Eat healthy, drink lots of water, and get enough sleep.

Clear the room of all furnishings, decorations, light and outlet covers.
Move anything that can't be removed to the center of the room and cover it in plastic to protect against splatters of paint.
Give the room a thorough cleaning.
Put paper all around the edges of the room.
Fill in any nail holes, small dents, hairline cracks, etc, with a lightweight spackle.
Clean the walls/surfaces to be painted.
Priming is another important step in preparing walls for paint.
Cut in about an inch from the ceiling and baseboard with matching color (typically white).
Finally, tape off all adjacent walls, woodwork, light switches, etc, with painter's tape to protect adjacent surfaces.

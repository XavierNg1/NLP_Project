Sometimes people don't have to put you down.
Think about when you've been at your happiest, when a lovely boy/girl who ticks all your boxes is smiling at you and hanging off every word you say or when you've been walking around feeling like you were ten foot tall because you'd just achieved what everyone said could not be done.
When you've done this, read through it all again and again until you remember every moment of it.
There has to be some goal you've been wanting to achieve but never got round to it because you put it off till tomorrow or never-never.
Ignore the voices in your head or the ones who put you down.
Life is too short, when you want to do something, do it.

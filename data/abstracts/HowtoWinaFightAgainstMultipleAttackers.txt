Remember the phrase: "TANSTAAFF".
Remember, when attacked by multiple assailants who want nothing more than to hurt you, ANYTHING goes.

,
Create a solid base.
Work your defense.
If they are coming at you, however, do not wait to defend.
When punching, hit with the heel of your palm, not your fist.
To put power behind your punches, swing your hips into the punch.
Never take the fight to the ground when multiple assailants are involved.
If you have beat them badly enough to create an opening, run.

Make a holder for a bar magnet.
Bend a paperclip into a hook.
Add further paperclips to measure the strength of the magnet.
Note the number of paperclips that caused the hook to fall off.
Add masking tape to the magnet pole.
Add paperclips to the hook until it falls off the magnet.
Write down how many clips it took to make the hook fall this time.
Repeat the previous steps several times with more strips of masking tape.

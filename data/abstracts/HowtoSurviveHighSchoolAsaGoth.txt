Ignore people who insult you; the worst thing you can do is start a full fledged fight with them.
Be yourself, and stay original.
Make friends with emos, punks, and the other goths; oftentimes, they go through the same teasing you do, so they'll be able to relate to you better.
Be nice to everyone.
Focus on your academics.
Find healthy ways to express yourself; try writing poetry, dancing, singing, or knitting.

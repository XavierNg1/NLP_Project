Obtain the probability of nodal involvement by reference to factors such as clinical palpability, tumour size, lymphovascular invasion etc.
Obtain the probability of false negative pertaining to a sample of n nodes.
Call the desired probability of nodal involvement on the basis of a pathologic analysis of the sampled nodes the posterior probability.
Alternatively, read the posterior probability from Table 2 below, which is found to be approximately 1% for a woman whose prior probability equals 20% and all 5 nodes sampled from her are found to be clear.

Cut off all communication.
Spend all of your free time with people that made you happy before this relationship.
Find your spiritual side.
Never go to sleep in silence, make sure you have a radio, CD, DVD on in the back ground.
Eating may be the last thing on your mind, you may eat more than normal, or be barely eating at all, but make sure you eat healthily to keep yourself motivated and healthy-minded.

,
Don't drown yourself in alcohol.
Keep your family close.
Never think no one will ever love you again like they did.
Don't throw yourself at new partners too quickly or easily.
Stay away from love films and love songs that bring back memories of your old partner.

,
Don't let yourself go.
If you find yourself continually thinking of them, count to 100 in your head, and then think of something else.

,
Even if you feel like you can't go on, keep a smile on your face.
Places where you used to go together, go with a friend.
Think how lucky you are each and everyday for your health and family.

,
Do something to keep you occupied.

,
Don't go where you know they'll be on purpose.

,
Just smile!

When you get to the spot where the game gives you the “look” option, there should be a side path that leads behind a house.
Run around the village and collect as much ammo as you can without killing people.
Know the terrain.
When you walk into the village, go into all of the houses to collect items like grenades and ammo, etc.
After you have collected all your items, walk into the last house and watch the video that will start automatically.
Run upstairs and get the shotgun.

In the video, you saw a ladder crash into the upstairs window.
Break another adjacent window (running past – or shooting – the villages lying in wait outside it) and jump out onto the roof of the shack next door.
When you get to the very end where you are standing on a roof there is a jewel on the ledge.
Shoot any and all villagers who come your way.
Whenever you get a chance to go and get the items that fall from dead villagers, gather them up; if you don’t, the ending video will come and it will take you to the middle of the village and the items will not be there when you get back.

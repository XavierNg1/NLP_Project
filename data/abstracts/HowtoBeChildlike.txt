Get up tomorrow and start a new life.
Don’t take yourself so seriously.
Think like a kid again.
 Stop worrying about what others think of you.
Greet everyone you meet like you were a child.
Forgive as a child forgives.
Say hello to everyone you meet.
Believe in yourself.
Look forward to good things to come.

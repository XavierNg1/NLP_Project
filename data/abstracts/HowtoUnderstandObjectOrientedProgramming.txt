Understand that there are generally three main parts to object oriented programming.
In Object-Oriented Programming Languages, programs are designed with the concept of objects, where each object contains its own set of variables to store data about or relevant to that object, and functions to perform action (like outputting text or making an API call to the operating system), perform calculations, add data to variables inside the object, etc.
Objects represent various things in a program, like a Square.
In the case a math program was intended to calculate the area of not only squares, but other shapes, such as a circle, "Inheritance" would be used.
Many programmers have a hard time deciding which programming language to use.

Begin by cutting a 6 x 9" piece of #140, cold press watercolor paper.
Place the paper on a sheet of heavy cardboard or foam core board larger than the paper, but don't mount it to the board.
Draw in pencil, a line two inches up from the bottom to separate the sky from the earth. 

,
Set up your palette by squeezing 1/2 inch amounts of tube watercolors;  red, yellow and blue.
Use a large brush for each color.
Load your brush to almost dripping with one of the colors and working from left to right paint a single, juicy stroke from side to side.
Repeat as many times as you wish until you reach the pencil line for the earth.
Prepare paints for the earth by squeezing out 1/4 inch amounts of browns, greys and black.
Paint the earth strip by mixing dark colors randomly.

,
Do your research.
Plan the amount of space the tree will take on the paper by sketching in pencil the position of the trunk.
Draw or paint the tree using dark media such as Sharpie markers, a fine brush and India Ink or opaque water color.

,
Bear in mind that the trunk and branches tend to taper and get smaller as they grow upward.

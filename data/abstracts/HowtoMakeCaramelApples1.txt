Wash the apples and pull the stems off.
Insert a wooden stick into each stem hole, and place the apples in the fridge.
Cover a baking sheet with wax paper.
Melt the caramel candies in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring with a rubber spatula until smooth.
Remove the saucepan from heat, and dip an apple into the caramel.
Scrape the bottom of the apple with a spoon or knife.
Place the apple on the baking sheet and continue dipping the other apples into the caramel.
Refrigerate the apples for 1 to 2 hours.

Understand how a chorale works.
Look at accidentals.
Start by harmonizing the final cadence.
Look through the rest of the part you have to harmonize, work out possible chords, and lightly pencil them in, starting with the cadences, and then move on to the remaining chords.
Fill in the rest of the chords.
Go through and try to put in any suspensions (the most common are 4-3 in the Alto at a cadence and a 7-6 in the Tenor in the middle) and dissonances such as 7ths.
Go through and check all pairs of voices making sure that the two parts never move up or down in perfect fifths, octaves, or in unison.
Play it (or get someone to play it for you) on a piano and listen carefully.

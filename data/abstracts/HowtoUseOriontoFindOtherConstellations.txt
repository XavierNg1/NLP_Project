Know where Orion is.
Memorize the "corner" stars in Orion.
Time to start navigating!,
Continue following Saiph and Bellatrix and you will encounter Perseus, the hero from Greek mythology.
Follow Rigel and Betelgeuse, the two brightest stars in Orion, up to enter Gemini and view its two brightest stars, Castor and Pollux.
Tracing from Bellatrix to Betelgeuse leads to Canis Minor, shining with the bright stars Procyon and Gomeisa.
Draw an imaginary line from Rigel to Bellatrix and you will crash into Capella, the brightest star in the constellation Auriga.
After you have found these stars, use them to find more constellations.

Make your basic risotto recipe.
When the rice is opaque, add 1 cup of stock and stir well.
When this is absorbed, add the next cup of stock.
Keep stirring and add the next cup.
Allow to simmer gently.
Add the final cup of wine or stock and add your seasonings and/or grated cheese.
Allow this cup to absorb then taste the rice & veges to see if its cooked through.
Stir before serving and add salt & pepper to taste, or a little cream if desired for extra creaminess.
Finished.

Get your glove, uniform, and get ready to play.
Â Position yourself in right center most of the time, because the majority of hitters in little league through college level bat right handed.
Be on your toes, never wander around, be alert, and don't daydream.

,
Know the situation.
When the ball is hit to center, back the center fielder up just in case he misses.
If the ball is hit to you don't panic!,
If there are men on base, try to get behind the ball so you can charge in and have momentum for your crow hop, and throw to the cutoff man.

,
When you run, treat your glove like a hand.
Use two hands to squeeze once the ball hits your glove, your throwing hand trapping the ball in the glove pocket for the catch.
If you catch it, then throw it back to the cut off man.
If you miss, that's okay.
You will get more ground balls than fly balls at most levels of baseball.
On a ground ball, charge the ball until you are ready to field it.

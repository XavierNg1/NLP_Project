Draw colder air into the conservatory.
Install roof vents.
Have some form of opening and closing the conservatory roof vents.
Install conservatory ceiling fans - in the summer a ceiling fan will provide a down draught that will aid cooling and by reversing the direction of the fan in the winter they can re-circulate warm air trapped at the top of the roof downwards.
Install extractor fans - it can make frequent changes of air in the conservatory, and modern technology and designs mean that they are virtually silent when running under normal circumstances.

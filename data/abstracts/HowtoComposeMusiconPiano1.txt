Listen to piano music.There is a vast amount of incredible music written specifically for the piano.
Practice scales on the piano.
Carry a notebook and handheld recorder wherever you go.You never know when you're going to hit a creative stride.
Give yourself a break.
Think about what you might like to write music about.Most music (even instrumental music) is directly inspired by something or someone.

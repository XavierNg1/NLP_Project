Describe cats.
Depict the cat's body, head, tail and legs, in shorthand, on a practice page of watercolor paper.
Trace an outline of a circle onto a piece of 11 x 14 inch piece of watercolor paper using pencil and a dinner plate as a template.
Pencil in cats going around the circle.Choose wisely for the centermost cat, as all roads will lead the viewer's eye to that bulls eye.
Activate your paints with water.
Paint around the cats in a color that will show them off.

Obtain an aquarium tank.
Make the tank a crabitat.
Divide your tank in half between land and water.The easiest way is to dump substrate into one end of the tank and water into the other end, mimicking the natural blending of bodies of water into the littoral (shoreline).
Place some plastic plants, nooks and toys in the tank.
Feed and water your crabs.
Keep the tank warm.
Donâ€™t worry about fiddler fights.
Maintain the environment properly.

The Gregorian Calendar ,
Years


Years divisible by 4 are leap years,…
with the exception that years divisible by 100 are not leap years,…
with the exception that years divisible by 400 are leap years.
Months


January, March, May, July, August, October, and December have 31 days.
Days


In any given year (even a leap year), “Doomsdays” are all on the same day of the week.
Now that you know how the Gregorian calendar works, you can use your knowledge to…


Calculate the Day of the Week in Your Head From the Year, Month, and Day
Number-days
“Number-days” are numbers that are associated with days of the week by a mnemonic.
Definitions of Year-days and Century-days


The “Year-day” of any given year is the day of the week on which all of its Doomsdays lie.
Calculating Big Tuesdays (400 Years)


The Year-day of every year divisible by 400 is Tuesday.
Calculating Century-days (100 Years)


If you are not in a Big Tuesday-century, then you can find the Century-day as follows.
Calculating Dozen-days (12 Years)


The “Dozen-year” of any given year is the largest year that is both less than or equal to the given year and that has the property that the positive difference of itself and the Century-year is divisible by 12.
Calculating Quad-days (4 Years)


The “Quad-year” of any given year is the greatest number that is both less than or equal to the given year and divisible by 4.
Calculating Year-days (1 Year)


If the given year is not divisible by 4, like 1642, then subtract the Quad-year from the given year.
Calculating Doomsdays (Months and Days)


Once you know the Year-day, you know the day of the week of every Doomsday in that year.
Calculating Days of the Week (Days)


If you’re given a date like 4/20/1642, which is not a Doomsday, then simply find the nearest Doomsday by repeatedly adding or subtracting 7 to known Doomsdays.

Treat her like a normal girl, that is, politely.
Ask her out like you would to a normal girl.
Do not embarrass her by trying to make her drink, smoke or do drugs.
Do not kill insects in her presence.
Attempt to be genuinely interested in her beliefs once in a while.
Don't be a sleaze.
Remember that she will approach things from a Buddhist viewpoint, which may be alien at times, especially to those of theist religions.

Read books on HER TRADITION of Buddhism to understand where she is coming from.
If you are religious but not Buddhist, look for similarities and shared experiences to make the relationship stronger BECAUSE of this point- if you are both religious, you already share much common ground of ethics and morality.
If you are not religious, she shares many common points with you, too, such as not worshipping a God or Gods and rejection of superstition and dogma.

Don't touch her shrine, her chanting beads, statuary, books, under any circumstances.
Don't ever say anything bad about her Teacher, her Buddhist community, or monks or nuns unless it's really important to you.
She may wake up very early in the morning and spend long hours chanting in a language you don't understand.
Buddhists like to laugh about their spirituality.
If incense is a problem for you because of allergies, asthma, etc. ask her to burn a smokeless variety or do without.

Every now and then she may get the inclination to go shave her head and be a nun.
Do you think she spends too much time on a temple or monastery?

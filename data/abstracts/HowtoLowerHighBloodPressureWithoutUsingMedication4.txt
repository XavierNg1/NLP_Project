Slow down to help your body relax from stress.
Meditate.
Breathe deeply and slowly but not so slow as to cause discomfort, and listen to music if you like, while relaxing to lower blood pressure.
Take a soaking hot bath or hot shower for 15 minutes which can actually suppress one's blood pressure for several hours.

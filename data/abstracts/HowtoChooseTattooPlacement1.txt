Consider your design.
For a large design, such as a portrait or a character, choose areas of skin that are easy for your artist to access without making you contort yourself.
For very small, simple designs, you may prefer a more whimsical placement.
Some designs wrap around a limb, such as the tribal band, or the string of rosary beads.

Select a section of tree trunk to begin with.
Cut down your tree and trim it to length, then trim any sharp branches and limbs as close to the trunk as possible.
Make a straight, square cut on the base of your trunk.
Square the ends of the trunk (or trunks, if the tree has a fork) with a saw so platforms will sit level on them.
Build a solid base for your trunk to sit on.
Mount the trunk on your base with large wood screws or lag bolts.
Fasten deck boards on the top of the tree truck with one edge flush with the trunk to allow your cat to access the deck.
Set a small house, or a basket or other feature on the deck for the cat to lay in.
Attach strips of carpet or wind a small rope around the trunk of the tree house to give your cat something to grip easily when climbing the contraption.
Stain, paint, or leave the wood in its natural condition if desired.

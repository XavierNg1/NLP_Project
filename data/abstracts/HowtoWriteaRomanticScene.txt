Consider what you’re comfortable writing.
Keep your audience in mind.Who will be reading the story in which your romance scene occurs?,
Think about the relationship between the characters.Every romance scene is unique because they occur between two specific characters at a particular time in their lives.
Set the stakes for the scene.The reader wants the scene to be more than a purely physical interaction.
Consider how the scene fits into the surrounding story.
Describe the setting.The setting can almost be a third character in a romance scene.
Choose the point of view, if necessary.
Include realistic details.When writing any scene — but especially a romantic scene — you should always think about similar experiences in your life.
Don’t oversell the interaction.
Build tension with pacing.The romantic scene should begin before the characters ever touch each other.
Avoid clichéd language.The best way to avoid cliched writing is to be able to recognize it.
Use dialogue to develop the scene.In the movies, you might see a romantic scene with no dialogue.
Develop emotion over physical sequence.You might think readers want to read about the physical kissing and touching, but what they really respond to is the emotion of the moment.

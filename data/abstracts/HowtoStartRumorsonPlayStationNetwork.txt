Select a friend and select the option to send them a new message.
Type a subject that's eye-catching and is about your rumor, but doesn't give away very many details.
Type the rumor in the message box.
Copy your message.

Send it to that friend and all of your other friends except one.
Send it to the people in your "Players Met List".

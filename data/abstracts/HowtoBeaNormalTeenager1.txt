Spend time with people who are doing "positive activities" that you want to do.
Be happier by not hanging around people who act out in negative, too wild or crazy ways.
Pay attention to the body language of others.
Be a good listener and wait for your turn to speak.
Draw your personal boundaries.
Make your room an awesome sanctuary.

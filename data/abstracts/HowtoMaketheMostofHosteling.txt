Pack light.
Research the hostel you're planning to stay at in advance.
Take careful note of hostel rules.
Get to the hostel during daylight hours if possible.
Ask to see the room (or bed) you're paying for before you finish checking in.
If you're staying in a dorm room, opt for the bottom bunk.
Bring your own towel, soap and shampoo--they're not always available in a hostel and, if they are, they usually cost.
Try socializing with others in the hostel's common areas, and don't be put off if they join your conversations unexpectedly.

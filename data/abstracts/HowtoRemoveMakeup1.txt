Saturate a cotton pad with eye makeup remover.
Hold the cotton pad against your closed eye for about 20 seconds, applying gentle pressure.
Use a downward motion to gently wipe off makeup.Getting too rough with the delicate skin around your eyes can encourage wrinkles and fine lines.
Turn the cotton pad over and use the clean side to wipe your eye with an upward stroke.

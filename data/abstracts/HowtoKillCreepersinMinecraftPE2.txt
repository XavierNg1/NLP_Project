Before night time, when creepers come out, dig a hole in the ground.
Find a creeper.
Run up to the trap, as you are faster than the creeper.
Move around the trap until you get to the opposite side of the creeper.
Go to bed if it is night.
Hit the creeper continuously, until it dies.
Jump in and collect any gunpowder it has given you.

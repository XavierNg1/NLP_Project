Get your action bar in order.When you are in a dungeon, most of the time you spend running after other party members so you can heal them, and you won't get a chance to organize during combat.
Never loot during combat.It is very rude to loot corpses of enemies while other members are fighting and need heals, this will get you kicked out of a group and it can end really bad if someone dies while you collect coppers.

,
Potions, elixirs, scrolls.Before going on a battleground or entering a dungeon, put all your mana potions in one bag and keep it open all the time.
Don't waste mana.
Keep an eye on health bars.It is important for you to pay as much attention to your health bar as it is to your allies'.
Don't pull unless asked to.If you have a group and someone is clearly pulling don't go first and be the hero, you don't have required abilities to defend yourself (it is tank's work).
Equipment is essential.When you are the shaman healer, you need items with spirit and intellect.
Use Healing Rain.
Use Earthshield.
Use Totems.
Use a Watershield or Earth living Weapon.
Use Haste/Spirit.
Use Chain Heal or Riptide.
Use Glyphs.
Use Talents.
Ask for help.

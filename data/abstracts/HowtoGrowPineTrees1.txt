Choose the species of pine that is the best for your soil and your climate.
Decide between using bare-root seedlings or seedlings grown in a container.
Lightly water the root system and rearrange it if necessary.
Choose the right area to plant your pine tree.
Choose a good day for planting.
Dig a hole larger than the root system and fill the bottom with topsoil.
Remove the container or burlap from the seedling.
Place the pine tree roots carefully at the bottom and cover with soil.
Lightly stake only if the tree cannot support itself.
Protect young pines from hot sun.

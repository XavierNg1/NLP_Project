If you are a lot smaller, realize that they have to reach downwards.
Avoid fighting.
If this is not an option and you are forced to protect yourself, use self defense or martial arts.
First you must "size-up" your opponent.
The goal in any street fight is survival first.
Strike first blood.
HEAD MOVEMENT AND DEFENSIVE GUARD - After striking first, either your opponent is down and you can turn and run for safety (thus ending the fight), or they are now angrier (although perhaps more respectful of your ability to hurt them).
THE BUM-RUSH - As your opponent throws strikes of their own you must be hard to hit, moving and dipping, and stepping in a circular pattern away from the attack.
THE COUNTER STRIKE - When your opponent is setting you up for attacks and throwing their strikes you may notice a few patterns that they are doing over and over again.
WORK THE ANGLES - the easiest thing to do in order to create opportunities to get inside of the range of your taller opponent is to work angles.
USE YOUR JAB - a good jab is essential for any skilled fighter.

Start from a position of authority.
Start with the "Kojak approach".
Tell the subject something along the lines of "Ok, if I don't follow up on this, the principal is going to chew my butt, so I have to ask you about this, ok?",
If you are a cop, read them their rights if needed but not in the authoritative way they do on TV, just casually like you are just trying to get through it, a formality.

Next, start with totally innocent questions, name, address, whatever; issues anyone is happy to answer.

,
Take notes as you go and make it look like you just have to make a report.
Move on to the subject at hand.
Once you are closing in on the big questions, stop asking questions and make a little speech along the lines of: Ok, now this kid says you touched her.
Next go into the moral implications.
During your speech, gradually move physically closer to the subject.
Next you go into the meaty questions.
From this point you want to ask them specific questions.
Ask specific questions like - "You put your hand on her back, didn't you?",
If you need to bust them (whatever that means for you) tell them you are just doing what you are required to do.

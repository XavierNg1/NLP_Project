If there is no portion of the key protruding from the lock to grab with pliers, use a straight blade screwdriver (or anything with a blade small enough), inserted or pressed into the keyhole.
Once unlocked, open the door and twist the screwdriver in both directions.
If you're in a hurry, lock the door with the screwdriver and leave.

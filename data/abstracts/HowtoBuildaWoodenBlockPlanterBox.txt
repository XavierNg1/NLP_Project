Set up a work table.
Draw or scribe a circle on the work surface.
Cut blocks of wood 3/4 inches wide and thick, 4 inches long.
Lay a ring of blocks around the inside of the circle you scribed on your work table.
Put a drop of quality wood glue (think Tight-Bond 3 or Liquid Nails) on each end of each block.
Place another layer of blocks on the first, staggering them to center on the joints of the first row, and keeping the edges in line.
Put a drop of glue on each end of the second row of blocks, and start your third row the same way you started the second row (layer) of blocks.
Run two or three more rows the same way you ran the previous ones, leaving a block out with each subsequent row.
Keep adding rows, but allow each row to slide inward from the previous row about 1/3 the width of your block.
Continue running rows as described earlier until there are only three or four blocks left in the top row.
Flip the whole thing over, being careful to keep it supported, and lay it flat on your work surface.
Stand the planter box up, line the bottom with plastic, fill it with potting soil, and add the plant of your choice.

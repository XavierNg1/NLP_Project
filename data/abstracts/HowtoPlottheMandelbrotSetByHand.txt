Understand the basic formula, often expressed as z = z2 + c. This simply means that, for each point in the Mandelbrot universe we wish to see, we keep calculating z until one of two conditions occur; then we color it to show how many calculations we made.
Get 3 different-colored pencils, or crayons, or felt-tipped markers, plus a black pencil or pen to make the outline.
With the black marker, draw a large tic-tac-toe board, 3 by 3 squares, on a piece of paper.

,
Label (also in black) the middle square (0, 0).
Calculate the first pass, or iteration, of the formula.
Let's try a square 3 times bigger, 9 by 9, but still keeping a maximum of 3 iterations.

,
Start with the 3rd row down, because that's where it gets interesting right away.
Continue calculating each cell until it has escaped, or you have reached the maximum number of iterations (the number of colors you're using: 3 in this example), at which point you color it.
Iterate the same matrix again with more colors (iterations) to reveal the next few layers, or better, draw up a much larger matrix for a longer-term project!

Find out which size of flag you will be building a flag display case (fdc) for.
Measure the folded flag.
Decide on the type of wood you will be using.
To cut the wood, and seeing that the flag is triangular in shape, cut the angles on a 45 degree.
Measure off the longest portion of the angled 6' board (that's your long point of that particular angle, the other is the short point of that particular angle.),
Your objective now is to turn that piece around 180 degrees, and cut the short point again in order to make it a long point.
Tack the frame together or use a strap to hold it in position.

,
Measure the size of glass you will need.
Take the piece or pieces and with the table saw in operation, slowly guide the piece along the guide.
Use small trim nails (1 1/4) long and nail frame together, with glass inserted into the cut grooves you just made (set nails with punch and color putty when done).
Take the frame and place it on some 1/4" ply (or oak paneling) and trace the outside of your frame.

,
Cut this out for the backing of your display case.
You can drill about 8 pilot holes through the 1/4" ply into the wood frame.
Insert your burial flag.

,
Insert your screws.

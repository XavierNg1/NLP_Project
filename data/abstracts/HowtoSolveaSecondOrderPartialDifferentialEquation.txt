Check whether it is hyperbolic, elliptic or parabolic.
Calculate two quantities.
Write out the two equations below.
Call your constants η{\displaystyle \eta } and ν{\displaystyle \nu }.
Calculate the partial derivatives in terms of these new coordinates.
Calculate the second partial derivatives by differentiating these again to find uxx,{\displaystyle u_{xx},} uxy,{\displaystyle u_{xy},} and uyy{\displaystyle u_{yy}}.
Plug your values for uxx,{\displaystyle u_{xx},} uxy,{\displaystyle u_{xy},} uyy,{\displaystyle u_{yy},} ux,{\displaystyle u_{x},} and uy{\displaystyle u_{y}} back into the original equation.

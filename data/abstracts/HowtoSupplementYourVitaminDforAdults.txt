Be aware that you, like many adults, in the United States at least, may be chronically vitamin D deficient.
Get all the vitamin D from sunlight you can.
Supplement vitamin D in several ways.
Use a good "whole food" vitamin as probably the best way to supplement anything dietary.
Take such a supplement--and depending upon your overall health beginning this regimen--use at least twice a day or more for the first container, then a minimum of once a day is recommended.
Supplement your diet with cod liver oil.
Directly supplement, at least D3 (the most bio~active form).

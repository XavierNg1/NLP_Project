Pour 3-4 light beers into a clean bucket.The brand of beer you use doesnâ€™t matter, nor does the quality of the beer, so this is a fairly affordable solution for lightening your hair.If you want to avoid smelling like alcohol, use flat beer for this.
Lean over the bucket and immerse your hair in the beer.Make sure that you saturate your hair evenly with the liquid.
Expose your hair to sunlight for about 1 hour.The acid in the beer will be activated by the sunlight and lighten your strands by naturally lifting the color.
Rinse the beer from your hair.

If your cat has just had kittens, then the best thing to do is to leave your cat on her own for a while.
After an hour, come back to see her and the kittens.
When your cat lets you pick up the kittens, don't move your cat or take the kitten out of the room or away from its mother.
Slowly slide your hand under the kitten's stomach.
Pinch the scruff of the kitten's neck with your other hand, but not too hard.
Slowly lift your kitten up and take your hand from underneath it.
Let go of the scruff of its neck and place the hand that was holding it underneath the kitten's front legs.
Move your hand that the kitten's back legs are on sideways against your chest while removing the hand holding its front legs.

,
Your kitten should be standing on its back legs against your chest with its front paws against your chest.
Put your free hand on its back and let it move onto the palm of the hand that is holding its back legs.

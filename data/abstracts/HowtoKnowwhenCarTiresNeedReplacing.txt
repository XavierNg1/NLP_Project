Understand that the primary function of tread on a tire is to divert water from beneath the tire to improve traction and avoid hydroplaning on wet roads.Tires become unsafe when they're worn, and once the tread is down to 1/16th of an inch (1.6mm), the tire is no longer safe.
Look at the tread pattern.
Check the tread by using the "penny test.",
Use a tread depth indicator or gauge.
Know the legal requirements.
Make note of any irregular tread wear.
Check for any abnormal bulges or "bubbles" in the sidewall.
Replace the tires at least every 6 years.
Notice a vibration in the steering wheel.
Check for dry rot.

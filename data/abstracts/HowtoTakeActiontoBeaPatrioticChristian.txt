Determine whether you are a Christian according to the Bible.
Live for and affirm Christ as an individual -- probably including regular Bible Study and prayer, church attendance, witnessing/testifying of the Truth, helping others to see the light, etc.
Respect and desire the best for your community, state, country, etc.
As an individual, be honest above all, and keep in mind that your actions will be seen and interpreted not only as an advocate of your causes, or as an officeholder, but as a Christian advocate or Christian officeholder.
Decide how and to what extent that you support the armed forces in keeping peace and/or fighting to make peace.
Support public servants as best you can, ie: the courts, officials of the courts who are assigned or elected to keep law and order, including police officers -- and also the efforts of fire and rescue personnel in peace, disaster or war.
Consider collaborating/cooperating together with others including other patriots, as much as possible: but you clearly will not agree on each and every facet of building your own community or extended community, state and nation.
Show appropriate respect as seems right to you for the symbols of your country and the symbols of Christianity, for example:


Respect prayer, reverence God, bow your head when someone prays.
Pray for your government leaders and authority that scripture says were put (or allowed) there by God.
Examine factors that define you as a patriotic person as a Christian (subordinated to God) -- whether conservative, independent, liberal, or libertarian -- and decide whether you are a patriotic Christian by the indications of what you perceive as loving and devoted patriotism as you believe is right.

Mix enough paint to do your project.
Thin the paint with a suitable thinner.
Fill the paint cup about 2/3 of the way with paint and lock it onto the sprayer.
Hold the sprayer about 5–10 inches (12.7–25.4 cm) from the surface.
Squeeze the trigger to spray the paint.
Overlap each pass slightly.
Refill the paint cup as needed until the project is done.
Allow the paint to dry, then re coat if desired.

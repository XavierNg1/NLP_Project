Have a pity party.
Do not replace a single thing with a gluten-free alternative!,
Look at your current diet and through your pantry and refrigerator to find the foods and meals you already eat that are gluten-free.
Give yourself permission to eat things that you may have restricted from your diet before your diagnosis.
Look at your current menus and meals and find ways to eliminate gluten from your diet.
Really consider what are your favorite parts of your current meals.
Clear out any and all foods that have gluten, wheat, wheat flour, oats, oat flour, rye, semolina, or modified food starch from your pantry.
Plan and prepare your meals ahead of time.
When you feel courageous, add a gluten-free alternative to a meal.

Confirm the directions to your destination if you are driving to an unknown location so that you are not forced to make turns, change lanes, or stop unexpectedly.
Pay attention to the road ahead of you, especially when you are driving down residential or busy, car-lined streets.
Avoid distractions like your cell phone and other people in the car.
Don't drive too close to the back of other vehicles.
Accommodate for bad weather, and avoid driving altogether when the roads are wet, slushy, foggy, or slippery, if at all possible.
Don't lose your cool with other drivers.
Remember that you have a blind spot over your shoulder, so if you are taking a corner or changing lanes, don't rely on your mirrors alone.
Check your rear-view mirrors every 5 - 8 seconds, especially when you are slowing down, so that you are aware of what is going on around you.
Maintain your vehicle on a regular basis.

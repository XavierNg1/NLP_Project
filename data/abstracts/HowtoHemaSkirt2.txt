Determine how long you want your skirt to be, then add 5/8 inch (1.59 centimeters) to it.
Draw a line around the skirt where you need to cut it, then cut along that line.
Using a sewing machine, straight stitch a line ¼ inch (0.63 centimeters) away from the cut edge.
Fold the hem inward, with the stitching right at the folded edged, and press it flat with an iron.
Fold them hem inward by another ¼ inch (0.63 centimeters), and press it flat with an iron again.
Stitch the hem down, 1/8 inch (0.32 centimeters) from the top folded edge.
Press the hem one last time.

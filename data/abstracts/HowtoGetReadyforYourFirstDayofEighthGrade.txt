Go school shopping.
Donâ€™t bring all of your supplies at once - walking into the school on the first day with a crippling backpack is not a good idea.
The night before the first day, set out the clothes you are planning to wear.
Get your needed amount of sleep.
On the morning of the first day, get up early enough to have time to spare.
Smile, and enjoy your first day of eighth grade!

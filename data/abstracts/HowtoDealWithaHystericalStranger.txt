Figure out WHY the person in front of us is acting hysterically.
Be aware that there isn't always a quick answer, or anything you can do.
Be prepared to defend yourself.
Ask someone to help you if the stranger has not left you alone.
Ignore the other person completely and persistently continue you way.

Make a tee out of an old 1.5-liter bottle for a quick and easy kicking platform.
Clean out the bottle and remove any labels.
Use a boxcutter, sharp knife, or a fresh pair of scissors to cut the bottom off the bottle.
Make a mark 4.5" from the bottom of the bottle.
Make a mark 9" from the bottom of the bottle directly opposite your first mark.
Connect your two marks with a circle around the entire bottle.
Cut along your outline to make the tee.
Customize your tee to make it heavier or suit it to your needs.

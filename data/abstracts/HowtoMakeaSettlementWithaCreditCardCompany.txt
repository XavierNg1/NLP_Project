Gather financial information, including information about your assets, debts and financial resources.
Contact the credit card company and try to convince the company of 3 facts--you can't pay all of your debts; you won't lose a valuable car or a home if you're forced into bankruptcy, (which would deprive the company of most of what you owe); and you don't earn enough money to justify a credit card company's attempt to reorganize your debt in a Chapter 13 proceeding.
Negotiate a settlement that allows you to pay off the new balance and live within your means.
Negotiate to pay back the new balance as quickly as possible.

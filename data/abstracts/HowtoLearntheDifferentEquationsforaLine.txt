Memorize these LINE FORMULAS and the SLOPE FORMULA:



Learn that the Point-Slope Form for the equation of a Line in the Cartesian Plane is: (y - y1) = m*(x - x1), where {x1), y1)} designates the Cartesian coordinates of a point on the line, {x, y} designates the Cartesian coordinates of a second point on the line, and m = the slope of the line.
Learn that Slope m (or sometimes a, as in y = ax + b) is equal to the equation (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), where again, {x1, y1} designates the Cartesian coordinates of a point on the line and {x2, y2} designates the Cartesian coordinates of a second point on the line.
Here is a simple graph of a line.

Since Amx Mod X is a Metamod plugin, make sure you have installed Metamod.
Download both the Base package and the Mod Addon package for your Half-Life mod.
Extract the Base package, then extract the Mod Addon package to the same directory.
Move (or upload) the extracted directory addons/amxmodx to the directory <mod>/addons.
Check the directory structure.
Add a line to Metamod plugin file <mod>/metamod/plugins.ini , then save it.
Run the server and type "meta list" in the server console to check if Amx Mod X is successfully installed.

Gather your materials.
Now that you have your materials ready begin creating the bottom half of a box with the paper.
Now that the first half of your cube has been created add some gram weights, which can be purchased online or in store at a wide range of locations, into the box.
Now place your newly created paperweight where it is needed you could also decorate it by drawing on it with a pen or use origami paper for designs to make it a little more festive.

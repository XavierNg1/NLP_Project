Tape the father.
Do this several times a day.

Provide active stimulation.
Be attentive to your baby's wants and needs.

Play and talk to your baby often.
Respond to every cry as quickly as you can and you will see that his/her cries will slowly disappear.

Work with your baby a little bit each day.

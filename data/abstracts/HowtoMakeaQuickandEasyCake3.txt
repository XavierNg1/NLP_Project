Prepare the strawberries.
Beat the heavy cream until it forms stiff peaks.
Add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract.
Use a rubber spatula to spread some of the whipped cream onto the bottom of a 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 33.02 centimeters) baking dish.
Cover the bottom of the dish with several graham crackers.
Divide the whipped cream into fourths.
Using a rubber spatula, spread one-fourth of the whipped cream on top of the graham crackers.
Add a single layer of sliced strawberries.
Repeat the graham cracker, cream, and strawberry layer three more times.
Finish off with a final layer of graham crackers and the rest of the whipped cream.
Garnish the top of the cake with the strawberries you set aside earlier.
Prepare the ganache, if desired.
Drizzle the ganache over the top of your cake.
Refrigerate the cake for at least 4 hours.

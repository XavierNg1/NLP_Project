Before getting started with the spa treatment, arrange on the floor, in front of a comfortable chair, a towel big enough to fit a large bowl on.
In a large saucepan, heat 2 cups of milk and 7 cups of water until it is as hot as you can stand.
When the milk/water mix is ready, put it in a bowl large enough to fit both feet in.
After soaking, remove your feet and scoop some of the sugar mix.
When your feet are completely devoid of any sugar, dry them with the extra towel.

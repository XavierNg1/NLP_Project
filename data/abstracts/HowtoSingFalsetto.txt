Do sirens from the top of your register.
Go into your little boy voice.
Keep it quiet.
Sing on "eee" or "oooh.",
Feel the placement in your sinuses and forehead.
Open up your head.
Pull your falsetto down.
Don't concern yourself with your vibrato for right now.
Understand the physicality of using your falsetto.
Remember to breathe and let go.
Don't be concerned if it sounds weak or airy.
Know that cracking is normal.
Keep your larynx low.
Keep practicing.

Find a pattern for the trousers you'd like to make.
Choose your trouser fabric at a fabric store.
Buy 1.5 feet (1/2 m) of washable lining material, and buy a top stitch color that will either camouflage into the trousers or compliment their color.

,
Practice top stitching with extra material before you start.
Take 6 body measurements either for yourself or the person who will be wearing the trousers, if your pattern requires it.
Cut out the pattern along the dotted guidelines, then put the pattern pieces together to make sure they match before starting to cut your fabric.
Place the pattern pieces on top of the underside of the fabric.
Align the 2 pieces of fabric that will constitute the back of your pants.
Stitch the trousers where the fabric meets with a simple stitch along the outer edge of the fabric.

,
Use an iron to press the seam to 1 side, then do either a double or single top stitch on the outside seams of the pants.

,
Align the 2 pieces of fabric that will be the front of your pants.
Align your pants where the zipper fly will be.
Match your back portion of your pants with the front portion with the underside of the fabric facing out.
Stitch the outside leg seams with a single stitch.
Cut some waist band interfacing to the length of your waist measurement.
Pin the waist band to the trousers.
Stitch the ends together and trim any excess fabric.
Try the pants on to see how far they need to be hemmed.
Attach a button and cut a button hole at the waist band and above the zipper.

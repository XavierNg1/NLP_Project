Pre-heat the oven to 375-degrees F, and line a glass baking dish with butter.
Thaw out a portion of boneless/skinless chicken breasts if necessary, then flatten to 1/4-inch.
Alternatively, use a sharp knife to fillet the breast open, making sure not to cut in half completely.
Lay 1-2 pieces of Swiss cheese and ham inside the flattened chicken.
Roll up the chicken around your ham and cheese.

Place the chicken rolls close together in the glass dish and cook for 45 minutes.

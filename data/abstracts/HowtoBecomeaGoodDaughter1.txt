Talk with your parents.It’s hard to have a good relationship with someone if you don’t communicate with them.
Ask how your parents are doing.
Listen to them.
Tell them you love them.Parents are mind readers and can guess the color of your underwear (your parents probably do your laundry).
Seek your parents’ advice.Talk to them about big decisions and issues in your life.This helps you become a good daughter because you are sharing your life with them.

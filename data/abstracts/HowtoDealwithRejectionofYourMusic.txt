Never show that you are upset, to the person declining your music.
Be gracious.
Keep your rejection to yourself.
Reflect on your music.
Consider a voice teacher.
Never take negative responses as a sign to stop singing, playing or writing music.
Never stop learning about your instrument or your voice.
Don't get discouraged.
Keep working, and keep seeking feedback.

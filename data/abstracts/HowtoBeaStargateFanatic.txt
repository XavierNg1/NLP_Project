Decide in what capacity are you gonna be a fanatic of the Stargate franchise, or in military parlance, becoming either an active or reserve Gater, as what Brad Wright in 2001 would refer to fans of the then Stargate SG-1 television series and the movie that started it all.
If you watched the movie and the subsequent series before, or have not watched them, then do it, even if you are an avid Gater!,
Read the books, for being a true fanatic of the Stargate franchise is having read some of them.
Registering at Gateworld's forum can also bring you closer to the franchise, so join the conversation there.
Use quotes and lines from the franchise in conversations.
Play SG-related games.
Learn the races, the ships, the technologies, both human and alien, and Stargate Command itself.
You can even collect SG-related items and memorabilia and display them in your home.
Attend Stargate Conventions or cons with the SG cast present to know from the cast and crew and to interact with fellow fans.
As support for the franchise skyrocketed in the aftermath of the cancellation of Stargate Universe in 2010 and its final episodes aired the following year, joining Facebook groups and pages supporting for the return of the series and the franchise as a whole and even dedicated SG webpages are a must, especially for active fans of it and newbie fans, and also you can try joining their activities as well so as you can help bring back the beloved and popular sci-fi franchise.

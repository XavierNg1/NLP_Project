A few months before the trip, start planning and researching a destination.
You might want to start an exercise program to get in great shape for a swimsuit.
About a week before you leave, make a list of and gather items you'll need.
Pack plenty of cool, summery clothes, but a few jackets in case the weather turns.
For the car trip, make sure you have enough petrol, and bring plenty of music and activities for kids.
Once you get there, settle in, unpack and have a rest or walk around.
Get a nice early night!,
Hop up early and have breakfast.
As it gets later, go to the beach.
If you don't feel like visiting the beach, you could park yourself at a cafe with a cold drink, socialize (camping grounds are great places to meet new people, or just go people watching), hang out at the mall, go for a walk or bike ride.

,
Visit the tourist centre (if there is one) and see if there are activities you could do, like horse riding, fishing, cruises, visiting a national park, or mountain biking.
Go on a shopping spree.
Pamper yourself.

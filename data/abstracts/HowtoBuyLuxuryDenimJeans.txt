Most of the lines below are sized 24 to 32.
When in doubt about fit or a too long inseam, get a tailor, the results are usually wonderful.

"Stretch Blends" Jeans with stretch will fit more generously, but as higher quality brands use stronger types of stretch the give will not be as great as the lower end 'shopping mall stretch' jeans (which should be avoided by anyone over 12.),
If you favor jeans with stretch be sure to buy a few high quality pairs, size down and rotate wearing them so they retain their stretch.

"True to size" What does it mean?,
Jeans that "run small"Â : This set of jeans are running small mainly through the hips and thighs but may still work well if you are curvy depending on how you are built.
Jeans that run really small: These lines (size 30) equivalent to a dress size 7/8 and will fit most comfortably on the very slim and tall or petite and tiny boned.
Higher Waisted Styles: After rises became dangerously low, many higher end denim lines returned to a high waisted jean.
Skinny Jeans: Many luxury denim lines now make skinny jeans that taper and fit like leggings.
As with all jeans lines you will find exceptions to the rule.

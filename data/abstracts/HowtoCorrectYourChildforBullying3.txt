Don’t label your child as a bully.It is important that you recognize your child is engaged in bullying behavior.
Use positive reinforcement.When your child acts in a way that is the opposite of how a bully acts, offer verbal praise and encouragement.
Insist that your child apologize to their victim.If your child has bullied someone else, it is important to make them take responsibility for their actions.
Get help from teachers.Much bullying takes place inside the classroom or halls of school.
Talk to other community members.Many people can help you monitor and remedy your child’s bullying.
Be patient.

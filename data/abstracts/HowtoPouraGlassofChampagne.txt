Chill the champagne bottle for a couple of hours.
Check that the glass (or crystal) is clean.
Wrap the bottle with a napkin or tea towel.
Open the bottle by removing the foil then the wire cage around the foil.
Place the glass on a table, or ask someone to hold it for you.
Place your right hand at the base of the bottle with your thumb placed into the depression on the bottom (called the punt) and balance the front of the neck on the side of the glass, supported by your left hand.
Try to tilt the glass to its side (if you can).
Wait till the bubbles subside and then continue pouring to fill the glass.

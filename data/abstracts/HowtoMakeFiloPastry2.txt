Set the bowl out for 30-60 minutes to return to room temperature before shaping.
Cut the dough into 8-10 equal pieces.
Lay a piece of dough out on a lightly floured surface.
Roll the dough out as thin as you can with a rolling pin.
Grab your wooden dowel and slowly begin wrapping the sheet of dough around it.
Roll the dowel over the dough pressing down and out to spread it thin.
Unroll the dough from the dowel carefully.
Pinch together any rips, or cut off any excess dough and use it to patch up holes.
Place finished dough on parchment paper, then brush liberally with olive oil.

Ensure that all the granite edges are smooth and straight and line up properly before you seam granite.
Apply masking tape along the edges of the two pieces that you’re seaming.
Add tint to clear, knife-grade, two-part epoxy to approximate the color of your granite.
Attach one or two soft rubber suction cups on either side of the seam you are joining and attach turnbuckles between the suction cups.
Mix the hardener into your tinted epoxy.








,
Butter the edges of your granite with your activated epoxy.








,
Tighten the turnbuckles to squeeze the two pieces of granite together.
Pull a wet razor blade or putty knife along the edge of the epoxy to remove excess and to create a smooth seam that’s flush with the surface.








,
Wait for the epoxy to dry and remove the tape and suction cups.








,
Polish the countertop and seal for best results.

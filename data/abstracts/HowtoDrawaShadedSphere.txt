Draw a hollow circle with a light line.
Choose a light source for this sphere.
Begin shading.
As you move towards the light source, fill the circle with less and less pressure, heavier on the dark area, lighter on the light area.
Use your finger or a tortillon to blend the shading and add a shadow.

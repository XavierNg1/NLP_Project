Pre-planning requirements: Take a photography class at the local college or an on-line course.
Pack a travel photography bag: Here you will store your camera and accessories, such as a field tri-pod for keeping your camera steady.
Service your equipment: Take good care of your equipment and service it so that you know it is working at peak performance.
Practice camera and photography skills: Prior to the day of your departure, study your equipment backwards and forwards, inside and out.
Lighting is so important to master: Either by way of timing the rhythm of natural lights, or by way of artificial lighting sources you'll have the ability to capture your subjects mood and temperament.
Choose subject matter carefully: Know your "center of interest," it is usually here within the photograph that draws in the eye.

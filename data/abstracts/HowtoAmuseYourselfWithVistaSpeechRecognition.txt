If you haven't already set up speech recognition, do so now.
Say: "Start listening.
Make random noises like laughing (lots of laughing- it should be the majority of the noise you make anyway), moaning, "ppppbbbhhhhhhttt"-ing, burping, and saying random words (only occasionally- swear words work well for this) into the microphone.

,
Every so often give it some time to catch up.
When you have enough to amuse yourself (maybe one or two paragraphs), say "stop listening" and close speech recognition.
Open sound recorder and start recording- *read back* the text that speech recognition has left you, and laugh if you have to.
Listen to yourself reading the random, epic story.
Repeat if you want.

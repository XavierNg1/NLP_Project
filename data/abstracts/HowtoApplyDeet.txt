Choose a DEET product that is appropriate for your outdoor activity and age.
Using DEET products simultaneously with sunscreen has been shown to reduce the effectiveness of sunscreen by as much as one-third the SPF.
Pour liquid DEET-based insect repellents onto your hands and spread evenly over exposed skin.
Watch insect activity around you to know when to apply DEET to yourself again.
Reapply your DEET-based product as needed.
Wash and remove the DEET-based product you previously applied after your outdoor activity is finished.

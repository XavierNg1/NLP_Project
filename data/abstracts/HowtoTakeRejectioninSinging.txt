Be ready for negative comments.
Learn to stop caring about what other people think.
Decide how you want to sing and where your singing strengths lie.
Realize that others have put up with rejection too and often years of it.
Keep your head up.
Hang out with the crowds who care for the music you like.
Be yourself, anywhere and everywhere.

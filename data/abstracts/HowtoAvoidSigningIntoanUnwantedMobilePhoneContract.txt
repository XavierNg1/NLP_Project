Determine whether or not you really need a phone plan / sign a contract.
Figure out what you want to use your phone for?,
Do your research.
At the same time, research the handset (phone) you want to get.
Once you decided on the plan and phone you want, read all the fine print.
Go to the store where you will be buying your mobile phone.
Once you arrive, approach one of the salespeople.
Next, show them the phone you wanted to get with it.
When you receive the contract, read through it as best you can.
Before you are set on you way, the salesperson will have to activate the phone for you, usually with a SIM card.
As they are finishing up on the sale, the salesperson may try to sell you additional plan features or a warranty plan.
This is also your final opportunity for any questions you might have.
When you get home, run a check of your phone.
If you're good to go, enjoy your new phone.

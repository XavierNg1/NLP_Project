Draw a box in the top left corner of your paper, which should lay horizontally.
Leave 1 inch of space to the right of the box, and then drawn an identical box in the middle of the page (3 inches square).
Measure another inch to the right of the middle box, and complete the top row by drawing a third box of identical dimensions (3 inches square).
Draw arrows to the right in the 1 inch spaces between the boxes, aiming from left to right.
Number the left box “1,” the middle box “2,” and the far right box “3.” Keep the numbers small, as you will write other information in these boxes.
Move to the bottom of the page and repeat drawing three 3” x 3” boxes along the bottom of the page with 1-inch gaps in between them.
Draw arrows to the left between the boxes, going from right to left.
Number the right box “4,” the middle box “5,” and the left box “6.” Remember to keep the numbers small so that you leave room to write in the boxes.
Draw an arrow vertically downward from box 3 to box 4.
Fill the boxes with information pertaining to a sequence of events or timeline.

Check your chosen vine that you want to cut and see if it is healthy.
Cut off a piece of vine that's at least 6 inches long, has at least 5 healthy leaves, and has nodes.
Remove two of the closest leaves to the bottom node.
Place your cut vine in a jar or container of clean water, only filling the water up to where it covers the bottom one or two nodes.
Put in a place where there is indirect sunlight, and wait.
Use potting material that is mostly peat and drains well.Whether your plant is growing outside or indoors in a pot, make sure there is at least six inches of soil-depth in which to grow.
With your finger, make a hole that will cover the cutting up to half an inch above its roots.
Water the plant by sprinkling onto the dirt.
Let the plant grow!,
Water moderately when the soil begins getting dry, not really dry.

,
Get a nice ceramic jar, flower vase, or container that is not taller than the cutting.
Using pebbles or marbles, fill the container about 75% of the way up.
Make a "hole" through the substrate and place the cutting in it.
Fill the container with water.
Let it grow!

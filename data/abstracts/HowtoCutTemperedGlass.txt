Understand the annealing process.
Begin the annealing process.
Cool down the glass slowly to where it is below the strain point temperature (Î· = 1014.5 Poise).
Prepare and cut the annealed glass after you put on your safety goggles.
Put your 1/4-inch (0.6 cm) wooden dowel directly under the line you just cut, and apply sharp, sudden pressure on both sides of the dowel.
Sand the edge of the freshly cut glass with a whetstone.
Re-temper the glass, if desired.

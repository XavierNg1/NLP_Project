Watch horror movies for inspiration.
Choose your timing and audience carefully.
Choose your chair wisely.
Prepare yourself.
Decide how you will act that night.
Start the prank.
Sit in the chair.
Stare at a point on the ceiling.
Begin making sounds.
Know how youâ€™ll react to your friends.
Come clean.

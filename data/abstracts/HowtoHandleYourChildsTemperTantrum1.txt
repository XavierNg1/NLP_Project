Remain calm enough to handle the tantrum properly.
Make sure the child has what he or she needs.
Ask what’s wrong.
Give clear explanations instead of just saying “no.” Many parents just say “no” and “because I said so” instead of explaining the reason why, but that’s frustrating for kids.
Offer your child a choice of coping strategies.
Hold your ground.
Take steps to prevent injury.
Don’t lose your own temper.
Help your child feel loved no matter what.

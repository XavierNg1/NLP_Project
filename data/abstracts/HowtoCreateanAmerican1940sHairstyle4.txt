Brush your hair thoroughly.
Hold a 4-inch section of hair straight up above your scalp.
Continue holding the designated section of hair straight up and firmly swipe it with a fine-toothed comb or bristled brush, starting at the top by your fingers and moving down toward the roots.
Repeat Step 3 until all of the 4-inch section you were holding is ratted.
Manipulate the ratted hair based on your desired style.

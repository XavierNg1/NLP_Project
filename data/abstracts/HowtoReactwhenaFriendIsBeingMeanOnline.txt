Don't freak out; stay calm.
Decide if it is serious.
Assess.
If you suspect that the person talking to you is an impostor, politely ask the following questions:


Why are you acting like this?,
Think over your actions in the past.
Think of how it could have happened.
If you really do think this is not your friend, then ask a security question.

Park the car on top of a large tarp or drop cloth to contain the old paint.
Use masking tape to cover the areas of the car that won't be sanded.
Place a disk of 80-grit sandpaper onto a dual-action sander.
Sand the top of the car, beginning at the roof and moving to the hood, fenders, doors, trunk, and rear fenders.
Work the sander against the car, and work on 1 panel at a time until the bare metal is showing.
Remove the sander from the air compressor, and use the open end of the air compressor hose to blow the dust off of the car.

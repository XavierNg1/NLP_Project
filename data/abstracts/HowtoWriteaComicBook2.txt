Use a mock-up to test out your ideas, style, layout and pacing without sinking too much work into the idea.
Create several timelines: one for what should be shown to the reader in the story, what action needs to occur, where character development will go, etc.
Divide a blank page into panels for your story.
Using your timelines as a guide, fill in the panels with either descriptions or sketches of what action should be seen, and what dialogue should be heard.
Keep your script page and graphic page side by side as you work.
Hire an artist, or finish the work yourself, once you're happy with the mock-up.

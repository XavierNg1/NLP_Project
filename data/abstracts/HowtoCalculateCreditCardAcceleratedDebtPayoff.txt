Create a realistic budget.

Stop using your credit cards.
Make a list of your credit card debt.
Organize the credit card list with the lowest balance first and highest balance last.
Pay the minimum payment on each credit card except the card listed first.
Pay the minimum payment plus the extra amount from your budget on the card listed first.
Continue paying with this method until Credit Card B is paid in full.
Begin paying the amount you were sending to the first credit card on the next credit card on your list plus the minimum payment.

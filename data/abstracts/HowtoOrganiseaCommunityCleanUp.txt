Assess the possibilities: is there a lot of small-scale litter around that needs clearing to make your neighbourhood (school campus or whatever) look just that bit better and smarter?,
Work with a community group (such as Neighbourhood Watch, residents' association, etc.),
Agree a date and time.
Purchase needed equipment, if funds are available (you can ask for contributions if necessary) buy heavy-duty rubberizedÂ  gloves, rubbish bags and rent a skip/dumpster that can be sited in or near the site you intend to clean up.
Arrange a reward for volunteers -- have non-pickers-up bring drinks and snacks, cakes, etc. to hand out to pickers-up at the end of the cleaning session.

Start by sketching an object.
Scan your drawing and place it on your artboard (or document).
Drag your gradient box toward your artwork.
After selecting your colors, it's time to add them to the drawing.
Next is to apply a gradient on the center of the sunflower.
Then next is to apply a gradient to the first half of the sunflower’s leaf.
For the second half of the leaf, just select the second half and click the gradient fill.
Apply a gradient to the sunflower’s water drops.
For a water drop glisten effect, scale the drops to a size of 70 percent.
For the final touches on the sunflower, change the stroke weight to something finer such as a weight of 1 to 0.5 pt.
You now have an artwork where you were able to apply different techniques on how to use the gradient tool.

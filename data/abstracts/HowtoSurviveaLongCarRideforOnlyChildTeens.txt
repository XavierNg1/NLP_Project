Start packing the day before the trip.
Be creative with games.
Bring books you love, or ones that you need to read for school.
Make sure that you charge everything before you leave!,
Wear comfortable clothes and go barefoot.
Bring a blanket and a pillow or two, and use those and the luggage to make a sort of nest in the back seat.
Stay up packing and then get up early to leave, so you can sleep in the car.

Schedule stops about every 60-90 minutes to avoid total insanity and/or bladder rupture.

Pack a lunch box or small cooler with snacks, juice boxes, Capri Suns, bottled water, etc.

Do the same for the drive home.

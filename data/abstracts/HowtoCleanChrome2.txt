Choose a cleaning solution.Because chrome is a relatively soft metal, appropriately lightweight cleaning solutions are the best choice for it.
Use your lightest available cleaner first.If you have a variety of cleaners to choose from, pick the lightest solution first.
Apply your cleaner to a towel.
Rub the chrome gently in circles.Once the cleaner is on your towel, apply it to the chrome surface in a gentle smooth and circular motion.
Rinse and dry the chrome once you're finished cleaning it.After using a cleaner, give the chrome a quick once-over with a towel damp with hot water to remove any cleaner.

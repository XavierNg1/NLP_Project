Find a niche that is hungry for information - Information marketing works best when you pick a niche where people are looking for information, and not a specific product.
Solve a problem for that niche - Your information product must solve a problem for the niche.
Write a product or have one written - Fortunately, you don’t have to be a Pulitzer-prize winning journalist in order to write a profitable information product.
Create a sales page for your product - After you’ve written your product or had it written, you need a page to act as your 24 hours sales person.
Market your product - Your information marketing business won’t go anywhere without any sales.
Summary - Information marketing is a great way to start a business online because you are giving people exactly what they need.

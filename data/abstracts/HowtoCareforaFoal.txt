Make sure that the paddock is safe for a newborn.
Make sure there is a shelter from prevailing weather.
The area should be big enough that the foal can run and play as this helps the foal increase its muscles and allows it to find their legs.
Now, on that note, make sure you have a small paddock that you have access to, in case you need to treat the mare or foal.
The fence should be high enough that the mare can not jump the fence, foals and weanlings often jump fences to be with other horses, so it needs to be at least 150 centimeter (59.1Â in) tall or 1 and a half meters.

,
Make sure the feed troughs are safe and have no sharp or pointy bits.
Water should also be available.
Okay, now that the area is suitable, you can begin to care for the foal.

,
When feeding the mare and foal.
Okay, they are the basic feeds, you can also buy pre-mixed mare and foal feeds, which are excellent, depending of you wish to mix your own or to simple scoop and feed.

,
When feeding, provide the mare and foal with enough to fill 2 small buckets.
By using a dollop of molasses, you encourage the foal to nibble at the feed.
We all know the saying "What goes up must come down", well, in horses, "What goes in comes back out" Grown horses usually defecate about 12 times a day, depending on climate, feed and workload.
Now, you're probably thinking, if I worm the mare, the worms will be gone?,
You are now set to care for a foal.
Also, make sure you remove any obstacles such as rugs, (on or off horse) as the foal may become entangled.
Many people throw a ball or something for the foal to play with, this is good, as the foal will be less likely to crib or windsuck, even at this young age.

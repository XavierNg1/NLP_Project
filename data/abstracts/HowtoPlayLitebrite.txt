If using a brand new kit, take proper measures to assemble it well.
If using a template, take one of the outlined pictures and slide it onto the board from the top.
Poke pegs through depending on the letters representing different colors.
When taking out the pegs, take out the ones on the corners first so it will be easier.
Slide the picture out carefully.Slide in another picture and repeat the process above of poking pegs in to create a picture.
To make the picture light up, screw out the screw on the battery container, and put a battery in.
Store pegs in the empty container at the bottom of the board when you are done.

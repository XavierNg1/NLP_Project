Plan before you go.
Hit grocery stores along your route.
If you have a larger budget,stop at a local restaurant.
Be careful about drinking water in a different area.
If you are in a real hurry or very very broke, you can sleep in your car at rest stops or rural pull offs, or maybe splurge on a campground.
If you have more time and a bigger budget, you can choose a motel.
Don't forget camping!,
Call your home safety person at your scheduled check-in time.
Plan ahead and watch your gas so you don't get caught off guard with the "last chance for gas" situations and end up stranded, out of fuel, in the middle of nowhere.

To prevent cramping, soreness, and thrombosis, stop the car approximately every 45 minutes (you can set a timer if you have trouble remembering) to 1 hour at most and have everyone get out and walk (nothing extreme, just a stroll to have a chance to stretch the legs, work the muscles and get the blood circulating) for approx 5-10 minutes.
Enjoy your drive.

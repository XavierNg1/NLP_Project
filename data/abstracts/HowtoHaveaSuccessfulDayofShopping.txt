Before you venture into a shopping center, make a list with two categories: Things you need and things you want.
Put yourself in a good mood.
Do some preliminary research.
Budget.
Pack a bag or purse the night before that include your list, a map, a water bottle, some snacks, some emergency cash, a credit card and ATM card, a cell phone or coins for a pay phone or a phone card, and a positive attitude!,
Plot out your plan of action on the map.
Try everything on.
If you are purchasing many items, inquire ahead of time about locker rentals at the mall.
Reward yourself with an ice-cold beverage or a snack from the food court at the end.

Choose socks that absorb sweat.Because the likelihood of developing a fungal infection relates to the degree of moisture (fungi thrive in moist environments), choosing socks that are made of a material that does not absorb the moisture of sweat can be a very helpful preventative step.
Consider your choice of footwear.In addition to thriving in moist environments, fungi also thrive in confined spaces.
Do not walk barefoot in public places.While wearing confining shoes for a long period of time can be a risk factor for fungal infections, so, too, can walking barefoot in public places where fungi may be present.
Wear rubber gloves to keep moisture off your hands.For tasks such as cleaning or washing dishes, where your fingernails may be exposed to dirt and moisture, one option is to wear rubber gloves.
Understand why fungal infections are more common on the toenails than on the fingernails.While it is possible to develop a fungal infection on your toenails as well as your fingernails, the toenails are far more common.

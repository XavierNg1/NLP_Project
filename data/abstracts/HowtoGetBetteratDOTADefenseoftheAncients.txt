Do play.
Do try to make dota-playing friends online (or in real life, if you can), who are preferably as good as you or better.
Do read guides.
Don't be hostile to other players, be friendly to them... someday they can help you.
Learn how to juke.
Always last hit or deny if you can.
Do not limit your denying to just creeps.
Play some more.
Map awareness and map control is the key.

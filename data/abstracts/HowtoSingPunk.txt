Keep it as natural as possible.
Listen to the greats.
Yell.
Find your head voice.
Sing through a sneer.
Take care of your voice.
Watch the masters.
Learn to handle the mic.
Distort the mic.
Move around.
Get down into the crowd.
Look like your audience.
Write the truth.
Make the personal political.
Write simple melodies.
Make the songs short.
Be crude.

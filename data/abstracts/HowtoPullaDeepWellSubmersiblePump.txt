Turn off power to the pump.
Mount a hand-crank winch in such a way as to lift the pump out partway.
Hook the winch to the flange that connects flexible pipe to the storage or pressure tank.

,
Winch the pump so that there's a few feet of the flexible pipe outside the casing.

,
Put two pieces of two-by-six, with a piece of cardboard sandwiched between, together with C-clamps.
Using bolts through the holes, tighten the clamp onto the flexible pipe just above the casing pipe.

,
Unhook the winch cable from the pump flange.
,
From here you can finish the job in one of several ways:

The relay method:
Make another clamp the same as above, but drill two more holes in each clamp, put a loop of rope through the two holes, and tie a figure-eight knot in each end.
Stuff something into the pipe to prevent dust and contaminants from entering your well and the groundwater; you'll see the old (cleaned) blanket that was used in the photo at top.

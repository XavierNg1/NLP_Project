Understand what the gradient is.
Take the partial derivatives of the function with respect to each of the variables.
Define function:


f(x,y,z)=5xy2+2x3z2+6y{\displaystyle f(x,y,z)=5xy^{2}+2x^{3}z^{2}+6y}


,
Calculate partial derivatives.
The partial derivatives are the components of the gradient.

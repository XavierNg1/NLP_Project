Part your hair off to the side.
Gather a small chunk of hair right next to the side part and your hairline.
Divide the chunk into three even sections.
Begin with a standard braid.
Add a thin strand of hair to the section closest to your hairline.
Cross the hairline section over the middle section.
Add a thin strand of hair to the section closest to your side part.
Cross the side part section over the new middle section.
Continue adding strands and crossing over sections.
Consider how you want to end the braid.
Stop braiding when you are 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the nape of your neck.
Consider adding a decorations to the end of your braid after you tie it off.

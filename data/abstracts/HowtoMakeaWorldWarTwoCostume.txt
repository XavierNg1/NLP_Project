Think of what you want your soldier to be.
Research military uniforms in history books, online, or by watching vintage newsreel footage on the History Channel or the Military Channel Before you can start building your outfit you need the basic clothing.
Start out looking at military surplus stores to see what kind of things you can find.
Find a helmet.
Search online specialty shops to look for reproduction items if you cannot find authentic ones repro is better because original will ruin too easily and you will have to keep buying thread for it every time.Beware if you shop at online auctions, both because authentic uniform items are serious collector's items and can command a very high price, and because reproduction items may be misrepresented as genuine vintage, you will need to be careful if purchasing there.
Assemble what you have bought into however you like it but is better to follow regs to make it more authentic.remember and always keep in mind if you can't find good things online then print a photo of a uniform and go to walmart or sears and find as close as possible to what's in the photo and try your best to find a good army surplus store near you.

Flip to the back of a sterile petri dish containing agar.
Draw another line starting from the left side of the back plate until you hit the other side.
Label the back plate of the petri dish with relevant laboratory information such as your initials, date, time and culture source.





,Begin by connecting the Bunsen burner to a fuel source and igniting it.
Insert the loop into the flame at a vertical angle.
Remove the loop from the flame.
Cool the inoculating loop.
Remove the inoculation loop from the petri dish.
Hold the sterile inoculation loop.
Insert the loop into the culture, swirling the contents to insure even distribution of bacteria within.Remove the loop and recover the original sample.
Lift the lid of the petri dish just enough to insert the loop.
Re-sterilize the inoculation loop now that the first sector of the “T” has been inoculated.Rotate the petri dish 90 degrees and lift the lid just enough to insert the loop.
Start in the first sector.
Continue into the second sector.
Re-sterilize the inoculation loop now that the second sector of the “T” has been inoculated.Rotate the petri dish 90 degrees and lift the lid just enough to insert the loop.
Start in the second sector.
Continue into the third sector.

Find your cement source.

Find large rocks to make a kiln with, and wood to make a fire with.

Build a kiln.

Fill a metal container such as a bucket with your shells or other cement items.

Heat your shells or other cement items (see step 1) for 4-7 hours, or until they start to become brittle and start to crumble in to sand like dust.
Wait for the cement to cool before using.

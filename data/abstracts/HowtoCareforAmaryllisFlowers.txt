Purchase Amaryllis bulbs in the color of your choice.
Store the bulbs in a cool, dry and well-ventilated place until they are ready to be planted.
Decide if you want your amaryllis to bloom in the winter or the summer.
Plant the bulb in rich soil outside or in compost soil inside approximately 8 weeks before you want it to flower.

,
Choose a container that is well drained.
Pick a container that is half as wide as the bulb on each side.
Soak the amaryllis bulb in lukewarm water for 2 hours before you intend to plant it.

,
Buy rich potting compost at a local garden store.
Place the amaryllis bulb in the pot with the roots down.
Place the pot in direct sunlight for the first few weeks of care.
Water the bulb very sparingly until it reaches 2 inches (5 cm) of new growth.

,
Turn the base of the pot every week to encourage straight stalk growth.
Move the pot to indirect sunlight when it starts to bloom.
Water the amaryllis flower regularly, as you would most house plants.
Cut the flowers off 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bulb when they start to die.
Start to water the plant less as you get close to removing the bulb.

,
Make sure you remove and store the bulbs before the first frost, and before temperatures reach 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius).

,
Cut the leaves back to 2 inches above the bulb.When they start to yellow because of cooler temperatures and less water, they are ready to cut.
Remove the bulb and roots from the soil.
Clean the bulb with water.

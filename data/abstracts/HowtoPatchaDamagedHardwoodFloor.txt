Determine the size of the pieces you need to replace.
Visit a lumberyard, home-improvement store, floor-covering store or mill workshop.
Research a stain color that will match your floor, at a home improvement store.
Bore a hole through each end of the damaged board that is about 1 inch (2.54 cm) in diameter, using a sharp spade bit on your drill.
Using a straight edge, draw lines connecting the right edges of the holes and then connecting the left edges.
Take your circular saw and adjust the blade so that the depth of the cut you will make will be equal to the thickness measurement of the boards.
Remove the blade guard, place the nose of the saw down at the top edge of the line.
Use your hammer and chisel to pry out the middle section.
Trim a new board using a saw.
Use a urethane adhesive on the tongue of the new board and on the tongue and groove of the surrounding boards.
Stain the replacement board until it matches the surrounding boards.

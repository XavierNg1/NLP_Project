To start the whole setup, begin with a wall plug, easily reachable, connected to the mains of your house.
Open eyebolts is the simplest way to lay a line and help solve the flex tangle in such cramped space.
.ON THE RIGHT a single round wall outlet ( orange) gives power to a 3-socket power strip,(always on) that holds the modem, that can be switched on/off ( see its own switch/pilot light) and the wireless headphones adapter which is permanently on.
Finished.

Procure aircraft cable and specialty hardware.
Make a loop on each end of each cable using the cable clamps.
Drill a Â¼ inch (6.35mm) hole through one end of each tube, about 2 inches (5cm) from the end.
Screw 6-inch (15cm) or longer lag bolts into the ground about 8 to 12 feet apart (points C and D in the drawing).
Screw in one of the 10-inch lag bolts at point A in the drawing.
Removing the nuts from one of the cable clamps, make a loop at about the midpoint of the first aircraft cable, just big enough to fit over the pole.
Screw in a 10-inch (25cm) lag bolt at point B, securing the first pole.
Repeat the previous three steps for points D, E, and F, using the second piece of aircraft cable.

,
Mount your hammock, using two half hitches at point C, and a taut-line hitch at point D. Slide the hitch until the hammock rope is very tight.

,
Sit in the middle of the hammock, and make sure your bottom doesn't hit the ground.
With the working end of the taut-line hitch, tie another two (or more) half hitches around the cable, in case the wind lifts the hammock off the poles while you're not in it.
Enjoy sleeping in your hammock as long as you stay in this location.

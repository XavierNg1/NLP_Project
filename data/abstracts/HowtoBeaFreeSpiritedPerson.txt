Decide if you want to be a free spirit.
Be prepared to be unique.A free spirit is a non-conformist, who isn’t afraid to think for his or herself, and who follows his or her passions.
Get in touch with your creative side.
Give yourself time to be spontaneous.Strange as it may sound, you may need to give yourself time to be spontaneous.
Open your mind to spontaneity.A spontaneous and free spirit will look at the world with a child’s eyes, thinking about how much one doesn’t know, exploring whatever seems interesting, and always asking “why?” and “how?” Give yourself the chance to open up and try new things before making judgments about them.

Take advantage of opportunities to be spontaneous.
Let it go.A free spirit is not tied to many things beyond his or her ideals, and people he or she cares about.
Consider downsizing your home or moving.A home that is larger or more complex than you need, filled with more material things than you need, costs too much, or is in a location you don’t want to be in can keep you from being a free spirit.
Be less materialistic.No one can get through life without some material things.
Decide what to get rid of.Decluttering your life is one of the first steps you can take toward becoming a more free spirited person.
Try some breathing exercises.
Practice mindfulness.Mindfulness is a practice that helps people become more aware of their thoughts and feelings, and of how they relate to the world around them in the present moment.
Try yoga.
Let go of mental hang-ups.

Put your empty weapon in the holster.
Put on the holster so your weapon is under your arm.
Ensure that the point where the straps cross in back is centered high on your back, just below the back of your shirt collar.
Adjust the holster the straps.
Check to see if your magazine carrier is under your right arm (left arm for left-handed shooters) and that you can easily unsnap it and remove the magazines.
Attach the tie-downs to your belt, if you usually wear a belt.
Put on a jacket and practice drawing your weapon and removing your magazines.
Consider cutting the strap ends after the final adjustment if they are long enough to get in the way when you're drawing your weapon.

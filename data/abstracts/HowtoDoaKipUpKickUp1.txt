Lie flat on your back.
Pull your legs up to your chest.
Put your hands flat on the ground, next to your ears.
Roll back so that all of your weight is on your shoulders.
Kick your legs up directly into the air.
Push hard with your hands as soon as you feel your momentum shifting upwards.
Land in a squat.

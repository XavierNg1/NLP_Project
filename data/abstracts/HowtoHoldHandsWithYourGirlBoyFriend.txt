Put your hand near his/hers.
Move your hand even closer, and soon, very slowly put your hand in his/hers.
If your boyfriend or girlfriend seems to be enjoying himself/herself, holding hands with you, this is good.
Congrats!,
Move on to hugs, more touching, and maybe a little kissing!,
Don't feel embarrassed!

Firstly, lay out all the equipment you are going to use-whatever pattern it is.
Start with your rucksack, this is the biggest piece of your personal kit so needs the most camouflage.
Next, move on to the helmet.
Be careful with webbing.
Be extremely cautious when disguising your weapon.
Vehicles really need a vehicle camouflage net.

Make a point of making your health and fitness workout part of your regular daily schedule.
Plan the best time of day for you to exercise when you are not going to be fighting everybody else for the equipment.
Start at a level that is comfortable to you and do not exercise at a level that is too much for you.
Set goals that you can meet, and when you achieve them, set more for the next week.
Keep a health and fitness diary so you can see the progress you are making.
Vary your exercises.
Invite a friend or colleague to come to the gym with you.
Consider working with a Personal Trainer at your gym.
Force yourself to go to the gym religiously the first three months of your health and fitness programme.
If you miss your workout, find a way to get yourself back into the groove as soon as possible.

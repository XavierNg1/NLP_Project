Gather your supplies: A canopy is a great way to add privacy or a dreamy effect to your bed.
Consider painting your embroidery hoop.
Take apart the embroidery hoop if you have not already done so.
Slide both curtains onto the open outer hoop.
Tie three pieces of ribbon to the inner hoop.
Tie the top ends of the three ribbons together in a tight knot.
Slip the inner hoop inside the outer hoop.
Close the outer hoop.
Drill a hole into the ceiling and insert the hook.
Hang the canopy from the hook and drape the curtains around your bed.

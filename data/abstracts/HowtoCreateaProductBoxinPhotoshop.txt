Start Photoshop and create a new document by typing CTRL+N.
Add the front and side of the Box.
Align the front and side.
Distort the front and side.
Move the box.
Add a box shadow to the document.
Click Image>Adjustments>Hue/Saturation.
Make some minor adjustments to the box, so that it doesn't show a shadow, because our box has a shadow, and the shadow on the box, just doesn't look right.
Fix the fact that the document is much bigger than the box.
Look at and use your finished product.

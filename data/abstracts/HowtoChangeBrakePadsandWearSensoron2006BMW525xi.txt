Obtain necessary parts (pads, rotors--whichever is being replaced) from auto parts store.Jack up front or rear, CHOCK wheels, and place jack stands for safety.Remove wheel.
Look at the caliper (part that sits on edge of rotor, presses the brake pads against rotor).
On the BACK side of the caliper there are two Torx bolts under black plastic caps about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) round.
The brake pads may need to be pushed out from the rotor slightly to make removing the caliper easier (especially if there is a noticeable lip formed on the outermost circumference of your rotor).
The caliper can now slide off of the rotor.
Use a G clamp or brake piston pushing tool to force the piston as far back as it will go, using the old pad to push against.
Take the old pads out and replace with the new ones.Replace the calipers and tighten the Torx bolts back down.
This is a good time to check and possibly rotate the tires.Reset Service Interval Reminder (see How to Reset Service Interval Reminder for 2006 BMW 525xi).

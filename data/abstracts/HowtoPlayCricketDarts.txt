Understand the dartboard.
Find a friend (or friends) to play with.
Set up the scoreboard.
Familiarize yourself with the rules of the game:


The winner is the first player to 'close out' all of the required numbers (15â€“20, plus the bullseye) while scoring equal or more points than their opponent.
Begin playing.
Keep score.
Put a line through a number once both players have closed it out, indicating that it is no longer eligible for points.
If the first person/team to close everything out also has equal or more points than their opponent, the game is over.

Spend less time on IM.
Paint your nails.
Talk with a lot of other people.
Listen to music you enjoy.
Plan your reply.
Let him start the conversation with you.
Play a game.
Get an egg timer and set it to ten or twenty seconds, whatever feels right, and set it ticking if he says something, and forbid yourself from answering until it pings.

,
End the conversation yourself.

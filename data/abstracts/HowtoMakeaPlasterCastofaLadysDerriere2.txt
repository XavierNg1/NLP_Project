Cover the skin you plan to cast with a thick layer of petroleum jelly or olive oil.Allow the model to apply the lubricant between her legs and anywhere else she might not feel comfortable with you touching.It is important to have a barrier between the skin and the bandages, as this will keep hair and skin from sticking to the plaster, making it painful to remove.
Position your model on the table and provide adequate support.If the pose requires her to prop herself up on her elbows, put pillows underneath her chest so she has some support.
Dip the bandages in a large bowl of warm water, one at a time.
Start from the thighs and begin laying strips down one at a time, overlapping and working your way up the body.You must work as quickly and efficiently as possible, as the plaster becomes stiff in under 10 minutes and new strips will no longer adhere to the dried bandages.Lay down your strips in different directions, either alternating between horizontal and vertical, or in criss-crossing diagonals.
Layer the bandages as you go.
Allow the plaster to harden.
Loosen the edges of the dried cast, then gently lift it off the model's body.
Let the cast continue to dry.

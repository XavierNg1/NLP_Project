Avoid plants that are at high risk of catching alight.
Prefer plants that have a slower reaction to flames and are less likely to ignite.
Situate the barbecue well away from plant life as much as possible.
Avoid having any plant materials hanging near or over a barbecue, whatever species of plants you choose to have around the barbecue.

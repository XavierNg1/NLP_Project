Practice with a singer on piano -- much as it is often done on guitar like strumming.
Play non-obnoxiously (not too loudly) as the basic technique.
Break up the chords (arpeggio like strumming, harping) so that it is not like "clump, clump..." and lighten up as a piano accompanist, and even just use one hand to play the rhythm -- explained in more detail below.
Use one hand to accompany on the piano.
Practice rolling the notes by rocking or swaying your hand and fingers: going through each chord to play the notes separately.
Think of a mental picture of the fingers as forming the same "shape" of


each three note chord like a 3 pronged fork or tripod and
a four note chord (7th) as a four pronged fork.

,
Experiment playing "near" middle C, and down an octave (or maybe up) from there to fit your chording to the singer(s).

,
Learn to get the chord from the key signatures.
Write the chord changes above the words on a written or printed page like it is done for guitar.
Interpret various piano styles by ear, and so you change tempo and the chord like for changing the key up or down as necessary.
Leave the melody for the singer to do, and so you chord cleverly and rhythmically during the vocals (something like strumming, playing rhythm).
Play bass notes with your left hand.

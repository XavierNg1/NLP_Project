Open a new Excel Workbook and create 2 worksheets, Data and Saves.
Create the Data worksheet Column Headings:


In cell A1, enter p = x
In cell B1, enter D of p  = y (i.e.
Given the Demand Function D(p) = 975 - 39p, find the price that maximizes revenue by finding the price at which demand is unit elastic.
Create the Chart Data:


Edit Go To cell range A2:A27 and enter to A2 5 and Edit Fill Series Column Linear Step Value .5, OK. Insert Name Define Name p for column A.
Edit Go To cell range B2:B27 and enter the formula w/o quotes "=975-39*p" and Edit Fill Down.
Create the Chart:


Select cell range A2:C27 and using the Chart Wizard or Chart on the Ribbon, select Charts, All/Other, Scatter, Smooth Line Scatter.
Interpret the chart as follows:


Find 1 on the left vertical where the Elasticity Function E(p) scale is and read to the right until you find where 1 is on the E(p) curve.

Practice with some example problems: Find the price at which demand is unit elastic for:


D(p) = 60e^-.1p where D'(p) = -6e^-.1p  .

There are many inversions of these chords throughout the song.
Keeping the inversion of the chord above, move the finger that is on G to F and the finger that was on E flat; to D flat;.
Yet again, keep the chord that you played above.
For each chord the note that is furthest to the right will be 1, the note furthest to the left is 3, and the note in the middle of notes 1 and 3 is 2.
Go to the next chord, B flat; minor, and play the pattern 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2.
Play the next chord, F minor, the same as you played the first chord with the pattern 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2.

This whole pattern of all three chords is played throughout most of the song in the right hand.
Your left hand will then go to octaves with a pattern of your pinky playing on 1 and your thumb on 2 and 3 going with the patterns of your right hand.
For the chorus of the song you will continue your left hand pattern.
Near the end of the chorus you will hear the singer sing "Singing," you can then play the G above middle C when you hear "Sing" and the E flat; above middle C when you hear "-ing.",
Near the end of the song you can hear that the left hand sounds like the beginning and that the right hand sounds much higher.
For each chord the note that is furthest to the right will be 1, the note furthest to the left is 3, and the note in the middle of notes 1 and 3 is 2.
Listen to the song to put all the pieces above together and you have "Clocks" by Coldplay.

Get a Christmas Tree, of course!,
Get in the festive mood and get some holiday clothes on!,
Go get lots of paper (about 3 or 4 stacks) from Tom Nook.
Go out and buy a present for each one of your neighbors and put one of them in each of the letters you wrote!,
Time travel to Christmas Eve (December 24th, any year) and find Jingle The Reindeer.

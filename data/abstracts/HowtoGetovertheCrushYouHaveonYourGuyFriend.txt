Stop only thinking about him.
Don't cling to him whenever you, your friend, and his crush are together.
If the girl he likes is nice, try to make friends with her.
Try not to care so much about what he thinks.
If you have a close enough friend that's a girl, try seeking her advice.
Try to focus on one of his flaws.
Don't let this ruin your life!,
Do not let this crush ruin your friendship.

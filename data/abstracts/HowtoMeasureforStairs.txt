Familiarize yourself with some basic terminology.
Use the measuring tape to calculate the distance from the bottom of the first floor to the top of the second floor.
Use a calculator to calculate the stair riser length or the number of steps you'll need.
Decide on a length for the treads (the horizontal sections of your steps).
Take the number of risers you have determined you'll need and subtract it by 1 (if you have found that you'll need 20 risers, for example, decrease that number to 19).
Subtract the riser height from the total height from first floor to second floor.
Measure from the bottom of where the first tread will be placed, keeping in mind that the tread will be 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, to the top of the first riser.
Measure for a 1 inch (2.5 cm) overhang on the tread.

Craft four iron blocks.
Collect a pumpkin.
Find an open area.
Place the four iron blocks in a T shape.
Place the pumpkin or jack-o-lantern on top of the T. Place it over the center block, so the structure looks a little like a cross.
Let your iron golem protect villages.
Fence your golem in instead.
Attach a lead to the iron golem.

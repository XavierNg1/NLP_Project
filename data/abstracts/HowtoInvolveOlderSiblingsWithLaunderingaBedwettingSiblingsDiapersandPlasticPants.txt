Ask the bedwetter how they feel about this.Talk to the bedwetter and tell them that you are considering getting the bedwetter's siblings to help out with washing their diapers and plastic pants.
Realize that boys and girls develop at different times.
Talk to the bedwetter's older sibling(s) and get a feel for how they would deal with this issue.
Parents need to be aware of the possibility that an older child might be a bit reluctant to involve their older siblings in such a private matter.
After talking to the siblings and the son or daughter with the bedwetting problem you can talk to everyone together as a group, that way everyone knows the ground rules - what's to be expected of the siblings doing the laundry, that there's to be no teasing of the bedwetter(s), where the bedwetter(s) is to place the wet diapers and plastic pants when they're ready to be laundered, etc.
If the parents are going to wash the diapers and plastic pants all at once they'll need to purchase a diaper pail.

Begin with the Lorentz transformations.
Rewrite the transformations with differentials.
Obtain the velocity as measured in the laboratory frame.
Rewrite in terms of velocities only.
Obtain the addition of velocities in special relativity.
Consider two velocities where simple addition β1+β2>1{\displaystyle \beta _{1}+\beta _{2}>1} in Galilean relativity, e.g.
Substitute and solve.
Show that the speed of light in vacuum is invariant in all reference frames.
Substitute and solve.

Chop an onion and several cloves of garlic.
Put a saucepan over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) olive oil.
Add the onions, garlic, and a pinch of salt and stir.
Cook until the onion is soft and translucent.
Deglaze the pan with a cup of red wine, letting it cook until most of the liquid is gone.
Add a can of whole or crushed tomatoes, with juices, and bring to a boil.
Season with salt, pepper, and fresh basil and turn the heat to low.
Blend the sauce with a hand mixer, blender, or food processor.
Let the sauce simmer, tasting regularly and adding water if it gets too thick, until serving.

Prepare to plant in autumn or early spring, depending on your local climate.
Consider planting in several stages.
Select an area with full sun or partial shade.
Test soil drainage.
Improve soil quality and drainage if necessary.
Till the soil to loosen it if necessary.
Mix the poppy seeds with sand.
Scatter the mixture of seeds and sand barely under the soil.
Water the newly-planted poppy seeds.
Water as necessary.
Reduce the chance of weeds.
Cut out excess poppy plants once they've started to grow.
Fertilize only if necessary.
Remove dead blooms for additional flowers, or leave them on to cause the plants to seed.
Acquire seeds from your best plants.
Avoid transplanting adult plants where possible.
Check the soil in your new location.
Transplant in the evening if possible.
Water the seedlings an hour before transplanting.
Dig a hole in the new location larger than the root ball.
Remove a clump of soil around the poppy plant carefully.
Plant the poppy plant to the same depth in the new soil.

Create a red carpet entrance.
Place the red carpet going up to your door.
Make an awards room as the central party place.

Plan interviews.
Ask questions like:


How do you feel about your new movie, (Movie Name)?,
Provide some pre-show performances.
Hold an awards show.
Hold a VIP party.
Perform makeovers.
Don't try to plan the rest of the party.

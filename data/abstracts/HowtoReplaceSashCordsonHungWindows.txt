Read through these instructions in advance so you're not stuck leaving a window open as you go out for a tool or parts.
Purchase sash cord measured to match your original or to roll well in the pulley wheel.
Start preparing the sash.
If there are metal edge guides that the window slides along (similar to a T cross-section), remove the screws holding each vertical metal guide; you may have to bend one or two, but if the bending is minimal, this should not be a problem.
Remove the temporary screws holding the sash in place with and carefully take it down.
Remove the screw.
Take out the weights on each side, which might be 5-8 lb cast iron solid vertical rounded cylinders with a loop at the top.
Measure off the cord by raising the weight to maximum, then cutting it at a point slightly below (maybe 1-2") where it would reach resting in the window's inside side channel with the window resting at bottom.
Reinstall the bottom side wood pieces by temporarily putting in a screw into the center of their outer faces to help you maneuver them into place (you can fill the holes with putty later if you want), then pull the backing strips out toward window center again just enough to let you maneuver the bottom pieces into place; they may also drop down a little in order to seat properly.
If you have to replace old metal strips taken out earlier, generously oil or trace thoroughly with pencil (graphite) all glide surfaces on both window guide fin and side guide and straighten any bends as best you can.
Replace the inward trim strips you originally pried off, between you and the sash, by nailing them back in (don't use screws or glue, so you or anyone else can repeat this task when needed).
Pour yourself a tall iced lemonade; if guide fins were involved, you probably started on this 2-4 hours ago.

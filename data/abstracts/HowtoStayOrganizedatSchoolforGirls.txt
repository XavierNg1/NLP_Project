Learn the basics of organizing.
Plan.
Start your schedule.
Make sure everything is balanced, and don't forget to spend time on different things like studying- not 'homework studying', but 'revision studying'- exercise, relaxation, social life and whatever else you want to do.
Read the list of requirements your school might have provided you with.
Organize your locker.
Do the same for your folder/binder too.
This might seem obvious to add here, but make sure you always complete your homework.
If you think teachers are giving you too much homework to complete in a short period of time, or your schedule is just too tight to fit any rest in, tell a parent.

Organize your room and work area.
Take a break!,
If you want to add more fuel to your energy tank, exercise!,

Every morning and night.

Always iron your clothes the night before.
If you can, always use frizz tamer to keep your hair free from flyaways.
Whenever you're tying your hair up using bands, always rub a dab of conditioner on the part of the band that will make contact with your hair.
If you want baby soft skin, use a moisturizing lotion instead of normal lotion every day.

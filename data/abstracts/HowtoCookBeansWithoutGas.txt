Keep in mind that the people you are feeding have unique digestive systems that may need up to two weeks to adjust to eating a high fiber food, so encourage patience.
Choose the right kind of beans.
If you are eating canned beans, be sure to rinse them well in a strainer to remove some of the salt.

,
Soak your beans overnight in fresh water to which you add a tablespoon of whey.
Rinse thoroughly in running water until all cloudiness is gone.

,
Measure 2 cups of water for each cup of beans.

,
Add 1 tablespoon of quality oil to the water.
Spices make the difference between healthy beans and delicious beans.
Cook 20-30 minutes, until easily stabbed with a fork.
For bean soup, add more water or broth, whatever leftover vegetables you find and maybe some noodles for fun.

,
Finished.

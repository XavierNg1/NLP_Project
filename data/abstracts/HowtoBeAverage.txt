Look around you.
Dump any boyfriends, girlfriends, partners, or even (and especially) spouses who are outstandingly attractive, successful, radiant, or magnetic.
Stop being cool.
Stop doing interesting things.
Try to develop a weekly schedule.
Do not go to trendy stores.
Buy clothes that do not stand out.
Average people often have some depth to them, but it is only skin deep.
Invite your neighbors over for a barbecue.

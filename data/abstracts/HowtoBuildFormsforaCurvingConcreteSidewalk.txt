Use 12-inch (30.5 cm) hardboard siding (sometimes called Masonite) ripped down to 6-inch (15 cm) strips in 16-ft. (4.8 meter) lengths.
Slice off sod with a sod cutter, then dig out the rest of the sidewalk path to a depth of 6 inch (15 cm).
Start thinking about drainage issues at this point.
Pound in two stakes about 1 ft. (30.5 cm) from the ends of the form positions.
Space and level in the opposite form sides using a homemade gauge board—just a 1x4 that’s a few inches longer than the width of the sidewalk.
Pack the underlying soil with a plate compactor (rent one).
For a long-lasting sidewalk, plan on a base of gravel under 4 in.
Steel mesh with expansion strips prevents heaving, cracking and buckling in cold climates.
Hold the mesh 2 in.

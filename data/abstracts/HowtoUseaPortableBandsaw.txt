Rent or buy the portable bandsaw best suited for your needs.

Familiarize yourself with the tool.

Use the two handles, one located on each end of the saw to hold the tool while it is operated.

Read the operator's manual and become familiar with unique characteristics of your choice of saws, and especially the safety recommendations from the manufacturer.

Dress appropriately for using this tool.
Support loose material when cutting.
Mark the stock you are cutting at the correct angle for your needs.

Place the sawblade against the stock to be cut, making sure the blade is parallel to the cut line you have marked, and perpendicular to the stock (if the cut is to be square, or 90 degrees).
Start the saw by squeezing the trigger and allow the saw to cut its way through the stock you are cutting.
Watch the blade to make sure it is aligned with your cut mark, and slow the cut when you are nearly through the stock so you can anticipate the blade binding if the material flexes or bends suddenly.
Release the trigger and allow the blade to quit moving before setting the saw down after the cut is complete.

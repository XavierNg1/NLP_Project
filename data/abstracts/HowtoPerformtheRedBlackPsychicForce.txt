Pull the four aces from a standard deck of cards.
Fully shuffle the deck (except for the aces) and split in half.

,
Place the four aces in a square, 2 x 2.
Stand facing your two volunteers.
Instruct the volunteers that you will be "projecting" the color of the card into their minds.
Start with the first volunteer.
When you have run out of black cards, say something similar to "Well, I see we're about halfway through the deck.
Repeat step six using the red cards, volunteer two, and the bottom row of aces.

,
At this point, you have all the black cards on the top row covering both the black and red aces, and all the red cards on the bottom row covering both the red and black aces.
Pick up the two piles in the left hand column, and pass each one to the volunteer who "filled" the pile.
While they are examining the cards from the left column, pick up the top right pile and lay it on top of the bottom pile.

,
Pick up the remaining pile.

Ask other children in the higher grades (10th grade and up) if they received any materials list the freshman year.
Prepare to look around the city or town you live in.
Look for copies of the supplies list in the mail.
Walk into the school to see about what supplies they'll need.
Look for the more grown-up-like versions of highlighting tools you once used.
Look for calculators that are called scientific calculators instead of the standard ones you might used to be taking to school, but do not be tempted to purchase any graphing calculators (unless the teacher later tells you you'll need to purchase a graphing one).
Base some of your other essentials on some of the electives you'll potentially be taking.
Look for a few additional items you might not be used to taking to class with you.
Buy at least one compass and protractor for schoolwork now.
Purchase a stainless steel (with a corkboard-like backing) straightedge/ruler with you for every math class.

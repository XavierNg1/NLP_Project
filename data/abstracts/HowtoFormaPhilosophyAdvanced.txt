Decide what philosophy you want to think about, it may be anything from Axiology to Metaphysics; you decide.
Go even deeper now and select a sub-category; for example if you chose Metaphysics, you'll need to decide whether you want to examine ontology, philosophy of mind or body, or religion.
Start by making notes on what you think on the subject, even if your views are ill-informed, write them down.
If you don't have an idea don't worry, start by doing some research into it, look at both sides and form an opinion.
For those who have an idea, start looking at why you think what you think.
Once you have done that, do some research, look at both sides, but don't form an opinion, as stated for those without an idea.

,
Now, take everything you have; your opinion, other people's opinions and why you and they think that.
Start by tearing into the problem, it may be is there a reality?,
Have an argument with yourself, make a statement about the subject, like 'I know there is a reality, because I can sense it'.
Counter argue, 'but have your senses never deceived you before?'.
Keep doing this until you get to some truth or certainty and if you can't just say it is impossible to know and ask why is it impossible for me to know?,
Once you have a truth, build it up, allow your thought to expand out like tree roots, starting from one root or truth and growing more roots, i.e.
Continue arguing these points to ensure these are truths and just keep going.

Eventually, you might just have a strong argument for there being a reality, it is a good idea to write these down in a notebook throughout your forming of the philosophy, you can then write these more formally, at a later date.

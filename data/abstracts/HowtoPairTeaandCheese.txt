Refer to the pairings in the same way as for pairing wine and cheese.Unlike wine, however, you don't have to account for acid levels (as found in wine) or make any attempt to match by region (tea and cheese do not usually arise from the same regions, again unlike wine).For example, expect the tannins in the tea to balance out any rich or sweet elements of the cheese; while a sweet tea can be balanced by a salty cheese.
Treat the warmth of the tea as a distinct tasting benefit.
Be aware of the tannin levels in the tea.
Set up at least three to five types of cheese and paired teas to make the tasting worthwhile.Variety is especially important if you're holding a party.
Pair cheese according to your wine and cheese favorites.
Pair salty cheese with sweet teas or floral teas.
Pair soft or semi-firm and creamy cheese with milder fresh black tea or soft green teas.
Pair black tea with most types of cheese, if in doubt.
Pair strongly flavored (hard and soft) cheeses with stronger, high tannin teas.
Be adventurous.
Choose three to five types of cheese.
Choose a range of tea types to pair with the cheeses.
Display the cheese slices on plain plates and use plain teacups for the tea.

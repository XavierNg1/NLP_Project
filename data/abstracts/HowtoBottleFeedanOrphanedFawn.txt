Use an appropriate fawn replacement formula or goat's milk.
Add suitable supplements along with the goat's milk or fawn replacement formula, depending on the fawn's size:


Newborn fawns: They are about the same size as two chihuahuas (more or less) and are unable to process solid foods as of yet.
Make sure that the nipple hole size is appropriate.
Heat up the formula so that it is slightly over lukewarm before feeding it to the deer.
Use a funnel to fill two bottles (per deer per feeding) with the formula or milk.
Hold the bottles up high when feeding.

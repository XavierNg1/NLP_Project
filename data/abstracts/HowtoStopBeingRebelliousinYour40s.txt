Identify what you are rebelling against and why.
Understand that you are most likely embarrassing your children.
Realize that you no longer have to “fight the man” because most likely you actually are "the man”.
Embrace this new era in your life where you can be confident about who you are and celebrate the accomplishments you’ve achieved.
Consider other productive ways you could be using this rebellious energy.

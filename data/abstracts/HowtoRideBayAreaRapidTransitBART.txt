Practice good train etiquette.
Exit the train.
Insert the ticket into the turnstile (or touch your card) on your way out.
BART trains are more likely to be a little late than a little early.If you are boarding the station at a time when trains are crowded, and wish to use the front or rear car to maximize the chances of seating space, budget an extra minute to walk to the end of the platform.
Check BART's Quick Planner to get their estimates of the crowdedness of trains.
If you are really interested in getting seating space and don't mind your commute being longer (for instance, if you'd like to sit and work on your laptop), and your direction of travel is crowded, consider riding in the opposite direction and then boarding a less crowded train in the direction you're going.
A scheduled transfer is a transfer between trains where both trains arrive at about the same time at a station, but the train being transferred to will not wait for the other train if it is delayed.
Occasionally, the BART system encounters delays due to reasons ranging from medical emergencies on trains, equipment issues on trains and tracks, and police activity at stations.

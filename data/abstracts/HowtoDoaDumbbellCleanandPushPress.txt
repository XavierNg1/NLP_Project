Use a dependable dumbbell, one that the plates will not slide off.
With the dumbbell between your legs, grasp the dumbbell with your chalked (magnesium carbonate) hand.
Pull the dumbbell with you arm straight and with your legs and back.
Once you have the above step wired into your nervous system, add a little backswing of the dumbbell after lifting it off the floor and before pulling.
The back (spine) should not be twisted, or rounded or arched.
At the end of the pull, when your body is almost straightened, use your calves, a shoulder shrug, front deltoids and biceps to power clean the dumbbell to your shoulder.
Do not press the dumbbell yet.
After pressing the dumbbell to lockout, lower it with control to the shoulders and to the floor between your legs.
Observe your back, in the bottom position, in this and other lifts to check that your back is straight and not twisted.
Use control when lowering the dumbbell.
Finished.

A month or two before going to your new school, check with your friends to see if they are moving to the same school as you.
Before the big day, check the school website.
Prepare the night before.
Brush your teeth, have a shower, brush your hair (and style it the way you want), get dressed, put on deodorant, and do any other morning routines.
Remember to have breakfast!,
If you are going on a bus, make sure you leave the house 20 minutes before the bus is due to leave.
Arrive at school on time, with your bag packed, and ready to make friends and work hard.
If you are assigned a locker, don't let anyone know your combination, or take your key.
When going to your classroom, you may be assigned a buddy.

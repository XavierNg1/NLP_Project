Buy skirts that go at least as far as your knees.
Make sure that your pants are not low rise.
Make sure your shorts reach close to your knees and are not showing your upper thigh or butt.
Your T-shirts should cover your whole shoulder.
When buying anything from shoes, to purses, to clothes, make sure the colours complement your skin and eyes.
Try little or no makeup.

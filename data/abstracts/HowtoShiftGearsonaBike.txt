Count the number of gears at the base of the pedals.
Count the number of gears on the rear wheel.
Multiply the two numbers to find how many gears your bike has.
Use your left hand to shift the front gears.
Use your right hand to shift the rear gears.
Gear down to make your pedaling easier but less powerful.
Gear up to make your pedaling harder but more powerful.
Practice shifting up and down in a flat area.
Only shift while you're pedaling forward.
Pick a low gear when you start off.
Gradually gear up as you build up speed.
Shift down for hills.
Shift up when on fairly level ground and for downhill areas.
Shift up carefully to avoid hurting your joints.
Avoid choosing gears that "crisscross" the chain.

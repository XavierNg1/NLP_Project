Use a target and a clicker.
Raise the target a bit over the dog's head.
Lift the target up even higher so that the dog has to stand on her hind legs.
This time, when the dog stands on her hind legs, let her be in that position a little longer bit by bit.
Move the target away from the dog, but just a little bit, and higher this time.
Increase the claims.
Remove the target and wait for the dog to jump towards you.
Add a command.
Test the trick.

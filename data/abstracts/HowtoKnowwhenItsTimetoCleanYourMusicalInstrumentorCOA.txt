Take care of your instrument.
Pay attention to your instrument when you are playing it.
Get an idea of your instrument's general outside appearance.
Take a look at the pads and check to see if they're leaking.
Check the instrument's mechanism.
Make sure your corks are in good condition.
Decide if there's anything you want adjusted, even if it's not really something "wrong" with the instrument.
Take your instrument (and mental/written list of things to be done) down to the music store, and ask for a COA.
When the repair work is done, play-test your instrument, take it home, and enjoy it, now that it looks and plays its best.

Avoid the mindset that everybody is a total, morally corrupt, jerk.
Don't appear as condescending.
Gain respect, then take advantage of it by being a good influence as a member of an online community with a great reputation.~ Avoid participating in not-so-great activities, because other people will see and then follow your wrong path.~ Too many respected people today can not use their "creds" of respect to lead people along the right path -- because they're not on the right path themselves!

Encourage a friend nicely against trolling.
Ask for an opinion: sincerely "seek agreement" and "say thanks", while using suggestions.
Hold off of carelessly "angering" people that you want to influence, and hold back put-downs and name-calling which are negative, abrasive, caustic and ineffective.
Talk positively.
Defuse online arguments.

Determine if your toddler is still getting enough nourishment with your breast milk alone.
Determine how much the toddler weighs.
Determine if your child can still sit adequately near or next to you, to continue to confidently feed at/on your breast.
Make sure to provide adequate times of relaxation for your toddler and yourself, to ensure your breasts don't get too overworked, and to make sure the toddler can still get enough milk.
Recognize that now that your toddler is well-trained in how to feed at your breasts properly, the time he/she takes at your breast will begin to diminish.
Minimize any and all distractions that may go on around you and your toddler.
Don't try to overwork your toddler, and "make them solely" drink at your breast.
Continue to use the same procedure for breastfeeding as to what was used when your child was smaller, as compared to now.

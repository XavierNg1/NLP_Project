The moment you realise that the opponent is serious about doing damage to you, put yourself in a position where your vital points (see step three/tips) are offline, meaning that they are not easy targets for your opponent.
Examine your opponent's vital points.
Get yourself in a low stance, one that is not easily shifted by your opponent.
Attack whatever you can logically get at.
Remember the axiom "the best defense is a good offense.",
Dynamically respond to what your opponent does.
Manipulate your opponent's body weight.
Your surroundings contain surfaces much harder than anything on your body.

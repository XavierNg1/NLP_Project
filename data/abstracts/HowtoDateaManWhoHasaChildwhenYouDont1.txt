Be honest with yourself.
Expect grief.
Accept second place in the beginning.
Know that you’re beginning more than one relationship.
Expect the unexpected.
Realize that you won’t be sharing “firsts.” Whether you’re hoping to marry the father and/or have children of your own, accept the fact that the father has already achieved one or both of these milestones.
Reassess your needs.

Your first step is to get rid of the old carpet.
Start at one end and pull the carpet off the tackless strips and roll it up in sections.
DO NOT REMOVE THE TACKSTRIPS and make sure the floor is clean and dry.
Install new tackless strips if it is new construction or you are going over hardwood floor or vinyl around the perimeter of the room, but not in front of doorways.
Put the under pad down in strips that butt up to or reach the tackless strips.
To install carpet properly, you need to start with a piece that overlaps the edge of the floor by 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2Â cm).
If your room is wide enough that you're going to need another piece of carpet, follow the same process with the second piece - measure, mark and trim.
Where the carpet pieces will join, overlap the two pieces, and then using a utility knife or a rented seam cutter, cut through both pieces of carpet, ensuring the edges will match exactly.
Use a knee kicker to attach the carpet along one edge.
A carpet stretcher will finish attaching the carpet.
Work your way around the room stretching the carpet over the tackless strips, and trim the carpet near the wall with a utility knife or a wall trimmer.

Using a stair tool, tuck the carpet down into the gap between the tackless strips and the wall.
That's it.
Finished.

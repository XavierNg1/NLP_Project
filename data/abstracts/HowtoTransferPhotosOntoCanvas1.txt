Gather your supplies.
Print out your image on a laser printer.
Use a thick coat of gel medium to cover the front of your canvas completely.
Line the image up with the canvas — ink-side down — and press down to flatten.
Allow canvas to dry overnight.
Starting on one side of the canvas, lightly wet the surface with water from a spray bottle.
Apply a final coat of gel medium to the canvas once you've stripped it of paper.

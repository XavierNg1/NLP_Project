Think over what isn't working out about this friendship.
Delete this friend from your contacts, email, phone, etc.
Tell this person exactly why this happened.
When you begin to regret (that will happen), just remind yourself that this was done "for the better".
They are going to say or do something.
Don't dwell on the past.
As much as you want to think, they won't change.
Don't let them manipulate you.
It may seem like the worst decision of your life and nothing will ever be right again, but that's not true.

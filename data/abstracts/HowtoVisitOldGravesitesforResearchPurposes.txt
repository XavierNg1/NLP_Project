Find out where your ancestors are buried:


Ask relatives or friends if they know where family members are buried.
Get your basic supplies that will be needed to make your visit to the cemetery useful.
Check to see if the historical or genealogical society in the locality of the cemeteries or likely cemeteries where your ancestors are buried has published (in book form or online) a recording of gravestone data for the cemeteries in question.
Be prepared to do a lot of walking while attempting to find the correct grave, especially if there is no groundskeeper to direct you.
Plan a spring or fall visit if this is an old cemetery, or phone ahead and verify that this lot is mowed regularly.
Copy down all the information on the stone if you find a family member's grave, even if you think you don't need it.
Remember if there is a military marker or flag next to or on the grave.
Bring a camera and take pictures of each gravestone in the family.
It is also very important, again for purposes of relocating a stone, to not only take closeups of each gravestone of interest, but also shots of the ENTIRE stone, with nearby stones also in the photograph, as well as overview shots of the entire surrounding cemetery.
Also (very important!),
Note that if the gravestone is hard to read because of age or deterioration, use shaving cream and a squeegee to make it easier to read.
Leave a sign that you have visited the grave, according to your faith's traditions.
Make sure all of your notes are clear.

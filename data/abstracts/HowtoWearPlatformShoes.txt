Platform shoes and boots have sort of slipped off of the radar in the fashion world.
Who looks best in platform shoes?,
Basic black is a good color.
Chunky platform sandals or clogs are a handy way for women who are more on the heavyset side to enhance their basic body type; again, it helps make feet/legs look proportional to the rest of the body.
The secret to making platforms work is to keep them a bit on the understated side.

Preheat the oven to 350 °F (177 °C) and grease your baking dish.
Choose the right apples for the best apple crisps.
Slice and core the apples, removing the skins first if desired.
Toss the apples in large bowl, then add lemon juice, sugar, and flour.
Pour the apples into your baking dish and top evenly with topping.
Cook until the top is golden brown and the apples are bubbling -- about 35 minutes.

If you see a bull in a pasture or field with cows, avoid going in the field at all costs.
If you absolutely must to go through the field be aware that a bull may see you as a threat and warn you to keep away.
Be aware that, some bulls can go after you without you even aware of it until he's trying to put snot down your back pockets.
If you absolutely have to go in the same corral with a bull, pack a weapon with you.

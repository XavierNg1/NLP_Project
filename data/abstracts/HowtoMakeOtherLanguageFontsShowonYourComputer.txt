Go to the Start Menu, and click on Control Panel.
There is an option in the Control Panel that should say something to the effect of “Date, Time, Language, and Regional Options.” (If you have Windows XP, then this is the exact wording.),
You should be in this folder, unless you have locked it in the past.
Only after you start the installation and it has already asked for the required CD-ROM, put in the CD.

Cinnamon, like honey, contains trace amounts of peroxide and will not dry out your hair.
Wet your hair (in the shower, the sink, or using a spray bottle) and work in conditioner.
In a bowl, mix cinnamon and water into a paste.
Spread the cinnamon-and-water paste into your hair.
Leave the cinnamon mixture in your hair for 4-8 hours, depending on the shade of your hair.
When you are ready, rinse the cinnamon out of your hair.

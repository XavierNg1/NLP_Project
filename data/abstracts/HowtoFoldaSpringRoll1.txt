Lay the wrap out flat.
Make an egg mixture.
Dip a pastry brush into the egg mixture and brush the two opposite sides of the wrap (top and bottom).
Place the filling on the rolls.
Fold the left and right sides of the wrapper over the mixture.
Fold the bottom of the wrap up over the filling.
Continue to fold the roll.
Once the folds on the side are covered up on the side, roll the sheet through.
If the last corner won't fold, spread some egg mixture onto it and stick it to the rest of the roll.
Continue the rolling method for the rest of your spring rolls.
Fry them until they're golden brown.

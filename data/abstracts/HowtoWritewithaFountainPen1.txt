Balance the pen.
Take the pen in your dominant hand.
Rest the barrel on the bottom knuckle of your middle finger.
Hold the pen toward the paper at a 40 to 55 degree angle.The angle is extremely important, since it moves the tines away from the feed and allows ink to flow.
Keep the nib level with the paper.

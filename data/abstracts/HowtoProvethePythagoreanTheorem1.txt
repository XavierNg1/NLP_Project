Draw four congruent right triangles.
Arrange the triangles so that they form a square with sides a+b.
Rearrange the same four triangles such that they form two equal rectangles inside a larger square.
Recognize that the area not formed by the triangles is equal in both arrangements.
Set the areas of each arrangement equal to each other.

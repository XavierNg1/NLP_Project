Have a throat swab to diagnose the specific cause of your sore throat.The vast majority of sore throats (cases of pharyngitis) are viral.
Take antibiotics for bacterial pharyngitis.Once the cause or your sore throat has been confirmed (and assuming that it is indeed bacterial), you will most likely be prescribed a course of oral antibiotics.
Use Acetaminophen (Tylenol) to ease pain and fever.In addition to taking antibiotics to treat the cause of the infection, you may wish to take Acetaminophen to ease other symptoms.
Be aware of the expected recovery time.Your bacterial pharyngitis symptoms should begin to improve one to two days after beginning antibiotic treatment.
Drink plenty of fluids.When you are sick, your body loses more fluids than it normally does as it works to fight off the infection.
Get plenty of rest.As with any infection, it helps to get as much rest (and sleep) as possible, because this boosts your immune system and helps to fight off the bug faster.
Try sucking on lozenges.Sucking on lozenges can soothe the pain of a sore throat.
Gargle warm salt water.Mix half a teaspoon of salt in one cup of water.
Use a humidifier.A humidifier adds moisture to the air and can help to soothe a sore throat.
Stay away from others for the duration of your illness.Bacterial pharyngitis can be transmitted through droplets in the air or by touching surfaces that have also been touched by an infected person.
Wash your hands.Washing your hands frequently (and thoroughly) will also help to prevent others from catching it.
Clean shared surfaces and avoid sharing whenever possible.Finally, to prevent transmission of your bacterial pharyngitis to others, refrain from sharing objects whenever possible.

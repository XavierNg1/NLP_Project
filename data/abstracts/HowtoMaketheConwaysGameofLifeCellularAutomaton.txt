Since a cellular automaton produces visual phenomena, you will need to use a programming language in which you know how to render graphics to the screen.
Assuming that you have a programming language in which you know how to create simple graphics, the first task is to understand what a cellular automaton looks like and how it evolves over time.
That's basically all the Game of Life is - just a 2D grid of cells.
To draw this grid to the screen, you need a double-nested loop which reads each cell, calculating each position depending on its place in the grid.You will then need a loop which constantly reads the cells and generates the next generation from them using the Game of Life's rules.
The rules of the Game of Life are as follows:

If a cell (whether ON or OFF) has exactly 2 or 3 ON cells in the 8 cells surrounding it, then that cell becomes (or remains) ON.After the new generation has been created, it should replace the old one and become the current generation.
Now the process repeats: clear the screen, redraw the grid, calculate the next generation as described above.
That's it!,
Once you've got it working and have had fun watching it, you might want to try making your own rules.

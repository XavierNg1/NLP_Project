Scout out your opponent's location with a probe (usually the one that builds your first Pylon at 7 psi).
Build a double gate proxy close to their choke, but far away enough so that they cannot be seen or hit by Siege Tanks (Terrans will lift their Barracks to spot for their Tanks).
Pump Zealots from your two Gateways, and make sure to build more Probes and Pylons back at base.
Rush the Terran with around 6-8 Zealots if he did wall in.
Pick off the SCV building a Factory, if it is not finished yet for some reason.
Kill as many SCVs as possible and keep the SCVs away from the minerals as long as possible.
Tech up and build up if your proxy fails and the Terran has Tanks and Vultures out (Goliaths soon).

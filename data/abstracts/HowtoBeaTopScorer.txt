Find your best method of studying maybe like mind maps if you enjoy colors and are creative( to learn important concepts), listening to others(teachers,yourself on a tape recorder talking about a particular chapter,etc.
Just so you're well informed,timetables don't usually work so instead of them try using sticky notes to constantly remind yourself of topics that you need to study for the day and stick to them.
Make sure you allocate time to do your studies and study daily.
ALL ROUNDER.
Make studying fun.
In your free time, this is especially for mathematics, do a few sums and treat them like puzzles.

Treat yourself.
Make sure you understand what you are learning.
Believe in yourself.

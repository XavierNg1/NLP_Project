Examine the wallpaper border carefully.
Measure the width and length of the border.

,
Cut a roll of paper such as brown craft paper, butchers paper, plain gift wrap or unprinted newspaper the same width minus a 1/4” (1/2 cm) as the border and in a piece as long as each wall.
Beginning at a corner, place the paper you cut over the wallpaper border.
Using painters tape or masking tape, tape the paper in a few places at the top of the border to hold it up.

,
Tape along the bottom edge carefully.
Tape the top edge of the paper covering the border if you will be painting the ceiling or wall above it, just like above.

,
Paint a line about 3 to 4” (7-1/2 to 10 cm) wide just below, (or above if painting above it), the paper covering the border.
Paint the rest of the wall or ceiling.

,
Remove the tape and paper carefully as soon as the paint dries.

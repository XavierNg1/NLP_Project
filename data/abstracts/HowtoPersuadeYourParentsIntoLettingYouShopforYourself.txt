Set up a full morning or afternoon to weed out your current wardrobe.
Make up 4 signs for the piles you will create, to keep them separate as you work to go:


things that don't fit, but are still in good condition and can be passed down or donated.
Once you've done the weed out, invite your parents in so they can check your good work, and then you carefully bag up the donations and the trash, and box the off-season things for storage.
Make a written list.

If you're in class and you get a chance to pick partners or your teacher assigns you partners just sit and help him out like a normal girl.
Make him laugh with your sense of humor.
Wear nice clothes and add accessories.
If you have a shirt that matches your eyes and makes them pop, wear it and see what he thinks, or, add a bit of eyeliner and/or mascara if you have it but make sure not to overdo it.
Be you.
Smile a lot and be nice, help him out whenever he needs it.
Make sure to hang out with him and mess around, e.g. telling funny jokes!,
If you wear uniform, do something to your uniform like add a badge or a brooch (not so big that it goes against school uniform rules) but just enough to show your style

And also don't be too upset if he doesn't like you back sometimes its just not meant to be but always keep your head up and make every moment count!!!

Draw a neat circle or square on the paper.
Fill the circle or square with water.
Take the brightest colour you want to use and paint a cloud-like shape in the middle of the circle or square.
Paint around the edge of the square or circle with black paint.
Take a lighter shade of the bright cloud colour used earlier and add highlights in and around the cloud.

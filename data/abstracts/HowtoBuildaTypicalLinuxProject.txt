If the project has no explicit releases, you may need to pull the source code directly from its CVS or SVN repository.
Look into the files README and INSTALL that should be at the top folder in the downloaded project.
Some projects provide the build script as a shell script (usually named build.sh).
Search for the file called configure which also must be present in a project top folder.
Search for the file called makefile which may be initially present or appear after you run configure.
If there is no configure nor makefile in the project tree, it may be an ant - powered project with the build.xml file instead.
If ant doesn't work either, or the project is C or C++, try running ./autogen.sh to create the configure and makefile files.
After you succeeded to compile the makefile - based project, try make install to place the project files into appropriate locations (to install the project).
After the installation succeeds, try to type the short project name.

Lay out your path.
Calculate how many square feet the path will be.
Before you start digging the path, be sure there are no utilities or irrigation lines in the area where you are putting your path.
Remove the existing sod and soil using flat shovels.
Once the area is excavated, be sure the soil below is slightly damp and compact the soil using a heavy flat object or the plate compactor.
Place at least two pipes directly on the compacted soil.
Place a border course of pavers around the entire edge, then place the rest in the desired pattern.
Compact the pavers using something heavy and flat.
Spread dry joint sand over the surface and sweep some into the joints.

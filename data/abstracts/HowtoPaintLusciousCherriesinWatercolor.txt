Purchase a handful of ripe cherries from the store.
Set up your still life arrangement.
Keep the cherries as the central theme since they are the subject.
Put the cherries on a white or other plain cloth.
Set up your watercolor paints.
Obtain a sheet of 140# watercolor paper.
Sketch your design lightly.
Plan how to make the two dimensional circles appear realistic, rounded and plump.
Wet a few of the circles for cherries, preserving the highlight by keeping the spot dry to resist paint.
Paint some of the cherry shapes without wetting them first.
While wet, paint cast shadows.
Paint leaves the same way.
Look carefully at the cherries' stems.
Work on the cloth under the cherries.
Draw a jar, or bowl.
If you wish to add a background, do it at this point.
Add final touches.
Again, prop up the painting, step back and study it.
Hang up your painting.

In order to capitalize on the chain counting principles, you must be able to take every chain that is made.
If your opponent plays within a loop, leave four boxes and play so that there is a space between two boxes on either side of your last line.In 3x3, there are 9 boxes - you need 5 to win

,In 5x5, there are 25 boxes - you need 13 to win

,
In 7x7, there are 49 boxes - you need 25 to win


Because you must sacrifice boxes to obtain all the chains in the game, it is sometimes possible for your opponent to make a bunch of boxes.

,
Be careful not to allow the amount of boxes you sacrifice get too high as you might sacrifice too many and lose the game.
Let's call the person who is going to get all the chains the 'leader' and the other person the 'follower'.
Turn a chain into a loop.
Everyone makes mistakes, sometimes you can use this to your advantage.
Y-Chains are complicated as there is more than one branch that can be considered a chain.
Y-Loops are similar to Y-Chains but instead of multiple chain branches, Y-Loops have branches that loop.
If you are the follower, you want as many boxes as possible to make up for losing the chains.

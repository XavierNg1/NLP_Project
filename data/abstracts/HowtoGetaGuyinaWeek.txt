Make sure this guy is worthy of your attention.
Catch his eye.
Get him worked up.
Hold his gaze.
Be in the right place at the right time.
Initiate contact.
Don't act like you're desperate, play hard to get until he notices you.
When he does talk to you, don't act eager, let him want you, and look straight into his eyes.

,
Make sure you're noticed.
Talk to him and find a little about him (vice versa) so you two will have a better connection.

,
Flirt with him and let him know that you are interested but always be yourself!

,
Try to break the "touch" ice.

If you're on the fence about whether your own family members will behave during the wedding, it's a little touchy to assume the worst and fairly inflammatory to make direct comments about your worries about how they might behave at your wedding.
Discuss the possibility of the unruly guest with your wedding planner or event coordinator.
Consider a cash bar and/or a limited alcohol service.
Be smart about seating arrangements.
Allot a very trusted friend or group of friends to act as wedding and reception guardians.

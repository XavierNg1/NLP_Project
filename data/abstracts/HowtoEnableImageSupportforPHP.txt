If you're trying to enable thumbnail generation on MediaWiki and you encounter an error like Fatal error: Call to undefined function: imagecreatefromjpeg() .
Download and install the JPEG library from here.
This will install the library in your /usr/local directory.Only do this if you want to compile GD yourself.
Download and install the LIBPNG library.
Now that these 2 libraries are installed, it's time to compile PHP.
After this, it's time to restart Apache:

httpd -k restart







,
If you get a warning about the PHP module already being loaded, remove either the LoadModule in httpd.conf or remove the php.conf file in /etc/httpd/conf.d.

,Now you should have images support for PHP!

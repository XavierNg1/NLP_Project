Start a simple project.
Show the child how to do the stitch you are using in your pattern.
Allow them to try making the next stitch.
Catch their mistakes and talk them through the solution.
After the first stitch, some kids will give the project back to you.
Keep trading it off between the two of you until they're comfortable with the basic stitch(es) you're teaching them, or you finish it and need to teach them how to tie off.

,
Show them how to start a project the same way you showed them how to do one stitch.
Let them work on this project by themselves, only asking you for help if they need it.

,
Show them what the pattern looks like.
Once they finish this project, ask them what they'd like to make next.
Show them any new skills that this pattern might have.

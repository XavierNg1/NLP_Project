Eat just prior to entering the festival.
Try to come close to drinking equal parts water and beer.
Have a list of beers and a plan.
Remember to balance your taste buds.
Make sure you actually taste the beers.
Keep a record of your favorite beer rather than trying to quaff down more of them.
Most importantly, have yourself a designated driver or some plan to avoid having to drive after the festival.

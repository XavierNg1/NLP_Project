Select a 12' to 15' (feet) (3.6m to 4.5m) length of half-inch (1.27cm) three-stranded rope.
Finish one end of the rope by whipping it, clamping it with a ferrule, dipping, or heat-treating it.
Mark a point with your hand about 12 to 15 inches (30.5cm to 38cm) from the whipped end of the rope.
Place the short end on your right and the long end on your left.
Isolate any one of the open strands with your thumb and index finger of your left hand.
Position the rope so that the eye loop is on your left hand with the short end pointing towards 3 o'clock and the long end pointing towards 6 o'clock.
Use your left hand to insert the long end of the rope from the bottom up under and through these two strands.
With the eye loop in your right, grasp the short end of the rope between your left thumb and forefinger about 2 inches (5cm) from the whipped end.
Line these three loops up in order and work a sharpened stick of the same diameter of the rope into the loops.
Run the long end of the rope into and through the eye of the loop.
Permanently finish the long end of the rope halter in the manner you choose.

A7:A1447: No change
B7 amd B8:B1447: No change
C7 and C8:C1447: No change
D7:D1447: "=IF(COS((ROW()-7)*PI()/180*Factor)
E7:E1447: "=IF(SIN((ROW()-7)*PI()/180*Factor)
F7:F1447: Probably no change -- "=IF(A7=0,F6,((PI())*((SIN(B7/(C7*2))*GMLL*COS(B7)*GMLL*(COS(B7/(C7*2)))*GMLL)+D7)))"
G7:G1447: Probably no change -- "=IF(A7=0,G6,((PI())*((SIN(B7/(C7*2))*GMLL*SIN(B7)*GMLL*(COS(B7/(C7*2)))*GMLL)+E7)))"
H7:H1447: No changeÂ  -- "=F7*GMLL*Sync1"
I7:I1447: No change -- "=G7*GMLL*Sync1"
J7:J1447 and K7:K1447 No change.

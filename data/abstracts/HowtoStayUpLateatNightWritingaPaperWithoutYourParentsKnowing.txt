Make a schedule.
Don't rush going to bed.
After you let them think you are in bed, quietly get up and shut the door and all lights, if they aren't already.
Wait until you know for sure that your parents are asleep.
If your parents go to bed at 10, wait until at least 10:30 to start your work, or if they go to bed at 10:30, wait until at least 11:00, etc.
Be very quiet.
Get right to work.
Work straight through until you have finished any and all book research.

,
Now write your paper if you haven't got any more online research to do.
Keep measuring your time.
Go to bed.

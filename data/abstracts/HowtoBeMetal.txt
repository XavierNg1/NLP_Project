Donâ€™t be judgmental.
Be yourself.
Live by the music.
Read between the lines.
Recognize the fantasy.
Get nerdy.
Honor the sound.
Fight ignorance.
Know your history.
Know the subgenres.
Familiarize yourself with the labels, then forget them.
Learn concert etiquette.
Perfect your devil horns.
Wear metal shirts.
Sew those patches on.
Wear boots.
Accessorize.
Grow your hair long.

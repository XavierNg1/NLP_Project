Start with some good handmade soap, available often at a local crafty farmer's market or craft store.
Cut the nylons up and knot them at one end to make a nylon stocking bag.

,
Start wrapping the soap with wool roving.
Take the wool wrapped soap and put it in the nylon stocking.
Get the soap wet in warm water, as warm as is comfortable to a child's hand.

,
Have them rub it around gently in their hands first, working up to firmer and firmer rubbing.
Check the progress after 10 or 15 minutes.

,
When they really can't stand to sit there and do it any more, take the bars out and be done with it.

,
Lay them out in a sunny spot to dry.

,
Don't worry about the imperfections.

Teach your child that charity is not only about money.
Let your child understand the long process and the effectiveness of charity.
Bring the child to various places around the world where people are living in harsh conditions.
Discuss with the child about how important charity is.
Tell your child that you should feel good about helping others and the victims who are helped would always be happy to help you too.
If the child is still negotiating, ask your child to live a life like people in developing countries (but obviously not supplying your child with unclean water etc.).
Once the child has understood charity, ask them in what ways they can contribute.
Ask your child to spread the knowledge with his or her friends and tell them how much you have contributed to charity.
Explain to them why you should not live a life like them.

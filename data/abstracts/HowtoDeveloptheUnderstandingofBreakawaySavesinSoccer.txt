Recognize that there are three stages at which the save can be made in a breakaway situation.
To deal with the breakaway situation the goalkeeper must rely on the following visual cues: the speed and angle of the ball, the speed and location of the first attacker, and the presence and location of any other attackers.
The save can become a foot race if the lead pass to the attacker is too strong or if the attacker's first touch is too far ahead of her.
There are some areas to consider when making the breakaway save.
The goalkeeper should also master the concepts of angle play and correct positioning.
To ensure that the keeper is protected it is important that they have the grass cutter or low ball save technique mastered.
A final note...The goalkeeper's primary focus should always be on the ball, not on the opponent's eyes.

Make sure you have a good position.
Walk the horse first.
Cluck to the horse and see if they respond to that before you kick.
Make sure you post to the beat of the horse.
Gather your reins so that they aren't too loose.
Control the horse.
Once you are ready to stop, lean back a little bit and say "Whoa" or "Ho" in a deep voice.
Keep practicing.
Have fun while it lasts.

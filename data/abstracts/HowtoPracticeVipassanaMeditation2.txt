Start by settling your body.
Be generous with this time to relax.
Move your awareness around your body to make any needed adjustments.
Focus gently on your object.
Continue to observe and explore.
Let go of more things once the mind settles.
Allow the meditation to follow its course.
After the meditation, reflect.

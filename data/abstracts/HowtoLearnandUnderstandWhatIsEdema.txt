Know what is edema.
Know the factors that cause edema.
Under normal conditions these two forces oppose each other and the net result is maintaining the fluid inside the blood capillaries.
This causes in turn a state of edema.
One type of localized edema is caused by inflammation of the skin for example.
Learn the compounds that trigger edema.
The amount of edema is restricted due to the presence of lymphatic circulation which can accommodate liquids in the interstitial space.
In addition to edema that occurs in acute inflammation there is edema due to allergic reaction in the skin.
This in turn causes leakage of fluid from the blood capillaries into the interstitium.
Learn what medical conditions trigger edema.
The induction of the sympathetic nervous system leads to renal arteries constriction with accompanying decreased filtration in the glomeruli.
Generalized edema can occur also due to lack of sufficient amounts of proteins in the blood.
The hypovolemia that comes as a result induces the sympathetic nervous system.
The causes of hypoproteinemia are either malnutrition or decreased proteins synthesis by the liver as occurs in liver failure.

Put your corgi in a comfortable crate when you cannot be with it.
Choose a crate big enough for the corgi to stretch and turn around, but no bigger.
Put a comfortable, easily washed pad at the bottom of the crate.
Wait before letting a whining corgi out of its crate.
Reward your dog for getting into its crate.
Take the dog outside immediately when you arrive home.

Add the 3/4 cup powdered milk, 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 1/2 tablespoons shortening, and 1 1/2 cups hot water to a mixing bowl.
In another bowl, add yeast and 1/8 teaspoon sugar to 1 1/2 cup warm water.
Add the yeast mixture to the powdered milk mixture.
Add the flour, remaining salt and mix well with a stiff spatula.
Knead the dough on a floured surface or with a dough hook.
Cover the bowl and let the batter rise in a warm place for at least an hour.
Divide the dough into 10 even pieces using a sharp knife, then roll into balls.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and sprinkle liberally with cornmeal.
Let the muffins rise for another hour.
Preheat a griddle to 300F, or a pan to medium heat.
Add a pat of butter to the griddle once hot.
Add dough balls to the pan or griddle, spacing by an inch.
Cook each muffin for 5-6 minutes on each side.
Once both sides are browned, remove and place on a wire rack to cool.
Allow muffins to cool and then split with a fork.

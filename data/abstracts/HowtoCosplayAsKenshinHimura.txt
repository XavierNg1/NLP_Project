Kenshin has red/orange hair which is pulled back into a ponytail.
He has a sort of kimono-top, much like InuYasha's Cloak of The Fire Rat.
He has white, baggy pants and a white obi belt.
When choosing a katana, choose a plastic or foam one.
His cheek-scar is in the shape of a cross with the vertical line fairly long (doesn't touch bottom of face, though) and the horizontal line short on the left side and longer on the right.
Kenshin is a kind, calm, forgiving individual.

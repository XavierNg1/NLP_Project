Take some time to mourn.
Delete old correspondence.
Unfriend or unfollow them on social media.Seeing what your friends are up to without you will just cause you to dwell on the past instead of looking toward the future.
Take down photographs.
Write down how you feel.
Don’t blame yourself.
See a therapist.
Call a family member.
Consult friends you don't have in common with your lost friend.Reach out to people who don't know the friend or friends you are no longer hanging out with.
Be mindful of your mutual friendships.
Don't bad mouth your lost friend.
Know that you’ll make new friends.
Be grateful.
Get out of the house.Sitting around and dwelling on lost friends will make it harder to get over them.
Take a class.Seeking out a new hobby can be a great distraction and can help you meet new friends.
Do your favorite things.Don’t let lost friendships keep you from enjoying yourself.
Be patient.Healing from the loss of a friendship is going to take time.

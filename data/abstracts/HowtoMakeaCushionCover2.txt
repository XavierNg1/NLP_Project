Find an old t-shirt that your really love but can't wear anymore.
Cut the t-shirt.
Turn the t-shirt inside out and then sew a seam on three sides of it, the top and two sides.
Turn your shirt right-side out and then stick your cushion inside of the stomach area of the t-shirt.
Fold the bottom edge of the t-shirt fabric up and to the inside of the cushion.
Sew up the bottom edge of your pillow.
Decorate your cushion!

Compare vanilla bean flavors geographically.Though the most common vanilla comes from Madagascar, vanilla plants grow all over the world in areas close to the equator.Beans from different countries have their own distinctive flavors.
Decide which grade of vanilla bean to use.Vanilla beans fall into categories of either Grade A or Grade B. Grade A beans are "gourmet" beans — plumper, moister, and more expensive.
Make sure the beans were picked at peak ripeness.If you see little splits in the end of the bean, that doesn't mean they're dry and undesirable.
Ignore white frost or crystals.If your vanilla beans have a frosty white substance on their surface, you might think they've gone bad — but you're wrong!,
Remove the beans from the pod.Using a sharp knife, slice down the length of the vanilla pod.
Bury the seeds and pod in sugar.
Let the vanilla and sugar sit somewhere out of the way.Make sure the container is sealed tightly, then let the sugar and vanilla sit for at least 1-2 weeks.
Store your vanilla sugar appropriately.
Use your vanilla sugar.Once your sugar has taken on the vanilla's flavor, you can substitute vanilla sugar into any recipe that calls for sugar!

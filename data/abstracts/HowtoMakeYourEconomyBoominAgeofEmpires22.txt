When the game begins, there are a few steps that must be done in very quick succession:



Immediately create 4 villagers from the town center, depleting all 200 food.
When the 4 sheep arrive at the town center, have all but two of them place themselves right outside the town center, and two of them placed at the town center.
Research Loom once the four villagers have all been created.
Build a mill near the berries with one villager that is not chopping wood.
Lure boars.
Keep creating villagers until you get to 30 population.
Research the Feudal Age.

Understand that everybody in this world has sinned and fallen short of the glory of God Roman 3:23.
Hopefully, you are now crushed under God's law and see it's impossible to obey and so it's safe to continue.
Now that you know why you can't, the next thing that will help on this quest is to know why you should.
Having established the above, God knows the above and when our first parents rebelled, He promised that there was a person to come in future to destroy the Serpent (read Genesis 3!),
If you understand the above, then you should know God loves you and is your Savior.
Finally, repent of your sins and hopefully if God wills, if you believe, He would have changed your heart and you will "bear good fruit" naturally.

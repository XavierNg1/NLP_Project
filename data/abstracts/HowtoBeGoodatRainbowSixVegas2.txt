be stealthy whenever you can, use your silencer, keep your team on 'infiltrate' and set up ambushes and quick kills.
if your silencer is on then the tangos (terrorist) can't hear you unless your bullet hits something next to you.
in order to set up ambushes, you need to quietly approach 2 or more tangos with silencers on or off (your choice, i prefer silencer because of the stealth) tell your team to take cover and hold fire then you go around the tangos if possible, if not just stay with your team.
stealth kills this works with 1-4 enemies with 3 being kind of risky and 1 being safer.
in some situations you'll be forced into big battles with guns blazing.
CQB situations, in close quarters have silencers off (gives your weapon more damage and penetration)use smoke and thermal.
the explosives, smoke grenades etc.

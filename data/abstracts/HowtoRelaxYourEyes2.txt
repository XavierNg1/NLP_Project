Take a break.Especially if you do large amounts of computer work during your day, it can take a toll on your eyes.
Limit screen time.Since the main culprit for eye strain is today's culture is time spent in front of a computer, a TV, a cell phone, or another device with a screen, finding alternatives such as reading a paper book rather than reading on your iPad can be a huge help.
Wash your eyes with cold water frequently.
See a doctor.

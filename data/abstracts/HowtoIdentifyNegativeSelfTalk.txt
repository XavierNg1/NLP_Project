Identify the running commentary in your head.
Accept that your inner voice is often wrong.
Use your feelings as a cue to examine your thoughts.
Figure out if you are “filtering.” Although negative self talk can take any variety of types and topics, it usually derives from a common set of general forms.
Perceive if you are “personalizing.” Have you ever blamed yourself for the weather (“It only stormed because I wanted to go to the beach.”) or your favorite sports team’s performance (“They always lose when I watch.”)?,
Catch yourself “catastrophizing.” Do you assume that it will rain on your wedding day?,
Pick up on your habit of “polarizing.” Some people perceive themselves and the world in a strictly binary fashion — black or white, good or bad, yes or no, positive or negative, and so on.
See if you are “self-limiting.” If you make up your mind beforehand that you can’t accomplish something, you create a self-fulfilling prophecy that sabotages your chances of success.
Judge whether you are “jumping to conclusions.” This form of negative self talk is very similar to the other forms that draw from assuming the worst in a situation.
Home in on your “habits of speech.” Do you, without thinking, call yourself “stupid” under your breath when you make a mistake, or say to yourself “Good idea, fatso” when you succumb to a tempting dessert?,
Observe how you make others’ thoughts your own.
Challenge your inner voice.
Practice positive self talk.
Create a healthier environment.

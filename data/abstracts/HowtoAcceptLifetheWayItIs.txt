Ask yourself what you think about your life.
Accept that the world is confusing in many ways.
Start thinking about emotions and feelings.
Look around you.
Respect other people's points of view.
Respect the views of other creatures.
Ask yourself again if you accept life the way it is.
Try to fix your perception of society.
Try to make friends with everyone whether you like them or not.
Accept.

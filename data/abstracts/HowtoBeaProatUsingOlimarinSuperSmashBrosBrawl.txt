Understand the difference between Olimar's different Pikmin and their powers.
There may be times you need to kill off your Pikmin to get new ones.
Pikmin grow.
Olimar has many, many decent attacks.
As you know white and purple pikmin are the best ones go to the ledge and pull out pikmin if you are at the right distance from the ledge Olimar will chuck red blue and yellow pikmin off the edge and purple and white pikmin will land on the edge keep pulling pikmin up until you can't anymore.

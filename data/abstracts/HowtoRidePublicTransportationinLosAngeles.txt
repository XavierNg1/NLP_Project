Plan ahead.
Have plenty of change and one dollar bills.
If you are not certain of your destination it helps the bus operator if you know the cross streets.
Realize that the bus is a community.
As soon as you identify the bus number that you want, start to wave at the operator to let him know that you do indeed want his bus.
If you don't know the street name but recognize the general area, sit where you can see the streets.
If your eyesight isn't that good or if you want to make sure to get your stop ask the operator to call your particular street.
Do not talk to the operator too much about things not related to your destination.

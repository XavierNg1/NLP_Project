Think about whether you want to wear a one-piece or two-piece swimsuit.
Consider color/pattern.
If you're going with a one-piece:


Try to find a suit with material cut out from the sides.
If you're going with a two-piece:


Emphasize your upper half with a patterned bathing suit top.
Stand up straight and strut your stuff.

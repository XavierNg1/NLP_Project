Choose the sex of your fish.While you can add a female betta to a community with other female betta fish, it is not recommended that you keep male betta fish in the same tank as other males.
Add a curious fish.A community tank offers more opportunity for exploration and enrichment than a solitary tank.
Do not add aggressive fish to a community tank.While male betta fish, especially, tend to be very aggressive, all betta fish are solitary by nature and can be aggressive if they perceive that another fish is in their zone.

On your free time, get a small piece of paper.
Write down a question you have for someone.
Next time you see someone you kind of know, ask them one of the questions you wrote down.

,
Next time you see someone else, ask another question, or the same question you asked the first person.
Once they answer the question, respond.
Whenever there is a silent moment ask one of your questions to break the silence.

,
Once you get to know a new person, or someone you just never really know, make a new list.

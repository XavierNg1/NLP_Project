Dealing with the Environment: public transport is a tough environment.
The check out: wow!,
Positioning: no!,
Props: it's useful to have a newspaper, book or magazine in your hands, as it gives you something to pretend to look at, instead of awkwardly glancing around or staring off into space.
Eye contact: this is the best way to tell if someone finds you physically attractive.
Smile: when you catch their eye for the second time, you might feel that a smile is appropriate; it'll make you seem friendly and approachable.
Body language: body language is a great give-away for how someone feels about you.
Speaking up: now it's time to start a conversation.
However, do expect them to look surprised that you've spoken up, and be prepared to repeat the question if they are startled.
Plan B: if your nerves have got the better of you, or you're unsure if they find you attractive- there's another alternative.

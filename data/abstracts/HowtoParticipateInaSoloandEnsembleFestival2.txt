Put on your band uniform.
Get your stuff together.
When you get to the location (probably a school) where the event will take place (at least half an hour before your designated playing time), sign in to get your room information, and head to the cafeteria or other designated warm-up room to run through your music a few more times and wait for the rest of your ensemble or your accompanist to show up.
Once everyone else you need has arrived and you've warmed up for a few minutes, find your room at least 15 minutes early and wait for your turn to play.

The logic behind never changing your filter sand is that dirty sand actually filters better than brand new sand.
Removing the sand with a shop vacuum will be much easier than scooping the sand out by hand or with a small shovel.
After removing the old sand you will want to add water to the tank before adding new filter sand.
The type of sand that you add to the filter will be #20 silica sand which is specifically produced for filter media.
The amount of sand that you add to the filter will depend on the size of filter that you have.
Be sure not to get any sand into the sandpipe which will be wide open.
Once full you can put the filter head back on being absolutely certain that it is tight enough.
Once back together the first thing you need to do is give the filter a thorough backwash.

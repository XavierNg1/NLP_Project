Choose the perfect foundation.
Find the perfect colour.
Apply the cosmetics.
Having good eyebrows is the perfect way to frame your face-they don't have to be plucked or waxed.
Dab a blob of foundation onto your fingertips once the moisturizer has soaked and put a dab of it on every spot or uneven tone you can find on your face.
Look at yourself in natural light.
Take a large make-up brush and the slightest dusting of talc.
Apply a natural blusher.
Gently sweep the blusher that is left on the brush across your forehead, your nose and anywhere else to take away what can sometimes become a 'ghostly' look.

,
Choose mid browns or any other light colour that compliments your skin tone for your eyes.
Choose some eye liner and dot it onto your lower lid.
Apply mascara to your upper lashes as usual, especially in the corners.
Put on a pale shade of lipstick followed by a slick of gloss, or just the gloss will be fine.

Finished.

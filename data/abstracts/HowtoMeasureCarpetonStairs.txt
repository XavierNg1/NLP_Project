Measure the rise of 1 of the steps to be carpeted.
Use the tape measure to obtain the fall of each step.
Add the measurements of the step's rise and fall together to obtain the total length for each stair.
Count the number of steps that are exactly the same size as the step that you measured.

,
Multiply your total for the length by the number of steps that are exactly the same size.

,
Take the measurements of any steps that are a different size from the first one measured.

,
Total the measurements from all of the steps.
Obtain the measurement for width by measuring the widest step on the staircase.

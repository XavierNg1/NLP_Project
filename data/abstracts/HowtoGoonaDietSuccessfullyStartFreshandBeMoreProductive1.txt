To start fresh, first make a list in you mind or written down of all the things you don't like about yourself.
Clean your room or your house.
Have a long shower.
If you're at school, finish all your homework, even the ones due next month so you have a completely fresh start and no worries.
When you do tasks later in the week make sure you do the good ones first.

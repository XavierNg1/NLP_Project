Figure out the cause, so that you can stop it recurring after you fix it.
Set a comfortable working area - any table will do.
Place your uke on the surface, crack up.
Clean the uke.
Get your glue, whatever it is.
Apply glue to the length of the crack.
Tap the glue into the crack with your index finger.
Give the glue 10-15 seconds to soak in.
Let it rest for 15-20 minutes.
You're a happy owner of a fixed uke!

Start with a compound bow.This type of bow is much easier to use than the traditional longbow and recurve bow, which makes it perfect for a beginner.
Choose the proper orientation.Bows come in right-handed and left-handed versions.
Select the right draw weight and draw length.Draw weight, which is the weight of resistance when you pull back the bow string, must be considered.
Pick the appropriate arrows.There are two arrow types used with compound bows – aluminum and carbon.
Practice.Set up a target in your backyard (or in some other open area) to work on your aim.
Scout early.Most people do their hunting on leases, since these large areas are set aside for lawful hunting.
Place a tree stand in your chosen location.
Arrive at your deer stand before dawn.On a hunting day, you need to get settled in your stand or blind before daylight.
Be quiet and still.
Follow the blood trail and secure your kill.If you don’t kill the animal immediately, you will have to track your prey by following its blood trail.
Be prepared for field dressing.
Clean and dress your kill in the field.Field dressing involves removing the animal's internal organs.
Use rope to secure the deer for transporting.
Transport the deer to your home or camp.Once there, hang the deer up so that it isn’t touching the ground.
Clean and maintain your bow.

Assemble the items needed to make this gaff.

With the jigsaw, cut the keyhole and the slot on the side.

Use this device for landing fish that weigh more than the breaking strength of your fishing line.

To use this device, reel the fish until it is below you and slip the device over the main line.

After snagging the swivel, set your rod down and pull the fish up with the cord.

Do not use a snap swivel because it might come apart from the stress.

Pick out a bright spot for your Hoya.
Move your older plant if it has stopped blooming as much.
Water Hoya plants when the potting soil becomes almost completely dry.
Water your plant in the morning.
Pour the water evenly over the soil until it drains from the bottom of the pot.
Keep the season in mind.

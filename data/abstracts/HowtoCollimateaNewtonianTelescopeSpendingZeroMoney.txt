Prepare yourself for the collimation process.
Build your own collimation cap: pick the eyepiece's protection cap that came with your telescope, and drill a little hole in the exact center.
The first mirror to be aligned is the secondary mirror (the diagonal flat one, under the eyepiece).
In most of the cases, it's not the secondary mirror that needs to be aligned (jump to step 8).
If you're confused with all the reflections, block the primary mirror with a piece of white cardboard.
Align the secondary in the exact center of the image through the eyepiece: unscrew the three screws that lock the secondary mirror, and screw/unscrew the center screw to make the mirror go up/down.
Take the piece of white cardboard off the tube.
Now you need to align the primary mirror.
You need to center the reflection of your eye in the center of the primary mirror.
Remember: it is the image of your eye that needs to be centered in the primary mirror, not the spider!,
At this point, your scope is ready to go for deep-sky (except binary stars) and moon observing.
Most people pick a stationary bright star like Polaris to do the fine tuning.
Point your scope to your pseudo-stationary star.
You need to center this target-like image.
If you did everything right, your Newtonian telescope is now completely collimated, and you've spent absolutely zero money.

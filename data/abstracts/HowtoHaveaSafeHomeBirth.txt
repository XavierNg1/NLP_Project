Ensure that your pregnancy is proceeding normally as you approach the time for birth.
Evaluate your baby's position prior to the birth.
Consider your own health and wellbeing to see if you are a candidate for a home birth.Prior to proceeding with a home birth, it is important to ensure that you yourself do not have health concerns such as diabetes, high blood pressure, a seizure disorder, or other chronic health concerns that may increase the risk of the birth for you and/or your baby.
Select a midwife or other qualified individual to guide you through the home birth.The first step in planning a safe and successful home birth is to select a qualified healthcare professional to work with.
Select a location for the birth.Most people will choose a location in their home; the one caveat is that the location should ideally be within 15 minutes of a hospital that has 24-hour maternity care.
Choose your support team.It is important to think about who you want to have present for your baby, in addition to the healthcare professional (normally the midwife).
Decide how you want to manage your pain.Having a child can be a painful experience, yet women have a variety of opinions and personal preferences as to how they would ideally like to handle the pain.
Create a birth plan.It is important to be well-prepared and to know what to expect going into a home birth.
Understand potential emergency situations.It is important to be aware that there is a small chance that the home birth does not proceed as smoothly as expected.
Create a backup plan.
Receive follow-up care after the birth.Right after the birth, your midwife can help you to initiate breastfeeding with your new baby, after your baby has been examined by the person present who is qualified to examine newborns.

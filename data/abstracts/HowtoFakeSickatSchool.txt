Try faking a cold or flu.
Convince everyone you have diarrhea or a stomach flu.This one might be a little embarrassing, but it’s very effective if you want to go home from school.If you can deal with the awkwardness, it’s a good choice because it’s not usually challenged – if you have diarrhea, no one is going to want you around.
Pretend to have a migraine.Since migraines don’t have as many visible symptoms as other sicknesses, your acting skills will need to be very good to pull this off.
Start early in the day.
Apply pale makeup before class begins.
Don’t eat lunch and drink very little.
Move slowly and appear dazed.All sicknesses are going to slow you down and affect how quickly you are able to think.
Jump up suddenly and race out of the classroom.
Remain in the bathroom for 10 or 15 minutes.
Go back to the classroom but don’t go inside.
Whisper to your teacher what’s happening.
Look visibly upset.
Hit the bathroom again on your way to the nurse’s office.
Create your fake fever.
Don't ask the nurse to go home.
Be consistent with your symptoms and pretend to “recover.” Make sure to show a few subtle symptoms when you come back to school after being “sick.” Otherwise, your teacher will probably get suspicious.

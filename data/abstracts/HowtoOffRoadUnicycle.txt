Understand what's involved.
Make sure you have a suitable off-road unicycle.
Start easy, start slowly.
Start looking for trails in your locale.
Keep one hand hard under the seat as you learn to ride over each new texture.
Once you feel confident that you can ride and recover on a flat, rocky trail, then you are ready to tackle inclines and declines.
Keep practicing.

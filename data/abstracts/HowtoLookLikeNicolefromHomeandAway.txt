Nicole's hair is blonde.
Wear make-up.
Wear "glamorous" clothes.
If you want to take it one step further, a green cocktail dress is great for a night out.

If it gets cold, a Mongolian jacket can be worn with both outfits.
Nicole works out at the gym a lot, so get exercising!,
Don't completely push everyone away!,
Be a real girly girl.
Have fun!,
Nicole lives in Sydney, Australia, and so she speaks with an Australian accent.

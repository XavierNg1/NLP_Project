Find two pieces of material.
Cut the fabric into rectangles of the same size.
Sew the fabric together.
You now have a pouch.
Make small cuts of about 0.5 inches/1.5cm, about 1 inch/2.5cm apart.
Thread the string/ribbon through the cuts.
When you've done this, you will see that if you pull the string it will close the pouch.
Done.

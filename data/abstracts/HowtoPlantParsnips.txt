Prepare the site.
Lay a piece of string on the soil as a guide to make sure you dig the row in a straight line.
Use a cane, or other tool, to dig a narrow hole that you will place the seeds in.
Using a hoe, gently cover the seeds with soil.
If the soil is dry, water the seeds in.
To protect your plants from late frosts in Spring, build a frame to cover the drills.

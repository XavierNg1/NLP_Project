Unwrap the suit into a flat shape, preferably on grass.
Use a leaf blower to blow it up.
Take off the cap for the bubbles and put it in your left pocket.
Place the opening of the bubbles on the bottom right (if you are a righty).
Start up the leaf blower and hold it on the opening.
When it is almost done, take the cap out of your left pocket and get ready to put it on once you take the leaf blower out.
Once the cap is back on, make sure it is tight.

Suit up!

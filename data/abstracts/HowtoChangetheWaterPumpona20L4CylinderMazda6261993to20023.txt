 There or two of these cam shafts.Remove the OHC cam valve cover which is necessary to access the timing belt, the top of the timing belt sprockets, and the cam timing marks.
Do not turn the engine using the cam timing sprockets or their retaining bolts, or by pulling on the timing belt.
Align the timing marks on back of the cam sprockets lined up straight across, with a wrench on the retaining bolt of the harmonic pulley.
Work on level ground and block the wheels (so they won't roll) with bricks or wooden pieces about the size of a bricks.Loosen the right front wheel lug nuts but leave them snug ("right side" as when you are seated in the car).
Jack up that side of the car.Realize that later you will support the engine separately with a jack as explained when it is needed but you may need a different jack.
Remove the plastic splash-guard cover under the engine which extends to cover the side of the wheel well.
Support the engine securely but with just little/slight upward pressure with a "scissor jack" or "bottle jack" with a strong piece of wood (longer than a brick) to protect the engine from the jack.
Remove the plastic top half timing-cover which is held on by 4 small bolts (10mm), with one near each corner.
Remove the "harmonic pulley bolt" (21mm, 13/16 inch) that you had loosened earlier and remove the pulley.
Put the bolt back in to hold the sprocket on and be sure the sprocket "key" is always kept in its slot.
Remove the retaining screws from the lower half timing cover (10mm).Remove the lower timing cover carefully because you have to maneuver it to clear off of the sort of alignment pin-block (actually almost a little cube and is about 2cm) and is just above the crankshaft sprocket and fits into a place in the lower half cover but you can not see it until the cover is off.

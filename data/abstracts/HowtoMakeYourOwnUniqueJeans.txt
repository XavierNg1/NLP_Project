Find a black or brown pair of jeans.
Design your jeans with a single theme, color, medium and technique.
Be more specific.
Think of possible combinations of your single choices:


Embroider the back pockets and front lower legs of the black jeans in blue, using musical notes.
Change the hem.
Finished.

Create a new workbook in Microsoft Excel with 2 worksheets: Data and Saves.
Set Preferences under the Excel Menu, with Calculation - Goal Seeking Preferences being particularly important.
Click in the upper left hand corner of the Data worksheet to select the entire worksheet, between the 1 and the A, and Format Cells Font 9 or 10 if you're comfortable with that and Format Number Number Decimal Places 15. because there's a need to see that there's truly zero difference in two methods of calculating a relationship within the same group of numbers.

Set the problem out.
Set up the worksheet.
Select column A and Edit Replace Find what: a Replace with: a_ Replace All, and do this for every letter through i_ replacing i.
Next, select the column labels that are formulas and paste them into their places.
Select cell B14 and enter the formula w/o quotes "=B13-B12" and then copy this zero difference formula to beneath every formula pair you just pasted in, i,e, paste it to cell C17, D20, etc.
Select cell B1 and enter the formula note with the leading space, "Â  =B3^(1/(B3-1))", as referred to above in Step 4 as "b^(1/(b-1)) = a.",
Select cell C4 and enter 1.979 999 999 999 9, Select C3 and enter 25.
Select cell D2 and enter "=C2-B2+C2" as a simple means of decrementing.
Go to cell E2 and enter "=D2-C2+D2" as a means of decrementing.
Go to cell F2 and enter "=E2" and let's try another means of trickery.
Go to cell G4 and enter "=E2-D2+E2".
You can see the process here.

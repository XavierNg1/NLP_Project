Figure out if the bird is a nestling or a fledgling.A fledgling is a young bird that has all of its feathers, has left its nest of its own will, but its parents still feed and care for it.
Leave the bird alone, unless the bird is in immediate danger, for instance if it is exposed to predators or traffic.
Don't touch a fledgling unless you are positive that it needs help.Leave the bird alone and watch it for awhile from a distance.

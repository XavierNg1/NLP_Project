Understand what makes a table of any kind.
Begin with the top.
Build the apron using wood cut to the size you need.
Take pieces of scrap wood, approximately 1 x 2 x 6-inches (2.5 X 5.2 X 14.6 cm) and screw them onto the inside of the apron.
Make the legs from whatever material you decide on.
Attach the legs to each corner of the apron.
Turn the coffee table top upside down and put the apron, with the legs attached, on the bottom.
Sand the surfaces with progressively finer sandpaper beginning with 120-grit and finishing with 220-grit.
Apply a natural finish, which is particularly nice if you have a great grain pattern.
Apply carnauba wood wax to the surface for added protection.

Understand how you want to use the tablet.
Consider the device’s memory.
Compare displays.
Pick a size.
Establish a budget.
Consider Android tablets if price, form factor and Internet browsing are high on your list of needs.
Look at Apple if you want apps, better form-factor, sharp display and you are flexible on price.
Compare Kindle for eReaders and surfing.
Review the Microsoft tablets running Win 8.
Consider a phablet like the Galaxy Note 2 and 3 if the iPhone or Samsung Galaxy does not have enough storage, browsing power or display.
Don’t purchase a tablet between November and January.
Consider waiting three to four months after a new model comes out to purchase it.
Expect to get a bigger discount or deal on a non-Apple iPad.
Purchase a tablet direct from the manufacturer, such as Apple, Google, Microsoft or Amazon, if you want to buy the newest model on the market.
Try eBay or another auction site if you are open to purchasing refurbished tablets or models.
Shop at a cellular network provider if they are offering special financing when you sign up for a monthly plan.
Try supermarkets, like Tesco, Costco, Walmart or Argos, if you are shopping for an older model.
Go to a shop only if you want your tablet immediately.

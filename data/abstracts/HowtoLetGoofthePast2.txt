Forgive yourself.It can be tempting to hide a painful past and pretend like it does not exist.
Confess.Oftentimes, just getting something off of your chest provides the relief you need to start moving forward.
Apologize.Hurting others can cause one to feel guilty or ashamed.
Repair damages.Having unfinished business, owing debts, and other kinds of situations can be heavy emotional baggage.
Donâ€™t fear failure.No one succeeds at everything all of the time.

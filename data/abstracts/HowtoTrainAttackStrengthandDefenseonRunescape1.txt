Start killing cows.
Start training on Goblins level 2, you are 5/1 levels higher than them, and you still have food.
When you get 10 attack, purchase a black long sword.
Train on hill giants (LOBSTERS ARE SUGGESTED) Keep doing this until you reach 60 attack.
Attack experiments are useful because they have so much hp.

Keep an open mind and expect to see many changes between the comic books of years back, and those of today.
Go to the comic shop with a friend.
Realize that it's not all superheroes, spandex and capes out there, and admit that there may be more here than you originally supposed.
Start with identifying other pop culture things you like - Comics, like movies and TV shows, now come in all shapes and sizes, and can be compared to a library or stand next to your favorite films, TV and video games.
Do not limit yourself to comics in color - some of the most interesting ones are produced very inexpensively by an independent creator or small company without the vast resources of the major comic companies.
Try out different shops.

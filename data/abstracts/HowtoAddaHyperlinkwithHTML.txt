Form your HTML document with the proper HTML tags up to the point where the link needs to be added, keeping in mind that links must be seen to be able to be used effectively - so add them to the document somewhere underneath the <body> and before the </body> tags.
Form the link tag at the place where the tag will need to stand out to the reader.
Locate the place in between the two quotation marks and place your exact link URL there.
Title your link on what people should use to click on.

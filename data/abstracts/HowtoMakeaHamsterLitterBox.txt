Find a suitable box you can use.
Cut a hole the size of a paper towel or toilet paper tube on the side of the box.
Place the tube you used to cut the hole and place it in the hole to make it fit nicely.
Place some of your hamsters current bedding (some that's already in the cage) in the box so when your hamster smells it, it will recognize it.

,
Place some of your hamsters feces in the box.
Wait for the hamster to use it.
Finished.

Inspect the plant for bugs (most plants won't show bugs in the greenhouse but they will show up after about two weeks in the home).
If you want to keep over that particular plant, several applications of soapy water to the plant and potting soil should rid it of most infestations.
Place the plant in a cool (not cold) room with curtain filtered sunlight and cut back on the watering.
Decide what kind of plant you want to end up with for Christmas.
Do not set the plant in full sun at first.
Start watering regularly.
When it is time to bring the plant in for fall, start the processes of turning the top leaves red (or pink or whatever color they were last winter).

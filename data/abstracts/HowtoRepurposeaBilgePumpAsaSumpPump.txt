Determine whether you are going to use the existing outflow pipe for both pumps or add a second pipe for just the bilge pump.
Know where it needs to be installed.
Install the bilge pump in the sump.
Connect the battery, fuse, control switch (optional), bilge level control switch, and bilge pump with heavy-duty wiring.
Test the battery-only operation.
Attach the charger to the battery and plug in the charger.
Final testing should include making sure the original sump pump and the new bilge pump sequence properly and work simultaneously.Make sure all connections are taped and all wires are tied or taped and you should be done.Make sure the charger is set to automatic mode (it will maintain the battery normally but switch to charge mode if there is a draw on the battery or it is discharged after an outage).

Tie on a caddis imitation.
Position yourself slightly upstream and to the right or left of where you believe the trout are holding in the river or stream.
Make a cast across the creek or stream and allow the fly to float downstream on the opposite side of the stream from where you are standing.As the fly reaches the end of its drift and your line straightens out, you will want to raise the rod tip to upward toward the sky - but still pointing in the general direction of the fish, or where you think the fish may be holding.
As soon as the fly starts to move across the surface of the creek, you should gently shake the rod tip and try to put uniform "waves" into your fly-line.
As the fly dances across the creek, you should be ready for a trout to launch itself toward the fly.
If you do not connect with a trout, repeat the steps a few times from the same location.
If a trout does connect with the fly, there is usually no need to forcefully set the hook - the trout normally hook themselves.

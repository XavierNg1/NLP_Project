Realize that it might simply be that the person judging your work thinks everything is anime.
Look for the tell-tale signs that your work is anime: Big eyes, small nose, shiny or large hair.
If your characters have large eyes, keep them.
Go people-watching.
Instead of drawing a generic anime face shape, think of the shape of the face you want.
Get rid of that teeny-tiny nose.
Take note of the clothing.

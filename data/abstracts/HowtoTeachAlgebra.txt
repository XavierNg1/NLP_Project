Attend school district training to get copies of teaching suggestions and example assignments for the the first unit.
Use the school district's scope and sequence materials or manual which tells you what to teach and when, and how many days to spend on various topics.
Read over the publisher's similar kind of scope and sequence, which goes straight through the book and has some "extra" materials.

,
Prepare or obtain a syllabus to give to the students that covers the subject.

,
Make a lesson plan.
Teach students using algebra concepts that are well ordered and clarified.
Do not "teach the book"; rather, teach the students the key concepts and expand on them.
Lecture less, but guide and facilitate more.
Use math vocabulary all the time with some restating using simpler terms, but not just the simple words, so students will know that you think the vocabulary is important.

,
Teach algebraic thinking, using multiple representations: using patterns of growth or decay, using data, visual sketch, graphing, and expressing either a relation or a function.

,
Explore examples of math in the real world (slope, roof pitch, percent hill grades) and other of such things also in everyday life (area, volume, cubic yards of soil, sand or concrete) and in sports (statistics), math that is used for various jobs, etc.

,
Have answers when some students argue that math is useless and doesn't have anything to do with everyday life.
Motivate students to do homework, by using it as a small part of the grade.
Use “hands-on” activities planned for each major unit.
Test only what is taught.
Reteach with a review and retest if needed, but do it while trying to keep making some progress on new materials.

,
Express happiness about students' small successes when they have the "Eureka moment!",
Post just a few class rules, about 5 or 6, not twenty.
Teach classroom procedures for daily events such as roll call and tardies that do not take much time.
Calculators can be a help or a hindrance, and are useful, but some uses of the calculator are too advanced while students are learning the basic principles.

,
Check out and get back calculators which will require a carefully planned and executed system to be accountable.
Teach from bell to bell, of course that includes guided practice -- but does not mean long lectures.

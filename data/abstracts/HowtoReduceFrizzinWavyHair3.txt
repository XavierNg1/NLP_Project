Get regular haircuts.If you havenâ€™t had a haircut in a few months, you probably have split ends.
Sleep on a satin pillowcase.Cotton bed linens create friction during the night as you toss and turn.
Avoid touching your hair during the day.Tousling and running your fingers through your hair causes frizz because it disrupts the smoothness of the hair shaft.
Reduce hair washings.Natural oils from your scalp smooth and moisturize your hair, which prevents frizz.
Use a deep-conditioning mask once per week.Wavy hair tends to get dehydrated fast, which makes it prone to frizz.

Have a life outside of Facebook.
Avoid typical updates and seek the quirky instead.
Post regularly but not with such frequency that people think you're wired to Facebook.
Keep your posts short and pithy.
Compliment people.
Don't be nosy.
Don't rush to answer everything.
Write polite and thoughtful Facebook posts.
Be clear and choose your words with care.
Realize that just because you care about a cause or game, you don't have a right to intimidate people with it.
Quit whining and complaining.
Don't turn comments or messages into things they're not.
Be friendly, relaxed and true to yourself.

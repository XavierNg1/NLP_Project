So now that you have prepared your speech you have to do the difficult bit which is to deliver it.
Whilst every public speaker puts on a “persona” when they get on the podium it fits in with their personality.
To start with, simply concentrate on giving your speech, clearly and succinctly.
You need to experiment with methods of notes, and go with what feels right for you.
Always read your notes before you arrive at the venue so it is fresh in your mind which will eliminate a total reliance on notes.

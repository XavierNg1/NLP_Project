Try to be the first to set foot on the scene of a crop formation or "circle", as they were referred to early on (some of these strange formations date back to the Nineteenth Century but the current craze didn't become household terminology until about the '70s or so).
Know about what crop circles are.
Learn to distinguish between three broad classes of crop formations, they are: Melik Circles; Pictograms, and, Fractals or other very intricate and ornate Geometric Constructs.
Even before visiting the site on foot, or as shortly thereafter as humanly possible, get to high ground if any is to be found so that you can look down upon the entire design and get one or more good photographs or footage of same.
Bring the right equipment.
Take a Geiger counter out there or one of those old but tried and true radiation intensity meters such as the Victoreen Instrument CDV 715 Model 1-B like they had stored in the old bomb shelters back during the Cold War days---you can still get one on e-bay for a song.
Learn to distinguish between radioactivity and microwave radiation: radioactivity consists of rays of particles or extremely high frequency electromagnetic radiation (in the high X-ray region) from disintegrating atoms---this means alpha particles (helium nuclei); beta particles (high speed electrons) and gamma rays (electromagnetic emissions of the same or higher frequency or shorter wavelength than X-rays)...of the three, gamma is most deadly and the one to avoid.
For those so inclined and the truly dedicated, you might also take along a portable radio frequency spectrum analyzer---the purpose of this is to detect lingering microwave energy and to measure its intensity at various points within the crop formation.

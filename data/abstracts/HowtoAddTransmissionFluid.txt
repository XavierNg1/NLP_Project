Start your car.
Without actually driving the car, depress the brake and run the transmission through all the gears, including Reverse and Overdrive.
With your car parked on an even surface, open the hood and identify your transmission dipstick.
Pull the dipstick out and wipe it with a rag.
Stick the dipstick back into the transmission fluid and lift it out again for your reading.
Keep your car's engine idle with the transmission in park and the parking brake activated.
Check the owner's manual for instructions on adding the correct transmission fluid for your vehicle.
Place a funnel in the dipstick hole of the transmission.
Pour the correct fluid slowly into the transmission.
With your vehicle still idling, depress the brake and run the transmission through its gears.
Check the fluid level once more.
Return the dipstick to the transmission hole and make sure it is on tight.

Get out a deck of cards.
Each person should deal out a stack of 5 cards and put in in the middle to their right.

,
Now, each person places one card face down to the left of the stack of 5.
Each player then deals themselves a hand of five cards, and sets down the remaining 15 cards.

,
Begin playing.
As you transfer cards from your hand to the middle piles, replace them by picking up cards from the stack of 15 leftover cards.
If neither of you can place a card on the pile, take one from the stack of 5 next to each middle pile, flip it over, and keep playing.

,
When you run out of cards to play, slap the smaller pile.
Keep playing until one player has no cards left.

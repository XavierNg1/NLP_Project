Be sure that your scope is mounted properly.
Know your rifle.
Most eyepieces have a lock ring.
Adjust the objective for infinity (very far, often a small 8 symbol).
Point the scope toward a blank wall or the sky.
Once the eyepiece has a sharp reticle image, lock the eyepiece adjustment with the lock ring.
Adjust the objective.
You should now be able to move your eye from side-to-side while the rifle stays still and the cross-hairs of the reticle should not move on the target.

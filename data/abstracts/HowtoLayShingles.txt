Size your shingles appropriately.
Lay a starting row at the bottom of the roof along the edge.
Lay the first row of shingles directly covering the narrow starter row.
Lay the second row of shingles.
Shingle around stacks, vents and chimneys as necessary.
Interlace the flashing around the chimney with the rows of shingles.
Bring the ridge edges together with a ridge-capping layer.
Understand the basic patterns.
Stagger each course to achieve the half pattern.
Consider four and five inch offsets for added protection.
Consider "racking" shingles until you reach the top on each side.

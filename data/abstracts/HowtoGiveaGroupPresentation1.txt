Stay calm.
Be audible.Project your voice to the back of the room to make sure everyone can hear you.
Dress the part.Some group presentations require little in the way of wardrobe adjustments.
Use your hands to emphasize key points.For instance, when insisting that the internet is “the greatest tool” in the hands of today’s historians, lightly bring your hand down on the lectern when you intone each of the three words.
Use props.
Use a story in your presentation.Listing fact after fact in a dry way can bore both you and your audience.
Adopt a conversational style.
End with a strong conclusion.

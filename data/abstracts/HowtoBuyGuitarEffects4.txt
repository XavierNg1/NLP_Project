Reverb is the most natural of effects.
Reverb thickens up your sound, softens the edges, and makes it sound like you're playing in a large hall (or a bathroom or stairway).
Echo (also called long delay) is a natural effect as well, but it can only be encountered in large spaces such as canyons or maybe a large, empty stadium.

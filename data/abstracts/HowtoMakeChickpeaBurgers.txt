In a food processor, blend chickpeas, yoghurt, curry powder, breadcrumbs & the egg until well combined.
Transfer to a bowl, add herbs and spring onions and season well with salt and pepper.
Make the paste into burgers, balls, sausages or patties and put aside on a lined tray.
Heat a frying pan (preferably non stick, but not essential), with 1 tablespoon of oil.
When the pan is hot enough to fry, add your burgers or patties.
Serve and enjoy.
Finished.

Ideally, choose a time shopping when the children will be well rested, fed, and you will not be pressed for time.
Make a shopping list.
Make a shopping list for your child too.
When at the store, briefly but clearly go over expected behavior and what they can do to help.Tell the children which store you are going to and that you will be buying the groceries.
Pick a sage cart.
Assign older children to a job you think is special enough for them to do.
Be Efficient.
Be Educational.
Thank your Children.

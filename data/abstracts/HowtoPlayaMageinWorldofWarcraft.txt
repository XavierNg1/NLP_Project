Decide what role you want to play as a mage.
Choose your race!,
Name your mage!,
Start leveling your mage!,
Make lots of friends!,
"Spec" into talent points focusing on damage dealing (as opposed to mana-conservation or utility).
Focus on killing quantity over quality for leveling.
Pick your primary professions!,
Once you hit your level-goal, work to obtain the equipment you require for your goal, don't be greedy, the first time you see an item drop WILL NOT be the last time, so be generous, even if you don't get that particular item you want, there's always more waiting.
Now go do what you originally set out to do when you started playing!,
Join a guild, if you want to raid end-game content, this will be necessary.
Once you've done what you set out to do, congratulate yourself!,
Pick new goals, or pick a new game!,
Buff yourself with Arcane Intellect and Ice Armor.
Fill your mana and health bars.

,
Cast Mana Shield.
Mount up!,
Aggro two to ten(The amount you can aggro increases with your level) mobs and run them to a clear area.

,
Dismount, and immediately cast Frost Nova.
Run to about 30 yards (27.4Â m) from the farthest mob you pulled.
Cast Improved Blizzard.

,
Cast it again, if the mobs are far enough away.

,
Cast Cone of Cold if the mobs are too close.

,
Run around the group and cast Arcane Explosion a few times.
Now experiment with what spells you prefer, Flamestrike is very useful, as is an occasional direct damage spell if one mob resisted your AoE.

,
Frost mages need to keep the enemy slow at all times, cone of cold, imp.
If you are a Fire mage, use Pyro, then spam Fireball with occasional Fire blast.
Run from an aggro'ed mob.

,
Jump into the air.

,
While in the air, use the mouse to turn your character at least 180 degrees around.

,
Cast a Cone-of-Cold or another insta-cast, such as fireblast or ice lance.

,
Rotate 180 degrees again so you face straight forward.

,
Land on the ground.

,
Keep running.

Here are some notes that you will need to know about when playing as a mage in a dungeon.
Here are some important notes to know about.
Back to the original notes:

At other times the tank or a hunter may pull a group, and the mage will need to sheep their target as it is running toward the tank.

Decide on a filing system.
Fill your file drawers with hanging folders.
Sort your papers into piles by category.
Place each pile into a manila folder and label it clearly.
Place the manila folders into the hanging folders.
Label the hanging folders with the same names as the manila folders.
Place a supply of hanging and manila folders near the files so you can easily add a folder if you find yourself with a piece of paper that doesn't belong to an existing folder.
At the end of the year, remove all the folders, label fresh manila folders with the same category names and place them in the files.

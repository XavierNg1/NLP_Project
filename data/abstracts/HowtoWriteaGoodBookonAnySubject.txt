An extra tip to those who intend to write a visual book of, for example: tutorials: Make sure that a drawing is not only the result that you wish is drawn on the paper, but also what most people do wrong when drawing ...... (whatever the subject).
After a short bit of theory, you first draw what most people (tend to)draw, after that how you start making it look real, and after a few of those drawings: what/how you should draw.

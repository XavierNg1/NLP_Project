The best thing you can do is start by practicing your strength to build up for it.
Practice sprints to wear you down.
Put up a cone or obstacle pretending it's a defender and practice charging, driving, stuttering, and dribbling around it to take shots.
With the cone as well, try doing fake pumps and drives or fake passes and shoot.
Get a few steps away from the basket, nearly beneath it, and practice pushing up with one hand in the correct form (basketball on the tips of your fingers, hand flat and back, push up straight and flick your wrist to "reach into the cookie jar).
Don't forget to practice wide corner shots, side shots, three points, and from different locations.
Practice dribbling around for 15-30 minutes a day.
Go to something relaxing like yogaâ€”even kids can do it.
Work with a friend.
Join a team.
Have fun!

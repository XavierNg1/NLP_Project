Inspect the transformer visually.
Determine the wiring of the transformer.
Identify the transformer inputs and outputs.
Determine the output filtering.
Prepare to measure the circuit voltages.
Confirm the proper input to the transformer.
Measure the secondary output of the transformer.
Understand the root of the problem.
Observe replaced transformers.
Verify the condition of external fuses, if necessary.
Check for overdraw on your secondary.
Remove inputs and outputs to determine the source of the failure.

Have an idea for your topic.
Research it!,
Practice, practice, practice!,
While presenting in class, be sure to have picked out a few friends, or at least nice people, to look at.
Be calm and confident.when presenting from time to time look over your Q-Cards so you can see the audience, it will improve your grade ( if nervous about looking at them look at the wall behind them)

Gather your materials.
Cut off a piece of the sponge about the width of the pen.
If the sponge has an abrasive side for scouring (like a Scotch-Brite sponge), cut or tear it off.
Wash and dry the sponge.
Remove the plastic tip and the interior of the pen--the ballpoint tip, the ink reservoir, and spring if it is a click pen.
Insert the sponge into the pen.
Leave about 1/4-1/8 of an inch of the sponge sticking out of the pen.
Hold your stylus near the tip for it to work.Your fingers need to be touching the base of the pen that is in contact with the sponge.

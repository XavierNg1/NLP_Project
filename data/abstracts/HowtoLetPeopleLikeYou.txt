Consider what has caused you to cease trusting people.
Think about the ways you have developed your defense mechanisms.
Be careful if you generalize about the "whole world".
Determine whether you have tried hard to "convert" the wrong sorts in the past.
Learn to spot the people who make you feel rejected, unwanted and unhappy.
Work on letting people like you.
Be a good listener.
Tell people they matter.
Join in with things.
Be confident.
Let go of the need for equal feelings.

Understand why you need to improvise.
When you start off in the challenge, go opposite of the actually route as if you were going off road.
Try not to brake or slow down.
When you cut through trees when you go off road through your improvised route, try to drive through the open space through the trees so you can successfully make your route and beat the challenge.

Decide how big you want your wall collage to be.
Figure out what to put on it.
Before you can even start you need to have material to put on your wall.
Sort them into piles.
It's easier if you have a base point on your wall to put the things around.
After you have stuck all the bigger things on, start using the smaller images to fill in the small gaps.
Do not get frustrated if you don't fill the wall immediately.

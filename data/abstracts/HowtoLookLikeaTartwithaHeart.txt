Hair:


Your hair should ideally be long, (or at least past the shoulders), straight and glossy.
Skin:


Keep your skin spot free and healthy looking.
Eyes:


The key to this look is dramatic eye make up – even in the daytime.
Eyebrows:


Keep your eyes brows plucked at all times, make sure they are quite short and very thin.

,
Lips:


You should be aiming for plump, glossy, lips that look oh-so kissable.
Nails:


These should be quite long, but not look like talons, and should be filed into a squoval shape (square with rounded corners).
Piercings:


Always wear earrings; if you don’t have pierced ears, use clip-ons.
Underwear:


Make sure you wear nice undies at all times, even if you've got no-one to see them.
Tops:


Wear low-cut, revealing tops and corsets, preferably with spaghetti-thin or no straps, that show off your bust, shoulders and arms, look for ones with lace detail around the cleavage area.
Skirts/trousers:


Skirts are the best choice, and for this look you can wear just about any style you want as long as your skirt is super short and shows off your legs.
Shoes:


Always wear high heels, choose platforms if you can’t balance in stilettos.
Coats:


Wear short coats that finish at your waist, and make sure they are relatively tight fitting so you can still show off your figure whilst keeping warm.
Accessories:


With jewelry silver is the way to go!

Form your own ideas about where the tendency to overdo parenting comes from.
Change your perspective.
Stay away from Alpha moms.
Stop being a helicopter mom.
Let your kid get muddy, dirty, wet, and yes, pooey even.
Ditch Baby Mozart.
Cull the toy collection.
Restrain yourself from overloading the kids' after-school curriculum.
Expect self-responsibility from your children and trust that they'll be OK.
Expect your husband or partner to pick up some of the slack.
Chill and stop feeling guilty.

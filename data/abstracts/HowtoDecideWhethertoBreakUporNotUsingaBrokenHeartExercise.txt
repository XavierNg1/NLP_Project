Draw a broken heart on a piece of paper.
Think of all the things you like about this person.
Think of the bad things about this person.
Look at how many stitches or other items you have left after going through the list of likes and dislikes.
Realize that this is just a fun test, not a foolproof method of guessing what is best.

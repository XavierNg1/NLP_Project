In the beginning of your bodyboarding career, you're going to want to keep in mind that this is a sport, it takes time to develop a familiarity with the water.
After you have the right view of what you're going to be dedicating yourself too, you need to also keep in mind this sport is very physically demanding!,
Now before just running out into the water with your new sponge, make sure that you have the right size of board for your body type!,
Ok, so you got your board, you're ready to work out, next what you're going to need is fins.
So you've got all the gear!,
Once you've spent a couple minutes analyzing the water, you're going to adjust your leash to your arm, and walk out holding onto your fins in one of your hands, once the water is up to about knee high, put on the fins and start paddling out.
Prepare for a wave you aren't ready for.
Ok!,
To go right, move your body to the inside (right) edge of the board and apply pressure with your right hip to the back edge.

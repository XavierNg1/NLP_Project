Work out how much you plan to use your phone.
Take a look at each network's offer of prices, some are cheaper for texts and some favour phone calls.
Once you have decided what network you want, you should begin to compare the various price plans.
Before you go any further: Do not look at handsets in other networks that aren't available to your network.
Think of how you will use your phone and the tools you would like on your phone, e.g.
Look on the network's website, browsing through the phones that you would like and the phones that are available based on the contract or calling plan you want.

Build three more body rows identically to the first.
Make two more legs the same way you made the first two.
Add two more body beads, to make the base of the tail (identical to the neck).
Slide the first tail bead on the left string, thread the right string through the opposite side, and pull.
Tie a double knot at the end of the tail to keep the beads in place.

Memorize the list above.
Since the numbers and the objects rhyme, you can create your own number objects for numbers eleven and up.
Take the list of things you need to memorize and picture each item in your mind with the number objects.
Try to recall these things fifteen minutes later by thinking of a number, that number's object, and then the thing you are trying to remember (which is associated with then number object).

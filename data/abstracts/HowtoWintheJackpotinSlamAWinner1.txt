See which type of Slam-A-Winner the game is.
Examine how fast the turntable spins, and how long it takes the ball to drop.
Learn what it means, for when and if the ball drops and bounces off the right side of the yellow ring surrounding the Jackpot hole.
Be careful, occasionally the sensor that detects what hole the ball drops in may become misaligned, and probably out of sync for a game or two.
Take note that occasionally, if the counter in charge of spitting out the correct number of tickets is counting too slow (this happens very rarely, and varies by the machine), it could end up giving you more tickets than what was supposed to be given from a normal counter.
Don't continue playing, if you use these tricks correctly, and win a Jackpot.

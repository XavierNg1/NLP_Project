Use a lot of body contact, but be subtle about it.
Don't let your opponent into the paint!,
Once your opponent is outside of the key, body him up at an off angle.
Steal the entry pass.
If the entry pass is successful, get between your man and the basket.
Read his bumps and make sure that you bump him at the same time that he bumps you.
When it looks like he is going to jump into you, go "straight up and down" so that you don't get called for a foul.
If he hooks you, this is a foul.
If he uses a drop step, your only hope of legal defense is to block his shot.

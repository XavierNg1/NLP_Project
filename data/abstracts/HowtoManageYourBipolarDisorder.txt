Get your diagnosis firm and get settled on your meds.
Find out about bipolar: this includes not only the medical stuff but read about other people's stories.

,
Get to know your cycles and your episodes.
Keep a journal or some type of "log" that can help you figure out just when you might be able to expect to shift.
In your journal, note down for these changes that occur when you are beginning to get ill.
Make a plan to cover all the following:


triggers
mood, activity & thinking changes: early and late in the illness
strategies to stop the illness early or stay safe late in the illness
plans to protect work, money, education, relationships and your children, if any.
Focus on your life in the mainstream whether you are working, volunteering, parenting or whatever.
For anyone who has the disorder or knows someone with it - it is important that you read up on the medical information out there on it because it explains so much!,
Eventually it's better if you can accept that you have bipolar disorder and that this is something you have to deal with.
To those of you close to a bipolar person, the best thing you can do is try to ride their waves as best as you can while getting on with your own life!,
An online course on living well with bipolar will be available in January 2010 at BeatBipolar.

Pound the chicken breasts with a meat mallet inside a large, plastic, zippered bag.
Consider brining boneless, skinless chicken breasts.
Preheat your oven to 450째F (230째C).
Arrange the chicken breasts in a large baking dish.
Brush both sides of each breast with olive oil, then rub both sides with your seasoning.
Bake the chicken for 15 to 18 minutes, or until a cooking thermometer reads 170째F (77째C).
Take the chicken out of the oven, and let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes.

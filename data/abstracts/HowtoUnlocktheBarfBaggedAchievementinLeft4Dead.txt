Play in a Versus match, where two teams will take turns in playing the survivors and horde, trying to out do each other in points.
Wait until your team has its' turn as the horde.
Get to a secure space, away from the survivors, when you spawn as a boomer.
Wait until all four survivors are clustered together, aim and then vomit on them by pressing and holding the Right Trigger and Left Joystick.
Check your Xbox 360 gamerscore and achievement statistics if you're successful and you will see that the Barf Bagged achievement has been unlocked for 20 gamerscore.
Try again if you missed the first time.

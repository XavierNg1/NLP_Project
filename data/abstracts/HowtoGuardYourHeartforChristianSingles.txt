Don't start to date until you are ready to get married.
Don't have sex outside of marriage.
If you are in a relationship but you know it won't work out, don't put off breaking it off.
To avoid getting too physical and letting someone into your heart too much, try to only date in public places.
Keep your guard up when you are around your date.
Have Boundaries, with the other person and with yourself.
Beware of watching too many romantic movies or listening to love songs when you are dating a prospect.
Introduce the person to your parents, and see what they think.
Lastly, don't have an overly long engagement, if your plan is to marry.

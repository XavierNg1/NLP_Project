Gain access to and learn the proper safe use of a metal lathe in proper running order and good condition.
Familiarize yourself with the parts of the lathe and common terminology.
Select a piece of aluminum stock that has about a quarter inch of extra metal on either side when sized up to your finger.

,
Insert the piece of stock into the chuck.
After chucking up and testing for wobble, select a tool bit for parting.
Once locked and ready activate the lathe, running at a relatively slow speed, slowly feed the cutting bit into the stock and proceed slowly with the parting operation.
Prepare for truing.
If your lathe has an automated feed mechanism, set the tool bit to travel down the stock at a set, smooth speed.
After surfacing the metal, make designs in the metal by manipulating the tool bit on the metal creating grooves, rough spots, or knurling (this requires a specialized tool bit that creates the diamond pattern seen on many tool handles to improve grip and feel).
Find a drill bit that has a shank that is approximately the size of the desired finger.
Move the tool-holding assembly away from the end of the workpiece, but don't run it into the chuck.
Run the bit slowly inward until the desired depth is reached; it should be enough for at least two rings of the size that you want.
Loosen the tailstock and slide it to the end of the rail or remove it to get it out of the way.

,
Get the bit you used to perform the initial parting operation and position the bit on center line of the workpiece.
Once the ring(s) is cooled, use sandpaper or emery cloth to remove any burrs or to smooth the inside of the ring.

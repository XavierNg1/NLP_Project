 Break down the trapezium into two triangles.
Find the values for a{\displaystyle a}, b{\displaystyle b}, and c{\displaystyle c} for both triangles A and B where a{\displaystyle a}= the included angle of the sides a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}, b{\displaystyle b}= one of the two sides that you know, and c{\displaystyle c}= the other side that you know.
Use the formula A=bc/2(sinâˆ—a){\displaystyle A=bc/2(sin*a)} to calculate the areas of the triangles.
Add the areas for the triangles A and B.

Decide what type of hamsters you want.
Get a male and female.
Look for hamsters that are in good health.
Buy two large cages for your hamsters.
When you bring each of your hamsters home, allow it at least a day alone.
Wait until the female is in heat.
Put the female into the male's cage.
Isolate your female hamster once the mating is over.
Wait.
Look for the babies.
Allow the mother to nurse for three weeks without any disturbance, not even cleaning the cage.
Wait three and a half weeks.

Start with some texturizing spray.
Give your hair some volume and texture if it is straight.
Pull your hair back into a ponytail and secure it with a hair tie.You can make the ponytail as high or as low as you want, but it will look best if it is at about ear-level.Also, try to use a hair tie that matches your hair color.
Take a small section out hair from under your ponytail.
Wrap the hair around the base of your ponytail to conceal the hair tie, then secure it with a bobby pin.
Tease your ponytail.
Loosen the hair around your forehead and temples.
Set the style with a light-hold hairspray.Don't smooth the hair wisps down, however; you want the final look to be textured and a little messy.

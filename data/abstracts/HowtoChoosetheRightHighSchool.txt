Think about what you want in your high school.
Consider where your friends are going, but don't let it dictate your whole decision.
Discuss your choices with your parents.
Don't leave a tour wishing you asked something.
Don't rule out a school for one thing.
When you go on a tour, ASK QUESTIONS!,
Try to imagine yourself going to school here every day.
Talk to your parents (or your children) and let them know how you feel about the school.
If there is little in the way of schools in your area that offer the subject you want, consider learning by distance or look at other ways to do the things you like, such as after school programs and clubs.

Make new friends, but remember your old ones.

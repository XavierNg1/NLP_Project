Start with "Palms Up to Heaven": From a standing position, keep both of your arms straight as you raise them above your head.
"Draw the Bow":Â From a standing position, lower into a squat until your knees bend to around 90 degrees.
Do "Separating Heaven and Earth": From a standing position, raise your left arm at full extension sideways up towards the air (again as if you are reaching something).
Try the "Wise Owl's Gaze": From a standing position, look to your left with your head so your chin and shoulder are in line.
Move on to "Sway the Head and Shake the Tail".
Do the "Clenched Fists and Angry Glare": With legs a fair distance apart, punch straight forward with the right and left arms alternately and repeat.
Try the "Two Hands Hold the Feet": With legs straight, bend down and clasp your ankles with your two hands.
Finish with "Bounce on the Toes."

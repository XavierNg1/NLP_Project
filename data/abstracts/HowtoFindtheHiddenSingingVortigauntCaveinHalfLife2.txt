Load the Half Life 2 campaign chapter Water Hazard and play it through until the final battle with the hunter-chopper where it is dropping bombs and shooting at your airboat.
Move towards the water gate with the exploding barrels in the water before it, directly after the you destroy the hunter-chopper, and open it via the platform beside it.
Go straight through the gate with your airboat until you see two sewer outlets in the valley wall directly in front of you (they aren't far away).
Park your airboat underneath the left, open outlet.
Climb up through the bent metal grating and move into the sewer slightly.
Sprint directly down the sewer without stopping.
Turn left through a gap in the sewer before you reach the end.
Continue forwards into the vortigaunt's cave.
Check your Xbox 360 gamerscore and achievement statistics (if you are playing on the Xbox 360) and you will see that the Vorticough achievement has been unlocked for 13 gamerscore.
Collect any of the health and rechargersÂ  lying around before leaving the cave.

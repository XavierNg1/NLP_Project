Win by making every shot "around the world"before everyone else.
Select your "world spots" before the game starts.
Choose who goes first.
Shoot from the first spot.
Skip your second shot to stay in place, especially if you're worried about missing.
Keep shooting until you miss twice or skip a turn.
Allow everyone the same number of rounds to shoot.

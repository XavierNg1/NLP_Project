If it is your first ever lesson, don't worry about buying jodhpurs and a hat.
If you need a hat, go to a reputable saddlers or tack shop.
Get the right boots for your type of riding.
Buy some jodhpurs.
If you want, you can also buy a body protector or a safety vest.These are good for jumping, cross country and riding unpredictable horses.
The next thing to buy is gloves!

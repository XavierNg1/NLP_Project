Get some free software to figure out the box size.
Type a speaker's details into the software.
See if the software recommends a vented design or not.
Figure out how big a box you will be happy with.
Use the software to show you how the speaker will perform in your maximum sized box.
Set the box's tuning frequency up, so that the line representing your speaker stays between 0 dB and -3dB for as long as possible towards the left (lower frequencies and therefore bass.),
Figure out the sized panels you will need to make a box from particle board or Medium Density Fiber fiberboard (MDF) 18mm thick or more should be fine.
Glue (use pva wood glue in large quantities) and screw your sub together.
Cut holes for the speaker, the vent (make sure the end inside the box will be 1 vent diameter from everything), and the amplifier.
Launch yourself at the box with the PVA glue again, this time on the inside.
Attach some plush carpet or proper speaker 'acoustic wool' (resembling the inside of a synthetic doona) to at least two walls of the box.
Screw in the components and connect the speaker to the amplifier.

,
Use a long 'RCA' lead to connect the input on the plate amplifier to the .1 output on your home theatre amplifier.
Listen for problems.
Read some kind of home theatre magazine on how to set up a subwoofer in a room.

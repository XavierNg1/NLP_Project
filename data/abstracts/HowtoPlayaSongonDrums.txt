Find an easy song.
Grip your sticks between your thumb and forefinger, using your other fingers as support.
Put your headphones on and press play on your CD or MP3 player.
Clap along normally to the rhythm while keeping your bass-drum rhythm going.
Add the hi-hat by playing every time the guitar is strummed.
Play with all four limbs together through the entire song.

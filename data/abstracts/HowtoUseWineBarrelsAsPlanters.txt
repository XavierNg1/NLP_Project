Place your wine barrel upside down on a sturdy work surface and drill 7-1” holes in the bottom of the barrel.
Cut a piece of landscape cloth slightly larger than the inside diameter of the barrel and place it on the bottom, making sure it completely covers the surface.
Fill the barrel with the growing mix, leaving the top 2” free.
Before planting, make an arrangement by placing your plants in the most suitable spot in the container.
Water your freshly planted barrel until you see water flow freely from the bottom.

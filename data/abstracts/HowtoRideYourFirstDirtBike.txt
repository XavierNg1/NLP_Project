Put on a helmet.
Make sure you have proper positioning.
Get acquainted with the "feel" of the ride.
As you are riding, without moving your head or eyes, determine if you can see your front fender using your peripheral vision.
Master acceleration.
Make smooth and quick shifts.
Brake properly.
At first, simply accelerate to 3rd or 4th gear and then brake to a stop.
Try to “feel” when a tire is about to lock up.
Remember how the condition of the trail affects accelerating and braking.

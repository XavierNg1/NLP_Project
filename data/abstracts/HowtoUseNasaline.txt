Into 1 cup of warm (body temperature), sterilized or distilled water, stir to dissolve ½ teaspoon of salt (or 1 package of Nasaline salt).
Leaning over a basin (e.g. bathroom sink or tub), place the applicator’s silicone tip against the nose so that it completely seals the nostril.

,
As you slowly and evenly push the saline solution up into the nostril, breathe normally (or say aaahhh) through the mouth, refraining from swallowing.
Repeat for your other nostril.
Blow your nose gently to clear any remaining solution and mucus.
Clean your Nasaline.

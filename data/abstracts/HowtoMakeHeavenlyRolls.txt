Scald the milk over medium high heat.
Stir the yeast & sugar into the milk.
If you are kneading by hand, add the remaining 2 1/2 cups flour and mix until the dough is slightly firmer but still soft and smooth.
Fill a bowl with hot water, pour it out, and dry it- this ensures that the cold won't kill your yeast.
Lightly flour two baking sheets.

,
Turn the dough out onto a well- floured surface, divide it in half and roll each half into a circle that is 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) thick and 16 inches (40.6 cm) in diameter.
Roll the triangles up, starting at the wide end, to form crescent shapes.

,
Place the rolls on the prepared baking sheets, leaving two inches between them and tucking the tails under the rolls.
Heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees C).

,
Bake the rolls on the center rack until they are golden, about 25-30 minutes.
Finished.

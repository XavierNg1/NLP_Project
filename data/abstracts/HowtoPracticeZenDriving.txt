Take your time.
Sync in with the flow of traffic.
Turn off the radio, turn on your favorite music.
Breathe deeply.
Loosen up.
Instead of squandering your consciousness on greater speed, observe your surroundings.
Be thankful.
Respond to road rage with compassion.
Practice kindness.
Try hypermiling.

Work out your layout.
Consider the shape of the room as to your purposes.
Ensure there is access to water and drains in this room if you intend to make an indoor greenhouse.
Aim to ensure that your space is attractive but also hygienic if you want to have many plants.
Remove any existing benches made of woods (sealed & polished hardwoods are OK however) and laminates or anything that may possibly harbour fungus.
If it has a window, this can be a large advantage, but it should have a double glazing to protect from temperature change.
When the room is empty and is of a suitable well lit and warmed environment, consider on your space and style.

,
Choose rich colours, polished woods, fabrics and brass as other large decorative tropical-zone influenced things you may have.
If you took over an unused bathroom, then it is useful to upgrade the sink into a smart looking basin for cleaning use as it won't detract from the rest of the room.
Consider how the plants will live.
Install your plants and potting arrangement, evaluate if it looks good and adjust to suit according to practical and good hygiene needs.

Now its just continued maintenance and enjoyment.

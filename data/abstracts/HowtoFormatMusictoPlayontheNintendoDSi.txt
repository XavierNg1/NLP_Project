In case you haven't done so already, make sure you have your SD card and music files ready.
Because we don't want to change any of the files we are converting from, we'll need to Create a folder that will hold the DSi-formatted songs we'll be converting to.
Get a copy of the fre:ac Audio Encoder from their website.
Install and run fre:ac.

,
Before we load the songs, we need to set the program up so that it will convert to the format the DSi reads:


Open the settings window by selecting "General Settings" from the Options menu on the menu bar.
Now that the settings are right for the DSi, you're going to have to give BonkEnc the files to convert, this is done by filling the job list.
Once your job list is ready, click the round play button to start formatting your music, or you could use "Encode | Start encoding" from the menu bar.

Wait for your music to convert.Copy the converted music folder to SD card if you didn't convert it directly to the SD card

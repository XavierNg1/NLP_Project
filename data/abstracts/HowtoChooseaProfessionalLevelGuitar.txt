Realize that you need a professional level instrument.
A lutherie guitar is ALWAYS better than a standard guitar.
Shop around.
Research brand names and models that you think are good enough.
Read some customer reviews on larger marketing sites such as Musician's Friend or Harmony Central.
Narrow your choices down.
Consider a custom or one-of-a-kind instrument from several independent luthiers or factories, such as Heritage.

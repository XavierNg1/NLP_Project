The first and possibly most important step in the construction of reclaimed wood furniture is the choice of the wood, and the style of construction.
Always kiln dry reclaimed barn lumber (or any lumber for that matter).
If you do not have access to a Kiln then you can air dry the lumber by stacking it on the 1x1 sticks in an area with decent air flow.
Begin construction of the furniture.
Metal detect the lumber.
Rough mill the lumber is the next process.
After your reclaimed lumber is dimensioned (edge joined, and planed to size), you can now start assembly by edge gluing your boards together for the given panels you will need.
Begin final assembly.
After sanding and final assembly, the finish work can take place.

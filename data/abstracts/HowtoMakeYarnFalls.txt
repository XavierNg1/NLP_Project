Select your yarn, size, and if you want a pair of falls or just one (single falls tend to be thicker).
Make or find something to use as a frame.
Take the end of the yarn.
Slide the yarn off the frame, holding it from the opposite side you started and ended on.
Cut the end that isn't tied off.
Take a small section of yarn (4-6 strands approximately) and tie it in a larkshead knot knot around the hair tie, and tighten it as much as you can.
Optional.
Now, to wear them.
Take your falls and fit the elastic over the bun.
If you're gonna be active (such as dancing), secure them with hairpins or clips.
Look awesome, have fun, and don't worry about getting fired for dress code violations the next day.

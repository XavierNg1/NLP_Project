Keep your equipment in good working order.
Purchase your seeds.
Chose a specific plant variety that is acclimated to your growing region and conditions, and suits your taste.
Prepare the soil for planting.
Select the plates you will need to plant with.
Place your seeds in the seed boxes (the hoppers that hold them until the plates dispense them into the furrows).
Test the seed placement spacing after you install the correct plates.
Align your tractor on the rows you are going to plant.
Drop the planters to the correct depth for the row openers and de-clutch your tractor.
Stop after the first few feet to make sure each of the row openers are at the same depth, and that they are covering the seeds correctly.
Run your tractor at a modest uniform speed.
Lift the planters up with the three point lift before turning around at the end of the row.
Continue planting until you are finished, checking occasionally to ensure the row openers are clear, there are seeds left in the seed box, and the chains and plates are operating freely and smoothly.

Clean the seed boxes out and lubricate the drive chains when the planting operation is complete.

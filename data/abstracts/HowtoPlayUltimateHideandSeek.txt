Wait until it's very dark outside.
Decide where you want to go.
Divide your group of people into three even groups.
Take a head count of the hiders and the seekers so nobody gets lost!,
Tell the seekers to put on Glow-in-the-Dark hats, headbands, or bright shirts and stack several Glow-in-the-Dark bracelets on both arms.
For hiders, dress in dark clothes and pull back your hair.
Explain the rules.
Play twice more or until everybody gets a chance to be a hider, if they want to.

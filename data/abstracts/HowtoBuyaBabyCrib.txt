Find a reputable store where you can go look at cribs.
Decide what bells and whistles matter to you:


Convertible cribs can be converted to bigger beds later.
Figure out which cribs you like best in your price range.
Check the CPSC site to see if there are any recalls for cribs by your maker.
Go back and buy the crib on your second trip and don't look back.

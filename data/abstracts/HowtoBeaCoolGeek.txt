Take pride in whatever your particular interest is.
Don't worry about fitting in.
Keep your usual habits, etc.
What you wear does not judge who you are, switch your style up one day.
Never believe what others say about you.
Be open.
Wear your flash drive.
If you wear glasses, don't wear huge ones or ugly skinny ones.
You can do really whatever you want with the bottoms but DO NOT wear ripped jeans unless they are just at the knee!,
Be good with computers.
Don't change your personality though.

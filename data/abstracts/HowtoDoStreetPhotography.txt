Use digital, if at all possible.
Get your lens.
Find out your camera's hyperfocal distance.
If you are using a wide angle lens, try pre-focusing.
Decide if you are going to be up front and let everyone know you are photographing or if you want to be sneaky about it.
Don't just sit down.
Pay attention to how other's feel about you photographing them and just photographing.
Do your best to blend in.

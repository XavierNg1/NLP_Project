Rabbit breeding stock can be obtained from many different sources.
Get the right pen.
Know that female rabbits will conceive at any time they have an "encounter" with a buck.
The pen should be furnished with clean water each day.
Feed a good quality hay.
Hay should be contained in a lattice manger, or rick to keep it from being contaminated by the animal's waste.
Another feeding option can be to use calf manna along with rabbit pellets, or "rabbit food".

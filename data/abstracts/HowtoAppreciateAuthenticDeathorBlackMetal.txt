Start at the beginning.
Listen.
Do your research.
Remember that artistic, high quality music is never fully understood and appreciated at first listen.
Read the lyrics.
Learn about your roots.
Buy albums.
Ignore fashion and trends.
Transcend aesthetics.
Don't "support the underground.",
Live a Healthy Lifestyle.
Finally, do what you can to push the genre ahead.

Preheat your oven to 400°F (205°C).
Soak the bread in the milk for about 4 minutes, or until it is soft.
Cook the pancetta, onion, and garlic in a large skillet with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then let it cool slightly.
Take the bread out of the milk, and squeeze it.
Combine the lightly-beaten with the ground chicken in a large bowl.
Add 1 tablespoon of tomato paste, the onion mixture, the soaked bread, and the parsley.
Roll the mixture into 12, evenly-sized balls.
Arrange the meatballs on a baking sheet or in a roasting dish.
Mix the rest of the olive oil and tomato paste, then brush it over the meatballs.
Bake the meatballs for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are cooked through.
Serve the meatballs while they are still hot.

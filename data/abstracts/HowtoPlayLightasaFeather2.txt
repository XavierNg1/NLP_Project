Prepare to lift again.
Place your hands over the head of the person being lifted.
Repeat in unison, "Light as a feather, stiff as a board.” You may have also heard the variation, “Light as a feather, strong as an ox.” Together, repeat this over and over again.
Lift the person while continuing to chant.

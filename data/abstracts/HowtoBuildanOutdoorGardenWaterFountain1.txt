Consider the area where you are going to put your fountain.
Remember that fountains can be very heavy.
Figure out how you are going to power the fountain.
Place the fountain in full sun if you plan to have a solar powered fountain.
Consider purchasing a fountain that has an overflow mechanism if you live somewhere where it rains a lot.

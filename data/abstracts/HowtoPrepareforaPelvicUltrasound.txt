Check if you are having a transabdominal (full bladder) exam or an endovaginal/intravaginal (empty bladder) exam.Realize that everyone's kidneys produce urine at a different rate, so the instructions given to you by the clinic are aimed at the patient with the slowest bladder filling time.
Drink four (4) 8-ounce glasses of water one hour before the exam which is the usual requirement for the test.
Start earlier if you think you will be unable to drink the full amount.
Drink your water a bit closer to the exam time if you drink coffee or other caffeinated products, or take a diuretic (water pill).
Make sure to have breakfast on the day of the exam.
Hydrate yourself well by drinking water or other clear fluids the day before the exam.
Be aware that you may feel uncomfortable, but not painfully full when your bladder is the correct fullness.
Know that when the bladder is too full for the exam, it is actually in spasm so beginning to pee is difficult.

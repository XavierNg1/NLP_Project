Poke a small hole on either end of an egg.
Stick your toothpick or pin deep inside the egg through one of the holes to pierce the yolk.
Blow into one hole to gently force the liquid out of the egg.
Rinse out the now empty eggshell and let it sit to air dry.
Tape one end of the eggshell shut.
Roll a sheet of paper into a funnel and stick it into the eggshellâ€™s remaining hole.
Pour the filling into the egg with the funnel and tape the remaining hole shut.
Throw your egg bomb onto a hard surface!

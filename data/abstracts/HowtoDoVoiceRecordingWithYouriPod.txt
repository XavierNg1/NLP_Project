You will need to have a 3rd generation iPod for recording voice and other sounds.
To use of these devices you simply need to mount them on the top of your iPod.
As soon as you plug a recording device into your iPod, it will be recognized as “audio input” and will come up with the recording menu.
Once your iPod has catalogued the recording session, the session will be listed in the voice memos menu.
Transferring your recording sessions to your computer is just as easy as recording.
If your iTunes library settings are set to automatically update, you won’t have a choice about adding your recording session to your library.
When you choose the manual mode you will automatically be activating the enable disk use.
You might want to create a folder in your music directory that is called “iPod recordings”.
Choose the get info option from the open dropdown menu.
Once you have copied your audio files from your iPod to your computer you can delete them from your iPod to free up some space.

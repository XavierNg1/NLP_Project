Now we will make the gears "real", emulating a metallic surface, like gold (or call it bronze, the process is about the same).
Define the color.
Then take one wheel and apply the gradient to it.

,
For a 3D look, add a drop shadow (duplicate, make it black, move a few pixels down and right, move it under the wheel, add a bit of blur and maybe decrease the opacity).
Add some more gears (all your golden gears).

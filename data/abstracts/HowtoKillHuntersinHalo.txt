First of all, make sure you don't get backed up into a corner.
If you manage to do that, one pistol shot at the orange (uncovered) part of the Hunter will kill it (on any difficulty).
If that seems a bit hard, try either sticking them with a grenade and making sure they don't just block it, or throwing a grenade to the side and shooting them while they look at it.
If you think you're godly (which you might be), let them charge, then sidestep and melee them in the back, immediately get out of their way and sidestep again.
If you want to practice fighting in close quarters with them without relying on melee, try running up to them and immediately backing off.
Or, run at them, and at the last second jump up.
As hunters come in pairs, switch to a zoom weapon (Pistol/Sniper Rifle) And get rid of one like that.
Instead of that, you can also kill the first, then charge for the second one.
Alternate method of killing hunters: circle around them while meleeing them.
In order to sneak up to a Hunter, crouch and ever so gently push the joystick toward the hunter and do it in bursts, with this you can easily a attach a Plasma Grenade on their back.

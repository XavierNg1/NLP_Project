Get together two or three of your friends in a class that you all (including your crush) have together.
Begin to talk and trade emails.
If done correctly your crush will come to see what you're doing.
Explain to him/her that you are trading emails.
Have one of your friends invite him/her to swap his/hers email also.
He/she should now be giving everyone, including you, his/her email.
When you get home that day enter his/her email into your address book.

,
Send him/her and all of your friends who were "swapping" emails a "test email".
If he/she emails you back, great!,
If you don't get a reply, don't worry!

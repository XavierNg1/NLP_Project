Add the coconut oil and petroleum jelly into a microwave-safe bowl.
Add 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of beeswax if you want a firmer texture.
Put the bowl into the microwave and heat for 1 minute.
Take the bowl out, and stir ingredients with a spoon until everything is smooth.
Separate your melted mixture into smaller bowls if you want to have more than one color or flavor.
Stir in the powdered drink mix, and make sure that there are no lumps, clumps, or grains.
Transfer the mixture into a clean, empty lip balm container using a spoon or mini spatula.
Let the mixture cool a little, then put it into the fridge for 1 to 2 hours.
Finished.

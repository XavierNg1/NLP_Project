Ask what the charge is before you start.
Start with no more than three (3) minutes.
NEVER start your reading by being the one to spill out all your personal details before the seer has had a chance to tune into you.
Relax.
Don't feel you have to take the seer's advice!,
You get what you pay for.
If available, read the customer testimonials from the seer's previous clients.
Use a bit of caution about what can be predicted and what cannot: The visions are triggered based on emotions.
After hearing what seems to be an accurate set of predictions about the outcomes ahead, it's up to you to make the decisions you need to make.

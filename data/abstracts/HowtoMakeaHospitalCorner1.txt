Position a flat sheet over your mattress.
Tuck the bottom of the flat sheet in at the foot of the bed.
Choose a corner at the foot of the bed to start with.
Grab the bottom of the sheet 16 inches up from the foot of the bed and lift it up to form a tent shape.
Tuck the excess fabric underneath the mattress.
Let the sheet fall back down over the side of the mattress.
Tuck the hanging edge tightly under the mattress.
Repeat on the other corner (or corners, if you are using your flat sheet as your fitted sheet).
Smooth out any wrinkles on top of the sheet.

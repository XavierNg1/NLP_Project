Take a moment to breathe and reflect on your goal.
Give yourself space.
Look around you.Wherever you are, notice anything that stands out to you as interesting.
Don't take yourself too seriously.
Don't go desperately hunting for inspiration.
Draw on your own resources.
Enrich yourself.
Listen to inspirational music.
Try jotting down ideas that you have thought of previously.
Once you have an idea that you find interesting or emotional, close your eyes and picture exactly what it is that you are thinking about.
Once you feel that you have captured the essence of your idea, produce a rough outline on paper with more ideas relating to your main source.

Don't quit.
Organize and apply.
Exercise your creativity and embrace your source of inspiration.
Set yourself reachable goals.

Purchase two or three 2" square rubber stamps of flowers.
Squeeze out 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) of the primary and secondary colors using tube watercolors.
Use a 1" flat watercolor brush to paint a color over one of the rubber stamps and press it onto the border.
Create your fall subject.
Paint the subject with your watercolors.
Return to the outline of the border and make it double by drawing another line 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from the first one.
Wash in colors behind the stamped flowers on the border with watercolor.

Lie down on a flat surface.
Close your eyes and relax.
Keep relaxing until you feel or hear vibrations.
With your eyes closed, imagine your spiritual (astral) body lifting up from your physical, rested body.
Keep doing this until you feel like you're floating up.
If your astral projection was successful, you should see your physical body lying down below and could be walking around.

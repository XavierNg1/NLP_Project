Find some income.
Open up a savings account at your or your parents' bank.
Put as much money as you can in there, and make sure when it goes in, it doesn't come out.
Decide ahead of time which guitar you want.
Every weekend, call, go online to, or go to some local guitar stores.
Be patient.
When it comes time to buy the guitar, take a friend that plays guitar with you to get it.
Once you decide on buying it, make sure you haggle.
Now you have that guitar you've always dreamed of, and you don't have to go broke.

Shave your legs in the shower.
Now exfoliate everywhere you will be applying self tanner, but spend a little extra time on elbows, knees, hands, and feet, which are the roughest areas.
You can make your own body scrub by mixing granulated sugar with just enough olive oil, honey, lemon juice, and a dab of vanilla extract to make it stick together.
After you exfoliate apply body oil to your legs, feet, knees, and elbows while still in the shower.
Wash your body with a hydrating body wash to remove any shower oil, previous tan, and scrub left on your skin.

,
As soon as you get out of the shower and dry off, apply a thick body butter to your feet, knees, elbows, hands, and any other dry spots.
Now it's time to apply your self tanner.
To make your own self tanner, take a plain body lotion and a bit of sunscreen and squirt the amount wanted into a jar.
If you don't want to apply self tanner to your face, make your own oil-free version!,
Now you are all done and have a light-medium golden tan!

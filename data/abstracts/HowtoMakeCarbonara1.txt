Set a large, well-salted pot of water to boil on the stove.
Chop up the pancetta, guanciale, or bacon into quarter-inch squares.
Whip together the eggs, cheese, salt, and pepper in a small mixing bowl.
Boil the spaghetti (or other pasta of your choice) until almost cooked.
Fill a large mixing bowl with hot water and set aside.
Heat up 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat while the pasta cooks.
Add the chopped meat to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes.
Remove and drain the pasta, saving 1/2 cup of the hot, starchy water.
Toss the pasta in with the almost-finished meat and cook for an additional minute.
Empty the bowl full of hot water and toss in the pasta and meat mixture.
Slowly, stirring the whole time, pour the egg/cheese mixture into the pasta.
Serve with a light garnish immediately.

Be honest with yourself first.
Do not compare yourself with others.
Test yourself cautiously.
Listen to criticism, especially constructive criticism from people you trust.
Treat commitments seriously.
Take time to look at your failures, or incidences when you did not achieve your own personal goals.
Keep fantasies separate from realities.
Try new sports, activities, or pursuits with a goal, and work your way up to it.
Remember you are a unique person with your own talents, skills, and goals, and confidence or overconfidence can be a pitfall to be avoided if you mix modesty with your enthusiasm.

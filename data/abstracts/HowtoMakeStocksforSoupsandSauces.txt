For chicken stock, heat a little oil or butter over medium heat and add the carcass.
Add the vegetables and bouquet garni and add water to the pan until the ingredients are covered (approx 4 cups or 1 litre of water).
Strain the stock through a fine sieve or cheesecloth and it is ready for use.
For a rich brown beef stock, mix the bones and meat with a little melted butter in a roasting pan.
Tip the bones and meat trimmings into a stock pot and deglaze the roasting pan with a cup of water.
Add the vegetables and bouquet garni and simmer very gently for 30 minutes to 1 hour, then strain and use as required.
For light beef stock, follow the same procedure as for brown beef stock.
For vegetable stock, add a little oil into the stock pot and saut√© the vegetables gently for a light stock.
In a stock pan, add a little oil and add the fish scraps.

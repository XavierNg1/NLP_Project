To apply with a paint roller:,


Dump paint into the roller tray until it is almost full (less if you have a relatively small area to do).
To apply with a brush:


Dip the brush into the paint can, roller tray, or paper cup.
Clean baseboards and other surfaces immediately if paint splatters or runs onto them.
Before moving on to the next area, inspect for drips and wipe up with the brush or roller.
When finished with your painting session, do not leave your painting tools just lying around!

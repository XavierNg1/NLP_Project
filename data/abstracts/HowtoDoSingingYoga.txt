Create a yoga group.
Find the right place for yoga.
Make a CD or playlist of good yoga songs.
The first two sessions, don't worry about singing along.
On your third time, try to sing along with the songs.
Don't, don't DON'T even think about hitting the notes.
Close your eyes, and as you do the poses, let the words flow through your lips as though you couldn't stop them.

,
Pull your words from the very core of you.
Imagine that you are singing to the world, and every time a word leaves your mouth, the meaning of the song becomes true to someone, somewhere.

,
Think of the lyrics as a hug, wrapping around you and holding you securely.

,
Enjoy yoga.

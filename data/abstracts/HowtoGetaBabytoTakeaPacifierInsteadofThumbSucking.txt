Slowly introduce a pacifier to see how your baby reacts.
If baby responds positively to the pacifier, go ahead and skip to the next step, otherwise, if baby seems uninterested or dislikes the pacifier, try these suggestions:


First, if your baby starts to take the pacifier but then spits it out, try gently tugging on it when it is in your baby's mouth.
Now that baby is interested in the pacifier, keep a pacifier handy and offer it each and every time your baby starts to go for his/her thumb or hands.

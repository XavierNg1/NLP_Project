 

Form the shapes for your beads out of the Core Cork Clay.





Using the ART CLAY SILVER Paste, apply first coat to the cork form.

Keep layering on the paste and drying in between each layer until there is approximately 8-10 layers.
If making the heart bead that has a filigree corner, donâ€™t coat the entire bead.
When you have completed coating your bead and it is completely dry give it a light sand with a very fine sandpaper.
Decorate your bead.
Using the ART CLAY SILVER syringe continue to decorate your bead.
Once your bead is completely dry you are ready to fire it.
Rinse your bead under cold water and rinse all the cork ash from the middle.
Brush your bead with the stainless steel brush to remove clay residue.
Burnish your bead using the burnisher.

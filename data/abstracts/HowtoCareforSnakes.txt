Look for a reputable breeder or a very good pet store.
Ask to hold the snake of your choice.
Ask the pet store owner lots of questions.
Buy all equipment.
Set up all equipment properly and make sure everything is working and the lid or doors shut properly and lock securely.
Purchase your snake on a day that you just have to yourself.

Water must be changed regularly as the often defecate in it.

,
Change vivarium at least once a month and scrub it thoroughly in hot water.

Feed your snake separate from the tank, in a box.
To pick him up, reach in slowly without hesitation and grab the middle and slowly lift him up and out, supporting him fully with your arms and hands.

Don't pick your snake up if he is in his hiding spot, that means he needs time out and won't be too happy if you disturb him.

Have fun with your new pet!

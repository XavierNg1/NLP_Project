Determine the maximum power that will be drawn on the new circuit.
Select the proper gauge conductor for the maximum current of the circuit.
Purchase the correct circuit breaker.
Run the electrical cable for the new circuit.
Place a rubber mat or sheet of plywood (or other dry wood) in front of the service panel and stand on it while working in the panel.

,
Open the cover of the service panel and turn off the main breaker.

,
Note the location of unused circuit breaker spaces in the service panel cover.
Remove the service panel cover.

,
Measure the voltage to verify that the power is off in the service panel.
Choose the location in the service panel for the new circuit breaker.
Locate a circular knockout on the top, side or bottom of the service panel box that is convenient for entry of the new circuit cable and for routing conductors inside the box to the new circuit breaker location.
Install a cable clamp in the circular hole in the service panel box with the clamp on the outside of the box.
Route the cable to the new cable clamp.

,
Identify the location on the cable that will extend approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) inside the cable clamp.
Wrap electrical tape around the ends of the conductors to hold them together.
Determine whether your service panel has separate neutral and ground bus bars.
Route the ground conductor to the ground bus bar (or common neutral bus bar, as applicable).
Route the white wire to the neutral bus bar.
Determine how you will route the black wire to the location for the new circuit breaker.
Install the circuit breaker.
Test your installation by first turning on the main breaker in the service panel and then turning on the new circuit breaker.
Replace the breaker panel cover.

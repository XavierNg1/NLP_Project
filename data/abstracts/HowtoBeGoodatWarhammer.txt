Before making any major purchases, read the rules and develop a basic understanding of how the different armies work!,
You may want to own a giant Goblin horde because it would not only be an interesting force on the battlefield, but would also look great!,
Once you have about 500 points you should be ready for your first decent game (40k combat patrol requires 400 points, but it is still an excellent way to play a good game of Warhammer in a short space of time).
If you are mathematically minded, think about the probability of how many wounds you are likely to inflict with a certain weapon compared to another.
Don't expand your army too quickly.
Specializing your army isn't as simple as big and weak or small and strong-there are countless other things to consider, such as whether you want a shooty army-such as Tau-or a close combat army-such as Orks.
Eventually you may find that your army is big enough and that you want to go on to something else.
This will help you to think like your enemy next time you play someone with an army like the above.

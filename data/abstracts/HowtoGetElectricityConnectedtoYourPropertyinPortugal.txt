Make sure the property matches the correct criteria.
Consider the distance the nearest electrical post is from the property as this can be prove costly.
If the electric supply is current, visit the main office of EDP (Energias de Portugal) to sign up to a new contract.
Once you have signed the contract you can elect whether to have the electricity bills paid by direct debit with the bills being sent to your Portuguese address.

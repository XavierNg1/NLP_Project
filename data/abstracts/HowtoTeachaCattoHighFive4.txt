Prepare for the session.
Provide one treat off the saucer, then withdraw the plate to the table.
Stop the session when the treats are all gone or the cat loses interest.
Begin to reward only more significant paw movements.
Start to place your hand in the way of the cat’s paw as it comes back down.
Raise your hand a little with each attempt towards the point where your cat is reaching its paw.
Keep raising your hand higher and begin to rotate it to a horizontal position (palm facing to the side).
Rotate your hand into the traditional “high five” position, with your fingers up and palm facing the cat.
Continue the training.

Know thyself.
Know the other person.
Avoid pinning your worth on being part of a couple or even a family.
Remember that the best relationships are based on living, loving, and sharing:

Living means letting others live as they choose insofar as that doesn't infringe the dignity of others around them; don't try to change people or direct their life's choices - while there is room for guidance, don't force your preferences onto others.
Grasp the other person's perspective.
Be ready to face difficulties and problems within your relationships as they come up.
Be willing to take full responsibility for your own words and actions if you want your relationships to work.
Grow together.
Nurture your relationships.
Believe, trust, and assume good faith.

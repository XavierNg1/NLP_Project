Be persistent.
Keep asking questions of your motives, your story, and your characters.
Take breaks to get back some perspective.
Find opinions other than your own.
Ditch what doesn't work.
Remember that many authors fail at many drafts before they find an actual idea that's good enough to stick with.
Write what you know.
Keep at it.

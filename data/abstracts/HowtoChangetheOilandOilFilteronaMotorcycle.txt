Set up your spot.
Put your bike on the side stand, center-stand or rear-stand if you have one.
Allow the used/dirty oil to finish draining while you take off the filter.
Install a fresh drain plug crush washer.
Put the drain bolt back in.
Prep the filter by filling it about a quarter full of fresh oil.
Clear the filter area on the engine of grime and wipe a finger of fresh oil around the area just to get good clean contact.
If you haven't already, move the dirty oil away from the area so you don't spill it!,
Clean it up, double check you've returned all the caps and bolts, and you're good to go!,
Lastly, make double sure to check the level again as well as the filter, drain bolt, and fill cap tightness after your first ride!

Congratulations!

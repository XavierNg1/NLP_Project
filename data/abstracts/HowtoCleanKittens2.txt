Give your kitten a bath if she is very dirty.
Make sure to buy a shampoo that's designed specifically for cats.
Plan for after the bath.
Fill a shallow basin or sink with warm water.
Gently set your kitten into the washbasin.
Lather your kitten with cat shampoo.
Completely rinse your kitten.
Use as little water as possible.
Wrap the kitten in a dry, clean towel when you're done.

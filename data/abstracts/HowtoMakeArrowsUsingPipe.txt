Get out the things you'll need.Cut 3 centimeter (1.2 in) lengths from the pipe and make a mark 2/3 from one of the sides (1cm)

,Put the screw in from the side farthest from the mark to a little behind where the mark is, and hammer on it from both sides till you can't get it out by and (you have too unscrew it, but later)

,Hammer the sides diagonally and fold them to make a point form (it doesn't matter if it's perfect, you'll get it into better shape later)

,
Cut the sides on the bottom of the point and fold them over the sides.
Assemble the arrow.
Glue on your arrowheads and paint the shafts if you're going to.
Cut the feathers/bike tire in more or less this shape (10-12cm across and 2 cm in the highest point), and make a mark along the arrows circumference 4 centimeter (1.6 in) from the back of the arrow.
With your pencil sharpener, sharpen the end of the arrow (the will-be nock) until it is about half the diameter as the rest of the shaft.

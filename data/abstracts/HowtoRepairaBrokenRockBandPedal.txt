Cut one of the mending plates in half.
Drill a pair of 1/4" holes through the pedal with the drill press or electric hand drill, after measuring with the mending plate that is still intact.
Put the plates on both sides of the bottom hole.Secure the top of the mending plate with the other nut and bolt, which will hold the top of the plate in place.
You're ready to rock again.

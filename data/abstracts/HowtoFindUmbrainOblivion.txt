Start at the Imperial City Waterfront and position yourself so that you are facing a crossroads that is (or should be) southwest of the waterfront.
Swim all the way there (this is really good for the athletics skill) until you get the shore nearest the crossroads.
As you get closer, they will come up as Vindasel.
Watch for the many traps that these ruins have.
Eventually, you will get to the one final chamber.

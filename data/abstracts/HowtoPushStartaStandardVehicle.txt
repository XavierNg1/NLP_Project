Ensure that the standard vehicle cannot be started regularly through the use of it's key.
Place the key in its keyhole and turn it all the way into the "on" position.
Immediately before the car is pushed, ensure that the key is in on position.
Once the car is pushed to a significant speed of approximately 10–25 km/h (6.2–15.5 mph) in 2nd gear (or reverse) or 25–40 km/h (16–25 mph) in 3rd gear, the driver will need to engage the clutch for a split second (this is known as popping the clutch).
Be conscious that during the split second that the clutch pedal was released the car will have effectively started the engine.
Leave the car on for approximately 15 minutes to allow the alternator enough time to recharge the battery.
Get it checked.

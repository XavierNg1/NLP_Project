Plan ahead.
Meet somewhere convenient for both of you.
Don’t be self-conscious about asking people to hang out.It’s not always easy to reach out, especially when you haven’t seen this person in a while or your last attempt to make plans was unsuccessful.
Create big groups to get more people involved.When everyone is busy, it’s often tough to find one-on-one time for everyone.
Make sure your friend time isn’t distracting from alone time.

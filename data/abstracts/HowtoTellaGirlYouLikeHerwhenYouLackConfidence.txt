Make sure you like her.
Is she someone you can see spending the rest of your life with?,
Study her.
Buck up.
Becoming a friend is a important step.
Do not ask her out on a social network.
Do it in person.
Try to be yourself and go for girls in your league.
If you're really shy don't go straight at her with the fast,"I love you, go out with me?!"

Find a finished cardboard roll.
Squash the cardboard tube so that the tube is flattened down one side.
Place bait into one end of the tube.
Place the tube over the edge of a countertop or table so that it balances precariously.
Place a tall trash can under the lip of the countertop or table over which you've balanced the tube.
Wait.
If you have no suitable surface for a mouse to fall into the trash can from, you can create a ramp from a simple cardboard box and "reset" your trap that way.

,
Clean the trash can thoroughly with hot soapy water and dispose of any mouse poop using rubber gloves.

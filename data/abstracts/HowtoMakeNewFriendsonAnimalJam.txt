Go to Jamaa Township and try to find parties to go to.
Once you find a party, say random things like, "I like bananas" or "Everything is awesome!",
Once someone starts talking to you, engage in a conversation.
Play games and adventures with other Jammers.

,
After a while of talking, they might ask to be your buddy and take you to their den.
Trade!,
You now have gained a friend!

Put all your items in the bank.
Go to the least populated world possible and travel northwest, beyond Varrock and the Lumberyard, and enter the wilderness from there.

,
Once you are in the wilderness, head due east until you hit the end; an ocean.
Head more north, you will eventually reach the gates of a member's-only area.
Know that after a couple of yards, you will encounter some Giant Spiders that can be as weak as level two or as strong as level 40.
Now you may be entering the land of the ice beasts!,
If you have the will to live, try to bypass this area by heading southwest until you can't go any further, blocked by mountains.
Enter level 20 or so, you will come across the remnants of a ruined village.
Keep heading south and you will pass a Chaos Altar which you may stop by if you were using any prayers.
Reach the wilderness ditch!

Before your first class, bend your pointe shoe a bit at the arch.
Break in the box (front part) of the shoes by gently pressing the top until it gives a little.
For your first class, try to keep this kind of breaking-in minimal, just enough so that the shoes are wearable.
All your sewing should be done with either pointe shoe thread, or dental floss.

Add a new link as soon as possible to return your chain to its normal length.
Face the master link the right direction.
Pinch the links together to unhook the two halves of the master link.
Take each half and push it through the whole on opposite ends of the chain.
Bring the chain together and link the exposed pins through the figure-eight holes on the opposing links.
Use a pair of pliers to push the master link together, clicking the pins into place.
Know that, in the end, a broken chain usually means you need a brand new one.

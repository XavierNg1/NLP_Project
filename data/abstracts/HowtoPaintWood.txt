Take your time to prepare the wood for painting.
Remove any old paint from the wood as necessary.
Fill all dings and deep gouges with quality wood putty, if possible.
Sand the surface of the wood with coarse sandpaper and finish off with fine sandpaper.
Clean off any dust or wood residue with a clean towel.
Tape off any parts of the wood that you don't wish to paint.
Prime the wood.
Choose your type of paint.
Choose a kind of sheen for your paint.
Whatever kind of paint you choose, use high quality paint and brushes.
Load your paintbrush with paint.
With a loaded brush, start from the top of the wood and move down.
Use an unloaded brush to pull the tips across the paint.
Wait for the paint to dry fully before repeating the process one to two more times.
Determine if you need a sealer or clear topcoat to preserve the paint on top of the wood.
Prep the surface of the painted wood by lightly sanding and vacuuming off any paint residue.
Apply up to three coats of sealer or topcoat of polyurethane, depending on your preference and topcoat directions.

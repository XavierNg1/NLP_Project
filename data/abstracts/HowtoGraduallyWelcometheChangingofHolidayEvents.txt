Put out a few ornamental pumpkins and a few scarecrows for Halloween.
Decorate the exterior of your house.
Leave the ornamental pumpkins and scarecrows out for Thanksgiving.
Put away the scarecrows and pumpkins and bring on the Holiday stuff...during Thanksgiving weekend, or shortly after, is a perfect time to start decorating for the Holidays...just ease in to it.

Once the decorations for Fall are taken down and you are getting ready for Winter, don't forget to hang a festive Holiday wreath on your front door, or a large red velvet bow that looks nice.
Don't forget to change your towels- fall is gone, and winter is here.
You can go to a nearby park that has pine trees and pick you up a bag or two of pine cones of all shapes and sizes.
Find some of the popcorn ball type pine cones, you can add a few of them in to your decorative bowls or baskets.
Fill some wicker baskets with pine cones and set them in your kitchen or bathroom; you can add a small amount of potpourri under the pine cones such as Cinnamon, or any holiday scent...small holiday bowls from the store are great for this.

Buy different flavors of candy canes.
Add some artificial Holly or Poinsettias to existing plants...cut the stem off a few of them and add them to your shelves, even place them in the bathroom, on the towel shelf.

Give yourself enough time to get ready if you want to learn to be on time.
Don't give yourself permission to be late by making excuses for it.
Allow ample time for your journey.
Avoid overextending yourself by scheduling too many appointments around the same time.
Refrain from accepting invitations that you cannot realistically fit into your schedule.
Always give yourself more time than you need to get there.

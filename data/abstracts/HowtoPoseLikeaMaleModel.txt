Keep your shoulders squared to the camera.
Tighten your core.
Work on the strolling pose.
Lean against a wall.
Put your hands in your pockets.
Touch your face.
Use one hand to adjust your tie.
Cross your arms.
Narrow your eyes with a bit of a squint.
Extend your chin forward and down.
Show some teeth with you smile.
Look past the camera.

Understand the difference between honing and sharpening your knives.
Hold the honing rod down, perpendicular to the counter.
Hold the blade against the rod at a 45-degree angle to the honing rod.
Rotate the blade halfway towards the rod to create a roughly 20-23-degree angle.
Pull the knife quickly towards you to hone it.
Switch to the other side of the blade and repeat.
Replace your honing rod when it becomes visibly dull.

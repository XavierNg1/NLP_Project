Make sure your lips aren't dry - moistening them (but not too much) makes it easier for your lips to slide over your partner's.
Let your partner take the lead sometimes and get used to his or her style.
Close your eyes just before your lips touch.
Use your hands!,
Let them know what they are doing is good.
If you're smaller than the partner you're going to kiss, then hold your head a little back and stand on your tiptoes if comfortable.
If you're taller than the partner you're going to kiss, bend your head a little down and keep your legs a little wide apart for the other person to stand.

French Kiss.
Relax!

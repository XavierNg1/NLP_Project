If you pare it down to the absolute basics, all you need is a saw and a drill, but to do the job right you really need:

Hand saw with a fairly fine cross-cut blade.
Materials: Wood and something for the thongs.
Soles and ha: The soles for the typical adult geta are about 4 or 5 inches (10.2 or 12.7 cm) wide, 9 to 11 inches (22.9 to 27.9 cm) long, and 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 inch (1.3 to 1.9 cm) thick.
Most lumber yards (and Lowes) only sell "full" boards, usually 8 feet (2.4 m) long.
Thongs: I tried using nylon rope from the hardware store for the thongs, but it's not very comfortable.
The next layer which brings the total diameter to nearly 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) is some sort of fuzzy stuff that's like the gray padding you see in some shipping envelopes -- it looks like lint.Get about 1 1⁄2 yards (1.4 m) for each pair.
Miscellaneous: 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) nylon cord or rope for the small loop that holds the main thong between the toes.
Carpenter's glue.
Start thinking about ways to clamp the pieces in position while the glue dries.
Another way is to put a couple large rubber bands around the pieces, tightly wrap masking tape around it, or to pile books or bricks on the joint.
For the single piece Geta, it's going to take considerably more effort, but the result is a more authentic (and more durable) alternative to the fake geta.
Finishing- To protect your wood from water/sweat damage, I suggest using polyurethane or another kind of wood finish to protect the wood.

Look for four trees positioned so that they make a rectangle, with no trees in the middle.
Secure two similar length sticks to the longest sides of the rectangle.
Create a frame for sitting and lying on.
Put a cloth, such as a coat or sleeping bag, over the sticks.
Spend the night on the swamp bed.
Finished.

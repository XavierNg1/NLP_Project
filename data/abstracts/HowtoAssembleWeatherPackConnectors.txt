Strip the wire about 3/16".
Select the correctly sized seal and slip this over the wire's insulation.
A high quality Weather Pack Crimping tool is very important for a good crimp.
Notice this terminal positioning block on the back side of this crimper, that will be key to a perfect crimp.
Slip the already stripped wire and seal assembly into the terminal.
Squeeze the Weather Pack Connector tool's grip to crimp the terminal.

After the terminal has been crimped, the ratcheting mechanism of the crimping tool will release and allow the tool to open, releasing the crimped terminal/wire.
Now you can poke the crimped terminal/wire/seal assembly into the back side of the WeatherPack housing.

Once you've inserted the terminal properly, you will feel it 'click' into place, and it will not pull back out easily due to the retainer tangs.

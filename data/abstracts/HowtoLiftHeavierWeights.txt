It all starts with what you already have: If you are already somewhat muscular, are in decent shape and have all the equipment you need, very good.
Make sure you haven't eaten 30 minutes before you start exercising, or you might end up with cramps.
Do a warming up before you start exercising.
After you are done with your warming up and stretches, it is time to grab your weights.
Try to work out for at least 30 minutes.
After you are completely done, take a hot shower and/or bath.
Try to make a routine that you follow.
After about a week, you will notice that it has become easier to do the same exercises with the same weights.

Keep your word.
Be on time.When you are late, whether that is to an appointment, a meeting, a deadline or responding to an email, you lose the respect of others because they feel that you donâ€™t value their time.
Avoid gossiping.Frequently engaging in gossip, especially negative gossip that puts other people down, will do nothing good for you.
Stand up for someone else.

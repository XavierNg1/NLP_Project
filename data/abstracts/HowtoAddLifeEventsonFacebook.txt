Go to your profile.
In the box where you basically post your statuses or photos or videos, you’ll see a link that says ‘Life Events’.
You’ll get various options to choose from on the different events you’d like to add on Facebook.
After selecting your option, you’ll again see more options that you can choose from.
A box should pop up after selecting an option.
You can even add photos to your events if you feel like it.
There’s an option you’ll find at the bottom (of the box) that says ‘Public’.
Now, click ‘Save’.

After each metal detecting session, clean your coins with detergent and water.
Tip the coins onto a tray and inspect them with a magnifying glass or jewelers loupe.
Dry and accumulate the coins to rock tumble in a container with a lid.
Use vinegar and salt for a quick and effective cleaning of your coins in the rock tumbler.
Constantly monitor the condition of the rock tumbler drum because cleaning with vinegar creates a gas that could burst the rubber drum.
Do your cleaning in three parts instead of one long session.
Rock tumble the coins that require further cleaning.
Redeem your severely corroded or damaged coins with the US mint (or other relevant national mint) when you have a large quantity of them.

Make sure the lizard you are about to catch is not dangerous.
Catch lizards in your house as soon as possible.
Use gloves when handling the lizard.
Check your local laws before releasing lizards.Depending on the type of lizard youâ€™ve caught, you may or may not be able to release it back into the wild.
Approach lizards from the side.The lizard is more likely to panic and scramble out of your grasp if you try to grab it by its tail -- which might actually come off in your hand depending on the species -- or try to grab it from above.
Support small lizards with one hand and larger lizards with two hands.

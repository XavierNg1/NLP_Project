Get the tools and supplies (see below).
Clear the room of all movable items, and cover things you can't or don't move.
Take the opportunity to make your walls flat.
Remove hardware (doorknobs, handles, hinges, electrical outlets, electrical switch covers, smoke detectors, doorbells, etc.),
Make the room dust-free.
Carefully consider what you will be painting.
If you have mold or mildew, remove it with a mix of bleach and water (50% of each), then wash again with plain water.
Prepare the surfaces to be painted.
Remove any grease on the walls.
Read the can before starting, so you know how long it will take to dry.
Apply your masking tape to the edges of areas that will not be painted (cabinets, windows, woodwork, floor, ceiling, etc.),
Deploy your drop cloth, making sure all areas in the danger zone are completely covered.
Prevent tracking of paint into other rooms.
Prime!,
Update your masking if necessary.

,
Paint!,
Remove masking when finished.
If you had paint bleed under your masking tape, you can take a very small paintbrush (typically sold at art stores) and very carefully touch up the lines.
If you accidentally splattered the wrong color in certain areas despite your careful masking and covering, touch them up with a brush and some extra paint of the right color, being careful not to splatter yet again.

,
Wait until paint drips are dry before removing your drop cloths.

,
After the last coat is completely dry, replace any hardware you removed.
Enjoy your new room!

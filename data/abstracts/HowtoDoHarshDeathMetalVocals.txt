Learn how to sing properly.
Take a slow approach when beginning your practices.
Drink lukewarm water or tea an hour before performing, as well as in between songs.
Warm up your voice before recording or performing death metal.
Fill up your lungs with air, then push out some of the air, tightening your throat and moving your tonsils as you do this.
Visualize a column of air rising from your diaphragm, through your chest, and up through your facial mask (the space behind the nose, under the eyes, above the upper teeth).
Push through your abdomen.
Create the "angry sigh" sound.
Practice growling like a dog.
Pick a lyric you want to perform.
Drink a healthy beverage, such as water, after you're done performing death metal vocals.

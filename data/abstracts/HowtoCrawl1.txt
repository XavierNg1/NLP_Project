Know that all baby's learn to crawl differently.
Give them a good surface to learn to crawl on.
Schedule "tummy time" when they are around three months old.
Keep their hands, feet, elbows, and knees uncovered.
Put toys just out of their reach.
Consider purchasing an infant crawling track.
Be careful of your baby's new-found mobility.

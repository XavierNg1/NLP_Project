Get up early - for many people, the first 20 minutes of their day is the most stressful, reducing their energy for the rest of the day.
Don't skip breakfast.
Start your day well dressed, well groomed & most of all, with a big smile.
Arrive for work half an hour early.
Use that half hour.
When someone asks you to do something, take a moment and listen.
Don't get angry or stressed, even over small things, it only makes your day unpleasant.
Be assertive, but avoid conflict.
Plan on going home on time.

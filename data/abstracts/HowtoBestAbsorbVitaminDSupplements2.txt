Choose the correct vitamin D supplement.
Take your vitamin D supplement with the largest meal of the day.
Examine your medications before taking vitamin D supplements.
Consider increasing your intake of other nutrients that are cofactors of vitamin D. Cofactors are nutrients that work together to help the body absorb as much of the nutrients as possible.
Lose some weight.
Work with your doctor to try to treat underlying medical conditions that could be affecting your body’s ability to absorb vitamin D. As mentioned in the previous section, there are some medical conditions that can affect how your body activates vitamin D. In particular, weak kidneys can limit your body’s ability to activate the vitamin D that you consume (either through sun, food, or supplement).

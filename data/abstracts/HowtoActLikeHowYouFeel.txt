Write down everything you think and want to do freely.
Take a look at your aims.
Continue writing until you feel that you've adequately addressed the feelings that truly represent you.
Begin to put your list of feelings as actions into action.
Express yourself through talking, shouting, explaining yourself.
Wear the clothes that you like and care about.
Devote as much or as little time to your appearance as you see fit.
Let your emotions, feelings and opinions have self-determined outlets.
Come up with more of your own actions.

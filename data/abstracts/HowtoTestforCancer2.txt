Ask about genetic testing if you have a family history of cancer.Some forms of cancer, such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and certain hereditary forms of colon cancer, are known to run in families and to be directly related to genes.
Prevent a recurrence of cancer by monitoring tumor markers.If you have had cancer in the past that was cured (or is in remission), you can ask your doctor about tumor marker testing which tests for the presence of any recurrence of your previous cancer.
Understand that it is the progression of tumor markers over time that matters.Many people worry about the exact numerical measurements of their tumor markers.

If you feel the urge to laugh or say something completely irrelevant, excuse yourself immediately, if possible.
Think before you laugh.
Think of something sad and depressing.
Try pinching yourself or causing some other strong physical sensation, such as biting your inner cheek or your tongue (don't bite too hard!).
Use your breathing to control the laughter.
Focus on your mouth to ease the laughter.
Bite yourself.
Distract yourself.

Be vigilant about what you are surfing on, and what's coming up in front of you.
Look straight in front of you while surfing, and not up, and especially not down (unless the ramp is going down), otherwise you will just fall off and die, or go to the jail.
Make sure that you are pressing the right buttons, and not back, or forwards, for these keys do not help you.

If you have enough speed, and there is a turning ramp coming up, completely avoid it, but ONLY if you have enough speed.
If a Scout is given, do NOT switch to knife before doing any acrobatics.

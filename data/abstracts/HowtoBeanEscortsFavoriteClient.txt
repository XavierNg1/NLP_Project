Wherever you find your escort, research her.
Be on time, or call if you will be more than 10 minutes late.
Know what's on menu in advance and do not deviate from it.
Never ever discuss sexual acts or money in person.
Money first always!,
Be nice, treat her like a lady, and be respectful.
Don't feel like you need to blow her mind sexually.
Try to read her cues.
She will not be offended if you need to leave right after.
Tip!,
Ask her if she would like to be reviewed.
Always be clean!!!,
That's it!,
Bring wine or a gift.

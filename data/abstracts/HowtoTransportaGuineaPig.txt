Get a small-ish guinea pig cage that will fit in the backseat of your car.
Fill it with a thick layer of newspaper or a waterproof sheet and cover with a soft fleece or towel bedding.

,
Place an attachable ceramic bowl in the cage and fill it with your guinea pig's favorite food before hooking it to the cage.
Hook up a water bottle and fill it up to the brim.
Put a few handfuls of hay into the cage.

,
Give your guinea pig a toy or two as long as they are light and small - you don't want them to slide and hit your guinea pigs.

,
Put some veggies your guinea pigs like into the cage.

,
Put your guinea pigs in to the cage and put the cage in the car on a seat with the seat belt done up.
Talk to your guinea pigs whenever you get the chance.
Try to pull pull over at a rest stop every hour.
When you have reached your destination, move your guinea pig into a proper hutch or cage, away from direct sunlight.

Isolate the problem.
If you and your friend actually had a confrontation, think about how the situation progressed from your side.
If no actual confrontation occurred and you feel that your friend is ignoring you because you have done something to hurt him or her, think about how your last interaction occurred.
Take a break if you're the one who's upset.
Once you know the problem, think about how it can be solved.
Set up a conversation with your friend.
Think honestly and hard about what you did wrong in this situation and prepare yourself to apologize.
Allow your friend to vent a little.
Make a peace offering.
Get back to normal as soon as possible.
Know when to move on.

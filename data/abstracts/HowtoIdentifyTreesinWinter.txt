Get field guides to your local trees.
Avoid ornamentals, if you're a novice.
Go for a walk, and take some guides with you.
Focus on trees that stand out, rather than going methodically from tree to tree.
Look for leftover growth up in the branches.
Look for short spiny spur branches, the sure mark of a plum, pear or apple - a fruiting tree in the rose family:

,
Learn your families, rather than isolating trees by species.
Look for very peculiar bark, such as the warty trunk of this hackberry, common along river bottoms (though different varieties can also be found on mountaintops).
Look for anything flowering, even in the dead of winter (especially in the American South), such as this silverberry, with its silver-speckled foliage, flowers, and immature fruit:


Red maple (acer rubrum) is usually the first tree to flower in the spring - in the American South that's in February.

Look for trees still holding on to their dead leaves throughout the winter, a common habit of beech:

,
Don't forget the conifers, almost always evergreen, with easily identifiable needles .
Use the internet, where possible, to finish the identification process.
Take photos, and save them in a file with both the label of the tree and time of year the picture was taken.
Collect samples, and put them in a scrapbook.

Start off by washing your hair.
Get out your basic hair dye tools.
Before you start using chemicals (such as bleach), always make sure you're wearing clothing that you don't mind getting stained.
Separate your hair into sections starting from bottom to top; almost like you're flat ironing your hair, but split into two.
Tone your hair to get rid of brassiness.You can purchase toners at Sally's Beauty Supply.
Now it's time to dye your hair purple.
Pour out your dye into a plastic bowl and place a tinting brush in it.
Cover your hair with a shower cap.
Finally, wash it out with clear water and vinegar (this helps set the color) until it runs clear.

Your hair is now bright purple!

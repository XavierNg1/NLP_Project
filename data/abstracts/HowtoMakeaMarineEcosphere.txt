Get a jar of your choice, like a mason or pickle jar (depending on how big you want your ecosphere).
Wash your jar for 60 seconds with only warm water as soap will kill the organisms.
Collect sand from either the playground, or a very clean beach.
Add ocean water.
After you put sand in(about 1" deep), fill you jar with seawater,leaving about 2" of airspace on the top.
Always include small sea shells.
Now add animals.
After you add the animals into your jar, seal it up and never open it again.

Decide how much you want to spend and what type of green screen you want; either hard or soft.
To create a hard green screen, simply paint a solid material (balsa wood or cardboard) green and still get the same outcome.
To create a soft screen, buy light, bright green material from a sewing or crafts shop.
When you hang the screen (if you choose the soft option), there are several ways that you can do this.
If you want your screen to be mobile, you will need two frames such as hat stands.
When traveling with your screen, ensure that you roll it up rather than folding it, otherwise you'll get creases which will upset the consistency of the colour.
Provide lighting.

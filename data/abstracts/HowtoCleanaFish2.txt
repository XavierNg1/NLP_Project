Lay the fish on one side and cut just behind the top of the head until you hit the backbone.
Continue this cut in an arc around the fish's head.
Turn the knife and cut horizontally towards the tail, through the center of the fish.
Flip the fish and repeat on the opposite side.
Using a smaller knife, lift and remove the ribcage from the inside of the fillet.
Scale the fish or remove the skin entirely.
Alternatively, use a sharp knife to cut directly through the fish, perpendicularly, to form steaks.

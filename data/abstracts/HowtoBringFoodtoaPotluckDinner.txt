Know that if the potluck supper is small (only a few individuals or families), ask "What can I bring?",
Find out if the event is a community-wide feast, "bring a dish to share" means enough for twelve servings.
Bring an appropriate serving utensil: It is unpleasant to watch the town ladle travel from chili to the fruit salad.
Bring whatever hot pads and trivets may be necessary.
Put the food in a real serving dish; that is to say: pottery.
Remember that presentation is important.
Establish a trademark dish that you can make easily, quickly, and well, with preparation time and ingredients that fit your schedule and your budget.
Bring something recognizable.
Know that unless they are offered, don't leave with anyone else's leftovers.

Lead your horse somewhere quiet so he can focus on you.
Run forward with your horse, but with your back away from the horse.
Stop your horse.
Make an upward motion with your arms toward your horse.
Stand somewhere high to direct your horse.
Raise an arm with a treat and command your horse “up” or “rear.” Take your treat in one hand and move it up, sternly saying “up.” He will stretch his neck to try to eat the treat.
Repeat this process as long as needed.
Continue this routine until your horse fully rears.
Ride your horse and rear.
Use the same "up" cue when riding.
Release pressure when your horse raises slightly.
Continue this process until he gets confident, and rears on cue.

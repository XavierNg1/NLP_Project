Determine your budget.
Determine the average age of your guests.
Determine the size.
See if there are any local bands that fit your criteria.
Think about how long do you want the band to perform.
Decide if you would like a live first dance.
Determine if your venue accept the band.
Using your answers, shortlist 3 or so bands based on the criteria and most importantly, the demos and videos.
Once you have confidence in a band, contact them stating your requirements as mentioned in our checklist above.
As the prices come back, compare them with your set budget (if you have one) and if they are close but over, ask the band if they can better their offer.
Once you have found your perfect band, book them as quickly as possible.
Always work to a contract, and if you donâ€™t receive one, request one.

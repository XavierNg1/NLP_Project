Find a small stuffed animal.
Cut a small hole in the bottom of the stuffed animal.
If stuffing is leaking out, remove enough of it so that your cat will not try to pull out or eat the stuffing.
Squirt a small dab of glue onto one end of the straw.
Hold the end of the straw and wave it around in front of your cat.

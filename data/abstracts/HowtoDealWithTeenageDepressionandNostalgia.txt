Think about why you are miserable now that you are in your teens and what's making you long to be back in the past.
Fill a diary with your current thoughts and feelings every week or so if you really don't know why you are depressed.
Accept your present situation.
Look through the list you created.
Ditch all those impossible whims from the list, it's a total waste of time mourning over it.
Get moving!,
If you are sad because you are away from home(for teens studying or working abroad), it can be really difficult.
Find out if there is anything you can do.
Stick with people who are friendly and can help you.
Give your nostalgia a chance.

Open an Adobe Illustrator document.
Select the layer that you want to change in your Layers Window, or create a new layer on top of the object to place your brushes on.
Find the paintbrush tool in your Tools Palette.
Go to the Windows Menu and choose the "Brushes" option, in order to bring up the brush window.
Go to the bottom of your Tools Palette.
Return to your object.
Return to your Brushes Window and find the small box in the lower left hand corner.
Change your brush stroke by selecting the stroke you have just made with your direct selection tool (black arrow) at the top of your tool bar.
Create a new layer with each new brush stroke style you decide to use, so that you can change your strokes independently.

Measure your windows to decide how large your want each curtain panel to be.
Choose your fabric, then wash, dry, and iron it, if necessary, to get rid of any shrinking and wrinkles.
Cut each panel 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) longer and 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) wider than you want them to be.
Fold the bottom hem up by ½ inch (1.27) centimeters, and press it flat with an iron.
Fold the bottom hem up again, this time by 5 inches (12.7 centimeters).
Fold each side hem over twice by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), and press flat with an iron.
Fold the top hem down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), and press flat with an iron.
Fold the top hem down again, but this time by 6 inches (15.24 centimeters), and press flat with an iron.
Flip the curtain so that the right side is facing you, and press the hems flat for 3 to 5 seconds.
Leave the top hem alone if you want to slide it onto the curtain rod, or use clip-on curtain rings.
Consider attaching some tabs to make a self-pleating curtain.
Hang your curtains.

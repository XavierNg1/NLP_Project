Get the right fish.
Use corals (generally soft corals, which are like masses of little anemones without much of a sting) and macroalgae that do not require a lot of light.
Make the aquarium colorful with a lot of macroalgae and soft corals and relatively few animals that move such as fish and shrimp.
Circulate the water vigorously everywhere in the aquarium to let the live rock and sand filter it biologically, to keep material from building up and rotting anywhere, and to keep food suspended so the fish will have a long time to see and eat it with little waste.
If the corals are open and growing well, the water quality is probably fine.
Make sure the aquarium has a protein skimmer.
Don't make your filter-feeders fight the machine - put it on a timer!,
Clean the glass with a magnetic cleaner from the outside.
An entirely plastic-bodied heater greatly reduces the risk of heater breakage.

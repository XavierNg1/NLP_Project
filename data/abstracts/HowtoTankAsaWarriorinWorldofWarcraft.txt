Use Defensive Stance - Although all skilled tanks should spec into Tactical Mastery and switch stances when necessary, (like using Mocking Blow or Intercept) it is important that your main and most common stance when tanking is the Defensive Stance.
Use a shield - Make sure you have a shield and a one-hander.

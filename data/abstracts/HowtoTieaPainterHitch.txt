Fold the rope over on itself to create a "bight," or a U-shape in the rope.
Lay the bight over the rod you want to create the knot on.
Tuck the bight back under the rod, back towards your body.
Take the left-most strand of rope and tuck it through your bight, creating another bight.
Take the right strand of rope and create another bight.
Pass the third bight back through the second one.
Still pinching the last bight your made, grab the rope leading back to your body and pull to tighten.
Pull the "tail," or the shorter right end of the rope, to quickly undo the knot.

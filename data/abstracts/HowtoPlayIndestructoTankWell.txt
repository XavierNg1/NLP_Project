Survive the first level.
When you win levels, you will see a small grey screen with a continue button.
As you progress through the game, you will see that the more combos you receive, the higher your score.
Finally, when you reach level 100, there will be no Fuel for you to worry about, and all of your frequencies will be maxed out, enabling you to do as freely as possible.

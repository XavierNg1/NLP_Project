Make sure your USB key is ok before you begin.
Go to Boot Camp.
Wait until it runs the "network error" and do not touch anything.
Go in the Finder and find your key, which should be on the left.
Download manually the drivers that Boot Camp couldn't get access to.
Add the drivers to the key and partition.
Manually partition your hard drive, since Boot Camp didn't do it.
Reboot on Windows.
Add drivers.

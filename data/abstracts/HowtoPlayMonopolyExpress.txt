Choose how many players there will be.
Determine a target goal.
On your turn...
Roll the house die.
End your turn whenever you like, just don't go too far or you could roll all 3 policemen, resulting in you losing everything you've earned in that turn!

Another way is to get a random marker (anything that is small) and put on the go space.

,
When someone rolls a one it goes forward one space if someone rolls a snake eyes (two ones) it goes forward two spaces.

,
When it goes all the way around the board once the game is over and the person with the most amount of money wins.

,
If you want to play a tad longer, if someone rolls a six, it goes back one space, if someone rolls a jackpot (two sixes) he goes backward two spaces.

Keep the girl on her toes after you meet.
Play it cool when it comes to calling or texting her.
Once you exchange phone numbers with her, let her call you first.
Don't open up about your feelings too fast.
Don't look available all of the time.
Don't break the touch barrier too soon.
Don't linger too long at first.
Open up to her little by little.
Don't be mean or rude when playing hard to get.
Don't be completely open about your plans.
Reveal your true feelings little by little.
Make sure you don't take it too far.
Know that the chase is never over.

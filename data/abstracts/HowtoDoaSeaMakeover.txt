Start by curling your hair.
Put on foundation, if you think it's necessary.
Next, you should do your eye makeup.
With an eyeshadow brush, apply a light blue eye shadow all over the lid and spread lime green eye shadow on the inner half of the crease.
For a more beachy, awake effect, apply a skin tone eye shadow all over the brow bone and then apply a dot of white eye shadow on the tear duct.
Apply a dark blue liner on upper and lower lash line.
Curl your lashes and apply your favorite mascara.
Apply a coral pink blush on cheekbones lightly.
Apply a coral pink lipstick or lip gloss for the finishing touch.

If you want to wear a sea-inspired outfit, try shorts with a plain white t-shirt and flip flops, or a bikini under a summer dress with a floral pattern.
For accessories, think beachy.
You're done!

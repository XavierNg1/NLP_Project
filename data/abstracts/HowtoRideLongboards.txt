Find yourself a surfboard 8 foot (2.4 m) or taller.
Make sure that the board has a non slippery surface before heading out.
Find out the local surf report for 1–2 foot (0.3–0.6 m) waves for beginners, Surfline.com is usually reliable.
Get in the water and paddle.
Find the sweet spot.
Paddle with good posture.
Get past the break and watch the sets, find the best area where the waves are breaking and reposition yourself just outside it to wait for the right wave.
Turn and paddle hard to gain momentum once you spot your wave.
Stand up!,
Lean one way or another and slowly turn, once you've caught the wave.
After the initial dropping into a wave and making the bottom turn, the critical part of your ride is over.
Don't get discouraged.

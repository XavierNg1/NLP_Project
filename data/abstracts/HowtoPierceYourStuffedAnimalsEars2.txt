Take two barrettes and clip them onto the spot where you want to pierce your animal's ears as a guide to wear to pierce.
Take two safety pins and push them into the barrette holes.
Remove the pins and put in a pair of earrings that you think would match your stuffed animal's fur or eye color.
You're all done!

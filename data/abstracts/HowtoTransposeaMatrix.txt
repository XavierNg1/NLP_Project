Start with any matrix.
Turn the first row of the matrix into the first column of its transpose.
Repeat for the remaining rows.
Practice on a non-square matrix.
Express the transposition mathematically.
(MT)T = M. The transpose of a transpose is the original matrix.This is pretty intuitive, since all you're doing is switching the rows and columns.
Flip square matrices over the main diagonal.
Transpose a symmetric matrix.
Start with a complex matrix.
Take the complex conjugate.
Transpose the results.

Put aside your feelings about your weight.
Spend time talking together.
Be well groomed.
Pluck up the courage to ask.
Be persistent.
Keep calm.
If you feel that you are unhappy with your appearance, see a doctor or a health professional and discuss your options.
As for the girl you're pursuing...make sure you like her for the right reasons.

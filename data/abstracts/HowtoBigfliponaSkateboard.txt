Position.
Get some speed.

,
You want to 'wind' your body up slightly before you make the attempt.

,
Then you 'unwind' and begin the pop when your shoulders are parallel with the board.
When you start the rotation with your back-foot, you need to drag the front-foot towards the nose.
Lift the knees up and begin the 180 body varial.
The board should be spinning faster than you.
Once your body and board are straightened out, put your feet down and catch the board.
Ride away clean.

Pace yourself according to how much you can process.Allow yourself about 6 minutes per pagewhen you plan your schedule.
Give yourself breaks to avoid burning out.Proper pacing is incomplete without breaks to relax and recover.
Focus on understanding rather than completeness.
Take plenty of notes.If you do not understand the material you will certainly grow to hate reading it.
Discuss the material with classmates or study mates.

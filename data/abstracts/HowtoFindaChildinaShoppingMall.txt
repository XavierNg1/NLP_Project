Stay calm.
Determine whether out if the child is actually lost.
Think like a child.
Look low.
If you spot your little monkey hiding from you, call your child and perhaps offer a lure such as some candy or even a toy.
Talk to your child about what just happened.
Get help quickly.
Ask a mall security guard, mall employee or mall/store manager for help.
Try to recall if your child tried to go or talk to someone earlier.
Let mall search staff know if you decide to keep searching off your own bat.
Thank the staff for the help when your child is found.
Call the police if the child does not turn up.
Talk to your children about safety when shopping and going out.
Develop a plan of what to do if they get lost.
Never let your child be by him/herself and always keep them in your eye view.

Before adopting any pet, you must be sure you actually want them, and if you can take the responsibility to care for him/her.
Now buy the equipment.
Now you can finally adopt your chickens.
Bring your new chickens home (or have the rescue centre bring them to you).
If you bought multiple chickens, at first they will fight to establish their pecking order.
Feed your chickens treats.
Clean out your chicken coops regularly.
It takes 25 hours for a hen to lay an egg, therefore, a chicken lays an egg everyday except on one day per month (usually, depending on when they start laying) when the hour laps over.
There are many different illnesses a chicken can pick up so keep an eye on your chickens and if one is behaving strangely, separate it from the others so if it is contagious it won't pass on.
Bond with your chickens.

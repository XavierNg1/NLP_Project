Find a thick and very large book that you won't ever want to read again.
Open the book.
Draw a rectangular shape on the next page from the ones flipped over.
Carefully cut out the rectangular hole with the Exacto knife.
With the hole now in the book, use an old painting brush to start coating the inside edges of the hole with glue.
Weight the book down with a few heavy books.
Fill with your goodies.

Don't expect too much.
Know the people you're dealing with.
Beware of NATO behavior.
Confront the person to explain how you feel.
Spread the word to others and tell them to beware of that person.
Don't trust promises from a forgetful person.
Cry on someone else's shoulder if its really getting to you.
Getting disappointed is a huge blow, especially when you set your heart on it.
However, remember that if its not going anywhere, it can get very painful for you.

Comb your hair with a wide-tooth comb.
Part your hair into three sections.
Unclip and wet the section you're doing first.
Pull a wide-tooth comb gently through your damp hair.
Reclip the first section and repeat steps 3-4 with the remaining sections.
Remove all clips and comb the sections together.

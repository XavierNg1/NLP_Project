Acquire a helicopter.
Fly over to the Statue of Happiness, and fly up to the base where the statue stands.
Fly low and jump from the helicopter so you land on the pavilion.
Run around the pavilion, and find the door with faded red marks on the floor.
Walk towards the door and you'll find that you can pass straight through it.

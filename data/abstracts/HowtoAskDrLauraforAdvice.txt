Ask yourself what your dilemma is and why you want Dr. Laura's advice, before you call the show.
Decide as exactly and specifically as possible what your question is going to be, and write it down so you don't forget.

,
Call 1-800-DRLAURA (800-375-2872) between the hours of 11:30 AM and 3 PM Pacific Time Monday through Friday.
Turn your radio off, not down.

,
Be ready with your question.
Keep calm and stick to your original story.

,
Ask her your question first, then give her only the relevant background information and only that which she requests.

,
Answer with only "yes or no", when asked a "yes or no" question.

,
Do not present an ongoing set of never-ending pieces to the story.
Do not begin your sentences with the words "I just", "I feel," "I can't," or "I'll try.",
If she gives a suggestion, don't tell her that you've already tried it.
Think about the conversation you had with Dr. Laura.

Be prepared to give up some of your favorite foods if you're into spicy dishes- such as curry, or hot wings.
For the first few days, most piercers actually suggest you stick to cold, soothing foods, such as ice cream.
You don't realize how often you use your tongue to push food around your mouth as you chew.
After carefully following this regimen for one to two weeks- the time varies from person to person, depending on your immune system, diet, etc.- your tongue should be significantly healed, and able to handle solid food again!

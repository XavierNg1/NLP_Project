Plan ahead.
Seek professional assistance hair coloring.
Do it yourself using quality products.
Use a flat iron to seal your hair color.
Wait before washing your hair.
Use mild, color-treated shampoo and conditioner.
Use a moisture-rich conditioner.
Wash your hair in the coldest water you can stand.
Avoid using harsh soaps, chemicals (especially chlorine), and any shampoo that specializes in "clean" hair.
Redye often, but not too often.

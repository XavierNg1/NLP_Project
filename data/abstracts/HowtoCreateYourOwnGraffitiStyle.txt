Get a lot of paper, some pencils, and a variety of color markers.
Learn the basics of graffiti and practice lots of different styles.
Start by lightly drawing some block letters in pencil.
Erase some parts and add arrows, cracks, bubbles, dents, stars, chips, or whatever you think would suit your design.
Tweak the letters in all kinds of places.
Make some letters hook up with others, and just go crazy!,
Finished.

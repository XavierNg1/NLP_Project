Develop a regular cleaning process.
Remove any obvious product from the brushes first.
Choose anti-bacterial dish washing soap or body wash (the liquid kind works best).
Repeat the process if there is still product on the brushes.
Use a good quality extra virgin oil in addition to gentle dish soap.
Swirl your brush into the oil.
Add dish soap after you are done with the olive oil treatment (or shampoo).
Consider investing in a brush cleaner.
Dry the brushes in the air.
Avoid anything that will harm your makeup brushes.

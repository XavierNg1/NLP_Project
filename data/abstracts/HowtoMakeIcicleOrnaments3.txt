Spread some parchment paper over your work surface.If you don't have any parchment paper, you can use wax paper instead, but be sure to spread a thin layer of dish soap over it.
Insert a hot glue stick into your hot glue gun, and let it heat up.
Draw straight lines on your parchment paper.
Consider shaking some glitter onto your icicles.Do it quickly, or the glue will set, and the glitter won't stick.
Wait 2 to 3 minutes for the hot glue to cool.
Carefully peel the icicles away from the parchment paper.
Tie some thread into a loop, then hot glue it to the top of each icicle.

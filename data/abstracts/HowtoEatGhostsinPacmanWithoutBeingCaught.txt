The ghosts go in different directions, so try to remember their movement patterns.
The place where you have started, go the opposite direction and DON'T go down(instead go up).

,
Keep going up until you have reached the top aisle on the drawing.

,
The red ghost will be the last one to chase you, and the blue one will be the first because you are at the very top.
Go down and eat the fruit in the middle because you have time before they regrow.

,
Whenever you see the Pink or Blue ghost coming for you, go into the tunnels or just eat all the small dots on the bottom of the screen.
To escape Orange Ghosts, you have to always eat the fruit in the middle to make him stunned and he won't chase after you.
To escape Red ghost, just eat the Power Pellet, because even if they have regrown, they run away for 8 seconds, and start chasing you again.

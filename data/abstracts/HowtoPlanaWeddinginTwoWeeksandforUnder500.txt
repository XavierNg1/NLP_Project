Take care of the legal stuff as soon as you decide to get married.
Spread the word.
Find an officiant, but don't look in the phone book first.
Write the ceremony yourselves.
Obtain rings, if you choose to wear them.
Go casual.
Tell everybody to wear jeans and sneakers, sandals and shorts, and their favorite Hawaiian shirt.
Get married in your home, or your backyard, if you can.

,
Have the wedding and the reception in the same place.
Borrow chairs or inquire about renting them.
Keep cleanup simple.
Appoint a "stage manager", if possible.
Keep favors simple, or skip altogether.
Skip the flowers or buy just a few from a supermarket (go for color, not price).
Skip the photographer, unless you know an amateur or hobbyist who is eager to try her hand at it.
Place plenty of trash cans and, if possible, well-marked recycle bins in discreet but visible locations.
Consider doing your own music with wedding CD.

Car A attempts to put the front quarter of the car next to the rear quarter of Car B.
At speeds greater than 70 mph (110 km/h), Car B requires not much more than a good strong kiss from Car A.
After Car A gives the initial tap, Car B's back-end will slide out if enough force was applied.
Be prepared for Car B to try to drive off as soon as it has slowed enough to regain control.
Additional aspects of the maneuver can be added to help Car A.

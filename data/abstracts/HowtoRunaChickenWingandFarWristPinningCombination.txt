From the referee's position, the match starts, and you've broken down your opponent (he/she is flat on the mat).
Once you've got your arms under your opponents' arms, grab his/her wrists and curl your wrists downwards, turning their wrists so that their palms start to face up.

,
At this point, pick a side where you want to use your chicken wing.
Keep the left wrist of your opponent.
This position gives you great leverage on their arm.
Go to place their hand on top of their back, but don't put more of their arm than their wrist and about a third of their forearm (lower arm, between the biceps and the wrist) onto their back.
You now have a chicken wing!,
Elevate your opponent's left arm into the air by using your forearm as a lever to pry their arm up and into the air.
Run your legs in a circle around the front of their head while continuing to crank up and lift the chicken wing.
Finally, once you can't run any farther around their head, sit your legs through.

Gather your supplies.
Find a suitable pillowcase.
Measure your child down from the shoulder to get the length of the dress and add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters).
Cut the pillowcase according to that measurement.
Fold the pillowcase in half vertically.
Cut a J-shaped armhole into the top of the pillowcase.
Pin some single-fold bias tape around the edge of each armhole.
Stitch the bias tape down.
Flip the bias tape inside the pillowcase and topstitch it down.
Fold the top part of the pillowcase twice to make a casing for the ribbon.
Sew the two hems down.
Thread a long piece of ribbon through each casing.
Go over the dress when you are done and check for loose threads.
Put the dress on the child and tie the ribbons into bows.

Cover two large baking sheets with parchment paper or wax paper, and set them aside.
Add the chocolate chips or butterscotch chips into a small saucepan.
Melt the chips over medium heat, stirring often with a spatula.
Remove the saucepan from heat, and set it down onto a heat-safe surface.
Add the chow mein noodles and the nuts to the saucepan.
Use a spoon to scoop the mixture onto the baking sheets.
Put the trays into the fridge for 1 to 2 hours so that the haystacks can cool and harden.
Transfer the haystacks to a serving plate.
Serve the haystacks, and store any leftovers in an airtight container.

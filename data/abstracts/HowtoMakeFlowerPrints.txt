Collect flowers.
Set up the paper you're going to print on.
Paint the underside of the flower with paint.
Gently place the leaf onto the paper, paint-side facing down.
Move a paint roller over the top of the flower.
Lift the roller up quickly and carefully.
Repeat.
Allow the print to dry before using or hanging.

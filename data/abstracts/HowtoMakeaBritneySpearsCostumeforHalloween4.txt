,
Wear any lacy white corset on top, preferably with ruffles.
Get a plain white miniskirt and wear it high enough so that the lacy edges of your dress peek through the bottom unevenly.
Adorn several white beaded necklaces of varying shapes and lengths above your dress.
Wear silver bangles (thick and thin both work, or a combination of the two) and white bracelets.
This outfit is best with medium-length hair that doesn't smother the intricate dress.
Makeup should be simple.

Once you start the game, wait until it is nighttime and get a ride down to a community lot.
Alternatively, you could cheat.
Remember that whenever there's sunlight around, don't even think about taking your vampire Sims outside, unless you want to pay the consequences.
Note that after the sun sets, the vampires rise and head out to enjoy the comfortable, non-dangerous, nighttime environment.
To cure it, call over the matchmaker, or if you have Apartment Life, you can summon a witch with the potion and purchase the Vamprocillin-D potion.

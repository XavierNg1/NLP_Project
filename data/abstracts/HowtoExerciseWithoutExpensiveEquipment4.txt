Start the first week by doing as many push-ups as you can COMFORTABLY DO.
Repeat your set of pushups as many times a day as you can comfortably do.
Make sure your push-up form is correct.
Make sure that you get a lot of water to stay hydrated.
Once you can do your normal number several times a day, add a few more push-ups to your routine.
If you do this for at least a week or two you will see results and will be stronger.
Do pushups nearly anywhere.

We need to understand that our decision making is a very complex process, encompassing not only our knowledge and desire, but also much input from other sources.
We need to learn to sort through and decide what input we will allow to influence our decisions and reject or disallow those sources that cause us to choose to do wrong.
We need to equip ourselves with the Enforcer to back us up as we eject evil voices that speak into our lives; freeing us to choose to do the right thing.
We need to surround ourselves with reinforcements to make this admittedly difficult task easier.
Practice, practice, practice.

Preheat your oven to 400°F (205°C) and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place a tablespoon-sized mound of Parmesan cheese onto the baking sheet.
Flatten the mound until it is 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) wide.
Continue making similar mounds on your baking sheet.
Sprinkle the freshly ground black pepper on top of the mounds.
Bake the crisps in the center rack of the oven for 3 to 5 minutes.
Allow the crisps to cool on the baking sheet before removing them with a thin, metal spatula.If the crisps are too oily, set them down onto a sheet of paper towel so that they can drain.Once the crisps have cooled to room temperature, you can serve them.

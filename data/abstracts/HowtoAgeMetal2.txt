Find a galvanized or grey metal object.
Sand the surface of the metal with a sander or sanding block.
Place the metal object in an open or well-ventilated area.
Pour an acid toilet bowl cleaner on the metal.Hold the bottle with one hand and move the metal so the liquid pours over the surface of the metal until it is completely coated.
Allow the cleaner to sit on the object in a fairly even layer for 30 minutes.
Rinse off the metal object.

Make sure you have what you need.
Have a template.
Once you have downloaded the template.
Once you are happy with the position of you logo / logos you are ready to print your artwork.
Now that you have printed your page it should look something like this.
Next step is to cut out your designs with your scissors or art knife and ruler.
Now we are ready to position our print onto our sublimation mug.
Now adjust your pressure setting on your mug press so that when you clap your mug in the press it have medium to heavy pressure on it.
Now plug in your mug press and set the temperature for 400F / 204C and the timer for 180 seconds and let it preheat to the required temperature.
Once the time is up release the pressure off the press and remove the mug by the handle followed by picking the edge of one the the bits of heat tape on one end of the paper with your fingernail then peeling the paper off the mug in one smooth movement.
Now place you mug on a heat proof surface until it has cooled down enough to handle.

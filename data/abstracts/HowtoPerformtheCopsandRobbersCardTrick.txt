Get a hold of a normal deck of cards.
Prepare the deck.
Speak to your audience.
Say, "The rest of the deck is the bank".
Say, "The first robber goes in through the basement".
Say, "The foolish robber goes int through the front door".
Say, "Now the last robber goes in through the roof, where the cop goes in after him.",
Say, "At that very moment, there was an earthquake, so they got mixed up!",
Look through the deck.

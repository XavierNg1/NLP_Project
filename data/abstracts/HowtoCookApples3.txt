Cut off the tops of two apples, then scoop the cores out using a spoon or melon scoop.
In a bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
Spoon the sugar mixture into each apple.
Add a cube of butter on top of the sugar.
Place the apples into a microwave-safe dish, and cover them with some plastic wrap.
Microwave the apples for 3Â½ to 4 minutes.
Let the apples sit for a few minutes before removing the plastic wrap and serving them.

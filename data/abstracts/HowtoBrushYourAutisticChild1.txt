Purchase a soft, surgical brush with bristles that will not scratch or harm your child.
Plan on brushing your child for three to five minutes a day for six to eight times a day.
Brush in firm horizontal strokes along your child's arms, back, legs and soles of their feet.
Observe how your child reacts to the brushing.

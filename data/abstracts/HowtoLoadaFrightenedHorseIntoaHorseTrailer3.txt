Know that you can't just expect your horse to do what you tell them when you tell them if the result is often negative.
Walk into the trailer and ask your horse to follow.
Praise each step forward.
If your horse successfully loads, make sure to tie him/her up and close the trailer, so that they do not automatically equate loading with getting out.

If you wish to try this exercise again, give your horse a few minutes before reloading.

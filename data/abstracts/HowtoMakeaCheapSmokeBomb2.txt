Go out to a densely wooded area.
Gather as much Moss as possible.
Lump the dry lichen and moss together.

,
Get some twine of any length over 5 inches (12.7Â cm), give or take.
Bundle it into either one large loose ball shaped mass or multiple small ones.
Get some more twine in a length of 10+ inches and this time only "loosen it up".

,
Take the loosened twine and soak small parts of it in a flammable liquid (lighter fluid, gas, oil?, etc.),
Use the loosened twine to gently bind up the loose ball shaped lichen/moss/twine fiber mass.
Tie the loose twine ends together in a Square Knot.
Set it outside somewhere.

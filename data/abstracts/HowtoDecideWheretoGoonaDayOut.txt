Just go somewhere.
Keep on visiting different nature areas that you know of locally.
After a few days kids, being kids, will get fed up of the beautiful fresh air and forest views so you can try something a little more suited to them, but remembering that you need fun too.
You can arrange a BBQ with all your closest friends that have kids, and party with some karaoke maybe?,
As a special treat towards the end of summer you can arrange a day trip with your kids friends and their moms to a theme park.

Draw five long ovals on one half, representing ships.

Let your opponent do the same on the other half.
To fire, mark a dot anywhere on your side.
Fold the paper over, as shown.

If you did it correctly, you should be able to faintly see the dot you made (in step 4) on the reverse side.
Continue as your opponent fires, and then you fire, and again he fires etc.

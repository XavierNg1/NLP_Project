Cover a large baking sheet with wax paper.
Heat the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a saucepan over medium to high heat.
Wait until the mixture reaches 300°F (148.9°C).It will take about 20 minutes.
Remove the saucepan from heat, and stir in the gel food coloring and vanilla extract using a rubber spatula.The candy coating will be translucent once it hardens on the apple.
Wait for the candy mixture to cool and the bubbles, if any, to disappear before dipping the first apple into it.Quickly dip the apple into the candy, then pull it out.
Turn the apple upside down for a few seconds before setting it down onto the baking sheet.
Continue dipping the apples and placing them on the sheet until you have none left.
Wait for the candy to harden.

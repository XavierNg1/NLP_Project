Set the right sort of trap.Use a small, live cage trap and set it in a corner or other "safe," hidden area of the attic.
Use the right sort of bait.Squirrels will not go near a trap unless you have some rather appetizing food inside.
Relocate the squirrels.
Keep the traps in place until all squirrels are out.

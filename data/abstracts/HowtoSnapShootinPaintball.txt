Always maintain a balanced platform.
Stand facing your bunker.
Figure out where your opponent is.
Quickly lean out of your bunker so that only about half of your head, your hands that are holding your marker, and the marker itself is exposed.
As soon as your opponent's balls either fly past or hit your bunker, snap out again and repeat.

,If the snapping is more drawn out than five or ten seconds, as soon as your opponent goes behind his bunker, quickly move to another bunker to get a better shot on him

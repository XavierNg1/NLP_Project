If you're getting bored with the options in Sims 4, you can look for custom content, or CC.
Once you find something you're interested in, make sure it's compatible with your game.
Make sure you don't need the actual piece of clothing itself from another download, or the 'mesh'.
Download the file and extract it.
Locate the Mods folder for the Sims 4.
Find the .package file of the CC you are using along with any additional meshes you might need, and simply place them in the Mods folder.
Be creative!

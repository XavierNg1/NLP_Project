Accept that it is over for good.
Realize that they simply did not have the faith and courage to stand up for themselves and their beliefs for love, and simply succumbed to the societal and family limitations of what defines a marriage.
Erase all texts, e-mails, pictures, phone numbers of this person.
Work out your steps as you move on, it can be hard because you had so perfectly carved out a future with this person.
Do not self destruct - this means binge drinking, indulging in drug habits, a sudden pattern of chain smoking, getting into a rebound relationship, inflicting self injury; and other things that cause you to lose yourself even further.
Writing down your thoughts and feelings is one proven way to help you deal with it.
See a counselor or a therapist, this does not mean you are crazy or suffering from some mental illness.
Travel, nothing like a good vacation to help you take your mind off things.
Most break ups are healed with the help of friends and family.
Resist the temptation to look back and find out what your ex and their friends are up to.
When things are broken, it makes you realize what you don't want and what you need.
Life this is, and move on we must.
Ending an inter religious relationship/marriage is horrible, and is overly sensitive to deal with.
Good luck and calm down!

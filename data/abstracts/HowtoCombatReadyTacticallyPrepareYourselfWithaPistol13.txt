Feeding Above all, the first consideration should be, "Does this bullet feed reliably in my chosen firearm?",
Jacketed hollow-point (JHP) bullets are almost universally considered the best choice for defense ammunition.
Solid FMJ bullets do not have the problem of losing their energy as quick and are known for penetrating through barriers and still piercing deep enough into flesh to arrive at vital organs.
Bullet weight is another thing to consider.
Powder loads can change a bullet's ballistics and the gun's feel.
Practicing with the ammunition you intend to use for self defense can get expensive.

Detune your sixth string to a D. Assuming your guitar is in standard tuning, use your third string as a reference tone and drop your thickest string to a D. Your third string is an octave higher than the target note you're going for, but the tone is the same.
Find the reference tones for the rest of your strings.
Drop your sixth string to a C. Because your fourth open string is now a C, you can use it to drop your sixth string to a C and finish tuning your guitar.

Plan your project.
Choose your paint.
Decide if you want to use stencils or decals to accentuate the bat, or if you need to mask off parts of it with tape.
Prepare the bat.
Use masking tape to protect any surfaces, such as gripping surfaces on the handle, or the label, that you do not want to paint over.

,
Prime the wood with a good primer.
Sand the primer lightly with a very fine grit sandpaper, and only sufficiently to remove runs or drips.
Spray your finished paint on the bat, using good technique for good results.
Allow the paint to dry and cure thoroughly when you are done.

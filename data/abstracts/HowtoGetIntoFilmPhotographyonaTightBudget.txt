Buy a camera and lens cheaply.

Shoot colour negative film.

Stick to 35mm.

Buy lots of film.

Don't buy a scanner.

Shoot film for what it's best at.

Get out when the light is good.

Think before you shoot.

Shoot a frame at a time.
If you are unsure about exposure, such as with a backlit subject, err toward overexposure with color print film (unless the shutter speed would have to be so slow as to cause blur).
Don't get prints.

Go for a longer development time.

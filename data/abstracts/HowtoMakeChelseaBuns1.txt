Warm up the milk and 2 tablespoons butter on the stove until warm and liquid.
Whisk together 2 cups of sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, package yeast, and 2 tablespoons sugar in a large mixing bowl.
Create a well (hole) in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the milk/butter mixture, plus the beaten egg.
Combine the dough with a wooden spoon, then knead for 10 minutes.
Place in a lightly greased bowl, covered, to rise for an hour.
Grease a rimmed baking sheet.
Flatten and roll the dough into a rectangle on a floured service.
Soften 3 tablespoons of butter and spread evenly on the dough.
Mix up the brown sugar, currants, and cinnamon and then spread evenly on the butter.
Roll the entire dough rectangle up along the long side, leaving you with raw dough roll.
Cut perpendicular to the roll to make nice individual rounds.
Set the rolls in your greased dish and let them rise for another 30 minutes.
Cook your buns for 20-25 minutes at 400F, or until golden brown.
Apply your glaze right out of the oven, then eat while still hot.

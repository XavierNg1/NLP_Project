Understand how snakes tend to react.
Keep calm and keep your distance.
Stand still if the snake has caught you unawares and you're too close to it.
Identify the snake if possible.
If you can identify the snake and you are positive that it is non-venomous, make a decision about whether or not to chase it out of the garden.

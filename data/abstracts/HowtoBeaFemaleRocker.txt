Learn about the attitude.
Know that you don't have to get wasted, take drugs or be promiscuous to be a rocker.
Like the bands you like.
Clothes do not make the rocker.
Don't be mean to other people because you think it's tough.
Don't try to fail all your tests/exams to look hard.
Check out new local bands, or start one of your own.
Don't limit yourself to just one type of rock, try everything.

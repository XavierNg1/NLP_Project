Structure your speech with a beginning, middle and end.Speeches are like oral essays.
Include a take-home message.
Keep time in mind.While great speakers will keep their speaking pace relaxed and take cares not to speed up, you should respect the time of your audience.
Rehearse your speech.Nothing great ever came about without hard work and practice.
Thank your audience once the speech is over.Even if you're the one who is performing, your audience members are taking time out of their schedules to hear you speak about your topic.

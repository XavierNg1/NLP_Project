Learn how to braid and French braid.
Begin with tangle-free clean hair.
Part your hair to either side.
Create a part for the hair you want to be in the headband, using a comb, pencil, pointy end of a makeup brush, fingernail, or something similar.
Put the hair that will not be braided (the majority of it) into a ponytail or clip.
Begin French braiding.
Continue French braiding until you've used all the loose hair in the braid.
Finish it up.
Finished.

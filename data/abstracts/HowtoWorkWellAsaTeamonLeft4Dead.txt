Find a group of teammates who have rounded skills, but can excel in certain situations.
Don't all use the same weapons, this will handicap the team in certain scenarios, and could cost you one of your teammates.
Stick together, the game engine sends more zombies after players who run from the group, and you won't want to be constricted when you are far away from your friends/saviors.

Cover all doorways and entrances, the last thing you want is zombie attacking you from behind, because someone didn't cover their entry point.

,
When clearing a building, or anywhere, be sure to look around all of the doorways, and check inside the rooms, you never know if something will be stood behind the door, and attack you when you are not aware.

If you are moving altogether, make sure that anyone at the front is crouching, you don't want to take friendly fire whilst you are being swarmed.

If you are the first person leading then crouch as this allows your team mates to shoot over your head at enemies.

When facing more dangerous enemies, be sure to use the following tactics:


Tanks

These are giant mutated zombies, they will stop at nothing to reach you, and they will also throw objects at you.
These are the available weapons found in safe houses and in between them.

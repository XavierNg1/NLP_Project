Be aware of the heightened risk of flu-related complications.When an older child or adult catches the flu, it is usually not that big of a deal.
Have your baby treated with Tamiflu (an anti-viral flu medication).If your baby or young child has the flu, it is important to bring him or her to a doctor immediately.
Watch for complications from the flu.Complications are much more likely to develop from the flu in babies than in adults.

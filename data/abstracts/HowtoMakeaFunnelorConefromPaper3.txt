Cut out a wide triangle.If the common disc method isn't to your liking, you can make a cone shape starting out with a paper triangle.
Roll the far corners of your paper into the centre.Take one of the far corners and roll it into the centre so that the paper's edge is touching the middle of your triangle.
Make adjustments to your cone.Unless the rolls were perfect, chances are you'll have to shift the paper around a bit in order to make the cone even.
Fold the loose edges into the cone's opening.
Tape the cone.

Assemble the needles with the needle holder (optional).
Ready the double-pointed needle with a clean needle for blood-drawing.
Restrain the animal.
Find the jugular furrow and "tap" the jugular vein.
Put the blood-letting needle into the vein.
While the blood-letting needle remains in the vein, attach a vaccutainer tube to the needle on the inside of the double-needle holder (see step 1).
Once you have obtained your sample, remove the vaccutainer tube from the needle-holder unit.
Apply pressure to stop the bleeding.
Cap the outside needle, and remove it into a biohazard disposal box.
Label the tube.
Place tube back in the box.
Repeat for other cattle.

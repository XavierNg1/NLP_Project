Before you start this (or any other) digging project, call 811, A new, federally-mandated national "Call Before You Dig" number.
Be careful to center the hole on the position for the pier.
This is the completed hole.
Fill the bottom with about one inch of gravel, sand or pea gravel.
Compact the gravel at the bottom of the hole.
Place the paver in the bottom of the hole and check for level by placing a post with square cut ends on the paver.
Once the paver is level in all directions it is time to determine the pier length.
Use a radial, or chop saw to cut the piers to length.
Once the pier is cut to length recheck the height by laying the level on the ledger and the top of the pier.

,
Locate the pier by measuring from two known points.
Once you have the exact location, mark the bottom of the pier with a felt pen on the paver.
Carefully fill the hole with loose dirt until it is 4 inches (10.2 cm) deep in the entire hole.
Carefully tamp the dirt with another pier or post while holding onto the pier to prevent it from moving.
Fill the remaining dirt 4 inches (10.2 cm) at a time and compact.
Use the extra dirt to create a sloped cap around the pier to discourage water from collecting near the pier.

Your efforts should result in a level aligned resting place for the beam.

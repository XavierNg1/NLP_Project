Gather your yarn, knitting needles, and a place to put them.
Create a pattern on graph paper or a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel that is 20 squares across and however many squares tall as you need to create a pattern.
Choose which yarn color you will start with.
Make four rows of stitches on the scarf for every one row in your pattern.
Make the next four scarf rows, but refer to the next row in the pattern.
Cast off when the scarf has reached the desired length.

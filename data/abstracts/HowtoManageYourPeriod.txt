Tell your mother!,
If you are young or this is your first period, sanitary napkins (pads) would be the best option.
If you use tampons: unwrap the packaging, make sure the string are hanging down and insert the tampon about half a finger up your vagina.
Keep the supplies next to the toilet in your bathroom, or in your bedroom.
Your period may consist of about 2-3 heavy days, 2-3 medium days and 1-2 light days.
Keep buying different brands of sanitary napkins/ tampons until you find the one that you like best.

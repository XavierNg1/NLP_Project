Choose a thick cut of meat.
Resist the temptation to outfit your filet with additional rubs or smother it in marinades.
Decide whether to salt the filet before or after grilling.
Wait for the filet to come to room temperature.
If possible, use lump charcoal over briquettes and try to stay away from gas grills.
Position your coals to form a hot side and a cool side in your grill.
Brush your filet with a little bit of oil.
Decide whether to cook your filet primarily over high heat or low heat.
Cook your filet over indirect, "cool" heat until the filet is about 15° - 20° F from your ideal temperature.
For a medium-rare filet, transfer it over to the direct, "hot" side of the grill when its temperature reaches 110° to 115° F. Sear the meat on both sides, using tongs to flip the filet when necessary.








,
Remove the filet when its internal temperature is 5° F away from its ideal temperature.
Make sure to let the steak rest for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting into it.
Pepper your steak generously.
Serve and enjoy your perfectly cooked king of steaks.

Gather all of your ingredients and items necessary for making the fudge and serving it.
Using your saucepan, melt your butter or margarine in it on low heat and stir it until it has melted completely.
Clip a small candy or weather thermometer to the side of the saucepan and keep stirring the mixture.
Remove the mixture from the saucepan at this point and put it into a bowl.
Immediately after, transfer the mixture into the pan that you made space for in your fridge.
Place the pan containing the fudge into the fridge and check it every once in a while to ensure that it is cooling off.
Enjoy your snack!,
Finished.

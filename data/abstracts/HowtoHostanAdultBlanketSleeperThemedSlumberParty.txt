Plan in some fun and blanket-sleeper safe pre-sleepover activities you can do while dressed in your sleepers.

Allow ample enough parking areas for your invitees and their parents to park.
Decorate the rooms a bit to provide the theme for the party and sleeping areas.

Prepare some party favors for all of your invited attendees, and keep a few more on hand for any others that may have come uninvited and ready to attend the slumber party.

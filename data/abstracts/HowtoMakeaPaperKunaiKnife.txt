Get two square pieces of paper, preferably black construction paper.
Holding the smaller square, fold one corner to the opposite side.
Fold a crease halfway through the paper.
Unfold the paper.
Take one of the short sides of the triangle (not the long one) and fold the edge to the middle.
Keep folding repeatedly until you can't fold it anymore.
Squish the paper from top to bottom so that it creates a kunai shape (grasp by edges and press).
Take the larger square paper and roll it into a thin tube for the handle.
Insert the tube into the hole.
Wrap your hand around the section of the tube next to the blade.
Use a series of folds and reverse folds on the flat side of the tube to create a circle.
Tape the circle so that it stays.
Tape or staple the tube into the back of the kunai (where the hole is).
Take something heavy and put it inside the knife so that it can fly better.
Seal the kunai with thick tape so that the heavy object doesn't come flying out when you throw it.
Finished.

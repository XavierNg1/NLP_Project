Take a 5- to 6-inch (13- to 15-centimeter) clipping from a mature plant in the spring or early summer.
Remove most of the leaves.
Dip the end of the stem in rooting hormone and shake off the excess.
Fill small cups or plastic seedling trays with potting soil.
Place the cutting 2 inches (5 centimeters) deep in the potting medium.
Wet the soil using a gentle spray.
Keep the cutting in a warm spot, located in shade to indirect partial sun as it develops.
Gently tug on the cutting after one to five weeks.

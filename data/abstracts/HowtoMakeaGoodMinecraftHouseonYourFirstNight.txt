Once you spawn, look around.Punch a tree and collect about 25 birch logs and about 35 oak logs.
Make a wooden pickaxe then mine a fair bit of cobblestone and and make a stone set.
Make a frame, a 5x3x3 box of oak wood.
Make a hole in the wall for a door, on the edge of the box, one block in on the left.
One block across from the door, make a hole 2 long 1 wide 2 high.
Add some birch slabs around the left corner, just above the door.
Place some birch fences going down the sides of where the door is.Place 2 dirt blocks underneath the 2 long windows.Add trapdoors around the dirt blocks and wait for them to grow into grass.

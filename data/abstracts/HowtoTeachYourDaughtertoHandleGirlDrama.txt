Teach your daughter from an early age that drama is not desirable.
Teach her about morals.
Remind your daughter that she has resources.
Make sure your daughter understands that her worth does not come from her social standing.
If it's apparent that your daughter is going through something at school or with friends, try to gather information.
If the issue seems to be serious, which might be evidenced in a dramatic change in your daughter's behavior (for example, she used to be the life of the party but now hides in her room frequently) consider discussing with a school administrator or child counselor.
If the issue is painful but not incredibly serious, consider distractions.
If you notice that one girl in particular is causing drama in your daughter's life, help your daughter make other friends or have a discussion with that girl's parent.
Talk to your daughter and help her process what has happened to her.

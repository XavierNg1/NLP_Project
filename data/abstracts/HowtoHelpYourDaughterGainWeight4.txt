Don't make fun of fat people.
Avoid remarking on your daughter's weight or eating habits.
Love your body.
Listen to your daughterâ€”not only about her weight, but about everything.
Check up with her on the psychological front.
Don't push her to gain weight.
Take her to a doctor if she is is severely underweight, or if she has been strictly restricting her diet.

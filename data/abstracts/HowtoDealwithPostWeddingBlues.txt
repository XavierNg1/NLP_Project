Understand that you are not alone.
Honor your feelings.
Put things in perspective as much as possible.
Understand that your wedding or a marriage does not define your value as a person.
Remember that no wedding in the history of the world has taken place exactly as planned.
Consider a partial "do-over".
Remember that weddings are typically a lot more enjoyable for guests than for the bridal couple.
Consider your expectations for your relationship.
Think of all the things you overcame to get to where you are.
Look forward to the many things yet awaiting you.
Remind yourself of these things often.
Seek professional help.

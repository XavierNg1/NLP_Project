Make sure the person you intend to kiss is comfortable with it.
After meeting lips with the person your kissing, keep your eyes closed until the kiss ends.
Move the tip of your tongue around the tip of theirs or sort of lick their tongue with your own.
If the other person bites you or vice versa, laugh lightly and continue the kiss like nothing happened.
If you want to take a break for a few moments, then resume kissing, simply pull away and smile at the person you were kissing or lean into them and hug them or take their hand and go back for another kiss.

,
If you want to stop altogether but not break away, simply cuddle for a while.

Choose a subject to draw and how large you want it to be.
Once you have chosen a subject, get out some paper to draw on.
Take two sheets of the paper you have chosen: one for testing on, the other for the actual composition.
Lightly sketch an outline of the subject on the main paper with a pencil so that you can erase the lines if you made a mistake.
Add colors to your drawing with your oil pastels.
Add more layers of colors to blend them together.
Have fun.
Finished.

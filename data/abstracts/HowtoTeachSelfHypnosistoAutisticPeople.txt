Find out what the young teen likes and finds relaxing such as woods versus water, sounds, colors, and more.
Do the relaxation and breathing exercises first.

,
Suggest that the teen lay back in any position that is the most comfortable.

,
Ask the young man or woman to shut their eyes.

,
If music is to be used, which is often preferable, turn on the music softly in the background.

,
Regress the person.
Ensure that you are consistent.
Use a five or ten count.
Use what you learned during the preparatory steps.
Move deeper into "self" and the vision with each step.
Build in a safety assurance.
Make a recording for the individual.
Very clearly use an end of self-hypnosis statement.Add in the recording a clear statement to remain in the highly relaxed state, but also a slightly louder and clear end point when you will begin the return to the present.
Make a statement that you will be moving back to the present.
Use the same five to ten steps you used initially in regression, but in reverse.
Use the five or ten count reversed.
Complete the steps, bringing the person back to the present.
Tell the person to open his/her eyes slowly.
Include this, of course, in the recording as well.

,
Create a physical cue, not otherwise used, as the relaxation response trigger.
Decide upon a physical symbol to trigger the response.
Create the cue as something that would ordinarily not just happen.
Reinforce this embedded response many times during hypnosis.

,
When not regressed, remind the person that this type of touch will help them to feel calm.

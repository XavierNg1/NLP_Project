Repurpose: When we find a new use for an old thing, rather than just throwing it away, we’re keeping it out of a landfill and also cutting costs.
Recycle: If your town has a recycling program, participate!,
Hand-Down: Small children don’t stay small for long, so they typically outgrow their clothes before they wear them out so consider reusing them for the next child.
Plant a garden and put a dent in your summer grocery bill, reduce your carbon footprint, and make the world a little greener — literally.
Buy from a local farm or farmer’s market if you don’t have a green thumb, but still want to be green.

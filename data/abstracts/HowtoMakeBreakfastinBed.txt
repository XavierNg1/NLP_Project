Get a tray that has small sides on it.
Decide what you'll make for breakfast.
Prepare the breakfast as quietly as possible, if there's a chance you might wake the person up.
Pour any liquids only 3/4 of the way.
Add some nice touches:


Lay a single flower down on the tray, or sprinkle flower petals across the tray.
When you bring the breakfast, put it aside while you prepare the area.
Turn on the television, play music, or give the person something to read while they eat.
When they're done, clean up.

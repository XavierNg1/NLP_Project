Follow these general guidelines to help you build your retirement savings depending on the number of years until you would retire.
If you start saving in your 20s:


Save between 10 percent and 15 percent of your income for your retirement investments.
If you start saving in your 30s:


Save between 15 percent and 25 percent of your income for your retirement investments.
If you start saving in your early 40s:


Save between 25 percent and 35 percent of your income for your retirement investments.
If you start saving in your mid-40s and older:

Get out of "risk based" investments by your early fifties: About 10 years before your planned retirement age put all funds in fixed income, "safe" investments.

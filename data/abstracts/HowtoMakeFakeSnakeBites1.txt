Unwind a bit of the wire spiral binding from the notebook.
Cut two rings from the exposed wire.Ideally, the two ends should overlap slightly so that you will have room to bend the wires back.
Shape the rings.
Bend back the ends of each ring with the pliers.
Reshape the rings.
Try on your snake bites to see how they fit!

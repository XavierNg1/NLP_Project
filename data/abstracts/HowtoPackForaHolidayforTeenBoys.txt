Begin by gathering the clothes you want to take on your trip.
Gather your toiletries next.
Find or buy anything else that you will wear or need on your trip.
Instead of folding your clothes roll each one of them separately and place them one on top of another(for more space) and put them in the bag you plan to check or put in the trunk of the car.
Pack the carry-on.
Make a list of all the stuff that you have put in your suitcase and carry on what you need to put--just in case you get a feeling that you have forgotten something in the place you were staying in during the holiday just when you're about to leave for home.


,
Tie a ribbon or make a mark on the suitcase with your initials to be sure that it's yours.

,
Buy a good lock for your suitcase.

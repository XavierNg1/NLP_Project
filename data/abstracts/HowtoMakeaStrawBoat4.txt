Make an Egyptian Sailor (method above) with only one castle and no oars.
Use a piece of paper and cut out a long rectangle.
Cut a circle bigger than the bottom of the nest and tape it at the bottom.Tape it to the mast, the door should be facing outwards.
Make a ladder up to the crow's nest:

Cut a long piece of paper long enough to reach from the bottom of your ship to the door of the crow's nest.
Test it in water.
Try an optional addition:

Use the mast technique from above to put in a small piece of straw at the castle-less front of the boat.

Wash your hands.Before attempting to clean a cut, either on yourself or on another person, it is key that your own hands be clean.
Stop the bleeding.Before cleaning the cut, it is also key to stop the bleeding.
Rinse the wound with clear water.Assuming that you have achieved hemostasis (which is the medical word for stopping the bleeding), you can proceed with steps to clean the cut.
Remove any foreign material from the cut.Use tweezers if needed to get out any debris from the site of the wound.
Apply an antibiotic cream or ointment.Once you have cleaned the wound and removed any debris, apply an antibiotic cream or ointment such as Polysporin over the injured area.
Cover the cut with a bandage.Place a bandage over the cut to first of all hold the cream or ointment in place, and secondly to protect the wound from any further damage.
Consider the date of your last tetanus immunization.The risk of contracting a tetanus infection is highest with puncture wounds, or with wounds that contain foreign material in them.

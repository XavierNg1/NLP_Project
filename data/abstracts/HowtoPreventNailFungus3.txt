Know what medications are available if you do develop a fungal infection.If you get a fungal infection on your toenails or fingernails, you can see your doctor for some oral antifungal medications.
Try topical nail treatments.Most topical agents cannot penetrate the nail plate and cure rates are less than 10%.
Ask about oral medications.
Try combination therapy.
Opt for surgical nail removal.For fungal infections that are extremely severe and/or painful, and that cannot be resolved with medical treatments alone, surgery is an option.
Consider an alternative approach to treating nail fungus.
Note that repeat infections are common.Even after you have cleared up and successfully treated your fungal infection, it is still important to practice preventative measures to diminish the risk of the infection recurring.

Find a decent size tank depending on how many cockroachesÂ you have.
Use a bark substrate for the floor which you can get from most pet shops that stock exotic pets.
Give them some hiding spots in the tank.
Think about the temperature.
Mist your cockroach's tank with a small sprayer which you can pick up anywhere, daily.

Provide them with food.
For extra water, cut up a small bit of sponge and place it in a bottle lid and fill it with water.
Don't worry too much about cleaning.

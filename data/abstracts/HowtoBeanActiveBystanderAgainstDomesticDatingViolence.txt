Know what domestic violence is: a pattern of abusive and coercive behavior, in which a person establishes or maintains power and control over their partner.
Understand dating violence: since domestic violence is often portrayed and stigmatized as physical abuse occurring within a marriage, a home or a family, it is important to explain that abuse occurs on a much broader scale than that.
Note the use of both victim and survivor.
Consider whether they're isolated.
Look for signs of limited independence.
Beware of privacy violations.
Look out for humiliation.
Beware of signs of harassment.
Listen for sexist stereotypes.
Consider whether intimidation is occurring.
Listen for threats.
Don't blame the victim/survivor.
Help them plan for their safety.
Consider whether they want a protection order.
Reach out to others, if they want you to.
Create a plan for when their partner's anger begins to escalate so that they can get out of harm's way.
If you can, be there to listen to them even if the cycle of abuse is repeating.
Stay in touch.

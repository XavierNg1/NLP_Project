Plan your visit.
Understand that whilst Ranbow's End is New Zealand's premier theme park, it's also NZ's only theme park and nothing like internationally recognised parks such Disney World.
Check the park's website or local media to find out about special events.
Decide which attractions you most want to visit.
Ride Stratosfear.
Take a turn on Invader.
Try Fearfall.
Ride Power Surge.
Roll and coast!,
Try out the exciting and slightly less extreme rides.
Drive the Bumper Boats or Family Karts, see a show in the Motion Master or see if you can get lucky at the Future-tainment Arcade or Crazy Sideshows.

Remember If you've got under the age of eight to entertain, they'll likely love the Space Shuttles, Carwash Convoy, Carousel and other 'kiddie' rides and attractions.
Determine your budget.
Look for advanced deals.
Take your own food and drinks if you wish.
Keep in mind the park offers birthday party packages, conferences and meeting options, team building packages as well as both night and day packages.

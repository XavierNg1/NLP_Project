Start by simply following the chords the guitarist is using.
Use the other notes in the power chords to form little riffs.
Keep the baseline moving to give the song drive and power.
Vary your picking style for different effects and sounds.
Set your amp for a clean style that cuts through the distortion of the guitar.

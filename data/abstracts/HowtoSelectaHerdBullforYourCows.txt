Identify the breed, strengths and weaknesses of your cowherd.
Identify the type of bull you wish to have based on its breed.
Decide what breed of bull you wish to buy.
Start looking for advertisements of bull sales, bulls for sale, dispersal sales, etc.
Before you go over to the farm or ranch that are holding these bulls that are for sale, you must come prepared.
Typically the seller will give you a sheet with the bull's EPD's (Expected Progeny Differences) written on it.
Now you are able to have a look at this bull.
Set a price-ceiling based on what you believe is the best price for this bull according to breed, breeding, conformation and genetic qualities.
Once you've found the bull with pretty well everything you want in him and bought him for the price you wanted and expected, now you can take him home and turn him out with the cows.

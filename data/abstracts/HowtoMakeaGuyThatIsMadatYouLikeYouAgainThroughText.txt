Step into his perspective.
Empathize.
Apologize.
Show that you understand the impact your actions had on him.
Avoid escalating the situation.

Make him smile.
Let him know you’re thinking about him.
Know when to back off.
Don’t press him if he won’t tell you why he’s mad.
Know when to give up.
Know when it’s not worth it.
Get some satisfaction.
Move on.

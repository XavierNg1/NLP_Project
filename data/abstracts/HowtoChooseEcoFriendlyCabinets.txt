Consider buying previously used cabinets or refinishing your own cabinets.
Research cabinet companies in your area, or attend home improvement shows if you plan to replace your cabinets.
Decide if you want stock, semi-custom or custom cabinets.
Choose your eco-friendly materials in stock, semi-custom or custom options.
Check on the finishing products that were used on all cabinet materials.
Research if your cabinet choice is recognized by the Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association Environment Stewardship Program (ESP).
Choose a local wood supplier/cabinet company, if possible.
Invest in durable materials.
Recycle your old cabinetry, instead of dumping it in a landfill.

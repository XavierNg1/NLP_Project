Hide.
Assume a proper fighting stance if the assailant will not stop.
Know how to block an attack.
Know how to counterattack.
Know how to make a proper fist.
Appear strong.
Be aware of your surroundings.
Be on the defensive.
Get in a fighting stance if the person just won't leave you alone.
Grab your attacker by the hair/head with your attacking hand, and bring your defending foot up so that you can bring down the attacker's face and smash it on your bent knee.
Punch - hard - with your strong arm right into the opponent's nose.
If you are jumped upon from behind, with the attacker wrapping his or her arms around your waist and chest, yank your arms free and with the arm that is on the same side as the attacker's head is on your shoulder (they need to do this to get closer to you), smash an elbow into his or her face.
If you are grabbed on from behind,step forward and then move backwards and to the side simultaneously, this should throw the attacker off balance and you will literally throw him or her over your shoulder.
If he or she grabs your arm with his or her hand, straighten your fingers as if you were trying to make your hand as flat as possible, and pull against where his or her fingers are.
If you are getting jumped,try not to get thrown on the ground or you will find it difficult to defend yourself from the attacker.

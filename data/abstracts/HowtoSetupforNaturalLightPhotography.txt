Put your subject where you think you want them.
If using shadows, be sure the shadows are pretty consistent.
If outside, don't have your subject facing the sun (effectively behind the photographer's back).
Use a reflector.
Be sure there is a light-colored flat surface near them.
Move the reflectors around.
Be sure that the main light is at an angle to your subject.

Use a microwave cautiously when liquefying honey.
Transfer your honey from any plastic containers into a glass jar by spoon.
Start microwaving honey in 30 second increments on the defrost setting.
Check for liquefaction of the honey after 30 seconds, particularly near the surface of the jar.
Microwave for additional increments of 15 to 30 seconds, stirring after each microwaving session.

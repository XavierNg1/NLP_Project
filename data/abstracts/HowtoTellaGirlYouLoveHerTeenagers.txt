Practice what you are going to say.
Find the right time and place.
Don’t assume that she loves you too.
Say, “I love you.” When the two of you are alone and the moment feels right, muster up the confidence to tell her, “I love you.” Look her in the eye, smile, and tell her, “I love you.” The timing doesn’t need to be perfect and the moment doesn’t have to be accompanied by a grand gesture, it just needs to be genuine.
Show her that you love her.
Write her a love note.
Be considerate of her response.
Consider if you try to impress her.
Determine if she is always on your mind.
Evaluate if she makes you want to be a better person.
Examine if you want to see her happy.
Be certain about your decision.

Leave the door open — literally and figuratively.
Don’t establish boundaries by laying down rules.
Get your priorities straight.
Many things can scare a free spirit out of a relationship.
Get to know the person inside-out.
Choose your battles wisely.
Give them the benefit of the doubt.
Get in touch with your own free spirit.
Love their free spirit.

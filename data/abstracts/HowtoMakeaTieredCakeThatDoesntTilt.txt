Start with the different sized cakes.
Dowel rods are essential for giving the cakes strength so you can stack them on top of one another.
Measure the cakes from bottom to top, then cut the dowels to the correct size.
Insert the dowels into each separate cake, placing them about halfway between the center of the cake and the edge.
Once all of the cakes are doweled, start with the largest cake.
Finished.

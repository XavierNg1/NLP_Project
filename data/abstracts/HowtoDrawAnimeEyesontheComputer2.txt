Set up your layers.
Sketch out your eyes on the first layer.
Go to layer 4, (the first, second and third will be saved for coloring) and trace over your sketch.
Use the eraser tool to erase the sketch on layer 1.
Use layer 2 to color in the skin surrounding the eye.
Color in the iris in layer 3.
You can choose to use the dodge tool to accent the eye, but don't overuse it.

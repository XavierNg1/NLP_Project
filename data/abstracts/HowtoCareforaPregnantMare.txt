Make sure that you have a large paddock for the mare to graze and exercise, in the coming months before birth.
Realize that the coming months are important for the growth of the foal.
Look into the correct vaccination schedule for pregnant mares.
Pay attention to safety and nutrition.
When the mare eats, only feed enough so that she'll eat it then walk away.
Exercise your mare.
When the mare is about a month to foaling, move her to a smaller yard where she can run around, but that is more sheltered and is fenced in to protect from wild dogs etc.
Recognize the signs of late-stage pregnancy.
You will probably miss the birth of the foal as they usually foal in the early hours of the morning between 12 and 5.
If you find that the mare has foaled, ensure that the placental membrane is entire - spread the membrane out on the ground, there should be one large tear where the foal emerged.
Ensure the foal is alive and walking.
Make sure the foal drinks and urinates.
At first you may want to keep the foal and mare in a small yard, but after about 3 days, move the foal to a bigger paddock and let the foal exercise.

Leg deformities are common in young foals and some are much helped by extending the confinement time.

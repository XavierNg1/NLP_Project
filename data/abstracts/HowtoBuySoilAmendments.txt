Determine what kind of soil amendment you need.
Bear in mind that each type of amendment will change the chemical composition of the soil -- lowering nitrogen or adding phosphorous, potassium or salt.
Calculate how much soil amendment you will need.
Buy soil amendments by the bag or truckload from garden centers, nurseries, compost facilities, landscapers and tree companies, farmers markets or online.

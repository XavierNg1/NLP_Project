Figure out what type of party you want.
Invite your friends, making sure you only invite as many people as you can manage.
Let people know what to expect in the invitation, often with a dress code.
Clean the house thoroughly before people arrive if you are not hiring a venue.
Make sure you have enough food for the entire party if you are serving food.
Have a variety of drinks on hand.
Give yourself 1-2 hours more to prepare than you think you need.

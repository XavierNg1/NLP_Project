Acquire a square instructional booklet, such as an unwanted booklet from a video game.
Skip over the first page.
Fold the second page's right-hand corner at the top down to the bottom.
Turn the page, and do the opposite.
Examine your folds so far.
Keep it in the position from the last step and fold the point B down over the first page until it collides with it and makes a triangle.
Fold the first base's corner (there is only one side free) down diagonally to the bottom.
Pull the two flaps back underneath your already folded triangles on top, and repeat the steps on those two flaps that you used to make the rest of the triangles.
Repeat on the other side.

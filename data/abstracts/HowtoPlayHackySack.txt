Wear shorts.
Practice the 3 basic kicks – inside (left and right), outside (left and right) and toe kick.

Combine kicks and stalls.
Keep your feet low; it may seem hard at first, but you skill will undoubtedly increase if you can kick low sacks.
Get used to ending up with a sack in weird places.
Stay relaxed while kicking.

Relax your hair every 8 to 16 weeks depending on your hair's needs.
Wash and condition your hair once or twice a week.
For those who need to wash more frequently than every once or twice a week, "CO-washing" (Conditioner Only washing) is an excellent alternative to the wash/condition.
It is best to avoid using heat to dry your hair, especially if the relaxed hair is somewhat damaged.
When using a curling iron to style your hair, do not allow the barrel cover to clamp down on your hair.
An ionic, ceramic curling iron or flat iron works well and is easy to find.
Never use petrolatum and mineral oil hair oil on relaxed hair as a moisturizer.
Use as little heat as possible with your hair as heat can only do more damage to relaxed hair.
Water based moisturizers are best for all hair types, although leave-in conditioners can double as moisturizer for the hair.
Deep condition the hair every week to maintain strength and moisture in the hair.Don't brush your hair with harsh bristles

Write your lyrics.
When structuring your lyrics, keep in mind that Rockabilly follows more often than not the "12 Bar Blues" song structure.
Once you have your lyrics on paper, start with creating chords for Rhythm guitar.
Establish a Bassline.
Establish a Drumbeat.
Create riffs for the Lead Guitar.
Throw it all together, play through it, and tweak as necessary.

Have fun!!

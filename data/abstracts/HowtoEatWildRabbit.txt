Rabbits, cottontails in particular, can be killed with an air rifle or small "toy" 50-lb crossbow.
If you merely wound the animal, kill it as quickly and painlessly as possible.
Cut off the lower half of each leg.
Peel back the skin at the neck.
Starting at the neck or just below the rib cage, cut through the belly as far as you can.
Remove the guts, keeping the liver and kidneys, if desired.
Chop the rabbit into pieces for easier cooking.

Pan-fry the meat.
At this point, if there's anything left, de-bone the rabbit and prepare it according to your favorite recipe.

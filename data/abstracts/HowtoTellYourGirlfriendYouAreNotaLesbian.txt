Gather up your knowledge of this girl you've become smitten with.
Find a secluded place where there won't be any onlookers.
Avoid holidays if you can.
Open with a hug, those are always nice, but if a kiss is what your girl wants, refuse subtly.
Be sincere and honest as you break the truth to her.
Show her empathy and compassion, without becoming overwhelmed by emotion.
Allow her to let out her feelings.
Give her a chance to talk it out with you.
Stay single for awhile.

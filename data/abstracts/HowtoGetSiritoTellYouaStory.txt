Turn on your iPhone and put on your volume if you would like.
Hold down the Home Button, which is located below the iPhone screen.
Once Siri is turned on, say the following words, "Tell me a story"Â or "Tell me a bedtime story" clear enough for Siri to understand.
Once Siri finally tells you, listen and enjoy!,
Try something new.
Share the word!

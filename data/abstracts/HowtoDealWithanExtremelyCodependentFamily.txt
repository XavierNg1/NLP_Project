Understand signs of codependency.
Explore books about codependency and its effects on the family and relationships.
The best way to move out of a codependent relationship is to stop focusing on the other and to focus on yourself and your health.
Eventually the other person will have to begin getting healthier as well or will have to rethink the importance of the relationship.
If the other person does not come to respect your needs and/or growth, however, the healthiest choice is to maintain your boundaries.

Reflect on what you honestly believe, and consider other faiths and world views.
Become a truth magnet.
If you cannot embrace another religion, keep the faith you have--attend church.
Forgive.
Look upward.
Communicate.
Realize that you are not alone (though it feels that way).
Retain active remembrance of identity.

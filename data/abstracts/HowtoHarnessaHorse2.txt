Harness a single horse from the front first.
To correctly fit the winkers (bridle), the horse’s eye should be in the centre of the winker blind, this should not be pressed close against the eye.
Consider use of the bits.
Use open bridles.
Place the breast collar sitting above the point of the horse’s shoulder, to allow freedom of movement, and below the windpipe, for your horse’s comfort.

,
Let the saddle sit behind the wither.
Carefully fit the crupper under the tail.
Reach the breeching seat around behind the horse from stifle to stifle.
Adjust as required.
Harnessing to the single carriage, reins held in the crook of your elbow, bring up the carriage.
Slide the shafts into the tugs.
Hold the reins as you walk around behind the carriage to get to the other side if you do not have a groom to assist you.
Check again.
To unharness reverse the order; loosen belly band, undo breeching straps and then traces off last.

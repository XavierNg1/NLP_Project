In a large pot, bring the water, chicken, celery, onion, salt and pepper, oregano, celery salt, and parsley to a boil.
Once your dish is done simmering, remove the chicken to cool and debone.
Start with 6 cups of your broth.
After that time is up, stir in another cup of broth.
Keep adding broth, stirring, and simmering for 5 minutes at a time until rice is done.

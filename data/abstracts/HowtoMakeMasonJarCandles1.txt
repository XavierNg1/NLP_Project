Secure the wick to the bottom of your jar.
Place two pencils over the mouth of the jar, to either side of the wick.
Fill a saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water, and place a candle-making pouring pot into it.
Add the wax into the pouring pot, and let it melt over medium heat.
Consider adding some color and/or fragrance.
Let the wax cool to about 130 to 140°F (55 to 60°C).
Fill the jar to the neck, or until you have 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of space left.Pour the wax into the jar slowly.
Let the wax set for 24 to 48 hours.The bigger your jar is, the longer it will take to set.
Trim the wick down to ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) before using the candle.This will help keep the wax from smoking as it burns and help the wick last longer.

Start every day with gratitude by completing these ten simple steps...
Meditate; that is, prepare your mind for miracles
The Universeâ€™s wish is that we be happy now.
Send love to people....just because you can.
Be gentle with yourself (this is known as 'self-compassion') and remember how far you've already come.
Surrender your plans and let Life take over.
Ditch, (or, if you prefer, discipline) the Ego.
Spend time outside and with Nature.
Keep an open mind; practice perceiving through all of your senses.
Breathe deeply & listen to your heartbeat.
Love is a choice and not a reaction.

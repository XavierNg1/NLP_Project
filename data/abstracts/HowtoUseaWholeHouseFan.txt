Determine the size of the fan your home will need.
Ensure that the home has at least 1.5 times the area for discharge as the opening you cut into the ceiling for the fan.
Determine where the best intake locations are (windows or doors).
Close the damper on the fireplace.
Open only the windows that have screens in the room(s) in which you are in.
Consider adding additional vents for the attic space.
Be safe.

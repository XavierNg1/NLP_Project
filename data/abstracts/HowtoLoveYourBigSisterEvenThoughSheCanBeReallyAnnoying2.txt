Now that you've had some deep thought about your relationship with her, first focus on the wounds that you need to heal.
If she responds badly to your apology, take it quietly.
Ask her if you had done anything in the past to offend or hurt her.
Show kindness towards her, and do pleasant things for her, such as letting her have the last bit of ice cream, or giving her the biggest cookie.
Immediately leave her alone if she tells you to go away.
If she tries to pick a fight with you, refuse to continue the fight.
Give her privacy.
Most importantly, tell her that you love her!

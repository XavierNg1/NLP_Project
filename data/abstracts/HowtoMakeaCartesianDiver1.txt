Grab a clean, empty 2 liter (0.5 US gal) soda bottle.
Fill the bottle completely to the top, so that it is almost overflowing.
Use an eyedropper for you diver, or create your own with household objects.
Place your diver in the bottle and seal the top tightly.
Gently squeeze the bottle to make the diver drop.
Troubleshoot the diver if it is not working.

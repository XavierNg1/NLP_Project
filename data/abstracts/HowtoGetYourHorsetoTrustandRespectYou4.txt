Do not touch your horse.
Attach a halter to your horse and secure a lead rope to the halter.
Stand about 3 feet in front of the horse and hold the lead rope in your right hand.
Raise up your right hand and point your index finger towards the horse.
Begin to gently wiggle the lead rope back and forth.
Practice this indirect pressure everyday.

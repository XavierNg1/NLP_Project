Get a deck of cards.
Secretly hold three cards in your hand.
Have the spectator pick a card.
Once again, pretend to be squaring up the deck.
Say you're taking the chosen card off the top of the deck.
Turn over the top three cards.
Tell your friend to not worry; you will do it again.
Finally, tell them you will do it once more.

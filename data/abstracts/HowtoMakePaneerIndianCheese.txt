Bring the milk to a temperature just below boiling.
Add lemon juice or citric acid, 5 ml (one teaspoon) at a time.
Allow the curds and whey to cool for half of an hour (or until still warm, but at a temperature you can handle).
Wrap the cheesecloth around itself in order to squeeze out moisture from the curds.
Shape the paneer, into a block and wrap it tightly with the cloth.
Soak the block of cheese in chilled water for 2-3 hours.
Use as directed in your recipe.

Go to Goodwill and buy two turtleneck sweaters in two different shades of gray; then, basically dissected them.
Then, cut a light grey sweater's abdomen section and sew that on to the abdomen of the darker sweater at a slight angle.

,
Cut the sleeve of the lighter gray sweater off, cut it into a short sleeve, and then sew that sleeve onto the darker grey sweater (on the side that you cut the sleeve off of).

,
Finally, take the widest, thickest black twine or thread you could find and sew the stitches onto the shirt where the three sections of the shirt's torso meet, then hem each section with that same thread.
Keep sewing until it looks like Stein's shirt.
Buy a pair of white shoes, and draw stitches all over them with a black sharpie.
Wear a pair of clear, no-frame/plastic-frame glasses, and draw black stitches in a huge semicircle around your right eye.
Construct a headband with Stein's head screw; if you can, make the screw head spin and click by integrating metallic parts.

,
If you feel so inclined, you can decorate an office chair to look like Stein's, as well as design a death scythe out of old wrapping paper tubes.
To get Stein's voice right it's best to watch the show multiple times through.
Adopt Stein's mind-frame.

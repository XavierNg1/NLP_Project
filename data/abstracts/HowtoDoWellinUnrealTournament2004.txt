Wall jumps, dodges and dodge jumps make you move faster, thus being harder to hit.

In onslaught, when the enemy's core is ready to attack, get near it as fast as possible with a manta or even better a raptor.
In onslaught, first attack any raptors that are flying around attacking your nodes with AVRILS, secondary mini-gun fire, turrets or shock rifles because they can be very annoying.

,
Its always essential you have the right weapons in the right situations so you can grab a weapon supply at one node then quickly transfer to another node and get those weapons back.

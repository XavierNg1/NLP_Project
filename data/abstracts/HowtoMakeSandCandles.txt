Choose a flat-bottomed object with smooth sides to make your mold.
Fill a large container with damp sand.
Press the object bottom-first into the sand.
Pull object out very carefully, so that the sand keeps the shape of your object.
Consider pressing some objects into the walls of your mold.Choose some glass gems, sea glass, or small shells, and press them party-way into the walls of your mold.
Press a tabbed wick into bottom of your mold.
Place two sticks across the opening of your mold, one to either side of the wick.
Set up a double boiler.
Add the candle wax into the melting pot and heat it between 260°F and 275°F (126°C and 135°C).
Pour the melted wax slowly into the sand form, all the way to the top.
Wait for your first pour of wax to set.
Heat more wax for your second pour, this time between 175°F and 190°F (80°C and 88°C).Use a higher temperature if you want a thicker shell, and a lower temperature if you want a thinner shell.

,
Consider adding some color or fragrance.
Pour the wax slowly into the mold, all the way to the top.
Let the candle sit overnight.The wax may set up sooner than that, but you will need to wait for the sand to dry as well.
Remove the candle from the sand carefully the next day.
Gently brush the excess sand off using a soft-bristled brush.
Consider carving designs into the sand to expose the candle underneath.
Trim the wicks to about ¼ inch (0.63 centimeters), if necessary.Depending on how long or short your wick is, you may need to trim it down.
Flatten the bottom of the candle, if necessary.
Use your candle.

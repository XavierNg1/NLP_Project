Make a drying tray with a plastic screen or using cheesecloth stretched tightly on a frame.
Harvest the fruit just before it becomes over-ripe.
Allow the fruit to cool if it is warm from growing in the sun.

,
Wash, pit, dry, peel (if necessary) and thinly slice the fruit.
Prevent oxidation, or darkening of the fruit, after slicing.
Arrange the fruit on the drying tray with spaces between, so that the pieces donâ€™t touch.

,
Place a piece of glass above the food to intensify the sun on the fruit, but make sure there is enough space above the fruit for good air circulation.

,
Set the tray in the sun for approximately 2-4 days.
Equalize the fruit after drying to allow moisture from some pieces to transfer to the dryer pieces.
Store the dried fruit in a container with a tight-fitting lid or in a zipper-seal bag.

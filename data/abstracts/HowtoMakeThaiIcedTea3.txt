Bring the water to a boil.
Take the saucepan off the burner, add the tea, then let it steep, covered, for 5 minutes.
Pour the tea through a fine, mesh sieve into a large pitcher, then stir in the maple syrup, sugar, and vanilla extract.
Let the tea chill for 2 to 3 hours in the fridge before pouring it over ice.
Top the tea with some coconut milk, then serve it.

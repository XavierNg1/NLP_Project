Find a Minecraft server that you really like.
Introduce yourself on the server.
Make a good example of yourself.
Ask the owner or existing moderators if the server could use some more.
If no moderators/Ops are needed, keep playing anyway.
Ask to become one politely.
If the previous step does not work, don't worry.
Remember to always be polite and understanding.

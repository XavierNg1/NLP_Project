Place your bass drum on the floor with the head on top.
Figure out where you want your hole.
Decide what size you would like.
Take off the label on the can and place the top edge of the empty can down on an electric stove to heat it up.
Once your can is hot enough, about 20-30 seconds on high on the electric stove, grab the can with the mitts and slowly place the hot edge on the bass drum head.
Slowly pull out the can trying not to bump the side of the head as the can may be very hot.

Have the right equipment.
Know the basic telemark turn.
Keep your hands in front of you and close together.
Have your upper body always face downhill.
"Gimme the ball!",
Put as much weight as possible on your rear ski (the trailing ski as you're carving a turn).
Focus on "stepping back" with your trailing ski into a turn, instead of consciously "stepping forward" with your leading ski.
Try to feel as if you're pinching a pencil between your ribcage and your hip as you're making your turn.
Another good exercise to promote better carving is "big toe, little toe": try to think about pushing down on the big toe of your leading ski and the little toe of the trailing ski as you carve a turn.

,
Try exaggerating your knee bends.
Keep your rear (trailing) ski under control.
Work on your pole placement.

Decide between white and regular whole wheat.
Opt for whole wheat pastry flour for lighter bakes.
Start with spelt when branching out from wheat.
Add barley for creamy textures.
Use oat to support chocolate, fruits, and nuts.
Avoid “multigrain.” If you’re looking to eliminate baking with white flour entirely, read the package of any flour labeled as multigrain.

Formulate an idea.
This combination of genres may seem confusing when you look at it face on, but remember that teenagers are very easily bored.
Once you have a genre, think of where you're going to go with it.
Try to draw on real life situations, but just exaggerate them a bit to increase their interest.
You must find whatever you're writing interesting.
Use language they'd understand.
Try to add a little reality into everything.
Always remember who your target audience are, and where you are heading with your novel.

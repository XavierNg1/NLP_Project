Bake the two sheet cakes of your choice.
Cut four 12" x 12" (30.5cm x 30.5cm) squares from the sheet cakes.
Using the remaining cake from the sheet cakes, cut three squares (the size of these will depend on how much sheet cake you have left over).
Once you have the base and middle section shapes correct size-wise, you can dismantle the base and middle section to start crumb coating each section.
Since the real Eiffel Tower is gray, use gray fondant with gray butter cream icing for the majority of the cake.
Use a darker gray for the border and roll a brick pattern over it before cutting it into strips and applying them to the edges of the arch.
Cover the middle section with the gray and red fondant as you did with the base section.
Start the piping, this is where any bumps or blunders will be hidden.
Continue to pipe the middle section and then stack it on top of the base section as displayed below.
For the top portion use Styrofoam covered with gray fondant.
Create a cylinder covered in fondant with a small tower at the top and attach it to the top section of the cake.

Get about ten sheets of copy (computer) paper, a spiral notebook large enough for the class you are attending, and a three-ringed binder, either large enough for the class you are attending, or to contain notes for several classes, which ever is best for you.
Fold and cut the copy paper sheets in half, making them 8.5" x 5.5".
Use these sheets to take notes on in class.
Turn the pages over, or go to another sheet, as necessary, progressively numbering each page in the top right hand corner.
Remember that as soon you get home from class, if any reading is required to correspond with the day's lessons, it would be worth while to take notes, again on your note paper.

Know that as soon as possible, preferably that evening, but before a test is scheduled, rewrite the information you took in class, and any associated reading notes, into a spiral notebook.
When a test is scheduled for that class, a day or two before the test, rewrite the information from the spiral notebook into the three ringed binder.
Get to bed at a reasonable hour the night before your test, and get a full night's sleep.
Understand that what this method works, is your persistence in following the above noted steps.

Think about why you want to wait.
Determine your boundaries in advance.
Stay away from lurid media depictions of sex and fantasy.
Let your close friends know your decision to be abstinent.
State your boundaries clearly and quickly in romantic situations.
Remain firm in your beliefs, even if it means leaving events or parties.
Remember that abstinence is the only 100% effective way to prevent pregnancy and STDs.

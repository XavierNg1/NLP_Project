Get out your calender.
Prepare in advance.
Before you start your day, plan where this is going to take place.
You may light some candles in the bathtub, but if there is a small window, open it a tiny bit so that there is some fresh air.
Now lay the fluffy towel where it's easy to reach so you won't be cold, and your fresh comfy cloths (along with your hair tie so you can tie your hair into a high ponytail to get it out of your face) as well unless you have a robe you want to wear.
Next, go buy some snacks and rent out a chick flick movie.
If you want, you can turn off your cell phone or page so that you won't be bothered.

,
Now go and RELAX!

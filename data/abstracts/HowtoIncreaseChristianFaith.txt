Feed your faith: receive a measure of faith from God, through receiving the Word of God -- by studying the Bible.
Check the Bible where it says Jesus Christ had the faith of God without measure.
Be born again as a believer by repentance (turning around) and continuing in Christ, so that you will receive within you a measure of faith and the Spirit of God.
Love your brother.
Having faith to move problems as mountains is simply trusting God to keep His Word.
Fellowship with Him and as this develops you will come to agree with those who trust God.
Cultivate your faith by giving Him the opportunity to reveal Himself to you.
Act on your faith.
Think on the Word of God.
Build your faith by saying one thing and thinking that same thing and acting it out honestly, not by just pretending.
Edify yourself through faith which is also developed through praying in the language of the spirit (Jude 20).
Spend time each day, praying and meditating in the Word in your native language and also in other tongues, and you can keep your spirit active instead of being passive.
Let God inhabit your meditations and praises and grow in your being.
Refuse to accept doubt.
Investigate why God inhabits the praises of His people: It was an honor to God, that the tabernacle tent made way for the temple of stone, but now He is within you.So, the tabernacle makes way for the faithful spirit as God's favored dwelling:
But the universe is God's temple; so, what reason then is there for a temple in the human spirit?,
Follow Jesus by faith into the active nature of Christ in the chosen and anointed life, way and the truth: so the redeemed, contrite, faithful human spirit may represent his favored temple that He wants to inhabit.

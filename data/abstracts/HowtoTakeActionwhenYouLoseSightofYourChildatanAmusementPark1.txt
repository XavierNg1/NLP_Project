Before you go, explain to your children what they should do if they get separated at any time from you or their guardians.
Provide memory aids.
Use your camera or cell phone and take a picture of your children when you arrive at the park.
Make sure everyone in your group, including parents and older siblings, are wearing the same bright, recognizable clothing.
Bring along a way to communicate with your kids.
Find a place to designate as your 'meeting spot' if someone from the group is separated, once you arrive at the amusement park.
Remember to stay together at all times.

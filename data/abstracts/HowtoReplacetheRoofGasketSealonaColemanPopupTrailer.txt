Put your trailer roof/top up 6–12 inches (15.2–30.5 cm) so you can work on it.
Scrape off the old glue residue from the roof edge with a putty knife or razor blade.
You will need about 41 feet (12.5 m) of new seal for the largest of the Coleman Popup Trailers.
Starting from the center back of the trailer press the new seal onto the roof edge.
Let dry for 24 hours, lower your roof, and you are done!

Realize foremost that, as human beings, we all tend to make mistakes in life, both big and small.
Be aware that most people who make mistakes feel some sense of remorse or conscience twinge about what they've done.
Seek to understand why the person behaved the way that they did.
Forgive those people who hurt you.
Keep in mind that life is too short to hold on to bad memories and thoughts that create pain.

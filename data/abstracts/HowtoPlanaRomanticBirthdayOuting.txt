Make sure the upcoming birthday is free of any obligations, work related, or family oriented, and if so, then just pick another day that the two of you can enjoy hassle free together.
Start doing some investigating, especially if this is a fairly new relationship!,
Plan your perfect birthday outing.
Think about what he wants rather than what he needs.
Tease your partner, not in a mean way, but you want to make him anticipate what you've got up your sleeve.
Choose what to wear.
Celebrate!,
Give him the ultimate gift, and that's you!

Prepare a home.
Make the habitat as much like the toad's natural area as possible, which includes dirt and sand, grass, water, small logs and rocks.
Add water.
Be sure the lid closes securely.
Be sure that the habitat does not get below 60˚F or above 70˚F. ,
Feed your toad properly.
Feed toads live food as they only eat things that move.
Alternatively, catch insects outside.
Perform regular maintenance.
If your toad appears to be lethargic or especially thin, look up "Toad Illnesses" on Google and refine your search by adding "thin" or whatever describes the current illness.
If you plan on handling your toad, wash your hands thoroughly with water and mild soap and rinse especially well.
Find a 5 gallon (18.9 L) container with a lid.
Fill a bottle cap with water.
Place the toad inside and cover the habitat.

Use Google Trends to compare the search volume for the topic with the search volume for other topics.Because of its design, Google Trends only gives relative numbers and cannot give absolute search volume, so it is best used to compare different pages in the same reference class.
Use keyword research tools to get more in-depth data on search volume and comparison with similar terms.

Consider what you want your Pokémon sprite to look like.
Open a Pokémon image generator program or website.
Capture the Pokémon images you want to borrow from to make your sprite.
Copy the Pokémon images to your graphic editor program.
Decide which Pokémon image will form the body of your sprite and which image(s) you will take parts from to add to the body.

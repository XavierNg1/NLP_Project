Start by retrieving sources that can be retrieved online.
Start searching within libraries for the rest of the sources.
Compile a list containing the sources you could not acquire using the first steps.
Compile a list of the citations of any sources you couldn't obtain thus far.
Use WorldCat to see if you can obtain your remaining sources from a different library nearby, or just request it through Interlibrary Loan.

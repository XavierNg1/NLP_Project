Know that outdoor grilling lends a rich, smoky flavor to your steak.
Pre-heat your grill to medium-high.
Rub the steak with salt and pepper while the grill heats.
Place your steak over direct heat on the grill.
Cook each side of the steak over direct heat for 7-10 minutes, depending on desired doneness.
Remove the steak from direct heat and let it cook indirectly until desired doneness.
Let the steak stand for 10 minutes after removing from the grill.

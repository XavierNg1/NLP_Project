Barbie is blemish-free and always looking squeaky clean!,
Apply a strong, nicely scented deodorant.
Shave your legs and arms every other day to avoid stubble!,
If you already have good nails, have them done every week.
Cleanse, exfoliate, tone, apply bag and puffiness removal creams, and moisturize in the morning.
If acne won't go away, try Proactiv or other acne solutions.
Brush your teeth two to three times a day and use mouth wash to ensure fresh breath.
Use perfume (but don't drown yourself in it) so you always smell good!,
Carry around lip balm all day, so your lips are never dry and chapped!

,
Whatever you do, don't use neon eyeshadow or eyeliner and/or purple, black, or hot pink lipstick!,
During the day, try for a one-colored, light eye, such as pale pink, light blue, or white, a nude pink for lips, and some natural looking blusher.
Have fun!

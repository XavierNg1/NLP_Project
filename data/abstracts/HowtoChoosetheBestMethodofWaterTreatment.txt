Find out the source of your home's water.
Is your well water treated (chlorinated) or untreated?,
Chlorine is also inexpensive to administer and maintain; it keeps the entire water system cleaner and freer of algae, bacteria and other pipe and holding tank contaminants.
Is there dirt, turbidity, or other organic matter in your well or spring water?,
Reverse osmosis and distillation, by themselves, do not remove bacteria, viruses, and some chemicals; all reputable RO and distiller units are always coupled with good carbon filtration, preferably carbon block, to ensure removal of these contaminants.

Recognize that some believe that distillation is the only method in which water can be purified.
However, the problem is that distillation, by itself, does not remove all chemical pollution.
The other problem with distilled water itself is that the water is lacking an ion, and it aggressively attaches to calcium and other minerals in the body, and flushes them out.
Take all of the above factors into consideration when researching and purchasing a water treatment system.
Testing is the only way to determine if your water is suitable for drinking and other uses.
Understand that testing is only telling you what was in your water at the moment the water sample was taken.

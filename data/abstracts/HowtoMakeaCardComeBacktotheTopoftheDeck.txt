Tell the participant you are going to use mind control to make a card magically rise to the top of a deck.
Perform a double lift.
Turn the cards over and ask the participant to memorize the card you are showing them â€” which they think is the top card.
Put the cards back.
Say the magic words, snap or ask the participant to tap on the deck and visualize the card rising toward them.

,
Now flip over the top card, and enjoy their amazement that the card you supposedly shoved in the middle is suddenly back on top!

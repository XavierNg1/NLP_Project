Keep fingers and hands out of a blender.
Take care to keep dangling clothing or jewelry out of the way when blending.
Do not put anything in the blender while it is in use.
Use the blender only for a short blending time.This is especially important if your blender does not have a cut-off switch if the engine overloads (cheaper and older models may lack such an automatic cut-off).
Remove the blender jar or jug from the blender base before taking the lid off any blended food.This ensures that you can't accidentally bump the blender into working mode, which could cause an accident.

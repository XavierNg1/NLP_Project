Start shopping around and get clothes that are either unisex or follow the new trends.
Try cutting (or having a hairdresser cut) your hair in a pixie cut, either slicked back or natural.
Eyebrow size and shape is another characteristic that is strongly associated with gender.
If you particularly care for makeup, line your eyes in grey or black eyeliner but nothing too flashy or obvious.
As for the shoes, converse and oxfords (high heels for girls) work.
Be independent.
Avoid wearing soft and powdery colors like they're the plague.
Compress your breasts if you have them.
Hide your legs, unless you don't shave them.
Don't worry about others' opinions; what other people think of you is not anything to be extremely concerned about.

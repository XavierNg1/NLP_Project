Place the cooked breasts in your baking dish and cover gently with sauce.
Coat liberally with mozzarella cheese.
Cook, uncovered, until the cheese is brown and bubbly.
While the chicken finishes, cook and drain 1 lb of spaghetti, drizzling with a little butter and olive oil when done.
Serve the chicken on top of a bed of pasta with a spoonful of fresh sauce.

Understand Customer Requirements.
Analyse Buying Patterns.
Utilize your product knowledge and bundle the principal product with ‘relevant’ products.
Time your cross-sell pitch in a way that the customer feels a sense of urgency.
Offer a customer the top reviews and testimonials by existing users of the product, if he is about to buy from you.
Always offer three different pricing options with the middle one being your primary goal (for example, Option A - $750, Option B - $1000 and Option C - $1250).
Train your sales personnel specifically on cross selling.

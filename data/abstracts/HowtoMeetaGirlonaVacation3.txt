Keep the conversation light-hearted.Even if you're looking to make a serious romance with the girl you're talking with, you shouldn't touch upon any serious topics when you're first chatting with her.
Invite her to do something with you.You shouldn't wait long into a conversation before asking the girl to do something fun with you.
Take advantage of a vacation's excitement.Unlike a romance closer to home, there's a much greater degree of excitement when you're out on vacation.
Share good experiences together.A vacation is meant to be a time where you get out and do things you're not familiar with.
Look for signs of attraction.As with any interaction with a woman you're interested in, you can gauge the likelihood of your success by looking at signs of attraction.
Act quickly.Vacations don't last long, so your window of opportunity will almost always be accordingly brief.
Practice safety first.Vacationers who meet other singles are more likely to practice unsafe sexual practices than if they were back at home.

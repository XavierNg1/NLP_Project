Choose a well-made cigar you want to smoke.
Use an odorless flame to light the cigar.
Light your match or a butane lighter.
Toast the cigar.You will put the lit flame once inch from the foot of the cigar (the end you do not inhale from).
Place the cigar in your mouth when it begins to smolder.
Take short puffs from the unlighted end while holding the cigar close to the flame.
Rotate the slow-burning part down.Cigars will often get "runs," or areas that are burning faster than others.
Apply moisture to the wrapper to slow the burn down.
Burn off the uneven section.
Use small, shallow puffs to enjoy the cigar smoke.
Let any ash build up until it is ready to fall.
Relight the cigar as needed.
Lay the cigar down in an ashtray when you are done.After smoking a cigar two-thirds of the way down, it is done.To put out a cigar, simply leave it on an ashtray until it naturally goes out.

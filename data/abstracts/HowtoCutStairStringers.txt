Measure twice for your total rise and run and your individual rise and run.
Place a framing square near the end of a 2 x 12 (38 x 286 mm) board.
Use the rise and run figures marked on the outside scales of the square that matches your measurements.
Mark the outline of the square's outer edges.
Make another mark to the right of the run line that is parallel and equal to the thickness of the thread.
Slide the framing square along the board to the right so your scale run figure touches the end of your first marked run line.
Cut notches into the stringer with a circular saw.
Trim an amount equal to the thread thickness from the bottom of your stringer.

Prepare the steak before you cook it.
Know what to avoid.
Slow cook thick steaks first.
Prepare a pan to sear the steak.
While your pan is getting scorching hot, paintÂ some olive oil or rendered fat (healthiest options), vegetable oil or butter onto both sides of the steak.
Lay the steak in the pan.
Serve and eat.

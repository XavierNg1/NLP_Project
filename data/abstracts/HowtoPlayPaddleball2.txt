Purchase a paddleball set containing a ball, two or four paddles, and a net.
Get started by choosing a location on a beach or any other sandy location such as a playground or a beach volleyball court.
Draw a rectangle in the sand with your heel or anything you have handy that measures 15 feet (4.6 m) by 48 feet (14.6 m) for a singles court or 26-1/4 feet by 52-1/2 feet for a doubles court.
Put up your net across the center of the width of your court.
Pick your teams.
Learn to score.
Establish which team will serve first by either flipping a coin or holding a volley war.
Learn that only one serve is allowed per point, and only one hit is allowed to get the ball over the net.
Remember that "lets," balls that skim the net before going over the net, are in play just like any other hit.

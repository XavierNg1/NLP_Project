Pick out 4-5 large oranges -- preferably Seville.
Cut the orange and into thin, round slices.
Stack the slices and cut in half, making little half-moon shaped pieces.
Peel and grate the rinds ahead of time, optionally adding to the sliced fruit.
Add the fruit pieces and juices to your pot and cover with the water.
Zest the lemon into the pot and then squeeze out all of the juice, adding as well.
Bring the water to a boil, stirring frequently.
Lower the heat to a rapid simmer and cook for 40 minutes once the water boils.
Return the mixture to a boil and add the sugar, after 40 minutes, r stirring continually.
Boil, stirring frequently, for 15-20 minutes, or until set.
Test the marmalade before canning it.

In order to be a good student, one of the key areas you'll have to work on is being organized.
Buy a binder to store your notes, homework, and tests/quizzes in it.
Buy a pencil case and put all your writing utensils in there.
Buy a planner or an agenda to make note of the due dates of assignments, tests, and big projects.
Make sure your locker is clean and organized.

Take a look at the diagram at hand.
Understand the objective.
Apply Pythagorean Theorem to triangle ABD to get:
AB2 = AD2 + BD2 ...(1)

,
We already know that:
BD = BC + CD
Squaring both sides,
BD2 = (BC + CD)2
=> BD2 = BC2 + CD2 + 2.BC.CD ...(2)

,
Substitute BD2 from (2) into (1) to get:
AB2 = AD2 + BC2 + CD2 + 2.BC.CD ...(3)

,
Apply Pythagorean Theorem in triangle ACD to get:
AC2 = AD2 + CD2 ...(4)

,
Substitute AD2 + CD2 = AC2, from (4) into (3) to get:
AB2 = BC2 + AC2 + 2.BC.CD.

Try to be sympathetic towards the patient.
Listen attentively to what they tell you.
Give them as much of your time as you can.
Try to take their mind off their problems.
BE PATIENT with them.
Remember they are depressed, so do not expect any happy-go-lucky behavior from them right away.
It's all about your attention, love and patience.

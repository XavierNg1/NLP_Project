Find an immobile subject to photograph.
Get a piece of steel 20 cm long x 2.5 cm wide (8 x 1 inches).
Go to your tripod and remove the screw that holds the camera to the platform.
Push a 5mm galvanized steel roof bolt through the hole in the tripod platform, from which you removed the camera securing screw and through the hole in the un-drilled end of the steel slat, ensuring that the thread of the camera securing screw is uppermost.
Screw your camera onto the other end of the slat.
Focus on an object not closer than 20 metres (60 feet) away and take a picture.
Keep a record of all your shots and indicate which was taken from the left-hand position and which from the right.

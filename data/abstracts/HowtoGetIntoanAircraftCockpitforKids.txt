As you pass the cockpit, peek in!,
If they don't notice, keep trying to look in but don't stay in the front foyer long.
As you board, step into the galley and address the lead flight attendant who is generally the one closest to the door.
At this point the flight attendant will either usher you into the flight deck or knock on the door and ask the pilots if they have time for a visit.
When you step into the flight deck, look to see if the pilots are busy with a checklist or a briefing.
If time is short you can always wait until the flight is over and then come up to visit.

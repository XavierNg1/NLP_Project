Select some Start Year by any method you have available, trying to make it no more than 5 years BEFORE the Target Year that you are looking for.
Look up the value for Day of the Week that you have for the Target Year in the above table.
Compute the number of years from the Start Year to the next Leap Year.
To find the first occurrence of your Target Year after the Start Year, add the DOW Gap (from step 2) to the Start Year that you chose for step 1.
In the event that you overshot or undershot the Start Year and, thus, missed the actual Target Year, you can make adjustments quickly by computing the prior or next yearly occurrences of the Target Date as follows: Compute the Leap Gap from the Target Year to the next Leap Year exactly as you did in step 3, above.

Draw an outline of a doll on a sheet of paper with a sharp pencil and cut it out.
Use the pattern to cut out 2 dolls from your fabric.
Pin the right sides of the 2 doll fabric pieces together with sewing pins.
Sew the 2 doll fabric pieces together, using a thread that matches the fabric.
Reach inside the open side of the fabric dolls and stuff the doll with your fabric stuffing.. Like the shape and colour, the stuffing can also make your stress doll better to use - if you're a kicker or a puncher, soft, squashy material will work for you - a squeezer might prefer uncooked rice so the doll feels grainy.
Stitch the opening closed.

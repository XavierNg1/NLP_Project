Gather plenty of newspaper or a very large plastic bag to lay the pheasant on.
Know the two types of feathers you will encounter and how to deal with them.
Hold the skin in place with your supporting hand whenever pulling out feathers.
Start by removing the long, thick tail feathers one at a time.
Work on the wings next, pulling 1-2 feathers at a time.
Pull off the back feathers slowly by working against the grain.
Using the same strategy as used on the back feathers, move on to the breast.
Remove the thick feathers around the neck, and under the wing one at a time.
Carefully remove the last bits of feather around the feet, neck, and tail.
Optionally, hang pheasants for 3-4 days before plucking to make processing easier.

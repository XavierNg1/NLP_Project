Keep rules to yourself.
Confuse “points” and “strokes.” According to strict rules, when you fill out your scorecard after each hole, you add a point for each stroke you took.
Force them to play longer drives.
Let your opponent play balls from the edge.
Make them play “dirty.” Technically, you are allowed to clean your ball and/or the course at any time once the ball is in play, as long as it isn’t actually moving.Unless you need to do a little cleaning to improve your own game, don’t share this with your opponent.

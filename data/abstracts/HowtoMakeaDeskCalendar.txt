Cut a sheet of paper (8.5 by 11 inches) in half across its width.
Use a pencil and a ruler to draw two vertical lines.
Draw lines to divide the box into 5 rows, each 1 inch tall.
Draw a 1/4-by-1/4-inch square in the top left corner of each square on the calendar.
Draw a line spanning the length of the three center-most columns, a quarter-inch from the top of the paper.
Make 12 copies of the calendar template on card stock using a copying machine or a computer scanner.
Punch two holes in the left side of each copy, centered in the open space outside the squares and 1.5 inches from the top and bottom edges of the page respectively.
Start with January and label the top of each calendar page with the appropriate month.
Consult a calculator to find out on what day of the week January 1 falls in the year for which you're making the calendar.
Label dates with their respective holidays.
Set the calendar in a small easel.

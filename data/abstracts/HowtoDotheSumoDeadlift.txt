Do the sumo deadlift with a medium wide stance.
Do a partial, medium stance, sumo deadlift by stopping the lift at the kneecap.
To have a complete deadlift motion and benefit from it:


Do the conventional deadlift from above the kneecaps.
Do singles, doubles or possibly triples instead of a continuous repetition set with the medium stance deadlift to the knees.
In between your singles or doubles, think about technique pointers:


Track your knees over your feet.
Use footwear with lateral support such as cross trainers.
Have in place a total body routine.
Practice without weights, quick side to side moving from the deep crouch, like a crab, to top of your routine.

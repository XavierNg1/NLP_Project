Get a soft, clean cloth.The cloth should be free of lint and made from cotton or ultra-fine microfiber (like an eyeglass cloth).Avoid using anything abrasive, like paper towels or toilet paper.
Lift the disc and hold it by its edge.
Flip your PlayStation game over so that the shiny side faces you, and hold it steady.

,
Blow a short (but strong) puff of air at the surface to free loose dust.
Use the cloth to gently wipe the shiny side, using straight strokes from the center out.Avoid wiping back-and-forth or in circular strokes, as they can scratch the surface!,
Dampen a corner of the cloth to wipe more the difficult areas.If there are tough-to-remove spots remaining, wet a corner of the cloth with cold water and rub the area again.
Get some non-abrasive toothpaste that isn’t a gel.If you see some light scratches on the shiny side of your game, they can be buffed out with toothpaste.
Hold the PlayStation game disc under cold water to get the shiny side wet.
Apply (roughly) a dime-sized amount of toothpaste to your cloth.
Gently rub toothpaste over the scratched area in straight strokes, starting from the center.
Run the disc under lukewarm water until all toothpaste is removed from the game.
Shake the remaining water from the game and leave it to dry, face up, at room temperature.Now that the game has been cleaned and buffed, it’s time to let it dry.

Sound hoarse.
Make your voice crack and fade.
Throw in some strained whispering when you speak.
Cough when you talk.
Complain about symptoms in the days leading up to your voice loss.
Talk less than you normally would.
Write things down to communicate.
Drink a lot of water.
Suck on throat lozenges.

Find a suitable container to keep your sewing kit in.
Gather together the following items for inclusion in the sewing kit:
Needles - purchase a set of needles in differing sizes






Pins - get a container of dressmaking pins






Scissors - keep one pair of quality sewing scissors in reserve just for needlework and sewing projects; don't use it for any other cutting






Cotton thread - select the base colours white, black, navy blue and beige as a minimum; these are the most commonly used colours for sewing.
Place all items in the container.

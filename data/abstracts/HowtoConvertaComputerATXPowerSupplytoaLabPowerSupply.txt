Look online or at your local computer store for an ATX computer power supply, or dismantle an old computer and remove the power supply from the case.
Unplug the power cable from the power supply and turn off the switch on the back (if there is one).
Remove the screws that attach the power supply to the computer case and remove the power supply.

,
Cut off the connectors (leave a few inches of wire on the connectors so that you can use them later on for other projects).

,
Discharge the power supply by letting it sit unconnected for a few days.

Gather the parts you need: binding posts (terminals), a LED with a current-limiting resistor, a switch (optional), a power resistor (10 ohm, 10W or greater wattage, see Tips), and heat shrink tubing.

,
Open up the power supply unit by removing the screws connecting the top and the bottom of the PSU case.

,
Bundle wires of the same colors together.

Drill holes in a free area of the power supply case by marking the center of the holes with a nail and a tap from the hammer.

Screw the binding posts into their corresponding holes and attach the nut on the back.

,
Connect all the pieces together.

Check for loose connections by gently tugging on them.

Plug the power cable into the back of the power supply and into an AC socket.

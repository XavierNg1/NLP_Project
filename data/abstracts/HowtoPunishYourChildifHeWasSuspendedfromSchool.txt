Don't overreact when the school contacts you to inform you about the suspension.
If you don't get all the information you want at the first contact, don't be afraid to call back for further details.
Don't be quick to blame the school.
Evaluate the fairness of the suspension with questions such as:


Does the consequence fit the crime?,
Set up a suspension kit.
Keep your child(ren) focused during the suspension days.
Confiscate privileges such as TV, video games, and computer (unless your child needs to do research and/or projects or anything educational online for school) during the suspension days.
Use alternative punishments.
Don't expect your child to talk about it right away.
Explain to your child what they have done was wrong and why it's wrong.

First you should see if you qualify to become one.
If you qualify, you then have to take a Fire Safety Director course by a FDNY accredited school and pass their exam.
After completing and passing the school you then can take the FDNY written test (which you get two chances to pass) with a minimum score of 70%.
After passing your written test, take and pass an on-site which is a test administered by the FDNY at the location where you are to become a fire safety director.

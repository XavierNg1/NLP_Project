Find out the reason for the shaking during the spin cycle.
Try to tip or tilt the machine.
Re-level your machine and ensure it is supported correctly.
Use a pair of pliers if the thumbscrews are too tight to turn with your fingers, and spraying the screws with a lubricant may help, also.

,
Restart your machine when you have made sure all the leveling screws are in contact with the floor.

,
Use shims to support the machine if the screws have become unusable for some reason (broken, stripped, or otherwise damaged).
Cut a number of shims, about 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2Â cm) in width, and stack them under each corner where they are needed, until the corners are equally supported.

,
Restart the machine and observe your results.

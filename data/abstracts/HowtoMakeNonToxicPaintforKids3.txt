Add glow powder or paint.Because you're making the paint yourself, you can add whatever you'd like.
Use old candies for food colouring.If candies are old and stale, they can still be used as a food colouring agent in your paint.
Make a natural watercolour paint with fresh flowers.Fresh, brightly coloured flowers will colour water if they're submerged.

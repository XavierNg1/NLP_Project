Make sure that the decoration and design is the right kind to suit your taste, before you agree to give an order to the baker.
Decide on how you want to decorate your wedding cake, whether you want to keep it simple and cute or splendid and rich.
Consider borrowing the pillars.
Find prices at a cake making or culinary school near your place.
Save on your wedding cake topper prices.
If you buy a multi-tiered cake, see that you decorate it yourself or have the florist do it for you.
Consider a smaller tiered cake for effect, and get a sheet cake to feed the guests.
If your venue charges a cutting fee for cakes brought in from outside sources, consider a cupcake tower.
Find out your bakers fee structure before you book.
Find out what portion size the baker is using.
A design that is easy for that particular baker is going to cost you less than a design that is more difficult for that baker.
Bakers are more eager to give you the little "something extra" if you are easy to work with and pay on time with their payment schedule.
If you can't afford your original cake design after booking work with your baker to design a new one that does fit your budget better.
Order your cake early as you may be able to lock in the cost of the cake with some bakers before price increases take effect for a given year.

Check for correct paper size and type in your printer manual and make sure you haven't overfilled your paper feeder to avoid paper jams and may even stop a smudgy or uneven print problem.
Update or re-install your driver may fix printing errors such as strange characters and unreadable text.
Clean your printer heads to avoid blurry text and images.
Replace your cartridges or toner to fix "low ink level" alerts, and missing/non-existent text or pictures.
Having exhausted all of these options, it may be time to: call in a repair person if it's a high end printer; contact the printer manufacturer if the printer is still under warranty; or consider replacing the old printer with a new one.

Pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees and gather your ingredients.
Get your baking sheet, pan, or mold and line it with parchment paper.
Gather your peppermint candies, unwrap them,Â and place them in a pattern in your mold or on your baking sheet.
After finishing your pattern of candies, carefully place the pan into the oven without shifting the candies.
Leave the candies in the oven for around 7-8 minutes.
Once the candies have melted together, take the pan out of the oven and allow it to cool completely before removing the platter from the pan and the parchment paper or foil.Now that your platter or plate is done, put some cookies, a cake, or decorations on it, sit back, and enjoy!

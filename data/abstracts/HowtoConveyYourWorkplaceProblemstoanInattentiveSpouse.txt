Do not start off by shouting loud and complaining about all the situations that happened during the day.
Indulge in things that would cool you off and would let your emotions settle.

,
Keep a bag of goodies handy.
Meanwhile, just try thinking in an unbiased manner where you have faltered at your work place to have deserved those insults or back fires.
Go back to your dumb partner and try to start off a conversation or at least persuade them into a talk.
Ask him/her about their day.
Slowly open up whatâ€™s worrying you.
Try speaking to a friend who is of the same wavelength and can understand what you are going through.
Try bettering yourself each time and move ahead.

,
Do not continue sharing your problem with your spouse.

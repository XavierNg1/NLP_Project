Handguns take skill and practice to use.
For first time handgun owners, revolvers are probably the better choice as they are simpler.
For more experienced users, or users willing to take a formal instruction, a semi-automatic handgun may make more sense due to their increased capacity and easier follow-up shots.
Every person is different.
When hunting, a larger caliber may be required as many dangerous game have tough skin and muscles the need the extra energy to penetrate through skin and muscle to reach vital organs.

Roll out a sausage of glow-in-the-dark clay for the eyes (itâ€™s easier to divide a sausage evenly).
Split the sausage into two equal parts and roll them into balls.
Attach the balls to the front of the head, and presto!,
Split a very small black sausage of clay in half and roll up the pieces to make the pupils.
Give the cat eyelids (optional).
Shape the lids into rough semicircles and carefully affix them at a precise angle.
Carefully concentrate on the details of its body language.
Take care to make the texture of the piece as smooth as you want it with gentle rubbing, and correct any minor flaws.Finished.

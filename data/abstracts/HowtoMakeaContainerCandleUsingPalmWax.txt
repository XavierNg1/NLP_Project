Prepare the fragrance oil.
Remove the warmed containers from the oven and place on the cooling rack just prior to pouring the heated palm wax.
Pour in the fragrance oil once the palm wax reaches 200 °F (93 °C).
Take the heated palm wax off the heat and stir for two minutes to ensure a smooth consistency.

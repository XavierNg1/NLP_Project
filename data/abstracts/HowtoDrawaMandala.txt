Get a mandala template; if you don't have one, then draw a circle on a blank piece of paper with either a compass or something round (like a bowl) as a guide.
Find the centre of your mandala.
Keep your mandala symmetrical; this will make it look nice.
Draw a small shape in the middle of the circle, with a pencil or a marker.
Draw another shape outside this first shape.
Repeat it in a ring all around your centre motif.








,
Keep going, drawing new motifs in expanding rings, as you work toward the outside circle of your mandala.
Try overlapping some motifs; this creates new and interesting shapes, which still harmonize with what you've drawn so far.
You may find yourself wanting to go back and add something to a previous ring.
If you've drawn in pencil, you may want to scan or photocopy it before coloring your mandala.

Make a slug home.
Add leaves, rocks, and twigs and sticks.
Keep the habitat clean and appropriate for a slug's environment.
Give your slugs fresh food at least once every two to three days.
Make sure to discard any uneaten or old food so you do not attract fruit flies, which can kill your slugs.

Expect garden slugs to typically live for 6 months to about a year.

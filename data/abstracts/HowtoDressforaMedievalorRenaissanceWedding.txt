Ask the bride and groom what period and nationality of costuming they're going for, and how strict they're being.
Once you ascertain what sort of costuming period you need, do a little research.
If you are making costuming for you and your family, look into patterns that will let you make an outfit out of the same cloth.
Look at clothing from that time period and region, and pick something you're COMFORTABLE wearing.
If you're purchasing, talk to online vendors, and explain what you're looking for.
Hunt around for good prices.
If you're able to get a decent costume at a decent price from someone online, recommend them to others going to the wedding, even if they weren't part of the original 'bulk' order.
Once you have your costume, look up articles online about how to wear it.
Look reasonably at whether you can wear the costume in the car, or if you should change.
Wear comfortable shoes.
Have a change of clothing when you leave.
Keep your costume if you like it - it'll make a great easy Halloween costume!

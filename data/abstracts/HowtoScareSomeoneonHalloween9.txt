Decorate your house with a cute theme for Halloween.
Set out a bowl of candy on your porch, making sure it is good candy!,
Get a scary mask (ex: monster mask, but avoid a famous monster mask) and a freaky outfit.
Purchase a bottle of fake blood and splash it all over your outfit, making sure to leave some white spots in appropriate places.
With your costume and mask snapped into place, hide in a place where you won't be seen, making sure you can easily get out of it without making a fool of yourself.
Wait until kids come up to your house.
After you suddenly jump out, the kids should be afraid!

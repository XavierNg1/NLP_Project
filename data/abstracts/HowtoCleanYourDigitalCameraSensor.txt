Decide if you want to do a dry or a wet clean.
For a dry clean hold the camera over your head and, taking care to keep the nozzle away from the sensor, blow the specks of dust away.

When using a static brush make sure the batteries are charged enough.
If a dry clean does not remove all the debris then it is time for a wet clean.

,
You need to use a lint free wipe, often referred to as a "pec pad" and a fast drying cleaning fluid.
You should obtain either a wooden Popsicle stick or a flexible plastic fork knife, spoon, whatever.

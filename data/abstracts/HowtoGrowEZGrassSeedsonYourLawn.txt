Gather the materials you will need for planting.
Go out to the parts of your yard that require attention.
Take the shovel and start to ply out all the weeds and unnecessary vines or roots.
Slowly drizzle the seeds all over the area.
Put on some fertilizer.
Water the patches of seeds and continue the same process if necessary.

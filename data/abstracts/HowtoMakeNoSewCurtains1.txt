Find a flat bed sheet with a wide top hem.
Wash, dry, and iron the sheets to get rid of any shrinking, wrinkles, and fold lines.Be sure to wash the sheets according to the directions on the package or tag.
Cut the sheet in half lengthwise, if needed.
Consider hemming the cut edges for a cleaner finish.Most sheets won't fray after you cut them, but you will get a nicer finish if you hem it.
Using a seam ripper, open both ends of the top hem on each side of the sheet.
Tuck the ripped seams inside the hem for a cleaner finish.
Pass the curtain rod through the hems and hang your instant curtains.
Place the curtains to either side of the window.
Use matching ribbons as tiebacks.

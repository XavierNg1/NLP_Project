Learn the ranking system.
Don't hide out in a sniping bunker/room thinking people can't see you.
Don't go around calling people that have a General rank a noob while you're not even a private(the private is the 2nd rank; they will own you.
Use the rocket launcher, stationary machine gun (when holding you move very slowly; very good gun if your playing wolf conquest though), grenade launcher, red line grenade, shotguns, snipers and that's mostly it.

,
See how realistic this game is.
When sniping with an assault weapon, just aim and shoot at the person, don't point at their head exact, just shoot when you got him/her locked on.

,
When you aim try not to be stationary.
Try your best use wolf when at about 5 meters (16.4Â ft) because you can deal them a lot of damage when you jump and right-click.

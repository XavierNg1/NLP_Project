If your MIL calls more than once a week and can't understand why this is inconvenient, start writing e-mails.
Even though he does the whole communication, make sure you talk to her at least 2 - 3 minimum times a month, and whenever the phone is passed to you with your permission, be always in good spirits.
Let your husband/wife deal with their own mother.
Grandkids.
Also, when they call to know about the kids, don't feel obligated to say everything, just talk about the highlights and end it there.

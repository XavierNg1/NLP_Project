Whatever the crime, always ask to speak to a lawyer before answering or speaking to police.
Don't withhold any information from your lawyer.
When the court day comes, be prepared.
Get there in a calm manner.
When you get there, check in and wait patiently for your case.
Once you get in, obey the judge and address him as "Your honor.",
If you are called up on the witness stand, be ready.
During the recess period, go to to the bathroom, and/or drink some water.
When you go back in, prepare your arguments wisely, because for misdemeanors, this might be the last chance you have to get the sympathy of the jury, and for felonies, a last chance before they go home for deliberation.

Be prepared for an immediate verdict, if there is one.

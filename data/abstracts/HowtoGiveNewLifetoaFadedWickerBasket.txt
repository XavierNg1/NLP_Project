Start with an empty, "naked" basket.
Clean the basket.
Examine the basket for any broken slats or reeds.
Select the stain product and color you will apply to the basket.
Dip your brush into the stain, allowing any excess stain to drip back into the can.
Repeat the procedure on the interior sides (or walls) of the basket.
Move on to the exterior of the basket.
Examine the basket, looking for any bare areas that stain did not trickle through the reeds.
Set the basket aside or fashion a hook/hanger from a wire coat hanger and suspend it to thoroughly dry.

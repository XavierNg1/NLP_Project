Start small.
Calmly ask the child why they did what they did.
Talk to the child about the consequences of their actions.
Consider whether the child needs to be punished at all.
Look at non-physical consequences, if needed.
Make sure you are set on this plan.
Decide on the place where the spanking will be administered.
Once you have reached your destination and have come to a clear understanding, announce that the consequence of the child's actions will be a spanking.
Tell the child that they should remain in position.
Spank with an open hand, never a tool.
Remove all rings from your fingers.
Bend your child over your knee.
Relax your hand and all your limbs, with one firm hand on their back and one on their bottom.
Don't hit too hard.
Afterwards affirm your child.
Try to make the spanking a positive learning experience.
Provide unconditional love.

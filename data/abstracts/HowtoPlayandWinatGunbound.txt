Don't be intimidated.
Listen to the advice of more experienced teammates.
If you're new, pick a well rounded mobile (Mage, Ice and Armor in particular) and play with it all the time.
When picking items, a safe bet is duals (item that looks like two red bullets) or dual+ (one red and one yellow bullet).
Each mobile has a certain weight to it, that's why it's advised to practice with a certain mobile.
Think about what mobile your enemy is using.
If you get hit, it can help to move after each shot to force the enemy to adjust his shot.
Avoid tough rooms until you get better.
There are servers for beginners, use them and everyone will be friendlier and you won't get killed so easily, so you have more chances to shoot and learn.
Understand Delay.
Understand wind.
A dual often gives the enemy 2 turns in a row against you, so you only want to use it when it's a sure hit.
Your SS can be almost as strong as dual or dual+, but it's usually trickier to use, so again don't use it unless you're sure it can hit for nice damage.
Shotgun (SG) if needed.
Try to take the easiest shot possible, usually the closest enemy.
Keep your cool, take your time and you are sure to win.

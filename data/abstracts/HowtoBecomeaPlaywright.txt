Read through two or three scripts in the same genre as you intend to write.
Like with any story, start with an outline.
As the writer, you will always know exactly what you are trying to say and how very funny or sad certain parts are, but this is not always the case with an audience.
Submit the script to a theater if you have good contacts.

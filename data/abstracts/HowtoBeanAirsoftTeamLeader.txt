Get an airsoft team together.
Get together for a game or training every once in a while.
Get to know your team.
When training get a room or corner to practice with if you are an indoor or CQB team or section.
Get your gun.
Show the team your are a good player.
If you know tactics for the environment, either indoor or outdoor it is best to know what you are doing.

,
If you are a good team then everyone should know each others roles and positions.
For large events have a Platoon channel and a squad channel, with a designated radioman to listen to the Platoon channel and relay the info.
Have a grenadier if possible.
Be alert.
Have Fun!

Get images to use and go to a picture editing program.
Take the image and put it in Microsoft Powerpoint.
Now place them in separate areas and bevel them.
Now add some more effects, as in last step add different effects to each image.
Now place your snowflakes to the side and make an image that you want.
Now add some effects and recolour.
Good Luck and enjoy experimenting and trying different things.

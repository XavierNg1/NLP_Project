There is nothing more frustrating than missing one piece of hardware while building.

Measure down 1" from the top of the frame and clamp outside corner in place.
Drill holes using 1/2" for heavy hardware.
Use hammer and drive in bolts.
Repeat step 10 in a similar manner until all hardware is attached as needed.

Attach any accessories such as pipe holder, cleat angles or chain retainers.
Set float drums in the right location.
Attach floats with a 3/8" x 3" or larger lag bolt.
Just before decking, place the plastic plug in float drum.
Tighten all Hardware.

Start Decking.
Decking can be done two ways: 1.
Use a chalk line to determine where deck screws are to go - using 2" x 6" decking, use two deck screws for each stringer.
Attach cleats - drill down through decking into cleat angles with 3/8" drill.
Nail down outside corner bumpers with stainless ring shank large head nails.
Attach rub rail using the same stainless nails.
Fit the sections together and put in the pins to hold together.

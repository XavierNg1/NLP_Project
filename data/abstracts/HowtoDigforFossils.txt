Look for areas with public access, but not under direct jurisdiction of local, state, and federal park services.
Talk to the local geological, archaeological, and historical societies.
Gather some basic tools and materials, depending on the digging location and geology.
Dig material in a likely looking place in layers, removing scoops of rock-containing earth and sifting it in the "sifter, looking carefully at the stones you uncover.
Look closely at the stones, identifying the type you find.
Collect samples and interesting rocks to take home and clean up.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Think outside the box.

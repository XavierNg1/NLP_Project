Form a group outside of your favorite World of Warcraft instance.
Keep in mind once you have started a party or group for the instance, make the players feel comfortable with your character by throwing a joke or two.
Remember now that you've built a pact of trust, continue the instance without saying a word.
Note that depending on the instance, you may encounter several Mini-Bosses.
Remember when it comes time for the instance boss, your group will form a huddle.
Note that, as explained above, the strategy will probably not work, but you must adhere to it.
Remember your group has worked hard, and they may be rejoicing.
Keep this step in mind, because it is important!,
Know the Ninja Loot: As the group begins to argue and/or discuss your claim, disband from your group, and hold shift as your right click on the downed boss's corpse.

Catch a bus one of two ways, either at a bus stop or by putting your arm out like you would to catch a cab.
When you get onto the bus be sure to say hello in Spanish to everyone.
Immediately find a seat because the bus driver will start driving even if you're not seated yet and it can be dangerous.
The driver does not take payment when you get on the bus.
Once you've arrived at your destination be sure to look around you for any belongings you took on the bus and also get anything such as shopping bags or luggage that they may have placed in the back of the bus, many tourists and new expats have been known to forget their things.
If you are going the other direction away from Panama City you will need to buy a ticket at the Albrook Mall.
Once you've gotten your ticket you will go outside.

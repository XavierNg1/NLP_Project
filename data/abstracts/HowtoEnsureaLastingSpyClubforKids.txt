First, create and organize a club.
Those who know about the club and want to join must fill in an application with questions of your choice.
When inviting others to join, remember to politely request that they not tell anyone else that isn't in the club!,
For all the official members make ID cards for them.
Once you have gathered enough people (maximum in this case should be up to 15 people) gather them to have your first meeting.
Have everyone at the first meeting sign a contract.

,
Arrange another meeting a few days later or the next day.
Have a third meeting.
Find a place at your house/location that is YOUR TERRITORY that you can use as a fort.
Are your members ready?,
Double-agents should be taken out of the club!

,
Enjoy your new, long-lasting club!

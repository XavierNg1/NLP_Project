Read the steps above so that you know what you're doing.

,
Find a nice blank space (In your house selection) to make your flower path, you could make the path go from the beach to your house, from a bridge to the town hall or a path just going nowhere!,
Find a pattern to be your path, by clicking the little pencil icon at the bottom of the screen.
Make a path!,
Abort this step if the path doesn't lead to anywhere.
Finish the path.
Get some flowers.
Now go to the beginning of your path and plant all the flowers you found around the path and work your way upwards.
Now again, from where you just left off, plant all the flowers in you pockets around the path.

,
Make sure when you plant the flowers, don't plant them behind houses where you can't see them!,
That's all your flowers?,Save your game and return to the title screen,,
Click A on the Wii remote and as soon as you talk to the cat, click on other things... then Set date/time then set the date to 1 day forwards or backwards you don't want millions of weeds again, right?,Now click on your character and start the game again!,
Run to Tom Nook's store!,Plant them around your path working upwards.
Is that not enough?,
Still not enough flowers?,
Congrats.

Here are the instructions for building the battery backup system.
Assemble all the parts as shown in the diagram.
Connect the 6 feet (1.8Â m) electrical AC power cord to the relay as shown in the diagram.
If you connected the DC to AC inverter and relay according to the manufactures instructions, the electrical power for your sump pump should now flow from the electrical wall outlet through the relay and then to your sump pump.
Disconnect the AC electrical power cord from the wall outlet (This is to simulate a power failure in your home).
Take a couple of buckets of water (or hose) and fill up the hole where your sump pump is located.
Plug the power cord back into your wall outlet so the sump pump is working off of the electrical power running through your house.

Give yourself enough time to take a 15 to 20 minute bath.
Start filling your bathtub.
Add the sea salt while the tap is still running.
Turn off the tap when the tub is as full as you like it, and agitate the water with your hand.
Get into your tub and enjoy the water for 10 to 20 minutes.
Drain the tub when you are done, and rinse the salt water off with fresh water.

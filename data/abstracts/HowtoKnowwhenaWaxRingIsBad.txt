Inspect the bathroom.
Use food coloring.
Remove the toilet.
Get a good sized sponge and a bucket like the kind you use for washing a car.
The next step is to get the johnny bolts free.
Now that the toilet is free, it is time to lift it off.
Move the toilet out of the way and set it on some newspapers.
Use a stick or disposable putty knife to scrape all of the remaining wax that is on the floor flange off and throw it away.
Go to the hardware store.
Place the new johnny-bolts into the keyhole slots in the floor flange.
When you have the toilet lined up, slide each 2x4 out from under the toilet and its should sit down flush with the floor.
Finger tighten the johnny bolts.
Finally, use the Teflon tape on the toilet water supply and re-attach the supply line.

Work out the melody, if music is what starts to happen in your mind.
Try the alternative; so, write "poetry" before creating the music: Work out the lyrics first, and possibly work with another lyricist as a partner, to get the "story/poem" created, possibly for a church worship team, TV drama, theatrical stage production or a movie.
Work out the structure.

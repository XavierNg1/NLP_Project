Think about how you want to behave.
Wait before you speak.Especially if you have strong negative feelings toward someone, don’t react quickly or speak without thinking.
Enlist support.If you have a hard time getting along with a relative, let someone in your family know (like a spouse/partner or sibling) that you’d like to minimize your interactions with this person.
Enjoy yourself.
Keep the relative occupied.
Use humor.
Have an exit plan.If you fear interactions with this relative, come prepared to the event with an exit plan of why you need to leave.
Dodge recurring heated debates.
Pick your battles.Your cousin may say something really offensive that you immediately want to fire back on or correct, but take a breath and decide whether it’s worth engaging or not.
Resolve conflicts.
Say “no”.If you have a relative that seems to want things from you (money, free labor, a place to stay, etc.
Avoid passive aggressive manipulation.
Uphold your family rules.
Handle delicate situations.
Take care of yourself.
Remember it’s not about you.
Realize you can’t change this person.
Accept your relative.
Find reasons to be grateful.While you may dread family gatherings specifically because you hate having to spend time with difficult relatives, undoubtedly you can find something that you can look forward to or feel grateful for in meeting with your family.

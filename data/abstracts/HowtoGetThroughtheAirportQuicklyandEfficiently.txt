Purchase your plane ticket in advance, online or through an airline.
Pack your bags carefully, keeping in mind that you can only have one piece of luggage and a smaller, carry-on item with you on board the plane.
Arrive at the airport 2 to 3 hours before your flight's scheduled departure time.
Find the check-in counters of your airline, which are indicated by signs outside the terminal building on the departures roadway, as well as their logos on the wall and above the counters.
When asked, show the agent your ID.
Make your way to the security checkpoint assigned to your departure gate.
An agent will tell you when to walk through the metal detector, or x-ray machine to the other side of the conveyor belt where you will pick up your items.
You are now in the secure, boarding area.
Have a seat in your gate area and wait for the plane to be ready for boarding.
The gate agents will announce boarding and give you instructions.
When you get on the plane, find your assigned seat and place your luggage in the overhead bin.
Enjoy your flight!

Provide your chickens with a well-balanced feed that is at least 16% protein and has lots of vitamins and nutrients.Look for a feed that is specifically for egg-laying hens.The feed should be high in vegetable fat and proteins.Keep in mind that additional starch (from kitchen scraps or scratch grains) needs to be supplemented with more protein, as it will lower the average protein content of their diet.
Supplement your chicken feed with calcium.
Make sure your hens have plenty of water.

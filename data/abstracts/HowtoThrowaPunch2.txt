Read the warnings.
Go get a pitcher of water or a weight with a handle.
Now put down the object and hold your hand in the same position, mimicking the lightly tipped angle, with the knuckle of your forefinger leading.
Stand with both feet planted shoulder width apart, knees bent a little less than 45 degrees.
Pick a hand â€” perhaps the one you poured with.
That's it!

Be sure to dry your hair completely before starting this process.
Plug in your curling iron and start to pre-heat it.
Split your hair into fairly equal sections and run the curling iron from the base to the tip.
After each curl, pin the curl to your head with a hairpin.
Once your hair is all pinned up and curled, apply hairspray.
Release the pins and your hair.
Finished.

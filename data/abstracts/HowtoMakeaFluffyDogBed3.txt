Take two large pillows and overlap them about four to six inches lengthwise.
Sew the pillows together along the overlap where the seam of the pillow meets the other pillow.
Repeat along the second (and third, if necessary) seam.
Choose a fabric and cut out two shapes large enough to cover the pillows.
Cut out the fabric using scissors.
Individually fold the edge of the each piece of fabric inward before sewing to create a soft, rounded outside edge.
Sew three edges of the bed together using either a sewing machine or sewing by hand.
Once three sides are sewn, stuff the pillows into the shell.
Sew the remaining side of the bed together.

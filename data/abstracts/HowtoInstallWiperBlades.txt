Decide which part of the wiper you need to replace.
Buy the proper blades for your car model at an automotive-supply store.
Pull the entire wiper assembly arm away from the windshield and into a standing position.
Release the wiper blade.
Take out the new wiper.
Line the new blade up with the metal arm so that the metal hook will go through the hole in the blade.
Pull up on the blade until you hear as well as feel it click it into place.
Check the wiper arm angle.
Turn on the ignition and wet the windshield with wiper fluid to test the new wipers for proper installation.
Begin by locating the pads at end of the blade; the pads should have small tabs sticking out.
Slide the rubber insert off of the wiper arm.
Take out the new rubber insert.
Gently push the blade back down to a resting position against the windshield and then repeat with the other rubber insert.

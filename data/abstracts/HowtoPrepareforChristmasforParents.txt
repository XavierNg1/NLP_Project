If you plan to make a traditional Christmas cake from scratch then this needs to be started at least a month before Christmas.
Christmas shopping can be very stressful with all the crowds and you can't take the children with you because they will see their presents.
Christmas for kids is all about the presents but make sure that you don't just buy them toys, buy the things they actually need as well.
Many children creep around the house while their parents are in another room on the hunt for their presents.
Before you wrap the presents carefully remove them from the box and check that they are not broken or damaged.
Buy enough batteries and one extra pack of each just in case.
When you put up the decorations let the kids help.
On Christmas Eve many children have a sugar rush, get over excited and don't sleep at all.
On Christmas Eve do not give the kids anything sugary such as sweets, chocolate or fizzy pop.
Put your children to bed extra early on Christmas eve so that they won't be too tired the next day.

Have fun!

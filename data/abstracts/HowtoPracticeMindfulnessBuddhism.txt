Be conscious of where your focus lies.
Be aware of your actions.
Give your actions purpose in your mind.
Don’t live in the past.
Avoid getting caught up in the future.
Stop watching the clock.
Allow yourself to do nothing.
Let go of judgements and negative emotions.
Don’t cling to good emotions either.
Treat your feelings like the weather.
Treat others with kindness and compassion.

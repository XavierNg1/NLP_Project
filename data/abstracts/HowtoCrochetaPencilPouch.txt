Get a crotchet hook.
Take the working yarn (not the hanging piece, called the tail) and place it over the hook.
Repeat this 15-20 times until you have your desired length.
Pick your width of pouch.
Proceed your crocheting based on the following sizes:


Single:

Insert hook through the first loop hanging from it.Keep repeating rows until you think your square is big enough to fold over to hold pencils.
Cut a long piece of yarn off at the end of your last row so that you can have a leftover tail to stitch into the project.
Fold your pouch hot dog style and sew up the edges with yarn that can blend in to the project.
Grab your crochet needle and thread the yarn through the eye.Loop a knot at the end of the seam.
Stitch in any tails left in the piece.

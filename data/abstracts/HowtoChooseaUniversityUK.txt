Make sure that you start early enough.
Decide if you want to do a distance learning course (such as Open University).
Location, location, location.
Decide if you would prefer to stay close to home, or to look further afield.
Decide if you would like to be full-time or part-time.
Narrow down your search by finding which universities offer your course.
If you want to do a specific career, check that the course is accredited by the relevant organisation (for example the British Psychological Society) - their website should have a list of courses they accredit.
Check that the grades required match with your ability level.
Visit the university websites and read about your courses, the city/town and the social life.

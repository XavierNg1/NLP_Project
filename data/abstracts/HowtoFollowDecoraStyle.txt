Don't be afraid to go to thrift stores or shop at cheap stores at the mall.
Experiment with cute fabrics- browse fabric stores for cute pattern and frill and create your own skirts, tanks or pants.

,
Shopping online is huge for a non-Japanese Decora, and to get good deals.
Search for glitter eyeshadow and sticker tattoos- anything that will make you brighter.

,
Don't go out wearing Decora until you have enough accessories and layers to fit your tastes.
Put clips, extensions and bows in your hair.
Wear colorful arm bangles and necklaces.
Layer, layer, layer.
To help prevent burning out peoples eyes and even more rude comments, put your outfit up on a LJ or similar community for Decora to get feedback.

,
Carry plushies or small toys if you want to go more extreme - plushies and small plastic toys are very integral to the Decora look in Japan.
Fashionable nails are very common in most of the Japanese fashions.
Don't just throw everything together!

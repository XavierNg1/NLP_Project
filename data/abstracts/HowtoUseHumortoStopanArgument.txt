Understand the purpose of humor within an argument.
Be certain about whether or not humor is the right approach in a particular situation.
If you've decided that the situation is appropriate and that the other party may be amenable to your wit, stay even tempered and respectful as you find the right moment to insert humor into the conversation.
Insert humor here!,
Seize the gap.
Address the underlying issues later on.

Buy an aftermarket wiring harness and a mounting kit for a Honda Civic 1996-1998 which you can get at a local Future Shop or Best Buy or any other place that sells that sort of stuff.
Remove the ground on the battery.
Remove the center console and the lower dash under the steering wheel.
Open the glove box and in the top left corner (which is your left facing the glove box), there will be another Philips screw.
Push on the bottom of both sides of the glove box firmly, to find the next screw.
Go to the driver's side.
Locate and unscrew the screw that was hidden by the panel.
Unscrew the final screw that is directly in line with the one you just removed, except about 2 feet (0.6Â m) lower.

Grab the side where the two Philips screws were (next to the glove compartment) and wiggle it loose from right to left(to remove the center console).
Remove the head unit.
Detach the clip(that is currently attaching the wires to the head unit at the rear) from the head unit by pressing on both sides of it.
Begin the installation of the new head unit.

Install the mounting kit.
Get a hold of the clip that was attached to the back of the head unit.
Take these wires and strip off the insulation of all the wires.
Attach each wire to its matching color.
Wrap the exposed wire with electrical tape.
Plug in the radio antenna.
Re-attach your ground, turn your car on and test out your head unit.
Install the panels back on, if everything else is working.

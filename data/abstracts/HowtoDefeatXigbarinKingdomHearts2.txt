You would find him in the Hall of empty melodies.When the battle starts, Xigbar teleports to the air and then run around until you can use the reaction command "warp snipe"

,
When that is over, use Guard or reflect to counter attacks.
He can also teleport to other places or even change the battle arena.
When you defeat him 2 or 3 hp bars.
When you defeat 4 or 5 hp bars HE MAKES HIS ULTIMATE ATTACK!,
Then he teleports a good bit so try to finish him!

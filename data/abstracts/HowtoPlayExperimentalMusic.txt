Don't think.
Start looking at things and thinking what weird things you could do to it that would make it sound cool.
Go out and by a cheap violin bow and some rosin (its the dried tree sap stuff string players smear all over the bow hair) Try bowing stuff.
While you are at the music store, you can pick up some guitar, violin, cello, bass strings.
Enter the electronic world of music.
Now take all of your experimentation and combine it together to make sort of a super-junk-instrument of doom.
Add in real instruments if you like.
Play with other people for best results.

,
Have fun.

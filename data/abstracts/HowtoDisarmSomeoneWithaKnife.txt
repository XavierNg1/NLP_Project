Create distance between yourself and the attacker, if possible.If it turns out that you must face a knife-wielding attacker one-on-one, start by backing away.
Use an object as a shield.If you want to disarm an opponent or attacker, you will have to do so at the right moment.
Keep your body perpendicular to the attacker.Try not to stand directly in front of the attacker; this makes you more vulnerable to attacks.
Block and redirect attacks.If the attacker lunges at you before you are able to get the knife, step to the side out of his/her way.
Deflect the attacker’s arm if he or she strikes.If the attacker lunges at you and you are not able to get out of the way, grab the attacker’s arm as he/she moves toward you.
Stop an underhand knife attack.If the attacker lunges at you using an upward motion, use the blade of your hand to chop into the attacker's hand.
Throw the attacker from the ground.If the attacker lunges toward you with the knife, back away and pretend to fall down so that you are still facing the attacker.
Focus on controlling the weapon.Do not try to attack the attacker.
Get ahold of the attacker’s limb with both hands.When you are ready to remove the knife from the attacker’s hand, grab his/her arm as quickly as you can.
Injure the attacker’s hand.Slam the attacker’s hand against a hard surface as quickly as you can.
Keep the knife away.
Use a weapon if necessary and possible.If the attacker still attempts to harm you after you disarm him/her, and you cannot get away, try to use a non-deadly weapon (not the knife) to defend yourself.
Incapacitate the attacker.If you do not have any object at hand to help you, try and injure or immobilize the attacker using your own body.
Run, hide, fight.When faced with an attacker, remember RHF: run, hide, fight.
Stay as calm as possible.
Move away.
Call 911 as soon as possible.As soon as it is safe to do so (the attacker leaves, or you are able to get away), call 911 or another emergency number for assistance.

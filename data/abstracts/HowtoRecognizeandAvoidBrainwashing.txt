Understand that those who attempt to brainwash others tend to prey upon the weak and vulnerable.
Be aware of people who try to isolate you or someone you know from outside influences.
Watch for attacks on the victim’s self-esteem.
Look out for those who try to make being “part of the group” more attractive than the outside world.
Recognize that brainwashers often offer rewards when the victim has “turned.” Once the victim is completely broken and complacent, he or she can then be retrained.
Recognize new ways of thinking in the victim’s brain.
Rinse and repeat.
Look for a mixture of fanaticism and dependency.
Look for a “yes person.” Brainwashing victims will agree unquestioningly with whatever their group or leader dictates, without any regard to the difficulty of following in lockstep or the consequences of doing so.
Look for signs of withdrawal from life.
Make the subject aware that he or she has been brainwashed.
Expose the subject to ideas that contradict the brainwashing.
Encourage the subject to make his or her own decisions based upon the new information.

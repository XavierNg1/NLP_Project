Define a population to sample, e.g.
Define the disease or characteristic of interest, e.g.
Have a well-established gold standard test to determine the prevalence of disease or characteristic, e.g.
Have a test that you are interested in determining its sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for this population, and run this test on everyone within the chosen population sample.
For people that have the characteristic (as determined by the gold standard), record the number of people who tested positive and the number of people who tested negative.
To calculate the sensitivity, divide TP by (TP+FN).
To calculate the specificity, divide TN by (FP+TN).
To calculate the positive predictive value (PPV), divide TP by (TP+FP).
To calculate the negative predictive value (NPV), divide TN by (TN+FN).

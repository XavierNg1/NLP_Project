Firstly, find your subject.
Get them to put their arms out straight yet relaxed (kind of like a stereotypical zombie.),
Tell them to imagine, that in their left hand, they are holding a bucket.
While that's going on, tell them that in their other hand, around their wrist to be precise is a string.
Watch their left arm.
Have them look at their arms.

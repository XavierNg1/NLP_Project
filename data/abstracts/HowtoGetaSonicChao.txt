Hatch any color Chao from an egg of your choice.
Keep the Chao neutral by raising it with any hero and dark character together.
Get either green chaos drives, or animals that give your Chao speed: bunnies, cheetahs, skeleton dogs, etc.

,
Have your hero and dark character take turns giving the Chao the drives/animals.
Make sure that your Chao's run stat is the highest (raised last because it will not evolve to be the right type).
Be patient.
Wait.
Once your Chao is three Chao years old, you should have an advanced Sonic Chao!

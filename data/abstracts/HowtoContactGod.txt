Know how you are going to address your God: his greatest attribute is that He is our Heavenly Father, and that He loves us all.
Pray to God, as in one of these four categories: a) Petition; b)Gratitude, c)Repentance; and d)Praise.
Be humble when praying to God.
Ask the angels and saints in heaven to pray to God for you (Eg: Mary...etc), or even invoke the names of holy men or women when praying (Eg: God Of Abraham...etc.),
Conclude your prayer with "Amen."

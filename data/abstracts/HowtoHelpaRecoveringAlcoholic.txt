If you spend a great deal of time with a recovering alcoholic, it is of utmost importance that you do not drink around them.
Do not take them to bar and grill restaurants.
Let them know you stand by their decision and that it is the best decision.
Make sure the recovering alcoholic knows that they can depend on you in moments of weakness.

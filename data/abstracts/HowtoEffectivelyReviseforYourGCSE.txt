Revise in short bursts.
Go through each subject you are doing for GCSE and discover what you don't understand.
Buy revision guides for all of your subjects.
Try to find somewhere where you won't be disturbed.
Discover what type of learner you are.
The three types of learner:

Auditory learners may have a knack for ascertaining the true meaning of someone's words by listening to audible signals like changes in tone.
Take breaks every 45 minutes when you revise.
If you don't understand something, ask your teachers, parents, older brothers and sisters for help.

,
Get past exams from teachers or off the Internet.
If you don't understand something, write it out again, and again, and again until you fully understand it!

,
Drink plenty, rest plenty, and play often (but less as the exams approach - there'll be time for social lives afterwards!),
Once you know the date of your exam, aim to start revising at least a month before.

First think-what kind of music do you want to play?,
If you like jazz/blues, you may want to get a hollow-body guitar.
If you like Folk/acoustic rock, Martin and Taylor are the way to go- if you're willing to shell out more.
If you like heavy metal or Post-Hardcore, Schecter, ESP/LTD, Ibanez, and Jackson are a few major brands of guitar that have a great bang for buck effect.

For modern or classic rock, Fender and Gibson are great brands.
Do some more research.
Don't be afraid to go used.
Build your own stuff.

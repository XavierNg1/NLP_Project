Okay, now that you've made your account you're going to want to get started training.
Get your gear.
Once you have this you can train - up to level 15 range, chickens!,
Once you have 30 ranged it's off to barbarians/Minotaurs.
Buy yourself green dragonhide armor at 40 range, however you gotta keep the same body.
Well the final place to train and by far the most boring is where we're going now!

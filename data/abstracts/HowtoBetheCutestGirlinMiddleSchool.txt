Do something about your weight.
Wear proper clothing.
Put on makeup, but don't go overboard.
Remember the saying "you are what you eat".
Have good hair.
Try to have a shower every day, and if you can't, at least wash. One day you're smelling like a daisy, then you turn 12, and you have to have a shower every day or you smell like a wet dog.
Have good attitude.

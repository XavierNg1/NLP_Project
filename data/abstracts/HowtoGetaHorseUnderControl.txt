Relax if your horse is acting up while you are riding.
Check your riding position.
Try riding him in a tight circle or a figure eight if your horse is still jumpy.
Think about why your horse is misbehaving.
Inspect the horse's tack.
Consider that the girth may be rubbing.
Check your horse's feet for any foreign bodies or for any swelling or bruising/ulcers.
Try changing the way you are controlling the horse.
Take off a crop, double bridle, or spurs if you're using them.
Consult your veterinarian if the tack fits and you're riding well but the bad behavior continues.
Spin the horse in a tight circle if you ever feel like you are out of control on a horse.

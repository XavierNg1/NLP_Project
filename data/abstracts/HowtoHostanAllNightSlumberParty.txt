Invite guests that are nice, and friendly.
Invites.
If you have a big finished basement hold the party there!,
Keep your guests entertained, right?,
If drama springs up in your party; don't pick a side - even if someone is seriously acting up.
If you can, play games like Bloody Mary and Ghost in the Graveyard.
You should set up a small stand next to the sleeping bags so that you can set bowls of Doritos, Pretzels, Chex Mix, etc. onto it.
You need energy drinks, Mountain Dew, Pepsi -- anything that has caffeine in it so that you will stay buzzed.
Have pillow fights.

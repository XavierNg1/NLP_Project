You become what you think about most, but you also attract what you think about most.
Your thoughts cause your feelings.
Begin to talk about what you want with others and enroll them in your dream, your desire, your want.
Remember "I am..." is a powerful creative statement.
Take inspired action that aligns you with what you want.

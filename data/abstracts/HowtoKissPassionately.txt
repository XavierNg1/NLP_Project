Make sure your breath is minty fresh and clean.
Approach the kiss with confidence.
Set the mood.
Lean in and tilt your head slightly.
Start slowly.
Let yourself linger between kisses.
Open your lips slightly.
Consider the French Kiss.
Be sensually aggressive.
Try some necking.
Keep your arms busy.
Try a ten-second kiss.
Do not let yourself be distracted by anything.

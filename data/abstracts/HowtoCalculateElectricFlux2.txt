Know the formula for the electric flux through a closed surface.
Draw an imaginary Gaussian surface around your charge.
Determine the surface area of your Gaussian surface.Determine the electric field going through your Gaussian surface.
Multiply the magnitude of your surface area vector by the magnitude of your electric field vector and the cosine of the angle between them.Do not forget to add the proper units for electric flux.

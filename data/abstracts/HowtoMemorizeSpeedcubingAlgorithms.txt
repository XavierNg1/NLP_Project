Don't learn too many algorithms at once.
Start incorporating the algorithms you have learned into your everyday solving.
Learn similar algorithms together.
Learn 2-look OLL before learning full OLL.
Learn full PLL before full OLL.
If you are having trouble following the standard cube notation, practice by doing scramble algorithms from the WCA Scramble Generator at https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/history/files/scrambles/scramble_cube.htm.
(For F2L and OLL cases) Give the cases names.
Split up the work with a friend.
Memorize basic triggers.
Keep a notebook of algorithms you're trying to learn.
Try following certain pieces or colors throughout an algorithm.

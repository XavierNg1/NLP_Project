Bring out your birth chart to look at and refer to.
Look over to Venus to begin with.
Look up your favourite books or websites for the delineations (meanings attributed) for each of these.
Repeat this process with your Mars and your Moon, and, if they haven't already come into the picture, with your fifth, seventh and eighth houses.
Bring what you've gleaned altogether to formÂ your best method for attracting positive mates.
Look to Venus.
Look to Mars.
Use the list to help bring the awareness of both Mars and Venus into your body.
Add to the picture by looking up your Eros (433), Cupid (763), Amor (1221), Lilith (h13 - BML) and Priapus (h22).
Go back to the Moon list and look to see what it says about what needs you seek to get met by others (Moon in Cancer: nurturing, emotional closeness).
In putting these together, even though this approach is looking from the Moon first, it works best if you give Venus and Mars more expression.
Look to your eighth house and the sign on the cusp, as way to enhance feeling comfortable getting intimate for the first time.
Go out and find that partner.

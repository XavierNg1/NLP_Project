See if any local resources offer a beekeeping course.
Read up on beekeeping.
Purchase a "starter" kit.
Get some bees.
Very broad stroke here but basically you set up your hive in a place where there are nearby flowers.
You will add another deep frame on top of that when they have the lower one full.
When they almost fill the second you add a screen on top of the two that has a grid large enough to let bees through but not the queen.
They may fill that shallow body.
This is only a basic idea of how it works.

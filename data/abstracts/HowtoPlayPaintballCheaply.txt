Consider renting equipment.
Put priority on your gun/marker: This is the most important piece in paintball, your gun.
Get a mask: Your mask is your required safety gear at all fields and anywhere you play.
Consider your hopper/loader, air source, and extras: These aren't as important as the paintball gun and mask, but without them you can't play.
Buy protective gear if you want and can.
Don't forget about paint.
Find somewhere to play.
Do your homework.
Look into used equipment.

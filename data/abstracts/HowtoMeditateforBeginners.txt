Think about what you want to achieve with your meditation.
Find a distraction-free area.
Use a meditation cushion.
Wear comfortable clothes.
Choose a time when you’re comfortable.
Have a timer at hand.
Sit on your cushion or chair with a straight back.
Don’t fret about what to do with your hands.
Tilt your chin as though you’re looking downward.
Set your timer.
Keep your mouth closed as you breathe.You should both inhale and exhale through your nose when meditating.
Focus on your breathing.This is what meditation’s all about.
Observe your breath, but don’t analyze it.The goal is to be present within each breath, not to be able to describe it.
Bring your attention back to your breath if it wanders.
Don’t be too hard on yourself.

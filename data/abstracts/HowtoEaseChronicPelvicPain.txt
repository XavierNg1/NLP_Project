Start by identifying the cause.
Take over-the-counter painkillers.Over-the-counter (OTC) painkillers can reduce levels of pain by interrupting the production of a certain chemical called prostaglandin which controls pain sensations.
Get a prescription for stronger painkillers.Your doctor might prescribe stronger, narcotic painkillers if the simple painkillers are not working to relieve your symptoms.
Try birth control pills.
Treat bacterial infections with antibiotics.Chronic pelvic pain that is caused by an infection is commonly treated with antibiotics.
Consider taking antidepressants.These drugs can be helpful in treating several chronic pain syndromes, so they are sometimes prescribed for women with chronic pelvic pain who do not suffer from depression.
Look into counseling.Chronic pain may be caused by psychological factors such as depression, stress or personality disorder.
Ask your doctor about transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).With this therapy, electrodes are used to transmit electrical impulses into the nerve pathways, thereby helping doctors to determine and relax areas of tight muscles.
Opt for trigger point injections.TPI is a procedure used to treat painful areas of pelvic muscle that contain trigger points.
Undergo surgery as a last resort.Surgery is commonly the last resort if all other pain relief measures fail.
Eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids.
Exercise regularly.
Use a combination of heat and cold.Applying heating packs or cold ice to your pelvic area can help to diminish pain and to decrease inflammation.
Try alternative therapies.
Know the possible causes of chronic pelvic pain.Chronic pelvic pain sometimes occurs for no apparent reason and without specific cause.
Recognize the symptoms associated with chronic pelvic pain.
Understand how chronic pelvic pain is diagnosed.Diagnosing chronic pelvic pain may involve a process of elimination as several disorders may cause pelvic pain.

Decide what aspect of love you want to write about.
Think of some characters.
Work out your plot, and go over it.
Read it through and make sure you're satisfied with it.
Make the plot realistic.
Get some inspiration.
Use romantic language, if appropriate.
If on unrequited love, use really sad words that are full of emotion.
Consider including conflict.
Remember: a happy-ever-after ending doesn't always guarantee a good love story.
If it's easier, don't take any notes before writing.

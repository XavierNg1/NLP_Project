Turn on the spectrophotometer.
Clean cuvettes or test tubes.
Load proper volume of sample into the cuvette.
Prepare a control solution.
Wipe the outside of the cuvette.
Choose and set the wavelength of light to analyze the sample with.
Calibrate the machine with the blank.
Remove the blank and test the calibration.
Measure the absorbance of your experimental sample.
Repeat the test with successive wavelengths of light.Your sample may have multiple unknown compounds that will vary in their absorbance depending on wavelength.
Calculate the transmittance and absorbance of the sample.
Plot the absorbance values versus the wavelengths on a graph.
Compare your absorbance spectrum plot to known plots of specific compounds.

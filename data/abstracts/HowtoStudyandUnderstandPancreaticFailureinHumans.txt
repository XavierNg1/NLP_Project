Study the causes of pancreatic failure.
The process of pancreatic insufficiency refers to primarily to the exocrine pancreas.
Know the enzymes that are secreted by the pancreas.
One of them is called amylase.
This enzyme is also secreted by the salivary glands in the mouth.
Proteins are also digested in the stomach by the enzyme pepsin.
In addition lipase deficiency can have remarkable effects on the digestive system that can be manifested as steatorhea or passing fatty stool.
These enzymes can in turn autodigest the pancreas its self.
The treatment of this medical condition can be done through the administration of supplementary amounts of pancreatic enzymes that are called pancreatin.

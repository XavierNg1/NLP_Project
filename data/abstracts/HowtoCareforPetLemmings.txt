When you get pet lemmings, it is a good idea to get two of the same sex.
It is vitally important that you get the cage for your lemmings before you get the pets themselves.
Make sure that you have sufficient bedding and toys for your new pet lemmings to play with.
This is the difficult bit – the pet lemming’s diet.

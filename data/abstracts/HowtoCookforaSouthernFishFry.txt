Select your fish.
Set up a propane cooker and a simple table for your preparation steps.
Prepare your fish.
Shake the fish pieces in the meal until they are thoroughly coated.
Heat the oil in your cooker to about 330-350 degrees (F), being careful not to allow it to get too hot.
Watch the fish carefully as they cook.
Begin preparing hushpuppies as the fish are frying.
Chop a whole onion finely, place it into a suitable container, and add eggs and milk.
Remove the last of your fish, and begin dropping the hushpuppies into the hot oil.
Fry the hushpuppies until golden brown, removing them as your did the fish, previously.
Serve your fish and hushpuppies with baked beans, cole slaw, potato salad, cheese grits, or other choices of side dishes and a tall glass of iced tea.

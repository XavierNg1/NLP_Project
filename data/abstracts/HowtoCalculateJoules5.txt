Use the steps below to calculate energy flow in an electrical circuit.
Choose a resistor.
Connect the resistor to a current source.
Run a current through the circuit for a set period of time.
Measure the strength of the current.
Use the formula P = I2 x R. To find the power, multiply the square of the current by the resistance.
Multiply the power by the amount of time elapsed.

Number four different sizes of circular containers or lids.
Get a non-stretchy, non-kinky string and a meter-stick, yardstick or ruler.

,
Make a chart (or table) like the following one:
Circumference | diameter | quotient C / d =Â ?,
Measure accurately around each of the four circular items by wrapping a string snugly around it.
Straighten and measure the part of the string that you marked as the distance around the circle.
Turn the container upside down so you can find and mark the center on the bottom so that you can measure the diameter using decimals (also called decimal-fractions).

,
Measure across each circle exactly through the center of each of the four items with a straight edge measure (meter-stick, yardstick or ruler).
Divide each circumference by the same circle's diameter.
Average the four answers to the division problem by adding those four quotients and dividing by 4, and that should give a more accurate result (for example, if your four divisions gave you: 3.1 + 3.15 + 3.1 + 3.2 = ____ /4 = ____?,
Finally, take the diameter string and use it to cut its length off the circumference string three times.

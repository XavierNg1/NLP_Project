The industrial process of making cardboard boxes uses a machine called a corrugator.
The ridged sheet is made by running paper through the corrugator.
A flat sheet of paper is glued to each side of the ridged sheet.
The large sheet of corrugated cardboard is then cut based on the desired size and shape.

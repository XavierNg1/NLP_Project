When your server approaches your table, give them your attention.
Respond to the server's greeting.
Pay attention to the special off-the-menu items announced by the server, so they won't have to announce them again later.
After your server has taken your drink order, this is the time for you to decide what you would like to eat.
When it comes time to place your food order, be audible and clear.
Let the waiter decide who places their order first.
Be patient.
When your food arrives, make sure you have what you ordered.
A good server will come back to your table in two minutes to "check back" on you to make sure everything is to your liking.
When it is time for the server to clear the plates, let them do it.
Decide if you would like dessert and coffee when offered.
When they present you with the check, simply pay it.
Compute your tip.
As you leave, look around your table to make sure you didn't leave any of your personal belongings.

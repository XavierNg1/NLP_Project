Try to remember the sweet memories that makes you smile.
Try to write a journal or series of letters about him/her and the time you spent together.
Every time in your work when you become frustrated, just try to remember the inspiration you got when you saw him/her.

Sometimes, pause in your life.
Don't mess your life in his/her memory, but try to remember this is as an inspiration in your life.
Listen to songs which make you happy, instead of those which make you sad .It always helps.

Hang out with your friends and enjoy the night.

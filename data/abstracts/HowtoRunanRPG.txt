Most RPGs on the market will provide you with a section on how to run it...
Prepare, prepare, prepare.
As well as the preparation of the game itself, you'll usually be expected as GM to provide the venue.
When players first arrive, start getting early arrivals into the game with discussions of character background, what they want out of the game, and what they think of current/past plot lines.
Starting campaigns is hard.
If you're indecisive and overly loose in your GMing, your players might start feeling adrift, and pointless, without a plot to follow.
Now you've got those basics, here's the weirder suggestions from my time spent behind the GM's screen.
Never tell a player 'no'.
If someone proposes an action that will dis-rail or bypass your planned story, ask yourself these questions: Can I make another story with this?,
Change things.
Above all, have fun.

Be aware of any yellow-green gas floating around with the strong smell of bleach.
Move quickly into an area with clean air in order to minimize exposure to the gas.
Grab a cotton pad or any fabric and soak it in urine.
Remove all clothing that may have been exposed to the gas, being sure not to let the clothes touch your face or head.
Clean your body thoroughly with a lot of soap and water.
Call emergency services and wait for help to arrive.

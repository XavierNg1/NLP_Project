Set up a plan.
Put on your shoes before leaving.
Sneak out the back door if possible.
Close any doors in between the door that you're going out of and your parents.
Open the door only as wide as you need to fit through.

,
Open the door really quickly.
If your parents get up a lot in the middle of the night and check the locks, make sure you lock the door behind you and bring a key with you so you can get back in.

,
Getting back in...

,
Getting back into the house through the backyard can be hard and noisy.
If you have sticky locks, to ensure that it's noiseless when you unlock your door, put a little spit on the key.As soon as you get back inside, take off your shoes and socks and take down your decoy carefully

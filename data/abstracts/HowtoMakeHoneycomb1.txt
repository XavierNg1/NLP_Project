Sift your baking soda ahead of time to remove any chunks.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with lightly buttered parchment paper.
Measure your ingredients in advance.
Combine the honey, corn syrup, and sugar in a very large heavy-bottomed pan.
Add just enough water to wet the sugar, about 1/4 cup.
Set the heat to medium-high and cook without stirring.
Cook until the mixture is a light amber color or a candy thermometer reaches 300F/150C.
Remove the pan from the heat to start cooling.
Dump in the sifted baking soda and whisk the pot vigorously and quickly.
Immediately pour into the prepared baking sheet and cool at room temperature for 1-2 hours.

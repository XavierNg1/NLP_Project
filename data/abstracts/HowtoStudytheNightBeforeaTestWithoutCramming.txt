Get ready to focus.
If you have been procrastinating online (which you most likely have), then close all the other tabs on your computer except this one and what you need to study (which shouldn't be much).
Begin focusing.
Gather all the materials you need.
Begin by skimming through the entire chapter.
Next, look at your notes you have and change them if need be.
Decide how much time you have taken up already: it should be no more than an hour.

,
If you have enough time, go back and look at your classwork and homework assignments.
If you don't have enough time, then look at your quizzes instead.
Study your notes next.
Finally, go on to the study guides your teacher provided or if you created for yourself.
If it's not too late, then do something quiet and relaxing until 10 minutes before bed (and choose to go to bed as early as possible tonight), such as reading a calming book, knitting, or anything but getting on your computer and losing track of time!

,
10 minutes before bed, review your study guide one last time.
Go to bed early.
Get up approximately 10 minutes earlier than normal, and review the bare minimum of your study guide.
If possible then glance at it again before the test, but don't worry and go berserk about it.
Good luck!

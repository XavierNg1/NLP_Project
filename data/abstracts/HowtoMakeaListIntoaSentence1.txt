Let’s begin with a simple grocery list.
Write down the subject and verb.
Add in the list of items.
Note that before the last item in the list, you use “and.” Some grammarians debate whether the comma before the “and” is appropriate; in fact, there is so much debate, it has it’s own special name, the serial comma or the Oxford comma.

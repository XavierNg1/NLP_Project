Locate a suitable injection site.
Don't worry about sterilising the injection site in an emergency.Medical professionals working in a hospital environment will often do so, especially for an IV; this practice is also more common in the US than in the UK or other countries.
Hold the syringe in your hand like you would a dart.
Insert the needle quickly, at a 90 degree angle.
Slowly and gently, press down the contents of the plunger until all of the liquid in the syringe is emptied into the thigh.
Press down gently on the injection site, using a clean tissue or an alcohol wipe to stop any bleeding.

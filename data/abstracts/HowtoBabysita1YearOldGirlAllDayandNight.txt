Get all the information about what the child likes.
Arrive at the parents' house early and introduce yourself to the baby.
If she becomes restless, she might be missing her mommy or daddy, or need a diaper change.
Find out what she likes: Engage her, with a toy, a board book, even regular books full of interesting animal pictures, point to the pictures and try naming them to her.
Keep to her food timetable.
After lunch, occupy her with television for a little while, if you have confirmed that this is OK with the parents.
If she starts crying hysterically, try to find out what is bothering her, lack of sleep?,
At bath time, fill the baby bath with water at a suitable temperature.
Carefully Wash her hair and body with whatever the parents have left for you.
Dry her off and put her diaper on and put her pyjamas on.

If it's cold weather, consider whether she needs a singlet underneath her pyjamas or socks on her feet.

Place her in front of a mirror and see if she enjoys it, tell her about the pretty baby in pretty clothes and try to entertain her.
At dinner, cook her something you have arranged with the parents.
Put her into bed at the time the parents always do.
Go into her room and place her carefully in the crib.
If she is still awake when you read the story, try singing softly to her.
When she is asleep, put her night light on and leave the room quietly.
Now do whatever you left undone before.
Tell the parents about anything you may have noticed about their child.

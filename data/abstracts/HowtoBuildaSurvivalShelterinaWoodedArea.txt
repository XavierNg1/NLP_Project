Know that there is nearly always a way to build a shelter in the wilderness and that it is not very hard to do.
If it is night, don't move from where you are.
Find an area clear of large rocks and roots.
Find a tree, boulder, rock face, or other large object to be the base for your shelter.
Begin gathering wood.
Starting with the larger pieces of wood you have collected, lean them against your object.
Make your shelter wind and waterproof.
Be creative.

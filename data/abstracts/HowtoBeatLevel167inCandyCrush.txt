Start matching candies near the bottom of the playing board first, and work your way up.
Clear as many candies from the middle of the board first before focusing on matches near any of the four chocolate spawners.
Match any candies adjacent to the meringue squares whenever possible.
Clear chocolate squares only if doing so will help you clear jellies.
Focus on making special candies that can help you clear all jellies at a faster rate.
Watch for the chocolate.

Take your time.

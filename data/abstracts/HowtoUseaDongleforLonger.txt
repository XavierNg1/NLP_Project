Understand how the internet works.
With low data (3gb or less) try not to download much or anything at all.
Limit your emails and make email short as the more words and files in an email the bigger size in memory it's going to have.
Once you're on a page and providing you don't refresh it, it shouldn't take any data.
Disconnect from the internet whenever you're not using it.
Try to use free wifi where possible.

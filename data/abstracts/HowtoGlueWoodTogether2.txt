Choose yellow carpenterâ€™s glue for indoor furniture projects.
Set your pieces of wood atop a worktable or surface.
Apply a bead of glue to one side of the joint that will be glued together.
Place the wood pieces together firmly.
Start clamping the wood pieces down first.
Clamp the wood pieces toward each other with bar clamps.
Look for evidence that there is the same amount of glue pressing out of the joint at either end.
Wait one hour to remove this bead of glue.
Keep the pieces clamped for two hours or longer.

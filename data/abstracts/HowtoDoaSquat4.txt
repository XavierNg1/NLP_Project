Try dumbbell squats to start building muscle if you can't accomplish barbell squats yet.
Assume the plie ("PLEE-ay") form.
Try a front squat to work new muscles heads and grips.
Try overhead squats to really start building muscle.
Keeping your upper body with the same form, stagger your legs.
Slightly lower the bar down on your shoulders with normal squats for new muscle groups.

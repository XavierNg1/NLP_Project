Use your fingers to pull apart some wool into tufts.
Lay the tufts out on a baking sheet, overlapping each row like scales on a fish.
Lay out more tufts in a second layer with the fibers going perpendicular to the last one.
Repeat the first two layers, if desired, for a thicker felt sheet.
Cover the layers with a piece of tulle or sheer polyester fabric.
Make your felting solution and pour it into a spray bottle.
Spray the wool down, then gently massage it with a piece of soapy bubble wrap.
Continue pressing on the wool until the fibers come together.
When the wool is ready, transfer it to a sheet of bubble wrap and peel off the tulle or polyester fabric.
Roll up the bubble wrap tightly.
Roll the bubble wrap tube across a flat surface for about five minutes.
Rinse the sheet with cold water, then squeeze it to drain off the excess water.
Lay the wool out some place flat to dry.
Use your felted wool.

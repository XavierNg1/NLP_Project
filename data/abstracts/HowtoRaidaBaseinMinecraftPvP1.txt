Wait until night.
Do a reconnaissance.
If you are near or just next to the line of sight of the guards or sentries, dig a one-block trench down and move to the unguarded part of the base, wherever it is.

,
Time for the fun!,
Be prepared for an intense sword fight as the enemy will know you are here.
Once you're finished looting (or griefing) or whatever, exit the base through the hole.
Done.

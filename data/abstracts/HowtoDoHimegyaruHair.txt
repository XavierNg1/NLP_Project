To do this style, you must have clean hair.
Take down the sections you pinned back before.
While you wait for these to dry, heat up a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) or 3/4 of an inch curling iron.
Curl each section of your hair holding it for at least 10 seconds.
Once you have curled your hair all the way around, spray lightly with your favorite hair spray (very lightly!),
Spray lightly again.

,
Remove the rollers when they are completely ready.
Gently curl just the ends of these sections.
When you are satisfied with your style, give it one last spray to lock in the hold.

,
If you want to girl it up a little for a date or dance, you can add a cute bow, headband, or clip.
Show off your cute Hime hair!

Stir together the all-purpose cream and sweetened condensed milk in a bowl.
Lay the graham crackers across the bottom of an 8-inch (20.32 centimeters) square pan.If you need to, break or cut the crackers along the perforated lines so that they fit.
Fill the cracks between the graham crackers with finely crumbled graham crackers.
Spread a ¼-inch thick layer of cream on top of the graham crackers.Use a rubber spatula to scoop up a generous amount of the cream mixture, and spread it across the graham crackers.
Add a layer of drained cocktail fruits followed by another ¼-inch thick layer of cream.
Repeat the graham cracker, cream, fruit, cream layer.
Garnish with extra fruits and/or crushed graham crackers.
Chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.This will allow the cream to harden up and the flavors to blend together.

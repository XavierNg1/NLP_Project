Care for your looks and style.
Be outgoing: shyness is going to hurt you in the long run.
Join clubs or sports, but you must like it, because if you don't, people will see that and no one likes someone that just is there because they want popularity.

,
Treat each person you meet as friends -- they'll give you attention for it.

,
Have a cheery attitude.
Talk and be social.
Be nice!,
ALWAYS make people feel welcome.

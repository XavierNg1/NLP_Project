Be an example.
Observe whether this is the time and place to talk about it.
Be sensitive.
Get clarification.
Listen to their feelings.
Challenge ideas with questions, not comments.
Know what you're talking about.
Remember that many people buy from pet stores and breeders on a whim, because something is cute.
If they have already gotten a pet from a "problem" source (pet store or breeder) instead of "solution" source (shelter or rescue), skip the lecture about it.
Remember, if your conversation didn't convert them to your full idea set, you have still succeeded in planting the seed.

Avoid chocolate and other candy.
Put your dog in a safe place, either a separate room or his crate, when the trick-or-treaters are coming by.
Don’t leave your dog around kids without supervision.
Be careful about placement of electrical cords for decorations.
Don’t leave candles unattended.
Make sure that your dog’s costume is the right fit.
Watch out when the door is open.
Walk your dog before the festivities begin – all those costumes can be scary.

If the noise is bothering him, try adding background sounds (radio, TV) to distract him from the neighborhood hubbub.

,
Be careful when out walking your dog after Halloween – loose candy can be found and he may grab a big piece if he sees it before you do.

,
Think twice about taking him out with your family to trick or treat.
Tell kids the dangers of the treats and to not feed the dog.

,
Be firm.
If you take your dog with you, do not take him up to a stranger’s door – the resident dog may not take kindly to that and it could end up being a bummer.
Do not leave your dog outside.
It may seem like a lot, but the truth is that Halloween is a fun time for parents and kids and can easily be fun for dogs too.

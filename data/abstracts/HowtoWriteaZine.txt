Figure out your style.
Now that you have your style, you want to brainstorm all the ideas you have for your zine.
It's time for picking which subject matter you really want to include in your zine.
This is the exciting part.
Pick one thing at a time to complete before moving onto the next thing, or if you're great at multi-tasking, work on a couple things simultaneously!,
If you've interviewed some people, or been to see some live music/films and are writing reviews, it's now writing time.
Be descriptive.
So all your material is written up and ready to go.
Be open to constructive criticism on the content itself.
When laying out your zine, make it visually appealing in a way that's personal to you.
It's a good idea to make the cover last.
Create the kind of zine you would love to read yourself.

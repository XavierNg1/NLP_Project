Buy and learn how to play an instrument.
Form a band with some of your friends.
Decide on a band name and logo with your friends.
Wear rocker clothes during school.
Perform on stage, once your band gets good.
Prepare to become popular and have a lot of people on you.
If you ever want to become a real star, beyond middle school or high school, you have to be a good band first of all, but then you'll have to get signed to a record label and get airplay, unless you decide to be an indie band.
Have fun, (potential) rocker!

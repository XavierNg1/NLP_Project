Learn about its role in quantum mechanics.
Consider that the solution of the Schroedinger equation for a harmonic oscillator is not straightforward such as its classical analogue.
Note that this method of treating the bond between two atoms as a harmonic oscillator is a fairly good approximation that gives good theoretical results that are comparable to experimental results.

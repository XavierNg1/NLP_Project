Understand that the best first step to knowing someone's sexual orientation is to ask them.
Make sure you ask respectfully and avoid slurs that can be considered rude.
Understand that not everyone chooses to label their sexual orientation.
If you're not in the position to ask someone about their orientation, look at their past relationships if at all possible.
Consider prior knowledge about someone to be a gateway to ask them about whether or not they are pansexual.

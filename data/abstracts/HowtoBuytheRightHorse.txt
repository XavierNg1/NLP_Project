Inform your trainer that you are in the market for a horse, and ask if she/he will help you look.
Start looking for horses everywhere.
Once you've found a contender, set up a date to go visit the barn where the horse is stabled, and ride him or her.
Once you've decided on your favorite of the horses you've ridden, or if you just like one, it is wise to take it to your barn on trial.
If you've decided after your trial that you still want this horse, have a trusted vet come out and perform a vet-check.
If the horse's results come back without problem, or with very minor problems, and you still like him, then you need to really start thinking about if this is the horse you want to spend your money on.

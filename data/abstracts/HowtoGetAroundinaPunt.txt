Hire a punt.
Stand at the stern of the boat.
To lift the pole, raise your right hand and allow the pole to slide through your left hand.
Angle the pole so that it is pointing slightly underneath the boat, then throw it downwards, allowing it to slide through your hands.
When the pole hits the river bed, tighten your grip and begin to push downwards.
Once your hands have reached the top of the pole, bend down to give a final shove.

,
If the river bed feels soft, give the pole a slight twist to release it from the mud.

,
Stand upright and allow the pole to trail behind you.
Prepare for the next stroke by lifting the pole out of the water in the manner described above, gradually rotating it back to vertical at the same time.

,
Repeat this cycle a few times per minute to keep the punt moving.

Lightly grease a lollipop mold with cooking spray.
Combine the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a small saucepan over medium heat.
Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan.
Bring the mixture to a boil, then continue to cook it until it reaches the "hard-crack" stage.
Take the saucepan off the stove, then stir in your flavoring oil and gel food coloring, if desired.
Wait for the mixture to stop bubbling, then pour it into your molds using a metal spoon.
Insert the lollipop stick.
Wait for the candy to harden before you take it out of the mold.

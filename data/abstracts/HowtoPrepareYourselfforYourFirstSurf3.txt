Grab your board and approach the water.
Paddle out until you find a small wave, even whitewash is good to start with (but even better it it's got some projectile juice!).
There is a moment when your insane efforts yield nothing, when your efforts do not project you farther forward - that is when the wave has you!,
RELAX!,
Come crashing down with the wave.
Repeat as often as possible.

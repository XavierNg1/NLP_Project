Make sure the safety is on, the chamber unloaded, and the barrel pointed away from you in a safe direction.
Determine what gauge (bore diameter) your shotgun is so you can select the right size shells.
Place the butt of the stock on your left thigh while sitting.
Place a single shell against the loading flap just ahead of the trigger guard.
Using your thumb, push the shell straight up into the loading flap until you hear and feel a distinct click.
Repeat until the magazine tube is full.
Hold in the action release button and pump the slide backwards and then forwards with a reasonable amount of force to load the chamber.

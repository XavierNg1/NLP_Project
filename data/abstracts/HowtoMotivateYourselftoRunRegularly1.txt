Begin slowly.
If you’re out of shape, and especially if you’re pretty overweight (20-plus pounds or more), start by walking 20-30 minutes, a few times a week.
If you feel you’re ready for running now, or if you’ve done the above walking routine for at least a month and are ready to incorporate running, start with run-walking.
If you think you can run without the walking, do it for short periods at first — 10 minutes, then 12, then 15, and so on.
Remember that the key principle is this: your body will adapt if you give it time.
Accept that you’ll be tempted to ignore this advice and be more ambitious.

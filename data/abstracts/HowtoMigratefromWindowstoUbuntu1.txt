On the PC, download and install Mozilla Thunderbird unless you are already using it.
If you are using Outlook express or Microsoft Outlook on Windows, Click "Tools" on the top menu bar once you have started Thunderbird.
Right click on the folder you imported (It is probably named xxx import, where "xxx" stands for the name of the e-mail client you imported the account from), hover over "import/export", then "Export all messages in the folder" and click "EML format".
On the Ubuntu computer, download and install Mozilla Thunderbird (you can find it in Ubuntu's Software Center).

Step in with your stronger foot first.
Keep your weaker hand on the side of the ball, just enough to keep the ball balanced on your hand.








,
Hold the ball with the tips of your fingers, as though you are holding a waiter's tray.
Extend your shooting hand fully when you are letting go of the ball (this is part of follow through).
Use your legs when you shoot, bending the knees (not a full squat), then to elevate quickly, rising: that is, straighten your legs as you shoot.
Work up to shooting three pointers, one angle at a time to build muscle memory for perfecting hand and eye coordination.
Always remember.
Always jump when you shoot.
Practice at least one crossover, so that you can trick your opponent in order to have more time to shoot.
Think fast on your feet, and don't be intimidated, even if there is a person coming at you.
Visualize yourself making every shot!

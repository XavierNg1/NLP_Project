Write your homework assignments and test dates in a planner.
Pay attention in class.
Do your class work and worksheets every day as soon as they are assigned.
It feels great to come home from a long day at school, but if you want to have time to do any other special activities, begin your homework immediately instead of playing Wii, listening to your MP3 player, or chatting online when you come back from school.
Always get your parents to sign something, like permission slips for a special event for school, field trips, school parties, etc immediately.
Study every day!,
Work on school projects or any projects that can relate to an event, for example, a science fair as soon as possible.
Do not wait until the very last day to start assignment.
Don't overbook yourself.
Avoid studying all over the place.

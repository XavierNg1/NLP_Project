Peel away the papery white outer layer that covers the bulb.
Cut a little off the top of the cloves so that you can see down into each clove.
Cut the top (pointed end/stalk) off the head of garlic.
Place the head of garlic on a piece of foil large enough to wrap the garlic in.
Drizzle or brush a little olive oil over the garlic head.
Wrap the garlic head well with the foil.
Bake in a preheated oven at 350ºF/175ºC until the garlic is soft.
Remove the roasted garlic from the oven and simply pop the individual cloves out of the roasted paper outers.

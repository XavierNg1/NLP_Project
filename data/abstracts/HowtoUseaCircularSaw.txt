Understand the different types and sizes of circular saws and their purposes.
Look at the features of the saw you are planning to use.
Learn the basic types and uses for circular saw blades.
Support the material you are going to cut so that the blade will not react with anything underneath the cut as it is made.
Mark the lumber you are going to cut to length, using a measuring tape, scaled rule, or stick rule, then use a square (either a steel square, tri-square, or angle square) to mark the path of the blade travel for the length of your cut.








,
Set the saw for the proper depth of cut.
Keep your saw guard in smooth running condition.
Look down the face of the right hand side of the blade and line it up to the pencil mark when beginning your cut.








,
Look at the front of the saw to the two guide notches.
Start cutting, after a quick check to the front of the blade.
Keep an eye on the saw base as you are into the cut.
Push the saw into the material with enough force to keep the blade cutting, but avoid pushing so hard the motor speed seems to decrease, or binding occurs on the blade.
Be sure the lower blade guard returns to its position when you exit the cut.

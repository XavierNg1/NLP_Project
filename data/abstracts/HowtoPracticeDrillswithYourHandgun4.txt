Glock and other Constant Double Action (DAO) pistols (such as QA Walthers, LEM, and DKA triggers) have a trigger which has a reset-point after the gun has been fired.
Most other pistols (single-action—SA, double-action—DA, double/single-action—DA/SA) are a bit more standard.
After you have your trigger pull down.
The process of the gun when you fire a bullet is such: bullet is fired, slide racks back, shell ejected, as the slide moves forward the rest of the gun (frame, barrel, etc.),
If you pull the trigger before the gun is at rest in your hands you will shoot higher than the first bullet.
With some practice you will find you can do 10–12 inch (25.4–30.5 cm) groupings at 7 yards (6.4 m).

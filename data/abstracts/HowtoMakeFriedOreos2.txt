Combine pancake mix, eggs, milk, and vegetable oil in a large bowl and whisk until smooth.
Dip an Oreo in the pancake batter using tongs or your hands, coating it entirely with batter.The cookie shouldn't sit in batter too long or it will get soggy, so only dip one at a time and then put it straight in the oil.

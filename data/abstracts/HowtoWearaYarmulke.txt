Pick out a yarmulke that you are comfortable wearing.
Wear the yarmulke at all times.Most importantly, wear the yarmulke on Shabbat, when in a synagogue, or at any Jewish religious ceremony or service.
Place it on your head at the appropriate times, whenever anyone else is wearing one.
Remember a Yarmulke is considered a barrier, however, the object itself is not considered to contain any physical religious value, so don't worry if you drop it.

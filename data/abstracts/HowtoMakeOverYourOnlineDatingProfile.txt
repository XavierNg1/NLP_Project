You've got the account, now what?,
Try an online dating profile makeover.
First mission on giving you an online dating profile makeover is to talk about the pictures.
Do not use pictures of you with your friends, or you at a party.
First go to a tanning salon and a spa.
Now if you do not have a digital camera, do not worry.
Ok, now what you want is a decent head shot .
The next thing you want to do is describe yourself accurately and honestly.
Lastly, if you have a problem on any dating site with a member, and you feel uncomfortable with any communication, please remember to let the webmaster or owner of the online dating site know so that something may be done to keep your online dating experience a safe and successful one.

Be sure that it is appropriate for you to go ahead and act as photographer at a funeral.
Clarify the purpose of your funeral photography mission.
Dress appropriately.
Never forget why you are at the funeral.
Keep your distance and stay invisible.
Capture parts of the funeral that are not focused wholly or even partially on the mourners themselves.
Be patient about the return of the photos to the family.

Pick your game!,
Distinguish reality from imagination.
Be prepared to be scared.
Never play late at night or in the dark.
Be aware of game cliches.
Make fun of the monsters and force yourself to laugh at the characters.
Reduce the game audio.
Listen to music that makes you relax once you turn off the game audio.
Play when someone else is in the room.
Keep in mind that a horror game is only as scary as you want it to be.

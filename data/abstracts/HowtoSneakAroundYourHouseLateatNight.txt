Never giggle or laugh!,
Wear wooly bed socks.
Never rush if you think you hear a sound.
Try absolutely hard to be silent.

,
Know what you want.
Try doing a challenge.
Make a special signal for your friends.
Try to memorize every single crook and bend in your house until you can walk around with your eyes closed if at all possible.

,
Make a map of your house.
Try to accustom your eyes to seeing in the dark.

,
If you have to use a flashlight, put a sock over the light so that the light is not as bright.

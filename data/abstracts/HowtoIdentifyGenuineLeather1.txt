Be wary of any product that doesn't specifically claim to be real leather.
Check the surface grain, the little "pebbles" and pores, for imperfections and uniqueness that signal genuine leather.
Press into the leather, looking for creases and wrinkles.
Smell the leather, searching for a natural, musty smell instead of plastic-like or chemical-y.
Use the fire test, recognizing that it will likely ruin part of the good.
Note the edges, as real leather has rough edges where faux has even, perfect edges.
Bend the leather, looking for it to change color slightly in real leather.
Drop a small amount of water on the good, as real leather absorbs moisture.
Know that real leather goods are rarely ever cheap.
Ignore color, as even colored leathers can be genuine.

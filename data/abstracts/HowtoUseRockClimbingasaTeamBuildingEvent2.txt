Begin your day in a conference room setting, whether it is at the office or in a private office at the rock climbing gym.
Ask the employees to pair up.
Institute new challenges, such as sending and receiving messages, where employees must tell another employee how to get to a new place, or climbers can be tethered together or race.
Take pictures, cheer and encourage laughter.

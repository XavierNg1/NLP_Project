Find a shoe that you'd like the pattern to be made for.
Use the scotch tape to attach the cloth to the back of the shoe and draw a vertical line indicating where the pattern will end.

,
Do the same to the front.
Do the same for the bottom of the shoe.
Decide where you want the buttons to go.
Trace the pattern directly onto the pattern paper.
Cut the same cloth in half and trace the two pieces onto another section of tracing/pattern paper.
Add this half-inch to the pattern paper where the original pattern was traced.

,
Add an inch and a half to the original pattern to create leeway where the button seam is.

,
The pattern is ready to be cut out after one final adjustment.
Cut the pattern along the outlines and include the seam allowance.

,
Fold the pattern along the button and button hole line.

,
Cut off the excess along the bottom of the seam allowance.

,
The leather is ready to be traced and cut out based on the patterns.
Cut the leather using your scissors.
All three pieces should now be sewn together.

,
Take the front seam and back seam (both of which are curved) and make small cuts to make the seam lie flat.
Rub some of the rubber cement onto the corner of the index card.
Wait until both sides of the seam are sticky and semi-dry then push the sides down using your fingers in the middle of the seam so that it lies flat.

,
Use a small roller to press the seams down and make sure that the bond is especially strong (optional).

,
Rub some of the rubber cement along the edges of the spat and then fold it on itself to create a reinforced area for the buttons.

,
Fold the seam onto itself one inch.
Find the center of the seam and make a mark with the pen.
Make a button hole.
After making the button holes, poke through the holes with a pen to mark the spot that the button will be attached to.
Attach the buckle as the last step, or a piece of elastic if you'd like.

Create a one inch grid on either large paper or newsprint.
Draw a vertical line along the right side of your grid paper.
Divide your bust measurement by 2.
Draw a horizontal line connecting from the top edge of your vertical line.
The next point (let's call this point "X") on your pattern will take into account your bra cup size and over all circumference.
Transfer the distance down from the last step over to the left end of your horizontal line.
Divide the distance between the front vertical line and the point X into half.
Connect X, Y and Z.
Divide your waist measurement in half.
Bring down the line from point X above until in touches the bottom waistline.
Draw a line from Y down to M. This is your back seam line.

,
From point N, move up the grid an inch and a half.
Draw a curve up from M through O back to the bottom of your right hand vertical line.

Done.

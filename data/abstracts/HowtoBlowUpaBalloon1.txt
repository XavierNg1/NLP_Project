Loosen the balloon by stretching it in all directions.
Pinch the neck of the balloon with your index finger and thumb just bellow the lip of the neck.
Take a deep breath.
Blow air from your lungs into the balloon.
Watch as the balloon initially resists.
Hold the balloon if you take a break.
Stop before the balloon risks popping.
Tie off.
Finished.

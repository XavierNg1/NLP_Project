Bring your dejection, your mourning, the ashes of your life and put it upon the table.
Get to work on this trade by taking charge of your thoughts.
Acknowledge God's existence, His authority, His ownership of all things -- including yourself, His involvement in your life, and His ability to affect the outcome of your life and circumstances.
Come with thanksgiving.

Separate your Christmas candies into bowls.
Place an aluminum pie tin upside down in front of you.








,
Combine the egg whites and lemon juice in a large bowl to make royal icing.
Place large spoonfuls of the royal icing into quart-size zipped style freezer bags.
Seal the bags.








,
Use scissors to snip 1/4" (6 mm) off one corner of the icing filled bag.
Count out six whole, uncracked, unseparated, unbroken crackers.
Cut the two remaining cracker sheets to form end gable pieces.
Repeat for the second gable end.








,
Squeeze icing along the edges of a gable end and 1 whole graham cracker.








,
Place the long edge of the wall cracker vertical to the base edge of the gable end cracker.
Add the other gable end and wall in the same manner.
Add the roof crackers in the same manner as the wall crackers, but pipe the icing on the flat of the roof, not on the edges.
Line the roof with icing where you want to add shingles.








,
Add the shingles using your chosen candies.
Use your imagination and decorate the entire house whatever way you like.

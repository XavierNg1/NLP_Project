Cut the steel to size.
Gather all your equipment.Load the wire into the machine by following the proper instructions that came with your machine.
Put on all of your safety gear.
Connect the grounding clamp to the workpiece.Clamp the workpieces together with C-clamps, locking pliers or magnetic squares.If you are on a MIG welder, change the cables from DCEN to DCEP.Squeeze the wire feed trigger until the wire pokes out about 13mm from the tip.Set the current and wire feed according to a weld chart.
Tap the wire to the steel and quickly pull back, striking an arc.Move at the right speed for the steel, this will take some testing on your part.Unplug the welder, but keep your safety equipment on.
Using a slag chipping hammer, chip all of the slag off of the weld.Brush the weld with a nylon wire brush to get the little bits of slag out.
Inspect the weld.If you like, you can paint the finished weld once it is cleaned.
Before you weld on anything structural, test your welding technique.
Keep welding more scrap steel if your welds failed the test described above.

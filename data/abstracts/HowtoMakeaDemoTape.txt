Lay out exactly what you want and how you want it.
Create a bio.The bio is what briefly introduces you to the reader and should tell him what he needs to know but also doesn't go too in depth; they'll be left wanting to know more.
Have good songs for it.
Arrange the tracks so there is variety.
Get a box put your demo CD and your bio in it (make it neat) seal it, put the address on, ship it away and hope for the best response.

Take the analogue clock and stop it when the seconds pointer is directly at 0 seconds, which would make it point to 12.
With the Time and Date Properties open, change the time on the physical clock to a minute after the current time.
Wait until the real time is the same as the time set on the stopped clock.
Repeat.

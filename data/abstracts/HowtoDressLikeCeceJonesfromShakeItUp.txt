Next time you're out shopping, try to buy some funky and colorful clothes.
Now onto the fun stuff!,
Sometimes CeCe's closet is made of crop tops and shorter shirts!,
Jeans, jeans, and more jeans!,
Stylish hats, suspenders, big purses...all super CeCe, but these are pretty extreme fashions that may not be so suitable for you.
CeCe has extremely gorgeous shoes, such as black and brown leather booties with slight heels and sequined sneakers.
Necklaces that have several layers of chains are really nice, especially the metallic kind.
Stay comfortable when shopping for clothes and try creating your own fun, unique style instead of copying too much!

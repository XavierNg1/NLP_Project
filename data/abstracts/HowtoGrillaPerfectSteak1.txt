Choose the right type of grill for your meal.
Purchase bright red, freshly cut steaks from your local butcher.
Let the steak sit, covered, at room temperature for 5-10 minutes before cooking.
Rub the steak with salt and pepper, massaging it gently into the meat.
Pre-heat the grill on medium-high heat.

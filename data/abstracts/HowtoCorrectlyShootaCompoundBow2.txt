Hold your bow at a right angle from the floor, pointing towards your target.
Draw the bow straight back, using your extended arm as a guide.
With the bow pulled all the way back, find your personal anchor point -- the place where you have the bow drawn fully back against your cheek.
Form a second anchor point with the tip of your nose on the string.
Align the pin on your sight with the center of your target, then make any final aiming adjustments.
Release the trigger by slowly laying your finger down, not pulling.

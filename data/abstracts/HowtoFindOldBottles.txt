Find a section of river edge that is near a populated area, preferably one that has been inhabited for some number of years.
Decide on a stretch in which to search.
Begin slowly walking in a straight line along the edge of the water, scanning back and forth in front of you as you go.
When you find glass carefully, pull it out of the sand (if it is covered) with one or two fingers.
More often than not, the bottle will be without a cap and full of dirt.

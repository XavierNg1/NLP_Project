Walk up to the dog's owner and ask them if the dog is friendly and get their permission before petting their dog.
Approach the dog slowly but not as though you are fearful.
Hold out your hand slowly.
It is best not to look hard into the dog's eyes or to stare at it as this is a threat to any dog.

,
Ask the dog's name and after it has sniffed your hand and has accepted you, then gently touch the back or chest; but not the top of the head, as most dogs find this intimidating.
Keep the meeting short.

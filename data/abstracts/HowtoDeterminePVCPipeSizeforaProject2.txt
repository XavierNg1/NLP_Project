Schedule 20 pipes (also called DWVs) are the least rigid PVC pipes.
1/2 inch (1.27 cm) plumbing grade PVC pipes are also extremely flexible, but they lack strength and can kink when bent.
3/4 inch (1.91 cm) plumbing grade PVC pipes are very bendable and ideal for any project that requires flexibility, like green houses, pet agility hoops or other curved frames.

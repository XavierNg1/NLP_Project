Recognize poison ivy.
Treat poison ivy as a native plant of great wildlife value.
Consider pulling the plants out.
Keep your distance when pulling out the plants.
Be aware that the roots contain rash-causing oils too.
Wear long pants, long sleeve shirt or get a slicker set that would be worn only for poison ivy work.
Put down large pieces of cardboard.
Overlap with plastic past the cardboard.
Dump deep soils or light rocks to hold covers down.
Wash all clothing, gloves and shoes isolated from other items three times.
Wash up with Tecnu Extreme.
Opt to use an herbicide to kill the plants.
On a day that is not windy or about to rain, spray thoroughly, to coat all poison ivy leaves with the solution.
Wearing gloves, as the roots can also produce poison ivy's characteristic effect, dig down into the soil at least 8 inches (20.3 cm) and remove all of the roots.
Smother the area where the poison ivy was growing.
Check the area several times a year and take steps to kill the poison ivy.
Be absolutely vigilant as to which part of clothing the plant touches on you, such as your pants, gloves, etc.
Wait to use soap and water until after cleansing with rubbing alcohol, vinegar, mineral spirits or commercial cleanser.

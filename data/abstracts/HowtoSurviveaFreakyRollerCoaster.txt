DO NOT go on alone.
Get in line.
Talk to your friend about how fun the ride will be.
Pick the best seat for you.
Strap yourself in as fast as possible.
Do not panic.
Don't prepare yourself and hold your breath whilst it goes up, or when waiting, just relax and keep your breaths even.

,
Hold on tight!,
It's over.

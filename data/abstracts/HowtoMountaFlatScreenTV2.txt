Find the studs in your wall.
Using a level, mark your studs with pencil marks.
Drill pilot holes into them according to the drill pattern on your bracket back.
Place your mounting bracket on the wall, lined up with the studs and the pilot holes you just drilled.
Hold the mounting bracket on the wall and screw the largest bolts into the pilot holes.
Pick up your TV and hang it on the bracket.
Make sure that the bracket is sturdy and can hold the weight of the TV before you fully let go.
Finished!

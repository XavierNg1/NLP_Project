Figure out a plan to allow the relative to learn about the child's bedwetting, though keeping it discreet enough for the child to not feel embarrassed when talked about.
Take the bedwetting child's feelings into consideration.
Have the relatives kids sleep in the same room as your children, if they decide to come over.
Determine the closeness between the child who bedwets and the relative who needs to know that he/she does.

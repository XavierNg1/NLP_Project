Simmer half a gallon of milk over medium heat.
Add a 1/4 cup of lemon juice once the milk is steamy and frothy.
Remove the mixture from heat, stir, and let it all sit for 10 minutes.
Place some cheesecloth in a mesh strainer, then use it to strain the liquids out of your milk mixture.
Keeping the cheesecloth wrapped around the curds, press the whole bunch into a rough square.
Place a flat cutting board or plate on the curds, weigh it down, and wait one hour.
Fry the edges of the paneer in hot oil until golden brown for a richer taste.

Decide what pet you would like and which pet you would like to trade.
Find out if your dream pet is a reasonable trade with the pet you wish to trade.
Advertise your trade on the Pound Board.
Do not take the first offer - unless it's exactly what you are looking for!,
If you are having problems finding a suitable trade you may want to go through the first steps again.
If you are still having problems then perhaps put a note in your siggy (useful if you post on the boards a lot) or your lookup saying that your pet is up for trade and what you are looking for.

When you find a trade you like you must use the user-to-user transfer system in the pound.

Confirm that you are not removing the patina from an expensive antique.
Before you begin always read and understand instructions on all labels of the chemicals and solvents you are using and always work in a well-ventilated area.
Wash vs.
Strip/Paint Remover: Always use rubber gloves and a mask when using stripper.
Donâ€™t remove any stripper until you can rub with one finger (without scraping) down to bare wood.
Removing the Stripper: Periodically peek under the plastic to determine how quickly the stripper is working.
Wash: When the stripper has softened the finish, scrape off as much as possible, so you can wash down the piece with the appropriate solvent or water.
Sand/Sandpaper: To remove light scratches, which is all you should do, use fine grit sandpaper.
Stain: Your best bet is to purchase the leading brand of pigmented wiping stain, which are color fast, direct-to-wood stains formulated to develop and highlight the grain of all wood species.
Remember to place all used rags in an approved airtight container.
Finish: Now your piece is ready for the finish.

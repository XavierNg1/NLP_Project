Familiarize yourself with emergency evacuation procedures in the hotel.
Return to the hotel desk and ask for another room if you don't feel comfortable in the one you've been assigned.
Keep the door closed and locked when you're inside.
Store your valuables in the hotel room safe or the main hotel safe.
Leave the television or radio on when you leave, so it sounds like someone is still there.
Ask the front desk not to give out your name or room number if anybody inquires.

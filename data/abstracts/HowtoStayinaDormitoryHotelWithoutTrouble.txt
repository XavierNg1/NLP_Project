Pick the right hotel/hostel for your purpose/destination.
Check out the hostel's web page, if there is one.
Book a bed in advance (at least one night, even you plan to move around and find a better one), especially if you are going to arrive at night.
Do not hesitate to call them before you book.
Listen carefully about regulations when you check in.
When you enter the room, smile and say 'Hi' to all of the roommates if they are inside, but skip this at night if the room is dark.
Have a small chitchat if your roommates are in a friendly mood.
Do not leave things you would regret if you lose: sadly, some people do not feel guilty about stealing others' properties.
Realize that some people snore or sleep talk.
If other roommates are extremely noisy on purpose at night, go to the front desk and talk to the staff.

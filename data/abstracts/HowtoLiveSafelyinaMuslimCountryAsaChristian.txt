Be glad that some Muslims are tolerant people who want to live peacefully and provide for their families, and you may be able to live among such people safely, while avoiding areas with intolerant people.
Realize that there is a fraction of less open minded Muslims that will be less tolerant and thus will often verbally or physically attack members of other religions.
Remaining in or moving into a Muslim country safely will call for consideration of your surroundings.
Avoid provocations.
Work for safety together with Christians and other persecuted religious and other good (non-radicalized) people, such as Jews, plus reasonably moderate artists and gays who are not really out.
Write and speak about your experiences, and let the world know of them.

Blend in by appearances; you don't have to go against your faith to do so.
Give and similar things will be given to you.
If you bring your dog, be extremely careful.
Islam includes fairness, as Islam is indeed very close to Christianity, and in fact Christians and Jews may be treated in a special way as they are called "The people of the book" and follow very closely some teachings of Islam.

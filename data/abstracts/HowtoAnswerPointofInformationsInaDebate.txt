Plan on when to accept POIs during your argument.
Acknowledge your opponent when they raise a POI.
Finish your sentence or thought before addressing the opponent’s POI.
Decline the POI if you believe a disruption will undermine the effectiveness of your argument.
Accept the POI by saying “Accepted,” “Yes, please,” or “Go ahead.”After you accept the POI, your opponent typically has no more than 15 seconds to raise their objection or question.
Answer the POI.
Keep your response within the scope of your original argument.
Question the credibility of the POI’s facts.
Anticipate your opponent’s counterargument.
Remain confident even if you don’t know how to respond to a POI.
Address the audience and judges.
Do not walk towards your opponent as they deliver their POI.
Respond to the POI concisely.
Make a note of where you are in your speech when you accept a POI.
Transition from the POI to your argument smoothly.

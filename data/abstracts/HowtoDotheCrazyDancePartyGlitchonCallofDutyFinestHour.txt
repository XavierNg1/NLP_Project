Go on the second mission of the Western Front (aka the Americans).
Get through almost the entire level but don't go into the room that finishes the level or else you won't be able to do this glitch.
Where the big hole is in the wall that ends the mission, stand directly in front of it and walk backwards and look to your left side.
After the boards have blown up, go into the pathway and you'll hear music.

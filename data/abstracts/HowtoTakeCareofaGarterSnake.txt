Get an aquarium.
Layer the bottom of the aquarium with substrate.
Add a hide away.
Have some things for the snake to climb upon.
For the benefit of the snake when you first bring it home, put a cover, or a large towel (not a thick one, or it will run out of oxygen) around or over the tank.
Buy a thermometer.
Get some heat.
Ensure that the humidity is accurate.
Get a water bowl.
Change the water weekly, if not more often.
Feed the snake.
When feeding it, do not sling the snake's food at it.
If you choose to feed the snake food that is alive, (food that it hunts and kills), create hiding spots.
Clean the cage regularly.
To clean the cage, hose it down with a few squeezes of mild soap and scrub it with a sponge or rag, then rinse twice.
Don't give the garter too much room, as they will become nervous and stressed.
Handle with care.

Caress the sides of her face with your hands while you're kissing.
Caress her ears.
Caress her neck.
Stroke her hair.
Stroke her lips.
Caress her hands.
Caress her shoulders.
Caress her knee.
Caress her upper thigh.
Caress her back and shoulders from behind.
Caress the bend of her waist.
Caress the small of her back while you're hugging.
Stroke the inside of her wrist.
Gently run your hand along her spine.
Caress her feet.
Caress her navel.

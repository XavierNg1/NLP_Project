Be doubtful of any new Air Jordans that are sold for under $100.
Make sure the shoes are labeled “100% Authentic.” If you’re looking at a pair online that are listed just as “Authentic” you should be suspicious.Don’t buy Air Jordan shoes that are advertised as “custom,” “sample,” or “variant.” This indicates that Nike did not commission them.
Confirm that the shoes come with the right box.
Avoid online purchases unless the images are clear and detailed.
Avoid buying Air Jordans from an overseas seller.
Check seller feedback on sites like eBay.

Know that almost all of the following steps can be substituted with other ingredients to your hearts content.
Chop up your fresh fruit -- strawberries, raspberries, and/or blueberries, for the classic -- into bite-sized pieces.
Cut your cake into flat strips or squares.
Brush your ladyfingers or thin slices of cake with the sherry or flavored liquor of your choice.
Coat the tops of the cake with your jelly or jam.
In a large, tall glass bowl, layer the bottom with a third of your cakes.
Pour and spread a third of your fruit on top of the cakes.
Add a third of the custard and spread evenly over the fruit.
Top the custard with a thin layer of whipped cream.
Continue layering -- cake, fruit, custard, then cream -- until you reach the top of the bowl.
Consider topping it with more fruit, crumbled cookies, or a spring of fresh mint.

Know what worship actually is.
Reverence to holy persons play an important role in ALL religions.
When Protestants call Mary a sinner, point out to them that she is called "full of grace" by the angel in Luke chapter 1.
When they argue against Mary's assumption into Heaven, remind them that both the prophets Elijah and Enoch were both assumed into Heaven too.
When Protestants claim that the various appearances of Mary in various parts of the world (eg: Lourdes, Fatima, etc) are really tricks of the Devil, remind them that both Elijah and Moses appeared at the Transfiguration.
Protestants quote Jeremiah chapter 7, verse 13, when he decries the children of Israel worshipping the moon as "the Queen of Heaven," and claim that when we call Mary "the Queen of Heaven," it is the same thing.
Protestants will quote St. Luke chapter 11, where Christ tells a woman "Blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it," after she cries out "blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that you nursed.",
Protestants think that Mary and St. Joseph had other children besides Our Lord.
Devotion to Mary and the saints go back to the earliest times of the Christian Church's history.

Do not yell.
Do not talk too quietly, either.
Make gentle hand movements while talking.
Take into consideration how your audience (or those you are talking to) react to your words.
Be careful with your word choice.
Be eager and sincere.
Listen.
Smile, laugh, joke.
Never use monosyllabic answers unless appropriate.
Never cut the conversation midway.
Timing is everything.

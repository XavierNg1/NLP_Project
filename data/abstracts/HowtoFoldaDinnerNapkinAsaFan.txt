Unfold your dinner napkin.
Fold it in half lengthwise with the "right" side out.

,
Lay it out on the table before you with a short end lined up with the table edge.

,
Pleat it, starting at the short edge.
Pick up the napkin, holding the pleats in place, and fold it lengthwise with the pleats on the outside.
Only concentrate on the unpleated part of the napkin from here.
Let go of the pleats while holding the triangular end of the napkin.

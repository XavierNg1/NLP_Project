Think about the last time you took a bath, for yourself to languish in and soak away the stresses of the day.
Make time for yourself to relax.
Make a bath special.
Immerse yourself in the tub and let all your stresses wash down the overflow with the displaced water.

,
Relax.
Try to take a shower before so you are clean before and you're not just soaking in your own filth for a long time.

,Make a playlist of relaxing songs to enjoy while in the bath

,
A face mask and a good book are also essentials for a good bath.
Enjoy!

Understand the difference between a knock-off and a genuine bag.
Be store wise.
Be realistic about the price.
Ask the vendor if the bag is real, a copy, or a fake.
Know the signs of a fake or knockoff bag.
Check the hardware, if it does not look like authentic hardware, feels light, has rough edges, ect.
Check the zipper manufacturer, usually the underside of the zipper will have a logo.
Don't confuse a designer bag with making a purchase of value.

Get some ferret nail clippers.
Either have lots of treats so you can trim them or some Ferretone to put on their bellies while you trim them.
Before you begin cutting, scruff your ferret and look at their nails.
Start with the front paws and work your way to the back.
Be very careful!,
If you do slip and the ferret starts bleeding, have some baking soda in a little bowl.
Once you are done give your ferret a big hug and some water.

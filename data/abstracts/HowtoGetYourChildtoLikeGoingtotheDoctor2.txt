Tell them what to expect.The most common source of a child's anxiety about going to a check-up or appointment is not knowing what will happen to them.
Explain the purpose of the visit.
Have your child ask questions.
Address guilty feelings.Sometimes if a child has a serious medical condition, the effort to get them to the doctor, and the disruption this might cause in the family routine, is something they will noticeâ€”even if they don't always have the vocabulary to explain what they see happening.
Take them along to your own medical appointments.Where appropriate, one fast way to get your child more used to the idea of going to the doctor's office is by taking them along when you go for a check-up or non-stressful appointment.

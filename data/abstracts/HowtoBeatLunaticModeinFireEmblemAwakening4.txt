Use DLC if necessary.
EXPontential Growth features a bunch of Entombed who will run for the exit on the other side of the map, and won't ever attack you.
The last DLC map in the bundle is Infinite Regalia.
You can also check out the Bonus Box in the Wireless feature on the menu when you're in the World Map once it's been unlocked.

Buy a plot of land in Florida.
Always use a Title company to purchase, especially their escrow account.
In order to complete the purchase, you will need to sign a contract that is then countersigned by the seller.
Once the title deed has been transferred, the purchase is complete.
If you want to hold onto the land as an investment, there are little maintenance expenses.
If you decide to build on the plot, as well as the cost of the building project itself, you may incur other costs such as impact fees; a fee that goes towards the local community, funding services such as local schools and fire service.

Be aware of a usually colorless gas that smells like mustard, garlic, or onions--but note it doesn't always have an odor.
Move from the area from where it was released onto higher ground, as mustard gas is heavier than air.
Remove all clothing that may have been exposed to the gas, being sure not to let the clothes touch your face or head.
Rinse any exposed parts of your body with plain water.
Call emergency services and wait for help to arrive.

Shuffle before dealing the cards.
After shuffling twice "strip" the deck.
Cut the deck onto the 'cut card' and get ready to deal.








,
After the blinds are posted, deal each player two cards face down.
Note: There will be four betting rounds.
Round 1 (Preflop): Betting starts with the player clockwise of the Big Blind.
Round 2 (The Flop): The dealer takes the top card from the deck and "burns" it, face down, under the pot.
Round 3 (The Turn): The dealer once again burns a card and places another card face up on the table.
Round 4 (The River): The dealer burns a card again and places the fifth and final card face up on the table.
The Showdown: After betting/checking on the river, any players left in the pot have to either show their hands or fold them.
Whoever has the best hand wins the pot.

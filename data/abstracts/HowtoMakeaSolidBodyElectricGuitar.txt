Create (or find on the internet) a technical drawing and make a parts list.
Print/draw a full scale model of the drawing.
Get your wood.
Layout your scaled drawing onto a piece of ply-wood NOT your guitar body wood.
Use a drill press and file to do the body cavity and pickup holes (NOT the neck pocket though) and use a jig/scroll saw or a band saw to cut the outside.
Once you are satisfied with the plywood pattern, use double sided tape (carpeting tape from any home store works great) to attach the pattern to your body wood blank.

,
Use a table router with a pattern bit or a laminate trimming bit to route the outside.
Use a hand router with a pattern cutting bit to route out the pickup and body cavities.
Trace the heel of the neck onto a separate piece of plywood and use a jigsaw/band saw and a miter gauge as well as a rounded file to make the neck pocket pattern.
Use a Surform planer to carve to contour of the back and arm if desired (some people say that a spokeshave also works well but I didn't have much luck with it).

,
Sand the entire body with 100-150 grit sandpaper (orbital or palm sanders work fine) followed by 200 and 250-300 grit paper and a final wet sanding of 350 grit by hand.

,
This will give you the basic body shape that you want for a guitar.

Let's start with your character's weight.
Never be any taller than 5'6.
Don't forget curves.
You skin should be naturally perfect.
Logic is for losers.
All flaws should be minor and used to make your character look adorable (therefore not making them actual, serious flaws that your character must learn to confront and live with).
Having more than four species in your bloodline is highly encouraged.
Your talents defy logic.
You don't need to spend time mastering anything.
Depth is another thing you can ignore.
Even if you are in a modern role play always use a sword as a weapon.
France, England, and Japan: the ONLY countries you should come from, even if your character is a wolf-unicorn-fairy hybrid living in Narnia.

Decide if you're the sort of person who likes thrift store shopping.
Decide what time is best for you to go.
Try shopping with a friend who you trust so won't you get frustrated with the time you will be taking.
Enter the store of your choice.
The second way is that you have no idea what you're looking for, as long as it fits, is gorgeous and is a total bargain.
Many thrift stores color code their clothes.
Color and texture should leap out at you just by running your eyes over the top or sides of the clothing racks.
Just pull out the clothes that appeal by color and texture, so that you can check for style.
Be honest with yourself even before trying on the item.
Check closely for stains, tears, mended parts, stretched stitching (often hard to repair) and marks.
If the item is quality but it suffers from issues such as stains or being too large or slightly outdated, then still consider it.
Time to try on your clothes.
Always look in a mirror to see if the clothes really do suit you.
If you still have energy left, look around some more.
Buy your clothes.
Wash your clothes.
Enjoy your creativity, thriftiness, and making the world a better place by donating money and items.

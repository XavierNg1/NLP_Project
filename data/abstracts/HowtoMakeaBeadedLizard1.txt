Cut a roughly three-foot length of 1/8th-inch ribbon or string.
Fold the string in half so that the two ends meet.
Take the loop and run it through the bottom of a keychain clasp.
Pull the ends through the loop to create a slipknot.
Tape the clasp down to the table so that the strings drape towards you.

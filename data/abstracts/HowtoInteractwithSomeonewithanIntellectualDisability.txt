Walk up to them with a warm, friendly countenance and introduce yourself.
When trying to establish a connection, see if you have anything in common with them, and if they would like to share that interest with you.
If they are having trouble at work, know your boundaries.
If you invite them to any events, let them know that they are welcome to bring their caretaker or family member or friend with them.
If they make a mistake, don't laugh at them.
Allow them to handle themselves.
Always be mindful and give the disabled person patience.

Rely on the power of replacing negative thoughts with positive ones.
Accept and embrace the clich√© that failure is a stepping stone to success.
Practice patience.
Treat the messed up, overturned karmic experience as a lesson that goes beyond the moment and reveals our character.
Take strength from bad karma happenings.
Stay unruffled and turn away from thoughts of revenge.
Love your enemy.
Meditate.

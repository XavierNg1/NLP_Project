Take your laces out.
Get all of that dirt and dried cider/ale off your boots.
Start to put the polish on.
Keep re-applying the polish to the cloth and keep polishing until your whole boot is done.
Leave the boots for around 20 minutes for the leather to absorb the polish.
Take the polish off and shine them.
Tie a knot in one end of the lace and cut the plastic bit off.
Put the plastic end of the lace up through the inside of your bottom eyelet.
Put the lace through the other bottom eyelet going from the outside, in.

,
Pull the lace diagonally to the next eyelet up on the opposite side of the boot.
Keep repeating until your boots are laced to the top but with one of the top eyelets spare.

,
Wrap the lace around the top of the boot twice, going through the tag/loop at the back.

,
Tuck the lace in through the remaining eyelet, from the outside, in.
Wear the boots!

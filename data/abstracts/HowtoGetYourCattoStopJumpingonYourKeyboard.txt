Watch your cat.

Do not leave your cat with unattended opportunities to find your keyboard.
Consider creating a barricade that either stops your cat from getting onto your desk area or that stops your cat from reaching the keyboard zone.
Make jerky arm movements while typing.
Distract your cat.
Create a comfort zone for your cat situated near the workspace but not anywhere near your keyboard.
Deter her quickly.
Use keyboard leaps as a reason to take a break.
Consider purchasing a computer stand.

Measure your head using a tape measure.

The pattern on the right will be your base pattern.
Trace the pattern on your fur (on the non-furry side) with your sewing marking pen.

Sew two pieces together by folding the insides together.
Sew one side of the piece to the other piece, again, insides folded together.



 Now it's time to attach some ears.

Sew them onto the base: I'll admit that this is the small flaw with my method of wig making.
How to make a multi-colored wig, such as Munkustrap or Alonzo: This is essentially the same method, except you cut the base pattern into quarters.
Extras: Grizabella: Buy a curly wig either online or (if you live in the U.S.) go to Party City and buy a "Yo Mama" wig and stretch out the curls.
Extras: Old Deuteronomy: Make a brown wig and buy a costume beard of the same color.
Extras: Cassandra/Coricopat/Tantomile: If you wish to make a wig for these characters in keeping with the style of your faux fur wigs, go to the fabric store and buy some short faux fur (similar to the fabric on the right).

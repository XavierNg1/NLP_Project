Bend down to their height and look them in the eye.
Say, "If you again, you are going to go in timeout/the corner/the chair/the step, etc..." This is the child's warning.
If the child exhibits the same behavior again, pick them up (if light enough) or take their arm and guide them to the place where the time out will take place.
Bend down to their level and make eye contact to them and explain to them that they are going to be taking a timeout now and the reason for it.
Walk away.
Follow through.
Ask for an apology.

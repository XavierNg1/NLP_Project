Choose a sweater that fits you well.
Cut the sleeves off.
Measure around the arm holes.
Cut a strip of ribbed fabric according to that measurement and 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) wide.
Fold the strip in half lengthwise twice to make a double-fold bias strip.
Cut the strip in half widthwise.
Sew the strips into two loops.
Pin the rings to each armhole, sandwiching the raw edges inside.
Topstitch the rings down.
Press the armholes once more.
Draw a V-neck down the front of your sweater.
Cut the V-neck.
Cut a strip of ribbed material long enough to pin along the new neckline.
Fold and press the strip twice to make a double-fold bias tape.
Cut a notch into each end.
Sew the notches together.
Pin the collar to the raw, cut edge of your sweater.
Topstitch the ribbing down.
Done!

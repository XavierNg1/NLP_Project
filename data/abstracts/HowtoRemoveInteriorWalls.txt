First, determine if the wall you want to remove is a load bearing wall, meaning it supports the floor above.
If the wall you want to remove is at a right angle to the floor joists - STOP.
Look at the wall for electrical outlets, switches, etc.
Since demolition will bring up a lot of dust and debris, empty as much from the rooms as possible and cover any doors with plastic sheets to contain dust.
If you are relatively sure the wall is void of any obstructions, don't smash into the wall with your foot or a sledgehammer.
Wearing work gloves, grab onto the edge of the smashed drywall and pull off.
Once all the drywall has been removed, you can start to remove the wall studs.
After all the wall studs are removed, you can remove the floor plate.
Once all the debris is removed, you'll have to patch the ceiling where the wall was removed with a strip of drywall and patch the floor with a new piece of flooring.

,
On the ceiling, measure the width of the hole created by removal of the wall.
The drywall should be cut almost as wide as the new opening (tape and mud will cover any gaps).
Mud the edge of the new drywall and the existing ceiling with drywall compound ('mud").
Allow the mud to dry (check the box/container for drying time required) and sand the drywall mud.

,
Add another layer of mud, using a wider trowel to taper the edges.
You may need to do the above steps several times to obtain an almost seamless match between the patch and the existing ceiling.
Once you are satisfied with the patch, you can add a coat of drywall primer/sealer and repaint the patch to match the existing ceiling.
Depending on the type of flooring, you will need to add a patch to the carpeting, tile or hardwood from the adjoining rooms.

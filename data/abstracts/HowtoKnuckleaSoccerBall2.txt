Practice the hop step without a ball.
Don't worry about power until you can hit the ball without spin.
Keep your body compact, still, and strong.
Slightly turn your foot out for added power, striking with the bone on the inside-top of your foot.
Practice the shot daily, adding challenges as you grow comfortable.

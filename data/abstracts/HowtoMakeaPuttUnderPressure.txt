Make sure you hit the green, preferably on the upslope as close to the hole as possible.
As you approach the green glance at the putt from all angles so you know exactly how the putt will break.
When you get to your ball, mark it and make sure you clean it thoroughly.
Get down behind your ball and take one last glance at the slope of the green.
Clear any debris that may affect your ball from getting knocked off the line.
Relax your shoulders and take a few practice strokes.
When you address the ball, you should know where you're aimed, the last thing you should worry about it the speed.
Stand above the ball with a little bend in your knees, and your eyes should be above the ball and you should be relaxed.
Once you are relaxed, pull the putter back, then make a good stroke on it.
Watch as your ball rolls in the hole.

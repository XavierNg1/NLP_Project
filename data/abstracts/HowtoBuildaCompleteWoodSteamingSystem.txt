The heating element electrical connections must be enclosed in a waterproof box at the end of the "T" area of the santee and have a cord with a grounded plug and wire (green wire) grounded at both ends of the cord.
In addition to the boiler, it is important to have the proper water supply feeding the boiler as water is boiled/steamed away.
Build the supply stand with a ¾” plywood deck on top the stand about 18” square with a 3” hole in the center for the tank connector to pass through.
Having a water supply to feed the system without interrupting the heating and steaming process makes all the difference.
As with most wood steaming systems, the steam box is a big problem.
Use treated lumber or treated plywood covering it with foam/glass insulation.
The steam box stands over the PVC boiler/steamer and water supply tank supported by legs.
This boiler, water supply tank/stand and steam box above, sets on a ¾” plywood platform with a 2x4 frame under it.
Note, never move the steam system when plugged in (in use), keep safety your biggest project!

Don't stay in one place during open long distance gunfights.
When you surprise an enemy from the front and they start spraying at you, be mobile and try to get around them.
Surprisingly, it's actually easier to outrun their spray when you're closer to them.
When your enemy is reloading, shoot, when your enemy is moving and and bursting, you move and shoot at them.
If you're out in the open, you're fair game for snipers and a lot of other things.
When the opposite team starts rolling out the smokes and flashes, make sure you've got a retreat point you can maneuver to when you're blind.
You're less likely to die if you stick together with your team.
Don't be a coward.
Give help to your team-mates.
Know the maps that you play, and know the likely camping and sniping spots.

Be ready for anything.
With an m4a1 without a silencer you can shoot 3 bullets at a time while moving.

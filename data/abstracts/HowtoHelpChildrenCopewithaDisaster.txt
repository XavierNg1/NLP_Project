Take steps to manage your own feelings and plans for coping.
Build and use social support systems of family, friends, community organizations and agencies, faith-based institutions, or other resources.
Understand that a child’s reaction to a disaster is brief and represents normal reactions to “abnormal events.” A smaller number of children can be at risk for more enduring psychological distress as a function of three major risk factors:


Direct exposure to the disaster, such as being evacuated, observing injuries or death of others, or experiencing injury along with fearing one’s life is in danger
Loss/grief: This relates to the death or serious injury of family or friends
On-going stress from the secondary effects of disaster, such as temporarily living elsewhere, loss of friends and social networks, loss of personal property, parental unemployment, and costs incurred during recovery to return the family to pre-disaster life and living conditions.

,
Know that in most cases, depending on the risk factors above, distressing responses are temporary.
Encourage children and adolescents to share their thoughts and feelings about the incident.
Listen to what the child is saying.
Try to understand what is causing anxieties and fears.
Create a reassuring environment for your children.
Talk to a professional if you have followed the steps above and your child continues to exhibit stress, the reactions worsen over time, or if your children cause interference with daily behavior at school, at home, or with other relationships.
Monitor and limit your family’s exposure to the media.

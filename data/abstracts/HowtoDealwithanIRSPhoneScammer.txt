Realize that it's not really the IRS trying to reach you.
If they mention the word "lawsuit", this is also a scam: If you're ever being sued by anyone, you would get served papers from your local sheriff's office and you would never receive a "heads up call" from law enforcement informing you of an impending lawsuit or an imminent arrest.
Never give the caller any personal information.
Listen for phony excuses.
Realize the phone number they're calling from is not the number of the IRS.
Realize the scare tactics the scammers tell you is not under the real IRS's authority: The scammers will often get you to pay up fast by threatening to have you arrested, take away your drivers license (or business license), get you kicked out of the country, etc.
Write down everything you can find out about the caller.
Hold firm in ignoring them.
Do not wire any money.
Hang up as soon as possible.
Warn your friends.

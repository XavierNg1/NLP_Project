ASSAULT OPERATIONS-Assault operations are often linked with an Observation Operation.
The OP (Observation Post) team- The OP team should be inserted as per an Observation Operation.
Before the main assault force arrives, the OP team need to do a series of CTRs (Close Target Recces) to establish these.
The main force -The bulk of the force will infill in a different place to the OP team.
Seaborne- If your target is particularly close to the sea, consider an amphibious landing.
River and lake insertion-


Rivers and lakes are easier to insert from than the sea for several reasons:




Usually gets you closer, if not into, the target area
Is less risky in most cases
Less violent weather systems
More shore cover




As before, approach your target in the twilight and hide your boats in a suitable area.
Execution-


For this example, we will presume that the attacking force is a Detachment of four companies; 3 infantry companies and 1 support company.
Ambush- This is a useful technique to master, as some of your mission briefs will be to disrupt enemy communications and transport.

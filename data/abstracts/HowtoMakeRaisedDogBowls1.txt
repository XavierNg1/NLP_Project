Measure your dog from paw to shoulder, then subtract 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters).
Get a small, simple trashcan to use as a base.
Get a rimmed dog bowl that is the same diameter as the trashcan.
Measure the height and circumference of your trashcan, then add a few inches to each measurement.
Cut a sheet of fabric according to that measurement.
Paint a stripe of Mod Podge down the side of your trashcan, then press the edge of your fabric into it.
Continue gluing the fabric to the trashcan, working only a few inches at a time.
Fold the edge of the fabric under itself, then glue it down.
Wait for the glue to dry before trimming the excess fabric off of the top and bottom edges.
Paint a design onto the front of the can using acrylic paint and a stencil.
Wait for the paint to dry, then give the entire can on final coat of Mod Podge.
Choose some thick rope for the trim.
Hot glue some rope along the top and bottom edges of the can.
Place the bowl on top, and fill it with food or water.

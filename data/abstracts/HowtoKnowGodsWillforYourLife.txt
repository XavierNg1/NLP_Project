Read the Bible.
Pray for 30 minutes, 1 hour daily.
Receive salvation by God's grace through faith in God -- not of works -- lest any should boast.
Worship God in spirit and in truth: if not, you will never get to understand him.
Show love as it's the essence of the Golden rule.
Make blessings for others: "13 But when you give a reception/banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, 14 and 'you will be blessed', since they do not have the means to repay you; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.",
Sing praises and worship Him.
Allow yourself only such a word as is good, uplifting others, according to the need of the moment, so that it will 'give grace to those who hear' -- letting no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth... (Ephesians 4:29).

,
Always acknowledge His presence.
Do it!,
If you lend, "ask it not again", if you are not repaid.
Recognize and bless others.
Spread the good news, the Gospel.

To make the image more vivid, try adding some steel gears.

,
Start this by defining the gradient (multi-stop, greys, with a shade of blue).

,
Apply the gradient to some wheels.
Put the steel gears in the device (just take care to not couple steel gears with gold gears: steel with steel and gold with gold).
Place the axles in the center of the gears and we are set.

,
Add some screws holding the device.
Distribute the screws evenly (or randomly if you feel like it) and it's done!

Don't ever lie to your girlfriend in regards to your female best friend.
Ask your girlfriend to come out with you and your FBF.
When your FBF is around, subtly show your girlfriend some love and support.
Encourage your FBF to talk to your girlfriend, and vice versa.
If your FBF is uncomfortable around your girlfriend, ask her why.
If your FBF upsets your girlfriend, or lies to her about anything regarding your friendship, then let your girlfriend know that you agree that your FBF was in the wrong.
Don't do anything that will hurt your girlfriend.
If your girlfriend asks to see a sample of your conversations/texts with your FBF, let her.
Take your FBF aside and make sure that she knows how important your girlfriend is to you, and that you are in a very loving relationship.

Fix all ER verb tenses in a scene so you can visualise it when you need to call on it from memory.
Associate ER verbs with an image -- EAR is the perfect one!,
Choose a commonly used ER verb.
Use the number shape system to memorise the Je, Tu, Il, Nous, Vous, Ils forms.
Associate the nun with the Je, the shoe with the Tu and so on… Let’s look at that now:


one sounds like nun: Je suis
two sounds like shoe: Tu es
three sounds like tree:Il est
four sounds like door:Nous ons
five sounds like hive:Vous ez
six sounds like sticks:Ils ent

,
Go back to your scene.
Try Tu –You.
Link "Il" with number rhyme 3: tree.
Number 4, door is linked with Nous.
Five is hive and links with vous which reminds you of Pooh as in Winnie the Pooh (the bear, check Google if you are unfamiliar).
Walk past Poo Bear and hear a cracking sound… I realise I am standing on lots of sticks (sounds like 6).
This method is easy.

Decide when to go.
Once you've selected a date, see which events will be going on when you head into town.
Drive to Washington if you live a reasonable distance away, or take the train.
Start the day by eating a quick breakfast and visiting one of the many Smithsonian museums along the National Mall.
Alternatively, for a more historical experience (better for older kids), visit Arlington National Cemetery in nearby Virginia, Mount Vernon, the National Gallery of Art or the Supreme Court building.
Eat lunch at the museum's cafeteria or a nearby restaurant.
Visit a national monument.
Walk over to one of the national memorials.
If time allows, visit another Smithsonian museum or go shopping.
Eat dinner out or pick it up on the way home.
Go home and enjoy the memories and photos of your family day out in Washington, DC!

Choose whichever picture you would like to turn into a template.
Identify what part of the picture is the main outline (too many details can overcrowd the embroidery) and what colors of thread you would like to use for it.
Take a piece of corrugated cardboard and set the paper you want to work the embroidery onto on top of that.
Punch out the outline with a needle or pin.
Take the paper out from between the cardboard and template.

,
Thread the needle with one of the outline colors chosen and begin on one end of a line.
Tie the thread neatly once the line is done.
Continue on until the piece is done.

,
If the picture was done just for display, take the finished product and find a neat sheet protector sleeve, frame, or other holder to display it.

Encounter them: The first step would be to encounter them, as to get them in your Pokedex, or your Pokegear, if you're playing HeartGold or SoulSilver.
Buy Items: The next step would be to get the proper amount of Pokeballs and Potions, because the Dogs and Latis all have a catch rate of 3, meaning your chances of catching them on your first ball are very slim, and they can really damage you, possibly thwarting that attempt at catching them.

,
Get an Eevee: If you want your Dogs and/or Lati to have a specific nature for competitive battling, get an Eevee, as it is crucial.
Get a Ditto: If you're playing competitively, get a Ditto with the nature you want your target to have.

,
Breed: Put your Eevee and Ditto in the daycare for a little while, but before you do, give Ditto the Everstone item.
Train and Evolve the new Eevee: Use it in battles, give it berries, use battle items, and give it the Soothe Bell item, and EV train it in Speed and it's Defense stats, and then evolve your Eevee into an Umbreon.
Get a Mr.
Train it.
Get a Fast False Swiper: Just get a Scyther or Weavile with a Jolly nature, EV train it in Speed and Attack, and teach it the TM False Swipe.
Encounter your target.
Throw out Umbreon the next time you encounter them, throw out your Egg Umbreon, with the desired nature.
Throw Pokeballs!,
Congratulations!

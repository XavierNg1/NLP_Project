We start with a very simple maneuver, but a very viable skill for normal drivers and technical drivers.
The scenario: Driving down the freeway, at night, it is raining so there is reduced traction and visibility on the road.
Solution 1 (no cars around you): You should already know if there are cars near you (read "Stay alert" above).
Solution 2 (cars are around you): This situation is much more tricky.
If the object were a bit further away, the best decision would probably be to use your brakes for a short period of time, release them most of the way (all the way, and the transfer of weight off your front tires may cause your vehicle to become unstable when you try to swerve, or just under-steer), then swerve.

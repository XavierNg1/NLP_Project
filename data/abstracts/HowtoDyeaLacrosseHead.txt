Plan out the stick design first.
Prepare the stick for the first dye.
Start mixing the dye.
Remove the stick when you are satisfied with the color and place it immediately under the tap of the sink under ice cold water.
At this point, you can dry the cold water from the stick with an old dish rag of some sort.
If you are dying the stick another color, then you need to leave the tape on the stick that you placed on there before to keep the white parts of the stick.

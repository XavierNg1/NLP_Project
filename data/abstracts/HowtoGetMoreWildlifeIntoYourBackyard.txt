Install a bird bath.
To encourage birds to use a new bird bath, add stepping stones and rocks to bring the bathing depth to 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) rather than the typical two or three inches in commercial baths.
Change the water regularly.
If you add an ornamental pond, construct at least one side of it with a shallow wildlife-friendly beach rather than a steep side.
Add a waterfall or fountain to attract more wild visitors with the sound of moving water.
Surround your ornamental pond or bird bath with native perennials appropriate to your region of the world.
Protect habitat.

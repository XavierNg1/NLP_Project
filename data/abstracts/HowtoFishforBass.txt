Understand the habits of Bass during each season.
Optimize your terrain.
Choose your location based on the time of day.
Fish with crankbaits when you want to cover a lot of water in light vegetation, rocky bottoms, shallow flats, and through bushes and grass.
Fish with Spinnerbaits when you want to cover a lot of water and fish through quick cover.
Fish with Topwater lures in very shallow water, or in areas that are covered in surface vegetation, such as lily pads.
Fishing with Jigs when you want a very accurate feel on the line, and are using short-range flipping and pitching techniques instead of casting out into the distance.
Fish with Plastic and Rubber Lure to imitate worms or lizards.
Match your line with the diving depth.
Choose lighter spinnerbaits for shallow water while heavier lures should be used for deeper depths.
Use a floating plastic/rubber lure, around 7 inches, with a light wire rig.
Employ a lightweight rod for buzzbaits and spinnerbaits.
Employ a sensitive and lightweight rod for crankbaits and topwater lures.
Employ a sensitive and lightweight graphite rod when using jigs or plastic/rubber lures.
Pitch your bait into or near visible brush and underwater debris.
Cast your line and bait parallel to the shore, treeline or brushline you are working and draw the bait back toward you.
Mimic fleeing or helpless prey with erratic movements when using topwater lures to activate the feeding and agitation response from bass.Create a back-and-forth or zig zag pattern on the surface of the water when you employ a walker lure.
Cast out a jig lure and give the line plenty of time to hit the bottom.
Donâ€™t reel Plastic or Rubber lures in but rather retrieve it with purpose by lifting and dropping the rod as you take up the slack of the line.

Cook the sausage until brown, and there is no more pink in the centers.
Leave the grease in the pan as it cooks, adding 1-2 tablespoons of butter for a richer gravy.
Using a wire whisk, slowly add and stir in the flour.
Slowly stir in the whole milk.
Season with ground black pepper to taste.
Simmer everything, stirring frequently until the gravy reaches your desired consistency.
Eat while still hot, adding a bit more milk and simmering if it gets too thick.

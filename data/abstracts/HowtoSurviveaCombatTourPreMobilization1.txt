The first rule of thumb is this: Embracing deployment is far easier than fighting it.
For new Soldiers, pay close attention to your DD Form 93 Emergency Data Sheet and your Soldier Group Life Insurance (SGLI) form 8286-A.
For Soldiers with family, make sure your DD Form 93 and SGLI represents your wishes.
For Soldiers who are divorced or will be divorcing their spouse-have it handy by the time you are notified of being deployed.
For Male soldiers who have children out of wedlock-you must, within 30 days of the birth of your child, obtain your child's birth certificate along with a Court Ordered Certificate of Parentage or Statement of Child Support.
Soldiers who recently gotten married or will get married- By Military Regulations, any changes of martial/family status must be reported to your unit and DEERS/ID Card, within 30 days to processes your spouse for Tricare Benefits.
Single soldiers-ensure your wishes are taken care of by a responsible ADULT.Most single soldiers have their parents be their benefactors that will continue with the Soldier's wishes "in the event".

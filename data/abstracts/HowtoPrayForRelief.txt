Prayer is simply talking out loud to the one who created you.
The most powerful prayers are not the ones spoken in old English formality but straight from the most vulnerable place inside you, your heart.
It is beneficial to get someplace private, that if you need to yell, stomp, cry or talk out loud, you can without anyone hearing or seeing you.
Start speaking out loud.
Let there be silence between your sentences.
Are you feeling your world has somehow expanded?,
These are a few common side effects of God acknowledging and responding to your prayer.

As a note: Prayer is considered a way to change the outcome of circumstances and events that entangle our lives.

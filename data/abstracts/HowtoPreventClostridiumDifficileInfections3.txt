Ensure that your healthcare facility has an antibiotic stewardship program.One of the key steps in preventing Clostridium difficile infections at the systemic level (at the level of the healthcare system, in places such as hospitals) is to have an "antibiotic stewardship program" in place.
Consider giving high levels of beneficial bacteria/germs.
Wash your hands, use vinyl gloves for simple work/visit.
Practice "contact precautions" anytime someone has diarrhea.Because diarrhea is a sign of a possible Clostridium difficile infection, it is important for healthcare staff to practice "contact precautions" anytime a patient has a case of diarrhea.
Clean and disinfect with bleach based sprays or wipes.
Ask the lab to inform you of positive results as soon as possible.Any patient in a hospital or healthcare facility who presents with diarrhea will have a sample sent to the lab to test for the presence of Clostridium difficile.

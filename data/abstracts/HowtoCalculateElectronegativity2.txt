Find the electronegativity difference between the two atoms.
If the difference is below about 0.5, the bond is nonpolar covalent.
If the difference is between 0.5-1.6, the bond is polar covalent.
If the difference is over 2.0, the bond is ionic.
If the difference is between 1.6-2.0, check for a metal.

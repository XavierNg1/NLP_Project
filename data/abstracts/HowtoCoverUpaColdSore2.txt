Wait until the cold sore has partially healed or scabbed over before applying makeup.
Choose a lipstick color that matches your natural lip color.

Dab a cotton swab into the lipstick on your hand, then use the swab to transfer the lipstick to your lips, including the cold sore.
Dispose of the cotton swab immediately.

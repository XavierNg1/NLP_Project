Measure the surface area around your computer keyboard.Go to the hardware store

,
Track down a sheet of plexiglass (plastic window pane).
Go to the 'hardware' section (where screws, hinges, knobs & things are) and track down sticky rubber feet.Lay the plastic sheet out on top of your keyboard

,
Mark wherever you'll cut or stick things with a grease pencil or dry erase marker.

,
If necessary, due to a notebook stand or other obstruction, or to access certain controls, outline where you'll need to cut/drill convenient finger-size big holes, such as for a power button.
Support the sheet thoroughly before drilling, such as by drilling into a piece of scrap wood under the plexiglass sheet, or you'll crack it like I did with my first try.
Now that the cutting is done, remove the sticky plastic.
Now bring it back and stick the rubber 'feet' on the lucite.
The stand-offs also let air circulate.

Acquire a carrot.
Cut 2 inches off the pointed end.
Take a drill bit or knife, and carefully start drilling through the middle.
Bring all the debris from your drilling out.
Using a sharp knife, make a cut about 1 inch down from the end with a hole, and about half an inch deep .
Move your knife about 1 inch backwards from the previous cut, and cut a wedge out of it, going all the way down to the bottom of the other cut.
Take the piece you cut off earlier and cut off the very end.
Carefully start to form a plug.
Cut it in half from the flat edge so it is a semi-cylindrical piece.
Insert the plug into the hole.
If desired, cut away from the edge of the carrot to make a more comfortable mouthpiece.
Blow on the mouthpiece.
Use a drill bit or knife to cut two holes below the incision made before.

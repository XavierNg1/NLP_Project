Decide what type of dog is right for you.
Look for indicators of health.
Do a temperament test.
Take your puppy to the nearest vet for check-up, they may find a health issue you missed.
Be prepared to take the puppy home.
Train your puppy to match what you want to use him for (a watchdog, a friend, etc).

Understand your abilities and limitations: Asperger's Syndrome brings with it certain benefits like keen interest in some areas along with some limitations like recurrently striking fun conversations.
Understand why you want a mate.
Think about what you want in a partner: It is good to be clear about your expectations.
Be ready for surprises: Just because you have a clear mindset about a good lover does not mean that you will get them and get just those.
Expand your level of patience.
Practice your conversations: Get out there and socialize.
Know them: You can go with the typical places you often go to or choose where you would like to initiate a conversation with someone.
If those don't work, try dating sites.
There is no shame in your Asperger's Syndrome: Think about yourself.
Strike a cord with them: Once you've come across someone you like, indicate an interest.
Basics of bonding: Flirting is not bad.
Make it about them, and try to find a connection.
Recognize signs of disinterest.
Keep obsessions away: Never ever let yourself become so obsessed with a person that you can't bear to think of a life without them.
Expect respect: Just as you are willing to accept their flaws, expect them to accept you.
Let your trials age: Just like you don't stop aging, let your desire to seek a partner and attempts to find one continue.

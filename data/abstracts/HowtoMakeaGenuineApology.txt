Know what you did wrong.
Keep it simple, being careful not to start up a fight, a disagreement, or open up the situation for further discussion or recriminations.
Be prepared to meet resistance.
It helps to say, "This is a genuine apology, I mean it from the bottom of my heart, I have thought about how wrong I was in that matter, and I hope you will accept my apology.

,
Be polite.
Remind the person of all the positive history you have between you.
Try not to smile.
In some situations a small gift may serve as a token of apology.
Express yourself.
Don't do it again!,
In some more complicated situations it may serve better to say, "I will work on this negative quality that I have of bringing things up at the wrong time.

Read the Air Chair manual to learn the correct setup and all of the possible options.
Setup the "blades".
Insert the wedge.
Tighten all bolts on the base and blades, and insert the post into the bottom of the chair and be sure the bolt is hand-tightened (not too tight) and the pin is placed through the shaft of the chair for extra safety.

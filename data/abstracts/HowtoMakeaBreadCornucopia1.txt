Start by making the cornucopia shape in foil.
Take the bottle out (with gloves, if needed to protect your skin from being scratched by the foil) and bend the foil funnel into a horned-like shape.
Cut a bunch of separate dough strips out of any fresh bread dough you wish to use.
Start curling the strips of dough around the foil shape, starting at the tail end.
Glaze the cornucopia with egg mix before you put it in.
Bake according to the instructions accompanying the dough.
Remove when baked.
Separate the cornucopia from the foil.
Fill the bread horn as you like.
Place on the table as your centerpiece for Thanksgiving or any other harvest event.

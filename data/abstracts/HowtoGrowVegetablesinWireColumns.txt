Do some research first.
Consider the types of vegetables you wish to grow.
Purchase some galvanised or rust-proofed fencing wire, preferably one with a 1 or 2 inch (2-5cm) gauge gap between the wires that is 1 to 1.5m high.
Insert the stakes into the ground until they are sturdy (they should not wobble when you push them).
Wrap the wire around the outside of the stakes and tie them securely.
Once the wire is firmly tied to the columns and there are no large gaps between the layers, start to fill the column with soil.
When sowing the seeds, plant them directly where they will grow.
After each season, it is best to dig in more manure into the column's soil to enrich it, or plant a green manure such as legumes that you dig in and allow the soil to improve by letting it be fallow for a year (this of course is a slower way, but okay if you have time).

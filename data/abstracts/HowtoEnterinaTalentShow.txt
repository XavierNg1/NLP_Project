Make sure your school has a talent show(or you could find a community talent show).
Once you are sure your school has a talent show, sign up!,
Ask friends, family, and other close people to judge you truthfully.
Be confident about your talent.
Take it seriously.
Practice!,
Before the talent show, look over your notes a practice again.
When you wake up, eat well and brush your teeth.
When it is your turn on stage, focus on what you are doing.
Clap for everyone and accept what you get.
After the show, help clean up the stage and put your props (and award!)

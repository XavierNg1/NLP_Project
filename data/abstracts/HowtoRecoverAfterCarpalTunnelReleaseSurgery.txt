Know that you will most likely be sent home shortly after surgery.A carpal tunnel release surgery is generally done as an "outpatient procedure," meaning that you show up during the day, receive the surgery, and are sent home the same day.
Wear a bandage or splint after surgery.For approximately one week following the procedure (or for however long your surgeon advises), you will need to wear a bandage or splint.
Use ice as needed.Studies examining the use of ice following surgery have had conflicting results, meaning that some patients noticed a difference in their pain levels while others did not.
Consider pain medication.You can start with over-the-counter pain medications as needed, such as Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or Ibuprofen (Advil).
Know which complications to look out for.As you heal, it is important to be on the lookout for any potential complications that may arise following surgery.
Quit smoking.If you are a smoker and have been contemplating quitting, now is the time to do so.
Begin a physical therapy rehabilitation program.This will consist of motions and exercises that improve the mobility of your wrist and hand.
Adjust your duties at work as needed.When you are in the midst of recovering, you want to avoid stressing or straining your wrist and hand by doing the same activities that triggered carpal tunnel syndrome in the first place.
Be aware of your expected prognosis.It normally takes several weeks to several months to recover fully from a carpal tunnel release surgery.
Know what to do if your symptoms return.If you notice a return of painful and bothersome symptoms following your carpal tunnel release surgery, or if your symptoms simply fail to improve with surgery, it is important to see your doctor again.

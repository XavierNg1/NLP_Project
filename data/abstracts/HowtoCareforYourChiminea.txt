The fire in a clay chiminea needs to be built on a bed of sand so the fire doesn't actually come into contact with the clay.
Start with a small fire with a few pieces of wood (on top of the sand) to season your chiminea.
Use small logs for your fires.
It's best not to move a chiminea once it's been placed.
Always let the fire die out in your chiminea.
Protect your chiminea from frost and rain during the winter with a chiminea cover.

,
Repaint any spots that peel off due to the heat.
Never lift your chiminea by the neck.

In order to test a resistor, it is important to first disconnect one lead from the circuit .. it won't matter which one.
Next, obtain an electrical meter capable of measuring resistance.
You will next need to determine the rated value of the resistor.
Set your meter to an appropriate range(nearest value higher than the expected measurement), and connect the leads(polarity will not matter).

,
Compare your reading with the value determined above.
If it is, its likely good - otherwise not.

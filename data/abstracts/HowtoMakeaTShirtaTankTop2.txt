Start with a t-shirt you won't mind cutting up.
Cut the sleeves off.
Cut the hem off your shirt, then snip it to make a long strand.
Trim the back of the armholes into a racerback shape.
Cut a deep V-shape into the back of your shirt.
Tie one end of the fabric strand to the bottom of the V-shape.
Wrap the strand around the fabric moving downward.
Wrap the strand back towards the top of the shirt and secure the end.
Consider trimming the bottom of your tank top to give it a high-low look.
Wear your racerback.

Diamonds are graded on four qualities, known as the 4 C's.

About Clarity: Inclusions are not bad, though the common connotation has slightly negative tones.
About Color: It takes a diamond master to compare any diamond to make out a colour grade with the naked eye.
About Cut: Diamond cut can affect its value by 50% or more.
The 'Very Good' and 'Good' cut grades offer great quality stones reasonably priced as compared to the 'Ideal' / 'Excellent' cut grades.

Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet on medium heat.
Dice 1 small onion and 2-3 cloves of garlic and add to the oil.
Thinly slice your mushrooms while the onions and garlic cook.
Add the mushrooms to the skillet once your onions are translucent.
Heat up 6 cups of broth while the mushrooms cook.
Cook the mushrooms for 3-5 minutes, then add 1 tablespoon of butter and your herbs.
Add the 2 cups of arborio rice and stir regularly.
Add 1/2 cup of white wine.
Add one ladle-full of hot broth.
Stir the broth and rice regularly.
Add another cup of broth once the first has been absorbed.
Repeat until the broth is gone or the rice is your desired consistency.
Remove from the heat and serve.
To create a creamier risotto, substitute 1 cup cream of mushroom soup for 1 cup of broth.
Use red wine instead of white for a pink, savory risotto.

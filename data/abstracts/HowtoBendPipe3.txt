Connect the markings where the bends will be made, using a straightedge or ruler.
Lay your 90-degree bend pipe inside the top line of your frame.
Slide the pipe until it touches the diagonal you drew.

,
Mark the place where the bend mark intersects the frame line.

,
Rotate the pipe so the other bend mark intersects the diagonal.
Repeat the last 4 steps for the other upper corner.

,
Calculate the total length of pipe needed.
Cut the pipe.
Find and mark the center of the pipe.
Lay the pipe against the top line of your layout frame, aligning the pipe's center with the center line.
Make each of the upper bends with your bending tool.
Make each of the lower bends with your bending tool.
Cut off any excess from the ends of the bent pipe.

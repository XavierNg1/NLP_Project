Go to the HTML page for your blog.
Don't try to look for a separate image with a different color if all you want to do is change the background color.
You will see the HEX number of the existing color instead of the X's displayed in the sample code.
Select the image that you want to add as the background.
Upload the image.
Get the image URL.
Insert the code for adding an image as the background.
Save the changes after you edit HTML and view your blog.

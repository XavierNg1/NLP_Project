Purchase a Soul Trap spell or scroll from any Mage's Guild hall across Cyrodiil or from another trader dealing in Soul Trap spells - you cannot capture a soul without one.
Acquire a soul gem - the types of soul gem are petty, lesser, common, greater, grand and black.
Locate a creature who's soul you want to capture, or if you have a Black soul gem, an NPC (such as an Arena combatant or bandit).
Cast your Soul Trap spell on the intended target, or hit them with your Soul Trap-enchanted weapon, and kill them with a soul gem in your inventory before the duration of the spell runs out.
Look in your inventory at your soul gems and you'll see a filled soul gem and captured a soul.

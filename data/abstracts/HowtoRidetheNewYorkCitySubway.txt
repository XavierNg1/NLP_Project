Get or use a computer and log on to the MTA website, look at the map, and find your departure and arrival stations.
Make sure you have the appropriate fare on your MetroCard.
Estimate the time it will take to arrive at your destination - by looking at the subway map or using the TripPlanner+.
Know what a station entrance looks like.
At your departure station, you can ask a station agent, if one is available, for a map so that you have a portable guide.
Buy a MetroCard from either the station agent (cash only), the MetroCard Vending Machines (cash/credit/debit), or at various merchants scattered throughout the 5 boroughs.
Getting on the right train is hard for a tourist.
One of the mistakes many tourists make is getting on an express train when they should have taken the local train.
Before boarding your train, wait for the disembarking passengers to fully egress before you enter the subway car.
If you are wearing a bag or pack, remove it from your back or shoulder and carry it in your hands in front of you.
If you want to sit, take the first available seat.
Avoid looking other passengers directly in the eye for more than an instant.
Although asking for directions or help is perfectly fine, it's best not talk to people you don't know.
If you are accidentally short on change, step aside from the MetroCard machines and keep looking for change.
If your MetroCard won't read for some reason, try the other turnstiles after several failed attempts on the first.
If you are a tourist, get a city map.
Obtain a refillable MetroCard through a station MetroCard Vending Machine.

Check the record for any surface scratches or marks.
Avoid very dusty records unless you have a reliable way to clean them.
Feel the thickness of the record, looking directly from the sides to see any warping.
Pay attention to a record's grade, avoiding anything lower than VG when purchasing.
Always try to listen to expensive records before you buy them.

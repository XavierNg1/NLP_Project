The bag is an important part of back to school.
Your binder(s) should go in the biggest section, the one closest to your back.
The second biggest pocket is where your books should go.
The final and smallest section should be on the front of your bag.
For many bags, this is just the bare minimum.
Put the heaviest things closest to your back and the lightest things furthest; the weight will balance itself out and you won't be falling backwards half the time.

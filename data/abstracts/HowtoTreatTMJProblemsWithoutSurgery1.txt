Avoid motions or activities that cause pain to your jaw.This may sound obvious, but avoiding triggers for your jaw pain, such as chewing gum, yawning, or even singing, can help to prevent worsening of the pain.
Focus on good posture.Especially for those who work at a computer all day, getting up to move around and changing posture frequently is important.
Apply heat to relax your jaw muscles.
Use ice packs to help relieve pain.Applying ice packs can reduce the inflammation and pain by constricting the blood vessels around your TMJ.
Massage your jaw area to relax your muscles.
Get physically active.If you don't already exercise regularly, now may be a good time to start!

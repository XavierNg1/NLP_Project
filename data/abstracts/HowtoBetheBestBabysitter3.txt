Remember that a child's safety is your number one priority.
Set your boundaries early and remain consistent.
Don't get emotional or angry when they misbehave.
Reward good behavior instead of punishing bad behavior whenever possible.
Ask the parents what they do to discipline their children.
Focus on building respect, not authority.
Be honest, but polite, with the parents when they return.

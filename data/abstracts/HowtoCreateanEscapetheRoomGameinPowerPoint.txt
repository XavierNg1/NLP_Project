Now, for the game, click one of the arrows (make sure you have more than 5 slides for this game!,
For the other slide that you made the arrow hyperlink to, make another arrow, that faces the opposite way of the other in the previous slide, then hyperlink it to the previous one.

Try adding a puzzle or riddle.
Shapes/rectangle.
Create another doorknob, which covers the group doorknob.

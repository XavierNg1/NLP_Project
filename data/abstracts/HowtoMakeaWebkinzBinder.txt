Find a binder that you like.
If you don't have them already, get a fairly large number of page protectors.
Gather the rest of your materials.
Set everything down on a flat surface.
Draw and color a front page to put on the cover.
Put in the information that you've gathered.
Keep adding to your Webkinz binder over time.
Have fun with it!

Get a couple of suitable boards for your project.
Set up a work table or other surface to measure and cut the lumber on.
Rip the lumber in half if you are using 2X6 boards and they do not have big knots or have to support a great deal of weight.
Measure the length of the legs to a comfortable working height.
Cut a bevel on the first leg when you cut it to length.
Cut the back or top board of your horse, which will be sawed square on both ends, about 42-48 inches (107-122cm) long.
Lay the back board on a flat surface, whether a work table, on a smooth floor, or even on the tailgate of a pickup truck.
Nail both legs on one side of the top board, then flip the assembly over.
Stand your partially assembled horses upright, and measure down from the bottom of your top board about 8 inches (20cm), and using a short board, scribe it to be a horizontal spreader brace to fit between the legs.
Nail your braces in place, using two 12d nails in each end, going first through the leg, and into the end-grain of the brace.
Flip the horse back over on its top board, and prop it in place or have someone hold it.
Nail these braces in place, with the end cut on a 45 degree angle butted into the spreader brace and nailed through from the brace into the end grain, and the scribed end to the underside of the top board.
Check your horses to make sure the legs are equal in length and fit the ground evenly, if not, you can trim the legs that are long, making sure the top board is parallel to the ground.

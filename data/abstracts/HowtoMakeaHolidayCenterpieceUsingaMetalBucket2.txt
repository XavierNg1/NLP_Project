Hunt for “found items.” Part of what makes this centerpiece unique is that you can integrate items found in nature or within your home.
Hit the craft or home store for items like ribbon, decorative flourishes (such as faux flowers, ornaments etc.).
Select the right bucket or container to hold your centerpiece.

Choose your scrapbooking paper.
Fold the paper in half, lengthwise.
Cut the paper in half in the middle.
Cut each paper into a triangle.
Lay out your string and mark off about 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) at each end.
Open up one of your triangles and coat the inside with glue.
Place the string along the fold and close the triangle.
Repeat the gluing process for the rest of the triangles.
Consider writing a message on your banner by putting a letter on each triangle.

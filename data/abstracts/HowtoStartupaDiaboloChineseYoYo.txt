If you are right-handed, follow the instructions precisely.
Place the diabolo down on the ground directly in front of you.
Roll the diabolo over to your right foot, and let it stop.
Before it stops spinning, move the right stick up and down in a "hitting" motion.
The diabolo will naturally tilt away from or toward you.
The diabolo naturally tends to unbalance until you learn to keep it at consistent high speeds.
When you can keep the diabolo level and with reasonable speed, try learning to throw and catch it.

Choose suitable materials - you will need flowers with fairly long stems such as roses, irises, carnations, alstroemeria, freesias, Singapore orchids and lisianthus.
Cut the ends of the stems on a slant and give the flowers a long drink.
Lay the flowers out on the table.

,
Start off with the largest flower to form the centre.
Holding the bouquet in the same way as before, with the thumb facing towards you, place 5-6 of the same type of flowers evenly around the bouquet.
Continue adding flowers for the next round extending these flowers out slightly further.
Continue adding flowers and foliage stems turning the bouquet around clockwise until the bouquet is the desired size.
Cut the ends off the flower and foliage stems so they are about 6-8"(15-20cm)long and all the same level.

,
Spray lightly with water.

,
Finish off the bouquet by tying a piece of wide ribbon around the bouquet to cover the string and tie the ribbon in a shoelace bow with long tails.

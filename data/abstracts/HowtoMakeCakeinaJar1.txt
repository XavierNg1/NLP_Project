Preheat your oven to 350°F (177°C) and prep the jars.
Beat the butter and sugar.
Add the eggs gradually, then the vanilla extract.
Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl.
Alternate between adding the flour mixture and the half-and-half into the butter mixture.
Fill the jars halfway with batter.
Set the jars onto a baking sheet, then bake them for 25 minutes.
Seal the cakes, if desired.
Serve the cakes straight from the jars.

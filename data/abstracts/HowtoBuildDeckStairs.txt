Include certain basic or nominal features, such as a minimum width of 48 inches (1200 mm), tread of 10.5 inches (275 mm), and a height of the riser or step of approximately 7-to-8 inches (175-to-200 mm) in your design.
Measure the height of the stair from the bottom of the decking -- or top of the floor joist -- to the ground and then divide by the 7-to-8 inches (175-to- 200 mm).
Lay out the steps on the stringer, using 2 x 12-inch (50 x 304 mm) treated wood, with a framing square.
Cut the riser and steps out with a circular saw, but stop just short of cutting through.
Install the stringers by attaching them at the top of the deck outside the framing using metal floor joist hangers.

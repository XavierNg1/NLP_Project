Sketch in the head.
Draw his brows, circles for the eyeballs, and dots for the pupils.
Sketch in his clean-cut hair.
Draw rectangles for his body, a large one for his upper body and a smaller one for the lower part.
Don't forget that Joe is sitting on a wheelchair so remember that when you draw his legs, so he's in a sitting position.
Sketch in his clothes and shoes.
Now sketch in his chair.
Draw in the smaller front wheels and the larger ones at the back.
Outline and color him in.

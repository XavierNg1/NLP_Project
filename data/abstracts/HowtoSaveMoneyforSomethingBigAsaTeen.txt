Decide on what you want to get.
Set aside half of all funds received.
Get a job (if you are old enough).
Budget wisely.
Sell handmade or craft items at school, if this is allowed.
Research prices and shop around, once 95 percent of the money is tucked away.
Get a big jar or tin and put every coin, note and whatever cash you find laying in your wallet, your table, etc.

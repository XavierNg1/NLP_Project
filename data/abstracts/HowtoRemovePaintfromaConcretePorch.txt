First assess whether your under-surface is poured concrete, mortared concrete block, or block with some kind of coating over it such as stucco.
If you've got mortared block or block with a coated or stuccoed surface, mechanical paint removal methods could seriously damage your walls, so are not recommended.

Next, determine whether the paint is adhering well, or it is bubbling, peeling, or flaking.
If you don't have concerns about damaging your walls or concrete floor, old paint can be powered off with a pressure washer or sand blaster.
Once you can see the underlying surface of your wall/floor, you can determine whether old paint failed due to some sealant or other priming issues on your concrete surface.
If the area you're dealing with is not huge, and especially if the old paint is adhering well to the concrete, you may opt for chemical removal.
Chemical removal of paint from concrete or stone requires an acid.
Apply the acid directly from the bottle with a sponge or cloth.
Whichever paint removal method you use, capture the scrapings or rinsed off paint residue for proper disposal.

If you suspect that the paint residue contains lead, contact your local trash collection authorities before you start your project for information on proper handling and disposal.

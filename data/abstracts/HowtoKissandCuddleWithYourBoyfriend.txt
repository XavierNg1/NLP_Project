Sidle up to him.
Let him put his arm around you.
Do the reclining cuddle.
Do the sitting spoon.
Do the "Mama Bear" spoon.
Do the "Papa Bear" spoon.
Avoid a few terrible cuddling moves.
Lock eyes.
Caress his face.
Give him a passionate kiss on the lips.
French kiss him.
Kiss other parts of his face and neck.
Keep on cuddling.
Let him see how much you liked kissing and cuddling with him.

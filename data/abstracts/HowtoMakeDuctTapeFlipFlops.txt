Hold the straps together, and wrap the short piece of tape around the bottom.
Place your foot down onto the flip flop and make a mark between the big toe and the one next to it using a pen.
Poke a hole in the flip flop using the pen mark as a guide.
Poke the toe strap through the hole, and tape the excess to the underside of the sole.
Fit the side straps.
Tape the side straps to the underside of the sole.

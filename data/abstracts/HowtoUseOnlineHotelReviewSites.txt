Check out more than one source.
Search for the hotel.
Click next to the stars, where it says "X number of Google reviews" and you will be taken directly to the hotel's Google Places page, where you can read the reviews.
Check the local Chamber of Commerce site for the city the hotel is in.

Understand that a bad review might just be sour grapes.
Use several sources rather than just one.
If you do find bad reviews, check to see if the owner or some other representative of the hotel has taken the time and effort to respond to them.
Although the number of reviews can be a good indication the quality of the hotel, keep in mind that a small lodge or inn gets fewer guests then a gigantic hotel chain, and therefore will logically get fewer reviews.

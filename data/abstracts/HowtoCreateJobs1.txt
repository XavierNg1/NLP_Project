Plan how to start catching ideas and making hopes and dreams "appear" (something "ventured" makes it possible to "gain", earn, serve) in your life, in the flesh -- solving problems, whether you are employed or not, as small (even alone) as you may first desire or need (as fits your reality) -- to create a micro, small service, retail, wholesale, e-Internet, or make things like hand crafts, or building, fabricating or manufacturing, as large as is practical.
Find your niche.
Do what works -- on the scale that works -- for you.
Start "something", hopefully in growing services/abstract or concrete products, enterprises (services may be "industries", too) -- and eventually create jobs for several or multitudes (dream it).
Believe big, i.e.
Serve and create in an area of a need -- or create a product or a market; especially, start in a need that is opening up in a new way, possibly.

First, in front of your castle/Tower of Power or whatever, dig a 4 long by 4 to 6 wide hole.
Craft 6 sticky pistons.
Place blocks on top of the pistons.
Now it gets complicated.
Make a staircase shape and place a lever at the top.
Test your contraption.
Craft some buckets (craft by 3 iron ingots in a bowl/bucket shape on PC) and fill them with water or lava/magma.

,
If it works, turn on the bridge.
Inside those two indentations, pour the lava/water bucket in, then refill the bucket and pour the contents into the opposite side.Keep pouring in the buckets until the holes are full, but not overflowing.

,
Now you have a drawbridge!

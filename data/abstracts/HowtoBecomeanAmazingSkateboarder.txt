Don't be scared.
Don't get stuck skating the same old thing every single day.
Don't limit your skating to skateparks.
Don't be afraid to get hurt.
Bring your board everywhere.
Always have a friend ready to film you when you are going out to skate and try your hardest and if you fall get back up and try it again till you get you trick down.

,
If you know you can do the trick, do the trick.

Take precautions beforehand.
Ask yourself if you're expecting anyone around that time.
Look out a window to see who it is.
If you don't know or trust the person at your door, consider arming yourself.
Ask who it is, and have them verify their identity if they claim to be a worker or salesman.
If the visitor is unwanted, tell them to leave.
Agree on a code word with your family and friends, and use it to ensure visitors can be trusted.
If nothing else, just ignore it.

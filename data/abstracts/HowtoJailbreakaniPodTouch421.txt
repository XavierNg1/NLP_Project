Confirm that the iPod you have is in fact Version 4.2.1.
Go to www.greenpois0n.com which is a jailbreaking website that is known to be the easiest way to get the job done.
A box will pop up that has the options, one that says Greenpois0n and then right under something that says README.
It will have 4 simple steps that you follow within the amount of seconds given.
After the jailbreak has been completed your iPod should flash white and then turn black and display a bunch of white letters across the screen.
Go to Loader after your device has finished loading and tap "Install Cydia.",After Cydia has been installed, open it up and on the bottom there will be some buttons, tap on Manage.
Open Installous, which should now be downloaded onto your iPod in the area where your other applications are.

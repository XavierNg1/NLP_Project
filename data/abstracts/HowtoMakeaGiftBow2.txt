Cut a long length of wide ribbon.
Lay the ribbon across the top of the box, facing vertically.
Check that the wrong side of the ribbon is facing the box.
Fix the ribbon if needed.
Make loops from each of the ribbon ends.
Bring the left loop over the right loop, then slide the left loop through the hole under the right loop.
Trim the ends of the ribbon to neaten.
Done.

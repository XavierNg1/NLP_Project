Aim to stand out.
Try wearing baby tees, a trendy shirt (maybe from a video game or dj), or bright neon stuff from the eighties.
Wear brightly colored, sparkly makeup and eyeliner.
Wear a backpack.
For bottoms, tight skinny jeans on either gender always work.
Choose shoes you can dance all night in.
Accessorize to be seen.
Kandi is a good idea, too.
Get creative.

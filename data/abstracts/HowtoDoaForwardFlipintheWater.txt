Lay out.
Take a breath.
Tuck your knees in.
Begin moving your arms.
Bring yourself up.
Leave the tucked in position.
Kick to the surface.
Emerge from the water.
For a tumble turn, use the same method for this forward roll, but, once you have finished the roll, stay under the water, go onto your back, push the wall with your feet and turn back over onto your stomach.

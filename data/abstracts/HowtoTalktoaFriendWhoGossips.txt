See for yourself if the person is a gossip - if you are just taking someone else's word that they are, then you'll never know the truth and will have been wrongly accusing them of gossiping.
Be aware of what you say when you are speaking to them.
Change the subject if you are uncomfortable with what you are discussing.
Share good things with your friend about yourself.
Make sure the friend knows that what you are telling them is private and for no one else to know, if you are intent on sharing personal information with them.
Get them to really open up about themselves - one thing gossips love to talk about is themselves.
Keep a close-knit group of friends and family who you can trust and depend on.
Make sure other friends and family members who you can trust stop gossiping too.
Confront and express your feelings to your friend if you have proof they have been gossiping about you.
Consider terminating the friendship.

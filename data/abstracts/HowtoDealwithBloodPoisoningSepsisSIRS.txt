Get immediate, serious medical attention, if in doubt about possibly having symptoms of either mild or severe sepsis due to a possible infection (symptoms given below).
Get expert evaluation and treatment of infection, with or without pain or throbbing pain.
Observe symptoms of sepsis while the patient is at rest (resting rates) according doctors at the Mayo Clinic:Fever, high body temperature, greater than 101.3째F (38.5째C), possibly chills;

Or Low body temperature, less than 95째F (35째C), in a warm place, perhaps shivering;
Below normal blood pressure;
Pulse rate is rapid, higher than 90 per minute;
Respiratory rate higher than 20 breaths a minute (shallow/short breath);
Has a probable or confirmed infection.

,
Seek "intensive care", if you think you see a possible symptom of "severe sepsis": If a person already may have symptoms of mild sepsis and then shows any one of the following symptoms of severe sepsis, get expert medical treatment.
Seek immediate treatment/hospitalization if several of those symptoms are observed: Severe cases often require antibiotics given in an intensive care unit for several days or weeks:Early treatment of worsening sepsis, usually with antibiotics and large amounts of intravenous fluids, in an intensive care unit at a hospital, greatly improves the chance for survival, before it causes blood clots, gangrene or one even develops septic shock.
Diagnosing sepsis can be difficult because its observable signs and symptoms can be caused by other illnesses/disorders.
Show caution; watch any inflammation or infection possibly becoming worse: the beginning symptoms of sepsis all depend on where an infection started, as seemingly minor as:


Scrapes on a knee, deep paper cut, puncture by a construction nail,
A tampon left in place longer than intended;
Stress causes/increases inflammation:

Poor diet, lack of sleep, over-work,
Smoking, anxiety, worry, belly fat,
Allergies, pollution and various chemicals;


Serious infections or illness including:

Pneumonia, lung infection causing sepsis,
Abdominal infections (sepsis, possibly with deadly peritonitus),
Kidney infection (sepsis and possible kidney failure),
Bloodstream infection, bacteremia (bacteria in your blood -- normally such a sterile environment -- always a very bad sign)...



,
Avoid or prevent infections:


Be immunized for illnesses, such as: Influenza and pneumonia.
Keep unwashed hands (Avoid germs!),
Avoid sleeplessness, overexertion and fatigue, especially when ill or recovering from illness.
Take care with the following risk factors.

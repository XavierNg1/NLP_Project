In normal unassisted births, a foal born live will break the sac on his own when he shakes his head.
Get the foal breathing as quick as you can, clearing mucus away from his nose with a suction bulb.
Once new momma and baby are delivered and the foal is breathing normally, leave them alone.
Disinfect the navel stump with iodine.
The afterbirth should soon follow 15 to 45 minutes later after birth, sometimes taking around 2 hours to be completely shed.
Bag up the afterbirth immediately, then spread it out on a table to let it dry and have a look at it to see if it's intact and a health coloration or not.
If all is well and both the mare and her foal are healthy and happy, enjoy watching the foal grow into a healthy new horse!

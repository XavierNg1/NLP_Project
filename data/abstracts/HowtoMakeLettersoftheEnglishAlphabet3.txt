Use a piece of lined paper.
Practice the letter a.
Make the letter b.
Try the letter c. You write c the same way whether it is in uppercase or lowercase, but if you are writing lowercase, make your c smaller than an uppercase C, so it's the same size as the other lowercase letters.
Make the letter d. Lowercase d is written like a backwards b (step 2 under lowercase).
Try the letter e. You draw lowercase e with quite a few curves.
Make the letter f. Draw a curve, and bring it down in a vertical line.
Practice the letter g. Draw a c, and then an upside down, lowercase f (step 6 under lowercase, without the horizontal line in the middle) below it.
Try the letter h. Draw a vertical line, then about halfway down the line, curve into another vertical line, swooping upwards.
Make the letter i.
Practice the letter j.
Try the letter k. Same as uppercase K, except the lines angling up and down do not quite reach the top.
Practice the letter l. Draw one vertical line.
Make the letter m. Draw a straight line.
Do the letter n. Same as lowercase m (step 13 under lowercase), but make only one hump.
Make the letter o.
Try the letter p. Same as uppercase P, but lower on the line of writing.
Make the letter q.
Practice the letter r. Draw a straight line.
Make the letter s. Same as uppercase S, except it is the size of the other lowercase letters.
Try the letter t. Same as uppercase T, except here the horizontal line is a little under the top, instead of at the very top.
Make the letter u.
Try the letter v. Same as uppercase V, except it is the size of the other lowercase letters.
Practice the letter w. There are two ways to do this one.
Try the letter x.
Make the letter y.
Try the letter z.

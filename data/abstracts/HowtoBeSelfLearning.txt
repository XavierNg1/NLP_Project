In order to be motivated, make sure you really want to learn something.
Take a look at the information you have at the moment: does it provide you enough stuff to learn?,
As said above, start learning.
If there is anything you can practice, maybe if you try to learn dancing some steps or in school exercises just do them.
Get more experienced people to judge you.
Gather knowledge.
Throw time at it.
Organize your learning.
Look into SRS.

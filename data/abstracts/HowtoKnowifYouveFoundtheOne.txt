Stop chasing ideals.
Let yourself be loved for who you are.
Make your significant other happy.
Re-evaluate your values.
Consider your appearance.
Manage conflict but drop the drama.
Laugh.
Enjoy the ordinary and the mundane.
Connect.
Respect and be respected.
Talk about the future.
Share everything.
Look for fireworks.
Put "we" before "me.",
Live the relationship more than you talk about it.
Take a poll.
Love his social circle.
Spend time together and apart.

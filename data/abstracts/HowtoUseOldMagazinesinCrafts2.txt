Choose an old magazine.
Open the first page of the magazine and crease it well.
Fold the right hand side of the first crease down so that it is flush with the center of the magazine.
Fold the bottom triangle of the magazine page up so that it is flush with the bottom of the magazine.
Turn the page and do the same 3 steps with the next page, making sure to fold as flat as you possibly can.
Glue the edges together with craft glue so that it forms a cylindrical tree.

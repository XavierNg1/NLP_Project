While it's uncommon for boys to paint their nails, remember you are not the only one who might do this.
Purchase nail polish or borrow a bottle from a relative or friend.
Obtain nail polish remover.
Wash your hands with soap and water.
Before using the color you've chosen, apply a base coat to your nails, using clear or base coat nail polish.
Once the base coat has dried, carefully paint the colored nail polish onto your fingernails.
If you wish for extra shine or protection on your nails, apply a coat of clear nail polish.

Remember that not everyone will understand why you like to paint your nails.
Have confidence in yourself.
If you are bullied, defend yourself or ignore the bullies till they get tired of teasing you.

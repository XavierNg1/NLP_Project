Plan in advance.
Identify the concert and get as much information about it as you can.
If your parents are unfamiliar with the venue, try to find some pictures of the place to show them.
Your chances of getting to go to the concert may be better if you buy the ticket yourself, rather than asking your parents to spend the money.
Know how you're getting to the concert.
Make it very, very clear to your parents that the person doing the driving will not touch alcohol or drugs on the night of the concert.
Introduce your parents to the friends you'll be going with.
If you have a sibling that's older or close to your own age, offer to take them along if it wouldn't completely spoil your evening.
Going to concerts is a privilege, not a right.
Your parents may be concerned about the way you're dressed, especially if you're a girl.
Consider avoiding the "mosh pit.",
Pick out some things about the band or their music that your parents could appreciate.
Consider agreeing on a curfew.
Tell your parents that at the concert, you will carry a cell phone, keep it with you all the time, and check it every hour or so.

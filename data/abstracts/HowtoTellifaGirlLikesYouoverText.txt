Pay attention to how often she starts the conversation.If initiating the conversation always falls on your shoulders, odds are, she is not very interested.
See if she is usually the first to say goodbye.
Count the emoticons.
Determine how interested she is in what you have to say by her replies.If she has good, thorough responses to your comments, it shows a higher degree of interest in your thoughts and, by extension, a higher interest in you.
Be encouraged if she starts to tease you.Texts like, "You should be wishing you were here right now..." or "If you were here right now..." are usually meant to tease you into wondering what the rest of the sentence would read, especially when they end with the "..." They are mildly suggestive without being too over the top, implying that she wants to get you to think about her and wonder about her feelings and intentions a little more.

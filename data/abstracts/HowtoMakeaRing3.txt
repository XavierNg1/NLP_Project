Find an object that is about the same size as your finger to make your ring on.
Wrap a piece of fairly thick wire around the object once.
Bend one of the overhanging ends into a loop.
Bend the other overhanging end into a matching loop.
Wrap a piece of thin wire in a contrasting color around the center of the bow.
File all the wire ends down to make them smooth.
Put the ring on.

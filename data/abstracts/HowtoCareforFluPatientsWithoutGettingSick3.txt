Understand that the easiest way for the flu virus to be transmitted is via respiratory droplets.If a person coughs or sneezes near you, if they talk within close proximity to you, or if an intimate partner kisses you, you will be at high risk of catching the virus.
Know that the flu can also be transmitted via contaminated objects and surfaces.A less common (but still possible) way for the flu to be transmitted is by touching something after an infected person has touched it, and picking up the germs that way.
Be aware that you can catch the flu even before the infected person shows symptoms.Many people do not realize that they are contagious one day before the onset of symptoms.

Before you extend an offer, determine your absolute limits and where some less costly "perks" might come in.
Another way to ascertain if you can deliver a competitive offer is to see what the other guys are presenting.
Be smart.
Deliver the offer you think it appropriate, fair and generous in writing and in person.
Highlight corporate benefits.
Anticipate your applicantâ€™s response to your offer.
Be flexible but also be honest.

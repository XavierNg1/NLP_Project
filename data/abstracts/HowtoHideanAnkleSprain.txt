First and foremost, make sure that you treat your ankle very well before the event.
Take some painkillers before the event so you are not in too much pain.
If your ankle is feeling very sore and delicate, it's best to keep the tensor bandage on during the event.
Ladies, try to avoid high heels.
To avoid limping, which would be a dead giveaway of the injury, walk on the balls of your feet.
Stay seated as much as possible to prevent unnecessary strain from your ankle.

,
When standing, keep your weight on your uninjured foot.

,
If dancing is involved, keep it low-key.
Tell people you are feeling a bit tired, and they won't be surprised if you take frequent breaks to sit down, which will allow you to rest your ankle.

,
Take bathroom breaks every 2 hours; soak some toilet tissue in cold water and wrap it around your ankle while in the bathroom to soothe it.

,
Go home early!

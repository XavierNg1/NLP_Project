Get tactical!,
Learn the maps.
Examine your opponent carefully before attacking and know how to kill them depending on their position and weapon.
Maintain the element of surprise.
Be aware of your surroundings - if you are the last one left and you see an enemy, make sure there isn't another enemy nearby to kill you right after you have finished chain-sawing their friend.
Attack!,
Retreat if you have to.
Take advantage of situations, whether it be creeping up on an unsuspecting sniper or entering a shotgun fray where your enemy is only trying to kill an ally.
Practice, practice, practice!

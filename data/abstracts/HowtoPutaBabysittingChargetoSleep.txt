Stop all active and outdoors activities an hour before bedtime.
Have the child do a few calming activities, such as reading (or if he/she can't read, you read to them) or listening to soft music.
Get the child's pajamas on or have them do so twenty or thirty minutes before bed.
If their parents don't mind, or haven't instructed you not to, allow the child to have a small, non-sugar snack.Keep the snack small, itâ€™s just something so that the child won't come complaining of hunger to you later.
Take the child upstairs.
Quietly put the books away, and say goodnight to the child.
Once the child is in bed falling asleep, don't make lots of noise.

Avoid thinking that the same criteria applies to all people.
Consider firstly Human needs.
Think about group dynamics.
Consider government politics.
Consider local politics.
Consider Assets.
Consider the deadliest thing of all - culture.
Consider that changes of circumstances may put people to living in shanty towns or similar makeshift homes on the streets.
Consider education.Those who have never had much education more than survival skills, simply would not value education when it does not improve their lives.
Consider that people can be more considerate of "street thinking" if they work there, be it running a shop or business of some kind, or working as a social worker, council worker etc Or those that live there - it may be living on the street or in a house on the street or in the local area.
Remind yourself that everyone is different and that why they think as "street people" or "non street people" varies on an enormous range of factors unique to every individual.

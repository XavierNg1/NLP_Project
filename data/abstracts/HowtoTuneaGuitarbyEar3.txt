Tune the low E string to D, as for drop D. The first few steps of tuning to open D are essentially the same as those for tuning to drop D. You'll want to begin by tuning your guitar's low E string to a D reference tone.
Tune the A and D strings as you would for drop D. Next, you'll want to tune the following two strings exactly as you did for drop D tuning.
Tune the G string to the 4th fret of the D string.
Tune the B string to the 3rd fret of the G string.
Tune the high E string the 5th fret of the B string.

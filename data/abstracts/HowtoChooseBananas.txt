Pick the bananas according to what you will use them for and when you plan to use them.
Buy only the amount of bananas you feel you can consume before they become overripe.
Look for bananas with no brown spots or obvious signs of handling damage.
Consider buying smaller bunches of bananas at varying stages of ripeness so you can eat them as they ripen in the following days.

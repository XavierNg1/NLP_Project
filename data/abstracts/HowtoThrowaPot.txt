Get the proper clay.
Put the clay on the center of the wheel head.
Using both hands firmly against the spinning clay, pull it into a conical shape.
Centering the clay means that its outer edges spin perfectly smooth with no bumps or wobbles.
Once the clay is centered, it is time to open it.
To enlarge the hole, put your finger into the hole you've already created and slowly start bringing it towards your body.
Compress the bottom.
The next step is to thin and raise the walls.
Even out the top.

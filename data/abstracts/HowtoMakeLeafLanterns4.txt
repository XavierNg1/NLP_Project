Prepare your leaves.
Get a glass vase, bowl, or jar, and clean it well.
Coat your glass object with a layer of decoupage glue.You can do this using a foam brush or a paintbrush.
Press the leaves against the glass object.You can use as many or as few leaves as you want.
Let the leaves dry, then paint another coat of decoupage glue over the leaves.Apply the glue directly to the leaves, then spread it outward towards the edges of the leaves.
Let the lantern dry completely.At this point, you can choose to apply a second or even third coat of decoupage glue.
Consider adding a wire handle if your glass object has a neck.
Make a loop in the middle of the wire.
Wrap the loose ends of the wire around the neck of your lantern.
Cut the wire that you used to create the coils off using a pair of wire cutters.
Fold the remaining wire strand over to the loop you made earlier.
Use the lantern.

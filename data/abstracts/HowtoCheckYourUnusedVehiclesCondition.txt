Set up a schedule for checking the car.
,

When you first check your car, you should check the body.

Check the tires before setting off.

Start up the vehicle and take it for a quick ride.

Smell for any exhaust.

Once you've shut off the engine, pop the hood.

Check the engine oil.

Check the engine coolant.

Check the windshield washer fluid.

If you're leaving your car for some time, release the handbrake (parking brake) and chock the wheels.

Close everything up, lock the doors, and check back again in a week!

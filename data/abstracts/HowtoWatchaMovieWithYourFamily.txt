Begin at a time that is good for everyone.
Select the room you are going to watch the movie in.
Make popcorn.
Pick a movie.
Turn the lights off, if no one will get scared and cry about it.
Ask everyone to be quiet and tell them to enjoy the movie.
At the end of the movie, ask your family what they thought about it.
If there was a moral of the story (and there usually is), discuss it with your family.
Bedtime is a great way to end a movie night!

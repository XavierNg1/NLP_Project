This tutorial will illustrate the basic process with a simple drawing, but the same steps can easily applied to even the most complex compositions.
Open CorelPainter and create a new document.
Create a rough sketch with the 2B pencil tool using a color other than black.
Create a new layer and name this "outline.",
Switch from the pencil to the detail airbrush tool and carefully trace over your sketch to create an outline.
Duplicate the outline layer and rename this layer "flat colors" Use the fill tool to color your outline.
Create a new layer and name it "shadows.",
These shadows are rather harsh and, frankly, ugly.
When you have the shadows finished, create a new layer and call this "highlights.",
Now add some texture to the picture.
Give the image a simple, single color background with a cast shadow under the figure.

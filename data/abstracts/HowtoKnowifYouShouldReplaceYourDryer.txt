Observe your dryer’s efficiency.
Pay attention to strange sounds and smells.
Confirm that it’s actually broken.
Take the age of the unit into account.

Follow the “50% rule.” If your dryer is more than 50% through its lifespan and is estimated to cost more than 50% of its original price to repair, you’ll probably be better off buying a new one.
See if the dryer can be repaired.

Look for a dryer that suits your needs.

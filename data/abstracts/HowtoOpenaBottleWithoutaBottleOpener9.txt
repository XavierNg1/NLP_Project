Take a kitchen rug and fold it so that it's just a bit larger than the bottom of the bottle.

Put the rug over the bottom of the bottle, and then, holding the rug in place, bang the bottom of the bottle against a wall.
Keep doing that, increasing the force of the blows, and the cork will slowly ease out of the bottle.

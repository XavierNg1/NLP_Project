Look at your equipment: Every Spy has a deadly and accurate 6/24 Revolver (Primary), the class based Sapper (Secondary) and a deadly Knife (Melee).
Understand the nature of disguising: There are several points to consider when attempting to disguise.
Don't hide from the battle: The cloak and dagger allows Spies to remain cloaked indefinitely, but a good Spy won't take advantage of that ability.
Be deceptive and unpredictable: Players are humans, and will be more careful as you become more successful.
Understand the nature of your cloak: The cloak, as expected, will render you invisible.
Stay out of the way of enemy Pyros: In general, Pyros are one of your arch nemesis, since they can burn you and render your cloaking ability completely useless.
Backstab your enemies: One of the primary associations made with the Spy is his ability to kill any enemy with one knife strike from behind.
Set your target priority: Going for "Personal Glory" and landing four backstabs in a row feels great, but may not be the most beneficial way to help your team.
Understand how your sapper works: Sappers slowly damage an Engineer's buildings (sentry guns, teleporters, and dispensers) and disable them, making them useless unless the Engineer removes the sapper in time.
What to do if discovered: Most of the time, if you are discovered, you are easily killed; however, in some situations you can spy yourself to safety.
Remember your revolver: While it can be tricky to aim, the revolver is still very powerful, and can be devastating if you get a critical hit.
Distract.
Sabotage and Thievery.
Know how sentry guns work.
One way is to crouch jump on top of the sentry without a disguise (using your Eternal Reward) and uncloak: the sentry takes a while to look up at you and shoot.
Know where to hide.
Know your watches: The Spy will start with his basic Invisibility Watch, rendering him completely cloaked.

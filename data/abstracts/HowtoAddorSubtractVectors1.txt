Express a vector in terms of components in some coordinate system usually x, y, and possibly z in usual 2 or 3 dimensional space (higher dimensionality is possible too in some mathematical situations).
To add two vectors, we simply add their components.
To subtract two vectors, subtract their components.

In general terms, A-B = <Ax-Bx,Ay-By,Az-Bz>
Let's subtract two vectors A and B.

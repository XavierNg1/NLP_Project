Put your drawing on the scanner.
Scan your picture.
Size your picture to your liking.
Go to Image > Adjust > Brightness Contrast and mess around with the sliders until the whites are whitest and the lines are black, make sure your lines are still soft though, if you are not satisfied with the results you may go to Image > Adjust > levels.

,
Erase any unwanted specs or dirt that were picked up by the scanner.

,
Clean the lines.
Use the Airbrush to color and shade since it's a very soft brush, make a new layer under your lines and color in what ever tone in overall image you'll be using.
Mess with the transparency bar until you get your desired results; be sure to use airbrush.

,
On a new layer, add the highlights and pink to his/her cheeks if you want, lower the transparency and add some more highlights (white dots etc.),
Go to the line art layer and select the little box that says 'preserve transparency' and color the lines a bit darker than the parts of the picture, ex: if the hair is blond color the hair lines light brown.
Clean up your drawing, sign it and you're done!

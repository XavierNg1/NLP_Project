Park the car in a clean, solid, well-lit place.
Loosen the lug nuts before jacking the car up (do not remove lug nuts yet).
Jack the car up with a sturdy jack on a solid surface (such as a floor jack if you have concrete to work on) and lower it very slowly and carefully onto jackstands.
Finish removing the wheels, and lay the wheels under the car, just to the rear of the jackstands.

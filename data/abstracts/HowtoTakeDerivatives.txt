Understand the definition of the derivative.
Understand the derivative notation.
Substitute (x+Δx){\displaystyle (x+\Delta x)} into the function.
Substitute the function into the limit.
Use the power rule when f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} is a polynomial function of degree n. Multiply the exponent with the coefficient and bring down the power by one.
Use the previous example.
Differentiate again.
Take the third derivative of the previous example f(x)=2x2+6x{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+6x}.

Use the quotient rule to take derivatives of rational functions.
Use the chain rule for nested functions.
Consider the function f(x)=(2x4−x)3{\displaystyle f(x)=(2x^{4}-x)^{3}}.

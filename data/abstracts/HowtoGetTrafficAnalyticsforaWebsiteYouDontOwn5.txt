For user-generated content/self-published content websites, look for statistics pages that include traffic and social data for items.
Look for monthly, quarterly, and annual review posts.
Look for information on pages created by the website for potential advertisers.The page typically has a URL of the form <domainname>/advertise or <domainname>/advertising
Some examples of websites that provide some traffic data are Reddit,BuzzFeed,Mashableand Dezeen.One downside is that the data is not automatically updated, and therefore provides only an estimate based on the time the page was updated.
Contact the website directly asking for data.
Use ad networks or ad planners that the website has hooked to.

Separate each switch from the others if they come to you as connected.
Start with the lowest value resistors, the 1 ohm resistors and solder them as as shown in the wiring diagram.

,
Connect one end of the resistor to pin 9 and the other end to pin 8 of the switch.
Check the performance of the single switch with the soldered resistors using an ohmmeter.Keep this switch aside,
Start on the 10 ohm switch connecting resistors between each pin as described above.
Do this for the remaining six switches.Solder a wire to pin 0 of all the switches.
Snap the 1 ohm switch to the 10 ohm switch to create a switch with 2 decades.

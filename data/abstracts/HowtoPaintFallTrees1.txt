Be sure to gather the colors that you wish to use, such as red, orange, yellow, and brown.
Get a thin brush, as this will assist you in painting in the details.
Get a canvas.
Start with using your wide brush and some dark brown paint in order to create the trunk.
Pour some red, yellow, or orange paint onto a paper plate or whatever disposable material you can use to hold paint.
Dab your brush onto the canvas towards the top of the tree.
Using your thin brush, getÂ a bit of brown paint onto the bristles.
Repeat all of the steps above, but in different parts of the canvas, until you have created your own forest of fall trees.

Finished.

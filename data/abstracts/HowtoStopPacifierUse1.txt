Slowly wean your child off the pacifier, like you did the bottle or the breast.
Choose the times of the day when your child is least likely to want their pacifier and remove it from sight.
Distract them with a snack or toy.
Gradually increase the times you refuse to give your child their pacifier until they no longer think about it.
Get your toddler used to the idea of sleeping without the pacifier before removing it from them for good.

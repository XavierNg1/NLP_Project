Listen to J Majik and Wickaman - Dubplate Killas


Then listen to TC - Where's My Money
Both of these tunes are in B-flat minor, or have Camelot mixing code 3A.
Cueing - How you go about cueing your tunes will depend largely on what medium you've chosen to DJ through.
NB - CD Mixing - unless you are in the privileged position of owning CDJ 1000's, which give you a vinyl-esque readout of the drops in a tune, it can be difficult to judge your drops by section.
Using these values can be useful for forward cueing a tune, for example if you want to drop a beat with a four 16bar section intro in quickly, you would search to 1.06 secs, then move around a bit until you find a cymbal or the end of a drum roll that usually signifies the start of a section.
Mixing - This is pretty much down to preference.

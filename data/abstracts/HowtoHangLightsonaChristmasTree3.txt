If you have an artificial tree, take it apart.
Put in the very bottom row of branches and light them up and down on each branch.
Assemble the middle of the tree, using the same method.
Keep moving up to the top, lighting up and down and back and forth to illuminate the tree.
Step back, take a look, and modify as necessary.

Find a dating site.
Remember that most of the sites will offer you a free trial period.
Register with honest information about yourself.
Remember never to give out personal information.
Make sure that when you connect with someone to keep the conversation on email for awhile.
Try to find out as much as possible about the other person, via email, so you can get a sense of what he is like.
Do not give out your phone number; instead, ask for his.
Be wary if he asks if you have a web cam.
When you talk to him on the telephone, and, after a bit of chit chat, he suddenly starts talking about sexual things, or asks you what you are wearing, hang up.
Some people don't like to chit-chat over email for long periods of time or give out their phone numbers.
When meeting him for the first time be sure to choose a public location, where there are plenty of people around, such as a restaurant or cafe near a busy street.

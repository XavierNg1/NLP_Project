Spend the remaining time working on steps 17-29.
Complete the horizontal columns.
On the back page, check off any diagnostic subsurface horizons identified in the profile.

,
Determine hydraulic conductivity of both the surface layer and the limiting layer.
Determine effective rooting depth by locating the horizon, if present, that restricts root growth.
Determine soil drainage class based on depth to redoximorphic features.

,
Indicate the parent material.
Write the depth of the beginning of the argillic horizon in the upper depth of the “particle size control section” if an argillic horizon is present.
Within the depth of the control section, average the clay percentages and rock fragment percentages to determine the family particle-size class.

,
Check the appropriate epipedon; almost all soils in this region have ochric epipedons.

,
Determine the soil order.
Fill out the “great group” using Dr. Needleman’s manual as a guide.

,
Fill out the site interpretations using the site interpretations sheet.
Calculate the water retention to 150 centimeter (59.1 in).
With any remaining time, double-check your work.

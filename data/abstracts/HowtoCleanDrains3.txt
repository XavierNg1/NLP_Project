Buy an inexpensive cable auger, or plumber's snake.
Remove the trap under the sink, if necessary.
Slowly push the auger cable or snake into the pipe opening.
Keep cranking the auger until you meet resistance.
Turn the crank the other way to withdraw the auger from the pipe.
Test your drain and repeat the process, if necessary.

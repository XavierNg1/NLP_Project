Train hard mentally and physically.
Before, during, and after a race, have good sportsmanship.
Set yourself up in a good position at the starting line so you can start ahead of the others.
While running, stay focused at what's ahead of you (the remaining distance and the finish line).
After you cross the finish line, first place or not, don't stop all of a sudden.

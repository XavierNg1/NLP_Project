Get all your gear together!,
Jump in front of the cage!,
Have someone warm you up by just passing the ball back and forth.
Make sure you follow with the other foot.

,
Keep your arms relaxed and away from and in front of your body, elbows slightly bent.

,
Bring your arms out as you step when catching the ball.

,
Clear the ball.
Create a right angle with the top arm and the stick over your dominant hand's shoulder to get the most distance.
Work in the pocket so that the ball won't bounce out when you block the shot.

,
Don't be afraid to come out of the crease!

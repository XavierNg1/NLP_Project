Don’t try so hard.
Laugh at yourself.
Be a goofball.
Pay attention to your appearance.
Smile.
Charm the people around you.
Speak a foreign language.
Be sexy, yet unattainable.
Ask her questions about herself.
Give her a genuine compliment.
Ask for her opinion.
Be a good listener.
Don’t flirt with everyone around you.
Give her a small gift.
Dance with her.
Use her name.
Give her a light touch.

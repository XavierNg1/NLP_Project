Start off by buying a few items from BVO (Bearville Outfitters).
Register a bear if you haven't already.
Buy doubles of items, as well as different colours, keeping one for yourself and one to trade.
Buy Halloween costumes during the Halloween season.
If you haven't already, begin trading.
Do not sell any items, especially exclusive ones.
Be patient.

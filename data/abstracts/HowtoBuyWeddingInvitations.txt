Start looking.
Make a list of friends and family to send invitations to.
Remember that it takes time to print the invitations (sometimes as little as two to three weeks, although it sometimes it takes as much as six) and it will take you an additional week or two to address the envelopes.
Know how to spell your fiance's and parent's names.
Proofread!,
Know these things in advance: Your parents’ preferred name-format (“Mr.& Mrs. John Smith" vs. “John and Jane Smith"); the spellings of names; wedding date and time; wedding location (address, building name); reception time(s), place(s), and date(s).

,
Choose font style, color, and size.
Don't include a registry card; this is considered a tacky and impolite gesture.
Buy your thank you at the same time as your invitations.
Consider RSVP cards, also called “response cards.
Decide how far in advance to send your invitations, based on where you're from and where your guests live.
Expect to purchase many, if not all, of these things from your stationer/printer: Announcements; Thank You Notes; Invitations & Envelopes; Ceremony Programs; Response Cards & Envelopes; Seating Cards; Save-the-Date Cards; Location Map; Napkins; Stationery

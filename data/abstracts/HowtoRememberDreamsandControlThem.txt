Buy a Dream Journal and put it near your bed with a pen beside it, both in reach.
Buy a tape recorder.
Relax when you sleep.
Listen to your tape recorder and read your dream book everyday.
Don't stop until you have a dream.
Prove it's a dream.

,
Ask in both the dream and real world,"Is this a dream?",
The world is at your command!

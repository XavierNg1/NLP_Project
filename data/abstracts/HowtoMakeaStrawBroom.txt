Gather it into bundles about 1 to 1 1/2 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) thick, wrapping each bundle tightly, and trimming the ends straight.
Using twine or wire, tie the bundles together, one at a time, and side by side.
Sharpen the end of your "handle" stick so that it can be pushed up into the end of your bundles at the center.
Using sharp, heavy duty scissors, or even tin snips, cut the ends of your straw straight across.

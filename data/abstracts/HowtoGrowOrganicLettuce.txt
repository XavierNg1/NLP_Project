Prepare the soil for planting.
Dig a trench in the soil, and plant the lettuce seeds.
Cover the seeds with .5 inch (1.3 cm) of soil.
Thin your plants once the seedlings have formed their first real leaves.
Harvest your organic lettuce when the outer leaves are about 6 inches (15.2 cm) long.
Keep pests at bay through organic methods.

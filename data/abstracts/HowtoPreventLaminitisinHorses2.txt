Check your horse's hooves every day and clean them with a hoof pick.
Have your farrier (horse shoer) trim your equine's feet every 6 to 8 weeks.
Add hoof supplements, such as biotin, to your horse's diet if the hooves are brittle and dry.
Avoid riding on rocky terrain if your horse doesn't have shoes on.
Consider having shoes put on at least the front feet of your horse to help protect the hooves when traveling along roads.

Camera housings are normally made of aluminum or more recently now from extremely durable specialty thermoplastics.
In climates where the weather can vary from bright sunlight to cold and damp there will need to be some form of heater mounted below the front glass plate or lower dome.
All material in front of the camera lens will attenuate the light and an allowance of at least one full f-stop should be used in calculating lighting and camera sensitivity.
If you mount a camera behind glass, for example in an outdoor housing, make sure that the lens is close to the external lens.

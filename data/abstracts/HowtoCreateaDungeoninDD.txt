First off, know your campaign setting - is it Forgotten Realmsâ„¢?,
Now that you know those things, you can think of a rough idea of what you want this dungeon to be like.
Now that you know that, you should start on the dungeon creation.
Build some settlements (at least one) relatively near the dungeon.
Think up maybe two notable NPCs in the village - people that the PCs can refer to when asking "so-what-are-we-supposed-to-watch-out-for?",
Next, draw a map of your dungeon.
Now, choose which monsters you want for the first three "musts.",
Now that you've chosen your monsters, place them in the dungeon and write up their stats.
Now, choose the treasure.
Now that you have done this, figure out the leftovers.
Now, find a group of players, schedule a time and place, and play.

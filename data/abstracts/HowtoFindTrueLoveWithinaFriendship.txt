Be considerate, caring and thoughtful towards the person.
Spend a plenty of time with them.
Help them out once in a while.
Have a laugh with them - crack jokes when together and let your walls come down, in other words be open.
Eye contact is critical.
If you two become close and find love with each other, be caring, loving and friendly.

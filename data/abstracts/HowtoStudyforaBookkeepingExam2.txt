This method is for those students who have insufficient time to prepare for open book exams.
Collect your Resources: Get your textbook, related reference materials and class notes (if you have any).
Familiarize the Test Portion: Know your syllabus and tick the chapters for the exam.
Start Reading (R): Start reading your slides and notes to get a brief review about the concepts and formulas involved.
Take Notes (N): Here notesâ€™ taking is very much different from the one in Method-1.
Revise (R): Now as you have organized your preparation, simply workout the old or previous year question papers.

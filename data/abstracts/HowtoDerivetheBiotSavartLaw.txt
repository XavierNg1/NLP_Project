Begin with the definition of the vector potential.
Rewrite Ampere's law in terms of potentials to obtain Poisson's equation.
Solve Poisson's equation.
Take the curl of A{\displaystyle {\mathbf {A} }}.
Use the product rule ∇×(fv)=∇f×v+(∇×v)f{\displaystyle \nabla \times (f{\mathbf {v} })=\nabla f\times {\mathbf {v} }+(\nabla \times {\mathbf {v} })f} to simplify the above expression.

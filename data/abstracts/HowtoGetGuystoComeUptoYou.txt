Be yourself.
Appear confident and believe in yourself.
Look after yourself well.
Wear makeup.
Introduce yourself.
Try the good old "Can you lend me a pen" trick and start off a conversation yourself.
Talk to this guy regularly.
Help him out if he's struggling with something he can't understand but you can.
Try to do the same activities that the guy is interested in like dancing or take the classes that he is taking so that you bump into each other often.
Feel blessed if you have a common friend who knows both you and him well.
Judge when he seems interested and let things unfold.
Don't push things.
Enjoy the relationship if it sparks.

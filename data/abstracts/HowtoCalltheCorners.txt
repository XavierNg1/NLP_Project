Clarify your intentions.
Prepare your tools.
Clear the space, mentally and physically.
Light the candles in a circle, and figure out where your corners are.
Walk "deasil" (clockwise) around the circle of candles a few times, allowing your mental space to clear.
Face the East and say something along the lines of "Guardians of the East, I call upon you to bless this rite and guard this circle.",
Stand in the centre of the circle and conclude with an acknowledgment of the Spirit.

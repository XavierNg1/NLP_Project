Create a 2 Accounts Receivable account in the COA called “Factor AR.” Any invoices that are to be given to the Factor have to be created out of this AR account.
On a daily basis you will be able to get a Cash Receipts report from the Factor to see which invoices had been paid by the customer.
Now, when lump sums of money are received from the Factor, all that needs to be done is make a deposit in QuickBooks depositing the money into the checking account and choosing “ Due from Factor ” as the From Account .

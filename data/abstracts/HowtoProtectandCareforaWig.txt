When you need to comb a wig, be gentle.
While you're sitting at home, take it off and put it on a wig stand.
After washing a wig, do not shake it in a towel.
After saturating your wig in water, squeeze it dry.
While washing your hair, never use shampoo meant for natural hair.
You can condition your hair every couple weeks or so, to keep it shiny and soft.
Only wash your wig after wearing it for 25 times.

Look for an increased number of sigma bonds to identify addition reactions.
Look for an increased number of pi bonds to indicate elimination reactions.
Notice any molecular “swapping” to single out substitution reactions.
Spot rearrangement reactions when the product has the same formula as the original molecule.
Consider other important reactions that can affect organic molecules.
Identify electrophiles in organic chemistry reaction mechanisms.
Identify nucleophiles in organic chemistry reaction mechanisms.
Remember that nucleophiles attack electrophiles in organic reactions.
Get familiar with other foundations of organic chemistry.
Read the book before you come to class.
Make notecards for different organic reactions.
Study organic chemistry each and every day of the semester.
Spend time studying in a group.
Take practice problems seriously.

Know the types of stains, and what they do:

Oil-based stains provide long lasting wood tone color.
Put your rubber gloves on.
Using a sponge, brush, rag or clean cloth, apply stain to wood generously.








,
Make sure you work in one continuous movement across your wood, going with the grain.
Wait 5 to 15 minutes for stain to absorb.
When you are satisfied with the stain color, place the piece(s) on something flat (workbench, garage floor) and let dry for 6 to 8 hours.

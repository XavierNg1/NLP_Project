Transfer the thin pieces of dough onto 2 large baking sheets.
Bake the dough in the oven for 15 to 25 minutes at 300ºF (150ºC) or until the wafers are crisp and dry.
Allow the poppadoms to cool completely.
Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat.
Place 1 or 2 poppadoms into the oil and turn them over when the edges begin to curl.
Remove the poppadoms before they begin to brown.
Place your homemade poppadoms onto paper towels while you continue cooking the rest.
Serve.

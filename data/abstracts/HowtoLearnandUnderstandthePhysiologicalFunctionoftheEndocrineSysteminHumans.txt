The endocrine system of humans is composed of several glands that have communications with a master endocrine gland which is called the pituitary gland.
These mechanisms are mostly autonomic in nature and are controlled by loops between the pituitary gland and the other endocrine glands.
The secretion of hormones by the various endocrine glands is controlled by the secretion of regulatory hormones that are secreted by the master gland, the pituitary gland.
High level of the TSH hormone will initially cause an increase in the secretion of the thyroid hormone (TH).
All the endocrine glands that are spread in the body are under the direct control and regulation by hormones of the pituitary gland.
Both of these hormones are regulated by the degree of osmolality of the blood plasma and by the status of blood volume in the arteries.
Usually high blood volume signals the decrease of secretion of both of these hormones to the blood circulation.
The secretion of this hormone usually signals the kidney to conserve water to the blood.
This hormone is regulated by the level of water or blood in the arteries and by the degree of osmolality of the blood.
This structure of the brain controls the hormonal secretions by the pituitary gland through the release to the blood of releasing hormones that control by a mechanism of positive feedback the secretion of the hormones by the pituitary gland.

Prepare two lengths of rope by binding or melting them at the ends.
Lay the rope flat on the ground, and make an overhand loop around 15 inches (38 cm) from the top-end of your rope.
Pull the standing part through the overhead loop.
Insert a wooden rung into the new loop formed by the standing part and tighten the rope.
Repeat the process on the other length of rope.
Start the next overhand loop anywhere from 9 to 15 inches (23 to 38cm) from the previous wooden rung.
Secure your ladder at the top.
Secure your ladder at the bottom.

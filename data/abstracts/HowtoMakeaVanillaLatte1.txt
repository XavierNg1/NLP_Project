Brew 2 ounces (30 milliliters) of espresso according to the directions on your espresso machine.
Pour the espresso into a large mug.
Stir in the vanilla syrup.
Pour cold milk into a steaming pitcher and heat it to 145째F to 165째F (65째C to 70째C) using the steaming wand on your espresso machine.
Raise the steaming wand tip just above the surface of the milk to create foam.
Push the steaming wand further into the milk to finish heating the milk once you have made enough foam for one to two spoonfuls.
Pour the steamed milk into the cup, using a spoon to hold back the froth.
Add one or two spoonfuls of foam on top.
Add some garnish, if desired, and serve.

Bleed the brakes.
Use break cleaner to clean up any grease from fingers/skin and any break fluid that may have gotten onto the rotor or pads during installation.
Put the wheels back on the car to hold the rotor on straight, if it is the easy removal kind of rotor (separate from the hub).

,
Do not let the car down from the jackstands yet.

,
Remove the rubber cap from the hollow bleeder screw, and unscrew the bleeder screw about 1/4 or 1/2 turn.
Have your assistant slowly depress the brake pedal until it's at the floor and keep there until you tell them to let it back up.
Repeat the process of pressing the peddle down, closing the screw, letting up, loosening, return to pressing the peddle down, etc... until you see clean brake fluid (without bubbles) coming out of the bleeder.
Make sure the brake fluid reservoir does not run empty while bleeding the brakes.

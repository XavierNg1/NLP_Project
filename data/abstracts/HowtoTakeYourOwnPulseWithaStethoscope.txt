Purchase a stethoscope if you do not already have one.
You will also need something to keep track of time with in seconds.
To take your pulse, you will be listening to your heart through your chest.
Place the earpieces in your ears.
The piece that goes on your chest is called the chestpiece.
To position the chestpiece on your chest, find the imaginary line between your nipples.
Get your timepiece ready to watch; we are now ready to count your heart beat for a given time period.
Look at the second hand on your watch/clock, and when the second hand hits one of the 5 minute markers start counting the beats through your scope.
If you counted for an entire minute you are all set and have your pulse, but in most cases we now need to do a little math because pulse values are expressed in beats per minute (BPM).
All done.

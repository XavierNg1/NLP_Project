Wet a skewer or popsicle stick with water and roll it in granulated sugar.
Hold the skewer in the middle of the glass so that it is not touching the sides and the tip does not touch the bottom of the glass.
Pinch the dry end of the skewer with the clothespin and rest the clothespin across the top of the glass.
Place the glass somewhere safe, where it will remain undisturbed.
Wait one to two weeks for your rock candy to be ready.
Finished.

Check the snow condition.
Roll a (very) large ball of snow, just as you would for building a snowman.
Set the large snowball with the flattest side facing up.
Make one last snowball for the penguin's head.
Currently, this structure resembles a traditional snowman.
Add the penguin's feet.
Craft the penguin's wings.
Now create the beak.
Gently scoop away some of the excess snow used to cement the beak, and smooth the rest so that the beak flows naturally into the head.
Make a tail.
Add facial features to your snow penguin.
Take a snapshot of your unique snow sculpture.
Finished.

Determine what your AC input voltage is.
Find the voltage and amperage needed to power the components of your electronic device.
Use a transformer to step down the output from high-voltage AC to low-voltage AC.
Run the low-voltage AC through a rectifier.
Add a large electrolytic capacitor to smooth out the voltage.
Pass the output of the smoother through a regulator.

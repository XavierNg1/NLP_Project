Buy a pencil case.
Take all of your things and identify them.
Fill up your case.
Whenever you are done using a pencil/pen put it right back in your pencil case.
If you happen to lose one stay calm.
If you don't find it, that's fine.
Every month, clean out your pencil case and refresh it with new stuff.
Try not to loan out pencils.

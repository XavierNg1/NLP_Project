See what permission you want to change.
Decide what permission you want to change: either the USER access, the GROUP access, or OTHER access.
Notice letters on the permission line in picture 1.
Notice that there are 3 numbers in the octal/number code.
Change the permission on folders by using the same command for files.
After you type in the chmod command with the proper numbers, check to see if you have successfully completed the command by using the ls â€“l command.
If you are unsure of how to fix your mistakes, log into your root account and change the permissions on the file or directory to 777 when using the chmod command, which will return read write and execute permissions to everyone.

Now that you know the basics of how to change file permissions in Linux, play around with the permission to see what changes when you try to open a file or folder or try to move the file and see what results you obtain.
Have fun (Linux if always fun).

Obtain a good, realistic venue.
Consider hiring an event planner if you can afford to do so.
If possible, try to contact your guest of honor's high school and find out things like the school colors, the theme of the prom for the year (s)he would have gone, and maybe see if you can borrow one of the leftover tickets (some schools keep these on file or as keepsakes) to make reproductions of.

,
Make sure you budget enough for a crown and tiara (for the prom king and prom queen), and make sure your guest of honor is crowned king/queen.
Make a yearbook.
Try to make the prom as close to what it would have been like the year your guest of honor graduated high school.
Try to get a few of your guest of honor's best friends, from high school, college, and/or now, etc.
Arrange to rent a limo to pick up your guest of honor and his/her date - whether this is a current significant other or an arranged date.

,
Make sure your guest of honor has a date for the event.

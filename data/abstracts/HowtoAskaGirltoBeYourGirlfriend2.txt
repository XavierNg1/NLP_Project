Befriend her.
Ask her to spend time with you in a pressure-free setting.
Consider giving her a small, inexpensive gift.Unless you frequently throw gifts her way, a gift lets the girl know that there is something different—and special—about your time together this day when compared to any other day.
Tell her seriously how you feel.
Accept her answer calmly.

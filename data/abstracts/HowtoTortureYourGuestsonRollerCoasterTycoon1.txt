Begin or load a previous park.
Go to/ make a lake, and build an island in the middle of it.
Build a gentle ride, a thrill ride, and a roller coaster.
Since many people will be upset because they are trapped on the island, your rating will go down, and people still on the mainland will leave.
When you get bored, gradually remove the path until they are all stuck on one square.
Start again, and have fun!

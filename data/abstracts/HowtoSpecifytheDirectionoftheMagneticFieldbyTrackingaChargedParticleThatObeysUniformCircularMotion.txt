 Identify the path of the charged particle.
 Consider three parameters: The velocity of the charged particle (v{\displaystyle v}), the magnetic field the particle is moving within (B{\displaystyle B}), and the force acting upon the particle by the magnetic field (F{\displaystyle F}).
,
 Represent the three parameters by vectors.
Use the Right Hand Rule to determine the direction of magnetic field vector.
 Consider the charge.

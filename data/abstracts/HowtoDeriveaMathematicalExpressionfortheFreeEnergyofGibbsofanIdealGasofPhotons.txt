Use a derivation of the equation of an ideal gas of photons based on the recent theory of photons that are related through an equation of forces and velocities of light photons.
By using the ideal gas law PV=nRT, one can isolate V in terms of the other components so that one has the following expression:


V=nRT/P

,
By substituting this value of V into the equation of dG one gets:


dG=nRT*dP/P

,
By integrating both sides of the equation one gets the following formula for G:


G = nRT*ln(P2/P1)

,
We know, however, from previous work the following equation: F1*L=nRT*ln(V2/V1), that we can change the Pressure function in the mathematical expression for G to the volume using the ideal gas equation:


PV=nRT

,
By doing so the mathematical expression for G looks now like this:


G = nRT*ln(V1/V2)

,
We want now to write the expression of G in terms of parameters of the photon equation of forces.

,
By doing so one gets the following mathematical expression:


G = -F1*L

Figure out a game that everyone agrees on, and make sure it is "tournament approved".
Some examples of "tournament approved" games: Guitar Hero (the oldest one you should use can only be Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock), Call of Duty (Modern Warfare, World at War, or Modern Warfare 2), Rock Band, Mario Kart (no older than the GameCube version), FIFA, and Halo.

Pick a cool song, learn how to play it, and also learn how to sing it.

,
Play the song with the record and try to at least hum the lyrics.

,
Keep practicing the song until you can play it without the record and with your eyes closed.
Play the song, but DO NOT think about the chords, fingerings, or anything else; just play.
Well, practice this and have fun!

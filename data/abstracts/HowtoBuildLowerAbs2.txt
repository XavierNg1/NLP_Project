Start by laying flat on a mat and resting your arms parallel to the floor, palms down.
In a slow, steady and controlled movement, use the strength of the lower abdominals to bring the knees close to the chest so that your butt lifts slightly off the ground.
Slowly release to the starting position and repeat.

Check that the bike is laterally trued first, as best as you can get it.
Spin the rim and watch it from the side, noting any high spots using calipers or your fingers.
Tighten the two spokes that are on either side of the rubbing area with a half turn.
Move the calipers, pen, or your finger closer in, spin the wheel, and adjust as needed.
Check that parts of the wheel don't dive inwards now, making flat spots, and loosen as necessary.

Prepare yourself before answering the phone call.
Stay calm throughout.
Use kind language.
Allow the telemarketer to complete their initial speech.
Tell them you aren't interested.
Try practicing the “three nos” rule.
Let them know they are not welcome to call you in the future.
End the call politely.
Know when telemarketers are allowed to call you.
Use their own rules against them.
Register your number on-line with the Federal Do Not Call List (http://www.donotcall.gov).Since 2005, telemarketers are required by law to register their lists here and check their lists against consumers who have used the list to opt-out.
Be wary of fraudulent calls.

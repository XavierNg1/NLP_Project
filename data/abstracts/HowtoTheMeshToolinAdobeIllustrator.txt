Select different swatches of blue for the mesh cloud.
Using the third blue from your swatch box (or any blue, for that matter), create a graphic cloud.
From your pathfinder's tool (or box) click unite to merge the circles together.
Select the fourth blue and your mesh tool.
Now that you have mesh cloud, start experimenting with the different variations of blue to create different kinds of colors on the cloud.
Click on your first yellow (the darker yellow) and then your mesh tool.
You now have an artwork illustrating the sky with the clouds and the sun using the mesh tool.

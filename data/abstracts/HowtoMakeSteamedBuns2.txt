Reserve two tablespoons of the flour mixture as this will be used later to prevent the buns from sticking to the counter when you roll them out.

Add 1C sugar to the flour mixture, stir well, and then slowly pour the 1 cup of milk into the dry ingredients, alternating with mixing by hand and pouring until all the milk is incorporated with the flour.
Add the one tablespoon of oil to the dough, and then knead for another 10 minutes.
Remove the dough from the bowl and cut in half, and then in half again, until you have 12 balls of dough on the counter.
Place some of the reserved flour on the counter and roll each ball of dough to a thickness of about one-quarter inch.
Put a disc of dough in the palm of your hands, and place some of the red bean paste onto it, making sure not to use too much because you might stretch the dough while trying to seal the buns.
Seal the bun.
Put a piece of parchment paper (or foil) on the bottoms of each bun and arrange buns on a plate until you have enough to begin steaming your first batch.
Arrange buns in steamer, close lid, and steam for 20 minutes.
Cooling the buns is optional, but eating them is mandatory.

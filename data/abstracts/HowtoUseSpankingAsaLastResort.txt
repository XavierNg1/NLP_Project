Sit down and talk with your child.
When the child misbehaves and/or commits one of the behaviors that you deemed serious enough to possibly warrant a spanking, put the child in time-out.
Once you are calm, think about the best consequence for the offense.
If you decide to not spank the child, have a discussion with the child about the misbehavior and then announce what the consequence will be.
If you decide a spanking is necessary, have a discussion with the child about the misbehavior and then announce that the consequence will be a spanking.

Pull down the child's pants and underwear.
Bend your child over your knee.
Relax your hand and all your limbs, with one firm hand on their back and one on their bottom.
Begin spanking.
If the child is squirming and struggling during the spanking, apply more pressure with your hand on the child's back to help hold him down.

Know when to stop.
After the spanking, comfort and reassure the child that the spanking is over and that you still love them more than they could possibly imagine.
After they calm down, have a brief talk with them.
Hug the child more, and give them another kiss.

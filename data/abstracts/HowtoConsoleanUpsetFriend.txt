Just listen.

Don't play psychiatrist (you're really no better than Dr.
Don't say that you "get" it.
Leave them alone if they want private time.
Ask them straight-up how you can help.
Bust them up with some light humor.

Check in on them with regular calls, texts, and visits.
Just be there, even if you don't know what to do.

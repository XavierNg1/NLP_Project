Identify power weapons and their locations on each map.
When playing a multiplayer match, ALWAYS begin with a strategy that will allow you, or someone on your team, to acquire all the Power Weapons on the map.
Know the maps - Know all the popular hiding spaces, the 'newb highways', the vehicle spawns, the power weapon spawns, interactive gates, man-cannon jumps etc.
Communicate - When you are in a team, talk-talk-talk.
Team Work - If you see a friend and enemy fighting, make it a priority to help.
Vehicles - If playing a very good team, either your entire team needs to be in them, of don't touch them at all.

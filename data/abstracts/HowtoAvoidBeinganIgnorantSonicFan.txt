Always know what you're talking about.
Never blindly hate on a game.
Under no circumstances should you ever join a shipping war.
Don't bash others for their opinions.
Don't "attack" younger or newer Sonic fans for not being as knowledgeable as you.
If you are trying to explain to a non-fan of Sonic what it's all about, don't stray into a side universe.

Open Photoshop and create a new document 220px width and 100px height (note we are using 72px/inch).
We are going to use the rounded rectangle tool.
Next we want to apply the nice gradient overlay.
Now we want to have a nice glow effect on the button as though it is lighted from the borders.
Add a simple background so we can see our hard work.
Add a nice border that actually flows with the button.
Now time for the pattern effect on the button.
To define your own custom shape, just go to Edit > Define Pattern and name it Stripes.

,
Time to apply our custom pattern to the button, go back to the tab with your button on it.
Lets get the glow, to do this we use a simple radial gradient and then make it fit the shape of the button.
After press enter to confirm the transformation.
To give our text that nice stamped feel we will be using a clever trick with the shadow.
To finish our masterpiece of button sexiness we just need a nice reflection.
Click Ctrl and T to then transform and move the new button down so it looks upside down.
Congratulations!

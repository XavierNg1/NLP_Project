Make sure it's clear where you are going, how long you will be gone, what the weather will be like, and how you are getting there.
Get a piece of paper and a pen or pull up a blank document on your computer.
Decide if you want to use bullets or create a list for each item (Clothing List, Bathroom List, Entertainment List, etc).
Start with clothing.
Move on to Bathroom Items.
Now, start writing down Entertainment items.
You also need to remember Sleeping items.
Next, start writing down Cleaning items.
Now, write down financial/identification items.
Start writing down medications and other items for your health.
Now you can write down some 'gadgets' you need to take.
If you are camping or spending time outdoors like on the beach or in swimming pools, add an Outdoor items section.
This last section is only needed if you are traveling with the family or with young children.
Add any other items you need for your trip, like pens and pencils, notebooks, GPS (for traveling), or rags.

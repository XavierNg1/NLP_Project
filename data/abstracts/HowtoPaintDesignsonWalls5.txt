Gather your supplies.
Start by applying painter's tape to your wall in a design you find pleasing.
Smooth the tape down with your fingers or a straight edge.
Pour some wall paint out onto a paint pan.
Dip the paint roller into the paint pain and tap off any excess paint onto a folded paper towel.
Gently roll the paint roller across your entire wall.
Pull the painter's tape off as soon as your are done painting.

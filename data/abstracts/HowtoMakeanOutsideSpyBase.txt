Talk with your child and discover what they think they need in the "Spy Base".
Gather the wood and other materials needed to build the base.
A spy base needs four walls, a secret entrance, an observation platform, and a way to view outside to see if dangerous enemy spies are present.

,
Have your James Bond or Nancy Drew choose the location (in your backyard).
Build a simple framework to attach the walls to.
Attach the walls to the frame, except on one side.
The remaining side should have a hidden door.
Place a roof on top of the structure that will keep out the weather but allow observation or the launching of missiles (water balloons).
Build a platform inside the base that will allow "observations" through the top of the base.
Drill holes in the walls to allow those inside to monitor if enemy spies are approaching.

,
Such a building can also be built entirely makeshift.

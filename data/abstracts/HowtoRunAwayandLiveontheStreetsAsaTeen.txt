Consider your options carefully.
Find a place to stay.
Be prepared to answer questions.
Practice answering common questions.
Consider leaving a note telling your parents/guardians that you have left and why you have left, so then they know that you haven't been abducted.
Don't just leave, read the "Things You'll Need" section below, and take as many of those things you can and anything you think will help.

,
Keep in mind the prime times to get away.
Search for a stable job and living arrangement.
Bring money and a backpack with lots of change, extra clothes, a toothbrush, toothpaste, a hairbrush, a cloth, shampoo and a hat/umbrella.

,
Mobile phones can be useful, but it is a good idea to change your phone number and/or SIM card because they can be used to track you.

,
Don't bring a credit/debit card.
Remember to take a mat, a sleeping bag or some cardboard to lie on when you sleep otherwise your back muscles can tear and almost freeze, and it will also keep you warmer.
Needle and thread can help a lot when you're on the streets to patch up torn and damaged clothes and to sew buttons onto clothes.
Bring a tarp or poncho to keep yourself dry during the night.

,
Take care of your hygienic needs in a private bathroom, such as washing your hair in the sink, brushing your teeth, and washing your body with hand soap and a cloth.
Keep most of your paper money, ID card, social security card and credit card, in your underwear.
Remember to eat and drink; don't get dehydrated.
Go to a church, mission, internet cafe or public library for warmth.

,
Never admit that you have any money.
Don't waste money on cigarettes or alcohol.
If you are choosing to run away permanently, cut and dye your hair a natural colour that won't attract attention.
Panhandle for extra money.
(Remember, running away can ruin your life...only do so if you are desperate) And if you are think of how your family will react and feel if you run away.

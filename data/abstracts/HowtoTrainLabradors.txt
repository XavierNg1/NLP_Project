Teach a Labrador Retriever his name as soon as you bring him home.
Speak the dog's name before giving any command.
Keep your Labrador Retriever's obedience lessons brief.
Acclimate the Labrador to new experiences by walking him while leashed in areas where he will encounter strangers and hear new sounds.
Make sure the Labrador Retriever is "surface trained" to safely escape emergency situations.

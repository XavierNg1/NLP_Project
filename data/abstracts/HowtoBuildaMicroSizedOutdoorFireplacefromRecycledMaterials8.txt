Place one pellet on the grate towards the back of the firebox (but not touching the wall).

,
Open the damper all of the way.
Light the pellet with a lighter or match.
Once the pellet has been fully engulfed for a minute, carefully add a second pellet.
Add a third pellet two or three minutes after the second, but sooner if the flames seem to by dying down.
After the third pellet is burning well, slowly close the damper to about halfway and watch the reaction.
When you choose to stop feeding your fire, the last pellet will burn itself out into a glowing ember.

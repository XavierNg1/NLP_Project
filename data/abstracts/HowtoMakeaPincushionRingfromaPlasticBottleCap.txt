Make two holes with a push pin as shown.


Pass a string through the holes.

Cut cloth into a circle of about 2.5 times of diameter of cap's diameter.

Make a stitch just inside the edge, all the way around.


Wrap a cotton ball in the circle, then tighten the thread by pulling on the needle so that it wraps around the cotton securely.


Glue the cushion to the bottle cap.

Wear your new pincushion on your finger and use it!

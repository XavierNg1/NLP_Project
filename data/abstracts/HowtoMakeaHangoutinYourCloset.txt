First, get all of your supplies together (see things you need);
,
Next,take out ALL of your stuff from your closet.
Now, make a pile of things you want to keep, and things you want to throw away or give to charity.
Think of all the things you want to put in your closet but DON'T ORGANIZE YET!!!,
Now, lay down the blankets and pillows.
Now, take books, drawing pads, origami/writing paper, and other things you want to fill your closet with and start to think where your things should go.
Hang up posters around you and over you.
Clean up the pile of things you wanted to keep.
Now climb into your sanctuary and turn up that iPod and relax!

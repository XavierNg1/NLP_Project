Say “Louie.” If you're going for the basic English pronunciation of "Louis Vuitton", the first word is a piece of cake.
Say “Vit.” The second word, "Vuitton" looks a little more intimidating, but it's not actually very hard to pronounce in English.
Say “Tahn.” Next, to finish "Vuitton", make a "tahn" (rhymes with "brawn") sound for the second syllable.
Put it all together!,
Optionally, end with the French “Toh”.

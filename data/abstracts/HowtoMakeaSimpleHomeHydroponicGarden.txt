Cut out a piece of plywood measuring 1x1.5m, and 2.5cm thick.
Cut two pieces of lumber 15x150cm, and 5cm thick.
Get seven 1/2cm deck screws.
Screw the frame down onto the plywood.
Use standard 6 millimetre black plastic to hold the water.
Place the plastic in the box, smoothing it out perfectly.
Add wire.
Take a 2cm circumference pipe, 10cm long and place it through the plastic and the wood holes.
Done.
Take 5kg's of charcoal and sift through it for nails with a decently powerful magnet.
Rinse all of the charcoal thoroughly to just clean it off for the plants.

,
Leave the charcoal out to dry for about a day in direct sunlight while being stirred occasionally.

,
Once dried, the charcoal is ready to go into the bed, and you are finished with this part.

,
Make the trace mix solution.
Make an iron chelate solution.
Take a 5L container, and fill it up with 4L of hard water.
Take the second 5L container and fill it up with 4L of hard water.
Understand that the reason you make two solutions (Mix 1 and Mix 2) is to avoid certain chemicals from reacting with each other over time.
Use your nutrient solutions.
Plant the plants you desire in the charcoal bed.
Water your plants a couple times a day and they will be strong and healthy.

,
Wash the beds out.
Allow the charcoal to dry in the sun while stirring it occasionally.

,
Repeat this entire cycle for clean efficient food.

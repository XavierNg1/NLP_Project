Once mixed, cover cocktail sauce with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator.
Decide whether to cook with fresh or frozen shrimp.
Cook shrimp with their shells if possible.

Remove the shrimp from the ice bath with a slotted spoon and drain off thoroughly.
Assemble your shrimp, with or without shell, next to your bowl of homemade cocktail sauce.

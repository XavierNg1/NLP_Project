Draw a long, slightly curved line.
Draw another one below, more intensely curved.
Add another intensively curved line, this is the top eyelid.

,
Draw the "circle" of the eye, this consists of the iris (the outer ring) and the pupil (the black in the middle).
Draw the eyelashes.
Draw the baseline for the eyebrow.
Add two circles - one on the iris and one on the pupil, to achieve the effect of the light reflection.
Add another short, curved line below and left of the inner corner, this is the line of the nose.

,
Now fill in the eyebrow, using a great number of short, curved motions; this way it will look like actual hair.
If you want to make your eye look like it has makeup applied, color the top eyelid (eyeshadow effect), and darken the edges just below the eyelashes (eyeliner effect).

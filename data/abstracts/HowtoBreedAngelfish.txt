Set up a freshwater aquarium large enough to prepare breeding angelfish.
Test the pH of your water.
Set the water temperature.
Put a good filter in your aquarium.
Feed your angelfish properly.
Sex your angels to isolate a breeding pair.
Use other common characteristics to sex your angelfish.
Alternately, purchase a breeding pair.
If keeping more than two angelfish, wait for breeding males and females to pair off.
Isolate any breeding pairs in a separate spawning tank.
Wait for your breeding pair to spawn.
If all else fails, pair the angels up with different mates.
Let the angelfish rear their own fry if desired.
Raise the fry artificially if you need to.
Wait for the fry to hatch after about 60 hours in 80Â° F. At this stage, they'll be simple wrigglers, and won't need to eat anything.

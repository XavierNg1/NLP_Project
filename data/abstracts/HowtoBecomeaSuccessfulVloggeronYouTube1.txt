Be yourself.
Consider your audience.
Don't hide emotions in your videos.
Surround yourself with positive people.
Consider the relationship you're in.
When you first start your vlogs, don't expect to gain one million subscribers in one day.
Don't compare your subscribers to massive YouTubers.
Invest time and effort into vlogging because you are passionate about it.

Ask your teacher in advance anything you may not remember or know about actual recital day, such as the setup of the theater, dress rehearsals, make up guidelines, or other things you'll need to clarify.
Make sure that you have all of your dance costumes.
Make sure your dance clothing is clean.
Pack your makeup.
Make sure you don't forget anything, like dance shoes, extra hair nets, bobby pins, a brush, hairspray, gel, or the correct undergarments.
Get to the theater an hour and a half or so before the show to assure yourself a spot by the mirror (or otherwise instructed by your teacher).
Bring an iPod, some healthy food, a drink, and anything else to entertain yourself with because you will be there for a long time.
Have fun!,
Dance like nobody's watching!

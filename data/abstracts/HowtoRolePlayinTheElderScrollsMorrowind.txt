Think of a general character personality in which you would enjoy getting involved.
Think of the physical character that would fit that personality.
Pick and design your character's race, class, attributes, etc.
Think of a name for your character that fits the stats you have chosen and feels right within the Elder Scrolls world.
Now, the fun part: design your character's background.
Decide how you will play your new character.
The hard part: follow through with your self-made decisions.

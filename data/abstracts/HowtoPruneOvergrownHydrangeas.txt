Pay attention to which stems your hydrangea is producing flowers on.
Prune hydrangeas growing on old wood in the summer, no later than August.
Prune hydrangeas growing on new wood while they are dormant during the fall or winter.
Prune dead and diseased stems right back to the ground and dispose of them.
Disinfect the pruners with a household disinfectant like Lysol before and after using them.
Cut one-third of the oldest, thickest stems off at the ground and throw them away.
Use hand pruners to cut each stem just below where it is tied.

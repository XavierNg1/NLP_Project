Be excited!,
Pay attention at orientation.
On the first day, meet up with old friends.
Don't be late to class.
Try to act like you belong, but don't overdo it.
If your school has a big-brothers/big-sisters policy where freshmen are paired with seniors, make use of it.
Don't offend the seniors.
Try a lot of clubs and activities, but not every one of them.
Go to the Homecoming game and dance.
Participate in school bake sales, musicals, craft fairs, or anything you're allowed to.

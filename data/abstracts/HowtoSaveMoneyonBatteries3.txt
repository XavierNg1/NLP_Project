Follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding installation of the cell that powers the multimeter.

,
Remove all of the cells for which you need to measure the voltage, from the device that is no longer working.
Measure the “direct current voltage” or DCV of the suspect cells.
Turn the dial of the multimeter to the 2V selection in the DCV area on the face of the multimeter.
Use the red and black test leads; make sure they are connected to the multimeter.
Connect the test leads to the appropriate battery ends.
Note the voltage reading in the display panel.
Turn it off.

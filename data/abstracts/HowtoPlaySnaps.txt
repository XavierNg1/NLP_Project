Choose the name of a person that you want the receiver to guess.
Decide if you want to give the receiver the exact name or the clue to the name.
Figure out good consonant statements and a clear clue to the name, if necessary.
Clue your receiver about the word to be snapped.
Give the first letter to the receiver.
Give the second letter.
Follow the same pattern for the rest of the letters.
Guess the person’s name or clue.
Pay attention to the snapper’s first line.
Listen closely to the first statement or series of snaps.
Follow this pattern until the snapper finishes the name or the clue.
Guess the name or the clue to the name.

Place a 9 by 12 inch (22.86 by 30.48 centimeters) baking pan into the freezer 30 minutes before you start making the lemonade.
Combine the sugar, lemon juice, and 2 cups (475 milliliters) of water in a pitcher.
Pour the lemonade into the pan, and freeze it for 90 minutes, stirring it half hour.
Whisk in the remaining 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water, and give the lemonade a taste.
Pour the frozen lemonade into a blender, and blend until smooth.
Pour the frozen lemonade into tall glasses, and serve.

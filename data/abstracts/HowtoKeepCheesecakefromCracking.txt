Mix lightly.
Consider adding a starch to the batter.
Add the eggs last.
Rest the pan in a water bath.A warm water bath keeps the moisture in the oven high, but more importantly, it prevents the cheesecake from getting too hot during the cooking process.
Bake at a low temperature.
Consider turning off the heat early.
Test doneness with an instant-read thermometer.
Do not over-bake the cheesecake.
Run a knife along the edge of the pan.
Cool the cheesecake slowly.
Finished.

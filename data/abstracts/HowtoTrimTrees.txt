Wait until the right time of year to trim trees.
Gather the necessary tools and equipment.
Decide which branches to remove.
Trim starting at the bottom of the tree and move upward and from the inside and move outward.
Cut right above where the branch or new growth attaches to the trunk or main branch.This area is called the branch collar or abscission zone.
Use a handheld pruner to trim new growth and small branches you can reach from the ground or safely from a ladder.

,
Make selective cuts to reduce the tree's size without dramatically altering its natural shape.
When removing large branches first make a cut on the underside of the branch( a foot away from the trunk) Cut 1/3 of the way through from the bottom of the branch to the top of the branch without pinching the saw.

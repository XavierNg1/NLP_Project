Purchase a mushroom growing kit from your local gardening supply store.
Immerse the mushroom block in a container of cold water.
Allow the block to soak for several hours.
Place the container in a dark, cool spot.
Harvest your crop of mushrooms.
Let the sawdust block rest for a week and then repeat the process.
Reuse the sawdust block each week until you are no longer getting a good harvest.
Toss the sawdust block in your compost pile when it no longer produces mushrooms.

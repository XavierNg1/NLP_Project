First, you will need a tank.
Next you will need a substrate.
Then you should put on a background that goes along with what's in the terrariums.
Next add a rock in the left hand corner that is the farthest away from you.
Next put a water bowl in the corner right in front of the rock.
After you get the water dish in the cage and it is level pour some dechlorinated water in it; chlorine is toxic to frogs.
Then put a place the toad(s) can hide in and can get in and out of easily that can probably fit about two toads in it on the right hand corner farthest away from you.. you can find things like this at a local pet store or you can make one by turning a butter container and cutting a hole big enough for your toad to fit in.

,
Put some artificial or real plants in the terrarium especially hanging over the water bowl.
Put some crickets in the terrarium depending on how many toads will be in it about two crickets per toad.
Put a thermometer on the left hand side of the terrarium.

,
Right next to that put a humidifier.

,
On the right hand side you can put an automatic mister up by the top of the side.
Put the toad(s) in and make sure they have enough room to move around that isn't already taken up that means that is just open space.

,
Once you done all the things you needed to do put the lid on the terrarium and enjoy.

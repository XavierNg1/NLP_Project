Put a white sticky label on each binder.
Do not draw, scribble or write on the cover of your binder (keep it neat).
If your binder gets lost, take action.
Put the label on the front cover of the binder, not on the inside, so you recognize it if you see it.
To prevent losing your binder in the first place, remember to keep your binders in a "locked position".
If allowed, buy a gym bag, or a hand bag to put all your binders inside, which make it easier to carry around from class to class.
If the inside of your desk is not surrounded by metal (it is open) that means students in front of you can reach in your desk and take things out.
DO NOT leave your binders unprotected in the changing room, as others may sneak in between classes.
At lunch time, put all your binders in your locker and make sure you lock your lock carefully.

At school, make sure your backpack is always closed (zipped up) properly to avoid binders falling out.

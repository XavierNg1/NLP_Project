Obtain a "DBA" (doing business as) certificate from your county clerk's office and a business license from your state if you plan on selling the alpacas and their fleece or end products made from the luxurious fiber.
Check your funding to make sure you have adequate money to launch and then support the farm.
Contact a real estate agent if you don't already have the land for your farm.
You also have to make sure that there are no plants toxic to the alpacas, such as acorns, buckwheat, and poppies.
Design a barn for the alpacas to protect them from the elements.
Enclose the land for the alpacas with a secure fence.
Find a veterinarian knowledgeable about alpacas near you for emergencies, checkups or routine shots and other tests and treatments you may not be able to take care of doing yourself.
Set up your farm by stocking up on protective supplies such as steel-toed boots, appropriate clothing, protective gloves, and disinfectants against their possible pathogens.
Purchase or grow hay for the alpacas so they can graze as well as eat hay.
Be sure to obtain adequate insurance for your alpaca business, especially mortality coverage for your most valuable breeding animals, and farm insurance for equipment and building coverages.

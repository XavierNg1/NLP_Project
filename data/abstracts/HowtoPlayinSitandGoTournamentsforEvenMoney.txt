Before playing in sit and go tournaments, play in freeroll tournaments.
Download the PokerStars game, open an online account, make a small deposit and choose a version of poker to play in.
Calculate, from the online poker sites view, their gains or losses from hosting these tournaments.
Be patient, tournament poker has bigger ups and downs than ring games but the big positive is that playing with real money is rewarding.

Pop your honey bear's top.
Heat slowly in warm water until honey is not viscous (It is a liquid) and is warm to hot to the touch.

,
Note: Don't over heat.
If it is not too hot you are either lucky to live in a warm place or the honey was overheated and you waited for it to cool down or it is not hot enough.
Look for chunks of honey that don't appear to move when the honey is dripping back down the walls of the bear.
Your crystals have disappeared.
Get out a bowl almost as tall as the bear, as wide as possible.
Make sure the lid is closed and seals adequately for partial submersion.
Wait a long time or until you can not tell the difference between the temperature of the water and the temperature of the room.

,
Dry off and store your honey in a more consistently warm place.

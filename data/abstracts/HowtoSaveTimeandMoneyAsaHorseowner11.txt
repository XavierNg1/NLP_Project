Groom only where tack goes to remove anything thing that might rub the horse, rather then do a full groom.
Use a hairbrush to brush out the tail and mane.
Brush mane/tail conditioner into the tail and mane regularly.
Use baby wipes to clean the face and dock areas.
Clip your horse in winter.
Hog or pull the mane.

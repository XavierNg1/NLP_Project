Know the warning signs of potential tornadoes.
Drive, if possible, to the nearest shelter.
Stay in your car if there is absolutely no other structure nearby.
Find a low spot relative to your current position if caught totally in the open.
Stay away from overpasses, bridges, or areas with potential for lots of debris.
If caught on open water, move perpendicular to the direction of the tornado.

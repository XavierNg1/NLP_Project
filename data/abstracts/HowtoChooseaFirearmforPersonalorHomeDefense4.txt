Pistols represent newer handgun technology than revolvers (though John Browning invented the idea of a slide enclosed barrel around 1900).
A pistol usually keeps its ammunition in a spring loaded box of metal called a magazine (not a clip as is commonly misunderstood).
Early pistols were plagued by reliability problems.
To some degree, a more expensive, name brand handgun may perform more reliably than a very inexpensive one.
Cost is not the only consideration though; the best gun is the one you actually have with you - it's better to have an inexpensive gun that no gun at all (assuming it's reliable).

There are also disadvantages to pistols:


Pistols are more difficult to operate safely.

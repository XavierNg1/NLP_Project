Walk in peacefully.
Smile.
Now is the time you make your move.
If you need to go to the bathroom.
When it's time for lunch sit at a table that you think you might feel comfortable.
Continue on with a normal day.
When it's the end of the day and it's time for school dismissal, be proud of yourself that you've gotten through the first day and made friends.

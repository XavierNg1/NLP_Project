First, know what you are being dared to do.
Then, get more information.
When you have this information written down, start to do the dare.
Now when you are doing it, be aware of how much evidence is left and clean it up.
If the dare requires any sneaking around in places you are not supposed to be in, be really quiet and see that the place looks like usual, and that all things are in place just like before.
You can always change your plan and do it at another time, confess that you were doing it, or whatever you're doing to the plan you have.
If whoever was not supposed to be seeing your dare insists on going with you to where you are doing it, act cool and go wherever you're going unless you're going someplace you're not supposed to go.
Now take action.
When you are done, take a break, and go do some more easier dares.
When you have done it, you will find that other dares seem pretty easy.

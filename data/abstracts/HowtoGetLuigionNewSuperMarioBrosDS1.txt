Start the game like normal.
Navigate to the file selection screen but don't pick a game just yet.
Highlight your desired file.
Hold the L and R buttons, located on the upper shoulders of the DS.
Still holding L and R, hit the A button to start your game.
Let go of L, and R and start playing.
Play the game exactly like normal, as Luigi hasn't changed in playstyle.

Create a full scale detailed compositional rendering.
Create your color study.
Prepare your plaster a few days in advance (the earlier the better - lime needs time to "adopt itself to the sand and gain plasticity) in proportion of 8 parts extra fine sand to 5 parts slaked (pitted) lime or so, with the least water possible.

,
Put three coats of plaster on your panel at intervals of 5 days in between the coats or "wet on wet".
Prepare your colors.
Use soft, long bristle brushes.
Leave it to settle.
Tracing from the cartoon pounced along the lines with needle or pouncing wheel is laid over the plaster and dusted over with charcoal or simply incised (pressed along the lines) by the opposite end of a thin brush to provide the base guideline for the painting process.
The end of the day for the fresco painter is the most pleasant stage.

Identify the ways in which you're covering up for your coworker.
Consider how covering for the coworker interferes directly with your job and even your personal life.
Acknowledge your stress and the impacts on the quality of your own work and home life.
Consider talking frankly but politely to your coworker from this point on.
Tell your coworker that you have something important to discuss with him or her and that you'd like his or her full attention.
State that you can no longer cover for your coworkers inefficiency or ineptitude.
Refuse to be your coworkerâ€™s cover in the future.
Embrace some failure in this process because, in all likelihood, it's going to be an issue.
If you have the time and expertise, offer to assist your lazy coworker with anything he or she seems particularly stuck on.

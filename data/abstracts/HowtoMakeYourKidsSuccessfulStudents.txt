Have your baby listen to your voice (mother and father would be better) as well as classical music.
When the baby pops some parts of his or her body, touch your womb or gently push it so the baby reacts.
Continue to have the baby listen to classical music after it is born, but never at a loud volume.
When your kid can talk, encourage him or her to ask questions about his or her surrounding world.
Teach your child how to color, write his or her name, recognize letters, numbers, family members on pictures, etc.
Let your child know that learning is fun.
Ask your child why he or she doesn't like a certain subject.
Teach your child how to be responsible.
Remember that your child needs to rest.
Never force your child to study a certain career because you like it.

Monitor unusual sounds and feelings in your back.
Check your back for an abnormal appearance.A hunched-over neck or a crooked spine could mean you have arthritis in your back.
Recognize a long-term problem.The “chronic” part of chronic arthritic back pain means that the problem has been ongoing (and possibly getting worse) over time.

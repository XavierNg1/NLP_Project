Where to grow and how: Chlorella is usually grown in concrete circular ponds up to 45 m in diameter, with agitation by a rotating arm (resembling a clock dial with the second hand running around).
The Tøeboò culture technology: This technology developed and optimized since 1960, is very different.
Optimization of the cultivation technology and the use of high-performance algal strains: This makes it possible to achieve high yields of the Chlorella biomass under suitable climatic conditions.

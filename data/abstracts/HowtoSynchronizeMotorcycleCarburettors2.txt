Use this method if you can't do it the "real" way.
Check carbs for obvious leaks in the bodies or manifolds, by spraying brake cleaner (or lighter fluid) on them - carefully!,
Empty the bowls, loosen the clamps and pull the carbs off!,
Slowly open the throttle.
Re-attach the carbs, and all their hoses.

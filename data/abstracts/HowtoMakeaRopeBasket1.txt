Wrap a metal pail with parchment paper or freezer paper to serve as the mold for your basket, then set it aside.You can use a pail with tapering sides, but make sure that the widest part is at the rim.
Get some â…œ-inch (0.95-centimeter) thick cotton piping cord.
Fold over one end of your rope, and glue it in place.
Start wrapping the rope around itself to create a flat disk, gluing it all around.Apply 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of hot glue, then press the rope into it.
Keep wrapping the rope until the disk is one coil larger than the base of your pail.
Place the pail on top of the rope disk, then start building the walls of your basket.
Continue building the walls of your basket until it is as tall as you'd like it to be.
Finish the end.
Consider adding some leather handles.

Be a role player and stick to it.
Know your limitations.

,
Experiment with hitting occasionally (maybe 15-25%) during practice, not in games!,
Keep your cool.
Don't hit balls where...


You stroke the ball without authority
You have difficulty positioning the ball consistently
You must telegraph where you are hitting (unless of course this is where you hit best).

,
Never sacrifice the pure fundamentals of hitting (hitting line drives, being selective, and hitting where you hit best) just to become a place hitter.
Keep your philosophy basically conservative.
Observe the other team.
Remember that as long as the ball is in the outfield nothing can be done to prevent runners from advancing.
Keep the umpire on your side.
Observe the umpires and how they seem to make decisions.
Have good attendance.
Be dedicated.
Have players who have been with the team the longest always start.
Have a good coach.

Rinse the skillet out with hot water after cooking.
Bring the water to boil.
With a wide spatula, lightly scrape the bottom and sides of the pan to dislodge any remaining food scraps.
Dump the dirty water in the sink.
Wet a couple paper towels and quickly wipe the surface of the skillet.
Apply a thin coating of fat, such as vegetable oil or shortening, to the surface of the skillet.
Store in a cool, dry place and cover with a paper towel instead of a lid to prevent moisture from building up inside the pan.

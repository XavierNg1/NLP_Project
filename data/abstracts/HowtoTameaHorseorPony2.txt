After your horse or pony has successfully joined up move on to ground work the next day.
Try again, but this time, pull back on the rope when giving the "whoa" command.
After you get the horse to stop on command teach it to back up.
Once the horse responds well walking, stopping, backing, and turning start working on showmanship patterns (even if you don't show) to get it to handle well.
Take it back to the round pen and make it stand.
Work on desensitizing it.
Lower the whip and let the horse sniff it.
Move on to scarier objects, such as bags, bags on a stick, tarpaulins, umbrellas, a bouncing ball, and just about anything you can think of that would scare a horse.

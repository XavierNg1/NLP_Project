Learn to recognize cognitive distortions.
Challenge “filtering.” Remember that nothing is all bad, and nothing is all good.
Challenge “catastrophizing.” Stop and think before you jump to conclusions.
Challenge “personalization.” No matter how we might feel, none of us is actually the center of the universe.
Challenge “overgeneralization.” “Why do horrible things always happen to me?” If that sounds familiar, you may have fallen prey to the distortion of overgeneralization.

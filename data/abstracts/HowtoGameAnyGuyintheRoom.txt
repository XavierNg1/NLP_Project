Have a good time.
Select your target.
Approach your target.
Win over his friends.
Let him know why he should be hanging out with you.
Acknowledge him personally.
Impose a time limit.
Leave him.
When you see him again (and you will), react like he's your old pal.
Concerning your target, body language is key.
Want to make out with him now?,
Getting his number/giving him yours is pretty easy at this point.

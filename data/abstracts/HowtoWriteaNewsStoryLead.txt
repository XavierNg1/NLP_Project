Know a "lead" from a "lede.",
Lead with your best stuff.
Worry about the lead, not the conclusion.
Provide the 5 "W's" and "H." A traditional lead attempts to answer most or all of the key questions -- Who?,
Keep it short.
Focus on action.
Break the rules when inspiration strikes.
Consider the benefits of leads for all writing.

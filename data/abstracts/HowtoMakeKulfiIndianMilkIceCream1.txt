Combine evaporated milk, condensed milk, and cream in a wide pot.Instead of simmering and reducing milk for an extended period of time, this recipe eliminates that step by using milk that has already gone through this process.
Bring the mixture to a boil and simmer for five minutes.Once the milk mixture begins to boil, reduce your stove to medium or low heat and allow it to simmer.
Remove the pot from the heat and stir in 1/2 teaspoon cardamom.

Don't assume you know what's "going down" even if you used to work in the same place.
Tread carefully at the start.
Take time to get to know people and their roles.
Observe.
Ask staff for their ideas.
Implement gradual change.
Don't accept the commonplace reasoning from worried or stagnating staff that "This is the way we've always done it."

Cut softened butter into cubes and put it into a bowl.
Beat the butter at low speed for at least 5 minutes until it is light and fluffy, has reached a much lighter color (near white) and has doubled in size.
Add half of the sugar and mix it into the butter.
Add the rest of the ingredients and continue mixing at a low speed.
Consider adding some coloring.
Add the rest of the sugar and beat the icing again using a high speed setting.
Store or serve the buttercream.

Prepare for the next bull market while prices are still falling.
Early in a bull market when prices have just started to bounce back from the bottom, consider all kinds of stocks, but look closely at those that have fallen the most during the bear market, typically the lower-quality, cyclical stocks (such as Alcoa and Dow Chemicals).
Focus on the hardest hit investment styles.
Keep buying stocks.
As the bull market continues to rise during the mid-phase, shift your focus more to high-quality stocks.
Know that when everyone finally concludes that things will get better forever, the bull market has now transitioned from mid- to late-phase.
Sell when everyone wants to buy.
Raise cash and get ready for the end of the bull market so you can buy again during the next bear market.

Spend some time planning your project.
Choose the type and finish of your material.
Choose the material you will glue your laminate to.
Choose that plastic laminate you will use for your project.
Match the contact cement to the laminate you choose.
Purchase disposable paint brushes or a paint roller with a close (short) nap to spread your glue.

,
Assemble the materials in a workshop or other location with good ventilation and lighting, relatively little dust, and plenty of workbench space.
Cut your plywood (or MDF) to the size you want.
Rip a strip of your plywood about 2 inches (5.1Â cm) wide the length of your top for an edge band.
Cut the laminate to fit the top.
Lay your plywood on a set of saw horses, and place the cut sheet of laminate, bottom up, on a workbench or other surface so you can apply the glue.
Roll or brush a thin coat of contact cement on both the plywood and the back of the laminate, making sure no runs or thick splatters form on either surface, as excess glue will cause a dimple or bump on the finished surface.

,
Allow the adhesive to dry until all the gloss, or wet appearance disappears.
Use a soft cloth to press the surface of the laminate, working from the center towards the edges.
Cut a piece of laminate for your edge band.
Glue the edge band on each exposed edge, applying the contact cement to the plywood edge and the back of the laminate as you did with the top sheet, and allowing it to dry.

,
Use a router with a laminate trimming bit to trim excess laminate on all edges.
Clean up any glue spots on the surfaces, and fit your countertop into position.

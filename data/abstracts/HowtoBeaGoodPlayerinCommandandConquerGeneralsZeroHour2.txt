During the opening four to five minutes of game play, you'll be most vulnerable to infantry divisions.
If you end up surviving the first four to five minutes of the game, concentrate on making your base structure defense.
Now comes the preemptive strike part.
Create three to four strike groups containing four to five heavy tanks and five to six tankettes.

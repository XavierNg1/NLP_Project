Make sure you have all the tools needed for this project.
Disassemble the phone to get to the keypad.
Clean the circuit board where the keypad lays against, sometimes it can be very dirty (yellow stick goo) and sometimes it can look very clean, either way we are going to wipe it down!,
Put it all back together!

Know what is metabolic alkalosis.
Learn what are acids and bases.
Lewis bases can be found in the body such as an electron pair on nitrogen of amino acids.
Fortunately, these changes in acidity and basicity are well controlled by well defined buffers in the body which usually are effective within a given range of pH.
Know what is a buffer.
Acids usually enter the cell and are buffered there by either the phosphate ion of the proteins.
Learn the most important ions in the extracellular space.
Know how metabolic alkalosis occurs.
This acid can sometimes cause peptic ulcer to the stomach mucosa due to its corrosive nature.
This basic environment is then absorbed to the blood circulation causing alkalosis of the blood.

,
Also ingestion of large amount of base such as bicarbonate ions in order to treat an existing metabolic acidosis can by itself induce a state of metabolic alkalosis if the base is taken in large quantity.
Also, a state of low potassium level in the extracellular space and in the blood can induce a state of metabolic alkalosis.

Get out a medium sized frying pan.
Turn on your stove and spray about three sprays of Pam into the pan.
Take your chicken breast and season it to your own personal liking.
Once the pan is heated, carefully place the chicken in the pan.
Let the chicken cook on the first side until you can see it just start to brown.
Once the chicken has gotten browned, flip it so it can cook on the other side.
After you have cooked both sides, get the two widths of the breasts browned.
Once all sides have been cooked, let the breast sit in the pan, while you flip it every 30 seconds or so.
Cut open the middle of the breast just slightly to see if the chicken is cooked.
Once the chicken is done, take it out of the pan and serve it to your liking.

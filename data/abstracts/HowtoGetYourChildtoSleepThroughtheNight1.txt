Perform the same bedtime routine every night.Another step you can take to help your child sleep through the night is to have the same bedtime routine every night.
Avoid screen time before bed.
Optimize your child's sleeping environment.Make sure your child's room is dark, and install room-darkening shades or blackout curtains if needed.
Put your child to sleep when she is drowsy, but not overtired.Interestingly enough, if a child is overtired, she is less likely to sleep well through the night.
Watch what your child eats before bed.
Allow your child to become attached to a stuffed animal.From the age of six months onward, it is advisable to get your child a stuffed animal or a blanket that she can become attached to.

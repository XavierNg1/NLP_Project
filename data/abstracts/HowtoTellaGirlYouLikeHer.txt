Get to know her as a friend before "making a move.",
Build a relationship off of common interests, finding common interests to bring your together as a couple.
Keep clean and well dressed to both look and feel confident.
Smile, keep your head up, and pull your shoulders back to exude confidence.
Stay calm, even if you're nervous, by slowly counting to three in your head before talking or responding.
Think about what you want to say ahead of time, but keep it brief.
Wait to tell her until the two of you are alone and she is in a good, stress-free mood.
Talk to her in person instead of through text, the internet, or a phone call.
Know that an open, honest discussion is far more important than any big surprise.
Look at her in the eyes.
Just come out and say it!,
Let her respond on her own instead of asking for a response.
Have a game plan.
Flirt with her through eye-contact, light touching, and smiles.
Don't try to rush through things.
Continue building the relationship as friends first, and a couple second.
Know that you did everything in your power, and be proud of your courage.
Understand that arguing or getting angry fixes nothing in this situation.
Give her some space for a few weeks.
Be open to other opportunities.

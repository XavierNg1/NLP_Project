Avoid subjects in low light, at least if you want them to be consistently lit.
Avoid bright reflections, and other "hot-spots".
Avoid anything that requires tight focusing.
Avoid "mirror shots", as well as arm-length shots taken by yourself.
Keep your subject big and prominent.
Keep your background clutter free.
Use your flash judiciously.
Frame your shot.
Use a backdrop when shooting still scenes.
Finally, take the picture.
Save the picture to your phone, if desired, copy it to your computer for any post-processing, and show it to your friends!

Set aside 10-45 minutes where you will be undisturbed.
Sit on your cushion or chair.
If you have chosen to use a chair, simply sit with your buttocks as far back on the chair as possible so that you feel supported by the back of the chair.
In either position, you should feel stable and dignified.
Sit facing a plain, unadorned wall.
Bring your awareness to your breath.
Expand your awareness to the sensory feedback coming from the entirety of the body and the mental activity of thought and emotion.
Notice the texture of your emotions from moment to moment.
Watch your thoughts as they come and go from one moment to the next, like clouds passing through the sky.
Accept your experience just as it is.
When you are finished with your meditation session, simply come out of sitting posture.

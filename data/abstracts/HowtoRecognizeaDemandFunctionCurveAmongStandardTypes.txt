To find the Demand Curve and Function for a single product, one must understand that in standard Economics, the relationship is inverse: Price Y determines Units Demanded X, or f(y) = x.
Create the variable and Column Headings for the first type of Demand Function Curve, the straight line function.
Create the Column Headings for the second type of Demand Function Curve, the Pressured Demand Curve.
Create the Column Headings for the third type of Demand Function Curve, the Pressured Demand Curves with Minimum Supply.
Enter the Column Formulas:

Into cell range A4:A74, enter 0 into cell A4 and do Edit Fill Series Column Linear Step Value .5, OK.
Create the first three Demand Curve Type Charts; here are pictures of them:


,
Create the Charts:

Edit Go To cell range B3:G74, given that zeroes except 1 were eliminated, and using Chart Wizard or Charts from the Ribbon select Charts, All/Other, Scatter, Smooth Line Scatter.
Create the Column Headings for the 4th type of Demand Function Curve, the Multi-Variable Demand Function Curve.
Enter the Column Data for the 4th type of Demand Curve:

Edit Go To cell range B82:B152 and enter to B82 the formula w/o quotes "=B4" and Edit Fill Down.
Create the Chart for the 4th kind of Demand Curve; here's a picture of it:

Edit Go To cell range B81:C152, and using Chart Wizard or Charts from the Ribbon select Charts, All/Other, Scatter, Smooth Line Scatter.
Create the Column Headings for the 5th type of Demand Function Curve, the Quadratic Demand Function With Outward Sloping Curve.
Enter the Column Data for the 5th type of Demand Curve:

Edit Go To cell range B160:B230 and enter 0 to B160 and 250 to cell B230 and do Edit Fill Series Column Linear (accept step value of 3.57+)(or hit Trend), OK.
Edit Go To cell range C160:C230 and enter to C160 the formula w/o quotes "=IF(-0.01*p^2-0.03*p+600>0,-0.01*p^2-0.03*p+600,0)" and Edit Fill Down.

Create the Chart for the 5th kind of Demand Curve; here's a picture of it:

Edit Go To cell range B159:C230, and using Chart Wizard or Charts from the Ribbon select Charts, All/Other, Scatter, Smooth Line Scatter.

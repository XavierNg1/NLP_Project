Senegal parrots tend to eat all kinds of seeds, fruits, and vegetables, and even human food if offered.
Movements and what do they mean: if the black part of their eye becomes small, it mean he/she is enjoying something.
Start from little to potty train it.
Spend at least 1 hour everyday giving complete attention of him/her.
If possible, try to have an extra open or closed cage that you will keep outside, and everyday, leave him/her outside to breathe fresh air, unless there is a possible danger of him/her flying away.

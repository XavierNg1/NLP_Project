Keep them clean.
If you live in a house, get your air ducts cleaned before using them.
When you do your regular vacuuming, make sure to get under any furniture that is on your rug.
Also, lift up the edges of your rug to check for moth activity under the rug.
Try getting your rugs professionally cleaned once a year.
If you find moth activity in your rug, get it to your professional rug cleaners quickly.
Don't panic or feel like you are not a perfect house cleaner if you find moth activity.

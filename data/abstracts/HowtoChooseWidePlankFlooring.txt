Choose a wood with the hue, grain, and finish that appeals to you and that will enhance the light and d√©cor of your room or home.
Oak has been the standard for durability, however all solid wood plank flooring is durable.
Decide on a plank width that suits the size of the room.
Once you have selected a wood for its appearance and appeal, select a grade that fits your budget.
Choose a finish that will enhance the brightness and tone of the wood as well as preserve it.
With these considerations in mind, take a few moments in the room or rooms you are going to re-floor and actively imagine the wonderful transformation you are about to make.
Next, work with a flooring consultant to confirm or help you with your final selection.

Take your measurements with the measuring tape.
Use the pillow as the body of the mannequin.
Gather some of the leftover material on the pillow to adjust the pillow to the size and shape of your body, and pin it tightly into the shape of your measurements––take it slowly and do this with care, so as not to stab yourself with the pins.
Once the pillow is adjusted, measure all three areas with the measuring tape.
Put the pillowcase onto the pillow.
Safety pin the bottom to keep the pole from falling out.
Finished.

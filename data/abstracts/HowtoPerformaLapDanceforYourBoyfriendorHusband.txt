Establish some basic rules.
In order to perform and enjoy the lap dance you must feel comfortable with your body.
Choose an outfit that makes you feel hot and sexy and the rest will follow.
Select 2 or 3 sensual songs that you both enjoy.
Don't feel pressured to start at the beginning of the song.
By setting aside a selection of 2 or 3 songs, you won't feel pressured to rush because the song is coming to an end.
For beginners, you may want to start out by taking your time, work your way into a seductive groove.
Seduce your lover with passionate looks.
Add a few accessories to your dance routine, items that you enjoy playing with.
Create the perfect atmosphere.
Clear the space where you’ll be dancing so you don’t bump into anything.
Send him a seductive text message or e-mail with a cryptic clue of what’s to come later in the evening.
Start the music and lead your lover to the chair.
Alternate between looking at him and looking down at your body, touching yourself as you move your hands down or across your body.
Then try a few hip circles.
Stand several steps in front of your partner.
Try the lap dance grind, swaying between your partner's legs, bumping and grinding your body against his crotch.
Move away, pose and begin removing an item of clothing.
Try a few seductive floor moves.
Throughout your lap dance, continue caressing yourself and don’t stay too close to your partner for too long.
If you’re feeling a little bit naughty and cruel, move back towards him like you’re about to take him with all the passion you can muster but instead lean over him, kiss him on the cheek, move back and gracefully put your clothes back on.
Try it a few times with different outfits, routines and music and you’ll soon become an expert in the sexiest dance of all.
At the end you should take off all of your clothes and tell him that your body is his for a set amount of time.
Sex is always an option after the lap dance.

Do not bring it into Power Surge as it's almost always medium-ranged combat.
Do not over-estimate the accuracy of the gun.
Always scope while counter-sniping.
Often go into Papa server.
If necessary, get the G36E Valkyrie for permanent before Friday 3 December at 11:00PM PST.
If all else fails, and you just can't cope with the scope... get the scope mod from MPGH.net to fix the scope.

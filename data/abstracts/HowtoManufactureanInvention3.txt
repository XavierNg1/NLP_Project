Typically, entrepreneurs with aspirations of turning their inventions into a business where they would sell their product would be the best candidates for manufacturing.
If you choose the path of developing and manufacturing your invention on your own, you maintain far more control of your invention.
For some inventions, little development and setup is required, which can simplify the manufacturing process.

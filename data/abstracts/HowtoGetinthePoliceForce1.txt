Once you have identified a number of departments you would like to work for, check off these items in your list below.
Assuming you have found a police department or a few that you are interested in and will be holding open recruitment sessions, pick up an application and fill out all of the required background information.
After filling out the background packet you may be asked to bring it with you to the recruitment session or mail in back in to the departments of your choice.
Once you pass the PT test, written, and initial interview, you may receive a letter to attend a polygraph or a psychological evaluation test.
At this point you may be informed to meet with your background investigator who is assigned to work on your employment file.
So you passed the hoops needed to get a conditional letter of employment with the department of your choosing, congratulations!

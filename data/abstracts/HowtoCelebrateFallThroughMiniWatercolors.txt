Make a list of words that representÂ the season.
Look in magazines, online and in newspapers to see how others depict autumn.
Cut a long strip, approximately 6" X 14" or use a piece of 11" X 14" watercolor paper from a pad.
Draw freehand squares and rectangles, as many as you wish, any size you like, to use for your miniature "snapshots" or paintings of autumn.
Fill each space with something that represents fall.
Start by filling a shape with a fat pumpkin, if you are having difficulty facing those blank canvases.
Set up a palette of primary and secondary tube watercolors.
Keep the hues of fall in mind as you begin to color your design.
Get started by working on the main elements of each scene.
Keep on painting until all miniature scenes are complete.
To do smaller details, consider outlining them with markers.
Stand up your paper.
Keep in mind that any background you pick can be altered, even drastically changed.
Allow the piece to dry overnight and evaluate it again.
Enjoy your foray into fall.

First make it simple by holding hands.
Ask if he is nervous for any reason.
Stare deeply into his eyes.

Gently pull him closer to you and put your hands around his neck.
Lean in, tilt your head to the right slightly, and he will hopefully respond and tilt his head to your left then kiss for a few seconds then gently pull away.

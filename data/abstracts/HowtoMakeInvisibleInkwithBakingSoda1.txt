Mix baking soda and water.
Dab a small brush or cotton swab into the solution.
Write your message on white paper.
Allow the “ink” to dry.
Consider steaming the page.When you write your message on the page, the watery “ink” will warp the paper, leaving marks that are visible even after the paper dries.
Consider writing a decoy message on the dry paper in pen or pencil.If your message is intercepted before delivery, an empty page would look suspicious.

Get a fresh, white carnation.
Trim about 4 inches (10 centimeters) off of the bottom of the carnation.
Split the stem lengthwise down the middle with a sharp knife.
Fill 2 to 3 small glasses with warm water.
Add some food coloring into each cup.
Set the carnation into the jars.
Wait for the carnation to start changing color.
Take the carnation out of the dye once it's the color you want it to be.

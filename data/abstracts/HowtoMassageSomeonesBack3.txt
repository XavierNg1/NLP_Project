Vary touch from light to firm, you can drag fingers lightly as if tickling, then alternate with firm or intermediate levels of touch.

Gentle chops are another way to vary the touch.
Don't limit touch to hands alone, another useful way to alternate touch is to use your elbow.
A knuckle massage is also effective, but like the elbow technique caution must be taken (in intensity and location).

Skin rolling is another way to vary your technique.

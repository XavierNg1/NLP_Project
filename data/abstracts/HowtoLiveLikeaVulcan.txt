Get your body used to a warmer climate.
Start to suppress your emotions.
Increase your vocabulary and be more intelligent.
Meditate or set up a meditation schedule.
To greet and send off people, you say, "Live long and prosper," while holding your hand (does not matter which) in the Vulcan Ta'al, or Vulcan hand sign.

,
Let your mind be governed by logic.
When speaking, do not use contractions!,
Make sure that you are always perfectly groomed.
Vulcans do not like to be touched, so stay away from others.
Do not touch your food unless necessary.
Slowly eat more and more plants and dwindle down on meat.
Be completely devoid of all emotion.
Congratulations!

Remember that Cockers, like most domesticated dogs, are 'people dogs', and need to have human company most of the time.
Make sure you can meet these conditions:


You are home most of the time (or can bring your little buddy with you when you leave the home)
You would enjoy your little friend following you wherever you go in, or out of the house.
Educate yourself on the grooming and basic maintenance of your Cocker.

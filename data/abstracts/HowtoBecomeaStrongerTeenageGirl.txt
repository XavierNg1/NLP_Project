Be opinionated.
Think.
Join activities where you have to go outdoors or learn survival skills.
Try to be less chatty.
Take walks on your own.
Try to find an unusual hobby.
Know you don't need loads of friends.
Get stronger.
Know that if you want to wear makeup, wear makeup, but if you don't, don't wear it.
Keep your hair however it is and leave it down.
Don't get too hung up on having a boyfriend/girlfriend.
Like said in the step about make up, being a strong teenage girl/young woman doesn't mean you have to dress a certain way to live up to someone else's idea of 'strong'.

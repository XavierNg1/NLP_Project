Go to the Spaceplane hangar.
,Start with a Mk2Â cockpit.
Add a liquid fuel fuselage behind the cockpit.
Optionally, swap the liquid fuel fuselage for a liquid fuel short fuselage and a cargo bay (cargo delivery).
Add a liquid fuel short fuselage behind the liquid fuel fuselage, followed by a Mk2 Bicoupler.
Add a LV-N nuclear engine to each part of the bicoupler, using symmetry mode.
Add a Wing Connector Type A to the sides of your plane, still using symmetry mode.
Tweak the positions of the wings using the offset tool.
Add a Mk1 Liquid Fuel Fuselage to each wing using symmetry mode.
Add an FL-T200 fuel tank to the front of each Mk1 Liquid Fuel Fuselage.
Add an AV-R8 winglet to the front of the plane, one on either side (symmetry mode again, if you haven't sussed it out yet).
Add an AV-R8 winglet on top of each Mk1 Liquid Fuel Fuselage.
On the end of each main wing, add an elevon.
Add a wheel on the bottom of each Mk1 fuselage.Use the offset tool to move the main wings backwards or forwards until the centres of mass and lift are aligned.
Set up some action groups.
Add some RCS thruster blocks.
Save and launch!,
Just remember: once you're in orbit, you have to get back...

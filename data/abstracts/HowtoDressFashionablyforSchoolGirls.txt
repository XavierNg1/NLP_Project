Buy a cool pair of jeans.
Try to buy new blouses whenever you have some spare money.
Skirts: Short skirts are always in and they should go to a little above your mid thigh.
Shorts: If you wear shorts at the knees make sure they are jean.
Accessories: Earrings are fine.
Makeup: Always carry a lip gloss tube with you.
Hair: Now this is the part where it becomes hard to decide, because it really varies from outfit to outfit.
Shoes: Flats with gold or silver linings are stylish if added with black leggings, but if not, it's fine too.
Bags: Before considering the fashion, be sure that your 'stylish' bag could contain all of your school supplies.
Be Confident.
Enjoy your fashion!

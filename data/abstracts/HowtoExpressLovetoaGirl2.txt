Say "I love you" when you feel in love, not because you think you "must" say it.
Use other words to express your love without always saying "I love you.",
Let her know how much you appreciate her help and support.
Offer your forgiveness and withhold your blame.
Be open and honest during arguments instead of hiding or sheltering concerns.
Make her a part of your plans and future.

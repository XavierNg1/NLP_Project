Get a tube.
Now you have a stethoscope.
To listen to your friend's heart, ask them to lift up or remove their shirt.
To listen to your friend's lungs, ask them to remove their shirt or lift it up.
To listen to your friend's tummy, ask them to lift up or take off their shirt.
You can also listen to your own chest and tummy with your stethoscope.

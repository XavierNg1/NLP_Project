Plan ahead and show discipline.
Look at the ends of the meat and seafood section.
Make friends with the butcher.
Compare brands and check prices.
Read circulars before you go into the store to see if what you need is on sale.
Clip coupons for items you normally buy and bring them with you.

Remember what you went to a store to buy, so you do not have to walk up and down aisles.
As you buy, write the prices on a pad that you keep with you.
Always bring a sensible shopping list, and STICK TO IT!,
Put all the costs into the little adding machine.

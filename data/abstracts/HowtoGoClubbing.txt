Make sure you are in a party mood.
Get friends you can go party with.
Identify the club you want to go to.
Find out when the club opens and when it closes.
Pick an outfit that's hip and trendy.
Take a shower and put on deodorant and a nice fragrance with good staying power, but nothing too overpowering.
Get dressed, but don't be ultra casual.
Also if you are a girl, it's a good idea to wear makeup, but don't overdo it.
Get a good meal before you go out.
Get your crew together and get to the club.
Once you are in the club, pick a spot/table, sit and get some drinks.
Sip your drink, make small talk, and enjoy the music.
If you are not having a good time, ask yourself why.

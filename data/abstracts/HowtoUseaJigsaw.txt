Select a jigsaw suitable for your project.
Select the correct blade for the material you are going to cut.
Prepare your workpiece for your cut.
Measure and mark the cut line you need for your project.
Place the material you are cutting on saw horses or a workbench, or clamp it in a vice, depending on which is best suited for your purpose.
Make sure you have sufficient light to see your cutting marks easily.
Position the blade close to the edge of the material where you will begin your cut.
Guide your saw along its path by twisting the back of the saw in the opposite direction you want the blade to travel, keeping the blade aligned with the cut line.
Stop the saw if sawdust or debris accumulates blocking your view of the cut line, or if this material interferes with the travel of the saw.
Complete your cut by continuing through the material, being careful to support any piece that may drop when the cut is finished until the blade is free of it.
Use a sander or plane to finish edges that become spalled or rough from the cutting process.

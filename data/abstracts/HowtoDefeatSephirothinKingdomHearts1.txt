Prepare for the battle beforehand.
Immediately cast Aero at the start of the battle.
Lock onto Sephiroth.
Recognize that in the beginning, Sephiroth follows a predictable pattern.
After getting hit by a full combo, Sephiroth will vanish in a flurry of black feathers.
Once Sephiroth's HP gauge reaches pink, his pattern of attack will change completely.
Once in a while, you will hear Sephiroth say "Descend Heartless Angel".
When you hear him yell "Power!",
After a while, he will introduce yet another attack.

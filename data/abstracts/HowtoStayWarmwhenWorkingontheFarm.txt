Get a warm hat.
Cover your ears and neck.
Get tight, waterproof gloves with grippers.
Wear silk underwear â€“ not the lingerie kind!,
Invest in a pair of knee-high farm boots and wear them with warm socks.
Tuck in your shirt, and anything else that can be tucked.
Keep moving.
Wear dark colors.
Breathe through your nose.
Eat your heart out.
Stay warm!

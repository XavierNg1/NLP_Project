Analyze your herd and present and past feeding program.
Watch your cows' behaviour for anything that may seem abnormal.
Call your local large animal veterinarian if you suspect one of your cows have come down with BSE.
Report your case (if the vet hasn't done it for you) your the federal food safety and health department.
Expect to have your farm undergo inspections to see if your other cattle have the same disease or at risk for such a disease.

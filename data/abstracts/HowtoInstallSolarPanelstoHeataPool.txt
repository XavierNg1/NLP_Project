Before you begin, consider your climate and reduce your expectations.
Install a 3-way pool valve after the pump and filter (in the return line) so water can be directed to the panels or to the pool (bypassing the panels).
Install a T pipe fitting near the 3-way value in the same return line on the pool side.
Maintain the same pipe size as the return pipe (usually 1-1/2" or 2") for the two lines to and from the solar panel location.
Plastic solar panels come in several sizes, but 2'x20' is common.
Fastening the panels to the roof may be your greatest challenge and a reason to consider placing them on the ground.
Once the solar panels are in place, connect them to each other and to the union fittings.
After the pipes are connected, turn on the pump and open the valve to the panels.
If you live in an area that experiences sub zero temperatures be sure to install a drain at the lowest point of the system or plan to pressurize the system with air to prevent freezing damage in the winter.

A solar controller system can be purchased for around $400 which includes temperature probes, valves and actuators to automate the system.

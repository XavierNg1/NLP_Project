If you are against a more powerful gun, improve your dodging skills.
Step or run back.
Run to your side.
Don't move forward or towards the attacker.
Also work on aiming.
Don't hold your shot too long.
If your opponents are moving backwards or towards you, have your gun pumped and squirt.
If you have a gun with a trigger, making a very powerful blast is easy.
Super soaker triggers usually break easily in the Secret Strike and the Flash Flood.
Once you've learned these tips, practice.

Prepare yourself for the new work: This may be the key if individuals or corporations expect success from the bid-tendering process.
Get the job specifications: Learn all about the work, materials, products or project that you need to bid on.
Be sure that you read the specs of your job or product and prepare your exact bid -- understanding all of the specifications and knowing the skill level and quality that you and your partners or employees must be able to do.
Write your job bid.
Ask the customer whether they will accept and seriously consider a bid using a different process or materials, done your way (for you and your team's know-how or a specialty).
Show a portfolio of similar work on your website (jobs you've completed): include your online gallery of photos, articles, documents (or PDFs) and references for customers to read.

You, as the bidder, or a partner, or sales persons should follow-up: visit, call or email to thank the potential customer for the bid and ask for the business to check your bid status and ask whether there are any questions.
Keep all commercial aspects of the quote in confidence, but it is important to get any details of the winning bid outcome and winning price if possible.
Stick to your bid, proposal, estimated amount, time schedules and specs.
Get paid, considering giving up an early pay discount: this requires knowing the terms and how long you expect to wait to be paid.
Watch out for the buyer to possibly negotiate for an even higher discount: when they are prepared to award the winning bid to you, as you, the Vendor are ready to take the order, and are in their office and have quoted a payment term of "Net 30 days" -- meaning no discount (which is your standard bid).

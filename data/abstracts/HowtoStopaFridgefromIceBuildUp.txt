Start with a fridge that's new, or one that's been defrosted.
Set the temperature control to the highest/warmest value that will still safely preserve your fresh and frozen food.
Keep the food section and, especially, the freezer section as full as possible, leaving very few air spaces.
Open the fridge door as infrequently as possible.
Use a small brush or rough sponge to brush or rub off some of the ice crystals.

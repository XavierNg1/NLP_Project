Read some books on animal behaviour or herding/handling cattle.
Go to a farm or ranch to observe and study actual cattle behaviour.
Note the behaviour that is being displayed between animals and/or towards you.
Ask yourself whether the cattle are exhibiting good behaviours or bad ones.
Consider the frame of mind the cattle might be in.
Familiarize yourself with such behaviours, and try to memorize them for future reference.

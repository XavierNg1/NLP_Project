Use lampworking for smaller glass objects.
Turn on your torch.
Heat the mandrel up in the blow torch slow.
Flash the glass through the tip of flame to prime it.
Start bringing the glass closer to the heart of the flame.
Attach the molten tip of the glass to the mandrel.
Introduce the mandrel with the glass bead back into the flame, rotating to keep the glass from slipping down.
Take the mandrel out of the flame and shape, as necessary, with a graphite paddle.
Allow the mandrel to cool off a bit before taking it to the annealer, rotating all the while.

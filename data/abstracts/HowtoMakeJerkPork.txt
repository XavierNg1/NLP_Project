Rub the seasoning into the pork shoulder.
Rub on the jerk marinade and leave it on the pork shoulder for at least 5 hours (overnight is recommended).
The next morning, prepare a grill at a low temperature and barbecue the pork shoulder until it's nice and tender.
Allow your roast to rest for 5-10 minutes before cutting.
Feel free to serve it with hard dough bread, festival, fried dumplings, rice and peas, boiled yams and plantain, etc.

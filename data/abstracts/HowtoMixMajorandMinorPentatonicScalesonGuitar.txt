Review your major and minor pentatonic scale shapes, playing them until you have them down cold.
Bend or slide the minor thirds a half-step into the major scale.
Use mixed notes, like the minor third, to transition between scales.
Find your "relative blues scale" attached to the front of the major scale.
Use the flat five, or "blues note" in the relative minor pentatonic for easy transitions.

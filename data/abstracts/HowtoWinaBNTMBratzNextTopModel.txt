Make sure you do not have a dark photo, which means have good lighting.
Do not have frizzy hair or messy hair.
Make a good impression with all your judges so they will like to know you and how well you model.

You can wear any makeup, jewelry and clothes but make sure they are high-fashion.
For editing your photos, I usually don't.

Add details like another model or some decorations.

Do your best on camera angles and take more than one photo.
Have fun.

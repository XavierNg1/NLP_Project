Take a look through your cloth stash.

Cut the fabric into 3/4 inch (around 1.5 cm) strips.

Lay a cinnamon stick on the work space in front of you.
,

Tie the shortest strip of cloth onto the stick near the top end.

Move on down the length of the cinnamon stick, tying successively longer cloth strips to the stick.

If your cloth strips are noticeably uneven, straighten them up at this point.

Leave around an inch of stick at each end.

Tidy up any loose ends and place the finished cinnamon tree on display.

Get a 12 to 24-inch (30.48 to 60.96-centimeter) metal floral wreath.
Cut five, orange pipe cleaners in half so that you end up with ten, 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) mini pipe cleaners.
Imagine your wreath as a clock, then tie each pipe cleaner to each clock position, except for 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock.
Gather the end of some orange deco mesh, and place it over the center of the 2 o'clock pipe cleaner.
Twist the pipe cleaners tightly around the deco mesh to hold it in place.
Gently pull the deco mesh downward to the 4 o'clock position, and tie it in place.
Gently pull the deco mesh back up to the 1 o'clock position.
Continue pulling the deco mesh back and forth across the front of the wreath.
Finish by pulling the mesh from 10 o'clock down to 8 o'clock.
Roll a 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) wide strip of burlap ribbon into a tube to make the stem.
Tie the stem to the back of the pumpkin.
Cut two strips of 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) wide green, mesh ribbon to make the leaves.
Tie the strips together about the middle, then cut V-shaped notches into each end.
Tie the leaves to the base of the stem.
Cut two long pieces of green deco mesh tubing to make the vines.
Tie the vines around the middle to the back of the stem.
Gently fluff the deco mesh out.
Hang the wreath up.

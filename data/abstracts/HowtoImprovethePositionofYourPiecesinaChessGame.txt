Don't move the same piece twice in the first 7 moves because this wastes time.
Make sure that your pieces are "developed.",
Attack your opponents pieces with gain of time.
Have a plan.
Use the acrostic "SPACE" to help look for a plan.
Look for weaknesses in your opponent's position, then look for ways to exploit those weaknesses.
Remember that every game is different.

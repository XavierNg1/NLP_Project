Gather the best materials.
Find a good writing table.
Develop good writing posture.Once you’ve found a table that will discourage you from slumping or hitching your shoulders up, you need to hold your body in a way that prevents the back, neck, and shoulder pain that can accompany improper posture.
Position the page at an angle between 30 and 45 degrees.Sit flush with the edge of the desk, then turn the page you’re writing on until it sits at an angle somewhere between 30 and 45 degrees to your body.
Stretch your hands before writing.The rise of computers and cell phones for written communication has had a significant negative impact on handwriting — one study revealed that 33% of people have trouble reading their own writing.Another symptom of this decline is the infrequency with which people write by hand these days; if you don’t stretch your hands to prepare them for a sudden increase in activity, you’ll find yourself cramping up sooner than you’d like.

Listen to recorded speeches.If you want to become a great speaker, you should first have an idea on what it means to be great.
Talk slowly.As a public speaker, you should never feel the need to rush through a presentation.
Minimize filler words and stammering.
Emphasize or repeat particularly important lines.Even if you have gone over every word of your speech with a fine-toothed comb, there are going to be lines that are most important to the central idea you're discussing.
Express emotion through inflections.
Pause for effect.
Interact with your audience.Speeches can be memorized with enough time and practice, but a truly gifted orator will use parts of his speech as an opportunity to communicate directly to the audience.

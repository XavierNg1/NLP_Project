Obtain materials:

Hockey puck.
Obtain access to tools:

Drill press.
Find the centre of the hockey puck:

Estimate the location of the centre and make a small mark.
Insert the spade bit into the drill press.

,
Set the drill press speed low.
Adjust the drill press depth of plunge, so the spade bit will leave about 1⁄4 to 3⁄8 inch (0.6 to 1.0 cm) undrilled material at the bottom of the hole.
Use clamps, a drill press vise, or other mechanism to hold the hockey puck securely on the drill press table, with the centre of the hockey puck exactly positioned under the point of the spade bit.

,
Drill the hole in the puck.
Clean up the puck and erase any pencil lines.

,
Test by inserting the rain gauge base into the hole.
Remove the rain gauge from the hockey puck, and run a brass flat-head screw through the centre of the hole.
You're done!

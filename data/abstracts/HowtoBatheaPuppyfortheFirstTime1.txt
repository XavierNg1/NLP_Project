Make the bathing area a positive space.Before giving your puppy his first bath, play with him in the bath or sink a few times without any water.
Introduce water slowly.Once the puppy's familiar with the bathing area when it's dry, start getting him used to the idea of water.
Buy a shampoo formulated for dogs.Dogs and humans have very different skin needs, so you can't use human shampoo for your pup.
Prepare the bathing area.Place a clean, wet washcloth on the bottom of the sink/bath so the pup won't slip when it's filled with soapy water.
Dress appropriately.You don't want to ruin an nice outfit with water, dog hair, and shampoo.
Foresee potential distractions.
Gather your supplies.
Brush out the puppy's coat.Mats and tangles are easier to remove when the coat is dry, so do this before the bath.
Make the puppy as comfortable as possible.
Take a deep breath and relax.

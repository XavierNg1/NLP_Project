Isolate where the leak is.
Dig a reasonable work space around and under the break, as you will want a bit of "play" or movement in the PVC in order to achieve a rock-solid tight fit with your repair.
Using purple primer and the brush that comes with it, prime the outside of both of the remaining sprinkler pipe ends by painting a 1–2 inch (2.5–5.1 cm) wide strip around the outside of each pipe end starting at the lip/edge.
Cut a piece of repair pipe to fit the length of the cut you made in the sprinkler line, minus approximately 1/2" or more for each straight coupler used (the coupler adds approximately 1/2 inch to the length of the finished pipe).
Fit the cut piece into the couplers dry, to be sure that the fit is correct and that the resulting pipe is not bowed,from the replacement piece being too long.

,
Disassemble and make any necessary adjustments, until the resulting fit is perfect.

,
Prime both ends of your cut piece, wait 5 seconds, then apply a light layer of glue to one end of the replacement piece and inside one of the straight couplers.
Alternatively, use a "repair" coupling which does not have the inside center ridge; basically an over-sized section of pipe.
Alternatively, you can cut a coupling piece in half, lengthwise.
Watch the area of your repair for a few minutes before you cover your hole back up.

Turn: The shooting form starts when a player receives a ball and squares up for the shot.
Release: At the point of release, the player should have his strong hand underneath the ball, with the fingers pointing towards him.
Follow Through: After a shot is release, the player should maintain the shooting form of the strong hand with the arm still extended and the wrist bent towards the ring.
Practice: With all these fundamentals, the best thing a player can do to improve his form is to constantly practice it.

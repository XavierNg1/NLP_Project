Keep your distance from the brute you want to kill.
Remove all surrounding enemies as brutes are far easier to kill if they don't have their grunt or jackal mates around them throwing grenades and trying to snipe you.
Attempt sticking them with a plasma or spike grenade, or even an incendiary grenade if you can.
Aim for the head if grenades don't work.
Melee them in the back if you have no other option.
Retreat and regroup if you are finding it too hard.

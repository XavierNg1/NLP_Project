Quit smoking.Studies show that people who smoke cigarettes or are exposed to a lot of secondhand smoke are much more likely to develop chronic bronchitis.Because of this, it is important that you quit smoking or avoid second-hand smoke if you are concerned about getting bronchitis.
Limit your exposure to things that can irritate your lungs.
Follow a diet that focuses on boosting your immune system.
Be extra cautious if you have an immune disorder.When you have a weakened immune system, your body is much more likely to let bacteria or a virus get into you and make you sick (as your immune system is less able to fight it off).
Get your flu shot each flu season.Flu season, which happens in the fall and winter months, is the time when you are most likely to get bronchitis.
Ensure that your child has all of his or her recommended immunizations.In addition to getting your annual flu vaccine, it is especially important to make sure that all of your children (if you have any) are also up to date on their vaccinations.

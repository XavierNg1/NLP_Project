Bites and scratches may need special care, because germs from the animal or person might have gotten into the wound.
Certain cuts or bites could develop into tetanus, another serious illness.
Sometimes, a cut, scratch, or abrasion starts out as no big deal, but then it gets infected.
Most often, your cuts, scratches, and abrasions go away on their own, thanks to your body's amazing ability to heal itself.

If necessary, cut in along the corners with a wall brush or an angled brush.
While the cut in line is still wet, paint the ceiling with your roller.
Paint in sections until the entire ceiling is covered with zigzags.
Go over the zigzags with straight lines on your roller.
Treat your vaulted ceiling like a wall.

Position the patient's arm so the elbow is about even with the heart and slightly bent.

,
Wrap a blood pressure cuff, or sphygmomanometer, around the patient's upper arm.
Use the stethoscope on the arm to listen for a pulse.
Close the valve and use the bulb to inflate the cuff.
Continue inflating until the gauge reads 30 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) higher than it did when the pulse disappeared.

,
Open the valve just enough to let the air out slowly, no faster than 5 mmHg per second.
Note the reading when you can hear the pulse again.
Continue deflating the cuff while listening to the pulse.

,
Note the reading when the pulse disappears again.
Write down the blood pressure.
Take the blood pressure in the other arm and compare the readings.
Record each blood pressure reading, the arm you used to take the reading, and the time at which you took it.

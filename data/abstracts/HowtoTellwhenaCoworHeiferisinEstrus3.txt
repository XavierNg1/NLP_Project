Walk out to the pasture or corral where you are keeping your cows and/or heifers.
Find some place to sit where you can easily watch the behaviour of your cattle but at the same time, don't really attract the attention of your animals.
Look for behavioral signs if estrus: (Note that the herd is highly sensitive to when even one female is in heat!),
Also note any physical signs of estrus:


Clear discharge from her vulva; the discharge would be so viscous it has the consistency of egg white.
Record the tag number or name of the cow that is in heat or has been bred in your notebook.

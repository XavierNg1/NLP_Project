Gather your material.
Take your measurements.
Fold your fabric in half.

,
In the center of the folded line, draw a semi-circle that is half of 'W'.
Measure out from the edge of this semi-circle the desired length of your skirt 'L', and draw in a bigger semi-circle.

,
Measure the waist cut with another calculation.
Cut your fabric following these semi-circles, making sure to cut both layers.
Hem the bottom of the skirt by rolling one inch of fabric under to hide the cut edge.
Fold over 1" at the waistband and stitch close to the cut edge, so it creates a 1" channel.
Thread some elastic into this gap, around the channel, and out the gap again.
Stitch the two ends of the elastic together and close the gap in the waistband.
Make a small poodle out of black or white felt and sew it on.
Finished!

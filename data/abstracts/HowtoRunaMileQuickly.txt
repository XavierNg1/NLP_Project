Before you start, be sure to drink plenty of water.
Be sure that you get a good stretching in.
Try listening to music.
When starting, if there are tons of people in front of you at the starting line, don't push to be first.
Start off slowly.
Be smart and think smart.
In the middle of the run, try to keep your mind off things that you forgot to do.
Always try to find the finish line if you can see it.
At the end, (You should know you're towards the end when you see the finish line), Take that energy you left and let it all out.

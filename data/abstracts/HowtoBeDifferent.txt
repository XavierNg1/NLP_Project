Know you're unique.
Find yourself and be yourself.
Spend some time alone.
Know what you want.
Know how you want to be different.
Note your environment.
Observe.
Do what you like.
Try new things.
Color outside the lines.
Be absurd.
Shake hands with your enemies.
Dress for yourself.
Don't get caught up in games.
Say what everyone else is thinking.
Don't bother trying to impress.
Know the world works in opposites.
Know you'll bump heads.

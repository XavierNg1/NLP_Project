Use a preflight checklist if you have one.
Begin your preflight in the cockpit, since before flying, you will need to make sure all cockpit equipment is operating, and the fuel tanks have sufficient fuel for your flight.
Exit the aircraft.
Walk around the aircraft, looking for damage cause by impacts or cracks and seams separating from airframe fatigue, hard landings, or other mishaps.

,
Begin at the right wing, after exiting the aircraft, and look at the forward wing surface for nicks, loose fasteners, dents, or other damage.
Remove the fuel cap (for wing fuel tanks) and visually confirm they have sufficient fuel to make your flight.
Check stall indicator (depending on which wing it is mounted on), struts, if applicable, and other features on the right wing.

,
Move down the right side of the aircraft.
Move to the tail assembly.
Look at the antennae assembly, which is usually located at the tail, as well as the tail wheel, to be sure no lubricants or brake fluid is leaking, and that the tire is properly inflated.
Move to the opposite side of the aircraft, continuing to look over the aircraft skin to the wing.
Move to the front of the aircraft and look at the exhaust; looking for oil blow-out and other damage.

,
Check the engine oil, the ignition wires, magneto electrical connections, and the fuel lines and other hoses to be sure they are seated properly and tightly clamped.
Move to the propeller.
Check for fuel or lubricant leaks around the engine compartment, cowling, and fuel tank locations.
Take a look at the wheels, landing gear, and landing gear compartment doors.
Remove the wing tie downs and wheel chocks, walk to the front of the aircraft, and take a long, careful look to make sure you have not overlooked anything.

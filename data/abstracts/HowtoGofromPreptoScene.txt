Go shopping over the weekend, go to stores like Aeropostale, Pac Sun, Rue 21, Journeys, Sanrio, etc.
On Monday, wear something a little scene looking, like tight or skinny neon jeans, neon shirts or fruity colored cartoon shirts, party shades and piercings.
Get your hair cut 3-4 weeks after you start.
Listen to scene music.

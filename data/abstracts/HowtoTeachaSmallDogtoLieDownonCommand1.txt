Kneel on the ground next to your dog, making sure your dog is facing you.
Hold the lure (usually a treat) in front of your dog's nose (but don't let him eat it yet!).
Repeat this process until your dog understands and does the laying down motion easily when you move the treat towards his chest/between his front legs.
Try again with the treat somewhat removed.
Keep practicing.

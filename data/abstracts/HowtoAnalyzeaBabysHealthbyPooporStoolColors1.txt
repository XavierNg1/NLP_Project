Keep a record of how your baby’s poop looks.
Look out for hard, small poops.
Don’t worry if you occasionally see bits and pieces of undigested food in the poop.Sometimes food travels so quickly through the gut that it is not fully broken down.
Contact your doctor when you see diarrhea of any color.

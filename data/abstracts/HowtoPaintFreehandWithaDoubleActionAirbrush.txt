Control #1 – Distance – Paint from the airbrush comes out in a conical shape.
Control #2 – Volume – The finger button on top of single action airbrush allows the artist to control air flow only.
Control #3 – Speed – Time is a factor in airbrushing.
Good airbrush technique is realized by learning to master all three controls at the same time.

Know how to prepare for the serve---Serving is a very important part of tennis, and if one cannot serve the tennis ball in, their game will be greatly affected.
Learn the grip for serving---The grip you hold your racket with, is a main factor that decides the power, spin, and accuracy of your serve.
Know your own style of play---Knowing your style of play and what shots you prefer to hit over others, will set the basis of which type of serve you want.
Realize which type of serve you want and stick to it---This is a big problem for many people currently playing tennis.
Maintain the right form---Serving for a long period of time may allow a person to develop his own form.
Jump and Sudden Burst---Jumping for your serve allows you to get a height advantage and further increase your chances of getting the ball inside the service box.
Pronation---This is a difficult technique used by many people who want a decent serve.
Serve---The most important serve of tennis is not the first, but the second.
Condition and Practice---People with a strong serve normally require a lot of energy in order to keep up their serve throughout the match.

If you haven't already yet, consider growing marijuana the traditional way before you grow hydro.
Obtain all the necessary items.
Prep your walls.
Set up your grow lights.
Make sure your lights are producing at least the minimum, and preferably the ideal, amount of lumens per square foot.
Take care that you don't burn or overheat your plants with your light source.
Get your grow room ventilated.
Germinate your marijuana seed.
Once the seed has germinated, transfer to a rock wool block.
Start feeding your plants with water (filtered or tap) mixed with nutrients.
Water your plants with pH'ed and nutrient-filled water whenever the top of the coco coir starts feeling dry.
Keep your marijuana plants in the vegetative stage of growth until they are about half their final desired height.
Start the flowering stage when your plants achieved the correct height.
Sex your plants and get rid of any males.
Wait patiently while your plants mature in the flowering stage.
Start feeding your marijuana plants just plain, pH'ed water 1-2 weeks before it's time to harvest.
Harvest your plants when they're ready by cutting down the whole plant or cutting off pieces of buds at a time.
Trim your plant so that there aren't any leaves sticking out from the buds.
Hang your trimmed buds upside down in a cool, dark place and let them dry until the buds snap off cleanly (as opposed to just bending) when you put pressure on them.

Place the buds in an air-tight container and leave them in a cool, dark place for 2 weeks to a month of more to "cure."

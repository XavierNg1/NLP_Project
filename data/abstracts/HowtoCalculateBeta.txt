Find the risk-free rate.
Determine the respective rates of return for the stock and for the market or appropriate index.
Subtract the risk-free rate from the stock's rate of return.
Subtract the risk-free rate from the market (or index) rate of return.
Divide the first difference above by the second difference above.
Find the risk-free rate.
Determine the rate of return for the market or its representative index.
Multiply the beta value by the difference between the market rate of return and the risk-free rate.
Add the result to the risk-free rate.
Make three price columns in Excel.
Enter your data points into the spreadsheet.
Create two return columns to the right of your price columns.
Begin calculating returns for the stock market index.
Use the copy function to repeat this process for all the data points in your index-price column.
Repeat this same process for calculating returns, this time for the individual stock instead of the index.
Plot the data in a chart.
Add a trendline to your scatter chart.
Find the coefficient for the "x" value in the equation of the trendline.
Know how to interpret beta.
Know that risk is usually related to return.
Expect that a stock with a beta of 1 will move in lockstep with the market.
Put both high- and low-beta stocks in your portfolio for adequate diversification.
Understand that, like most financial prediction tools, beta cannot reliably predict the future.

Before race day, train with your relay team.
Figure out who's running during each part of the relay.
Warm up and stretch if you haven't already.

,
Go to the part of the track where you will begin your leg of the relay.

,
If you are starting the relay, simply relax and wait for the gun to go off.
When it comes time to hand off the relay, if you are the one handing it off, put your arm out at a 90 degree angle to your body with your arm outstretched and palm pointing down.
If you are receiving the baton, start running a little right before you get it, while staying in the hand-off zone and look back to see when you get it.
The person receiving the hand-off should take the baton in the hand opposite the hand in which their teammate is carrying it.
Know the event.


,
When it seems like its all over, and the other team is definitely going to win, keep pushing yourself.

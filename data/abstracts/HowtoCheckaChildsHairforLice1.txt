Wash your child's hair.
Comb your child's hair.
Switch to a lice removal comb.
Make sure you'll be able to see.
Start at the scalp and brush out firmly to the ends of your child's hair.
Check near the hair follicle, about 1/4-inch (6 mm) to 1/2-inch from the scalp, for eggs (called nits).

Understand what to look for.
Rinse the comb under a faucet after each stroke or dislodge the lice using a piece of wet toilet paper.

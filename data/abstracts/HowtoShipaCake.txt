Frost the cake with a stiff icing.
Freeze the cake prior to shipping to set the icing and help the cake hold its shape.
Place the wrapped cake in a pre-cooled Styrofoam cooler.
Carefully place the cake package in a sturdy corrugated cardboard box.
Seal the corrugated box shut with two-inch wide, pressure-sensitive plastic tape.
Note which side of the box is up.
Choose a shipping service that would ship the cake the same day or overnight, whenever possible.

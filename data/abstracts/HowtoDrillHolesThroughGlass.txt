Determine the type of glass you want to drill.
Buy or use a drill that you already have at home.
Choose the right drill bit.
Use a diamond drill bit instead.
Place the glass in a small container, if it fits.
Tape a small piece of dense cardboard or tape to the glass.
Start drilling at a very slow rpm.
Lighten up the drilling pressure and speed even more so when the drill tip is close to breaking through the glass.
Use coolant so the drill bit doesn't get too hot.

Buy a humane trap.
Check your trap every day, and hopefully it will be closed!,
Be very careful!,
Watch your mouse.
Give it some food and drink.
Leave it in its box for a couple of days to get used to captivity.
Get a range of toys (you might like to get an exerciser ball for your mouse, they LOVE them) for your cage and a water bottle and a food bottle and a nest box of your choice, and set everything up in a fun way for your mouse.
Put your mouse in his/her new cage and let him/her explore for the rest of the day!,
Feed the mouse some cereal and a few of the treats of vegetables, every morning.
Clean your cage THOROUGHLY every week.
Tame your mouse.
Repeat these steps, until you are really confident about holding him/her.
Open your hand so he/she can move about on your hand.
Repeat this process and you will soon, with a bit of patience, have a loving pet!

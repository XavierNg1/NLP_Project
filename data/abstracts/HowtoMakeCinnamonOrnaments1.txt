Preheat your oven to 200°F (94°C).
Mix the applesauce and cinnamon in a bowl with a rubber spatula.
Roll the dough out until it is ¼-inch to 1/3-inch (6.4 to 8.5 millimeters) thick.
Cut the dough using cookie cutters.
Poke a hole near the top of each ornament.
Place the ornaments on a baking sheet, and bake for 2 hours and 30 minutes.
Allow the ornaments to cool, then decorate them, if desired.
Thread a piece of ribbon through the hole, and tie it into a secure knot.
Finished.

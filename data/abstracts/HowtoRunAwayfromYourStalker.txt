Tell someone about the problem.
See if you have a mutual friend or acquaintance with your stalker.
If you have a distinct feature you might try doing something that you usually don't, so you won't be noticed.
Find the return address of any mail sent to you.
Pay attention to what halls or places you usually see him/her in.
If you can, walk by a police station, as this will deter the stalker from following you.
Make sure you have a way to spot them from a distance.
Keep everything.
Talking to the person or making eye contact could be dangerous, because they are afraid to talk to you or are trying to hurt you.
Consider how to defend yourself if you are ever physically assaulted.
If this person comes up to you and recites personal things, ignore him/her, walk away from them.
Get a restraining order.

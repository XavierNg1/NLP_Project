Insert a funnel into the end of a balloon.Regular latex balloons and an ordinary kitchen funnel will work just fine.

Tie the balloon.Remove the funnel, taking care not to spill the plaster out of the balloon.
Float the balloon.Place the tied-up balloon in a bucket of water while the plaster of Paris sets.
Cut away the balloon.Dry the balloon and cut the end off.
Decorate your eggs.Let the plaster of Paris eggs dry for about 24 hours.

Familiarize yourself with the layout.
For outlets, all the wires will attach to the outlets.
Attach the neutrals (white) to the two side screws that are on the same side as the ground (green) screw.
If you come to an outlet box that only has three wires in it (not six), it means you've reached the end of the circuit.

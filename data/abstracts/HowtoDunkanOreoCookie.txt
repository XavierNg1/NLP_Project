Obtain a box of Oreo cookies from the local grocery store or gas station.
Once you have safely arrived at home, place the Oreo cookies on the table.
After the milk has been poured, open the box of cookies.
Lower the cookie gently into the milk until about half the cookie is submerged.
Be patient!,
Once the cookie has been removed from the milk, gingerly raise the cookie to your mouth, careful not to break the soggy cookie in half.
Or, you can be very daring and gently hold the Oreo between your thumb and index-finger and dunk the whole Oreo inside the milk to just past your fingernails.

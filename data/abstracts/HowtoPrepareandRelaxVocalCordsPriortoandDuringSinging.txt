Make sure to warm up your voice before you do any performing or practice.
Make sure to drink room-temperature water before you sing.
Don't get too nervous, else your throat will close up and your vocal cords will have to be warmed up again.
Breathe deeply and stay focused.
If you are having a break in between practices or performances try to stay away from dairy products and have a cup of hot water with honey, and don't forget to do a few quick scales before singing again and return to your room-temperature water while singing.
If you are auditioning, relax act as if you are singing to your number one fan-but keep your character!

,Try to stay away from chocolate, peanut butter, milk or any sort of dairy; that is just about the worst thing you can eat before performing

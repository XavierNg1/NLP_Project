Rifles are what most people envision when they think of a long gun.
Rifles have a smaller cousin called a "carbine".
Rifle advantages:


Unlike pistol bullets, which typically create narrow permanent wound channels, the greatly increased speed of rifle bullets create a shock wave that can permanently destroy large amounts of tissue, greatly increasing your chances of stopping the threat with a single reasonably placed shot.
The disadvantages of a rifle:


As with any long gun, maneuverability is greatly reduced due to its overall length.

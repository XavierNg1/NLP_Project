Determine the size of your needles.
Decide how many colors you want to include in your scarf.
Determine the texture of your yarn.
Decide how many stitches you want to include.
Make 25 loops and hook them onto one of the needles.
Holding the needle with stitches in your left hand, hold the free needle with your right hand.
Wrap the yarn once around the needle going counter-clockwise.
Take the right needle and go under the yarn on the left needle and lift up until it comes off the needle.
Transition straight into the next row.
Continue this process for the remainder of the scarf.

Have a good shower before you go to get the honey and wear completely clean clothes.
Make sure that your target is actually a honeybee hive.
Follow the bees to their home.
Burn some plants or wood to make smoke.
Put the smoking material into a container you can carry, and take it over to the hive.
Working slowly and carefully, cut a piece of the honeycomb with a sharp knife.
Try to spot which bee is the queen.
Move away with your honeycomb.

Remember that your help or support will be needed long term.
There will be false starts, and setbacks.
Start by attending the funeral and any memorial service.
Be practical.
Be free with physical shows of support.
Do some research on the grieving process.
Expect the grief to increase not decrease.
Don't try to mend things and don't try to counsel or advise.
Never compare a child's death with a non-child death of your own you've experienced.
Don't be afraid to talk about the child.
Don't just disappear.
Give them space.

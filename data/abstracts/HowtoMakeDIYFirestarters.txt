First you want to cut your wicks to a proper length.
Then you are going to want to take your wood shavings or sawdust and fill your paper cup up halfway.

,
At this point you want to melt your wax.
Once you have melted wax you pour it into your paper cups over the woodchips.
Leave the cups for about ten to twenty minutes to harden and you have a firestarter!

,
To use the firestarter, just place in your fire like you would do with tinder and light it.

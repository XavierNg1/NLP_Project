To begin, look in the mirror.
After deciding what you need to wear, go shopping for your makeup, if you don't already have it.
Make sure you have a great base!,
The quality of your eyeshadow will determine what you have to do first.
After you do your eye makeup or face makeup first, go ahead and do the other one.
After finishing your eye and face makeup, move onto your lips.

Find some strong thread.
Snip about 20 inches (51Â cm) (a foot and a half) of thread.
Tie the two ends of the thread together.
Now hold the thread with both hands, and wind it around ten times.
Place the thread around the fingers of both hands.
Practice the above motions until you feel fairly comfortable with the movements of your hands.
Once you are comfortable, its time to start practicing on real hair!,
Sitting on your bed or on a chair, prop up one leg and identify the portion from which you want to remove hair.

,
Place the thread on this portion.
Now, move the wound portion to the other side, making sure that it catches the hair while moving.
Be patient.
Once you are comfortable, move onto your upper lip or other parts of your face that need to be threaded.

Avoid doing this on your eyebrows unless you are absolutely confident in your abilities.

Line up the blind slats and the bottom rail evenly.
Secure the ends of the slats with rubber bands or a clamp.
Cover the ends of the slats with masking tape to prevent chipping or splintering.
Measure and mark the appropriate width.
Ensure that the headrail is not in the way of the saw blade by sliding all of the slats over to one side.
Cut the blind slats and bottom rail using a circular saw or table saw.
Confirm that all slats, the headrail, and the bottom rail are cut at the same length.

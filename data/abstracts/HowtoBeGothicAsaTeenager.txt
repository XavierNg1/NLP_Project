Think about it.
Go in to it slowly, start by searching the history, music, and fashion.
Go shopping.
Keep up with all your schoolwork.
Listen to goth music.
Do your hair how you want, there are many different styles to choose from, and you don't have to dye your hair black or a crazy colour (clip ins work just as fine).
If you can't wear makeup, it's not the end of the world.
If you can wear make-up, keep it simple when you start eye-shadow and a bit of eye-liner still looks great.
Live your life.

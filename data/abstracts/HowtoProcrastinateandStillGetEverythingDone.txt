Make a list.
Prioritize based on the date that by which each item must be completed.
If you don't have anything due in the next few hours, go have some fun.
If you do have something due in the next few hours, fear not.
Start something else.
Travel back and forth between the "productive" and the "fun".
At the last minute, finish up whatever you're supposed to be doing and finalize it (print it, clean it up, etc.
Turn it in!,
Take a brief nap because you probably didn't get any sleep.
Repeat steps 4-9 as necessary.

,
Go back to some fun stuff for a little while ... reanalyze your To Do list while you're at it.

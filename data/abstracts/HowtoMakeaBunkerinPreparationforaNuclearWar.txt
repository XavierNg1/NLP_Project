Ensure your house has a cellar.
Completely empty your cellar out, so it is totally empty.
Consider getting further insulation in your cellar.
Install bunks onto the walls of your cellar.
Keep a large store of food and water.
If you have a gun license or if legal in your area, keep a gun and ammunition in your cellar.
Make a good first aid kit in case you ever need to treat an injury, minor or major.
Collect some gas masks that are clean, safe and useable.
Put a few home comforts down there - the likelihood is that they will be all that survive if there is a nuclear war.

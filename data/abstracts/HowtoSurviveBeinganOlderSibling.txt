Try not to argue.
Keep your cool.
If you do have to argue, just stick to a few main things:


Always make eye contact when talking to the parent, showing that everything you're saying is 100% true.
Seek a truce.
Remember that you are older and you do have the right to be firm with younger siblings at times!,
Don't let siblings into your room.
If you share a room, claim your side of the room or your space.
Ask siblings to get out of your room with an aura of authority.

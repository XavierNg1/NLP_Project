Identify where Rockruff can be found.
Once you find a Rockruff, catch it.
Have your Rockruff gain experience.
Once your Rockruff reaches level 25 during the daytime in Pokémon Sun or during the nighttime in Pokémon Moon, it will evolve into either Midday Form Lycanroc (if you're playing Pokémon Sun) or Midnight Form Lycanroc (if you're playing Pokémon Moon).

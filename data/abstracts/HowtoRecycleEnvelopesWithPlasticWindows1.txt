Call your recycling service to ask if they recycle envelopes with plastic windows.
Research local recycling options, if you do not currently recycle.
Place your envelopes with plastic windows with the other paper recycling, if your recycling agency suggests.
Remove the plastic window from the inside, if your recycling agency cannot separate the plastic and glue from the envelope.

Wash the watermelon.
Slice the top 1/3 of the melon lengthwise, leaving about 2/3 of the melon on the bottom.
Cut out the flesh, leaving two 1” thick slices intact for cake.
Use a crinkle cutter or a knife, cut the remainder of fruit into desired, bite-sized shapes.
Draw CELEBRATE!, a person’s name, or other personalized message onto the front of the watermelon using your stencil and pen.
Fill the basket with the fruit mixture and place the “cake” (on a small dish or plate for stability) on top.
Finished.

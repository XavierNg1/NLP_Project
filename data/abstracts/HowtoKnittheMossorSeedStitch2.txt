Cast on the number of stitches that you will need to complete your project.
Do your first row by alternating between knitting one stitch and purling the next.
Check the stitch type before starting your second row.
Tackle the third row with the same stitch order that you did the second row.
Switch back to the stitch order of your first row, for the fourth row.
Repeat this four-row pattern until you're done with your garment or this part of your pattern.

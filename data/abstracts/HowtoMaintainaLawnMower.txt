Prior to starting, do a close visual inspection, cleaning out any debris, then:


Tighten or replace any loose nuts / bolts.
Remove the spark plug lead from the spark plug and move it away from cylinder head.
Position your mower.
Change or sharpen the blade, if needed.
Check the motor's "air filter" while doing this sort of maintenance.
Change the oil if needed.
Be aware of stale fuel.

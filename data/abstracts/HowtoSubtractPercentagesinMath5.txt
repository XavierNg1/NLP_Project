Assess what the problem is.
Convert the percentage to a decimal.
Multiply the decimal by the whole value.
Subtract the product from the whole value.
Alternatively, realize that a 30% discount means the price or value will represent the difference: 

 100%âˆ’30%{\displaystyle 100\%-30\%} = 70%{\displaystyle 70\%}

 The price will be 70% of the original price, so simply find 70% of $120 -- using the decimal equivalent 70% = 0.70 multiply the original price -- to get the discounted price.

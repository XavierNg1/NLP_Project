Buy ribbed knit binding at a craft store.
Place the inside crease of the binding around the raw outside edges of the fleece circle.
Pin the binding onto the edges, so that they stay until they are sewn in place.
Sew a top stitch through the bottom edges of the binding.
Measure 4 strips of binding so that they are 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) longer than the armhole measurement.
Unfold the bindings.
Measure and draw a 1.25 inch (3.2 cm) line through the center crease at each end.
Turn the armhole bindings right side out.
Pin the 2 sides of the bindings inside the arm holes.
Try on your fleece vest.

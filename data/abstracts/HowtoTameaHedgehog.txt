Ensure you have an African hedgehog, rather than a European one.
Make sure you can keep the hedgehog for seven years, which is the average lifespan.

Avoid buying a hedgehog if you have small children or you want a pet you can cuddle with.
Look for signs of tearing or crusting around the eyes, ears and nose.
Recognize normal behaviors, such as hissing and curling.
Buy all of your supplies, including a cage, food, water bottle, litter pan and bedding in advance.
Set the cage in a place where you frequent, such as a bedroom or a living room.
Place him in his cage for a few days.
Bring him out of the cage, but close to it and place him in your lap.
Feed him mealworms if he is still uncomfortable outside his cage.
Give your hedgehog a hiding space, such as an igloo, where he can hide.
Buy soft toys without internal stuffing.
Introduce a new thing to your hedgehog when there aren’t loud noises.
Consider adding a wheel, PVC piping or ferret tunnels to your system.
Handle your hedgehog every day.
Start litter training right when you bring your hedgehog home.
Place the animal in a clean cage or area.
Watch where your hedgehog decides to go to the bathroom.
Choose a litter pan like those used with ferrets.
Don’t give negative reinforcement, as it is unlikely to work.
Clean the litter pan regularly.
Don’t stop the hedgehog from using the bedding in the litter pan as a dust bath.

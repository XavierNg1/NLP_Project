Decide on box size(s) and how many you'll want to make.
Taking the shelf space measurements you wrote down in the step above, subtract about 1/4 or 1/8 inch (6.35mm or 3.17mm) from the height and width dimensions.
Plan out the dimensions for your boxes and determine how to minimize waste when cutting the foam core boards.
Using a yard-stick or other long ruler, measure out and mark the foam core boards with a pencil.
Use the X-Acto knife to cut the foam core boards.
Once you have all five sides of the box cut out, use the duct tape to connect the four sides to each other and then add the bottom on last.
Use the dimensions of the front-side of your box and cut the thinner poster board to this size.
Now comes the fun part!,
Measure and draw out a template for each book spine on the poster board fronts so you can plan everything out.
Plan on one book in the center of the box to be 1" (2.5cm) wide and make it about 1/2" (1.27cm) shorter than the others.
Once you have your plan in place, select which papers you want to use for each book spine.
Measure out the width of the first book on the scrap-book paper adding about 1/4" (6.35mm) on both sides that will get folded under to glue to the poster board.
Using a ruler held against the back of the piece of paper lined up with the fold line, press down on table to get a straight crease across the strip.
Draw out your title design on the folded paper.
Apply glue to the backs of the folds and apply to the poster board front panel aligning the outer edges as best possible.
Begin working on the third book by skipping every other book and glue them down as you finish them.

,
Go back and do the remaining middle books.
Once all the glue is dry, attach the faux book to the box you made earlier by gluing it on.
Cut out the finger hole in the foam core board above the short center "book.",
Your finished box should fit perfectly into your shelf space and easily pull out using the finger hole/notch.

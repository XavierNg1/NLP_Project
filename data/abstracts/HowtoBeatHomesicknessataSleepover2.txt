Make sure you have everything you need plus something from home like a pillow, blanket, or stuffed animal, when you are going to a sleepover.
Pack enough so your host isn't having to wash something for you, or you don't have to borrow anything.
Make sure you look carefully over the list of things to bring if you are at camp.

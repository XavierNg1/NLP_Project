Recognize that, according to The Bible, you are a sinner and have fallen short of God's standard.
You must come to the Biblical understanding that Christ died for you, and that his death on the cross was his paying the penalty for your sins and mine.
According to Christianity consistent with the Bible you must repent and turn away from your sins once and for all.
Get yourself a Bible and start reading it.
Find yourself a church that believes in salvation through repentance and faith in Jesus alone as opposed to an alternative tradition and see which would bring agreement and peace in faith.
Talk to a pastor, or any other kind of Christian, such as a spiritual leader -- and tell him about the decision you have just made for Christ, and get Baptised to publicly proclaim the spiritual transformation and faith you now have.

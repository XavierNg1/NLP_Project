Consult the Land Registry for land in England or Wales.
Search by address.
Do a map search.
Ask for a search of the index map to double check if a property is registered.
Include a plan if the property does not have a postal description, or if there is doubt as to the extent of the property.
Submit your index map search application online or via mail.
Remember that just because a property is not registered, does not mean it is not owned.

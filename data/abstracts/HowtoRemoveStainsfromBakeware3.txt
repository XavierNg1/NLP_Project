Use water and vinegar.To clean aluminum baking trays, pots, and other bakeware, mix water and vinegar in equal amounts.
Use salt and lemon slices.If you don’t want to clean your aluminum bakeware with vinegar and water, slice a lemon lengthwise into four equally-sized wedges.
Use cream of tartar.If salted lemon slices and vinegar alone don’t work against your stained aluminum bakeware, you could try a cream of tartar cleaner.

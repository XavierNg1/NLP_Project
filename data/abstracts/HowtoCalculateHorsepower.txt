Get your car’s torque numbers.
Find your car’s engine speed.
Multiply the torque by the engine speed.
Divide the product by 5,252.
Figure out the current (I), efficiency (Eff), and voltage (V) of the motor.The voltage of the motor will be expressed in volts, the current will be expressed in amps, and the efficiency will be expressed as a percentage.
Using the formula (V * I * Eff)/746=HP, determine your electric motor’s horsepower.
Weigh yourself.
Find a stairway that is free from obstructions.
Measure the total height of the stairs.First, find the height of one stair in feet.Then, count how many stairs are in the stairwell you will be running up.
Time how long it takes you to run up the stairs.
Use the formula (m*9.81*h)/t=HP to calculate your watts.
Calculate your Horsepower.

Get your aquarium.
For your main filtration, use an all-natural method.
Place the tank in a good location.
Use the correct type of water to fill the tank.
Proceed to fill the tank with water and add salt, following the manufacturers directions for adding the salt.

,
Keep adding salt until the specific gravity is 1.023.
Put in the heater.
Place the live rock in first, using an open pattern so the fish have room to swim through and hide in the rock.
You must then cycle the aquarium in order to avoid any livestock death.
When your aquarium has fully completed cycling and you're confident all water parameters look stable, you will be ready to add a fish and a coral.
Make sure to do your homework and research the species of fish and coral you're thinking of keeping; (try to offer them foods they would get naturally from the ocean).

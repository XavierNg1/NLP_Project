Focus.
Allow someone to pass, if you happen to see them going beyond the speed limit.
Use your turn signals, and use them at the right time.
Never switch lanes when in the middle of an intersection.
NEVER try to "beat the light.",
Keep in mind that it is courteous to allow a vehicle to turn into traffic if the driver is waiting for a break.
Remember: maintaining a decently comfortable distance between you and the driver ahead of you is an excellent rule of thumb.
Note that residential areas are common grounds for children to run spontaneously into the streets without looking for oncoming cars.
Remember that trucks often give their drivers difficulty stopping, turning, or backing up, we, as drivers, have all witnessed this.
Be courteous of the senior citizens, as well.
Make an effort to change lanes when safe if you see utility work, police and emergency vehicles up ahead, or see a lane starting to slow down to a crawl while the opposite lanes are open or have less traffic.
Understand that the majority of drivers just aim to get to their destination, just like everyone else does.
If you are signaled to stop by the police, be nice to the officer and they may let you go despite violating a traffic law.
Don't use the shoulder or median to get around people not moving with traffic.

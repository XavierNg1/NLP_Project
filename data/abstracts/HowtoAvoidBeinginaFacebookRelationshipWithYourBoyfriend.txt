Be up front with your boyfriend.
Explain how keeping your love life offline will be better for the relationship.
If being up front scares you, ignore his requests to be in relationship and act like you never got them.
Make one of your friends your 'husband'.
Be blase and a little snobby about it.
Don't be listed as single.
Be willing to listen.
Seriously consider his request.
Be realistic.

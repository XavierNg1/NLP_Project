Determine the size and amounts of plant stake you need.
Strike the stake about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) away from the plant's stem into the ground by using a hammer or mallet.
Secure the stake to the plant with non-wired plant ties, nylon stockings, or strong wool.
Check on your plants regularly, and apply additional ties when the plans grow.

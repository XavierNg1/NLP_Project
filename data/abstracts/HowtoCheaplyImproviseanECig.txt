Collect 3 "D" (or 4 "C") batteries (laid end to end in a line) and a length of electrical wire which exceeds the total length of the batteries by a few inches.
Strip the insulation from the wire's ends.
Form a flat spiral disc with the 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of exposed wire (see picture).
Fasten the spiral end of the wire to the (-) terminal of one of the batteries.
Cut the cardboard tube lengthwise.
Put the battery (the one with the wire already attached) into the tube with the negative terminal facing down towards the folded end.
Make a male electrical connector for the ecig cartridge (you may be able to skip this step if your cartridge already has a male connector).
Connect the alligator clip to the outer ring terminal of the cartridge.

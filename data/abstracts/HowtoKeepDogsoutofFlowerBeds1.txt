Fence in your flower beds.
Consider growing barrier plants.Tall, thorny, or especially fragrant plants can be a great deterrent for dogs.
Make your flower beds unappealing by adding tastes and smells that dogs don't like.Dust the edges of your flower beds with red pepper powder or other pungent spices.
Locate flower beds in inaccessible areas.
Switch to container gardening if your flowers are getting repeatedly trampled.Dogs are less likely to get into pots or raised beds, as access it inherently more limited than flat areas of a yard.

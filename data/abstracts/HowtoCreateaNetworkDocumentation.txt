Work out the format.
Think what information you need to collect in that documentation; suggestions could be: number of physical locations (where your company works), how those locations are connected (wireless, wired), number of routers, switches, firewalls, servers in each location (with passwords, types of operating systems, update management, types of hardware, types of RAID, period of guarantee offered by vendors for hardware and software, rules in firewall), a contact list with people responsible with administration, help desk, a contact list with companies that offers support for hardware and software, documented and tested procedures for disaster / recovery scenarios, places to store backups (on site and off site), procedures for trial restores.

Improve compliance.

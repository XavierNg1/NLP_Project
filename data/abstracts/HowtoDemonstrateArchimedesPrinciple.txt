Put a medium bowl inside a large bowl.
Fill the medium bowl to the brim with water.
Place a small, floatable wooden object on a gram scale and note the measurement.
Place the wood in the water.
Place another, separate container on the gram scale and note the measurement.
Remove the wood from the medium bowl, then remove the medium bowl from the large bowl.
Pour the spilled water from the large bowl into the container on the scale and note the measurement.

,
Subtract the mass of the container (Step 5) from the combined mass of the water and the container (Step 7).
Compare the mass of the spilled water with the mass of the wood (Step 3).
Repeat the experiment with a non-floatable object such as a rock.

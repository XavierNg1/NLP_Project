Use a sod-cutting spade or tree-planter's dibble to cut the lawn in the desired shape of your flower bed.
Remove the sods: Cut the sod into pieces.
Dig a trench at the edge of your line: The trench should be as deep as your plastic lawn edging PLUS 2.5 cm.
Unroll your plastic lawn edging and cut to the desired length.
Go against the curl of the edging, slide it into the trench, placing it on the grass side of the trench so that the top of the edging is just level with the base of the growing grass.
Use soil (back fill your trench) to hold the edging in place as you work in sections along the length of your flower bed.

,
If your desired edge line is wavy, you may need lawn edging stakes to hold the edging in a curve.
Tamp down the backfill immediately adjacent to the edging using your foot sideways (compact the soil).
Know that if the grass tries to invade from the top, just pull it up.

Lay squid on a sheet of newspaper.
Put on rubber or latex gloves.
Grasp the squid's head right behind the eyes where it joins the mantle.
Reach into the mantle, which now resembles an empty sack.
Gently scrape the outer surface of the mantle with a sharp knife.
Cut the mantle into rings by slicing vertical to the line of the squid's back.
Fold the newspaper around the unwanted squid parts, and dispose.

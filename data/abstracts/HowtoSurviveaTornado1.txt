Move immediately to an underground shelter whenever possible.
If unable to go underground, stay in a windowless, interior room on the lowest possible floor.
Know where NOT to seek shelter.
Remain in your shelter until the danger of tornadoes has passed.
Exit your shelter carefully, and exercise caution moving around in a tornado stricken area.

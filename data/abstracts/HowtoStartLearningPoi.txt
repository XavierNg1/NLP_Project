Poi can be either made or purchased.
Slip the looped ends of the rope over your hands.
The ideal place to practice poi is either outside in good weather, or in an open space with a high ceiling indoors.

,
Hold your arms down by your sides and swing both poi to get a bit of momentum going, slowly(about a second a rotation, it doesn't sound slow but its very tempting to try to go faster, at which point its harder to control) rotate your wrists so the ball spins forward.
WEAVING: the most basic trick.
Once you feel you have mastered this repeat with the other poi.
This basic weave is the basis of many other tricks so once you've mastered that you're off to a flying start.

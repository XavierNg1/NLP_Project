Spread through the deck and have a spectator select a card.
Perform a Marlo Tilt while you are distracting them with the story.
Ask them to snap their fingers, and perform a double-lift.Ask them to snap their fingers once more, and simply reveal the top card.
(Optional Step) If you can perform the pass, riffle your thumb down the side of the deck and tell them to tell you when to stop.
Catch a thumb break (hold your hand palm down with the deck between your fingers, and have the bottom card separated from the one above it by your thumb).
Place the top card of the left deck on top of the right deck, but off center, and place the left deck on top of the right deck.
Get their card to be the second one from the top again.
Ask them to snap their fingers, and you double-lift the top two cards, revealing that their card "is on the top".
Repeat step 6.
Wait for them to snap their fingers, and if they see you with the card in your mouth, they laugh.
While they are surprised at the whole card-in-the-mouth thing, bring the deck (which should be in your left hand) down to your left thing, and use your thumb to push the top card against your thigh and flip it over, so it's face-up.
Grab one end of both cards, and fold the cards gently.
Ask them to snap their fingers again.
End the trick with something astonishing, something that demonstrates your prowess as a magician.

Respond in a timely manner.If someone that you’re not interested in asks you out over a text message, email, or instant messaging, it can be tempting to put off responding to him.
Use “I” statements.When you reject someone, using “I” statements can help keep the rejection about you, so the guy you’re speaking with doesn’t feel insulted or put down.
Use proper text etiquette.If you are too informal when you’re telling the man who asked you out that you’re not interested, you can come across as rude.
Stay honest.

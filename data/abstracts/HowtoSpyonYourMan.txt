Question what your man is telling you.
Make his phone your best friend.
Check to see if he has social media or snap chat.
Check if he takes his phone with him to the bathroom and safe guards it all day.

,
Does he go to sleep and let his phone die so that he won't have to worry about you going through it while he sleeps?,
Check and see if the numbers in his phone are really the people that he has them saved under!,
Consider, does he always stay on late at work on certain days and is he always picking up shifts supposedly?,
Find out if he goes to the bars every week.
Put an old cell phone in his car or tape recorder under their seat in their car and they will never know that you are listening to their conversation.
Don't drive yourself crazy and go commando on them.
At the end of the day, you decide what you want to do but remember a man will disrespect you only if you allow him to!,
Remember, to catch a player, you have to be a player".

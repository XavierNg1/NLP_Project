Wash and cut the asparagus.
Fill a large casserole dish with 1 to 2 tablespoons of water.
Pack 2 to 3 layers of asparagus in the dish.
Cover the casserole dish with a sheet of plastic wrap.
Poke a few vent holes into the plastic wrap using a fork or knife.
Put the dish into the microwave and heat it on high for 2 to 4 minutes.
Remove the dish from the microwave and lift the plastic wrap off.
Consider wrapping stalks of asparagus in 4 sheets of damp paper towels if you are only making one or two servings.

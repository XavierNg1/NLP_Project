If you are learning to play the piano, the chances are that you learn to read the right hand music (treble clef) quite quickly, but then struggle with the left hand music (bass clef).
The point is that the black lines are GBDF in both hands (and the red ones ACE).
Another problem that arises later on is reading notes on ledger lines - the short lines above the treble clef or below the bass clef.

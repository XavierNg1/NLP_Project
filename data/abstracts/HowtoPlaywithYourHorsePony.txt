Make sure that the arena/field that you are using is empty.
Get your horse ready.
Lead your horse/pony into the arena and unclip the lead rope.
Develop a bit of a feel for how much your horse/pony likes to play, what they do if you pick up a whip, etc.
Move toward the middle of the ring.
Start running with your horse/pony.
If your pony/horse is in the mood, you can add a jump to jump (but don't start forcing him/her to jump).

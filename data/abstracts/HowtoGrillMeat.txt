Turn on your grill or your gas cooker on (either turn on the gas and ignite, or put coals in the bottom and light).
While you are waiting for your grill to heat up, take your pieces of meat and tenderize it using a tenderizing hammer.

,
Season your meat using any type of seasoning that suits your taste.
Lay the meat down on the grill and do not move it until grill lines/brown caramelization (specifically called the "Maillard reaction") occurs on the entire surface.

Turn the meat over using a spatula.
Remove the meat when it's almost done to your liking.
Finished.

Before you make any risky moves, take a step back and review your past with her.
If you feel positive energy flowing between the two of you, you can move onto the romance!,
If you sense negative energy, she may not be the one for you.
Once you've decided if you want to pursue her or not, slowly start to drop hints that you have a crush on her.
Try flirting a little with her, but make sure you are close with her, or you may be souring things between you and her.
Let your hands brush hers.
Have a close, trusted friend eavesdrop on her conversations with her friends to see if she talks about you.
Once you feel confident enough, tell her that you like her.
Only tell her that you like her if you sense that she may like you.
If it's clear that she has no feelings for you, do not pursue her any longer.
If she blushes and smiles shyly, she may have feelings for you as well!

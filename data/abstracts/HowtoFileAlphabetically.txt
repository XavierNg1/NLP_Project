Decide on the alphabetical system you will use.
Group items.
Index your files.
Order files alphabetically according to their indexed name.
Label your file folders.
Document the indexing and filing system.
File new items properly.
File items under their significant term.
Order names by surname.
Ignore articles, conjunctions, and prepositions.Articles (such as “a,” “an,” and “the”), conjunctions (such as “and,” “but,” and “or”), and prepositions (such as “for,” “of,” and “in”) are generally skipped when indexing and filing alphabetically, since they are not considered significant terms.
Treat abbreviations as though they were spelled out.When indexing and filing items, you may encounter abbreviations such as “Mfg.” (for “Manufacturing”) or “Inc.” (for “Incorporated).
File numerals ordinarily.
Deal with any special characters.
Use the general rule “nothing before something” when necessary.
Distinguish files by more detailed information, when necessary.In rarer cases, alphabetic information is not enough to determine the order of files.
Publicize exceptions and special rules.Make sure that everyone who uses your files knows about any exceptions to standard guidelines that are factored into your filing system.

Brush your hair.
Gather your hair into a ponytail.
Hold the pony tail in place with your left hand.
Pull the twist around your left hand (still holding your hair in place) in a clockwise direction with your right hand.
Push the chopstick (pointy end up) through the bottom left side of the bun diagonally using your right hand.
Push the pointy end toward your scalp, holding the blunt end in your right hand.
Gently let go of your hair and take a look at the final result.
Add finishing touches (optional) and your hairstyle is complete!

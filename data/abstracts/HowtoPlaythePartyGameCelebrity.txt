Split the room into two teams.
Hand each person 4-10 small pieces of paper (depending on the skill of the group), about 2" by 3" and a pen or pencil.
Collect all paper pieces (for example if there are 10 people playing there will be 40-100 celebrity names) and put them in a large container.
Put all celebrity names back into the container for ROUND TWO.
Put all celebrity names back into the container for ROUND THREE.
Add up the total of all three rounds for both teams.

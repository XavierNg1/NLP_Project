Verify that you truly want to go through with this.
Write down your reasons for the breakup.
Arrange to meet in a semi-public place.
Use “I” statements to explain why you are breaking up with her.
Avoid blame.
Give her an opportunity to respond by actively listening.
Refrain from saying “It’s not you, it’s me.” Avoiding blame all together is a much better approach to breaking things without hurting the other person more than the break up may already hurt them.
Break up in person--not over the phone or email.
Save the offer of friendship, as doing so could be even more insulting.
Do not reach out to her.
Steer clear of places where you know she might be to give her space.
Be cordial if you must see the other person regularly.
Prepare a short, neutral response to others about the breakup.
Delay making a new relationship public for some time.

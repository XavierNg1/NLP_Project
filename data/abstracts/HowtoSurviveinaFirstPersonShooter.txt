Never run into an open space without checking for snipers or enemies first.
Don't fool around with explosives.
Unless you are a sniper, never stand still in one place.
Make sure no enemies are following you.
"It is better to die together, than to die alone".
Don't fire.
Don't talk unless you're dead already.
Save your money so you can buy a better gun.
Reload more often.
Don't hold the fire button too long.
Sprint only when you are safe.
Be patient, know that some players are better than you and will always be better than you.

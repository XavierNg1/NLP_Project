You know how StarClan cats give prophecies?,
Start with simple prophecies, not like the professional ones that Spottedleaf gives, and make them easy to fulfill unless you're trying to do a professional clan.
Read books that are mainly about StarClan, and look for details about StarClan.
Don't forget, you don't have to always do prophecy-related stuff.
Get a warrior name and Clan.
Don't use a ridiculous warrior names like Grabbypan or Collarbiter.
StarClan cats usually have small stars in their fur.
Don't say shortcut words like "I'll, Don't, C'mon," and all that stuff.
Always speak kind, loyal, and mysteriously.
Don't EVER speak TwolegSpeak!

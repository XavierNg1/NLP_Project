Measure out your tiling plans in advance, getting all of your dimensions and marking problem areas like sinks.
Remove the sink, stove, and any other appliances.
Prepare the tile countertop base if not purchasing or using a preexisting counter.
Use your plywood template to cut the concrete backer boards with a wet saw.
Screw the plywood base into the countertop, then adhere the concrete board with thinset mortar and an electric drill.
Alternatively, cut and sand down laminate countertops to adhere tiles to them.
Mark out a backsplash, or set of tiles along the corner of the counter and wall, if you want one.

Understand that this dye stains.
Part your hair in half horizontally and put the top half up.
Let down the rest of your hair and part vertically applying each one at a time.
Let it dry slightly so that the mixture isn't dripping.
Take a plastic cover and cover your head with it and use the ends to tie it securely.
Take a thin towel, or an old large t-shirt (both should be alright to stain) and secure on top of the plastic bag.
Place an old t-shirt or towel (that can be stained) over your pillow incase the wrap falls off in the middle of the night.

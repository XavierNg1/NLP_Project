Have your hair buzzed down to a "zero" with clippers.
Shave your head down smooth.
Get your head soaked with Hot, but not boiling water.
Apply shaving gel or foam & make sure you apply it liberally all over your scalp.
Next, being very careful, shave in the direction of hair growth or as it is fairly commonly known as, "shaving with the grain".
After the shave, make sure that you rinse your head with cold water.
Apply post-shave balm / moisturiser.
The next step is maintenance: To keep your head smooth, it is advisable to shave your head every day just as you would normally shave your face every day.

Finally, for your initial head shave it would be advisable to have a barber or hairdresser do the deed.

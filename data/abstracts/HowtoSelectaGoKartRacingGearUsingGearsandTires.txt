Most racers know about gear ratio and gear ratio charts are listed in numerous places.
But in order to get a true picture of gear ratio one must use tire circumference in equation.
To figure IPR use this equation: Rear Tire Circumference(T) x clutch gear(C) divided by rear gear(R) = IPR.
Even though both these racers were using the same gears they were not running an equal set-up.
So remember, if you ask someone what gears they are using and you don't also ask what size their tires are, you are wasting your time.

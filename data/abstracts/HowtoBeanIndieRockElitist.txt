Seek out influential indie albums (regardless of whether or not you enjoy them).
When you run out of influential albums, try for the most impressively obscure recordings available.
Choose one or two bands (of course, the more obscure, the better) to latch yourself onto.
If you're successful, fellow elitist wannabes will begin to agree with you.
Establish yourself in your community as an expert on every music-related topic (it doesn't matter whether or not you really know what you're talking about).
If you're an introverted kind of person (many elitists are), do not fret!,
If possible, you may want to become associated with a group of like-minded elitists.
As your evolution begins to take place, it's important to begin using new techniques to distinguish yourself.Alternatively, join the Indie Rock Club at your school

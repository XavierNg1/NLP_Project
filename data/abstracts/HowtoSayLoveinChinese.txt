The phrase for saying "I love you" in Chinese, in pinyin, is "wo ai ni" or 我爱你 in calligraphy.
The third tone in wo means that the sound is pronounced with the tone first going down, then up.
The fourth tone just goes down and doesn't come back up, unlike the third tone, so ai should be pronounced like you're slashing a knife downwards.
Ni is, again, the third tone so the sound should go up and down like for wo.

DO NOT smoke in your house (unless you live with smokers).
When smoking outside, stay far, far away from the house.
Keep friends that smoke.
Keep your cigarettes and lighters hidden, but relatively easy to get to, and not easy to be spotted messing with them.
Avoid colognes and body sprays.
Stay upwind from the smoke.
If you're going to smoke in the car, buy an air freshener, make sure your A/C isn't on cycle (as that will keep the smell of smoke in the air system for ages to come,) point your vents towards the windows, keep all of your windows down, and keep the cigarette out the window.

While it is the most desired method, taking a shower at random times of the day to remove the smell is a bit suspicious, so when you come in from smoking, change your shirt, wash your hands, and brush your teeth.
Use common sense and heaping spoonfuls of caution.

Determine your shoe needs and budget limits.
Choose an evening or late afternoon to do your shoe shopping.
Plan to spend at least an hour or two trying on shoes.
Wear the right kind of socks or stockings, or bring some along, for the kind of shoes you are shopping for.
When you get to the store, make friendly eye contact with the clerks.
Find a style you like in the approximate size you wear.
Try on the pair of shoes.
Never buy a pair of shoes that aren't perfectly comfortable in the store!,
Find out about frequent buyer cards or promotions, but don't let that dictate your choice of shoes or the store.
Remember that people look at your face and your smile much more than what you're wearing on your feet.

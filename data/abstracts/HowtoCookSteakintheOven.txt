Preheat your oven to 450° F (232° C).
Start off with relatively thick steaks.
Wipe away any moisture from all sides of the steak.
Salt your steak.
Oil a cast iron skillet or other oven-safe pan with a nice coating of neutral oil and begin to heat it on a burner over high heat.
Pat off any excess moisture from your steak a final time and carefully place it in the cast iron skillet.
Continue cooking the steak on high for 2-3 minutes.
Flip the steak and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes over high heat.
Add a little butter to the pan right before you're ready to put the steak into the oven (optional).
Keeping the steak in the same cast iron skillet, place it in the oven and cook for approximately 6 to 8 minutes.
Use a cooking thermometer to exactly time the steak's escape from the oven.
Be sure to let your steak rest for 7 to 10 minutes after removing it from the oven.
Enjoy your perfectly cooked steak.

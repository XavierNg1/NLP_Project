Preflight: It’s common to have everything planned out and ready to go, and then have the weather to start to sink.

Take-off: A pilot should avoid intersection take-offs.

Know your duties In-flight: A pilot has three priorities when they are flying: to aviate, navigate, and communicate – and in that order.

Prepare for Arrival: Prior to arriving at the destination, the pilot has several things to think about and coordinate.

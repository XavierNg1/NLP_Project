Do long runs for training on weekends.
Continue to run slower than your usual clocked marathon pace.
Training on hills, whether the hill is steep or just a bit of an incline, adds leg-muscle strength.
Know that hill training is very demanding at first because you are using muscles that you rarely use when just straight running.
Understand that marathon training should balance three kinds of speed work as well as long distance running, being well hydrated and resting.

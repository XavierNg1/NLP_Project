Avoid focusing too much on the one-on-one aspect of offense, rather than the team aspect.
Be a part of the game, instead of standing around and watching the action.
Learn when it is appropriate to make a pass or take the shot.
Look for more than one option on every play.
Make smart passes.
Keep your cool -- don't commit a cheap and foolish foul after making a mistake.
Know your teammates' ability levels.
Be aware of how much time is left on the game clock or shot clock.
Maintain your concentration throughout each offensive possession.
Don't stay at the same speed the whole game; if you do your defender will always know how fast you will go.

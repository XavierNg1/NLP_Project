Remove your puff pastry from the fridge or freezer and begin working immediately.
Sprinkle a generous coating of cinnamon sugar on the rolling surface.
Flatten the dough with a rolling pin to 1/8 - 1/4 of an inch thickness.
Use a pastry brush to coat the top side in egg wash. An egg wash is simply a cracked egg whisked together so that the yolk and white are combined.
Generously sprinkle the top of the pastry dough with the remaining half of cinnamon sugar.
Roll up one-half of the pastry towards the middle.
Roll up the other side until the two rolls meet in the middle.
Roll the whole thing in plastic wrap and put in the fridge for 15 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 450ÂºF while the dough chills.
Remove the roll and cut it into 3/4-inch slices.
Cook the pastries for 4-5 minutes on one side, or until golden brown, then flip them.

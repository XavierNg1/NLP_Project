Make sure you know how to speak in present tense otherwise it'll be very difficult.
Learn that there are 2 different ways of speaking past tense - Passé composé and Imparfait.
Passé composé is relatively easy.
First, write down the conjugations of the verb avoir: j'ai, tu as, il a, nous avons, vous avez and ils ont.
For all the other verb groups this is the same with the exception of the endings.
For Imparfait, it is even easier.
This is the same for all groups.

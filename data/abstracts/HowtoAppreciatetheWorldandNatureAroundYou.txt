Spend time with nature and broaden your views.
Be interested in things you'd normally be disgusted in.
Appreciate all plants.
Look up at the sky.
Look around at the water.
Rainbows are another thing to appreciate.
Find the time to look around cities and at people, too.
Remember that everything is beautiful in some way.
Take time out just to laze around in your garden or anywhere outside.

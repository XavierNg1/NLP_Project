Select the area of the house where you want the tank to be.
Buy the largest aquarium that will fit in your space, or the largest aquarium your budget will allow.
Choose between acrylic or glass.
Choose your lighting: Metal halide lamps provide the best lighting for most of the corals commonly kept, other forms of lighting are also obtainable and offer varying degrees of success.
Other types of lights to consider are fluorescent lighting, specifically high intensity fluorescents.
Set up the filtration: On a smaller tank (less than 40 gallons) regular weekly water changes can be used in place of a skimmer.
Adjust the flow: Now is time to get a saltwater rated pump to return the water from your sump to the main tank.
Place a heater(s) in your sump, or the rear chambers of your tank.

Consider using an aquarium chiller.
Fill the tank with tap water partially to test for leaks.
Prepare enough artificial seawater for the volume needed.
Once you mix your saltwater and fill your aquarium, turn on all your pumps and let the water 'rest' for a day.
Another way to go is not to add sand at all.
Add 'live rock' and arrange to your liking, approximately 20% of your volume.
Let the tank "cycle": This means you will need to wait until the water tests negative for ammonia and nitrite.
Add cleaning creatures such as snails and small hermit crabs, and finally reef fish.
Many aquarists feel its not proper to add corals and anemones until the tank is a few months old.

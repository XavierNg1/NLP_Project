Take out a sheet of newspaper.
Take a half of the newspaper and divide it into another half so that when you roll them, it won't become too big!

,
Use a dowel or broom stick to roll the paper up into a tube.
Make 8 rolls in total.
Make 4 notebook paper rolls.
Take any color paper you want.
Glue the drawing or picture to the cardboard backing.

,
Add the paper rolls to the image.
Trim off any remaining cardboard if it's showing.

,
Cover any holes between the rolls by sticking flowers (plastic or paper) over the top.
Done.

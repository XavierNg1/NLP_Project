Lay out the area of concrete to be cut.
Use a 15-amp circular saw with a diamond or abrasive blade to cut a depth of 2 inches (50.8 mm).
Employ a gasoline or electric powered cut-off saw to get the job done when working with concrete deeper than 4 inches (101.6 mm).
Follow the same steps as you did in the use of a circular saw and identify your starting point.

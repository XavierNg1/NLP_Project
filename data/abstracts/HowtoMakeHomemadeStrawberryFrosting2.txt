Purée the strawberries and the sugar.
Pour the purée through a fine, mesh sieve into a medium-sized saucepan.
Cook the strawberry purée for 10 to 15 minutes.
Chill the strawberry purée, then set aside 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters) for your frosting.
Cream the butter and cream cheese together until smooth, about 30 seconds.
Beat in the powdered sugar, ½ cup (65 grams) at a time.
Add the salt, then beat until the frosting is light and fluffy.
Add in the strawberry purée and vanilla extract, and beat again until evenly combined.
Use the frosting right away, or refrigerate it.

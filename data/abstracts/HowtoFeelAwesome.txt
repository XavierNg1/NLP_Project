Tell the truth.
Live in the now.
Think about how much you have.
Change your views of yourself.
Feel bad once in a while.
Get moving.
But take a minute to be still.
Eat fresh and healthy.
Energize your diet, too.
Give your body enough sleep.
Get outside.
Get all fancy.
Nestle yourself firmly into a community.
Surprise yourself from time to time.
Use technology and the media only to feel good.
Develop the habit of helping others.
Do what speaks to you.

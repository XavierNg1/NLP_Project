Have a good diving technique.
Work the backstroke and breaststroke, and bring the freestyle home.
When you get to the wall, touch it with 2 hands and quickly flip over onto your back.
To switch to breaststroke, count your strokes again from the flags into the wall, and when you touch the wall, just turn around and start doing breaststroke.
When you get to the wall, turn and start your last 50 freestyle.

Divert the river.
Lay the foundations for the dam.
Add material until your dam is the height you want it to be.
Reinforce the downstream side of your dam with heavy canvas, nets, timber, girders, etc (depending on the size of the river) - this helps to prevent it shifting and/or collapsing under the weight of water it's gonna have to take.

,
If you've got concrete, concrete all over the dam and reinforcements, and let it dry.
Carefully close off the first diversion channel.

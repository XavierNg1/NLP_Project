To learn your computer keyboard better, open a blank microsoft word document.
Now use your fingers above and below to reach to the other keys while keeping your fingers on the ‘home row’ only.
You can type alphabets, numbers and anything you want using all the keys.
Most important thing: don’t look at your keyboard while typing.

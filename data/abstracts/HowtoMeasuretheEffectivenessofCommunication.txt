Hear the responses listeners give you.
Don't take yourself, or your ideas, too seriously.
Make sure you aren't equating agreement with understanding.
Be clear and concise.
Speak clearly.
Remain calm.
Respect the viewpoint of others.
Ask your co-workers and friends if they see you as an effective communicator; better yet, ask your boss.

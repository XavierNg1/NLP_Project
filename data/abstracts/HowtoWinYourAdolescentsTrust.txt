Once your child begins to question formerly innocuous commands, challenge your knowledge, and thwart all pressure to behave, recognize that you are now dealing with an adolescent.
Adolescents like information, explanation and justification for things they are asked to do.
Parental guidelines that are consistent, let teens know the consequences of behaviors before they are surprised by a punishment.
It is true that you cannot quarrel over everything, or each day will become problematic.
Become the best listener.
Be honest.
Apologize when you say something unkind, or accuse them unfairly.
Teens think their parents are all-knowing, so you can surprise them by offering to look up an answer to their question and get back to them.
Notice what your teenager is interested in and show interest when they discuss it.
Give them enough room to make their own mistakes.
Lastly, be truthful and only make promises you can keep.

Open a new spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel.
As an example, convert 40/31 to a continued fraction.
Consider the quadratic equation, Equation : x^2 - bx - 1 = 0.
Write an expansion of the form Equation as Expression : to avoid the cumbersome staircase notation.
Determine how long a continued fraction might be.
Let's study pi in particular, now that it has been learned that continued fractions reveal much more than do simple decimal representations of the same numbers.
Enter the formula into cell B31, without quotes, "=A30+1/A31".
Enter the formula into cell B30, without quotes, "=A29+1/B31".
Copy cell B30 to cell range B10:B29.
If you like, figure out the cfe's for each cell from B31 to B10.
Now check sqrt(2), sqrt(3), e and create your own patterns, which is probably pretty exciting for some of you!,Save the worksheet as Approach 1, or similar fitting name, and save the file as Continued Fractions, or similar filename.

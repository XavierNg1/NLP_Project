Start noticing when you laugh after people's comments, especially the clearly not funny comments.
Consider how others view your constant laugh, especially given that it comes at the tail-end of their usually ordinary comments.
Discern between the annoying, nervous laugh and the good, genuine laugh.
Become more assertive.
Find constructive ways to cope until you've overcome the habit of laughing at the end of everyone's comments.
Provide genuine outlets to release your laughter.

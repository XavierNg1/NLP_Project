Figure out the basic materials you will need.
Decide how large you are going to make your banjo.
Mark two circles the diameter you want the banjo's body to be.
Scribe a line about 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) inside your first cut, so the finished plywood will form a ring.
Sand or otherwise fit the two plywood rings so that they match closely.
Attach two stacked spacer blocks at 5 or 6 locations around one of your rings, then place the other ring on top, and fasten through the top ring and spacers into the bottom ring using wood screws, and preferably, wood glue.
Cut a piece of finished grade plywood to fit one side of your sound box.
Cut a piece of 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) Masonite composite sheeting or other material to wrap this assembly.
Cut your banjo's neck from a piece of 2X4 lumber.
Cut out the end piece for the banjo neck, tapering it from about 2 inches (5.1 cm) to 3 inches (7.6 cm) in with, 1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) in thickness, 4 or 4 1⁄2 inches (10.2 or 11.4 cm) long.
Stretch the drum material over the face of the sound box, tacking or screwing the material you use to side.
Attach eye screws at the end piece of the neck for the number of strings you intend to use.
Cut lengths of string for stringing the instrument.
Cut blocks of wood about 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) wide and 2 inches (5.1 cm) or so long, for frets, tapering them so the tops will be narrow when they are attached to the banjo neck.
Cut an extra block in the previous step to attach to the diaphragm .
Sand or use a block plane to smooth and/or round any rough edges that will be exposed, then finish the wood with stain and varnish, paint, plastic decals, or any other method you choose.
Tune and play around with your banjo, keeping in mind that the original instruments were made from gourds and bamboo limbs, with animal skin thongs for strings, fashioned with hand tools, and evolved into the chrome and lacquer descendants you see in professional musician's hands today.

Avoid unnecessary stress: Resign gracefully and leave things with your old employer on good terms; so, you can move on to your next endeavor without burning bridges.
Consider talking to your manager in person, about your intentions.
Avoid blindsiding them with an unexpected email.
Don't be intimidated, but be polite and professional, above all.
Follow business email format.
Leave your manager feeling warmly toward you, rather than angry about your resignation, by maintaining a friendly tone.
Leave gracefully.
Beware of leaving without giving notice.

Rivet Heads, or Industrial Goths, often do not consider themselves “Goths,” although their preferred music and fashion can be found in the same shops and they’ll happily go to Goth clubs.
However, in the modern era the Industrial scene has come to resemble a dark, rough, dystopian version of the Cyber scene.
Industrial fashion is somewhat like Cyber in its futuristic appearance but is generally more monochrome, less polished and often has a military influence.

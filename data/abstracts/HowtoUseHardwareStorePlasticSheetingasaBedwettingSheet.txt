Go to a hardware store such as Ace, Lowes, or Home Depot and purchase a roll of plastic sheeting.
Once you get the roll of plastic home you'll need a utility knife or pair of scissors to cut the plastic sheet.

,
When you cover the bed with the plastic, place it directly on top of the box spring.
You also have to take into account the size of the bed-twin, double, queen, or king size, and then cut the plastic to fit the size of the mattress.

,
After covering the box spring with the plastic, place one of the fitted mattress pads over the plastic then cover it with the fitted top sheet.
Besides using the plastic for a bed wetting sheet the plastic sheeting can be used for numerous household tasks such as drop cloths for painting, covering outside materials such as firewood and mulch, for remodeling projects,yard work, as well as many other jobs.

,
Periodically check the plastic to notice any wear and tear.
Put the plastic over the bed for a while and see how the person feels about it.
As mentioned above, another option for a homemade waterproof sheet to cover the bed is to use vinyl sheeting sold at craft stores such as Jo Anne Fabrics.
Although the bed is covered in plastic, it's still a good idea to have the incontinent person sleep in diapers whether pin-on diapers covered with plastic pants, disposable diapers with tape tabs (known as disposable briefs), or you can use both types of diapers but have the person wear pin-on diapers and plastic pants on some nights and the disposable diapers on other nights.

Wait for the sheet to begin to open.
Keep at it.
Crawl through Ballora Gallery, housing the animatronic Ballora, to reach the Breaker Room.
Move slowly.
Arrive in the Breaker Room, which houses the animatronic Funtime Freddy, and his hand-puppet, Bon-Bon.

Once this task is done, return through Ballora Gallery, in no danger, and complete the night.

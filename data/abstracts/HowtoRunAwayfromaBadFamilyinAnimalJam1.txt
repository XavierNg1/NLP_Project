Report abuse immediately.
Study where you are.
Wait until your abusive parents are out of the house you live in.
Once you're out of view or well hidden, now is the time to de-friend your abusive parents.
Once you're all gone from the house, stay at a friend's house.
Go to the pillow room again, but do not include you came from an abusive family.
Once you've found the people you like, ask them to adopt you, but take you home quickly.
Enjoy your new life with a new family.

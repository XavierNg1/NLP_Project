Get comfortable.
Use a pencil to draw.
Don't use an eraser at first.
Look carefully at the scene or object you want to draw.
Remember the general rule: objects higher up on the plane (closer to the sky) are generally smaller and farther away than objects lower, which are closer to you.
You'll notice some artists stick their pencil out in the air between their eye and their subject - this is to measure objects.

,
Hold your arm out straight with pencil in hand.
Sketch the entire scene lightly, keeping the above rules in mind.
Don't worry if everything doesn't look right the first time.
Don't start drawing a tiny portion of your scene and work on that part for a long time.
Once you are happy with the general scene you sketched even though it is not perfect, fill in slightly darker lines.
Sketch general shapes; a person's head is an oval, a rock that is resting on the ground should have a flattened bottom, an animal can be drawn with a series of ovals, circles, and hot-dog shapes.
If you are drawing geometric shapes like buildings or mechanical objects, you will want a ruler and some templates.
Shade what is not completely drenched in light: use soft line, or crisscrosses, or whatever way you feel comfortable making darker areas.
Color should be used sparingly with pencil drawings, because the lead is sensitive and will smear easily across the page.

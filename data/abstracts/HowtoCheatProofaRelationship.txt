Make your relationship (and each other) a priority.
Always tell the truth.
Have some time away from each other and some space (physically & emotionally...etc).
Communicate with and support one another as much as you can.
Work on your relationship every single day, work out the problems when they arise (effectively), whatever you can do to make your relationship more healthy, close, intimate, or make it better between you two, DO IT.

Never overlook the power of negotiation.
Don't abuse each other in any way shape or form.
Instigate a talk about cheating, don't be accusatory, defensive, etc.

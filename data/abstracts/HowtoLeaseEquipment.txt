Conserve working capital.Instead of investing a large amount of capital in a cash down-payment, leasing will require you to make low monthly payments.
Gain immediate access to up-to-date tools.Instead of purchasing a piece of equipment that may soon be replaced by a newer, better version, leasing gives you the flexibility to upgrade your equipment when your lease term ends and begin leasing a new and improved product.When you lease a piece of equipment, you avoid the risk of the equipment becoming obsolete.
Prepare to pay more over the long term.Unfortunately, while leasing does not require you to pay a lump sum (such as a down payment), you will end up paying more over the long term.

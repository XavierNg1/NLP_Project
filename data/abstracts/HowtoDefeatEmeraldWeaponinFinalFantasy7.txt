Max out your characters.
Max out all the materia listed above.
Prepare for the actual fight.
Start the fight by casting Wall and Regen on everyone.
The key to doing massive damage is limit breaks and mime.
Mime also duplicates items at no cost.
Ensure the party member with Final Attack > Phoenix equipped has sufficient MP.
If Cloud dies but other party members remain, use their limits and Mime them in the same manner.
Understand that winning is not always a guarantee.
Don't bother with conventional attacks.If you do not have a Limit attack charged and ready, try to heal the HP/MP of party members rather than perform an essentially ineffective attack.

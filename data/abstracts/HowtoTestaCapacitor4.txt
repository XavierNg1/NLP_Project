Disconnect the capacitor from its circuit.
Check the capacitor’s voltage rating.
Charge the capacitor with a known voltage less than, but close to, its rated voltage.
Set your voltmeter to read DC voltage (if it’s capable of reading both AC and DC).

,
Connect the voltmeter leads to the capacitor.
Note the initial voltage reading.

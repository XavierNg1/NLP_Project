Always start by drinking a lukewarm glass of water, but do not drink alcoholic beverages, acidic drinks(lemon tea or sodas) or even milk before or after doing scream vocals.
Begin by breathing in and out slowly and gradually take longer, heavier breathes.
Inhale deeply and try to achieve a "raspy" sound (result should sound like you're having an asthma attack).
(Inhaled Gutturals) Perform the inhale exercise from Step 3 quietly until it becomes a natural and comfortable action.
(Exhaled Gutturals) When you can exhale easily and comfortably, exhale harshly and open your mouth to form an "O" shape.
When you can easily pronounce a variety of words in the exhaled/inhaled voice, open your mouth slightly wider and force your voice a little harder.
Practice the previous step until breaking into your low voice becomes natural and comfortable.
Continue the previous steps until you feel comfortable performing the vocals and saying words in the distorted voice.

Once you have recorded your single it is time to pre-produce your video.
Take the vision and begin to break it down into a list of shots you must have in your video, like the lead guitar solo or the band walking across a bridge.
Using your shot sheets, plan a shoot schedule for every location.
When you are at a location, look at the scene through the camcorder.
Once the location is lit & dressed (props in place, extras ready, etc.),
After reviewing the Master shot on a TV to insure it looks good, you can start getting the closeups on the list.
This is a good time to shoot a bunch of artsy video.
The key to getting a professional look is to shoot as much video as you can at each location.
If you are unfamiliar with Non-Linear Editing applications (or NLEs,) you may want to draft a friend with their own NLE.
Once all the video has been captured into the computer and loaded into the NLE, post-production begins with putting the digital recording of the music on the first audio track.
The secret to creating a compelling video is twofold, work in layers and keep each shot short (less than 6 or 8 seconds is typical for music videos.),
The second layer is all the solo closeups, synched with the music by visually matching the audio tracks.
The third layer contains the synched throw-away cut-aways.
The final layer contains unsynced or wild shots.
This structure makes it easy to adjust individual shots and try out different ideas.
Render the final project in the highest quality possible.

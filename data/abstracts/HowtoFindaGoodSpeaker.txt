Throw the net as wide as possible when searching for a speaker.
Choose a speaker based on their overall fit.
Good writing does not necessarily a good speaker make.
Be holistic in your search for a speaker (don't base your search on price alone).
If you are a not-for-profit charity trying to raise funds see if the speaker will work with you on price (some will and some will not), but don't try to negotiate price based upon your charitable mission with the speaker and then have an expensive dinner at an expensive venue!

Don't get caught up in the name.

Decide where you want your myth to be set.
Start to create your characters.
Understand the conventions of myths in the culture you are created; most are passed down orally 'by speech' and this means they have features of speech, such as repetition 'Fee, Fi, Fo Fum...' or the rule of three; 'three fairies' or 'three boxes'.
Come up with appropriate names.
Don't make it overly complicated, at least initially.
End your story with a solution to the question or problem, such as 'And that is how The God (BLANK) Created Rain.'

Find a large area to sort clothes.
Gather all the laundry into this area.
Prioritize sorting into piles.
De-prioritize the following into piles: Clothes that don't fit, off-season clothes, clothes that need repair, clothes you wear only when nothing else is handy.
Place all these piles into manageable bags that each contain only enough clothes to fill a washing machine.

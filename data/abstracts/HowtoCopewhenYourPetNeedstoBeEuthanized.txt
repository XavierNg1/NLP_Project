Consult with your veterinarian.
Be with your pet and treat it well.
Make sure you have another driver with you, if you are licensed.
Take your pet to the vet a few minutes early, so you're not rushing into the consultation.
While at the vet clinic, ensure any paperwork is filled out prior to the consultation, unless required afterward, as after the euthanasia your eyes will more than likely be swelling, and you will be unable to concentrate.

During the process, take a few minutes to be with your pet, stroke it and talk to it.
After the euthanasia is completed, you may take your pet's body home for a burial, have it cremated and receive the ashes, or allow the vet to dispose of it (usually by cremation).
At this point, it is probably best to read How to Cope After the Death of a Pet and How to Cope With Losing a Pet.
Conduct a Burial Service ( This Link May Help ); have your friends and family there or simply have yourself.
Coping is hard; not coping is harder.

Understand that if your pet had a serious illness it was a better choice to have it euthanized than to have your pet suffer for the last of their life.

Search for (or take) pictures of cats.
Think of a caption.
Try finding cats in positions that look as if they have an 'invisible object'.
Open up the desired cat picture with Adobe Photoshop or GIMP, place your desired "capshun" on the picture in Impact font, Bold it, colour the text white and enable a black outline around it.

You're done!

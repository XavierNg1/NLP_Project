Use a graph and two points to find slope without the equation handy.
Find two points, putting them in simple (x,y) form.
Label your points x1, y1, x2, y2, keeping each point with it's pair.
Plug your points into the "Point-Slope Formula" to get your slope.
Understand how the Point-Slope Formula works.
Recognize other ways you may be tested to find slope.

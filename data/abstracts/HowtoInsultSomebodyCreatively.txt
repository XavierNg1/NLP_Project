Think before reacting.
Think up insults in your free time.
If you don't take their insults seriously, they won't be able to insult you seriously.

,
Don't react.
Don't swear or resort to "Your mom!",
If you have a point of pride, and they tried to hit it, realize that it is because of their insecurities.
Find their points of pride and insult them on it.
If you do catch a flaw in their argument, point it out and mock them for it.
If you stop them from insulting you, they will get frustrated and try harder.
If they are frustrated, you have essentially won.

Choose a firm, high or medium starch potato.
Scrub the potatoes with cool water and a vegetable brush.
Cut the potato in half lengthwise, then cut those halves into thirds.
Put sliced potatoes, salt, pepper, and oil in a large bowl and toss with your hands.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
Spread the potato wedges evenly over a baking sheet lined with foil or parchment.
Roast for 25-30 minutes, turning potatoes to the other side after 15 minutes.Use oven mitts to remove the pan and flip the potatoes with a spatula.
Remove the potatoes when they are golden and crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.You can pierce a wedge with a fork to see if it's done--the inside should be soft and offer no resistance to the fork.

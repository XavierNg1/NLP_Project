Prevent boredom.
Try a cribbing collar.
Use an anti-cribbing feed supplement.
Try making it impossible for your horse to crib by tying stiff brushes (brush side up) on your horse's usual cribbing areas.
As feeding forage ad lib is not always possible, try putting their hay into a hay net with really small holes to keep them chewing for longer.
Another option is putting a muzzle on the horse while in the stall (except at meal times), which will make it virtually impossible for the horse to grab objects to crib on.

If your horse is at the end stall in the aisle, trying moving him/her to a busier spot in the stable to prevent boredom.

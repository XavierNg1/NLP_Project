Understand that when you dance lyrical, your movements show the words of the song.
Try to come up with lots of different feelings and moves.
Find a stage, an open place, such as a basement, or even outside in your front lawn (if you do do this, make sure there is an outlet so you can plug in a CD player).
Pick a song with deep meaning and flowing music, otherwise it gets a little harder to stay fluent with your movements.

Listen to the song.
Do your body a favor; before you dance, make sure you stretch.
Just let your body flow.

Pay homage to your favorite beer by making the beer label the whole point of the decoration.
Cut out a large felt fabric circle.
Carefully either cut out the label off your beer can or peel off the sticker from a beer bottle.
Stick the label to the center of the felt.
Gather a dozen to a dozen and a half beer can tabs.
Thread a piece of ribbon or string through the upward tab.
Hang the ornaments when fully dried.

Think of your main idea or point in the couplet.
Think of the keywords surrounding your topic and end the first line with one of them.The last word in a line of poetry is always emphasized, and this is twice as true when the lines rhyme.
Brainstorm several words that rhyme with the end of your first line.
Place punctuation at the end of the line for complete thoughts, or leave it as an "open couplet.",
Make sure that both lines have roughly the same amount of syllables.
Follow your imagination and intuition to keep crafting couplets.

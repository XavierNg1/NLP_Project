Do your pre-landing check with your checklist: Brakes checked, undercarriage down & locked, Mixture fully rich, Fuel selector on both, Flaps as required, (Propeller pitch fixed), Suction indicating, Oil Temps.
Apply Carb.
Reach the 45 and contact the tower and tell them how many miles you are out on the 45 and your altitude.
Remember that when you reach 1⁄4 mile (0.4 km) from the runway, turn downwind.
Know that when you are abeam the downwind runway numbers, turn on your carburetor heat on, power back to 1500 rpm.
When the threshold of the runway is 45° behind you, turn left base, and apply another 10 degrees of flaps.

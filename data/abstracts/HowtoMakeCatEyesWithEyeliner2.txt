Put on some eyeshadow.
Take a short piece of clear tape, and tap it onto your hand.
Position the tape along the outer corner of your eye.
Apply your eyeliner, but make the line thicken as it goes towards the outer corner of your eye.
Extend the line past the corner of your eye, using the tape as a guideline.
Carefully peel the tape off and make any touchups, if necessary.
Finish off with mascara or false lashes.

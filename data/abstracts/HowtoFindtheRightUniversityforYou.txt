First of all, you want to consider whether or not University is the right path for you.
Next, take some time to consider which course or subject you would like to study.
Now you want to think about WHICH university is best for you.
Right, you have a list of Unis.
Have a look at the University itself on the website.
When you have narrowed your list down, write down the ones you have chosen.
Order prospectuses and book open days for your chosen schools.
Once you've visited the Universities you should have a feel for which one/s you like the most.

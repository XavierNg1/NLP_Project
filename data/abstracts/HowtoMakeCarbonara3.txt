Order or procure raw pig cheeks from a local butcher.
Cut away any visible fat or glands, leaving a clean, flat slab of meat.
Create your curing mixture using No.1 or No.
Rinse and dry the pig cheeks, the rub completely with spice mixture.
Zip the cheeks in a plastic bag and refrigerate for three days, flipping occasionally.
After three days, rinse the cheeks off and pat them dry.
Hang the cheeks in a dry place for two weeks.
Alternatively, roast the cheeks for 3 hours at 275F to speed up the process.

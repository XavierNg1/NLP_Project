Remember that people join together because of a common interest.
Take some time to read what people are discussing.
Make a Facebook Page about your common interest.
Post your comments knowing they can help others.

,
Make friends – that’s what social media is all about.
Take some time to visit other people’s Facebook profile pages.

,
Leave a comment or two on subjects that spark your interest, not just a meaningless comment , hoping to syphon people from other profiles.
Don’t restrict yourself to internet marketing alone.
Don’t just dabble with Facebook!

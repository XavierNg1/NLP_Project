First whisk out a pen and paper and figure out what you want to do series-wise.
When you are satisfied with your story arc, make up a first episode.
Do episodes 2/3-6 in this order: 2/3= future, 3/4= past, 4+5/5= present.
Really spice it up now!,
8 should have the return of something.
9 and/or 10 should be new.
11 should be really scary.
Think about final episodes.
Write the script and give them all names.

Turn on calming music.
Find a comfortable position on your bed.
Close your eyes.

,
Now imagine that you're on a beautiful bed, the sheets are all white, and the bed is on a beach.
Walk against the shore and feel at peace.
When you are done walking, suddenly rest at any spot on the shore.
Wait a while, and then decide that you are going to move through the water the same way you were walking.
You then collapse into the water.
You wait there. ,
You get up and move toward the shore.

,
Keep walking in the same direction you were going, and notice that there is a hill with a stream on it, going upward.
You will then see the bed that you once were in before, lay down on the bed very slowly.

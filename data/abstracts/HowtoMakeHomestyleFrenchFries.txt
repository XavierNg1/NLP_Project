Do your preparations.
Slice the potatoes.
Fill the skillet with oil, about half or even 3/4 near the top.
Dip the fries in milk, warm water, or egg whites before coating with flour.
Turn the heat up to medium and allow the oil to get very hot, so that the fries sizzle upon being dropped in.
Add in the fries, but make sure that you don't add so many that they touch one another.
Serve the fries hot, for best results and taste.

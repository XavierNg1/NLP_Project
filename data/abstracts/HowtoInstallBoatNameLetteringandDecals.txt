Note that there are a number of methods used to apply vinyl boat lettering to the transom of your boat.
Go online and search for wet release boat name decals.
Look for a wet release system, you can nearly guarantee a perfect job every time.
Clean your boat transom or the sides of your boat that will receive the decals.

,
Mix a solution of 1 cup of water and about 6-8 drops of Palmolive dish washing detergent.
Hold your decal into position and play with it with the backing still on until you get it in the exact position you want.
Spray the boat with a good heavy coating of your solution mix.
Place the decal in position.
Starting in the center, gently squeegee out the solution first working to the right, then to the left.
Notice that the application masking that holds your boat name letters in place will begin to turn milky and break down with the solution (the letters themselves are not water soluble, they bond firmer as they dry while the pre-masking breaks down) This process can take a few minutes to an hour or more.
Wait.

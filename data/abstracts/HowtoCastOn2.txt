Make a slipknot and slide it onto your knitting needle.
Hold the needle in your hand and wrap the yarn around your thumb from behind the working yarn.
Bring the needle in front of your thumb and the strand of yarn.
Slip the needle under the yarn around your thumb.
Pull your thumb out and tug on both strands of yarn.
Push the loop down towards the slipknot, and adjust if necessary.
Keep repeating the steps until you have the number of stitches the pattern requires.

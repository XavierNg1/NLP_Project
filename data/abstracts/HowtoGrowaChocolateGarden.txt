Plan your garden well in advance of the first warm day of summer.
Sow the seeds six to eight weeks before the last expected frost date in your region.
As the seedlings grow tall, thin the crop by removing most of the sprouts, leaving one strong plant.
When the early spring days become warmer, set the young plants outside to "harden off".
Prepare the soil about two weeks before you install the seedlings.
You can design your garden by setting the plants above ground according to the width and height requirements of each cultivar.
If the design appears satisfactory, remove the plants from their pots and insert them into the soil.

Sort through your fabric stash.
Prepare the fabric.
Cut the fabric into strips.
Find the end of the twine.
Select a fabric strip.
Tie the fabric strip to the twine on the side of the knot (described above) that is away from the end.
Slide the tied fabric gently against the knot in the twine.
Continue to tie strips down the length of the twine.
When you're satisfied with the length, simply tie a knot in the twine at the end of your fabric strips.

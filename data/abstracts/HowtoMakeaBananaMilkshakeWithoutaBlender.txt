Peel the banana.
Add ice cream and continue to beat until smooth and the mix is well blended.
Add milk and using a hand whisk, whisk until creamy and frothy (about 2 minutes).
Alternatively, use a cocktail shaker if you have one, by transferring the banana ice cream and milk into that and shaking away.
Taste to ensure it's sweet enough, add a little sweetener if needed, or a little more milk if the ice cream was too sweet.
Serve at once.

The books you can create with Apple’s iPhoto program are varied.
Begin with an 8”x6” blank Photoshop page and fill it with the endless options available in the program; screened images, special fonts, filtered effects.
When the page is complete, save it as a psd in case you need to come back to it later with changes.
Drag the .jpg into an iPhoto album.
Choose the book’s “Crayon” theme.
In minutes you can complete your book because the work has already been done.
You have the choice of different size books: hard or soft covers, and spiral or self bound.

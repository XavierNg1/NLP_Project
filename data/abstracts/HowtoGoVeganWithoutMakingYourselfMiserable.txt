Think about why you want to be vegan.
Start slowly.
Replace!,
If you get discouraged, remember how badly animals are treated, how poverty is exacerbated by high level meat production and how the environment can benefit from less meat eating.
If you cheat, realize that it's not the end of the world!,
Meet other vegans.
Congratulate yourself.
Try new foods.

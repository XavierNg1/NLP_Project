Purchase at least one dozen crocus bulbs from a supplier by September.
Plan to plant the bulbs, or “corms,” in September or October in the Northern US or October to November in the Southern US.

,
Calculate six to eight weeks before the first hard frost.
Pick a sunny spot for planting.
Dig the soil to a depth of 12 to 15 inches.
Work 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of compost into the dirt.
Dig your hole about 3 inches (7.5 cm) deep.
Sprinkle some bone meal into the hole before you plant.
Turn the corm so that the pointed end is facing up.
Water the bulbs thoroughly after you plant them.
Cover the area with 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of mulch to retain water and keep the crocuses safe from severe weather.
Don’t overwater the crocuses.
Don’t mow the grass where crocuses are naturalized until the foliage starts to die.
Repeat the mulching and watering every fall.

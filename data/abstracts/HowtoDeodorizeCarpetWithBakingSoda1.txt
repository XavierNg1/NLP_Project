Vacuum your carpet first.
Once your carpet is as clean as possible, tell your family you'll be cleaning the carpet and ask them not to walk on it while you give it the baking soda treatment.








,
If the carpet is in an area with a lot of foot traffic, you may need to treat it one section at a time.








,
Liberally sprinkle baking soda over the area you want to treat.
Since baking soda tends to get clumpy, it might be useful to transfer it to a large shaker before applying.
Use fresh baking soda, rather than soda that's been sitting open in your refrigerator.
Scrub it into the carpet.
If you're worried about ruining the texture of your carpet, use an old sock or t-shirt to rub it into your carpet, rather than scrubbing.








,
At this point, it's best not to walk on the carpet until the job is complete.








,
Let the baking soda sit for several hours or overnight.
During this time, try to stay off the carpet, so baking soda doesn't get tracked through the house.








,
If you see a spot where the baking soda isn't covering the carpet, fill it in.
Vacuum up the baking soda.

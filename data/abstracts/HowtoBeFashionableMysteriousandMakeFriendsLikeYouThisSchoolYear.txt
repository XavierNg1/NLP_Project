A good start would be to analyze your wardrobe.
If you're reading this article, then you probably have Internet access, visit http://www.teenvogue.com/, the ultimate magazine and website for stylish teens.
If you don't have Internet access, go to Walmart, Target, a drugstore, etc.
Shop!,
Search for things that scream "you".
Instead of a traditional backpack, try a shoulder bag with a long strap, or one of those alternatives to plastic bags, which can be found at H&M, Forever 21, Target, etc.
For cute everyday makeup, try Almay eyeshadow, the ones that can play up your eye color.
Now that your clothes are ready, time for the act that isn't actually an act.
Reunite with your old friends, but don't be afraid to meet new people.
Keep your life secret.

Keep your horse well-groomed at home.
Remember the key to a healthy, shiny coat is through a well-balanced diet.
The day before the show, give your horse a bath with warm or tepid water, or regular temperature water if it's above 65 degrees outside.

,
Scrub a moisturizing shampoo deep into the coat with a rubber currycomb, lifting out the scurf (dead skin) and dirt.
Wash out the feet, between the legs, and any ‘hidden’ body parts that may not usually get washed.

,
Wash any white markings with a brightening shampoo, and get every stain out.

,
Gently shampoo the mane and tail with a shampoo meant for that purpose.
Finger through the tail and apply a generous amount of conditioner.
Apply a conditioner to the body hair, but not to the saddle area if you are riding.
Rinse out the mane and tail.

,
Apply a leave-in detangler to the tail (and mane, only if you are leaving it natural).

,
Apply a good dose of hair polish to every part of the coat (except the saddle area).
When your horse’s tail is just dry trim it to the correct length for your discipline.
Cut the bottom straight across at the appropriate length: just above the fetlocks for dressage, and mid-cannon height for jumpers and hunters.
Clip the long, straggly hairs on the sides of the dock to form smoother lines when the tail is raised.
Trim the mane to the correct length for banding or braiding.
With a pair of sharp, well-oiled clippers, clip your horse’s muzzle, bridle path, eye area and ears as close as you can.
When your horse has dried, cover him with a sheet to protect your work, and paint his hooves with a conditioner.
When you arrive at the show band or braid your horse’s mane.
For banding, take a small section of hair, about half to three-quarters of an inch wide, and wrap a band tightly around it, close to the crest.
If you are braiding, take a small section of hair, about an inch wide, and hold the rest of the mane back with a big hair clip.
If you are showing in saddle seat or park classes, braid a thin, colored ribbon into your horse’s forelock, and another one into the first lock of hair.
After doing the mane, braid the tail if you are showing in hunter or jumper classes.
Brush out the tail, and apply a spray detangler if you did not braid.
To add a thick appearance to the tail, hold it out and lightly spray it with a coloring spray (like Shapely’s Show Touch-Up).
Spray a shining spray (like Absorbine Show Sheen or Ultra’s Finishing Spray) onto the tail once the color spray dries to add a show-ring shine.

,
Go over your horse’s face, muzzle, ears, bridle path and legs again, to get all the stubble that may have grown during the night.

,
Wipe off the face with a damp cloth.

,
Brush the horse with a soft body brush to lift off all the fine dirt.
Touch-up any white markings with a color spray, chalk or cornstarch.
Wipe off the hooves and sand the surface smooth with sandpaper.
Wipe off any hoof dust and apply at least two coats of high-quality hoof polish (Absorbine’s Super Shine, Ultra’s Hoof Polish, etc.).
Spray the hooves with a hoof polish enhancer (Ultra Hoof Polish Enhancer, or a shining hair spray) to add extra shine.

,
Slide a pair of pantyhose over your horse’s legs to protect them from dust.
Get all your tack on, and get yourself changed, and right before you go in the ring, you need to do a few more things.

,
Wipe off the coat with a slightly damp piece of chamois to collect all the dust.

,
Apply a generous amount of highlighter (Silverado Face Glo, World Champion Shine On, Ultra Highlighter, etc.),
Apply a thin coat of fly spray, and re-apply the shining spray.

,
Brush out the tail.

,
Touch up any white markings and the tail with another coat of color spray.

,
Dust off the hooves, and re-apply the enhancer.

,
Smooth down the bands or braids with a little mousse to control the frizzies.

,
Now enter the ring with confidence, for you own the best-groomed horse on the grounds!

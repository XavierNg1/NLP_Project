Practice aiming.
Use different guns.
Try shooting from behind cover quickly and accurately.
Try snap shooting.
Judge distance and power for grenades by throwing a rock that is about the same shape and weight to different distances or from different distances.
Finally, practice with friends, moving targets work better because you adapt to shooting a realistically moving target and can get practice for dodging as well, which may come in handy.

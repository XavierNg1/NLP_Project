First if you don't already have one, get a guitar.
Practice.
Know music.
If you don't know how to practice, get some good guitar books.
Improve your finger strength and speed.
Becoming a good guitarist takes years, you're not gonna wake up one day and be able to play an amazing riff.

,
When you're practicing, don't just play chords of songs you know.
Try new things.
You can also play guitar and sing at the same time,like Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, or James Hetfield, but most of the best guitarists these days don't really sing much.

,
If you feel that you are confident in your playing, play for family and friends.

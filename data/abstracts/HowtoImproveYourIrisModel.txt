Access the spreadsheet you used for the article Model Your Own Iris in Excel and re-name and re-save it under a new name, something like "Model Your Own Iris in Excel.2".Build the above image by following these steps.

Select the following series with red or yellow glow or red or yellow lines and change the red to blue: Series 93/94 at about 270 degrees, Series 51/52 at about 165 degrees, etc. but leave a few on the lower right and one nearly straight up.
Construct the Looker vlookup table.Cut (command x) the ShrinkExpand sections at cell range G16:H22 and paste to cell IP4.Select both the picture and the chart and drag them straight down about 25 rows.
Enter Modifier

Enter to cell F16, Modifier;
Insert Name Define Modifier to Row 16.

Select cell range E1:IL16 and copy it.
Do the Formula Replacements for the Secondary Iris Fibers:

Select cell range G27:IL33 and do the following EDIT REPLACES:

Replace DIFF with DIFFS, Replace All, OK;
Replace STARTPT with STARTPTS, Replace All,, OK;
Replace Pieces with Peeces, Replace All,, OK; and
Replace Degrees with Degrees2, Replace All,, OK.

Modify the Secondary Iris Fibers Start Points, x and y:

Input Modifier2 to cell F37.
Select the data area equivalent to G26:H34 for each lower series from #123 in row 22 to Series #242 (columns IK and IL)(charting range IK26:IL34), and copy it and double-click in the chart's inner plot area of the iris and do command v paste, then edit the series formula in the formula bar until it becomes like these first three:

=SERIES(,'Circle Data and Chart'!$G$26:$G$34,'Circle Data and Chart'!$H$26:$H$34,2)
=SERIES(,'Circle Data and Chart'!$I$26:$I$34,'Circle Data and Chart'!$J$26:$J$34,123)
=SERIES(,'Circle Data and Chart'!$K$26:$K$34,'Circle Data and Chart'!$L$26:$L$34,124) all the way up to the last one:
=SERIES(,'Circle Data and Chart'!$IK$26:$IK$34,'Circle Data and Chart'!$IL$26:$IL$34,241)
You'll note that the series number of the first one is 2 instead of 123 or 122 and that's because at one point I tried tucking it under via order arrangement the top or frontmost iris fiber layer -- so just ignore that, please.
Above is the image of my best final effort.
Here is the Final Best Image produced from that process:

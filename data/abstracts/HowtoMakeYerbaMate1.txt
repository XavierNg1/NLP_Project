Place your hand on the top of the half-filled gourd and turn it upside-down.
Turn the gourd almost completely on its side and give it several light shakes back and forth.

Pour hot water into the empty space as you did with the cool water.
Drink from the bombilla.
Clean the gourd (or whatever container you used) after you're done and leave it out to dry.

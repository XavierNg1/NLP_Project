Gather together the supplies you need.
Drape the bed sheet over the head of the person who is going to wear it.
Cut big holes for the eyes (not while the person is wearing it).
Outline the holes in black pen for a spooky effect.
Safety pin the sheet to your shirt, or other clothing.
Test it out, walking around safely.

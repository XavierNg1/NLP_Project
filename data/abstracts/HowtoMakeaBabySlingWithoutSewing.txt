Wash and dry the fabric before use.
Use scissors to trim the cut ends as evenly as possible.
Apply the bias tape to the selvage edges of the fabric.
Fold any fabric wider than 35 inches (88.9 cm) so that it does not exceed this width.
Thread the unfinished end of the fabric through both rings.
Hold the rings in 1 hand, and grab the tail end in the middle of its width.
Pull the tail end through one ring, like threading a belt.
Place your hands in the rosette formed by the fabric, and work the fabric around until it completely covers the rings.

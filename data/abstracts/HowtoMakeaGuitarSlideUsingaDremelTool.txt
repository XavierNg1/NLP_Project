Using your electrical tape, tape the bottle neck right above where you would like to cut it.
Put on your respirator mask and safety glasses/goggles.
Insert the 545 Diamond Wheel into your dremel.
Put your dremel at about 15,000 RPMs.
Slowly grind away at the neck, using the tape as a guide.
After about five to ten minutes of grinding, the neck should, quite literally, drop off.
To smooth the now cut edge, you can either: Use the face of the diamond wheel to grind away the edges until smooth, or attach a silicon carbide grinding accessory, and grind away the edges.

Run some water, and remove the tape from the slide.
If you would like to have a polished edge, insert a polishing disk, and use some polishing compound to give the glass a nice, finished look.

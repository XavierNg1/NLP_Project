Get your cat in your lap or on the floor in front of you.
Get the right brush.
Run the brush through your hair first.
Let the cat sniff it.
Start brushing its head.
Spend time talking, soothing and patting your cat before, during and after grooming so that your cat comes to associate grooming with pleasant memories.

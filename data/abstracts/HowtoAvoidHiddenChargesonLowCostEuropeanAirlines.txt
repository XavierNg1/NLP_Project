Look for that latest offer on a low cost airline website.
Travel light: Just bring hand luggage with you, it mainly costs extra to take a bag in the hold of an aircraft and can be expensive.
If you do only have hand luggage with you, check-in and print your boarding pass online at home.
Fly to airports more further away from major cities.
Don't bother buying priority boarding, speedy boarding etc...
If you're travelling as a group, it is often worth paying the extra and add allocated seating on your booking.
Bring your own snacks and drinks.

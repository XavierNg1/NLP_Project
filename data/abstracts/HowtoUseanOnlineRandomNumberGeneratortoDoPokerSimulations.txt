Learn and play Texas hold' em.Do a simulation with aces because many beginners play any ace.
This simulation is useful because hold' em is played high and not high/low, there are no wild cards, the ace is the highest card.
Initially use a deck of cards to do simulations.
Use a deck of cards to recognize ratios (odds) in later studies.
For the first simulation, do a statistical study of the distribution of aces in a game for 8 players.
Think of all possible outcomes of a simulation before starting.
List the outcomes in the order, that you think, the results will be from large to small.

After shuffling, dealing out, and recording the results of a couple hundred deals, stop.
Make a summary of the simulation results.
After spending hours doing simulations, think about the essence of what you are doing and how you could do it faster.

Start using an online random number integer generator to do this simulation.
Later, do this simulation for 6, 4, and 2 players.
After much thought and study on this method and randomness, improve your way of using data from the random number generator.Look beyond the name of a game, and use the games that comes with Windows like hearts to take statistics.

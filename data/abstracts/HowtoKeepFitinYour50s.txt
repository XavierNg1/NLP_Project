Do at least one exercise for each of the main muscle groups.
Aim to weight train two to three times per week.
If you are new to strength training, or returning after a long lay off, begin with one set of each exercise, and increase the number of sets only when you begin to feel comfortable.In general, I would recommended doing 8 to 12 repetitions per exercise

,
Progressively increase the amount of resistance you use.
Try not to rush your movement when performing the exercises.
Do a full range of exercises.
Maintain proper technique.

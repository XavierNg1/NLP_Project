Balance the water chemistry:


Approximately 3 - 7 days prior to closing the pool, adjust your water balance within the ranges below:
pH: 7.2 - 7.6

Alkalinity: 80 - 120 ppm


Calcium Hardness: 180 - 220 ppm;
,
Then, shock the pool with a Chlorine Shock or a Non-Chlorine Shock, at least 1lb per 10,000 gallons (38,000Â L) (follow package directions).
Remove skimmer baskets, wall fittings, cleaners, solar blankets, ladders from the pool.

,
Put these in a safe location during the winter.
Lower water level in pool.

,
Using the filter pump, or a submersible pump, lower the level 12" - 18" below the skimmer for mesh covers, and 3" - 6" below the tile for solid, floating covers.
Drain all pumping, filtering, heating and chlorinating equipment.

,
Every pump, filter, heater and chlorinator has drain plugs to allow water to drain out.Lubricate

,
Fall closing of the pool is a good time to lubricate the pump lid o-ring o-rings with Magic Lube.Clean pool

,
Skim pool, vacuum pool, brush pool.Winterize the plumbing to and from the pool

,
If you have an in ground pool, you should blow out the lines using a Mighty Vac to blow air from the skimmer, through the equipment, and back to the pool.
Add winterizing algacide and other floaters.

,
Remember not to add algacide and shock at the same time.
Cover the pool.

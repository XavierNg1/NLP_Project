Learn the vicious cycle of OCD.OCD occurs when an unpleasant thought (for example, a thought of spreading disease to your loved ones) happens to pop up in your mind, and an extreme interpretation of that thought follows (maybe having this thought says to you that you are an evil person who can harm others through carelessness).
Identify your triggers.Whatever brings on obsessions and compulsions (situations, objects, people, or other thoughts) are called "triggers" because they activate the cycle of OCD.
Write out a fear hierarchy.Once you have tracked your obsessions and compulsions for a week, rank all of the situations that you fear from least to most scary.
Face your fear.In order for exposure to work, it is important that you try to resist carrying out your compulsions during or after the exposure (to the extent possible).
Move exposure forward.Once you experience only a little anxiety when completing an exercise, you can move on to the next one.
Track your obsessive thoughts.In order to challenge some of the unhelpful interpretations you give to your obsessions, you have to know what they are first.

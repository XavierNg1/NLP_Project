The easiest way to measure humidity is to buy a Hygrometer.
The simplest way to test a Hygrometer for accuracy is the damp cloth test.
A more accurate way to measure hygrometer accuracy (or to help calibrate accuracy) is the "Salt Test.",
For advanced applications, you can use the salt test with other related elements, each of which has their own readings.

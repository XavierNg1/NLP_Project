Determine when to do your first pruning.
Trim the tree back by half.
Prune for fruiting wood the following winter.
Do most pruning during the winter.Once your fig tree reaches its third dormant season, or third winter, the vast majority of your pruning should take place during the late portion of the season since the tree is not actively growing during that time period.
Remove suckers growing on the base of the tree.
Cut away dead and diseased wood.
Remove branches that do not come from the fruiting wood.
Trim down the secondary branches.Secondary branches are the branches that grow off the main branches of fruiting wood.
Consider cutting back the main branches considerably.
Pinch out new growth during the summer.Allow five or six leaves to grow on new branches during the peak summer months.
Remove potentially harmful fruit in autumn.

Get out your Easter Basket.
Put some Easter grass in your basket!,
If you plan on getting jelly beans, put a large plastic egg in your basket.
Choose the room you are putting your basket in.
Put it on a ledge, table, or by the fireplace.
Make sure your room is clean and there is a clear path between your door and the basket.
Leave a note for the Easter Bunny.
And don't forget a snack!,
Go to sleep.
Wake up, but not too early!,
Enjoy your day and candy!,
Wait until next year!

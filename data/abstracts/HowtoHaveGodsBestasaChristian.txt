Do as Jesus said, including stop worrying, "don't fret".
Be sure that you believe, are born again and filled with His Holy Spirit (as your guide and comfort).
Stop caring what negative people say about you; so, that means you will not be carrying a burden of guilt, shame, disappointment or anger,... People will always have their opinions.
Forgive yourself, for anything and everything.
Seek God's best with God.
Make provision for God's best with others.
Pray: "Whenever you praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your transgressions.
Work hard as necessary, but don't do too much.
Don't expect eastern religious practices such as Yoga bring God's best.
Set your mind on things of Christ's Spirit, and honestly avoid materialism and its end result:



"For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh/world, but those who live according to the Spirit of Christ, on the things of the Spirit/'Life'.",
Do good to and give to God's children and especially to the poor.
Spread the Gospel, God's love, The Truth, Life, and Way, for your best life now and that more abundantly, as found in serving God and doing good for the least of God's children, in Jesus Christ.

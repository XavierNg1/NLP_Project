Use hot sand to fill the pipe and bend it without collapsing.
Heat your oven to 425 °F (281.3 °C).
Fill the pipe with sand so that it is a few inches past the bend.
Pour the sand into a oven-safe dish and put it in the oven.
Carefully pour the hot sand back into the PVC pipe.
Slowly bend the pipe into your desired shape.
Empty the sand out and let the pipe cool.

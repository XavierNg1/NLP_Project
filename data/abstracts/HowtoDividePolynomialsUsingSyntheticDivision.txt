Write down the problem.
Reverse the sign of the constant in the divisor.
Place this number outside the upside-down division symbol.
Write all of the coefficients of the dividend inside the division symbol.
Bring down the first coefficient.
Multiply the first coefficient by the divisor and place it under the second coefficient.
Add the second coefficient and the product and write the answer below the product.
Multiply this sum by the divisor and place the result under the third coefficient.
Add the product and the third coefficient and write the result under the product.
Multiply this number by the divisor, write it under the last coefficient, and add it to the coefficient.
Place each of the new coefficients next to a variable of one less power than their original corresponding variables.
Write the final answer.

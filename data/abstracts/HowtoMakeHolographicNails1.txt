Get some holographic nail powder.
Do your manicure as usual, starting with a basecoat and finishing with your favorite color.
Apply a layer of non-wipable gel top coat, and wait until it gets rubbery, but not tacky.
Gently tap on the powder, starting from the base of your nail, and working your way towards the top.
Use a soft brush to dust off the excess powder.
Apply one more layer of non-wipable top coat.
Cure your manicure under a UV light.

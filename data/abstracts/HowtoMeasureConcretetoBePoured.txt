Measure the Length (L).
Measure the Width (W).
Measure the Height (H).
Use a Construction Calculator.
If you're calculating for Cubic Feet or Cubic Yards of Concrete needed, you will need to convert your inch measurements to Engineers Scale.
For the L measurement of 12 feet 6 inches (15.2 cm), take the 6 inches (15.2 cm) and divide it by 12.
At 15 feet (4.6 m) and 0 inches (0.0 cm) the W does not need to be converted.

,
For the H measurement of 3 and 3/4 inches, we will first need to convert the fraction 3/4 of an inch to a decimal.
Multiply them altogether.
To calculate the Cubic Yards take the 58.25 cubic feet and divide it by 27.

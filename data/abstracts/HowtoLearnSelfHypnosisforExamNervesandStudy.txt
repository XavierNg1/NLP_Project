Breathe in and out through the nose.

Next.
Imagine now a special place.
Next, imagine standing in front of a blackboard once more.
Now see yourself standing tall, breathing calmly.
To re-alert: Breathe deeply... then very slowly count yourself up from one (1) to three (3), suggest to yourself that you have enjoyed a wonderful relaxation and at the count of three (3) you will return into a natural level of awareness, feeling calm, re-energised and alert, looking forward to the remainder of your day.

First, buy a cheap prom dress, the bigger the better.
Next, you need to add things to the dress.
If you need to make sleeves: Find a pattern online for bell sleeves.
Sew on decorations to the dress.
Now your dress is ready.
Makeup should involve a pale face, pink cheeks, and red lips.
Now, make sure you wear comfortable shoes - you can even wear sneakers, since your dress will be long enough to cover them.

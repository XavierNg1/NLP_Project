Remember, even though you may have to deal with leaving friends you love and doing all the "lasts", you can still keep in touch with friends and there will be more firsts to live through, its not good to live in the past and get upset that you can't stay where you are in life.

,
Keep in touch with friends.
Try as many things as you can your senior year, that way, you have even more lasts and you can dabble, meet more people you've grown with but never really talked to and you may even find out you love something you've never tried.

,
Take lots of pictures and make a collage or put them on your wall or somewhere you can look at them whenever you're feeling the need.

,
Remember to enjoy the times you have and not take any of them for granted, each moment is a blessing and should be lived.

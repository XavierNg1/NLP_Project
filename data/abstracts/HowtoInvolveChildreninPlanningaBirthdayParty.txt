Let your child(ren) help plan the theme, location, guest list, menu, games, etc.
Decide on the time length of the party.
Decorate the location.
Provide name tags for the guests as they arrive.
Have a box or bag ready to put all the presents in as the children arrive so they can be kept safe to open later.
Keep the children busy.

Make sure you have good party food (see the 'Things You'll Need' section).

Have the party bags ready and named so they can be handed to each child as they leave.

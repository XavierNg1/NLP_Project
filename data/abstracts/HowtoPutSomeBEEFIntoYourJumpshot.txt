'B'-Balance: Keep your feet shoulder-width apart, with your shooting foot slightly ahead of your non-shooting foot.
'First E'-Eyes: Choose a target - it could be the front of the rim, the centre of the hoop, or the basket as a whole, and focus only on that.
'Second E'-Elbow: Cock your elbow back to a 90Â° angle and look at the back of your wrist.
'F'-Flick or Follow-through: Straighten your elbow and release the ball by flicking your wrist, which gives the ball some backspin.

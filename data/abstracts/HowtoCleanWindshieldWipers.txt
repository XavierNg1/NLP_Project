Take a general look at the windshield of your car.
Lay out all of the cleaning products that you intend to use in a location that is easy to reach from the windshield.
Lift one of the windshield wipers gently and decide what orientation is easiest to clean the blade.
Place the wiper in the preferred orientation.
Spray some cleaner liberally onto a paper towel.
While holding the wiper, wipe from one end to the other back and forth at least a couple of times.

Inspect the paper towel, it should have no discoloration.
Run a fingernail along the blade carefully to check for a consistent texture.
Operate the wipers while dispensing the carâ€™s own washer fluid and confirm that the wipers leave a streak-free path in both directions.

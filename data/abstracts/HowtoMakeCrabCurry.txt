How to dry roast the spices:Simply heat a heavy bottom non-stick pan and put the spice in it (without any oil).
Clean the crabs and put them in a saucepan with water (a little more than is required to cover them up).
Meanwhile, take 4 dry red chilies, break them and remove as many seeds as you can and discard the seeds (we need the chilies to give a good color to the gravy yet not making it too hot).
Dry roast the other ingredients.
In a pan heat the oil, add the fennel seeds and saut√© for 10 seconds and add this paste.
Bring it to a boil.
Serve the crab curry with plain boiled rice.

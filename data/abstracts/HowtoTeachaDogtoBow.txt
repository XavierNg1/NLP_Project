Make sure that your dog knows how to come, sit and lie down on command.
Have your dog stand facing you, about two feet (60 cm) away.
Holding the treat in your hand, wave the treat downward (or even drop it to the floor).
Repeat this for a few times to get him used to the movement and receiving a reward.
Add the verbal cue.
Repeat the trick a few times.
After several repetitions, try giving the "Bow" or "Stretch" command without moving your hand to signal.

Open a new Excel workbook and create 3 worksheets: C.Data, Chrys Chart and Saves.
Set Preferences: Open Preferences in the Excel menu.
Select the entire worksheet by selecting between the 1 of row 1 and the A of column A in the upper and left most corner of the C.Data worksheet.
Enter the Defined Name Variables and headers of row 1.
Enter the column headings.
Enter the formulas.
Into cell B3 enter w/o quotes the formula "=IF(ISERR(A3/(A3-1)),0,A3/(A3-1))" and do Insert New Comment and edit in "B3: The formula in this cell, "=A3/(A3-1)" is a Neutral Operation in that when Y= X/(X-1), then X + Y = X * Y, as does this cell =A3/(A3-1), similarly.
 Edit Go To cell range C3:C363 and with C3 the active cell, enter the formula w/o quotes "=(SIN(CFactor*A3/(2*B3)*Converter)*COS(A3*CFactor*Converter))+COS((ROW()-3)*PI()/180)" and Edit Fill Down and Errors are on purpose and Do Insert New Comment and edit in "C3: This formula, =(SIN(CFactor*A3/(2*B3)*Converter)*COS(A3*CFactor*Converter)) +COS((ROW()-3)*PI()/180) looks a lot more wicked than it really is.
 Edit Go To cell range D3:D363 and with D3 the active cell, enter the formula w/o quotes "=(SIN(CFactor*A3/(2*B3)*Converter)*SIN(A3*CFactor*Converter))+SIN((ROW()-3)*PI()/180)" and Edit Fill Down and the errors are on purpose and do Insert New Comment and edit in "D3: This formula works pretty much like the one in D3, except that it's using 3 SIN() functions together instead of SIN*COS+COS of cell C3.
That is all that's needed to produce the chart shown above, There are two more columns, however, for adventurous types.
Edit Go To cell range F3:F3633 and with F3 the active cell, enter w/o quotes the formula "=COS(D3)" and Edit Fill Down.
 Create the Chart.

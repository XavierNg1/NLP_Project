Act spontaneously.
Avoid stereotyping your travel experiences.
Think about the destinations often forgotten, the ones outside the main tourist track.
Talk with the locals as much as possible.
If it's free, it's probably good and something the locals would be doing.
Get on a bus, a train, a local bicycle hire.
Try to learn the language basics.
Visit other parts of the country that are not really detailed in the guidebooks.
Stop the 5 star hotel trawl.
Be prepared to feel the historical, social and cultural life instead of emphasizing you've been somewhere by showing the pictures of all the famous places to your friends.

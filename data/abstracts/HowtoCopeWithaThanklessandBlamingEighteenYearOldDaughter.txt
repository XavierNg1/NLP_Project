Talk to your daughter.
Ask her if there is anything she wants to talk about, reassure her by telling her you love her, and you'll always be there.
Ask her advice; talk to her about things that you are experiencing, and genuinely ask her perspective on the situation or how to do things differently, even if you think you know the answer.
She is eighteen, so chances are, that it's the normal stages of being teen-age.
Find an activity you can do together where she won't feel judged (look through wikiHow!).
More importantly, check on or mildly interact with her--daily, but also a few times throughout the day or whenever you are both home.
Don't treat her like some kind of non-human just because she's a teenager.

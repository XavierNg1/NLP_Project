Limit your phone time.
Limit the time you spend together.
Have your own life.
Keep it a bit mysterious.
Don't be too easy to reach.
Beware of trying to make her jealous.
Be the last thing she thinks about at night.
Make her wonder if you're thinking of her.
Leave a piece of yourself with her.
Charm her even when you're apart.
Write her a letter.
Treat her like a queen when you're together.

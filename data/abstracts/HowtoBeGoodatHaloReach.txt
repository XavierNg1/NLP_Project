Start practicing!,
Learn the places on each map.
Use the armor abilities often.
Challenge your friends on/offline to a match and see how you do.
Ask a friend/family to join you on campaign to make things easier.
If you have finished the game, try it again on Legendary.
Now that you have learned the basics, go online and challenge real people, or if you're more cooperative try Firefight.

Understand that a lot of people may say they have a lot of pedigree cats for sale, but hardly any are proper/hobby breeders, so scams are scarily common!,
Make sure the breed you want will fit in with your lifestyle, budget, home, and other pets/family.
Research breeders.
Contact them.
Wait for them to get in touch.

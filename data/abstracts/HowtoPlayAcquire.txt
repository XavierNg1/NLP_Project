Know what it is.
At the beginning of the game, each player receives $6000 in cash.
The player whose tile is in the topmost row (closest to row A) goes first.
Then, starting with the first player, each player draws six tiles.
Place tiles.
When a player founds a chain, he receives one free share of stock in that chain.Chains are deemed "safe" if they have 11 or more links; placing a tile that would cause such a chain to be acquired by a larger chain is also not permitted.
After a player places a tile, and the results of that placement have been handled, he may purchase up to three shares of stock.Finally, the player replaces the tile he played, ensuring that he has six tiles at the end of his turn.

Be on guard.
Send him a drink.
Be direct.
Lure him in using an extra ticket.
Make him ask you out.
Don't make him a priority.
Make him wait.
Set standards.
Back off a little.
Let him do his own thing.
Don't pressure him.
Ask to meet his friends.
Remind him what you're worth.
Don't talk about the relationship.
Have fun.

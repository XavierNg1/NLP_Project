Draw the circuit neatly.
At each junction, use Kirchhoff's First Law to equate the current flowing in to the current flowing out, i.e.
Find out how many independent loops exist in the circuit.
To check if you have the right number of loops, count the number of currents you have.
For each numbered loop, write the loop equation using Kirchhoff's Second Law.
Solve the system of N equations to get the N currents.

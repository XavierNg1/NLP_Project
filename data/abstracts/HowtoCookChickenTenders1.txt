Rinse off a boneless chicken breast and cut it into strips.
Take 1 cup flour, 1 cup breadcrumbs, and 2-3 beaten eggs and place each in a separate bowl.
Add any desired seasonings to the flour.
Dip the chicken in the flour, turning to coat lightly.
Take the floured chicken and dip it in the egg wash, draining off any excess liquid.
Press the wet chicken into the breadcrumbs to coat.
Cook the tenders by pan-frying, deep-frying, or baking.

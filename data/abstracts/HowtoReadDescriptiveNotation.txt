NOTE: This is not Algebraic Notation.
Learn the squares first.
In descriptive notation the pieces are represented the same way as algebraic except that columns are designated by their primary piece.
Each square is designated according to the color you have.
Count each square from the primary piece.
Captures are recognized by one piece capturing another piece, so if a queen captured a queen, it would be written as QxQ.
Castling is also designated differently.
Special terms: En passant,, Check,, Checkmate or Mate, Resign or Draw are designated as written, where in Algebraic these terms have abbreviations and symbols.

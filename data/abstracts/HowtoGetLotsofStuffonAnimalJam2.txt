There are also items that do not have the "rare" label on them, but Jammers consider them rare:

Rare Gloves used to have no rare label on them until it was released as a Rare Item Monday on April 2014,though it was released earlier on February 6, 2012 and accidentally released again on February 16, 2012
Colored gloves can be found in all sorts of colors: black, red, green, etc.

Distance yourself from your friend for a little while.
Consider the circumstances and remember why you unfriended this person in the first place.
Decide whether it is more comfortable to talk to your friend privately in person, on the phone, or over social media.
Ask to speak with your "friend" privately.
Raise the issue, but be polite and refrain from yelling, shouting, swearing or name calling.
Tell your "friend" that you unfriended the person, and give your reasons.

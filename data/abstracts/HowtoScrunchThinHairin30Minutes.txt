Take a shower at night and blow dry your hair until it is slightly damp.
Separate the hair in half and twist the two half's together.
Pull the wet, twisted hair into a bun.
In the morning, let your hair out from the bun.
Part your hair how you want it and clip bangs away if you want to straighten/curl them.
Start scrunching.
You can flip your hair for extra volume, if you wish.If you have bangs you pinned apart, straighten or curl them now and spray with hairspray to hold.
Shake your head a few times and ta-da!

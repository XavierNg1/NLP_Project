If you like him/her, make sure you're nice to them.
Be friends with this person.
Get him wanting you.
Be approachable.
If he doesn't ask you to go see a movie, or go to the dance or whatever, ask him.
If nothing works for that date?,
If he says yes, tell him all the details, and when you're getting ready for this event, dress appropriately.
If he thinks that these are just two friends hanging out, try to show him, it's not.
TRY TO NOT RUN OUT OF THINGS TO SAY.
After around 3 or so get togethers, when you get to know him, he gets to know you, it's time to show your feelings.
If he says I like you back, then yay!,
If he says he likes someone else, move on.Say "Oh okay" and check your watch or phone.

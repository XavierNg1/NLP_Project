Think, is there a reason you should not tell your parents?,
Make a plan B, in case they kick you out of the house.
Talk to your girlfriend about what might happen.
See if your parents are even okay with you dating.
Consider tackling each parent separately.
Tell them that you really like this girl, and that's not anyone's fault.
Give them time.
Break it to them slowly.
Accept yourself, no matter what happens.

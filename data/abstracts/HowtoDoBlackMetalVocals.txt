Listen to black metal and understand what it's about.
Decide what kind of scream you want to do.
Learn about the different types of voices you can sing in.
Add a raspy like sound to your voice by gurgling slightly at the back of the throat once you can sing comfortably at a "shout" pitch, and push with the diaphragm (try tensing your abdominal muscles).
Start trying to increase the strength of your "gurgling" technique (slowly - don't push yourself too hard, or you'll ruin your voice), increase your range (once again, slowly, for the same reasons), etc.

,
Try singing while applying the same technique you learnt in step 2 - the rasp effect, but without the diaphragmatic support, for a different style.

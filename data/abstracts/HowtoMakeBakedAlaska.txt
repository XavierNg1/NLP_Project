Line a 3-quart bowl with plastic wrap, letting excess hang over the sides.
Pack your favorite ice creams into the bowl in layers.
Cover the top of the bowl with plastic wrap and press down.
Freeze the ice cream bowl until frozen solid -- at least 3 hours.
Separate four eggs and discard the yolks.
Add 1/4tsp cream of tartar and the eggs to a large metal mixing bowl.
Beat the egg whites on medium with a hand mixer until peaks form.
Keeping the mixer running, slowly add a half cup of sugar and a pinch of vanilla to the mixture.
Mix the sugar and eggs until stiff peaks form, about 2 more minutes.
Preheat the oven to 500Â°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Cut your cake or brownie to fit the bottom of the bowl.
Remove the ice cream from the freezer and take off the bottom layer of plastic wrap.
Press your cake or brownie into the bottom of the bowl.
Turn the bowl upside down on the parchment paper.
Using a star-shaped pipette or another decorative icing method, cover the whole thing in meringue.
Bake the entire thing for 3-4 minutes, until the outsides are golden brown.

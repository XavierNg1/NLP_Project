Teach them the tenets of your faith early (as soon as the child can speak), and not just when they go to the places where these ideas are taught, but teach them at home, in the car, on the playground, and when something significant happens.
Be the primary teacher of all things spiritual.
Be positive when speaking about others (especially spiritual “authority” figures.
Leave space for difference.
Remind them often that the rituals that go with your belief are not mandatory.
Keep your spiritual beliefs as a part of your very being.
Demonstrate your faith in your own life.

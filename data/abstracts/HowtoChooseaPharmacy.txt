Availability: One of the most important factors to consider when choosing a pharmacy is availability.
Insurance:


Regular Prescription Insurance: You want to make sure that the pharmacy you choose accepts a lot of insurance plans, and most importantly, the insurance plan that you currently have.
No Insurance:


Shop Around: If you donâ€™t have any prescription drug insurance, then you want to shop around for best price.
HIPAA Compliance: The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (usually referred to as HIPAA) was passed by congress in 2003.
Over-The-Counter Products: It is handy when your pharmacy also carries over the counter (OTC) products such as Tylenol or Sudafed.
Friendly and Personal Service: Just like when choosing a grocery store, you want good customer service.
Large Inventory: The pharmacy that you choose should have a good sized inventory.

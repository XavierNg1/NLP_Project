Download the editing software GIMP.
Take out a blank piece of printer paper.
Scan the piece of paper you've used to write all your signatures into your computer.
Your image will probably be a bitmap file.
You may have to maximize the GIMP window, so do so if you have to.
Click and drag your mouse to create a rectangle around your signature.
This is the fun part!,
Click Save as, and save your new image as something other than the original scanned image.
Open your cover letter.

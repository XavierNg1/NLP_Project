Never get complacent around machinery or livestock, as complacency is also a killer of many farmers and members of farm families.
Always let someone know where you are, where you are going to be, and what time you expect to be back.
Do not overestimate your strength and speed when handling both machinery and livestock.
Always have an escape route.
Wear eye/ear/foot/respiratory protection when and where possible.
Be aware of your state of mind.
Use your common sense!

Ask the person to lie down for five minutes.He should be completely flat on a table, bed or couch.
Place your stethoscope over the brachial artery.With the blood pressure cuff wrapped around the person's arm, have her palm facing upwards and place the stethoscope on the inside of the elbow.
Inflate the armband with the pump.Generally you should inflate it to around 200 as your starting number, and gradually deflate it from there.
Record the diastolic reading after the sound clears.
Finish by taking the radial pulse reading.This is the pulse you find by placing your index and middle finger over the inside right wrist.
Ask the person to stand.
Pump up the arm band again.
Wait two minutes.
Take one last measurement of the patientâ€™s pulse (measure at the wrist).Write down your findings.
Evaluate the results.Subtract the standing (1 minute) values from the laying down readings.
Consider the person's symptoms.Regardless of the difference between the blood pressure values lying down and standing, if the person feels lightheaded and/or dizzy consistently upon standing he needs to be seen by a doctor for a professional evaluation of what may be causing these symptoms.
Understand why it is important to measure orthostatic blood pressure.

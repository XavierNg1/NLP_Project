First, decide on a location for your new world.
Now, name your world: this can be anything that you want.
Now, you need to think of how you would enter your fantasy world.
Now you've accessed your world: but it's blank!,
Add creatures!,
You can add bad people to make action.
Make weapons!,
Keep it a secret!

,
Choose your side - good or bad?

,
Are there other people in your land?,
Write down everything about your world!,
Visit your world.

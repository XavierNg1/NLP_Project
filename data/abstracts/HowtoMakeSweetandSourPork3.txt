Drain the pineapple, but reserve the juice.
Place the cubed pork in your slow cooker, along with the green bell pepper and sliced onion.
In a bowl, combine the brown sugar, cornstarch, pineapple juice (add water to make 3/4 cup if necessary), vinegar, water, soy sauce, and salt.
Prepare rice or another side to join with your pork.

Stand up for yourself.
Socialize with your brother-in-law and his wife.
If your new brother-in-law and his wife reject your offer to meet for dinner then just stop trying.
Make a decision on how to deal with it.
Discuss everything with your husband.
Do not allow this jealous person to interfere with the opportunity of you getting to know your in-laws.
If your brother-in-law's wife continues to be uncivilized then do not be afraid to approach her with a stern attitude.
Stand your ground.

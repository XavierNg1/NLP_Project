Now try your level on the burners.

Each burner has three supporting legs besides the connector.
Use the level to determine which leg is the highest.
Remove the burner and use a file or grinder to remove some metal.

Caution: Don't take off so much metal that you remove the tip that hooks into the burner pan.
Since you have now customized each burner to its spot, you don't want to mix them up.

Take a preventative approach to grassy weed control.
Maintain your yard so that it is up to date with all of the necessary treatments.
After regular ongoing yard maintenance, apply a pre-emergent weed control treatment to your lawn.
Identify which grassy weed is causing the issues in your yard.
If all the above fails and weeds have already started attacking your yard, use a grassy weed control application.
If you don't want to use chemicals but don't mind manual work, you can also tryÂ removing the weeds by pulling them out.
Apply additional (and regular) yard care and weed control treatments to prevent the grassy weeds from coming back.

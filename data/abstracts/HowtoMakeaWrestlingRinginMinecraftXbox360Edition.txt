Gather your materials.
Decide on the size.
Fill in the inside of your apron (outline of the ring) with the block you chose.
In each corner, place a 2 block high post with a coal block.
On the highest block of your ring post, put your wool from that side to the post next to it.
Go to each corner with your ladders and with the 2 pieces of wool that are connected to the pole, put ladders on them.
Decorate around it.

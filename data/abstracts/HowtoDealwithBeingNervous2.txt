Start strong.Be extra prepared with a clear, strong starting point in order to provide the boost to carry you forward for the remainder of the time.
Shift focus from self to content.People who are prone to nervousness typically think more about themselves than about whatever it is that theyâ€™re trying to do.Nervousness can double when you see the cause of the nerves (an interview, a test) as overly-reflective of you and your potential.
Watch yourself.
Take your time.Rushing through whatever is making you nervous will only be confusing to others, and display how nervous you are.
Keep the situation in perspective.Remember not to sweat the small stuff.

Purchase a good quality flatbed scanner.
Gather your photo collection.
Ensure that you have ample storage space on your computer.
Follow the setup instructions that come with your external hard drive for connecting it to you computer, then open the software program that came with your scanner.
Verify that your scanner is set to optimize photos, just remember that the greater DPI (Dots per inch) setting you use, the better quality you will have if you go to print later, however, conversely, the greater amount of storage will be required per scanned photo.
Once you scan your first set or group of photos, verify that they are in fact saving to the location you chose.
At this point the process becomes pretty monotonous, you simply go through, photo by photo, load them onto your scanner, scan them in accordingly, and verify that they are saving where you want them to save.
Once you are done with all your photos, you can choose to clone your hard drive, or make additional copies onto additional hard drives, CD's, or even DVD's and you can share those copies between family members, or others that you trust for safe keeping.

Understand that not all popular people in school go on to be successful adults.
Look around you at those popular people.
Compare them to your real friends, who might not be the most popular kids in school, but who wouldn't talk about you behind your back just to be more popular.
Remind yourself that being popular does not guarantee good grades, honest friendships, or people who would care about your well being, or your needs.

,
Realize that by being happy with yourself, your looks, your grades, your compassion and your sense of humor, makes you a better person and will help you make a better life for yourself in the future.

,
Improve your social skills for the right reasons.
Read Charles Bukowski.
Understand that being popular really has no importance.
Strive to enjoy friendships rather than be popular.
Also remember that if you're not the most popular kid, it's okay because maybe being popular isn't for you, maybe you have a specific reason to not get along with somebody.

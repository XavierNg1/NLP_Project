Determine whether you need to replace the door seal at all.
Consider repairing the gasket if it’s possible.
Research the right gasket to buy.
Prepare the new gasket while you’re removing the old one.
Remove the gasket from the refrigerator door.
Loosen, but do not remove, the screws that hold the metal retainer around the entire door.
Pull the gasket out of the door to remove it once you have loosened the retainer screws.
Take the new gasket, and install it.
Use the hex head driver to screw the metal retainer in.
Apply powder.
Rub some powder around the hinge side corners of the door seal and where the seal slides.
If this still doesn't prevent twisting, then wedge a screwdriver under the seal as you close the door, and leave it shut for an hour.

Close the refrigerator door, and open it several times to inspect the gasket.
Rub petroleum jelly along the hinged side of the door if you see some gaps.

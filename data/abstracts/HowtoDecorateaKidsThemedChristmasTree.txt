Acquire a Christmas tree.
Place the tree at the child's height at first.

,
Decorate the tree with lights and some popcorn or cranberry strands.
Have your children create a paper chain that can be hung on their tree.

,
Allow your children to collect things that can be used as ornaments that can be hung on their tree.
Attach these "ornaments" to the tree, with the help of the children.
Attach a few strands of gold or silvery garland to the tree if your children can be trusted to not eat anything they find laying on the floor.
Attach a tree topper to the top of the tree.
Move the tree to a better-suited area, or until the tree is away from the child's hands, but is still in pluggable reach of an electrical outlet.

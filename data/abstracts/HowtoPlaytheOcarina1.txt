Shop for your ocarina online.Since it’s such a rare instrument, you’re going to be hard-pressed to find one in a music store.
Decide on a pitch range.
Choose an ocarina style that best suits your skill level.A four-hole or six-hole ocarina will be the best style to learn on, as they are generally inexpensive, light, and easily produce a wide range of notes with very few finger patterns.
Avoid Peruvian and plastic ocarinas.

Preheat the sear burner on your gas grill using the high setting.
Place 1 or 2 steaks on your sear burner.
Sear the steaks for 1-1/2 minutes on the first side.
Place the steaks on your medium heat burner and close the lid so that they can continue to cook through.
Check for doneness using the palm test.
Let the steaks stand before eating.

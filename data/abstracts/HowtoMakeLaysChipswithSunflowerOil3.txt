Scrub your potato of excess dirt.
Peel the potato carefully.
Slice your potatoes as thinly as possible using your mandolin or a sharp knife.
Mix the potatoes, 1/4 cup oil, and generous heaping of salt in a large plastic bag.
Layer the potatoes on a piece of parchment paper so that none are touching.
Cook for 3-5 minutes, watching the entire time.
Remove once they chips just start to brown.
Cool and enjoy, cooking more batches as needed.

When using verbs that contain infinitives ending in -er, we remove the final letter "s" from the -tu form of the present tense for the imperative, unless it is followed by the pronouns -y or -en.
There are three verbs that are irregular in the imperative, taking their imperative from the present subjunctive form.
When you want to form the negative imperative form, simply put -ne in front of the imperative and -pas or an alternative after it.
When using object pronouns with the imperative, the pronouns follow the verb and are hyphenated.
However, with the negative imperative, the pronouns will precede verb, as in these examples:


Ne lui dites rien.
With reflexive verbs, the reflexive pronoun follows the imperative, and -te changes to -toi.
Just as we saw earlier with object pronouns, however, in the negative imperative of reflexive verbs, the reflexive pronoun precedes the verb, and -te is used, not -toi.

Have a go-bag ready for the day martial law is declared.If you think martial law is going to be enacted by any military force hostile to you then you should consider being ready.
Stash guns, ammo, supplies, and survival gear in a hidden bunker.This will be your family's rally point when martial law happens.
Know the rally point established by the local militia.
Group up with your militia as soon as humanly possible.
Establish a chain of command and follow orders.Until now a military chain of command may have been hypothetical or loosely enforced.
Stay with your militia as you move to a safe location.

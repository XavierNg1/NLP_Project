Contact your local large animal veterinarian to assess whether the reason your cow is down is really from nerve paralysis and not something more serious.
Once you have determined the cause that she is down from nerve paralysis, get her to stand up.
Once (and if) she's up, grab her tail to keep her from falling.
Try to keep her on her feet for a few minutes.
If she goes down again, let her rest for a few minutes before trying to get her up again.

,
Make sure she can stand and walk on her own before you leave her and her calf alone.
Keep an eye on her until you are certain that she's figured out how to manage by herself.
Make her comfortable.
Your vet may prescribe anti-inflammatory medications, Vitamin E, Selenium and steroids for her to assist nerve healing and reduce swelling.

,
Check on her often and keep trying to get her up.
Turn her over a couple times a day so she's not always laying on one side all the time.
Most cows will get up after a few hours or a few days, especially if you are persistent in helping them get up.
If she has been down for a while when you do find her, the outcome may not be as good, and she may need to be humanely euthanized.

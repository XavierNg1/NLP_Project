If you aren't trying to control an existing plant, the best place to start is in choosing a species that is compatible with your gardening style.
Some will argue that the best way to control bamboo is to eat the shoots...
If the option is available, make use of natural barriers.
Again, if the option is available bamboo can be easily controlled by planting where a lawn surrounds it on all sides by 6 meters (20 ft.) or more.
If natural barriers or a large lawn are not options for you, you must consider active methods of control.
To improve on step 5 above, dig a 12-inch deep trench around the bamboo.
The above methods are highly successful, but not perfect.

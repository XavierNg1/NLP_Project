Obtain a second USB mouse.
Cut 2 short pieces of plastic tubing, such as 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) plastic conduit.
Drill a small pilot hole in each of the two mouse buttons.
For best ease of use, take a piece of Styrofoam insulation board and cut it to around a 1 foot (0.3 m) square.
Optionally, put foam weatherstripping on top of the tubing to pad it.
Finished.

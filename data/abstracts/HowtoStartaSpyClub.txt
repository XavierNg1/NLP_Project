Gather members.
Give club a name: (E.G.
Make positions in your club, Head Spy, Scout, Tracker, Tech master, Wheel Artist, Stealth Master and Social Engineer.
Make spy names for everyone: You can give names to members (make sure they like their name!),
Create ID cards, badges, or some other token to identify people as members and what rank, position, and name they have: You may want to make this something that is inconspicuous or easy to conceal, so that it is revealed only to other spies.
Now, you should make a secret password and secret handshake for your club: To make it fun you can all make one and have a vote if someone has a better one than yours.

,
Make a clubhouse: You can use a small portion of a room, or a room altogether.
If you would like, you can make a booklet for your club called a Mission Log: and in the booklet you put all the missions you have done and if it was a good mission or a bad mission.

,
You could also make each member a Code Book so you can secretly communicate with one another using codes and ciphers.

,
If you want to, you can make a club uniform: It might be dark red, blue or green and you can also make a badge for the club as well so if you see someone with that badge you know they are in the club.

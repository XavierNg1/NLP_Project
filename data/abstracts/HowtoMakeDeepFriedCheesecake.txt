Purchase or make a cheesecake.
Cut the cheesecake 3" long x 1" wide (7.5cm x 2.5cm) in size.
Mix the egg wash. Make your egg wash for coating the spring roll wrappers.
Use a basting or pastry brush to lightly coat the spring roll wrappers with the egg wash.
Wrap the cheesecake in the spring roll wrappers.
Roll it up like you would an egg roll:


Fold the top of the wrapper over the cheesecake, then fold both sides towards the middle of the cheesecake.
Deep-fry the wrapped cheesecake pieces.
When the oil is ready, gently place a few wrapped cheesecake pieces into the pan of oil and let them lightly-brown up for 10 seconds.

,
Remove the deep-fried cheesecake pieces and repeat with the next batch until all pieces have been fried.
Coat the fried cheesecake pieces with cinnamon sugar.
Serve.

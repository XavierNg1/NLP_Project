Use creativity to plan a budget-conscious picnic that is fun for everyone without appearing to be done on a shoestring.
Select an unusual location not normally associated with company picnics, especially if you aren't too concerned about budget.
Make arrangements for employees who don't live near the picnic location.
Combine the company picnic with a teamwork retreat by planning a weekend getaway.

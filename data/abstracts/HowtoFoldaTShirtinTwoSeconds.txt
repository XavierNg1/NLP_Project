Lay the shirt flat.
Imagine a line running from the far shoulder to the bottom of the shirt.
Pinch the midpoint of this line with your left hand.
Use your right hand to pinch the end of the line at the shoulder.
Move your right hand around your left to the bottom of the T-shirt.
Use the hand pinching the shoulder to also pinch the fabric at the bottom of the T-shirt.
Uncross your hands and pick up the shirt.
Finish the fold by lowering the shirt over the loose sleeve.
Fold a few more shirts if you want to get faster.
Finished.

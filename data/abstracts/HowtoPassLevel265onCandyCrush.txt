Focus on making multiple vertical and horizontal striped candies.
Try to move any vertical striped candies into the far left and far right columns to help clear multiple double jellies at the same time.
Match any color bombs you create with striped candies, if possible.
Detonate any existing candy bombs before their timers expire.

Start with a rough outline sketch of your Herbie (also known as a Volkswagen Beetle).
Use a black ink pen to draw the basic outline of the car.
Continue to fill in the structural components of the car.
Add the smaller details that will transform this ordinary car into Herbie.
Use a cream-white to color in Herbie's "body".

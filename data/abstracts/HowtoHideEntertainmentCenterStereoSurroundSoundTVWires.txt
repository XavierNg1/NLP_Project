Draw a rough draft of the room you are working in.
Run wires where they will not be disturbed.
For power cables (source cables) try to make the supply socket reach the electronic cabinet (the place with all your devices).
Do not try to make wires 'just long enough'.
If wires must be visible, try to ensure that they are not strewn across the floor, getting in the way.
For thick cables, letting them hang off the ground is a good option.

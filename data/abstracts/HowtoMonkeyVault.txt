Warm up.
Select a rail or wall to monkey vault over.
Run up to the obstacle at a medium rate, somewhere between a jog and a run.

,
Plant with both feet 4 or 5 feet away from the rail and spring up.

,
At the same of your spring, place both hands on the rail, a little wider than shoulder width.
During your jump, tucking your feet up and bringing them between your hands.
Remember to lean forward when you are in mid air.
While you're at the top of the rail, look for your landing.
Once your feet are through, let go with your hands and prepare for your landing.
Run away and smile - you've just monkey vaulted.

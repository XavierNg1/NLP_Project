Be open and honest.
Give your teenager his own voice.
Discuss the “What Ifs.” Let your teenager know what to do in certain situations by discussing “what ifs.” Let him know what to do if he forgets his medicine or if one of his friends won’t stop pressuring him to try a new type of food.
Let your teen know that you believe and trust in them.

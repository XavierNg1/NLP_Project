Ensure safety first.
Lift the tire off of the ground.
Remove the lug bolts.
Remove the wheel from the tractor, lay it down on level ground (if possible), and remove valve stem core to fully deflate the tire.

,
Press the tire off the wheel inner rim bead so it can be taken off.
Flip the tire over and break the bead loose on the outside of the wheel.

,
Place a support on the side of the tire.
Use a tire iron or a pry bar to pry the tire's bead off the rim.
Continue to work around the tire until the whole tire is pried off the rim.
Remove the valve stem and stem locknut from the tube.

,
Pull the tube out of the wheel beginning at the valve stem and working around the rim.

,
Place the tube on top of the tire so it is in the same position it was in when it was inside the tire.
Replace the valve stem and inflate the tube so you can look for the leak.
Deflate tube and place it on a comfortable, flat working surface.
Get out (or go purchase) your patch kit.
Apply rubber cement to the area you've buffed, then wipe off the excess glue.
Peel the patch backing material off the patch.
Place the patch over the damaged spot on the tube, being careful not to allow it to wrinkle.
Check the sidewall near the location where the tube was damaged before replacing the tube.
Install a boot on any large holes or split sidewall areas of the tire.
Reinstall the tube in the tire.
Use your tire tool or pry bars to pull the tire back onto the rim.
Replace the valve stem core and inflate the tire.
Make sure the tire's bead is in line with the edge of the rim as the air pressure forces the bead into place on the rim.
Lift the tire back up and roll it close to the axle hub where it will be mounted.
Tighten the lug bolts securely.
Check the tire pressure with a gauge.

Get some freeze spray.Commercially available pet waste freezing agents made of aerosolized oxygen are available at many pet stores.
Remove the dog waste immediately.If you know for a fact that your dog has pooped, you could choose to go out immediately and collect it after your dog comes back inside.
Clear the dog waste at the end of the day.Compared with monitoring your dog’s potty time and picking up its poop each time it goes, cleaning up all your dog’s poop once each day can save you time and effort.
Pick up your dog's poo daily.
Create a regular cleaning schedule.Whether you choose to clean immediately or daily, stay committed to your plan.
Consider getting a separate trash can.If your trash service collects the garbage infrequently, you might worry about it getting stinky with dog poo.
Install a pet waste digester.A pet waste digester is a device that breaks dog poo down into a safe, biodegradable liquid that is then absorbed by your yard.

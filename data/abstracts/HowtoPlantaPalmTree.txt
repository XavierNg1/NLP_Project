Select the variety of palm you want to plant.
Opt for a small, medium, or large palm depending on budget, aesthetics, and maneuverability.
Choose the location for your palm.
Do not dig a hole or drive vehicles where underground utilities can present hazards in the location you choose.
Maneuver the tree close to the location you will be planting.
Dig your hole so that it's at least six inches wider on all sides and six inches deeper than the plantâ€™s existing root ball.
Remove the root ball cover (usually burlap or plastic) to expose the roots.
Ease the tree into position, making sure the top of the root ball is slightly lower than the level of the adjacent ground.
Straighten the tree.
Backfill the hole barely covering crown.
Stake the tree to keep it standing, if necessary.
Water the tree thoroughly.
Hold off on fertilizing the palm for six to eight weeks after planting.
Keep the tree watered as often as necessary until it is established, if the soil is gravel and sand it will need more watering.

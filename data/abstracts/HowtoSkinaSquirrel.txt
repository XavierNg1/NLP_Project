Get the squirrel wet.
Make a small cut, about 1" 1/2 (~4 cm), just underneath the base of the squirrel's tail.
Holding the squirrel, make small cuts through the skin at the back of the hind legs.

,
Holding the squirrel by the tail, separate the hind legs from the skin.
Rest the squirrel on a stump, piece of scrap lumber or other flat surface clear of dirt and leaves.

,
Grab hold of skin-free hind legs, place your heel on the flap of skin created by your initial cuts, and pull the squirrel by the hind legs.
Work out the front legs from the hide in the same manner as you did with the rear.
Continue pulling the hide until its around the squirrel's neck.
Remove the squirrel's head, arms, and feet.
Dress the squirrel appropriately.

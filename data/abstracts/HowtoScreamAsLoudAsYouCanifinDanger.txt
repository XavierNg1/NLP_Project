When you breathe in, try to breathe from your stomach, not your chest.

Scream in a higher pitch.

Try to avoid tipping your head back to do so.

Do not utilize this next tip as a first choice.

Don't be afraid to keep it up.

Try to avoid gasping.

Do not stop screaming.

Though you may feel inclined to breath in through your nose, do not do that.

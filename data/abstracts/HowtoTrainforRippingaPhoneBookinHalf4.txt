Make a thick bar barbell by first deciding on its length.
Using your new barbell, do some lifting to determine the space between the inner collars (you do not want your elbows to bump into the 25s or 50s).
Use the thick bar for most lifts, except lifts like squats, front squats and bench pressing.
Do pinch gripping of weight plates with timed holds as another alternative or as an auxiliary exercise to thick bar lifting.
Use a lever bar to:



Strengthen grip: Strengthen your grip, at the index finger, and the other fingers too.
After doing these exercises for several sessions, try ripping a phone book again.
Move on to ripping thick phone books after you can easily make a clean rip with the thinner book.
Finally, when building to a peak, do so gradually and with good form.

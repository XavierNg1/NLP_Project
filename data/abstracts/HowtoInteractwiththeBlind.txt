Always treat blind people as just another person as they simply do things differently.
Bear in mind that blind people treat their guide dogs and white canes as extensions of their bodies.
Identify yourself and others who may be with you when meeting someone who is blind.
Remember that not all 'blind' people are 100% blind.
If you offer assistance, wait until the offer is accepted.
Relax.
Be careful with terminology.

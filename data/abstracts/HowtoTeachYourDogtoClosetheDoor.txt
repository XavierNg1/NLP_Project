Use a clicker rather than only treats.
Use a little piece of paper and hold it in one hand.
Do this exercise again and again.
Now your dog is ready.
Good job!,
Continue:


opening the door a little wider each time
making the distance between you (and your dog) and the door a little bigger each time
making the piece of paper a little smaller each time (cut it in half..)

,
Continue until:


your dog knows that he's supposed to really close the door, not just touch it
your dog knows exactly what you are talking about when you say "door" even if the door is far a way or not visible from is location
your dog closes the door without a piece of paper.

Watch past video footage of Survivor shows.
Get plenty of rest, good nutrition, and reflective time in before filming begins.
Be confident.
Look as if you're enjoying yourself or at least taking it all in your stride, at all times.
Be equally nice to every single one of your fellow contestants.
Size up the drive in each of the contestants from the outset.
Be wary of tantrum throwers but equally wary of dismissing anybody as "weak".
Be supportive to those quiet yet "get-on-with-it" types at the bottom of the heap or on the fringes.
Find the one to three people with whom you feel complete trust.
Be observant and use your intuition to know when to make the moves you need to make.
Expect twists.
Try to avoid being an alliance builder or leader early on in the piece.
Be predictable and steady.
Make something up.
Be convincing.
Be at one with what will unfold.

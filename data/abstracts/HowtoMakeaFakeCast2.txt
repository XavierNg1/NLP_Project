Get a roll of toilet paper.
Break off a strip of five or six sheets.
Wet the strips.
Wrap the damp strips around your forearm or shin.
Add more water to the toilet paper.
Squeeze out any excess water.
Apply another double sheet of toilet paper of the same length.
Add a damp double strip of the same size around your wrist or ankle.
Apply colored tissue paper around the whole “cast.” If you want to create the illusion of a colored cast, then you can choose the color of tissue paper you want and wrap one or two layers of the tissue paper around the “cast” once you’re happy with it.
Wait for the “cast” to dry.
Remember to keep the limb straight.

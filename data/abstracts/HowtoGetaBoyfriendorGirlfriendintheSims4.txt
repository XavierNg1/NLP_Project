Approach a Sim you would like to go steady with.
If you haven't met this Sim, click the social interaction, "Friendly Greeting" or whatever comes up.
Find what type of personalities this Sim has.
Be friendly with this Sim until you reach the Friend zone.
Go to the 'Romantic' option and click on 'Ask if single' to see if the Sim is single or not (see Tips for how to get your desired sim single if he/she is already in a relationship).

,
Once you reach the 'Friend' zone, try to do something in the 'Romantic' option to see if this Sim likes it or not.
Go back to the 'Friend' option and keep being Friendly until you see 'Ask To Move In' option.
If the Sim agrees, move him/her to your active household in the Move menu that will pop up.
Go to 'Romantic' on that Sim and do something light, like 'Flirt' or 'Compliment appearance/personality'.
Once, in the top left hand corner, the bubble says 'thinks that is being extremely irresistible', there should be an interaction under 'Flirty' saying 'Confess attraction'.
Use a few more romantic interactions.
Click on that and then you have a boyfriend or girlfriend!

Find a photograph with interesting elements at the edges.
Take a hard look at the edges of the photograph and using a pencil begin to extend the shapes you see onto the watercolor paper.
Activate your watercolors by dropping clear water onto each pad with your brush.
Paint out from the photograph, work all sides.
Allow the painting to dry thoroughly and study it again.

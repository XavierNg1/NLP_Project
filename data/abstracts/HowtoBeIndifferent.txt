Get away from your self.
Think of life like a movie.
Know that it's no big deal.
Open your mind.
Think of the process behind the content.
Keep your facial expressions to a minimum.
Don't let your body give you away.
Stay open and receptive.
Don't enjoy it too much.
Be calm.
Be stoic.
Be objective.
Address the process.
Give the common courtesy you give to strangers to all.

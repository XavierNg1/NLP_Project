Always be looking to shoot, staying hungry for a goal.
Dart, weave, and sprint into open space to create defensive chaos.
Time your approach to crosses so that you hit them near full speed.
Check to the ball instead of always running away from it.
Challenge the defense one on one when you have space to run.
Follow all shots and crosses into the goal.
Come back to the midfield on defense, holding up the back defenders and waiting to receive the ball off a clearance or a punt.

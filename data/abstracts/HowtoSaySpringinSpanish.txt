Use Spring around Springtime.
Begin saying the word in Spanish.
Practice to your family, friends, or anyone one else you know.
If Step 2 was unclear to you about how to say it, find a local Spanish translator or translating site,(many have pronunciation: look for the icon of a loudspeaker)

Congratulations!

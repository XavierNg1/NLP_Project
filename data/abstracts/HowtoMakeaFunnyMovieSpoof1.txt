Choose a genre to spoof, not one specific movie.
Watch every movie and scene from the genre you want to spoof, taking notes.
Aim for the plot holes and start poking fun.
Invert the expectations and tropes of your film comically.
Push the "normal" of the movie you're parodying to its comical extreme.
Understand what makes the original so successful, underscoring or arguing its message.
Consider making an actor or actress the "straight man" to illustrate what is a joke and what is being taken at face value.
Don't rely purely on references to create laughs, instead using them as a jumping off point.

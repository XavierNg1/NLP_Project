Observe the break and the paddling channel from shore.

Paddle out, crossing the dredged swimming channel (that is parallel to the beach) and over the shallow inside reef of the break.
Once at the lineup, contend with the trade winds - which comes from the east (Waikiki).
The inside reef is not dangerous, ride the waves until they die out if you want to.
In shallow water always stay on the board and do not worry about sea urchins here.
If you walked to the park, bury your sandals in the sand or leave them by the lifeguard tower.
There are showers, restrooms and a snack bar at the park.

Find a spot outdoors that isn’t well-lit.
Gather a group of people and some flashlights.
Pick teams.
Determine a location for the “jail.” The size of your “jail” will depend on how many people you have on each team.
Choose one team to be ‘it.’ The easiest way to decide which team is ‘it’ would be to flip a coin.You could also choose a representative from each team to play rock-paper-scissors.
Hide!,
Tag members of the other team until no one else is left.
Continue until all of the members of the not-‘it’ team are in “jail.” A game of team flash light ends when everyone from the not-'it' team is caught and put in jail.

Watch the track crew water down the track.
Pull onto the track with the rest of the participants to drive slowly, packing the track down.
Participate in the qualifying laps.
The track will be very crowded during racing, so be cool at first until the pack spreads out and thins out.
As much as possible, stay to the outside in the straightaways and move to the inside through the turns.
When going through the turns, get the car into a slide, kicking the rear out toward the outside wall.
When turning, be careful of the infield.
Remember that you are most vulnerable when turning.
Don't pass on the outside during turns, and don't pass on the inside on the straightaways.
Drive with the transmission in the lowest gear possible.
Keep a keen eye out for debris on the track.
Plan ahead.
By the time the race is over, twenty-five laps or so, there may be only two or three cars still running at all, the rest having returned to the pits or sitting dead on the track.

Create and save styles for each level of your headings.
For heading 2, you want the formatting to be like an outline.
For heading 3, the second level of your point headings, I choose:


Before text: .89
After text: .40
First line: -.40

,
So once you made styles for each level of your headings, make sure you selected that style when writing your actual headings in your brief.
Go ahead and write in the basic headings for your opening brief (where the appellate brief body numbering system begins), such as INTRODUCTION, STATEMENT OF FACTS, CONCLUSION, PROOF OF SERVICE.

Create a new document that is twice the width and about 50% higher than your cover image.
Paste in your cover image, name the layer "Cover".
Copy the cover layer by dragging the layer down to the new layer button in the layers palette.
Double click the back layer so that the layers style window comes up.
Click on Edit>>Transform>>Perspective.
Duplicate the back layer by dragging the layer to the new layer button at the bottom of the layers palette.
Double click the pages layer and apply a white color overlay.
Move this layer down just a bit using the move tool (V).
Duplicate the page layer.
Draw a marquee around the corners that are poking out, using the lasso tool, and delete the extra bits.
Change the background to something you like better, like pure white.

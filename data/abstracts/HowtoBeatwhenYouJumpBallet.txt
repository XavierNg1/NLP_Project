Start by doing a few grand battements (high kicks).
Come away from your barre (or chair) and make your splits.
Practice some jumps.
Continue warming up for around 15 minutes, or longer if needed.
Start in either fifth or third.
Do a massive saut√© into the air.
As if you were doing a changements, bring one foot in front of the other, then move it a little further.
Before you land, bring the foot in front now to the back again.
Land softly without making a noise on the floor.
Remember, your aim is to impress your audience with how effortless it looks.

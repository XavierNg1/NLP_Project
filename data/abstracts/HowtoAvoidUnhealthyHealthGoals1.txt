Aim for moderation rather than perfection.
Consider whether your diet is negatively impacting your social life.
Check whether you are routinely cancelling social events to exercise.
Reflect on whether you view exercise as a form of compensation for poor eating.
Get medical help if you are unsure about your health goals.

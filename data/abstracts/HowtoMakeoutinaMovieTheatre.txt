Pick a movie that will get you in the mood.
Minimize the concessions.
Sit in a place where you can have some privacy.
Break the touch barrier.
Touch each other lightly.
Make eye contact.
Move your faces close together.
Gently lock lips.
Start making out.
Use your hands.
Don't forget to come up for air.
Leave your partner wanting more.

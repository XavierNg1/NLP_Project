Try meditation.
Come up with a philosophy about life, arts, politics, and philosophy.
Don't let the laws of the universe get in your way.
Try to make unusual, but semi-realistic philosophies.
Don't let people get to you if they don't like the way you look at the world.
Keep your thoughts and yourself organized--a good idea.

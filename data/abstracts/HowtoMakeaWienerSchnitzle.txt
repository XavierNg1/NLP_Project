Pound the veal cutlets, one at a time, between two pieces of plastic wrap until they become very thin.
Make sure the breaded meat sits in fat.
Set up 3 bowls.
Heat at least 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) of oil in your pan to 350 °F (177 °C).

,
Working one at a time, cover cutlets first in flour until the surface of the meat is completely dry.
Fry the schnitzel for 3-4 minutes on one side.
Serve Wiener Schnitzel with spaetzle, a hearty German potato salad, or anything else you think would fit.

Be calm and assess the situation.
If you have finished step #1 and have decided, after careful assessment, that you do not want to be friends, trust your decision.
Have your parents e-mail or call the parent of your ex-best friend.
Don't be intimidated.
Know when to seek further help.
If needed, tell the administrators in school.
If the person won't stop bothering you and harassing you, consult your parents first, and if they consent, call the police.

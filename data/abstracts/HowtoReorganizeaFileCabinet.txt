Think about how you want your file drawers to be organized.
Go through each drawer one at a time, making a brief list of the contents.
Find a clean workspace such as a desk or table and take a preliminary look through any loose paperwork.
Once all unsorted items have been separated, add any new categories to your list.

,
Look carefully at your list and decide on the most appropriate method of organization for you, your office, or your household.
Make a new, clean list of files you will need to label.
Be sure you have all of the supplies you need.
Type up and/or print out your file labels.
Go through your file drawers, one at a time, and put in the new empty files in alphabetical order.
Put an appropriate label on the outside of each file drawer and throw away all the nasty old folders.

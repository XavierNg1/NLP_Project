A solid colored background is the most basic type of background that you can put on a website.
Open your web code (source).

,
In the body tag, add an attribute called bgcolor.
Experimenting with RGB and # can lead to many shades, but you can take the easy first way.
Add the background property to the body tag, so it looks like this-<body background="SRC">
where SRC is the source of the image SRC can be in the same folder,or another folder/webpage.
Remember to type the .gif/ .jpeg /.bmp extension.

,
To add a solid colored background in CSS, add a style attribute.
Your body tag should look like this-



<body style="background-color: COLORNAME;">
where the COLORNAME is the name of the color, hex value or RGB(Also remember the last steps of the solid colored background in HTML, the are applicable here too) .

,
To add an image, add the style attribute to the body tag.
Your body tag should now look like this-


<body style="background-image:url('SRC'); ">

,
Remember that SRC is the source.
Remember to add the .extensions too.

,
To make a repeated pattern background, add a background as said in the steps above.
Fixed image backgrounds look cool and do not change as you scroll down.

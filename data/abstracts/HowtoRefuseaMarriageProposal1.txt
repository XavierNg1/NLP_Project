Request time to think about it.
Consider why you’re in the relationship.
Be firm and honest if you decide on “no.” Proposing to someone is a stressful thing to do, and you likely care deeply about this person.
Ask them to wait, if you truly are not sure.
Remember that “maybe” is an answer too.
Keep it quiet.

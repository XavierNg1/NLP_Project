Determine the size of your aquarium.
A good idea for the next step is getting some books from the library or searching for "freshwater fish species" on Google.
You need to find out how aggressive the fish you like is.
If you buy a female and male fish that might breed, find out if they will be aggressive to other fish.
Find out what food this fish likes to eat, it may be hard to find and you might find yourself with a starved fish.
Find out how hard or easy the fish is to keep.
Next, learn where to find the fish.
If you are planning a community tank, make sure the species you plan on putting together are compatible and have similar requirements.
If you still have trouble finding out what fish you want to put together, you may want to join an online fish forum for advice.

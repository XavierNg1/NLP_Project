Review your horse’s general temperament and behaviors.
Check the horse for pain and discomfort, not just in the back and girth areas, but the legs, head and mouth as well.
Check the horse’s saddle, bridle and bit for fit, positioning, wear and cleanness.
Invest or borrow a leather or elastic girth.
Pay attention when you handle the horse and be honest about that handling.
Have a mounted lesson with a good instructor.

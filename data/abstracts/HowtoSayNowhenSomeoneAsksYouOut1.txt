Keep your initial rejection straightforward.If you've just been approached by a friend for a date, the best thing you can do to start is to give your answer right off the bat.
Be honest.Even if you don't take the other person seriously as a dating prospect, his feelings still matter.
Empathize with the other person.
Offer a compliment to lessen the blow.Compliments are a good way of making someone feeling better after you've caused them pain.
Focus on the good things in your friendship.While this isn't something you have to be worried about if you're approached by a stranger, rejecting a friend can have negative consequences for the friendship you already have.
Give space and time.All rejections need time and space to heal over.

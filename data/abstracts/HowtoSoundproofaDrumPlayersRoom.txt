Dust the walls since you won't be doing so regularly and remove all artwork.

Attach the soundproofing with small picture nails, carefully nailed straight pins or small nails with heads to prevent the soundproofing from tearing over the nail.
To prevent material from tearing over the nails:


Use washer at the nail heads to prevent the material from tearing over the nail.

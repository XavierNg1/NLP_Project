If you're interested in becoming an exchange student, the first thing you should do is research programs that offer exchange trips to the country you want to live in.
Make sure you meet any admissions requirements the program may have.
Decide if you want to go for a trimester, a semester, or a full school year.
Once you've found an agency that looks promising, look into the dates they offer for departures, their pricing and financial aid, and most importantly, how they select host families and how they will place you.

,
Find the application on the site, fill it out, and send it in at least 6 months before the deadline for the date you want to leave.
If you can't afford the whole cost of tuition, apply for a scholarship or financial aid.
Once all the dates are in order, your flight is booked, your records are transferred, and your host family has been selected, do a little more research.
Talk to your school guidance office about what mandatory classes you need to take before/after your trip.
Get some background knowledge on your host family through papers or letters the agency may have sent you, or by writing a letter or email to them.
Start packing at least two weeks in advance.
Bring a good amount of spending money.
Look into getting your cell phone and your parents' cell phones programmed so you can make regular phone calls across continents.
Have fun!

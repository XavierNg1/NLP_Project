All 91 dominoes are tipped upside down and spread around to mix them up.
Each player takes twelve dominoes and stands them on edge so that their faces are visible to the owner but not to the other players.
Each player looks to see if he has the double-twelve.
Everyone organizes their dominos.
Continuing in clockwise order around the table, each player now starts to lay down his train, which is a single row of dominoes starting from the double (train station) in the center and extending towards the player (this makes it easy for everyone, including you, to remember which train is yours).
Each player continues taking a turn.
The play ends as soon as one player runs out of dominoes, or when no other domino can be played.








,
Each player scores as penalty points the spots on the dominoes they have left (so a player who ran out of dominoes will score no penalty points for that game).

A complete session would consist of 13 games, the first started with the 12-12, then the 11-11, 10-10 and so on down to the 0-0.

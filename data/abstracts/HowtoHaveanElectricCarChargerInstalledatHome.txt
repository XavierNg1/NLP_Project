Know your model.
Try going on the car manufacturer's website or go on guilds or other sites on the internet.
Inspect your garage.
Look for alternative locations.
Talk to your dealership early, in case there's a wait.
Tell your dealership your location you live, what kind of garage you have, and in all, if your garage supports the car charger.
Watch out for the 4 square sheet.
Tell the dealership about your thermostat, your oven range, sink, and other fixtures in the house.
When you are fully satisfied, sign the contract, and the dealership will file out the paperwork.
Keep your eyes open during installation.

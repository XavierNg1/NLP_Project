Use heavy weight paper, tag board, or watercolor paper, a pencil, and a set of watercolors.
Do a practice sheet of stick figures in various poses.
From the edges of the shoulder do arms in three parts:  biceps, lower arm and hand.
Work upward and at the topmost of the spine, do an oval for the head.Add elongated triangles for feet.
To flesh out one of your stick figures, mix puddle of flesh colored paint.
Begin with the center mass or torso.
Paint the neck and head shapes. 

,
Think of sausages for the two parts of the arms and legs, fatter ones for the tops of the arms and legs.
Dress this stock figure in any clothing imaginable.
Watercolor is a layering medium.
If your first attempt is not quite up to what you envisioned, repeat the process on another stick figure.Make the background as realistic as you wish---or keep it simple by painting random colors, lines and shapes to link the figures.

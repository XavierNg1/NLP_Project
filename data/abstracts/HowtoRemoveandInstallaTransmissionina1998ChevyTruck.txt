Park the truck in a place where you will be able to work on it efficiently.
Remove the positive battery cable so any electrical short circuits will be avoided.
Jack the truck up at the front end.
Remove the front drive shaft, if it is 4wd.
After you have removed all of these components, you need to drain the fluid from the transmission.
Remove the shifter linkage cable.
Remove the rear drive shaft.
Remove the starter from the engine and remove the bolts attaching the transmission bell housing to the engine block.
Use jack stands or a jack to support the rear of the transmission (and the front must not be allowed to drop, either).
Remove the transmission, keeping it continuously supported, while sliding it toward the rear of the truck -- keeping the unit in line with the engine.
Lower the transmission to the floor, and slide it out from underneath the truck, keeping it as level as possible and in an upright position.
Install it in reverse order from the removal process.

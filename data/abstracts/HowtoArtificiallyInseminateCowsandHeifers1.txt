Watch your cows and/or heifers for signs of estrus.
Twelve (12) hours after estrus is when females should be AI'd.
Calmly, with proper handling practices put the heifers or cows in to the working alley to the squeeze chute (or alleyway with just a head gate is good enough), and catch the first female in the head gate.

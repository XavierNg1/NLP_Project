Get to know your climate.
Choose a location with plenty of light.
Pick an area that you can protect from wind, foraging animals and flooding.
Don’t choose a plot where you grew tubers or had a heavy weed problem.
Prepare the base soil for your seedbed.
Amend your soil.
Clean up the soil before you place it in your seedbed.
Transport enough soil to fill 8 to 12 inches of soil to your seedbed location.
Water the soil to make it firm.
Cover the soil with a plastic sheet and leave it for 10 days.
Prepare a slug trap by burying a small yogurt container so that the lip is flush with the soil level.
Create “drills” in the soil with a hoe.
Water along the length of the seedbed.
Sprinkle seedlings just barely into the soil along the drill/row.
Rake a thin layer of soil over the “v” lines so that the level of the soil is the same as the rest of the garden.
Label the row.
Thin the seedlings after they germinate and start to grow.

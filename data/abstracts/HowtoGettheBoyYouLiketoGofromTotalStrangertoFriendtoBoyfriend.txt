Try to make sure you really like this guy, and if he's even worth your time.
Start getting to know him better.
Find common interests.
Joke around and carry a sense of humor.
Flirt!,
Ask questions.
Ask him if he's busy during the weekend.
Give him gifts.
Ramp up your flirtatious behaviour.
Ask personal questions.
Get him to be comfortable around you.
If he had an ex, find out if he's over her.
Tell him about your ex.
Hint to him that you're interested.
Ask him out on a date.
Text and e-mail him.
And once you guys have hung out and finally gotten to know a lot(but not everything) about each other, pop the question, "Have you ever pictured us, you know, "together"?",
If the guy says "I don't feel like I want to take us to next level right now.",
And if the guy says yes the first time, be cool about it.
If he doesn't like you, don't take it personally.

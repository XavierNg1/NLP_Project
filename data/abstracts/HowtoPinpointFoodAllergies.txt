If you're unsure which particular foods seem to cause problems for you, keep a food diary for two or more weeks.
Write down everything you eat and drink.
Carefully record the timing, type, and severity of reactions.
Discuss your findings with a dietitian or health care provider.
Once you have collected thorough information about your diet and symptoms and have discussed it with a medical or nutritional professional, consider performing an elimination diet or challenge test to pinpoint particular food allergies.
Select a list of foods to eliminate.
Begin the elimination diet by strictly avoiding the selected foods entirely for 1 to 4 weeks.
Keep track of all foods that cause reactions upon reintroduction.
Repeat the process if necessary until reactions disappear.
Perform an oral challenge test.
Seek a test if you're still unsure and for the sake of certainty.
Request a skin prick test.
Request a blood allergy test.

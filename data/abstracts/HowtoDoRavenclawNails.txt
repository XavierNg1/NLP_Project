Remove any old nail varnish.
Shape the nails to your personal preference.
Apply a base coat and let it dry.
Choose your nail varnish colours.
Get some nail art pens.
Bear in mind not all of the designs on each nail have to be the same.
Firstly, paint the whole nail blue.
Wait at least 5 minutes to make sure that they are dry.

,
Apply a second coat and wait 10 minutes to ensure all layers of paint are fully dry.
With a nail art pen or a thin brush, paint the tips of the nails with a bold silver or gold paint.
Leave until they are fully dried.
If you are a master in nail design or have access to a nail art professional, you could add an eagle (the symbol of Ravenclaw).

,
To finish, after ensuring the nails are fully dried, apply at least 2 layers of top coat clear varnish.
Leave the nails to dry and enjoy you new Ravenclaw nails!

Let your boyfriend know in no uncertain terms that you like to kiss him.
When he does try to kiss you, notice how he does it.
Compliment him.
Entertain the idea that you might not be a good kisser, or that he might not like the way you kiss.
Make a move.
Don't move in for the kill so fast.
Make sure you close your eyes while kissing, or it may make him feel uncomfortable, and/or bring an awkward moment.

When you start you have 5 peons, quickly grab one and send him away from the rest, while he's moving start training more peons, and then start the other 4 mining gold.
Assign your peons.
You will notice that your barracks and burrow will finish building at the exact same time or very close to it, immediately start making a grunt.
As soon as the 2nd grunt comes out you will notice your altar as well as 2nd burrow will finish building, start training your hero of choice.
Be prepared for a lot to happen at once.

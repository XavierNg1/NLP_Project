Understand what you're feeling.
Quit her!,
Stop putting her on the pedestal.
Get rid of reminders of her.
Use no more sick love songs and poems.
Get out of the house or apartment.
Remember that it doesn't matter what went wrong.
Remember your friends are still your friends and they don't think any less of you.
Don't forget who you are.
Understand that it takes time and it will get better.

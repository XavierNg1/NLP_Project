Massie has sleek, shiny, beautiful hair.
The frequency of washing your hair requires will depend on your hair type, but it's recommended that you limit your hair-washing to three times a week.
Try air-drying your hair as much as possible, for heat is your hair's worst enemy.
Since Massie has chestnut brown hair with caramel colored streaks, you may want to ask a professional to dye your own hair in a similar shade to look even more like her or dye it yourself.
Massie mainly has her hair curled, although she sometimes straightens it.

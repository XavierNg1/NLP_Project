Confide in the bride-to-be that you’re envious of her engagement.
Tell her you have a debilitating social phobia.If the idea of standing in front of a crowded church with hundreds of eyes staring at you makes you nervous, you won’t be an ideal bridesmaid.
Insist that you’re not confident in your ability to do a good job.Many brides spend an exorbitant amount of money to ensure their wedding day is perfect.

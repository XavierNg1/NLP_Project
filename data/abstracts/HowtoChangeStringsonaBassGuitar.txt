Examine the head of your guitar.
Loosen the first string via the tuner until the wraps on the winder begin to visibly relax.
Once the string is loose enough, pull it from the tuner.
Pull the string out either through the bridge or the body, depending on your particular bass.
Clean the revealed portion of your bass guitar neck with a soft cloth or towel.
Note if the old string had the correct number of winds around the tuner, use it as a template for cutting the new string of the same gauge to length.
Pull the new string of the same gauge through your bridge assembly in the exact manner you removed it.
Thread the string through and around guides, if any, being careful not to damage the string.
Pull the string taut, tighter if you want but tension is not necessary here.
Examine the wraps on the tuner; they should not be overlapping, but lay side-by-side nicely.
Bend the end and poke it into the center of the tuner.
Hold the end in the tuner and turn the key until it begins to pull tight, and bring it in close to tuned; a final tuning will be performed after all strings have been restrung.
Replace the rest of the strings following the previous steps.

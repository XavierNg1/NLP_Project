Take a partially-frozen hanger steak and cut it very thin.
Briefly saut√© onions and pepper over medium-high heat, about 5 minutes.
Coat the same skillet with enough oil and add thinly-cut steak.
With two sharp spatulas, begin to chop steak into even thinner bits.Hold the steak with one spatula while you chop it with the other.
Add onion and pepper to meat and assemble your steak in a long line roughly the size of your roll and cover with two slices of cheese.
Turn the heat off the skillet and begin to melt cheese, roughly 30 seconds.

,
Place the opened hoagie roll over top of the meat and cheese, forming a "roof.",
Slip a spatula underneath the meat and flip the spatula and roll.
Enjoy.

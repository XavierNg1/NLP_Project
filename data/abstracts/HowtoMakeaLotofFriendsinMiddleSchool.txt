Strike up a conversation.
Say nice things like "I like your shirt, where did you get it?",
Talk.
The new kid willing to sit at any table or currently sit at a table with a bunch of strangers you don't know, you should at least talk to somebody and get a couple of appropriate laughs.
Expect the unexpected.
Be Yourself.
Plan ahead.
Don't be a show off, nosey, selfish or conceited.

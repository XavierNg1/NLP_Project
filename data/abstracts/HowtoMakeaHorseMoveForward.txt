Refresh yourself with the many cues of asking a horse to move forward.
Make sure you aren't making any barriers to keep the horse from moving forward.
Relax yourself and clear your mind, look where you want to go, connect with the horse's mouth, let your legs long, and hug the horse with your legs.
If your horse won't move straight forward, trick the horse into just moving by starting the horse in a different direction.
Keep repeating the steps until your horse will move forward when asked.

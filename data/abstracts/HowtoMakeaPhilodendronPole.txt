Select a support pole.
Obtain some natural burlap.
Cut your burlap into a long strip about 8-12" wide.
Plug in your hot glue gun and let it warm up.
Take the second piece of burlap, if necessary to cover a long pole, and lay your glued pole on top of the burlap.
Wrap and fold the burlap around the pole.
Roll your pole up in the burlap, fairly tightly, and roll until it's completely rolled up.
Take your selected twine, line, or wire and tie it about 1 or 1.5 inches from the top end of the pole.
Take your desired plant and pot it into a larger pot if needed.

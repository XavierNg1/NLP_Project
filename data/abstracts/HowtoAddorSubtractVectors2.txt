Represent vectors visually by drawing them with a head and tail.
To add 2 vectors, draw the second vector B so that its tail meets the head of the first A.

Note that the order you join the vectors in is not important.
To subtract, add the "negative" of the vector.
If adding or subtracting more than two vectors, join all other vectors head-to-tail in sequence.
To get the result: Draw a new vector from tail of the first vector to the head of the last.
Represent your resultant vector via its magnitude and direction.

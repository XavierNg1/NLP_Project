Make teams.
Make a field.
Pick a kicking and receiving team.
"Kick off".
The offensive team (the team with the ball) gets 4 (or whatever you want) downs (tries) to get to the end-zone, using passing (throwing the ball to receivers) and running (giving or flipping the ball to a runner) plays.
There should be at least one defender on the quarterback counting "steamboats", or a predetermined number of seconds (counted 'one steamboat, two steamboat...') If the quarterback does not pass or make a play by the count of the last steamboat, defenders may tag the QB for a sack.
Play resumes until 4th down and the offense has not reached the end-zone or if they score with a touchdown (reach the end-zone) or field-goal ("kick" the ball into a certain large space ).
On 4th down, the team must choose to go for it, punt, or try a field-goal.
A turnover is when the defense gets the ball.
On penalties- There are several different levels of intensity for penalties - minor, for small things and accidents, which are usually about 5% back; major, which are for slightly bigger things and a little more dangerous (like tripping), and are usually 10% back; ejections, which are for very dangerous things like fighting, which is out for the game; and suspensions and expulsions, both for repeated ejections and incidents, but the prior is a certain amount of games where you're not allowed to participate, and the latter, out of the league for good.
Play resumes until a predetermined point, whether it's an hour, until the sun goes down, or a certain amount of points, it can be anything.

An attic can be dangerously hot on a summer day, So, take care to stay out of the heat as much as possible while you work on getting out of the attic.
Look around for the attic entrance, typically a small panel or staircase.
Look for a light switch to turn on so you can see what you're doing, and so (particularly at night) others may notice your presence by light escaping from the attic.

If you have a cell phone or other communication device, call for help.

,
Tap several times on the beams and the roof to attract attention.
If you are feeling weak or sick you should do something quickly to avoid collapsing and cooking.

,
Look for a spot in the ceiling made of soft material only, such as sheet rock (generally the whole ceiling in a house is made of it) or wood strips and plaster.
Alternatively, pop out a vent or grill to admit fresh air and attract attention, or escape through it if you must.
Use a tool to escape if you have it and help is not coming.

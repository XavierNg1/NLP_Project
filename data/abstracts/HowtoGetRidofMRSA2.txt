See a doctor for proper diagnosis.Most healthcare providers see many cases each week and should easily be able to diagnose MRSA.
Use a warm compress.Hopefully, you saw a doctor as soon as you suspected MRSA and caught the infection before it became dangerous.
Allow a doctor to drain MRSA lesions.
Keep the wound clean.After draining, the doctor will wash out the wound with a needle-less syringe, then pack it tightly with strips of gauze.
Take any prescribed antibiotics.

Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, ground cinnamon, and salt.
Cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.
Stir ½ cup (120 milliliters) of boiling water into the flour mixture, then add ½ to 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
Mix together the cornstarch and water.
Add in the sugar, lemon juice, ground cinnamon, and blackberries, then stir to combine.
Transfer the blackberry mixture into a cast iron skillet, then bring to a boil over medium heat.
Drop the dough in little clumps onto the blackberries using a spoon.
Place the skillet onto your foil-lined baking sheet, then bake it for 25 minutes.
Allow the cobbler to cool before you serve it.
Finished.

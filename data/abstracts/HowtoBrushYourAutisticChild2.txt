Before brushing your child for the first time, try it on yourself.
The first time you try it, demonstrate by brushing your own arm a few times.
Watch your child closely to find times when they would benefit from the brush.
Bring brushes with you when you go places.
Make brushing a peaceful and enjoyable experience.

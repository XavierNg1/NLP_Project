Include background on yourself and your relationship to the person you’re writing for.
Use an appropriate format when writing the character reference.Character references should follow a three-part format consisting of an opening introductory paragraph in which you describe who you are and your relationship to the person on whose behalf you’re writing; a second paragraph in which you lay out your analysis of the person’s character; and a closing paragraph in which you beseech the reader to look favorably upon the individual who you’re writing about.
Keep the character reference letter positive.A character reference letter is not a venue for carefully comparing the good and bad parts of a person's personality, background or lifestyle.
Do a final edit.
Adopt an appropriate tone.Character references should always be respectful and formal in tone.

Know the size of your tank.
Plan.
Go out to your local hardware store and pick up lengths of 1/2" or 3/4" PVC.
While at the hardware store, ask the clerk where you can get PVC cutters, I got a decent pair for $6.87.
Once you've got the filter pattern planned out, begin cutting and assembling the pieces outside of the empty tank.

,
After all pieces are assembled, use a hammer and nail, or a power drill to punch holes into the bottom of the PVC pipes.
Now take the completed UGF and put it into the fish tank.
Run the air tube(s) down to the bottom of the uplift tube(s).
Using proper techniques, finish setting up the aquarium (washed gravel, de-chlorinated water, additional power filter (if desired).

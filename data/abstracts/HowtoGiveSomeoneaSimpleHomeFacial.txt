Use a towel as a steamer.
Start with gently cleansing the face(get permission first!),
Wipe off the cleanser with a warm moist face towel.At this point set the steamer up if you have one and have used it before otherwise use a face towel.Wrap the rinsed warm moist towel on the face leaving the nostrils free for breathing.Leave for about 15 minutes.
Apply the moisturizer and massage in for about 5 minutes.

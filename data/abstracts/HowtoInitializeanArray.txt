Identify the data that you want to work with.Refine and decide the programming language that you will be using.
Decide whether you will need to use a one-dimensional array or a two-dimensional array.
Understand that a one-dimensional array has an index and an element.
Declare the array first, just as you would with any variable.
Initialize the array.
If you want to have access to each array in order, then you could create and use a loop to do so to prevent repetitive and unnecessary code.

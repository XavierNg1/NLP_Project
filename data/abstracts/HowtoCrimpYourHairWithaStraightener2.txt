Get some U-pins.
Apply a light weight styling mousse into clean, straightened, tangle-free hair.
Pull three-quarters of your hair up into a loose bun at the top of your head.
Take a small section of hair, closest to your face.
Place the section inside the pin.
Start wrapping the hair around the two prongs until you reach the end of your hair.
Repeat the process for the rest of the bottom layer.
Lightly mist the hair-covered U-pins with a heat protecting spray.
Set your hair straighten to medium and go over the hair-wrapped U-pins.
Repeat the sectioning, weaving, and straightening process for the next three layers.
Let your hair cool down.
Remove the U-pins.
Avoid brushing your hair.

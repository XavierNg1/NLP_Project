Mix the yeast and the warm water together in a small ramekin.
Mix yeast mixture, milk, sugar, salt, eggs, shortening, and 2 cups of the flour in a mixer on a low speed.
Beat in remaining flour, ½ cup at a time, at a low speed.
Knead the dough with your hands and knuckles for 5 minutes until the dough is smooth but elastic.

Set the dough into a greased bowl to rise.
On a floured surface, roll the dough out until it's about 0.5 inch (1.3 cm) thick.
Let the doughnuts rise again until double their size (about 30-60 minutes).
Prepare the glaze while doughnuts are rising.
Heat the oil in a deep fryer or skillet until oil reaches a temperature of 350℉ (175℃).
Slide the donuts into the oil carefully, with metal tongs or a spatula.
Remove doughnuts from oil and let drain on a wire rack.
While doughnuts are still warm, dip doughnuts into the glaze, coating evenly.

Learn to be patient with the child.
Start with the basic stuff: Alphabet, colors, animals, objects, things you might call someone else (Ex:dad, mom, sister, brother, uncle, aunt etc...).
At this point it may become a little frustrating because when you ask the child something, they may not remember it.
Playing word games is a good way to help the child to memorize the vocabulary.
Once the child has built up their vocabulary, you can teach them phrases.
By this point, the child will be able to hold small conversations.Help them learn new words they might not know, and teach them little poems or puns to help them enjoy knowing the language more

,
Be social.
Have a person in your child's life speak only in that language to help your child get to know the other language.

Be authentic about what you like.If you don’t like playing baseball, don’t do it just to impress your friends or coworkers.
Reflect on your priorities.
Don’t fear change.If you decide that you don’t like where you are, you have two options.
Spend time with the people that matter.At forty, your family might be a lot bigger than it was when you were 30.

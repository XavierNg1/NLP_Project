Ask your siblings, relatives, or family friends about whether your parents have any strong beliefs or biases about dating.
Do not talk to your parents about dating or sex, if you think it is not safe for you or your partner.
Consider talking to a counselor or a trusted adult about any problem or serious issue you might have with your parents.

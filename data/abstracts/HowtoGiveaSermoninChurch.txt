Pray effectually.
When you have decided on your topic, go ahead and make small notes on some of the references you might want to quote while giving the sermon.
Once you are done preparing your sermon, go through it many times.
Practice.
Make sure that you have enough examples to keep the crowd active and attentive.
Once you are ready to hit the stage, pray again.
Be confident.
Start with a brief introduction.
You can start the sermon reading a verse from the Bible or a small story or a joke (positive, surprising twist) and move on to your topic.
Sound genuine: though none of us are perfect, remembering all have flaws, we must accept each other.
While you quote several references from the Bible, make sure you speak something about each one.
Move!,
Look!,
Check the time!,
Be to the point and correct.
Last but never the least, give God all glory.

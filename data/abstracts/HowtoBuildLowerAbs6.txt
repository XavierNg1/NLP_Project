Start slow.
Vary your workout.
As you build your endurance, shorten the periods of rest you allow yourself between sets.
Stay motivated.
Remember: quality not quantity.
Once youâ€™re very comfortable with your routine, you may want to increase the angle of a particular movement or even attach leg weights to yourself to create a new challenge.Trying the reverse crunches on an incline, with your head pointed upslope is a good challenge once you've become familiar with the exercise.
Remember to combine ab-specific workouts with healthy nutrition and consistent all-around exercise.
Eat healthy ab foods.
Avoid foods high in saturated fats, carbohydrates, and processed or refined sugars.

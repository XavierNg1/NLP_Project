Readying to remove the timing belt, you need to turn the timing belt-tensioner pulley toward "counter-clockwise" with an Allen "el-shaped" hex tool that fits in a hole in the pulley to rotate it to be able to slip the belt off little by little.

,
Turn (pivot) the timing belt tensioner pulley toward "clockwise" with the Allen hex wrench enough to take the tension off of the timing belt tensioner spring, and then remove the spring with very long-nose-pliers.

,
Remove the tensioner pulley by one bolt in the middle (14mm).

,
Remove the "idler" pulley of the timing belt system by one bolt in the middle (14mm).

,
Remove the 4 or 5 water pump bolts which are hard to see -- (12mm) socket -- and a medium size ratchet (called 3/8 inch drive in the USA).
Clean the engine block surface carefully where the water pump gasket will make contact for sealing well -- so carefully scrape off any pieces of stuck-on old gasket material corrosion, rust, or dirt to bare metal but not gouging or roughing the metal.
Put on the "new water pump"; follow instructions that came with it.
Install the "new timing tensioner" pulley and tighten its mounting bolt securely.
Install the new "idler pulley" and tighten the mounting bolt securely.

,
Put on the "new timing belt"; follow instructions that came with it.
Press the timing belt onto place while keeping the tensioner pulley out of the way enough, using the Allen hex wrench toward counterclockwise for the pulley to be as far backed off as possible to allow the belt to slide onto the sprockets.
With the Allen wrench in the hole in the tensioner pulley for that purpose press it toward clockwise against the belt and press it in for a little tightening of the belt, and then release it slowly for the spring to bring it back into position.

,
Remove the "stopper block" from the cams -- before you put on the top half-cover on the timing belt area.

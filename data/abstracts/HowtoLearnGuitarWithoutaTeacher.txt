Learn the basics first: no matter what type of music you want to play or what type of guitar you want to use, you will need to learn some basic chords, they are extremely easy to find on the net and there are many books covering this sort of thing,also, YouTube has tons of videos for this.
Make sure you enjoy learning.
Find a buddy to play with.
Don't get ahead of yourself: The chances are, if a song sounds hard to play, it probably is (not all the time though) so take it slowly, don't try to learn an entire song at once, try to learn a group of five or six chords on a song at a time, if you try to go too fast you'll only get confused and frustrated, then you'll get nowhere.

Practise regularly: It's a lot easier to practise if you set a certain time to practise.
Stock up on supplies.
Buy a tuner.

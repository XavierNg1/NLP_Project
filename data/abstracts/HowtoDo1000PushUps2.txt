Remember to always warm up before any exercise.
Assume a prone position on the floor or other rigid surface (preferably carpeted-more on that later) that's able to support your body weight.
Make two fists and place them under yourself on the floor, approximately shoulder width apart.
Raise yourself using your arms.
Lower your torso to the ground until your elbows form a 90 degree angle.
Raise yourself by attempting to push the ground away from you.
Repeat steps 5 and 6 for the remainder of the exercise.

Stretch the chest and shoulder muscles during your cool down cycle.
If you can't use your knuckles, it's fine to place your hands flat for beginners.

Get early warning of delays caused by the client, main contractor or your own people.
Make sure the client knows when he is the cause of the delay.
Freeze design changes at a certain point to allow time for procurements and approvals.
Carefully monitor the work done by the earlier contractor(s).
Keep an eye on what your team is doing that might cause delays.
"Mitigate" the impact of the delays: accelerate work, use up your "float" and redefine the "critical path."

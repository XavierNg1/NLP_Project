Hang herbs to dry them for a quick preserving method that doesn't require too much effort.
Remove lower leaves from the stems and tie the bunch of herbs together close to the top of the stems.
Find a dry, warm (not humid), dark and well ventilated place that is out of the way of pedestrian traffic or constant rummaging.
Leave the herbs to dry for 1 - 3 weeks.
Remove the leaves and bottle them in airtight glass herb jars (or other jars you have around).
Label the jar and date it.

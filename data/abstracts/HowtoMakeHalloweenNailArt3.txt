Choose your nail polishes.
Paint the pink base coat and allow it to dry.
Designate which nails will hold a skull.
Create the skull by painting a round circle in the middle of the nail using white nail polish.
Paint the skull's eyes, mouth and bow once the skull paint has fully dried.
Paint a small white (or black) heart on the other nails.
Add the top coat when your skulls, bows and hearts are fully dried.

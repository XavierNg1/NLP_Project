Pack softer and more bulky objects near the bottom of the pack.
If you use a Camelbak (water bladder), that should also be close to your back, preferably in a pouch.
Pack "middle weight" objects around the middle of the pack.
Lighter objects that may need to be accessed quickly should be near the top of the backpack.

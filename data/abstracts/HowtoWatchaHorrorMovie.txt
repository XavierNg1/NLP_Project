Read about the movie before you watch it.
Use what you've read about the movie to decide whether or not you want to watch it.
Consider starting with the right level of horror movie.
Go to the bathroom before starting the movie, especially if it's at night.
Gather together some pillows and blankets to make a cozy area or even a fort.
Watch it with someone else.
Peek rather than watch.
Cover your eyes during the scary parts.
Peek through your fingers slowly, and then cover your eyes again.

Keep saying to yourself, "This is not real!",
Watch the commercials on how the movies were made.
When there is suspenseful music playing, brace yourself.

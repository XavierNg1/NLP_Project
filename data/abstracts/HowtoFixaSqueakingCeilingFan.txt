Turn the ceiling fan off, and allow the blades to coast to a complete stop.
Grasp each blade and wiggle them to see if any of the fasteners (usually phillips type screws) are loose, and if so, tighten them.
Look for excess dust accumulated on the blade surface, especially the top.
Check the globe or globes on the light kit if the fan is equipped with one.
Tighten the set screws that holds the globe in place.
Test the fan to see if any of the above steps have helped quiet the squeak.
Rebalance the blades on your ceiling fan.
Recheck to see if the squeak is diminished or not.

Position a foam roller onto a sturdy, carpeted surface and lie down onto it with the small of your back.
With your back slightly raised and your legs anchored to the ground, begin to roll on the foam roller.
Continue comfortably rolling on the roller until your lower back cracks.
Try a lower-back alternative with the foam roller.
As an alternative, extend your entire leg into the air and roll over the roller.

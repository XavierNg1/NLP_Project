Decide how large your blanket will be and chain the appropriate amount, using yarn A.

Insert the hook into the second chain from the hook.Turn your project around so that you are now holding the opposite hook.

Attach yarn B with the traditional slip knot.

With that same hook and yarn B, build the stitches back onto the hook.
Let go of yarn B and turn your project so you are now working with the other hook.
Yarn over and pull through two of the loops on the hook.

With each color you will remove all the loops, add all the loops, and then turn the project.
To finish, work the stitches off the hook, as in step 4, until you have only one loop remaining.

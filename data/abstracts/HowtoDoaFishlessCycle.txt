Set up your tank, but do not add any fish.
Leave the tank running for 24 hours to ensure that the equipment is working as it should be and there are no leaks.

Calculate the volume of ammonia required to raise the level in the tank to 2-4ppm.
Add the required volume of ammonia to the tank.








,
Test the water every 24 hours and wait to see the ammonia reading drop.
Add more ammonia to raise the level in the tank back up to the level you chose to start with.
Wait until the nitrite level starts to drop, (they will be sky high for a few weeks) continuing to add ammonia to feed the bacteria in the tank.
When you have 0ppm of ammonia, 0 ppm of nitrite, and a nitrate reading, your tank is ready for fish.








,
Continue adding ammonia until you add your fish.

Understand why you can't "cure" family members of codependency.
Recognize that just being your unmovable, unshakable, un-manipulatable self will have an impact on your family.
Develop less emotionally-charged ways to say "no".
Expect change to be slow.
Realize that the best way to deal with codependency is to get away from it.
Treat other family members as if they are emotionally mature.
Recognize that co-dependence may be an issue where you are the "child" and your parents (often parents who have always felt entitled to everything) are often the immature, codependent ones.

Fret a note, play it, and slide to another fret without picking up your fingers.
Keep your finger pressing down hard against the string for the entire slide.
Slide into notes for a smooth start to a solo.
Aim for slides on your 3rd and flat 5th notes for extra bluesy playing.
Know that you can slide across multiple strings.

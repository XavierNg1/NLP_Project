Grow old gracefully, not by being stuck in time.
Get medical attention where needed.
Be respectful.
Tip generously if you live where tipping is required.

Realize that your hairdresser sees many clients and won't have a photographic memory of your last cut.
Don't skimp when it's your kids.
Try to make a two-way conversation.

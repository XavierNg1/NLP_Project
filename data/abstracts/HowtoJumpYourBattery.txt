Get a working vehicle.
Verify that both the dead battery and the rescue battery have the "same" voltage.
Position the vehicles so that the car batteries are close enough to each other for your jumper cables to reach each one.
Turn off both engines.
Turn off the headlights, wipers, radios, and all accessories on both cars.
Untangle and unwind the jumper cables.
Visually check both batteries for cracks, leaks, and damage.
Connect a red clamp "first" to the positive (+) post on the dead battery.
Connect a black clamp to the negative (-) post of the good battery.








,
Connect the only remaining clamp (a black clamp for the car with the dead battery) to a solid piece of unpainted, grounded metal on the dead car.
Start the working vehicle.
Let it idle for approximately five minutes before trying to start the other car.
Try to start the disabled vehicle.
Remove the jumper cables from the vehicles in the reverse order from when you attached them.
Keep the recently disabled vehicle engine running a little above idle for at least twenty minutes to charge the battery.

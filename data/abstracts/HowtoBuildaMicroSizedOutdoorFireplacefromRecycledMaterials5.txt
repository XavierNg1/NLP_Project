Bend the long side of the steel wire on the damper segment into a U-turn so that the backwards-facing part is twice as long as the forward facing part (see picture).
Make a small loop at the end of the damper wire, and tie some thin string to it.
Run the thin string down through the loop attached to the brick.
Test your damper; it should rotate from open to closed to open again when you pull the string.

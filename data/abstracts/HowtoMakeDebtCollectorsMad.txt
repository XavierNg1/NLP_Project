Know your rights: Every state and the federal government have laws designed to prevent debt collectors from harassing consumers.
Validate the debt: Every collector, especially those that are trying to scam you, wants you to just pay on a debt.
Verify the debt: Verification is a lot like validation.
Consult a lawyer: Like with validation/verification, debt collectors hate it when a lawyer or a law firm gets involved.
Sue the collector: If the debt collector violates the FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act) you can sue them.
Pay the debt: You’re probably asking “how is paying on the debt going to make a debt collector mad?

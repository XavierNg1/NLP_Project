Wear light clothing!!!,
No flip-flops!,
Be aware of your backpack!,
Wrap the strap of your camera around your wrist so it won't fall or break.

You're going to see a lot of mosh-pits and crazy stuff going on so be careful!,
Water is very important.
Don't wear make-up!,
Don't act like a total fan when you get to meet the bands you wanted to see.
Bringing friends will make everything funner, funnier, and more memorable!

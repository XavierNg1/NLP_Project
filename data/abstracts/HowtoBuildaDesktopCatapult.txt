Buy the materials needed for the project.
Assemble your tools on a convenient workbench or other suitable location.
Cut out the following required pieces.
Lay out plywood for holes required for the frame, as shown in photo.
Drill holes with a 15⁄32 inch (1.2 cm) bit to install uprights at the 9 inch (22.9 cm) mark.
Drill holes with the 15⁄32 inch (1.2 cm) bit at the one inch marks at a 50 degree angle to the board.

,
Drill one hole with a 5⁄16 inch (0.8 cm) bit in each 18 inch (45.7 cm) by 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) dowel at 6 inches (15.2 cm) and 1 inch (2.5 cm) from one end.
Drive the 18 inch (45.7 cm) by 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) dowels into the holes on the 9 inch (22.9 cm) marks.
Glue the dowels together where they meet at the top, then lash them with twine for support.
'Taper the ends of the 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) by 7 inch (17.8 cm) dowels with sandpaper so they fit snugly into the two holes at the top of the upright 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) dowels, then spread the uprights to fit them in.
Lash the 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) by 18 inch (45.7 cm) dowels to the upright 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) dowels with twine, then hot glue the twine to prevent it from slipping.

,
Assemble the two 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) by 18 inch (45.7 cm) dowels together, parallel, with space blocks between them cut from the same material.
Spread the uprights sufficiently to install the launch arm, then replace the cross arms, gluing them into position.

,
Carve a suitable "cup", or projectile holder from your scrap of 2X4 lumber, rough shaping it with a circular saw, then rotary rasps, and finally a sanding disk or sandpaper.
Lash the projectile cup into the notch at the end of the launch arms using the twine.
Glue or lash guide pieces for the travel of the launch arm between the two cross beams, and from the base diagonally up the path of travel of your arm.
Fasten a spring at the bottom of the launch arm to a point on the opposite side of the base, using twine.
Trim any loose strings, check all glue joints, and you should be ready to fire.
Finished.

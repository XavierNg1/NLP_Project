Let nature take its course.
Monitor the tooth as it gets looser.
Advise your child to wiggle the tooth with their tongue.
See a dentist if the new tooth grows in an unexpected location.
Note that there should not be much blood.
See a dentist if the tooth is still loose but not extracted after 2 to 3 months.
Hold gauze over the extraction site.

Restrict yourself to one or two skeins of yarn and one or two pairs of needles.
Choose your yarn carefully, because each type of project you make needs a specific type of yarn: super fine (thinnest type of yarn), fine, light, medium, bulky, and super bulky (thickest type of yarn).
Get the appropriate knitting needles.
Get a yarn needle (or tapestry needle).
Put all of your new knitting accessories in a serious knitter's tote to keep them all together.

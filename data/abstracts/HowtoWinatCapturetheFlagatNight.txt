Get hold of either camouflage or a dark outfit.Build up speed and endurance before the game will go down.
The night of the game, (after it starts) move carefully to the border, crawling or staying low at all times.
Once you reach the enemy flag on a two way radio call for a distraction 100–200 yards (91.4–182.9 m) opposite and behind your location.Grab the flag and wrap it around your arm so less of you seems to attract attention,
Call for a party of 4-5 people once you reach the border to surround you and run very fast to the border.
Celebrate like crazy.

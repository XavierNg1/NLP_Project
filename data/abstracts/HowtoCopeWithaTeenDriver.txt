Know that the teenage driver is experiencing a flood of emotions/thoughts just as you are.
Try discussing the scenario with them.
See if they have any questions that you may be able to answer.
Give them some tips.
Are you paying for their insurance?,
Do you have other children that you are constantly taking places?,
Does your teenage driver have their own car?,
Is your teenager abusing his/her new-found freedom?,
Do not EVER yell at, criticize, or lie to a teenager.
DISCUSS the situation with them.

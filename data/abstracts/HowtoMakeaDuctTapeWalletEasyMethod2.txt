Cut six 12-inch (30.48 centimeters) long strips of duct tape.
Lay three of those strips down, sticky-side-up, with the long edges overlapping by Â¼-inch (0.64 centimeter).
Lay the other three strips on top of the duct tape fabric, sticky-side-down.
Trim the sides of the duct tape sheet so that it is 11 inches (27.94 centimeters) long.
Cut one of the narrow edges into a point or curve to make the wallet flap.
Fold the sheet into thirds, widthwise.
Cut a strip of duct tape, then cut it in half lengthwise.
Seal the sides of your wallet with the narrow strips of duct tape.
Use a Velcro dot to close the flap.

Find someone you may be interested in meeting.This can be anywhere... a book store, bar, restaurant, shopping center, etc.
Relax.
Glance casually in her direction.
Don't stare.
Meet her gaze with a smile.
Avoid examining her.
Try to read her facial expression.
Let her be the first to break eye contact.
Continue to look.

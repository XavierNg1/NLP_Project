Brush their teeth once to twice a month.
Begin by putting a tiny bit of some specially made ferret toothpaste onto an extra soft baby brush.
Have someone scruff the ferret for you so you can brush their teeth more accurately.

,
Gently open the ferretâ€™s mouth using your finger (make sure your finger is clean!),
Make sure you get the back teeth too because this is mostly where they chew their food.
Once you are done, give them some water so the taste of the toothpaste goes away and you may give them a treat too.

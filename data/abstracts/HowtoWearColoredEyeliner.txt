Pick the right color.
Do not overwhelm your look with garish or childish colors.
Choose your formula.
Embrace your choice.
Keep the rest of your makeup simple.
Get close to the lash line.Colored eyeliner really works best when it is as close as possible your lash line.
Keep the line thin and precise.Itâ€™s easier to add to your lined eyes rather than remove the liner.
Have fun with bold looks.

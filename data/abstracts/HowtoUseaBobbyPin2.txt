Make sure that you have bobby pins.
Separate a segment of hair near your face, along your hairline.
Pull the parted section back toward the crown of your head, so that it is perpendicular to your hair that is falling naturally downward.
Use your index finger to twist the parted segment of hair a few times.
Lay the twist against the side of your head.
Grab a bobby pin and reach around behind your head.
Open the split tip of your bobby pin with your fingers and place it where you want your twist to stop.
Slide the bobby pin underneath the twist so that it is hidden by the hair.
Clean up any stray hairs.

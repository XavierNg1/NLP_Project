Prepare a grave.
Ask all the mourners to arrive in their black clothes so the ceremony can begin promptly.

When everyone has written their burdens, take them to the burial ground in a solemn procession and circle the grave (if you made one).
Light the candle.
Begin with one of your burdens first, since you are the Mistress/Master of Ceremonies.
Cover the grave and give each mourner a note card that has the following inscription: "Goodbye burdens, I don't need you anymore, I am complete as I am.
Lead your procession away from the grave and change from your mourning clothes to your happier attire.

You can now have a small party or celebration to invite new, happy memories and expectations into your life.
Go on in life without these burdens and be happy.

Catch up the laundry.
Clear the clutter.

If you store cleaning supplies in the laundry room, dispose safely of any hopelessly outdated stuff, especially if you don't use it anymore or the container appears to be in danger of spilling its contents.
Organize what remains.
Dust the walls and cabinets.
Wipe off the outsides of your washer and dryer.
Clean any counter tops and wipe out the laundry sink, if you have one.

Clean out your dryer vent about once a year.
Sweep and mop the floor, and shake or hose out any scatter rugs or mats.

If you have hard water, try running a wash load with vinegar in it periodically.

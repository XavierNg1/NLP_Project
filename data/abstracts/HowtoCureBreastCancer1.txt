Determine the stage and severity of your breast cancer.Before being able to realistically discuss treatment options with your doctor, you will need to know the details of your breast cancer.
Opt for surgery.If breast cancer is detected, the most common first line of treatment is surgery.
Consider chemotherapy.One of the areas of greatest growth in the treatment of (and cure for) breast cancer is in the development of a variety of different chemotherapy options.
Have your axillary (armpit) lymph nodes examined.Since surgery is almost always the first-line approach to the treatment (and cure) of breast cancer, at the same time as the surgery is being performed the surgeon can also take a first-hand look at the lymph nodes surrounding your breast and in your armpit.
Follow-up with regular screening after treatment.Even after you have been cured of cancer (or after your breast cancer is in "remission," meaning that it can no longer be picked up on medical tests), you will need to continue with regular screening to detect any possible recurrences.

Cut some 4-inch lengths from #3 and #5 ribbon until you have enough to create cones around the entire edge of one cardboard backer.
Overlap the pieces and twist both ends in the same direction to form a cone shape.
Once you've completed enough cone-shaped ribbons, staple them to the back edges of the cardboard backer.
Fill in the spaces between the cones with a second row of cones using the second color of ribbon.
Remove the stem from the mum flower.
Take the backer of the pointed ribbons and glue the mum to the front middle of the backer using a hot glue gun.
Pick up #5 and #9 ribbon in the color of your choice and cut several 48-inch-long strips.
Take your 48-inch pieces and fold them in half to create 24-inch streamers.

,
Overlap the folded ends of the 24-inch streamers on the bottom of your second backer.
Once your backer looks full of ribbons, embellish the lengths of the ribbons with any sort of decorations you desire.
Make a military braid from your ribbons if desired.
Tie on bells using curling ribbon if desired.
Take two 5-inch pieces of #5 and #9 ribbon and overlap them several times to form a loop.
When you are satisfied with your embellishments, glue the third backer with the safety pin loop onto the back of middle backer to cover staple edges and protect clothing from staple snags.

,
Glue the middle backer containing the ribbons to the to the back of front backer containing the mum and the points.

,
Lastly, glue any central charms on the mum and add any final touches to the piece.
When you are ready to wear your mum, take your large safety pin and thread it through the loop you created on the back backer with the two 5-inch pieces of ribbon.
Finished!

First of all, if you don't have the number of your crush, this won't work.
Call.
When your crush finally answers and most likely says "Hello," you might usually say, "Hi.",
If they ask why you asked for their number, then say to them, "Oh, I don't know.
Whenever you both get silent, ask a question such as, "So... are you planning to go anywhere for (insert holiday or break here)?",
Don't ask them out over the first phone call!,
At the end of the phone call, if you say got to go, say to them, "So... want me to call you back tomorrow?"

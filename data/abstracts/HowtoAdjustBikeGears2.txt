Raise the bike of the ground on a bike stand.
Shift to your lowest gear.
Unscrew the bolt holding the cable in place.
Locate your derailleur's "limit screws.",
Tighten the screws to keep the chain from falling off.
Using your hand, push the rear derailleur to the inside of the bike as far as you can.
Adjust the front derailleur so that the derailleur plates sit on either side of the chain.
Bolt the cable back to the derailleur.
Use the cable adjusters to adjust your gears properly.

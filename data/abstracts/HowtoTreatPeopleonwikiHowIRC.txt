Don't assume that someone is trying to cause trouble or start an argument.
Don't be confrontational.
Use the opportunity to teach someone.
Do not take things personally.
If you are an IRC admin, take the above steps to the next level...be less confrontational, more willing to teach, less willing to take things personally.

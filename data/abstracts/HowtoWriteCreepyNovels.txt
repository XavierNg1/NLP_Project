Observe creepy surroundings.
Find a group of people who love zombies, giant bugs, or horny french people, and hang out with them for a while.
Loiter outside of an old bookstore on the outskirts of town.
Buy books in the 'creepy' genre.
If you have a backyard or a porch, try staying outside and staring up at the sky in case you see any UFOs flying by.

,
If you have ever been abducted/had a conversation with extraterrestrial life, use this as 'inspiration' or perhaps, write a story about your experience.

,
When you begin to write your creepy novel, think of words that go with your theme.
Once you have figured out a title, be prepared to start writing an introduction to your creepy novel.
Once you've written the introduction, start writing the details of the story and outlining your characters.
Once you have written down most of the novel, begin formulating ideas on how to end your lovely, creepy novel.
Congratulations!,
If your book was unusually successful, consider writing a sequel.

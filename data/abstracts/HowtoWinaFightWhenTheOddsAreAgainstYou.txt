Don't get hit.
Keep those eyes on every open spot.

Stay back, then sneak up and swipe kicks with the goal of making your opponent fall.
Take your time breathing, inhaling, and exhaling.
You have won, but you need to breathe as they do.
Sacrifice.
A fight is like water, its flow can be controlled if you know what you're doing.

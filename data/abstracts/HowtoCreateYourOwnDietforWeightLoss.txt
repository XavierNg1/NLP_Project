Find out what your diet is now.
Keep a careful food diary for seven “normal” days.
In your food diary you will record for each day:

,
What am I eating?,
How many calories do I consume in a “normal” day?,
Add the calories for all seven days and divide by seven.
Design the new diet.

A safe weight loss, one that will most likely be permanent, is one pound a week.
As much as possible, substitute healthier foods that you like and smaller portions of higher calorie foods you like in order to reach your new lowered daily calorie count.
Go through your seven day record and see how many meals you can redesign to be just as satisfying to you, but less caloric.
If you are not exercising, think about slowly fixing that part of your life, too.

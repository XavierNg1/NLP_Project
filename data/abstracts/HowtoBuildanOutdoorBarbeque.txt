Pick a spot to build an outdoor barbeque that is away from trees, fences or anything flammable.
Mix the mortar using 1 part Portland cement, 3 parts masonry sand and Â¼ part hydrated lime.
Lay the first course (layer) of bricks.
Fill in the rest of the walls between the corners, checking that each course is level as you go.
Form the shelf for the fire pan when you reach the fifth course.
Add 3 more courses of bricks, and then repeat the above step to create a shelf for the grate.








,
Finish the barbecue by laying 2 more courses of bricks around the cooking areas (the left-hand leg, middle and halfway across the back wall).








,
Run a 3/8-inch-diameter pipe along all the mortar lines before the mortar sets.

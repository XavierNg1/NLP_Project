Lightly grease the inside of a 2-pint (1 litre) baking dish with butter.
Prepare the bread slices.
Place a single layer of bread slices, buttered-side-up in the bottom of the dish.
Spread a layer of sultanas across the bread, then sprinkle them with some cinnamon.
Repeat the bread, sultana, and cinnamon layers until you have no more slices of bread left.
Heat the milk and cream in a small saucepan over low heat until it starts to steam.
Beat the eggs and three-fourths of the sugar together in a small bowl.
Slowly stir the milk mixture into the egg mixture.
Pour the custard base through a strainer and into a clean bowl.
Pour the custard base over the bread, then sprinkle the remaining sugar and ground nutmeg on top.
Let the bread pudding stand for 30 minutes.
Bake the pudding in a preheated oven at 355°F (180°C), for 30 to 40 minutes.
Let the pudding cool for a few minutes before serving it.

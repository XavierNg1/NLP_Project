Acknowledge that you are as imperfect a person as the one who has hurt you.
Try to understand the other person; ask yourself what kind of suffering has occurred in his/her life; what kind of struggles has this person gone through that has made him or her hurt you so badly.
Recognize that as long as you stay angry at this person, he or she will have power over you.
Ask God to help you in this process.
Forego any desire for revenge.
In forgiving, you are not agreeing with what happened.
Understand that forgiveness and reconciliation are separate concepts.
The Bible does not allow personal payback: "Vengeance is Mine, says the Lord; I will repay", but promoting justice is a separate issue from personal forgiveness.
Know that Jesus promises rewards to those who overcome feelings like wanting to be unforgiving: "But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you... For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?"

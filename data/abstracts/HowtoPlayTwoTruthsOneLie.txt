Introduce the rules to the group.
One person lists three "facts" about themselves, except one of the "facts" is a lie.
Have a general discussion about the three "facts".
The other people guess which one is a lie.
The person sets the record straight by saying the lie, e.g. #2 was a lie.
Scorekeeping - Give one point to the "fact giver" for each person they fooled.
The next person goes.

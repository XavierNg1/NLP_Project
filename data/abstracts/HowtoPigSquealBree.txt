Breathe in heavily to get the feeling of what is required to perform this technique.
Try breathing in heavily again, adding a raspy quality to the inhale.
Achieve correct lip and tongue placement to achieve different tones, the last step is to learn to "pull" in forcefully enough (still with the raspy quality mentioned before) to add a high-pitched squeal to the noise.(The only steps that actually need to be performed are the third and fifth, but steps one and two help to further understand, and warm up to this vocal trick conceptually)

,
Try to pig squeal while breathing in it is almost impossible to do breathing out .
Try doing this without breathing out, if you'd like.

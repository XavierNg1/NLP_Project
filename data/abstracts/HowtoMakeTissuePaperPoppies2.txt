Spread a piece of red, orange, yellow, pink or gold tissue paper on a flat surface.
Fold each tissue paper square twice, so the folds make four equal quarters.
Push a green pipe cleaner up through the bottom of the shape, with about an inch of the pipe cleaner extending above the circle, then bend the extending inch of pipe cleaner in a hook shape.
Finished.

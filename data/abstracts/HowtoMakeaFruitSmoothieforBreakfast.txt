Start with a clean, variable powered blender.
Start with your liquids.
Add one quartered banana.
Put in 4 ounces each of the other 3 fruits of your choice.

,
Start the blender on the slowest speed and let it run for about 30 seconds.

,
Increase the speed, gradually, until you can see a good vortex forming on the top of the mix.
Once it gets smooth enough to hold the vortex, let it run for one minute.

,
You should be able to increase the speed just until the vortex creates a small hole in the center without closing.
Pour into your glasses and garnish as desired.

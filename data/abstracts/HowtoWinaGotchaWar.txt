Learn to identify when you're being drawn into a Gotcha War.
If you're in an "argument" that drifts from whether something is correct to whether someone is correct, it's probably not a legitimate argument but a "Gotcha War".Much that is said about "winning" an argument without regard to truth is really about how to "win" a Gotcha War.
Know who is most likely to draw you into a Gotcha War and for what sorts of reasons.
Put a stop to the argument.
Be aware of your posture and body language.
Respond as little as possible to anything the other person says.
Maintain the minimal response approach.
Wait for the conclusion.
Let go of it.

Try to keep to your normal schedule as much as possible.
Go into your new dwellings first before you bring your pet in.
Once you are sure that it is safe, release your pet from the carrier or the leash.
Lay out familiar items, such as a familiar bed and toys.

,
Take time out to play with your pet.
Make sure that you update their ID tags.
Go over your new yard very carefully and make sure it is dog or cat proof, there are no harmful items or chemicals, the gates close, the fence is secure and your pets can't escape.
For outdoor cats, keep them inside for a few nights until they get acclimatized.
Enjoy your new home with your pet!

Hold the beer can horizontally, and make sure you're using an aluminum can.
Puncture a hole on the side of the can, near the bottom.
Quickly place your mouth over the hole, so that any precious beer-nectar doesn't spill all over the place.
After you've tilted the beer upright, quickly crack open the beer tab on the top.
Drink as fast as you can.

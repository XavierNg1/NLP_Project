After bleaching your hair to a pale yellow, allow it to dry.
Apply the Manic Panic as you normally would do.
Allow this color to set in for hours if you have the time.
Wash out the hair color, but don't use shampoo.
Style as usual.
After the hair dye process is completed, don't use regular shampoos.

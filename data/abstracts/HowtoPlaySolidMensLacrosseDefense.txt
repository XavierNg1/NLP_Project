Keep your stick on your man.
Communicate - talking to your fellow teammates makes defense much easier.
Dodge from up top: If an opposing midfielder is carrying the ball at the point (area opposite the goal outside the restraining box) and looks like he is doing to dodge, try to channel him down one alley on the field.
Dodge from the wing: If an opposing midfielder or attackman is looking to dodge from the wing (area adjacent to goal along Goal Line Extended) your primary objective is to not let him get Top-side (imagine a long line extending from both goal posts at a 45 degree angle heading toward the sideline.
Dodge from X: If an opposing player tries to dodge from X (area behind net) channel him to whichever hand you desire, because most players at X will be very good in both hands.
Use good foot placement: If the attack man is walking side to side don't cross your feet try shuffling it will lower the chances of you falling and it will make it easier to catch up to your opponent if he beats your.And if beat push off with the inside of your feet not from the outside this will also lower the chance of injury and falling.

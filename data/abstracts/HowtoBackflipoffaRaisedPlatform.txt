Find something to do the backflip off of.
Get on top of the platform you have decided on.
Determine whether or not your platform is stable, and then take your stance.
Prepare to perform the flip.

,
Begin the flip by digging down.
Jerk your arms forward, and start to jump at the same time.
Keep pulling your head back and bring your legs over your head by pulling your knees forward.
As soon as your feet hit the ground, bend your knees, so you don't experience a shock from landing with stiff legs.
Stand back and bask in the glory.

,
Finished.

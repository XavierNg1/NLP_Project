Mix hydrogen peroxide into your solution.Measure out 10 cubic centimeters of 20 volume hydrogen peroxide.
Move your solution into a separating funnel.Pour the solution from the beaker into a separating funnel.
Use cyclohexane to extract the iodine.Pour 10 to 20 cubic centimeters of cyclohexane into the separating funnel.
Place your cyclohexane mixture into an evaporating dish and fume cupboard.Pour the remaining solution into an evaporating dish.

First off, make sure that your relative or friend is going out with your crush.
Now that you are sure, try to find out if this is a one off fling or something a bit more long-term.
You now know that your crush is taken.
Take in a deep breath and count to ten.
Try as much as you can to avoid catching sight of them at any cost.
Hang around with other good mates and if you really feel like it, tell another close and trusted friend about how you feel.
Still be friends with your mate - it isn't her fault she fancies your crush.
Get involved with other activities so you can meet new guys.
Be 'just mates' with your crush.

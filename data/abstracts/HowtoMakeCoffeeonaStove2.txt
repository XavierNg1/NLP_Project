Understand how a moka pot works.
Preheat enough water for the bottom moka pot chamber in a separate kettle or pot.
Fill the bottom chamber of the moka pot with the water, almost to the valve ring.
Fill the basket with coffee, leveling the coffee off with your fingers.
Screw the top and bottom of the moka pot together.
Place the moka pot on the stove over moderate heat, leaving the top lid open.
Wrap the pot with a cold dish towel or run it under cold tap water.
Pour your finished brew into cups or a carafe.

Assess yourself.
Compile a list of all the local crisis centers and their contact information.
Pick two or three crisis centers that you would like to contact, so that you can focus on your favorite or most convenient ones.
Call the center of your choice and find out what kind of screening process they have for potential volunteers.
Meet with the center director or head volunteer.
If all goes well, you should be able to start training.
Once you pass all the criteria that the center has for you, they may team you up with another volunteer for your first sessions.
When you have proven that you are an able call-taker, the center may set you off on your own.

Keep natural hair.
Oil your hair using natural sprays, creams, and moisturiser.
Air dry and use a thick wide comb when damp, rather than using a hot hair dryer comb.
If you have a weave, wrap your hair when you sleep, though this is a basic.
Leave space between each weave, about as much space between each weave as you last kept it in.
Think long and hard before using chemicals.
Make sure you follow instructions on a perm before you have one, always.
Know something about the type of makeup you want, if any.
Get darker "nude" colored lip liner and lipstick.
Don't wear too brightly colored mascara with black eyelashes.
Do not ever buy foundation too light for your skin color.
Choose the right type of products.
Be fashionable, but don't ruin your hair and complexion to do so.
Using a hot comb can straighten black people's hair, but like the hair dryer extension, can damage it just as much, or even more if it's very dry.

Don't drastically change the way you look.
Do not ever try 'acting like a black girl or white girl' to fit in.
Remember, not everyone who's not black is racist either.

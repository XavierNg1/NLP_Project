Understand that this strategy for how to win only works with the form of the game "Splits".
The strategy to always winning once you have gone second is to tap the opponents hand as infrequently as possible.
From (3),(0) against (1,0) and it is your turn, it is ideal to split to (2,1).
From 1,1 against 1,0, (your opponent's turn) is one of the easiest wins in the game.
Of course, there is always the person that thinks that they're tricky by starting out splitting to 2,0 as their first move.

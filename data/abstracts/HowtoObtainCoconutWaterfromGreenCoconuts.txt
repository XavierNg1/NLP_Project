Locate a stand of coconut trees.
Find a long straight tree branch 8–10 feet (2.4–3.0 m) trim off side branches.
Take a bootlace or strip of cloth about three ft long.
Pick out a coconut.
Turn the stick so that the loop twists over the top of the coconut until tight.
Inside the shell, you should find a layer of young coconut meat.

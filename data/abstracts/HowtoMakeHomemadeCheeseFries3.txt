Slice about a pound of russet or white Idaho potatoes lengthwise into half-inch slices.
Dry the strips with a paper towel and brush all the sides of the potatoes with some oil- it can be any kind, such as peanut, sunflower, safflower, olive, or plain vegetable oil.

,
Heat about half an inch of oil in a skillet to almost boiling.
While you are cooking the potatoes, take half a small brick of Velveeta or other melting cheese, place in bowl, cover with saran wrap, and microwave for one minute at a time until melted, stirring occasionally.
When the potatoes are done, serve immediately with the cheese sauce!

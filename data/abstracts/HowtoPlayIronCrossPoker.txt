Shuffle up a standard 52 card poker deck, blind-in or ante-up, and deal five hole cards to each player.
Place the first community card face up just left of center on the table.
The first round of betting opens to the left of the dealer if playing ante - or after the big blind if playing blinds.

,
Once betting round one is complete, deal the second community card face up above and just to the right of the first community card.
After the fifth community card has been dealt, the final round of betting begins.

,
All remaining players after the completion of betting round five enter showdown.
During showdown, compare the value of each hand, and the highest hand value wins the pot.

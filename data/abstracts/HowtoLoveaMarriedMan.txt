All relationships are based on the following concepts:


Desire:This is when a person observes (visual) a person's actions and or appearance creating an image of interest.
In relationships, there are different depths of desire, attraction, and love.
A married man who is involved with another woman, sexually, emotionally, or in any way not in accordance with their marriage vows, is in fact 'not married' (emotionally).
There is also a real possibility that we all (both men and women) can love more than one person in a deep way at the same time.
Be prepared for "THE CHALLENGE".
Above all, be discrete.
Define the terms of the affair from the outset.
Keep feelings of jealousy in check.
Don't be a home wrecker.

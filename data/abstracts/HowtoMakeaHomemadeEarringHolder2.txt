Find a wooden frame and take out the backing and glass panel.
Paint the frame and let it dry.
Consider decorating the frame further, especially if it is a plain frame.
Use a marker to trace the glass panel onto a sheet of plastic canvas.
Cut the plastic canvas/mesh out.
Glue the mesh to the back of your frame.Flip your frame over so that the back is facing you.
Cut a piece of ribbon.
Make a loop from the ribbon, then glue it to the back of your frame.
Wait for the glue to dry, then hang your earring holder.

Consult an OB/GYN, a physician or healthcare provider for individual recommendations about airline travel during pregnancy.Many healthcare professionals allow pregnant women to fly for the majority of their pregnancy, provided there are no known complications with the pregnancy, such as a ruptured placenta, gestational diabetes, or hypertension.Women who have previously experienced a miscarriage, premature delivery, fetal loss, stillbirth, or any of a number of other health risks may not receive approval from an obstetrician or midwife for travel by plane for any occasion during pregnancy, for fear that the current pregnancy is also high-risk.Certain conditions during pregnancy may be aggravated by plane travel, and flying has an unknown effect on many other conditions, making many medical experts cautious of endorsing travel by plane for women experiencing high-risk pregnancies.
Inform the airline about your pregnancy.
Ask the airline about their restrictions.
Be honest with the airline and your doctor.

Find a standard Ethernet cable you don't use for anything.
Towards one end of the cable, cut open a slit a few inches long.
Peel back and remove the cable casing.
Cut the green, orange, white-green and the white-orange.
With the wires cut, work now one-by-one.
On Side "A" we will call it, connect the green stripped end to the orange stripped end on Side "B".
You now have one step of your crossover wire completed.
Just as we connected the orange and green wires for one side of our crossover cable, lets now repeat the process with the final two wires.
On Side "A", join the green-white wire to the orange-white wire on Side "B".
Join the remaining wires.
Clean the cable up.
Admire your new, home made crossover cable!

Avoid starting every sentence with “I.” Though you are writing from the perspective of the “I” in the first person point of view, you do not want every sentence to begin with “I.” Doing this can make the narrative feel repetitive and stilted.
Do not report on the action using the “I.” Allow the first person narrator to describe a scene or moment from their point of view.
Try not to place distance between the reader and the “I.” Using “I thought,” “I saw,” or “I felt” in the narrative can create distance between the reader and the first person perspective.

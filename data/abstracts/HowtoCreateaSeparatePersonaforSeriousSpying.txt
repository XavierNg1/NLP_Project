Describe yourself.
Disregard all that.
If you're not finding anything, take a stereotype and bend it a little.
Find a name for your persona.
Go shopping in your persona.
Practice being in your persona.
Hide the stuff for your persona when you're not using it.
When you want to go out as your persona, sneak the clothes/makeup/wig out in an opaque bag.
If someone you know sees you, don't react.
Try not to let pieces of your persona leak through into your current personality.

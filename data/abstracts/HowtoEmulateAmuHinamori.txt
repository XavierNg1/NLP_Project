Figure out which ego you want to be like of Amu`s.
Now that you have chosen the Ego and personality you want to have you need to act the part.
Start to dress the part which you have chosen.
Practice the talents that she/they have.
Think about what your actions have been over the day, just like Amu is found to do in the show.
Think about what Amu has in her room to reflect her personality.
Amu has a crush on a boy in the same grade as her that lots of girls like but she acts as if she's not interested in him until he figures out that she has charas.
Take time for yourself and hang out with your friends.
Be yourself and enjoy life.

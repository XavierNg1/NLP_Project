Purchase some wood that will give you the right look for your space.
Store the wood in the space you will be installing at least 2 weeks prior to actually starting the install.
Remove the old floor down to the sub-floor.
Start by snapping a chalk line across your sub floor.
Begin with the longest, most straight wall; using the longest, most straight floor boards you have.
(Option 1) Face nail (using finish nails) then angle nail the first few rows of boards you install.
Racking the boards gives the chance to eliminate imperfect pieces and helps stagger board ends.
When there is enough space to begin using the floor nail gun, space nails 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm) apart (2-5 nails per board).
Check your work as you continue, use a square if you have a good reference point.
Use a jamb saw to undercut trim pieces.

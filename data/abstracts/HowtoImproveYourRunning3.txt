Use a diverse, active warm up to cut time off of any run or race.
Use your light run to work up a light sweat.
Gradually add high knees, butt kicks, and shuffling into your warm-up run.
Activate your hips before you start with lunges, hip openers, and skips.
Use static stretching lightly, prioritizing it after a workout instead of before.
Hydrate throughout the day, as well as right before you start.

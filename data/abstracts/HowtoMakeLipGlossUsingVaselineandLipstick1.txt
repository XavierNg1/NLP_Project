Place a spoonful of Vaseline into a plastic, zippered bag.
Cut off a small amount of lipstick, and add it into the bag.
Close the bag, then massage the Vaseline and lipstick together.
Snip off the bottom corner of the bag, then squeeze the lip gloss into a small container.You can use just about anything for your lip gloss container, including old lip gloss containers.
Give the lip gloss a final stir with a toothpick, if needed, then put the lid onto the container.

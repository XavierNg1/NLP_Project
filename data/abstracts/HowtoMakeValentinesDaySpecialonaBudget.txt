Avoid equating love with consumption.
Minimize rather than do without.
Make your own.
Think of something you can do for your love.
Exchange cheesy but sweet gifts that remind you of one another, for whatever reason.
Give time.
Create a special evening at home together.
Stargaze.
Be spontaneous.
Take a walk down memory lane together.
Say "I love you".

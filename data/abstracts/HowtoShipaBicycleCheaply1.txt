Finding a box: Locate a proper cardboard bicycle box.
Calculating the cost: Measure the length, height and depth of your box.
Bicycles can also be shipped from Amtrak Express which delivers them from station to station.
Trimming the box (if needed): Cut two or three inch slots into the four corners of the open end of the box (between the flaps).
Test fit: It's best to conduct a few test fits.
Finished.

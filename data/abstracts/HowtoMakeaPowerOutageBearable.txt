Consider the type of emergencies your particular home is most likely to face.
Cook perishable foods.
Have stable foods that don't require refrigeration.
Have a back-up method of heating food and water.
Have a back-up method for heating or cooling your home during a blackout, depending on your climate's needs.
Prepare by equipping your house with automatic power failure safety lighting so that it does not go dark when the power goes out.
Power outages can mean 'get out of the house' during the day if it is safe to do so.
If you can afford it, get a powerful Portable Power Outlet like ATOM or a Portable Power Generator.
Remember that there will be no TV, no light, and games that need reading will not be able to be played.
Keep a battery powered camping "lantern" available.
Keep a battery powered radio available to monitor local news and emergency developments.

List the x and y coordinates of all the vertices.
Multiply the x coordinate of each point by the y coordinate of the next point.
Multiply the y coordinates of each point by the x coordinates of the next point.
Subtract the sum of the second group of coordinates from the sum of the first group of coordinates.
Divide this difference by two.

Since most Direct TV (DTV) DVRs and TiVOs have dual tuners, consider running two cables instead of just one.
Install a ground block in a convenient location anywhere between the dish and prior to entering the home.
Install a #10 copper wire between the house ground point (ground rod, electric meter, etc.),
Run coax cables from each of the dish's output terminals into one side of the ground block.
,
Run a cable from any rooftop UHF/VHF/FM antenna (if desired) to the same side of the ground block as the dish coax.

,
Run the same number of cables that were run into the ground block, between the ground block and a central location.
Run cables from each tuner to the central location.
Select a multiswitch by determining how many inputs and outputs are needed.
Multiswitches become more expensive as the number of inputs and outputs increase.
Mount the multiswitch(es) and connect the dish coax cables to the dish input connector, and the antenna or Cable TV coax to the antenna input connector.
At the receiver end, connect coax cables(s) to each tuner input(s).
Check picture quality at each location.
Securely tighten the coax connectors along each cable where ever they appear with a wrench, starting at the TV, receiver, multiswitch and ending at the ground block or dish.

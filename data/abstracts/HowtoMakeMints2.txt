Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper and set them aside.
Beat the butter until it is creamy.
Mix in the sugar, heavy cream, and mint extract using a low-speed setting.
Lightly dust your work surface with confectioners' sugar.
Turn the sugar mixture onto the dusted surface and knead it until it is smooth and silky.
Roll out a small amount of the dough into a thin rope.
Cut the rope into smaller pieces.
Place the cut mints onto the baking sheet.
Keep rolling and cutting the dough until you have nothing left.
Let the mints dry for 1 to 2 days, then store them in the fridge in an airtight container.It might also be a good idea to store them in between layers of parchment paper.

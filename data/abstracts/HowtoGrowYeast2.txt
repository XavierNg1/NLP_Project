Work in a clean area.
Clean and sanitize a surface.
Purchase equipment.
Sterilize suitable containers.
Let the containers cool, then run them through a flame.

Boil 1 cup (240 mL) water and 1/4 cup (60 mL) dried malt extract.
Turn down heat and stir in 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) agar powder until dissolved.
Bring to boil again.
Remove from heat.
Fill each container with a small layer of the mixture.
Cover the containers and wait.
Sterilize the inoculation loop.
Draw the loop lightly over the liquid yeast sediment.
Add the yeast to the surface of the wort, following this step carefully.
Repeat the sterilization before adding yeast to each container.
Check on the yeast cultures for the next few days.
Move successful cultures to the fridge.

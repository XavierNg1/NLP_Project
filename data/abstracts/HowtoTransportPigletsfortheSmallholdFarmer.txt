Provide the right type of transportation.
Provide a large cage for each piglet.
Travel in the cool of the day.
Prior to travel, only allow the piglet to drink but not to eat.
On arrival at your piglet's new home, keep it confined to a small, comfortable area first so that it can acclimatize to the smells, the noises, the different people and animals around it.

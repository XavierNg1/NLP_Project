Start by combing through your hair.
Next, a separate 1/16 piece from your hair and tie up the rest.

From there take two bobby pins.
Take the next bobby pin and open it.
Untie the rest of the hair from before and repeat steps 2-4 until all hairs have been twisted up.
Now untie/release the hair from the first curl, then move on to the second, third, fourth, etc.
Finish.

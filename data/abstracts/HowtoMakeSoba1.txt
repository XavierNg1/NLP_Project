Purchase the right buckwheat for soba noodles -- not all of them are created equally.
Weigh out your flours, whenever possible, and mix in a large bowl.
Sift the flour to remove any lumps.
Add the warm water slowly, blending into the dough with your fingers.
Knead until you have a crumbly, loose dough, adjusting as needed.
Knead the dough on a floured counter until smooth, about 5-7 minutes.
Mold the dough into a flat-bottomed peak.
Press the peak straight down with your palm to form a 1/2" (1.3cm) dough disc.
Dust your rolling surface and rolling pin with more flour.
Roll the dough, starting from the center and working out, into a thin rectangle.
Sprinkle flour over half of the dough.
Fold the unfloured dough half on top of the floured half.
Flour the bottom half of the dough and fold it over two more times.
Slice the dough vertically with even, methodical cuts.
Immediately toss the noodles with a pinch more flour.
Cook the noodles that day or freeze for three months.

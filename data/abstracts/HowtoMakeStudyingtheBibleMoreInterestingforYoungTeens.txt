Start off with a quick game.
After the game, move the group to a relaxed, comfortable setting.
Provide snacks or food.
Pick an interesting, short Bible passage.
Analyze the passage as a group.
Relate the meaning of the passage to the life of a teenager, for instance choose "just one" of these: white lies, lying versus joking, word tricks and twisting words of others (use each one for another lesson/session).
Ask open ended questions.
Avoid "yes/no" questions, except when they are voting on the meaning or you're taking a poll.

,
Go around the group before praying at the end of class: Have everyone say one thing that they want to pray for -- also, about any answered prayer (testifying, similar to in court).

,
Keep a record by writing these prayer requests and results down.

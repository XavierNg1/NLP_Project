Undergo shoulder reduction.This is when a doctor does some pulling and tugging maneuvers to strategically re-align your shoulder joint.
Immobilize your shoulder.After your shoulder has been re-aligned, it will need to be immobilized for the first part of the healing period (generally three to four weeks).
Exercise your shoulder.
Take pain medications as needed.Since a dislocated shoulder can be quite a painful injury, you will likely need pain medications as you recover.
Ice your shoulder.Another strategy to help with recovery after a shoulder dislocation is icing the area.
Use surgery as a last resort.For severe and/or repeated shoulder dislocations, surgery may be used as a last resort treatment.

Regardless of whether you are 5 or 25, don't wear inappropriate costumes.
Behave as you go from house to house.
At the door, look for a doorbell.
When they open the door, say "trick-or-treat" in a peppy voice.
Go to a house once and only once.
If the outside lights or their decorations are off, do not go to that house.
No egging or TPing!

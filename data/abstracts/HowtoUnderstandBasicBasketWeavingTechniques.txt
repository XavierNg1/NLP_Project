Start by understanding some basic terms:



Weaver - these are the basket strands that weave through the spokes; they are lighter, thinner and more flexible than the spokes, to enable them to be woven in and out;

Spoke - these are the strands that stand upright and form the side supports of the basket; they are much stiffer than the weavers and are strong.
Be familiar with under-and-over-weaving.
Note that double weaving is the same form but two weavers are used at once.
Note that pairing may be used with an odd or even number of spokes.
Identify the triple twist.

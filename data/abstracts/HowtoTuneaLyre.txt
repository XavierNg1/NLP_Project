Establish the basic key of your lyre.
Now, pick a tuning appropriate to your needs, but transposed (if necessary) to the key of your lyre.
If you have a modern metal zither pegs, simply turn them with a peg-key to tighten.
To hit the notes of the tuning you've selected, a beginner will probably want to use an online tuner, or a store-bought chromatic tuner or tuner app on a smartphone.
Understand that most tuners are set up to tune by "Equal Temperament", the modern way of tuning where an instrument will sound good in any key, but not quite perfect in any of them.

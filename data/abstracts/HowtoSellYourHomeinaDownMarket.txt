De-personalize: Take all family photos down from walls, remove kids' artwork, and pack away lawn ornaments.
De-clutter: The potential buyer should be able to see your home's best selling points without interference from a clutter of miscellaneous objects.
Clean: Wash everything from ceiling fans to base boards.
Neutralize: Tone down overly ornate d√©cor or loud wall colors.
Designate rooms: Make sure rooms distinctly show what they are.
Increase curb appeal: It's important that your house stand out.
Price it right the first time: The longer you have your house on the market, the more value it can lose.
Maintain a good working relationship with your agent: It's critical that the lines of communication remain open.
Consider offering an incentive: Paying for a year of Home Owner's Association fees or a portion of the closing costs offer real value without lowering the asking price.
Use a professional home stager: It will cost you a little money, but it is a worthwhile investment.

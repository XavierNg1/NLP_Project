Imagine the shape of this polyhedral ornament as if it were a planet.

Cut off the top and bottom parts of the plastic soda bottle.
,

Use the center "tube" of the bottle to cut the rings from.

Start at one end of the center tube.

Join the red tape circle at the tube's join line.

Take the next color (in this example, blue) and proceed to stick it around the tube as before but don't tape it down completely.

Repeat using the next 4 colors, placed equally along the tube.

Carefully cut out each colored ring.

Repeat until all 5 colored rings have been cut into individual rings, as well as the red equator ring.
Create the "South Pole" or Antarctic design.

Weave in the equator circle (the red piece).
Make the North Pole or Arctic pentagon.





Tape the ends together as shown, then glue into place to strengthen and maintain the desired shape.

Use the ornament decoratively.

Choose the skateboard you want.
Plan when to talk to them.Let them know in advance of asking for the skateboard that you’d like to ask them for help with something.
Ask with gratitude.Instead of asking directly, “Can I have a skateboard?” frame your question in terms that show you know you’re asking for a favor.
Be persuasive.Make a PowerPoint or a poster showing the type of skateboard you want and information about the advantages of having a skateboard.
Show appreciation.After your parents get you the skateboard, show them you appreciate them by giving them big hugs and a peck on the cheek.
Don’t respond with anger if you don’t get it.Sometimes your parents can act unreasonable or unfair.

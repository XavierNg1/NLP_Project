For a very dirty kitten, give her a bath.
Run the tap water to adjust the temperature of the water.
Shallowly fill a basin or sink with warm water.
Use shampoo by squeezing a small amount on a cloth and rubbing it into her coat.
Rinse her off completely.
Use as little water as possible.
Finish quickly and wrap her when you're done.

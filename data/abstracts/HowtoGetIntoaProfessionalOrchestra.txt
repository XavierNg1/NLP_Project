Be very committed to your instrument and to music.
All professional orchestras hold an audition process.
Make sure you are familiar with the audition process.
Get the necessary repertoire, scales, and excerpts you need to learn as soon as you can.
Get a good night's sleep the day before the audition.
Walk into the room confidently and play to your best ability.
If there is an interview, answer all questions to the best of your knowledge.

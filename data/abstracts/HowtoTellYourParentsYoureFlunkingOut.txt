Help around the house.
Be nicer to them, so they can see that you're at least trying to be different.
Sit your parents down to have a serious talk.
You'll have to listen a lot, too.
Once they're done, start off by saying, "Mom, Dad, I get what you're saying and I agree...." If, at that last word, they faint, or ask you whether you're high, don't give up.
Tell them you understand their concerns about your career and future.
Mention to them how you regret not having paid attention in class before.
Tell them, at the end of your talk ,that you got your grades, and they were really no good....Tell them you sincerely see your mistake in letting your grades slip down, and that you'll work on it.

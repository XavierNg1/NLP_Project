Maximize the light from existing windows.
Use white or light colors throughout the room to reflect natural light that comes in.
Mirrors across from a window will reflect the light into different parts of the room.
Change a solid exterior door for one with windows.
Install a new or expanded window.
Sliding glass doors are a wonderful way to open up a room with light if you have a nice view (yard, scenery, deck or patio) to look out on.
Consider installing a tubular skylight.

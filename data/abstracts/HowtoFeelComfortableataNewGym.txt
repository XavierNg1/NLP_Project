Jump in there!,
If you have a tendency to back out of these types of appointments or situations, have a gym employee make a note that you need to receive a reminder call the day before your scheduled time slot.
Join a class.
On the first day of your class, arrive about ten minutes early.
Take a position in the front of the class so you can be sure to hear the instructor and so you can watch the movements closely.
Go to the gym at the same time every day.

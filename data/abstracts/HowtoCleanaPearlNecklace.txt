Find a very soft cloth.
Wipe pearl jewelry gently before putting your pearl necklace away each time, to remove body oils and perspiration.
For every fifth wash of the pearls, they'll need something a little stronger than simply a dampened cloth.
If the clasp has to be cleaned as well, use a Q tip (cotton bud) dipped in either jewelry cleaner (make sure it is compatible with the metal of the clasp) or if it a hard metal (not gold) without gemstones, you can use a bit of toothpaste.
Finished.

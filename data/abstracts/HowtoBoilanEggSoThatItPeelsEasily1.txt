Place your eggs in a single layer in a saucepan.
Cover the eggs with 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of cold water.How much water you end up using will depend on how big the saucepan is and how many eggs you are cooking.
Bring the water to a boil over high heat.
Turn the stove off, cover the saucepan with a lid, and wait 11 to 13 minutes.
Prepare an ice bath.
Carefully transfer the eggs to the ice bath and wait 5 to 15 minutes.
Pull the eggs out of the water and set them down someplace where they won't roll away.
Crack the shell first, but don't peel it.
Carefully peel the shell away from the egg.
Dry the eggs off with a paper towel.
Bon Appetit!

Crouch down on the floor.
Put out the leg you're going to use as your "helicopter blade.",
Lift up the hand on the same side of your "helicopter blade" leg as you swing that leg past it.
Plant the lifted hand back on the ground and lift your other hand as your "helicopter blade" leg swings past it.
Jump over your "helicopter blade" leg with your other leg as the "blade" leg swings past it.
Swing your "helicopter blade" leg all the way around to where you started, and keep swinging it around until you run out of steam.
Keep practicing.

If the car runs, then stand on the side of the car where the pulleys are and try to distinguish where the noise is coming from.
If the car doesn't run and you are going to be the one doing the work, then remove your front accessories enough to get to the front cover.
With the cover off, check for the free movement of all the idler pulleys and the tension itself.
While you are in there, it is smart to just get a timing belt kit and replace all the pulleys and the belt.

Make sure that you line up all your marks and set the proper tension on the belt.

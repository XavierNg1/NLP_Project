Bring 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water to a simmer in a saucepan.
Stir in 1 tablespoon of sea salt.
Add the coconut oil and stir with a spoon until it has melted.
Remove the saucepan from heat, and let the mixture cool before adding 4 to 5 drops of your favorite essential oil.
Pour the mixture into a spray bottle.
Close the bottle, and shake it before you use it.

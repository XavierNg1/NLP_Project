Modify your expectations.
Prepare a “Plan B.” One of the biggest sources of frustration in dealing with a flaky friend is the fact that you’re always getting “stuck”: stuck waiting at the restaurant, stuck without a ride home, stuck not knowing if the ski trip is really going to happen or not.
Try to understand the problem.
Don’t “bend over backwards.” When it comes to unreliable friends, sometimes the truth is as simple as this: “People are flaky because they can be.”That is, your friend may keep blowing you off because she experiences no consequences for doing so, and thus senses no reason to change.

Choose skin-toned tights and stockings with care.
Match your tights or stockings to the hemline of your skirt or dress.
Consider matching your tights or stockings to your shoes instead.
Choose something sheer that matches your skin tone if your shoes and skirt/dress are both bright colors.Remember, not everything that is labeled "nude," "skin tone," or "buff" will match your legs.
Avoid wearing white tights, especially with black shoes.

There are many headsets official and unofficial which are usable with the Xbox 360.
If you have a wireless headset or earpiece you will need to charge it fully first.
Now on to the connection of the headset.
For a wired headset plug the 2.5mm pin into the bottom of the controller listening for a small click.
For a wireless headset, once fully charged you will need to sync it.
Most of the time new headsets won't be set to mute but if you cannot hear any sound make sure this is the case.
To test if you have connected it right press the home button on your controller to bring up the box.

Fill a container with two cups of hot water.For the best effect, choose a clear glass, bowl, or bottle.
Put on rubber or latex gloves and remove the felt ink tube from a yellow highlighter.Pry off the bottom of the highlighter; you may want to use a knife or a pair of needle-nose pliers to get it open.
Place the ink tube in the glass of hot water and allow it to sit.
Turn on a blacklight and light up your bottles.

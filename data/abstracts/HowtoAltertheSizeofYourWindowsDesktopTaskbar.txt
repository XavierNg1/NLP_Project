To alter the size of your Windows desktop taskbar, make sure that the taskbar is not locked.
Once the taskbar is unlocked, position your mouse cursor directly over any vacant space on the taskbar, or on the top section that must be just appeared.
While the taskbar is unlocked, you can reposition the taskbar at the top, right or left edges of the screen.
At this stage, you may lock the taskbar again if you wish.
Your computer may sometimes automatically hide the taskbar from view.
Other settings that you can change using the taskbar Properties dialog box include grouping similar documents, keeping the taskbar on top of open windows and of course showing/hiding the QuickLaunch toolbar.
You can even customize the mini-icons which are shown in the notification area (the section of the taskbar at the right-hand end).
Now that you have finished, start using your computer to see whether or not what you have done to your taskbar suits you.

To start out, make sure that any and all debris is cleared away from the closet flange (the plastic or metal ring that surrounds the drain in the ground).
Get the toilet bowl and turn it upside down.
Turn the tank around and make sure that all the nuts and gaskets are in their proper place, especially check the tank to bowl gasket.
Hook up the water supply (this can be a braided hose, plastic closet supply, or a chrome closet supply).
Once these steps have been accomplished and there arenâ€™t any leaks detected, put the tank lid on top of the tank to protect the parts within it.

First off you need to train magic.
Okay, now that you've trained your magic to the level you want, try to get rich.
Items required:F2p: Wizard hat, Wizard robe, leather chaps, for they give no mage deduction, any staff, but air staff is recommended.
Picking up the loot: If you're on the regular spellbook use telegrab to collect the items.
Weakness problems: If you are facing a ranger at low levels, it shouldn't be too much trouble.
Last of all, you should always make sure your opponent is bound.

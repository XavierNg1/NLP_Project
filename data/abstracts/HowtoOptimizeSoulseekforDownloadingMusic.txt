You should see a field that says "Listening Port:", Slsk (short for Soulseek) selects a random port, but you can change it to any port you like.
This will open up a webbrowser.
If your computer is connected to a router chances are the incoming port needs to be forwarded to your computer.
If you have more than 1 computer connected to the router, you will need to assign the computer you are using Soulseek a static IP address.
Open up your router administration control and assign the listening port to be forwarded to the IP address your computer receives from the router.
Restart your Soulseek client if you have changed your listening port.

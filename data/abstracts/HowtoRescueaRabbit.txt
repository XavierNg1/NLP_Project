If you're planning on getting a rabbit, check the humane societies in your area.
Before you make the purchase, be absolutely sure you have the time and money to keep a rabbit.
Before you buy always check over the rabbit, if its fur is falling out in huge tufts (sometimes this is just shedding, but if it's not shedding season this may indicate a problem).
Get stuff for the rabbit.
Lastly, have fun with your new pet, make sure if you see any health problems to call a vet immediately.

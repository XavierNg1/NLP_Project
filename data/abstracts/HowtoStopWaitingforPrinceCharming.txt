Consider what is meant by Prince Charming.
Remember, you are not a princess--and frankly, that is a good thing.
Figure out who Prince Charming is to you.
Create your own joy and source of fulfillment.
Stop waiting around to be rescued.
Enjoy your friendships.
Look after your own resources and needs before all else.
Map out what you really want out of a relationship.
Have a good laugh about the whole Prince Charming thing.
Remember that Prince Charming comes.....after everything else.

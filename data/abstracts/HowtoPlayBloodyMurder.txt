Figure out who is "it" and sit in a circle.
Have the "King Caller" (you'll need to decide who the King Caller is too) say a random phrase.

,
As the person who is "it" lands on someone, he or she says a number and then counts to it.
The one who is "it" hides.
Everyone looks for the person who is "it.",
Make sure everyone runs to the designated "base"; they can make a chain if they'd like to.
If everyone makes it, the person who was "it" is "it" again.

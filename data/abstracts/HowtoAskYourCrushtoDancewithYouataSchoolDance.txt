The first rule is to never steal your crush when he's dancing with someone else.
Request a slow song that you know everyone likes.
Once you request a song, wait for the DJ to play it, then when it comes on, slowly walk to your crush.
Say, "Hey, Do you want to dance with me?",
To start dancing, just pace back and forth for a while.
There!

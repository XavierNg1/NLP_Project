Acetylcholinesterase is one type of various enzymes in the body of humans that has specific and unique function that is related to neutralizing the effect of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine by removing an acetyl group from its molecular structure.
The targeting of this enzyme by nerve gases is mediated by the process of enzymatic inhibition of this particular enzyme by organophosphorus related compounds that have characteristic chemical properties of being able to inhibit the catalytic function of this enzyme through a noncompetitive mechanism of inhibition that leads to irreversible binding of the nerve agent to the active site of this enzyme.

By doing so the normal function of the enzyme is interrupted.
The immediate clinical effect of this process of enzyme inhibition is the continuous contraction of the various muscles in the body.
The neurotransmitter acetylcholine is an amine derivative that has a quaternary ammonium group as part of its molecular structure.
By virtue of its polar and hydrophilic structure this compound is unable to penetrate the phospholipid bilayer of the cellular membrane.
This neurotransmitter is secreted by neurons into the neuromuscular junction based on a stimulus that the neurons receive.
This molecule functions physiologically at the neuromuscular junction by inducing the opening of sodium ion channels in muscle cells.
The most prominent clinical effect of this neurotransmitter is on the muscles of the digestive system.
Acetylcholine is the main neurotransmitter of the autonomic nervous system.
Enzymes inhibition is one main strategy that is used in chemical warfare as well as for other clinical processes such as for treating medical disorders.

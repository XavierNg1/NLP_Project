Install cement board first if you're dealing with just a subfloor.
The cement in mortar and grout is a serious chemical and you need proper safety gear.
Lay down some latex-modified thinset mortar onto the subfloor.
Press down the cement board onto the subfloor and attach with cement board screws.
Continue laying mortar and cement board onto the subfloor, staggering the end joints so that they don't line up.
Cut the cement board with a jigsaw or a carbide-tipped scoring tool.
Finish up by mudding and taping the joints of the cement board.
If you need to, clean the existing floor thoroughly with a non-toxic floor cleaner.
Decide where you want to start your tile.
Find the center of the room by snapping a chalk line in the center of the room widthwise and lengthwise.
Line up your boxes of tile and open each one.
Lay down tile cement or thinset mortar where your first section of tile will be.
Start laying the floor tiles in the middle of the room, lining them up with your chalk lines.
Put a grout spacer at each corner of your tiles.
Continue laying all but the tiles on the outer edges of your room.
Allow the tile adhesive to dry overnight, then remove the grout spacers, if necessary.
Mix your grout according to the directions on the package; usually grout is mixed with water in a 5 gallon (18.9Â L) bucket.
Use a masonry float to spread the grout into the spaces between the tiles, creating a smooth surface.
Remove the excess grout you get on the tiles with a sponge.
Seal the grout after it has set for 72 hours.

Make sure you look confident and smell good.
Pick someone you don't know who happens to be alone to engage in a conversation.
Once you have someone who you've become acquainted with, migrate together around the groups and be friendly when you approach.
If someone is recounting a story, wait until they pause, then vocally ask a question or comment on it.
When you're speaking to someone, be sure to be genuinely engaged in them, and not staring off in other directions.
Try to be as relatable as possible.

Decide which theme you want.
Consider designs to go with your theme once you've thought of it.
Clear some space in your design space if possible.
Think of themed clothing designs for the villagers to wear.
Try to find and use some furniture and other things supplied in the game that go with your town theme.
Try to change the flag and town-tune to fit with the theme, even grow themed flowers and trees that are not your native and cut down normal ones!

Start with the orthodox grip, then rotate your bottom hand so your fingers are fully under the bat when the flat side is facing downward.
Use the ‘O’ shaped grip for more power on cross-batted shots.
Know that batters often adopt this technique when using bats that are too heavy for them.If you find yourself having a hard time making solid contact on vertical swings, or often edging the ball behind to the keeper or slips, then you may need to try a lighter bat, which allows you to use a more orthodox grip.

Decide whether it's necessary to prune your lilies.
Deadhead any spent blooms from your lily throughout the growing season.
Wait until the foliage has died and withered away before pruning.
Replant your lily in a container (optional).
Prune the foliage to ground level.
Cut away any damaged or diseased foliage throughout the year.
After pruning, mulch the ground to help the bulbs survive winter.

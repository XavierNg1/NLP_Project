Determine which scents you want to mix into your incense, taking 1-2 tablespoons of each.
Keep track of how much of each scent you use, writing notes if you plan to make incense often.
Using a mortar and pestle, mix and grind all of your chosen scents together.
Let the powder sit for a few hours to help the scents blend.
Determine how much makko you need to add by taking a percentage of your dry ingredients.
Multiply the amount of spices by your desired makko percentage to know of much to add.
Set aside a small portion of your mixture.
Using a pipette or other dropper, slowly add warm distilled water to your incense and mix to a paste.
Knead the dough under your hand for several minutes.
Pinch off a 1-2 inch chunk of dough and roll it out into a long, skinny rectangle.
Place an uncoated incense stick on the dough, then roll the whole thing up so the dough coats the last 3/4s of the stick.
Place the sticks on a small board lined with wax paper to dry, rotating them once or twice a day.
After 4-5 days, when the dough holds its shape and is dry to the touch, you're ready to burn.

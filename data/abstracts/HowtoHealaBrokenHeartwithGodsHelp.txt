Remember: what's yours, no one can take away.
Let your pain be.
Pray your pain.
When you talk about it to other people, be aware of whom you talk about it with.
Heal your body: Breathe deeply, yoga, exercise, try to sleep or at least rest.
Even through your pain, and especially through it, try to be kind to others.
Be silent.
Remember the bright side of a heart-ache: it can help you build yourself as a new, improved person.

,
Help other people, volunteer.
Try to keep your environment clean, tidy and litÂ enough.

,
Keep taking care of how you look.
Remember: everything is merely forms of Him.
Love yourself.

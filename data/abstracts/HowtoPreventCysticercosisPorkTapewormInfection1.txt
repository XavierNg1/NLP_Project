Avoid eating meat.
Use caution in high-risk areas.In the U.S. the most common areas for cysticercosis infection are California, Arizona, and Texas.
Wash and peel your fruits and vegetables.Washing your produce thoroughly will remove Taenia solium larvae that cause cysticercosis.
Wash your hands frequently.The importance of washing your hands when trying to prevent fecal-oral contamination cannot be overstated.
Drink clean water.Because T. solium can be found in local water supplies, bottled or boiled water is the way to go when trying to avoid cysticercosis.If you boil water, let it boil for at least one minute before letting it cool to a drinkable temperature.

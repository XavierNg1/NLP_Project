Find things in common.
Be nice.
Flirt.
If he says a corny joke.
Find out if the guy likes you.
Talk to him!,
Meet his friends, but don't make it like that you like them better than him.
Try to hang out after school for homework, in the computer room, doing sports, or anything depending on his interests.
Tell him that you like him ahead of time so he could build up ways to create a relationship.

,
Don't wear too much makeup.
Trust in him!,
If he stares at you a lot, but then when you look at him, he looks away really fast, that could be a sign he likes you.
If you are near him and his friends, pay attention.
Don't stare at him all the time.

Consider why you want to breed gerbils.
Research split caging.
Make sure you have good homes lined up for all babies before you have a single litter.
Save up money.
Buy your gerbils from a breeder rather than from a pet store.
Know the gerbils' health history.
Introduce the gerbils using a split cage, which should be located in a quiet and calm area of the house where there is not a lot of traffic nor sudden loud noises.
Monitor and record the matings so you know when to expect the litter.
Keep the breeding tank very simple without the presence of wheels, or toys and should be one level only.
Mom's diet should be supplemented with extra protein while pregnant and nursing.
When the litter is born do not disturb the nest for the first week.
Handle your pups regularly and sex them.
Pups are weaned at 4 weeks but should stay with the mother until at least 6 weeks has passed.
Never sell pups to someone who doesn't have a suitable cage or tank for them, and don't sell a pup singly because it'll be lonely, or any of different sexes.

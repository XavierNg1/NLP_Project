Frost your cake right before you roll the fondant and cover the cake.
Measure the width of the cake.
Open a package of fondant in the color of your choosing.
Knead the fondant for three to five minutes.

Decorate the top of the cake with writing, piping or edible pieces of colored fondant cut into shapes.

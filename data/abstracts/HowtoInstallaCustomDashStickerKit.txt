Search the Internet to purchase the dash sticker kit of your choice.
Clean all surfaces of your dashboard thoroughly with isopropyl alcohol and a clean towel to facilitate adhesion.
Lay each finished piece over the area it will cover, with the backing still attached, so that you can ensure that all pieces fit and you know where they go before you begin.
Remove the backing to each dash sticker, and carefully apply them to the dashboard 1 at a time.Press each finish piece 1 more time after you finish applying them to make sure all edges and corners are in place.Leave the dash stickers alone to set for 72 hours without touching them.

Fill a tall glass with 1 cup (240 milliliters) of cold or room temperature water.
Add 1 green tea bag, or the equivalent of loose-leaf tea.
Cover the cup or pitcher, and put it into the refrigerator for 4 to 6 hoursThis will give the tea enough time to brew and infuse the water with its delicate flavor.
Fill a tall glass with ice.
Take the tea bags out.
Pour the chilled tea into the ice-filled glass.
Sweeten the tea with honey, if desired, and serve.

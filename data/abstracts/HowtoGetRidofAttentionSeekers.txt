Don't give the attention seekers the attention.
Begin distancing yourself from such persons and their parades.
Beware deliberate attempts to undermine you when it becomes clear you're no longer going to be supportive.
Ignore continued lies and tell people the truth.
Let others take care of the drama.
Find forgiveness.

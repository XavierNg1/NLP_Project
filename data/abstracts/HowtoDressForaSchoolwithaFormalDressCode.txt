When you start school, or at the start of a new semester/term, follow these steps to ensure you have all the right clothes and can make enough outfits.
The most important thing to do is keep your head up.
Throw open your wardrobe doors and look at your clothes with an open mind.
Get a parent to look at your decisions.
Look at the 'Things you'll need' list at the bottom of this page.
Once you have acquired your clothes and have a plentiful smart wardrobe, you can identify missing pieces by thinking up outfits.
Make sure that all your smart clothes make multiple outfits with your other smart clothes.
Now look at the dress code.
As school progresses, try adding your favourite items from the home clothes section of your wardrobe to your smart outfits.

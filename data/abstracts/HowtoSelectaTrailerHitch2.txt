Two of the most important factors in selecting a trailer hitch are Gross Trailer Weight (GTW) and Tongue Weight (TW).
Weigh your gross towing weight

The Tongue Weight (TW) is the downward force exerted by the trailer coupler onto the hitch ball and the trailer hitch.
Weigh the trailer tongue weight

For tongue weights over 300 pounds, place a household scale and a brick that's as thick as the scale three feet apart as shown the figure below.

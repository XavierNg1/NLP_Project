Know your audience – it makes the experience easier.
If you have been asked to speak on a particular subject, for example “The Roman Gladiator” it is essential to know whether the people you will be lecturing to are novices in the subject, or experts.
The tone of your speech will also differ for small groups.
Sometimes it is not always possible to find out all this information before the lecture so you need to try to be adaptable.
Research – The better prepared you are for your speech or lecture, the better the speech will be.
Be aware than any holes in your research will be noticed and questioned by someone in the audience, so to prevent any awkward moments make sure there are no holes, sweeping statements or uncertainties.
If you think ”I hope no one asks me ……” you can guarantee someone will, so have an answer.
Timing – You will be given a time for your speech, sometimes these are flexible (between 10-15 minutes for example) which is good, as going over time is bad manners.
Use the premise that 2000 words will last approximately 10 minutes talking time.
Practice the speech at home, and time it.

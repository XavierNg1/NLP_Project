Try to be in some of the same places.
Interact with her.
Be bold.
Make her laugh.
Treat her like a lady.
Be valuable to her.
Splash around the praise.
Lend her your gear and borrow hers.
Laugh at her jokes.
Always be there for her.
Let your other friends know she's your friend, period.
Stay open about your feelings.

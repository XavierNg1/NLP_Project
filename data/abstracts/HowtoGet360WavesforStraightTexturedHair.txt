Cutting The Hair: You want your hair length to be pretty long regarding buzz cuts, around 16mm to 20mm.
Cutting Waves In: After your hair is chopped 16mm to 20mm, who ever is cutting your hair is going to need a hair trimmer.
Laying Hair Down: You want to keep your hair laid down at all times, because if not, the waves will still appear... but will look funny, and nothing even close to what the original 360 waves look liked.
Shape Up: This is more off an optional step, but getting a shape-up is going to suit the hairstyle more than an uneven hairline, and edges.

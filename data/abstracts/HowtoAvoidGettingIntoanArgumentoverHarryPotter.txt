Ask the other person why he or she has not read the books or doesn't like them.
If they just don't like them, perhaps because they find them boring, or maybe because they don't like all the Mary Sue type characters in the book (ex: Harry Potter, Dumbledore) or maybe they prefer other genres less focused on action, leave it at that.
Explain to people who say the Harry Potter books are promoting satanism/witchcraft that they are all in good fun.
Do not advertise your appreciation of Harry Potter if you run in many Christian/conservative circles.
Don't assume that all Christian/religious people would love to see Harry Potter burnt at the stake.
Ask people who had only watched the movies why they never read the books.
Keep your cool.

Find and purchase a healthy one year old bare rooted apple tree which has only a single stem and no other shoots.
Choose the location in your garden where you would like to have your apple tree espalier.
Begin in winter by planting the young apple tree.
Once you are confident that the winter's frost has passed you can begin to prune.
First tier growth.
Second Tier growth.
Subsequent tier growth.
When the leading shoot reaches the top climbing wire remove the tip (during early summer) so the leading shoot is below the top tier climbing wire.
Now your apple tree should have filled out considerably and you will formed an espalier of your first apple tree.

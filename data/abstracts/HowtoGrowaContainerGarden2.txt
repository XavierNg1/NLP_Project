Buy plants from a nursery that will do well in containers and the amount of sunlight you get.
Choose a large planter with a drain hole at the bottom.
Line the bottom of the planter with a porous material, such as a coffee filter, burlap, or window screen.
Add the plants, and arrange them to your liking.
Fill the gaps between the flowers with potting soil.
Water the soil until water starts to drain out of the bottom of the planter.
Take care of your plants.

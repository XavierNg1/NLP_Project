Stay alert at all times.
Determine whether you are precisely being followed.
Use positive self talk.
Quickly assess the situation to see if it's possible to get yourself out of harm's way.
If the previous step isn't going to prove possible, you'll need to find other fast solutions.
Take action.
Continue yelling.
Run or get away.
If you have a cell phone, call the police at the same time as continuing to walk to somewhere safe.
Take your keys out of your purse or pocket.
If you've done everything and the person is still following you, it probably means that the person plans on harming you.
Don't go straight home.

Eat and drink!,
Change your clothes and go to the synagogue.
Seeing as it is a High Holiday, follow the same regulations as Shabbat, which means no TV, cell phone and regular phone, computer, usage of electricity, etc.
During the actual day, you will be in the synagogue, going home for rests between the prayers.
Once the last prayer is said and the fast is over, you are free to go home and revive yourself hoping that your year will be as sweet as honey.

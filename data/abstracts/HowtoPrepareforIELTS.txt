Try to find out your weak points and start working on them (e.g.if you are not so strong in the writing section then you should start with this and eventually you will like it), or if you have difficulties in the speaking section then start to talk and think in English, as there is no better way to learn speaking.
Start reading newspapers, journals and articles and you should be well informed about the current issues used for the speaking and writing topics.You can discuss those issues with your friends in English as that'll help you to prepare better for both sections-3.

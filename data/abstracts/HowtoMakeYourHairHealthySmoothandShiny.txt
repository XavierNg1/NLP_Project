Comb or brush your hair carefully.
Use hair serum from any product brands.
After a shower, never rub your hair with a towel, it will cause breakage and damage to the wet hair shaft.
If you desire to really maximize the healthiness of your hair, use coconut milk on your hair.
For better results, leave the oil in your hair overnight and shampoo the next morning for deep conditioning.
Go to a hairdresser for a trim every 6-12weeks, especially for longer hair prone to breakage.

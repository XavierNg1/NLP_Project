Don't try to explore deeply before you have a good home base set up near the soon-to-be-mine.
Spend a few game days preparing.
Go select a good cave to start mining once you have enough materials.
Build a shelter of cobblestone completely covering the entrance to your mine.
Return home.
Enter your mine.
Craft a few yellow (or your choice) carpets.
As soon as you collect 8 iron ore and some coal, go back to your shelter and smelt it.
If you come to the end of a tunnel, congratulations.
When you break your tools, you can drop your crafting table and make some more on the fly (make sure to pick it back up), or you can return to your shelter.
When you've gone deep enough in your mine that returning to your shelter is inconvenient, just build another one complete with crafting table, bed, water source, and all.
When you start to run low on wood or wool, you'll be returning home.

Recycle and reuse where possible.
Make your own pencil cases, laptop cases, backpacks, etc. using materials already available at home.
Decorate plain (but less expensive) supplies for a personalized touch.
If uniforms are required, use the school's used uniform distribution system.
Textbooks can be very expensive, so search for second-hand.

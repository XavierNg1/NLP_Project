Locate a pair of chopsticks.
Brush your hair.
Hold the chopsticks together in your hand, pointy end down.
Wrap your hair around the sticks a few times.
Take the top ends of the sticks and pull them down, then push the skinny end into the back of the wrap you just made.
Make sure the bun is secure.
Add finishing touches (optional) and your hairstyle is complete!.

Remove green beans from the freezer.
Pat the green beans dry with a paper towel.
In a small bowl, mix a cup of beer, a cup of flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
Pour a few inches of cooking oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
Place the batter in a large food storage bag.
Use a pair of tongs to transfer the battered green beans to the hot oil.
Cook the beans until they are golden brown and crispy.

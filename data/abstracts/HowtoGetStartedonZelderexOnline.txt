The first time you start an account on ZeldereX, you will be required to start and finish the tutorial.
Realize that upon completing the tutorial some players still find themselves lacking direction, that is where this guide comes in.

,
You start off with around $300,000, however this quickly depletes.
The first thing you should set at doing is upgrading your Trithium Refinery to level 10, this will take awhile but not too long.
Once you have upgraded the Trithium Refinery to level 10, you can take your focus off of it and onto defense.
Click the Build link and begin building an Aircraft Factory, a Land Factory and Hovercraft Factory.
Your Air Factory, Land Factory and Hovercraft Factory should now be through being built.
By now you should be fairly established as a functioning base, however money still run short so For now i will leave it up to you to update your Trithium Refinery periodically.

,
You will also need to update your Solar Generator when needed(Do not waste money on updating your Solar Generator UNLESS it is ABSOLUTELY needed!!!,
We should now focus on a bit more research, such as the following: Fuel Storage, Banisher, Colonization, Intelligence.
Start attacking other player's bases.
If you have researched Colonization, you can start colonizing other bases, but it would be best to wait until you are stockpiling hordes of cash before doing so, as new bases need to be upgraded just like your home base was, and this takes even more cash as you will be upgrading the new base and maintaining the home base as well.

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.
Warm the 8-oz package cream cheese up to room temperature.
In a large mixing bowl, melt 1 tablespoon butter and add the 3/4 cup buffalo wing sauce.
Stir in 2 cups of shredded chicken and toss to coat.
Add the package of cream cheese, 1/4 cup bleu cheese, 1/2 cup of shredded cheese, and stir.
Spread the mixture evenly into an oven safe baking dish, then top with the rest of the shredded cheese.
Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the top is gold-brown and bubbling.
Remove from oven and serve after cooling.

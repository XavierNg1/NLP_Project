Tell your dog to get "down" if they jump on others.
Teach your dog the “sit and stay” command.
Get your dog to “go to their place.” The command “go to place” can also be good to teach your dog if you want them to go to a designated spot outside to calm down.
Make sure your dog understands the "come" command.

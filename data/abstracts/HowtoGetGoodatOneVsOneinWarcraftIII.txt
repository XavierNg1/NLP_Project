Play.
Watch replays.
You should probably know that by now, but scout, counter, creep, etc...

,
Play with your friends (if any of them plays War3), try to beat them and counter their strategies, if you beat them, they will probably come out with a new strategies, and then you can counter that strategies too, it's good practice, you can find anything out there (on Battle-net =P).

,
You may find the pros rushing or people saying that rushing is good.
Don't get a hero to level 2 and think you creeped enough, keep creeping all the time unless you're rushing or defending your base.

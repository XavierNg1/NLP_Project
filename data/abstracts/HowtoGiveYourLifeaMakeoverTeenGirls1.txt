Since your closet is one of the main things in your room, you need to make sure it is always kept clean.
Next it's time to clean your desk/working space.
Re-make your bed.
If you have shelves or a nightstand, organise them the way you did with your closet: throw away, give away, sell and keep.
Finally, wipe any surfaces you have, they might be dusty!

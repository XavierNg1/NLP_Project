Pull the chain off the crochet needle.
Hold the chain in your left hand and the needle in your right hand.
Stick the tip of the needle into the third bump of the crochet chain.
Drape the ball end of the yarn over the tip of the needle.
Use the needle to pull the yarn through the bump.Try pointing the tip of the needle upward as you pull it through the bump.
Repeat the steps until you have cast on the number of stitches that the pattern requires.

First of all, assess your task.
If you have a large space, it's good to map it out and tackle each part in sections.
Get together any supplies you need while you clean.
Plan out your time.
Take a deep breath.
Turn some music and get yourself pumped.
Now, get moving with a more difficult task.
Continue with each task.
Congratulations!,
Open your curtains/blinds and let sunlight shine on your new tidy room.
Do something fun in the room to enjoy the fact that it's clean!

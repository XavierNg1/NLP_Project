You don't need to use New Times Roman.
My advise is to go with Century Schoolbook L, which is preloaded on Openoffice.org.
I have found that, in Openoffice.org (at least the Linux version), Century Schoolbook L 12-point font takes up about the amount of space (slightly more) than 13-point Times New Roman.

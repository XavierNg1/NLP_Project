Look for a very large, hairy body and hairy legs.
Check for a red-brown to black color; most tarantulas don’t have obvious markings.
Observe the form.
Look for a single small group of typically eight eyes on the forehead, but all tightly clustered onto a single mound, not like shown here.
Look at the features of the mouth area; there are two backward-pointing fangs just below the eyes and 2 pedipalps (leg-like appendages) near the mouth.
Notice the fangs; tarantula’s fangs (and in other close families) move up and down (paraxial), whilst all other spider’s fangs move horizontally (axial) to pinch.

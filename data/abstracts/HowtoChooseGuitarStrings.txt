Figure out what kind of guitar you have.
If you have an electric guitar, the industry standard is nickel wound.
If you have an acoustic guitar, determine if it requires steel strings or nylon strings.
Nylon strings have a soft, mellow tone and are easy on the fingers.
Pick ball-end nylon strings, frequently called "folk nylon," if you want to become a folk guitar player.
Get Monel strings if your fingers are strong enough to handle the metal strings.
Select silk and steel for finger-style playing.
Pick bronze strings for finger picking on a folk guitar.
Buy a set of brass strings if you want your tone to be sharp and harsh.
Get flat-polished strings if you desire ease of playing.
Select flat-wound strings for any electric guitar.
Make sure to get the correct type of strings for your guitar.
If you are playing using alternate tunings, you may wish to get a set that will retain the same tension in that particular tuning as a set tuned to standard.

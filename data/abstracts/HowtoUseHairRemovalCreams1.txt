Find the right cream for your skin.
Talk to your doctor if you have very sensitive skin, a skin condition, or take any medications that may affect your skin.Because the cream is applied directly to the skin, the chemicals that break down the proteins in your hair will also interact with the proteins in your skin and could cause a reaction.
Do an allergy test 24 hours before using the cream, even if you've used it before.
Examine the area for any cuts, scrapes, moles, scars, cold sores, irritated or sunburnt skin.You want to minimize your chances of having a bad reaction to the cream and potentially developing a rash or chemical burn.
Take a shower or bath, drying your skin thoroughly afterwards.

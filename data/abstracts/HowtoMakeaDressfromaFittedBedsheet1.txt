Find or buy a fitted bed sheet.
Find the corners of your sheet.
Cut along the length of your sheet from corner to corner on both non-elasticized sides.
Unpick the corner seams.
Measure from just under your bust to where you want the skirt to fall.
Cut the sheet to double the length you just measured, measuring from one of the elasticized ends.

,
Pin the elastic together to form a circle, and check that you are able to stretch the elastic enough to wear it, and that it isn't too loose or too tight around your waist.
Sew the length of the sheet together.
Fold the material back on itself so you have a double thickness tube of fabric.
Sew the tops of the fabric together.
Turn the skirt the right way around and try it on, make sure that it is the right length and that it fits you.
Take one of the side pieces of the sheet and, with the hem at the top, wrap it around you, underneath your arms, crossing the hems over at the front.

,
Cut off the excess length of the material.

,
Tuck the top into the skirt and pin the top part to the skirt where the hems cross over and at each side.

,
Mark the line where the top of the dress will meet the skirt, while wearing the dress, with pins in the top part of the dress.
Take off the dress and stretch out the skirt enough to sew the top part of the dress to it, following the line you marked with the pins.

,
Sew the back of the dress to the skirt, once again stretching out the skirt just enough to do this.

,
Cut off any excess material from the top.

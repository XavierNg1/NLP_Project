Begin a study of the scriptures.
Look for evidence, as you study, that you are a child of God.
Begin renewing your mind, actions and thoughts to reflect the things you've studied (put on the new man, and all of the armor of God) as you are converted by God and are born again.
Call upon God in prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ.
Notice that God will be with you when you come across obstacles in your life that will be impossible to overcome, "all by yourself".

Cherish the moment: It won't matter what others think about you, what they say, or what you can and can't do.
Live for God, when it's all done: remember, if you are a Christian, you are living in the world, but you are not "of" the world.

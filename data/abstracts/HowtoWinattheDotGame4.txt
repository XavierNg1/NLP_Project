Since the mirror trick makes things even, it favors Player 1.
3x3's are so small that they tend to change some rules.
As many may have found out before, the way to change the turn in favor of Player 1 for mirror tricks is to give away the center box so that Player 2 is effectively playing ahead of Player 1, allowing him to copy.
Don't let Player 1 give you center box.
If Player 1 insists on playing exactly the same moves as you, then sacrifice non-chains repeatedly.
Against someone who isn't used to the mirror trick, the mirror trick tends to require almost no skill at all.

Get the right tools.
Shampoo twice to really get your hair clean.
Condition your hair several times to get it really soft.
While your hair is still dripping wet, apply some Infusium 23 leave-in conditioner.
Use a very, very small amount of serum or cream just on the ends of your hair.
Comb the front of your hair forward, and use the end of the thin comb to part it.
Wrap your hair turban-style in a towel, and just let it 'soak' for about 25 minutes.
Plug in your flat iron to let it heat up for a while.
When the bottom layer is completely dry, flat iron the hair.
When you've gotten the bottom layer perfected, ease out another layer and repeat steps 8 and 9 until you're all done.
To preserve your hairstyle and keep the retouching-time minimal in the morning, wrap your hair before you go to sleep.
Finished.

When you create your character make a custom class with all your major skills being the seven magical attributes.
Then get access to an spellmaking altar either through the arcane university or if you don't want to go through all that trouble get frostcrag spire (if you buy this you can access a glitch in which you can get as many of every sigil stone in the game and a very good mace which levels your blade skill) then create very weak spells for all of the skills of magic.
Once you have weak spells for all the magical attributes, just cast them constantly as you walk around doing your own thing and you will level very fast.
To master alchemy in like 20 minutes you must have collected the two of same kind of scroll and one of another describes earlier.
Also every single time you sleep and level up, you should train 5 times in something before the next time you sleep.

Consider moving to where there are people smiling on opportunity with hearts and minds open.
Have a one-track mind as a smarter working entrepreneur who has "the right idea at the right time".
Establish a formal business and place, if needed, if that is your intention; observe laws so that you can hire employees, or independent contractors, subcontractors, etc.
Don't be deterred nor let regulations, red tape or opinions stop you.
Expect help and courtesy from many departments who may eventually or occasionally visit your place of business, if you have one, including:


Fire department inspects the size, number, accessibility of fire extinguishers, identifying exits, exit doors unlocked for inside, and to open outward, and signs like "NOT an exit", etc.
Imagine without fear how and when you may innovate in the area of work and creating jobs.
Develop self-esteem using a one track mind: like great entrepreneurs and inventors who were criticized for taking huge risks, being stubbornly or oddly of an extremely "one-track-mind".
Devote your time to your calling -- as when inventing the light bulb, Edison reportedly worked 18 hours a day and tried over 1000 different filaments and other ideas to become more successful.

,
Take a risk: "Be the change you want to see in the world.",
Motivate yourself; get trained and educated "enough" or "just enough" for turning out to:


Be a unique student (You are one of a kind!),
Live Urgently, and do what you may to ignite your own job creation, and to show how you can be the best at educating yourself, and the kids.

,
Inspire yourself to enough intensity within so that you can get started working "smarter" (not just harder), learning and thinking more and then keeping yourself on your various goals to get on and stay on track.

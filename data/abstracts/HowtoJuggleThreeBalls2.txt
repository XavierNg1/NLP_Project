Move on to three balls.
Start with the right hand and throw ball 1 (blue) towards your left hand.
Release ball 2 (red) toward your right hand when ball 1 (blue) is about to land in your left.
When ball 2 (red) is about to arrive in your right hand, release ball 3 (green) on its arc back to your left hand.
Repeat the three ball juggling steps as necessary.

Choose a canvas or surface onto which you will place your design like a tabletop or onto a wall as a mural, directly.
Depending on the size of your chosen canvas or surface, you will need to adapt the quantities accordingly.
Start by priming the surface in black - two to three coats, allowing each to dry before applying the next.

,
Using your tape measure and pencil, divide the canvas into a grid of squares by measuring equal points along the edges.
This is where your reference material comes in and where you should take the most time.
Make sure your tape is stuck firmly, and give the whole canvas* another two to three coats of white paint.
Leaving all tape in place when the white paint is dry, begin filling in blocks of colour as you wish.
When all paint is dry (overnight to be sure) - the big reveal!

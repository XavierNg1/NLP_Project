Be objective: Objectivity is key when writing your mystery shopping reports.
Prepare for your mystery shops BEFORE the actual day you are assigned: Make sure you read over your mystery shop instructions several days in advance so you have enough time to contact your scheduler in case you have any questions or concerns about performing your shop.
Organize your mystery shopping jobs: You will find it to be beneficial if you organize each of your assignments by date.
Keep your shopper information up to date: Make sure your contact information (phone number, home address, email address) is always current so your Mystery Shopping Provider knows where/how to get a hold of you and so you are able to view the current open mystery shops in your area.

Take some time alone to allow your thoughts to arise without any judgments.
Discover what messages you've been telling yourself.
Listen to your emotions.
Allow your own emotions to flow freely.
Identify when you begin to absorb another person's emotional energies.
Another way to recognize other people's emotional states is to observe the person's behavior around others.
Listen to the things this person talks about.
Watch this person's behaviors.
When you recognize yourself getting nervous because the person beside you is emitting this energy, immediately tell yourself that you don't identify with their emotions anymore.
Try to imagine a steel wall around your heart, which only allows positive energy inside.
Imagine other's emotions floating around like little orbs.
Sometimes you need to remove yourself from the person or situation.
If you are unable to leave the situation, for example, you live with negative family members, then imagine the steel walls from your heart expanding to infinity.

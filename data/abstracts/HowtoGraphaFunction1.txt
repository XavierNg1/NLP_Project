Recognize linear functions as simple, easily-graphed lines, like y=2x+5{\displaystyle y=2x+5}.
Use the constant to mark your y-intercept.
Find the slope of your line with the number right before the variable.
Break the slope into a fraction.
Starting at your y-intercept, follow your "rise" and "run" to graph more points.
Use a ruler to connect your dots and graph your linear function.

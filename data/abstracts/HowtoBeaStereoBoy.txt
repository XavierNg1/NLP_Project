Love music.
Listen to a lot of underground music and go to lots of shows.
Be confident in yourself and everything you do.
Check your Myspace all the time.
Always have your camera with you to capture those Kodak moments you and your friends share.
Get the look:


Wear studded belts attached to the belt loops on your pants with the buckle turned to the side.
Only write in ink.
Have lots of rocker friends as well as skater, punk, emo,scene, and few preppy ones.

,
Use punk, skater, surfer and gangster slang.
Find a band or rapper you like.
Do sports that are extreme, such as football, moshing, BMX biking, motor-cross, or skateboarding.
If you can afford a car, get a cool looking classic car.
Get good grades and pay attention in class.
When people look through your mp3 player, you want them to say things like "I don't know any of these songs/bands"(that means you're truly Stereo).

,
Seek inspiration from the raddest punk rock guys.

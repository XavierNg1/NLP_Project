Ask your dad well before the day what sort of gadgets, apps or other technical things he likes are currently being released.
If you don't want to ask him, or your conversation doesn't really reveal many ideas, you'll need to focus directly on the techie things he already loves.
Go beyond what dad normally has.
Update dad's software or hardware.
If your dad is a reader, check out techie books.
Give dad some clothing that professes his techie fandom or geekiness.
Don't be stuck in the mindset of buying something as the only solution.
Consider the gift of apps.
Give him a trip away.
If you're a techie too, consider setting up an afternoon of techie tinkering together.

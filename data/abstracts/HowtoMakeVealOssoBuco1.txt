Pre-heat the oven to 350F.
Season your veal shanks with salt and pepper, then dust lightly with flour.
Warm up 2 tablespoons of olive oil on medium heat in a large dutch oven.
Cook all sides of the veal until browned, about 10 minutes per shank.
Melt 1-2 tablespoons of butter into the pot.
Add one small diced onion, one diced carrot, and one diced celery stalk to the pot and cook until tender.
Add the wine, bringing to a brief boil, and let it cook for about two minutes.
Add your stock, canned tomato, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaves, then nestle in the veal shanks.
Bring to a boil, cover the pot, then transfer everything quickly to the preheated oven.
Flip the veal shanks after an hour of cooking, then cook for another hour.
Remove the veal once it is tender enough to tear apart with a fork.
Cook the remaining liquid back on the stovetop on medium heat until it thickens to your liking.
Plate one veal shank per person, topping with vegetables and sauce just before serving.

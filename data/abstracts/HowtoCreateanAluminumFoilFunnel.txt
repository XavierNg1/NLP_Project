Create a model funnel using paper or soft cardboard that you can use as a mold.
Wrap the paper in a funnel shape.
Tape the model funnel together to hold it firmly.
Tear off a sheet of aluminum foil, slightly longer than the funnel model.
Wrap the foil around the model.
Tape the other end of the foil together to complete the funnel.
Remove the tape from the inside of the aluminum foil funnel to release it from the cardboard model.
Use funnel immediately.

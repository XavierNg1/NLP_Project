Take control of your life.
Let go of what you can't change.
Figure out what makes you happy.
Realize that some things just can't be changed.
Realize you can't do it all.
Understand you may not be who you used to be.
Change the "I'm not" to "I am.",
Put yourself first.
Put yourself out there.
Stop basing your worth on external factors.

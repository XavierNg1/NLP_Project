Keep in mind that all people in the world are equal to you.
Have a smile and try to look inviting.
Do not behave in a way that may make others uncomfortable, including swearing, being mean, yelling, and saying rude things.
Refrain from talking extremely loudly, but be careful not to be so quiet that no one understands you.
Involve yourself by being friendly to people in your class.
Try to look clean and make good first impressions.
Find some common ground between yourself and the people you are attempting to befriend.
Be yourself and show your personality, for as time goes on, it is very difficult to continuously keep up an act.
Don't gossip or spread rumors about other people, true or not true.

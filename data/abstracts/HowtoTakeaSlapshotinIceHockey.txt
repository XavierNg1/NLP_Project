Understand how a slap-shot works.
Learn when to take a slap-shot.
Point your feet towards the puck, which should be about 3 feet (0.9Â m) from your skates.
Glance at the net.
Get the proper grip.
Wind up.
Take another look at the goal and aim as you wind up.
Make contact with the ice inches before you hit the puck.
During contact with the puck, roll your wrists so that the thumb on your dominant hand (right hand if right-handed, left hand if left-handed) turns down towards the ice.
Follow through with your shot to where you're aiming.

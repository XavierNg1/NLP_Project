Get a good camera: virtually any 35mm SLR or dslr camera with interchangeable lens will do.
If possible use the normal (50mm lens).
Set your camera at a low ISO--the lower the ISO, the better.
Shoot ONLY in the 30-45 minute window AFTER the suns sets or BEFORE it rises.
The only other option is the magical sky that occurs right after a rainstorm when the sky is clean and glowing - cloudy but brightening.

If you can see shadows the light is bad.

,
Put your subject outdoors at least 15 feet (4.6Â m) or more in front of a natural backdrop of trees or tall bushes or anything natural.
Get close to your subject - you want their face to fill most of the frame.
When the light is good and your subject is relaxed, shoot LOTS of exposures.
When you develop the film insist on Matte or Luster finish.

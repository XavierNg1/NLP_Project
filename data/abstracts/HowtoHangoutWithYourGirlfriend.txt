Think of some ideas for hanging out: Movie night, game night, costume party, play in a park, sports, crafts, etc.
Realize that it doesn't have to be just you and her every time.
Don't be afraid to try new things.
Don't do the same thing every time you're together.
Rely on spontaneity sometimes, but not always.
Enjoy each other's company.

Combine the dry ingredients for this corn-dog batter recipe in a medium bowl.

,
Heat vegetable oil in a heavy, deep-sided saucepan until it reaches 375 degrees Fahrenheit (191 degrees Celsius).
Inset a skewer into each of the hot dogs, leaving enough of the skewer sticking out of one end to use for a handle.
Rub each hotdog with cornstarch so the batter will better adhere to the hot dogs.
Cook the corn dogs.
Remove the corn dogs carefully from the oil using metal tongs.
Allow the corn dogs to cool slightly before eating.
Finished.

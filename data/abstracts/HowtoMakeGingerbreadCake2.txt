Preheat the oven to 375°F (190.56°C) and prepare a 15 by 10 inch (38.1 by 25.4 centimeters) jelly roll pan.
Beat 3 egg yolks until they are thickened.
Mix molasses, honey, and melted butter into the beaten egg yolk.
Beat the 3 egg whites until they turn white, foamy, and peaky.
Slowly add the sugar into the beaten egg whites.
Fold the egg whites mixture into the egg yolks mixture.
Sift in the flour, baking soda, salt, and spices.
Spread the mixture over the baking pan.
Bake the cake for 11 minutes or until the top is springy, then let it cool for 3 minutes.
Turn the cake onto a damp tea towel dusted with confectioners/icing sugar.
Roll the cake up like a cinnamon roll.
Let the cake finish cooling while you prepare the filling.
Unroll the cake, remove the tea towel, and spread two-thirds of your filling over the top.
Re-roll the cake and finish spreading the rest of the filling over it.

The simple way to develop your rhythm is with simple clapping exercises.
Get someone, be it a friend, a family member, or a music teacher/tutor, to clap a simple tune/rhythm.
Get someone to play a rhythmic melody (piano or any other instrument will do) and see if you can copy the rhythm played by clapping it out.
For homework: When listening to your favourite music, try nodding to the beat, then clapping or clicking your fingers to time.

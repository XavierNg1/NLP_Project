Ensure your cubic has a constant.
Find the factors of a and d. To solve your cubic, start by finding the factors of a (the coefficient of the x3 term) and d (the constant at the end of the equation).
Divide the factors of a by the factors of d. Next, make a list of the values you get by dividing each factor of a by each factor of d. This will usually result in lots of fractions and a few whole numbers.
Use synthetic division or check your answers manually.

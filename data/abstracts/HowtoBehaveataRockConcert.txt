Obey the rules for the venue where you are attending, including drinking and recreational drug use.
Be polite to people around you.
Keep your hands, elbows, and generally all of your body parts to yourself.
Go with the flow.
Don't be disrespectful about other bands there that you may not like, especially when conversing with your friends.
Dress appropriately.

Enjoy yourself.

Buy, borrow, or otherwise finagle a portable meat grinder.
Get your preferred meat.
Bone out the meat, and remove the cartilage, excessive amounts of fat, sinew, and tendons.

,
Cut the meat into chunks of about one or two inches, depending on the hopper (opening where the meat goes in the grinder).

,
Measure your choice of spices, making sure they are fresh and high quality.
Place a plastic or stainless steel mixing bowl underneath the outlet of your grinder.
Begin stuffing the chunks of meat, and small scoops of your seasoning mixture into the throat of the grinder, with the grinder turning.
Push the meat down the throat of the grinder hopper with a wooden spoon.
Check the "grind", or coarseness of the meat as it comes out of the grinder.
"Knead" the ground meat (it is now "mince", by the way), to finish mixing the ingredients.
Form "patties" by rolling 1/4 cup of meat into balls, then flattening them on waxed paper.
Fry the patties as you would any uncooked patty type sausages, being sure to cook them thoroughly, since they are made with raw meat.

,
Test each batch you make, using care to measure the ingredients, so that you can adjust to your personal taste.Finished.
Finished.

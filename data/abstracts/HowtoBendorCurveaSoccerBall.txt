Be realistic.
Place the ball on the ground on the right side of 18-yard line for righties and on the left side for lefties.

,
Take about two to three steps back and two to the side (the side where you want the ball to go).

,
Look at the point of the ball where you want to hit the ball.
Take a running start.
Make sure to swing your hips.

,
Keep your ankle locked and keep your body over the ball.
When kicking the ball, kick as though you slightly roll it just along the outside of your kicking foot's toe-to-ball of feet.

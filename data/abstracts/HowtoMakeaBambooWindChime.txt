Find some bamboo.
Cut the bamboo into six lengths.
Split the hollow end of each piece.
Drill 1/8 inch (3mm) holes just above the section on the solid end of each piece, parallel to the cut you made on the opposite end.
Cut a round piece of plywood or other material about 7 times the diameter of the average piece of bamboo.
Lay out the disk into 6 equal spaces around the circumference, then drill a 1/8 inch (3mm) hole about 3/4 inch (~2cm) on either side of the layout marks, near the edge of the disk.

,
Thread a piece of string through one of the holes, and tie off one end.
Thread your string through the holes in the end of one bamboo section, then back through the hole in the plywood on the other side of your layout mark.
Adjust the individual sticks so that each one is staggered higher or lower than the adjacent one.
Drill three holes about 1 1/2 inches (3.8cm) from the center of your plywood disk, equally spaced around it.
Thread one string through each hole in the plywood, snug them slightly, and while holding the disk level, drop some hot-melt glue on each to secure it in place.

,
Cut a smaller disk of your plywood, about 1 1/2 times the diameter of your bamboo pieces smaller than your first (top) disk.
Secure these strings to the plywood, using hot-melt glue again, keeping this smaller disk level also.
Cut a shape of plywood or other material to hang below the hammer, or lower disk, and tie it on the end of your three strings.
Secure any loose ends of strings, gluing everything with an extra bit of hot-melt glue so nothing comes untied while your chime blows in the breeze.
Finished.

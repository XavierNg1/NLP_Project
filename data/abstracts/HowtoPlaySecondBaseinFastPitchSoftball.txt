If the ball is hit to first, and the first baseman has to run off, back them up.
If the ball is hit to short stop or third base (left field) run to second.
When the batter shows bunt, cover first base because first baseman will come closer to home for a bunt.
If the batter shows bunt and there is a runner on first and third then you will have the cover second base in case there is a throw down from the catcher to you.
Back up your teammates in case of bad throws.
If the ball is hit to the outfield, don't forget about cutoffs.
After every pitch thrown by the pitcher, back up the throw from the catcher to the pitcher.
When a batter gets walked or gets a drop third strike, they might touch first and round it so they can attempt to go to second base.
When there is a runner on second, stop going to second for a throw down because the catcher will rarely throw down to second with a runner there.
If you have a runner going from first to second and the ball is hit to you, depending on where you are either throw to first or step on second.
Know the boundary line between you and short stop.

Prepare your potting soil in a separate bucket.
Choose a small pot with drainage holes.
Fill the pot with soil.
Make a Â½ inch (1.27 centimeter) deep hole in the soil.
Choose a plump-looking seed from a lemon.
Wash the seed to get rid of the slimy coating.
Drop the seed into the hole and cover it up.
Cover the pot with a piece of breathable plastic to trap warmth and moisture.
Place the pot in a warm location.
Water the soil when you see it become dry.
Remove the plastic covering once the sprout appears and transfer the pot to a warm, sunny location.

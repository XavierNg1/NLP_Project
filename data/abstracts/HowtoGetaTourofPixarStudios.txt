Know that once in a while Pixar holds charity events where they sell tickets and give little tours of the studio.
If you know somebody that works at Pixar, it could be a family or friend, you can get them to give you a tour of the studio.
Keep in mind that along with the whole 'knowing a guy' thing, Pixar also shows private screenings of their movies a few months before they come to theaters.
Apply to work there.
Enter contests.This isn't very common, but sometimes Pixar does hold contests to either win merchandise, or even tickets to have a tour at the studio.
Go to www.pixarplanet.com where they show 'Up coming events' to let people know if they're having either contests, charity events, and much more.

Go buy yourself a car.
Have a look through Car Magazines, Internet Searches and even Car Show Events, to see what other people have done.
If you want your car be street drivable, ensure that every Mod you do is legal in your State or Country.
Once the car is finished, take it to your local car show & start winning trophies!

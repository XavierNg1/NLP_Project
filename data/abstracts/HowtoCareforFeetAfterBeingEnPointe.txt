Take your shoes off after class and walk around barefoot to cool them down and loosen them up a little.
Stand at the barre (if wearing convertible tights, roll them up) with your feet in parallel.
When you get home from class massage your feet.
After you loosen them up a bit, put your feet in warm, salty water to relax them.
When you take your feet out pat them dry and put some skin lotion on them.
Massage and bend your feet and toes forward and back to put some more movement in them.
Preparing for your next time on pointe starts as soon as you get home.

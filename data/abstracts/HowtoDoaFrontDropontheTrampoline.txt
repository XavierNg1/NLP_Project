Lie face down on the trampoline bed.
Lift your neck and face and place your hands in line with your eyes, palm down on the trampoline, with your fingers pointing towards each other and touching, not overlapping.
Get in to the center of the trampoline and get on your hands and knees.
Move on to the middle of the trampoline once you have mastered landing in the right position without jarring.
Jump up, slightly bend your legs, through your hips, backwards and upwards and place your chest where your feet were (or just behind) - never in front.

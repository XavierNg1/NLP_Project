Introduce yourself.
Ask inventive questions.
Compliment her, but make sure you mean it.
Be nice to her!,
Introduce her to your other friends and call her by her name, not as 'the new girl.',
Offer to eat lunch with her or sit next to her in class.
Give her some advice.
Ask for her contact details and give her yours.
Invite her out at the weekend with your friends.
If she's sitting alone at class, sit with her, but don't use a blank expression when you walk over to her (at least while she's still getting used to things).
If she comes to you asking a doubt, don't discourage her!

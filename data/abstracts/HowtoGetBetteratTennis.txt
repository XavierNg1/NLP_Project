Learn the right way to grip a tennis racket.
Choose racket that is suitable for your age and strength.
Practice hitting and get to know other players on the court by introducing yourself.
Warm-up and play matches about twice a week.
Try these plans of attack during a match:


a) Serve & Volley (serve hard and charge the net position)
b) Chip & Charge (hit a deep ball and charge)
c) Inside-Out Forehand (sidestep around a ball hit to your backhand side and hit it using a forehand stroke)
d) Junk Balling (hit only slices with backspin)
e) Rally & Wait (exchange ground strokes and go for a hard winner)

,
Always keep your eye on the ball.
Stretch before and after you play so you don't pull a muscle.
Do not rush your shots, try to imagine your movements in slow-motion and really focus on getting in position for every ball that comes to you.
Plant your feet just before hitting.
Leading on from that, be aware of your position on the court.
Determine your playing style.
Be aware of your opponent's game plan.
Use the whole of the court, this applies to both your positioning and your shot direction.
When rallying from the baseline, try to achieve as much height over the net as you can without compromising speed.
Make a conscious effort to use different spins.
Don't be afraid to get up to the net.
Lots of players aren't that concerned about their serve, choosing rather to practice their ground strokes.

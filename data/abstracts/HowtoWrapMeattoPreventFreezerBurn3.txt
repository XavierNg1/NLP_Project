For this method, if you're using multiple cuts of meat (or ground meat) in the package, you'll need to take care to keep the paper pressed tight against all sides of the meat.
Set the meat in the upper right corner of the paper.
Fold the end of the corner over the meat and flip the meat over towards the center.
Along one side of the meat, fold the paper over itself just a bit.
Fold the same side of paper over the meat.
Flip the meat again, keeping the paper going lengthwise with the meat very tight.
Do the same thing with the paper on the other side of the meat as you did with the first side.
Flip the meat towards the far end of the paper until the paper's nearly all used.
Tape the package.
Label the package with its contents!

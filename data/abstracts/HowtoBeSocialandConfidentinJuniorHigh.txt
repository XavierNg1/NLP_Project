It's a new year and a new school.
Get prepared the night before.
Get a good night's sleep.
Take a shower early in the morning before school, so you can feel refreshed.
New year, new appearance.
When you go to school, have a positive attitude.
Get involved in school activities.
Always smile and say Hi.
Consider, if you like someone,if you were friends first, will this help your chances?,
Spot some old friends if it makes you feel more comfortable.
Don't worry about your teacher or classes, think positive thoughts on how much fun they could be.

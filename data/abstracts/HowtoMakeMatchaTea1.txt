Sift 1½ scoop of matcha powder into a small tea bowl and set it aside.
Pour 2 ounces (60 milliliters) of hot water into a separate tea cup.The water needs to be just below boiling, about 165 to 180°F (75 to 80°C).
Slowly pour the hot water into the tea bowl.
Whisk the tea rapidly for 10 to 15 seconds with a "chasen" using a zigzag motion.A chasen is a delicate, bamboo whisk made specifically for preparing matcha tea.Do not use a metal fork or whisk as this will affect the flavor and aroma of the tea.
Pour the tea back into the tea cup and drink it immediately.

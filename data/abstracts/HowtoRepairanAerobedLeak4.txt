Consider returning the mattress.
Gather your materials.
Cut a patch from a repair kit or a spare piece of vinyl so that it will cover the tear.

,
Smear an ample amount of adhesive over the tear.
Press the two sides of the seam together.
Let the adhesive dry almost completely.This is called “setting up” and will take a few hours.

,
Apply a layer of adhesive to the patch.
Place the vinyl patch onto the newly applied rubber cement, following the instructions on your repair kit.
Allow the adhesive to dry completely.Drying times will vary depending on the adhesive but 6-8 hours is a good bet.

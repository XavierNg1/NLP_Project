Check your assumptions.
Pretend that you are a consumer.
Pretend that you are a supplier.
Picture yourself at a market with three apple stands in front of you.
Picture yourself as the owner of one apple stand.
Let's assume that at a price of one dollar a piece, suppliers bring 100 apples to the market and consumers are willing to buy 90 apples at that price.
Now let's assume that at a price of ninety cents a piece, suppliers bring 100 apples to the market and consumers are willing to buy 110 apples.
See that the market will correct itself until a point of equilibrium is reached.

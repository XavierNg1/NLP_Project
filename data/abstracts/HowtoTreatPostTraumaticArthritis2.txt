Opt for over-the-counter painkillers.One way to treat the pain associated with post-traumatic arthritis is to purchase over-the-counter painkillers from your local drugstore or pharmacy.
Ask your doctor for a corticosteroid injection.Corticosteroids work to reduce pain locally (when they are injected into the affected joint) by diminishing inflammation and swelling in the area.
Inquire about hyaluronic acid.Hyaluronic acid is a type of synthetic joint fluid (kind of like an artificial synovial fluid, which is the fluid that naturally lubricates your joints).
Consider surgery as a last resort.When lifestyle modifications and medical treatments are no longer sufficient to help you manage your joint pain from post-traumatic arthritis, it is likely time to consider surgery.

Think of your happiest memory.
Amuse yourself.
Make yourself laugh.
Forget about all the bad things for a second and think about everything good in your life.
Get on the Internet, search for stories about people who overcame illnesses, or brave people who saved lives.
Do something that makes you feel proud of yourself.
Think, "This person one of my best friends.",
Fake a smile for 30 mins and then you will realize you are smiling for real!

,
Think positively about your self, what weird things did you do; did you tell your crush you like him, or did you lie down in the rain?

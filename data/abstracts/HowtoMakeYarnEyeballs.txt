Cut a short piece off a soda straw or other small, plastic tubing.

Thread a yarn or tapestry needle with the background color yarn.
,

Use the needle to pull the yarn through the piece of straw.

Pull the needle through the straw again, forming a loop around the straw.

Repeat, always working in the same direction, forming loops all the way around the straw.
,

Stop when there's not enough space in the middle for the needle, or when you have a full, round eye.

Work across the front of the eyeball into one of the loops on the opposite side.

Thread a smaller needle with embroidery floss or string in a contrasting color.
,

Work loops under and across the sideways stitch that you created in the last step.

Work until you have a dense, dark "pupil" of the contrasting thread.
Trim the pupil threads close to the base.

Tie the tails from the first color at the back of the eye to hold them in place.

Use the tapestry needle that should still be attached to pull the eye into the craft.

Secure the tails to the craft or to each other.

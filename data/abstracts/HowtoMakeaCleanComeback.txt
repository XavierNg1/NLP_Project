Be relaxed, as usual.
Don't overdo it.
Try to avoid saying "um" and "uh".
Be clever enough to make it so they can't think of another comeback to your comeback.
Put what they say to your advantage.
Pretend to be in a hurry and say, "I don't have time for this.",
Even if you have a good comeback, don't use it again.
Don't totally change the subject.
Last but not least: be confident.

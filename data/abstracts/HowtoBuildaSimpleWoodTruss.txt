Determine if homemade trusses are suitable for the project you're building.
Design your truss.
Select the appropriate lumber for the truss you'll construct.
Set up sawhorses or another flat, stable work place to build your trusses.
Place the bottom chord board with the crown up, then place the boards the top chords will be cut from over it, so each member laps where they will intersect when the truss is built.
Mark the top cuts on the top chords where they will meet at the roof peak.
Determine whether the top chord or bottom chord will overhang the eave of your building, and then choose the appropriate bottom cut of the top chord.
Locate the position of the intermediate diagonal bracing members you'll need to complete the truss.
Use one of each unique member you have marked and cut as a pattern to mark subsequent members for each truss you plan to build.
Determine if toe-nailing the members will create a strong enough truss for you project.
Nail each member of the first truss together, supporting it at intersections with additional boards or posts to keep the assembly flat while it is laying on it's side.
Use the first truss you assembled as a template to assemble the remaining trusses.
Stack the completed trusses on dunnage so they lay as flat as possible, and in the best alignment you can achieve to prevent them from warping prior to installation.
Install your trusses on the project you're building.

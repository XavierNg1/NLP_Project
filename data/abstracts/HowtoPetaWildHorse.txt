When attempting to deal with any animal, the best approach is to understand how it communicates and thus communicate with it.

Always approach the horse from the side.
Move toward the horse gradually, talking to it in a low, soothing voice as you do so.
When you are near the horse, slow down and imitate a nicker as well as you can.
Reach out your hand, making sure that your fingers are pressed together and not splayed out.

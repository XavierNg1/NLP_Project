Pick a dart that's right for you.
Stand on the oche (pronounced like 'hockey' minus the 'h', aka the toe-line) with the foot corresponding to which hand you intend to throw with perpendicular to the line.
Draw an imaginary line from where your toe touches the line perpendicular to the oche.
Stand up straight, shoulders back but comfortable and in line with the center of the board.








,
You can bend forward (toward the board) slightly at the waist, but you should not sacrifice balance or cause discomfort doing so.








,
Grip the dart lightly in your throwing hand.
When you throw, move only your throwing arm.
Concentrate on throwing the exact same way at the same point for a few throws.

Make decluttering a habit.
If you have more than one of any particular item, think about keeping the better model and passing on the other(s. Maybe you have a friend who can make better use out of your spare vacuum than you can.
Keep a photo of the item instead.
Write a short history of the item to go with the photo.
Look for ways the item could be more useful to someone else.
Focus on the positive results of decluttering your home: more space, fewer things dragging you down, and less fuel in case of a house fire.

,
Consider selling the item and using the money for something that you need or want, and which would be more useful or attractive.
Once you've made the decision, get rid of it immediately.
If you can't quite bring yourself to get rid of it, pack it up and put it somewhere to store for a set amount of time, such as a year or six months.
If the previous tip doesn't work for you, because you see an item and think "I would definitely have used that if I knew it was there", don't put the item back in the box/ drawer/ closet.
Don't be too hard on yourself if you still can't bring yourself to get rid of some things.

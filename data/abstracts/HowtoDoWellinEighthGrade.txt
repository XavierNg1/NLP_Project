Prepare yourself.
Shop for school at least a week before your start day of classes.
The night before that first day of school, get together everything you will need for the next day.
On the first day, get up as soon as your alarm goes off, that way if you need extra time, you have it.
Have a binder with dividers for each subject helps you stay organized throughout the school year.
As soon as you get home from school, have a snack (if needed) and start on your homework right away.
Approximately three months before your graduation set a budget with your parents that includes the cost of your hair, nails and toes, jewelry, and dress.

,Make sure you've purchased a dress that fits and book any appointments for your hair and nails a couple months in advance.
Make sure that you also have a pair of shoes that match your dress and that you can easily walk in them.

,
On the morning of graduation, sleep in to whenever you want (just make sure you don't miss any appointments you may have that day!)

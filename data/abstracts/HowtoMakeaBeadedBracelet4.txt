Gather your supplies.
Measure your wrist and add Â¼ to 1 inch (0.64 to 2.54 centimeters).
Cut two pieces of thread that are twice the length of your measurement.
Hold the two threads together, fold them in half, and tie a large knot near the top of the loop.
Place a drop of super glue onto the knot and fold a bead tip over it.
Put all four strands of the thread through a beading needle and start stringing your beads.
Take the needle off the thread and tie a few knots close to the last bead.
Place a drop of glue onto the knots and fold a bead tip over them.
Repeat this process to create as many strands as you want.
Open two jump rings using a pair of needle nose pliers.
Put one part of the clasp and the beaded strands onto one jump ring.
Close the jump ring.
Repeat the process for the other clasp and the other end of the beaded strands.

Tell teddy what's going on.
Remind your Teddy he needs to be on best behaviour.
Introduce teddy.
Allow teddy to choose his dinner.
Pretend to feed him and give him a drink.
Be polite.
Make sure your teddy does not drop anything on the floor.
If your teddy needs to go to the toilet, excuse yourself and take him up.
If your teddy falls over cuddle him and ask to be excused so that you can go inside and comfort them.
If your teddy feels tired, lie him down in a bed inside.
When it's time to go home, wake up your teddy (if he's asleep) and either fasten on his seatbelt (if you're driving home) or carry him, ready for the walk home.

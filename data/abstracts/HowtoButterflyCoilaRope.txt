Double the rope.



 

Set aside a loose end.





Measure another full arms' length and put it on your shoulders, with your neck in the center.
,

Coil the rest of the rope behind your neck.

Take the coiled rope off your shoulders.

Wrap the folded rope just below your hand 4 or 5 times around with the two free ends of the rope set aside in the first step.

Pull the loose ends partially through the fold with your hand, making a loop.





Hold the coiled rope by the loose ends and swing it to your back.





Bring the loose ends around to your back again, where they will intersect over the coiled rope, preventing it from bouncing around as you're walking.
,





Bring the free ends forward once again, this time around your waist, and tie a square knot.

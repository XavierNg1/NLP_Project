Be sure to paint in a dust-free environment.
If painting indoors, be sure to use a quality air mask.
Don't paint in an area where overspray will affect furniture or floors.
Placing the guitar body inside a large box on top of a portable worktable (such as a TV tray) will greatly reduce overspray and will protect other items in the area.
Choose the paint or stain you want to use.
Apply a few coats of primer/sealer.
If using a solid color, apply the coats of paint.
If using a stain, wipe on the stain.
Apply a clear coat to the guitar.
Wait.
Polish the finish.
Reassemble the guitar.

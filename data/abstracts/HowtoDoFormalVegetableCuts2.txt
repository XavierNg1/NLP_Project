Select your vegetable: Julienne can be done with any firm vegetable, such as carrot, celery, potato, capsicum / bell pepper, turnip, swede/rutabaga, zucchini/courgette, sweet potato / kumara etc.
Peel your vegetable and cut into 5cm / 2 inch portions with as straight a cut as possible.
Sit the vegetable upright on the cut edge and cut the rounded edges off.
Slice the vegetable into strips 4mm or 1/8inch wide.
Stack these up again like a stack of cards as high as you feel safe with to slice.
You have now achieved your Julienne cut vegetables.

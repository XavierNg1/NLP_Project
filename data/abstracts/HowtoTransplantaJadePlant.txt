Transplant the jade plant in early spring.
Use a heavy clay, terra cotta or ceramic container.
Make sure the container has at least one drain hole in the bottom.
Find a container that is only 1 to 2 inches deeper and wider than the old container.
Use a peat-based potting mix with extra coarse builderâ€™s sand or perlite added in.
Put the new potting mix into the container at a depth of 1 to 2 inches.
Remove the jade plant from its old container.
Disinfect a pair of sharp scissors with a household disinfectant like Lysol.
Trim off any roots that are much longer than the root mass.
Put the jade plant in the new container.
Water the jade plant with room-temperature water until it drains from the bottom.
Take special care of the jade plant for four weeks after transplanting it.
Water the plant with room-temperature water when the top of the potting mix begins to dry.
Do not overwater the plant.
Avoid giving the plant any fertilizer while the root system is recovering.
Keep the plant out of direct sunlight.

When you start to feel a panic attack coming on, ask yourself the following questions:


What is there to be afraid of in my environment?,
Realize that there is nothing to be afraid of and reassure yourself of this.
Once you realize that there is nothing to be afraid of, breathe deeply and allow the fear the subside.
Next, gently stretch your facial and neck muscles, as well as your jaw muscles.
Try to take control of your actions during the panic attack.

As always, warm up your voice with simple vocal exercises, such as humming through ascending arpeggios etcetera before you sing.
Identify the high note you want to hit.
Sing the note an octave below it first.
Place your voice high up in your head (above your cheekbones, or even above your eyebrows).
Remember that though your voice is placed in your head, it first stemmed from your diaphragm.
Practice singing the two notes an octave apart for many times.

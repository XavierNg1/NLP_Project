Consider the complexity of your car before beginning and take your car to a trusted repair shop.
Check for check engine lights or maintenance required lights on the dash board instrument cluster.
The stall is likely caused by either a problem in the electrical system or in the fuel system.
Drive the car up and down steep hills.
Does the car idle roughly and stall when at idle?,
If your car has a distributor, you might consider changing the cap, rotor, wires and plugs.
If your car diesels when you turn off the ignition, it means that your car most likely has a carburetor and the idle speed adjustment is too high.
In rare cases, your car may stall due to what is commonly called a "vapor lock," a situation that occurs when the fuel lines supplying gas to the engine become hot enough to boil the gas in the line turning it into vapor.

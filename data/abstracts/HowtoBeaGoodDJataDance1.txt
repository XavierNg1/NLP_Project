Amount of Music : Before you can even begin to play music at a school dance it is important to have a large selection of music prepared ahead of time.
Type of Music : When you accept the gig be sure to ask the event coordinator what type of music has been played at these events in the past as you want to ensure you have appropriate music for the venue and the crowd.
Radio Edits : Always ask the event coordinator how much tolerance there will be for objectionable language.

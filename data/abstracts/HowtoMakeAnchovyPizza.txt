Make your pizza dough.
Tip the dough onto a clean bench and knead dough until it feels smooth.
Place the dough back into the bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and allow to sit until doubled in size.
Preheat oven to 195C / 385F.
Dust the counter top with a little semolina to prevent the dough from sticking.
Prepare your toppings.
Brush dough with a little olive oil and press the oil in gently with your finger tips.
Add your extra toppings.
Don't rush this stage as it will cut down on proving time and will improve the quality of your work.
Either place the tray into the oven, or remove the hot stone (carefully), slide the pizza on and swiftly place back into the oven.

You must obtain an internal hard drive (from now on referred to as a HDD).
Choose and purchase a compatible enclosure.
Unwrap both your enclosure and HDD.

,
Follow your instructions on how to correctly open your enclosure.

,
Set your HDD to the Master setting (or Master/No Slave if one exists).
Connect your enclosure's Molex power connector and ATA/SATA ribbon cable to your HDD.
Screw the HDD into the enclosure.
Take one last look at the inside before you close it.
Close the enclosure.

,
Connect the power cord (if one is necessary) and the USB or FireWire cord to your drive.

,
USB and FireWire are Plug-and-Play, meaning that you do not need to turn off the computer before connecting your drive.
Turn your computer on if it is not already.
You should see a new device in the 'Devices with Removable Storage' section.

,
Right click on it and select Format (about halfway down the list).

,
Format the drive using NTFS for use in Windows (ext3 is good for Linux) as the File System.
Wait for formatting to complete.
Good Job!

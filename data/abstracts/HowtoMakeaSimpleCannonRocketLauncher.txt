Gather the required materials.
Build the rocket motor or launcher.
To align the cans, make a tube for the cans to fit in.
Take a sheet of the 8.5" X 11" cardstock and fold it in half so you have 8.5" X 5.5".
Tape each one of the cut pieces end to end so you get 88" X 5.5".
Cut a piece of masking tape 3/4" long and place 1/4" of it on one end of the card sections and the other part of it on the mandrel.
Slip the tube off the mandrel for about 2" and place the bean can over the tube.
Fuel the motor.
Launch the rocket motor.

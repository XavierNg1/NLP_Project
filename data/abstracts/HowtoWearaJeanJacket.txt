Pick a color.
Choose the wash.
Ask yourself if you need lining.Denim jackets without a liner lend themselves to chic fashion choices more readily, but jackets with liners have a more practical use.
Pay attention to the cut.
Consider the overall look.
Wear the jacket with other shades of denim.
Pair the jean jacket with non-jean bottoms.
Keep things simple.
Add a classic twist to trendy look.Tone down an otherwise loud fad with a subtle blue jean jacket.
Wear the jacket with ultra-feminine pieces.Long, flowing dresses and skirts match surprisingly well with denim jackets.
Shape up.
Choose your trousers carefully.
Wear the jacket under another layer.Layering is a great way to add texture and visual interest.
Let the jacket stand in for a blazer.If you want a semi-professional look suitable for "casual Fridays," you can replace your usual blazer with a classic, dark wash jean jacket.
Wear a simple t-shirt or sweater.
Go with classic plaid.

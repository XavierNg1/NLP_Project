Identify that the battery really needs changed.
Order a battery online or go out and buy one from a brick and mortar store if you can't wait.
Collect the tools that you will need (see the "Things You'll Need" section below for a list of tools.),
Once you have your tools you can begin.
Use the screwdriver to take the four screws off the back of the watch.
Once you have all of the screws loosened, remove the case back.
Put on your gloves if you have them.
Try not to detach the small layer of plastic (it's over the inside of the watch, and it has several holes in it), as it will be hard to get back on.
Slide the battery under and out of the plastic layer and discard it once it is dislodged.

,
Take your new battery out of its casing.
Put the watch above your head to see if it is working.
Grease the gasket if you have silicon grease.
Gently pull the gasket (it is black and all around the exterior of the inside) out, and put a thin layer all over it.
Gently place the gasket back into place.
Put your case back back over the watch.

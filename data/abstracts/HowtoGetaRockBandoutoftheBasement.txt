Think hard, be real, and come to an agreement on the direction of the tunes you want to play.
Talk about the band to others (no, don't brag... just chat).
Know your stuff.
Practice regularly.
Communicate before and after practices.
Get a communal calendar that you all can get to (Google, spreadsheet, or a wall calendar).
Have an agreement on how much (or how little) money the band will play for, so that any band mate with the calendar can speak for the band to play any job offered ("cool", "sorry, we need a little more gas money to play").

,
Set up the band equipment like you are at a job, if you have the space.
Learn your parts of tunes before practice.
Have a set list for each job.
Designate an air traffic controller for jumping into the pocket (often the drummer or the bandleader).
Playing to the crowd is often less satisfying as a band member (you might not play your best or hardest tunes), but having the crowd jumping on the dance floor is very cool, very fun, and very entertaining to watch while you play.

When things screw up (and they DO) don't let it show.

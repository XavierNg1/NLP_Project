Make sure you wake up on time so that you will arrive at school on time.
Before classes start, hand in any forms or applications to a staff member or ask a teacher for guidance.
If you have time to socialize before class starts, do so with your new classmates.
Before you start showing your true self, observe how others act.
Smile and keep it soft and natural!,
Don't be afraid to start conversations with your new classmates, even if you aren't familiar with them.
After you get to know people more, invite any new friends on outings after school so that you can get to know them better.
Have fun and relax at your new school.

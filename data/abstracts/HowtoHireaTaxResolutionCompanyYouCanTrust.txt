Be leery of demands that the company be paid in full upfront.
Decide on the type of company you want to work with.
Ask for the names of the owners of the company.
Ask, "How long has your company been in business?",
Ask "What is the firm's success rate"?,
Do not feel pressured to hire the company.
Run if a company "guarantees" specific results.

Decide if you are using a boffer or latex weapon.
Choose what style of sword you are using.
Practice lunging, and then returning to an "en garde" position.
Divide the blade of your sword into thirds.
Learn the three kinds of blocks: Hard block, parry, and beat.
Now, you need to learn the basic strikes: Thrust, and slash.
Hold your sword with your dominant hand higher on the hilt than your other hand.

,
If you have a ricasso, grip it with your weak hand, and slide your dominant hand down to the pommel for more leverage.

,
For two-weapon fighting (florentine) you need to keep an even stance, not an en garde position.
Use your swords together.
Never commit both swords to a strike or block.
Invent your own strike patterns, and combinations.

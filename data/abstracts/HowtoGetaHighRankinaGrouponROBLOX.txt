Join an active group which hasn't got too many members.
Be as active as you can and try to come to group events when others are on.
Be an active poster on the group wall/forum.
Go to training sessions a lot.
Recruit people for the group.
In group events, show respect, responsibility, and listening skills.
Don't team kill.
Follow orders from higher ranks first time.
Offer to do or make something for the group, such as a training base or a raiding center.
You can put the group as your primary group and favorite all the group places along with sending friend requests to a lot of the members but this will not necessarily secure you a promotion.

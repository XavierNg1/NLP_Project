Pick a rifle that fits you.
One method of sighting at home is to bore-sight it.
Tuck the stock into your right shoulder, where it feels comfortable.
Place your dominant hand on the grip.
Note the distance from your shoulder to the grip.
Instead of moving your eye down to the rifle, hold the rifle across your body so that you are standing side-on to the target.
Sight on your target.
Use BRA: Breathe, rest, aim method.
Note where the shot landed.
Keep practicing.

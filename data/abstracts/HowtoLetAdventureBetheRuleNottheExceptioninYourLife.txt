Regard normal life as an adventure.
Take a leaf from the book of David Grayson.
Learn to slow down, to be aware and to notice.
Set aside non-electronic time to begin noticing, listening, seeing.
Try to look at each event, person, circumstance as something imbued with the unknown.
Make a conscious choice to shift your perspective.
Cultivate spontaneity.
Stop scolding yourself for behaving like a child; the more you connect to that child within, the more you're freed up for adventure, wherever you go.

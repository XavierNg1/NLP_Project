Understand our "natural kick".
Start the soccer player by learning the angle kick.

,
The angle kick starts with the player approaching the ball from an angle.
Pointing the toe at a "4 o'clock" angle and keeping the leg slightly bent through the entire kick will "shorten the leg" so the player does not stub their toe.
Next we introduce the straight kick.

,
Stand upright and place your foot on the ground in front of you.
You strike the soccer ball with the laces in full, not just a part of them.
During the straight kick the leg travels straight back and straight forward.
Standing with the ball next to your plant foot, draw back your kicking foot with your toe pointed to the ground.

,
Your foot should go straight back.
Repeat both kicks in SLOW MOTION and do them over and over.

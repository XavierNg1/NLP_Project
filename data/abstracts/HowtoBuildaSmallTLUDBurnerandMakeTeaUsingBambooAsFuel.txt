Prepare a typical soup can, one slightly larger can, medium size nail, small nail, can opener and a hammer.
Aim for about a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) or 5mm gap between the cans.

,
Use the small finishing nail to poke one row of holes all around the base of the smaller, inner can.

,
Use the medium size nail to make holes in the ash grate (smaller can top).
Punch out the concentrator hole in the bottom of the larger can.
Flatten out the burs on the concentrator hole.
Use the metal from the concentrator punch out, as a space on under the ash grate.
Insert the larger nail and space up through the center of the ash grate.and lower the assembly into the smaller can.
There should be a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) or 5mm gap between the inner can and the concentrator hole.
The concentrator hole is on the other side, this image just shows that there is a now about a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) or 5mm gap in the heights.

We used a seasoned bamboo stick to make fuel.
This common brick happened to make a nice size fuel shaft when we split the bamboo into short pieces.
The can is full of wood sticks.
Place the inner can on two bricks with a nice gap between them to allow lots of air flow.
The working flame is about as the same height as the cans in this experiment.

,
Build a stove around the burner using bricks stood on end.
On another try, I added a small chimney made from an aluminium beverage can on top of the burner.
Tea Time!,
All in all, this small can of bamboo burned around 30 minutes.
I put a long section of drain pipe on the small can to produce a high draft.

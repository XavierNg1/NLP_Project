Be aware of how a normal "wave form" looks on an ECG trace.This will allow you to determine what area of the ECG represents one heart beat.
Identify the QRS complex.The QRS complex is normally the tallest part of the pattern that repeats on the ECG.
Count the space between QRS complexes.The next step is to determine the number of large squares on the ECG trace separating one QRS complex from the next QRS complex.
Divide the number 300 by your answer above.Once you have calculated the number of big squares separating QRS complexes (let's use 3.2 as an example), perform the following calculation to determine heart rate: 300/3.2 = 93.75.

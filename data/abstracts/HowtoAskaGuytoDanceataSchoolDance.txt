Start by taking a shower.
Fix your hair!,
Put on some cute clothes and add a little makeup (Not too much!).
Gather items for your purse.
Scout for your guy once you arrive at the dance.
Don't ask him to dance right away!,
Check that you're ready to ask him.
Walk over to him with a relaxed posture.
Once you have his attention, ask him if you could talk to him for a little bit.
Pull him away from his friends.
Don't beat around the bush, just ask him!,
Say something simple.
You don't have to dance to a slow song!,
Don't freak if he says no.
Put your arms around his shoulders.
Congratulate yourself!

Wash the carrots under cool running water.
Place a bowl on your counter top.
Hold the carrot between the thumb and forefinger of your non-dominant hand.
Place your vegetable peeler against the top of your carrot where the carrot is the thickest.
Push the vegetable peeler down along the surface of the carrot to its tip.
Now peel upward.
Rotate the carrot slightly and repeat the process until all of the peel has been removed.
Flip it over and peel the top.
Place the carrot on a cutting board and chop off the top and the tip of the carrot with a paring knife.

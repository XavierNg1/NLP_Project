Fold the wedding gown carefully, without creasing it.
Use acid free tissue paper to place between each of the folds of the dress to help prevent creasing or the fabric touching other parts of the dress.
Once folded, wrap the wedding gown one more time completely with the unbleached muslin prior to inserting in the box for storage.
Once boxed, slide your wedding dress packaged box under your bed or in a drawer or on the shelf of a closet.
While some people choose to store wedding dresses in specialty garment bags and store them hanging or laying flat, boxing your wedding gown is the best choice for long-term storage and preservation.
When you are ready to reuse the gown or remove it from the box packaging, simply reverse the process and be careful not to snag or catch the dress or pull too roughly when taking it out of the box.

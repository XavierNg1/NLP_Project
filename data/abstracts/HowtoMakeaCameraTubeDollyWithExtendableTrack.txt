Decide on how long you need your track to be for the shots you need.
Decide on the length of the separate pieces of the track.
Measure the distance between the legs of the tripod.
Add everything up and add a bit for testing purposes.
Look at your tubes.
Put two tubes aside.
Take the two tubes you put aside earlier.
Take what’s left of the two tubes.
Take what’s left and cut off tracks parts of the same length as the other parts.
You should have a few bits left.
Take all of the joints and saw open from one end to the other.
Take your plywood and choose a platform size for your dolly cart.
Take your test tube and two wheels with their bolts, screws and washers.
Before you start drilling for the wheels, keep in mind:

,
Put them a few cm’s away from the tube opening.
Don’t drill the holes opposite to each other.
Both of your wheels need to touch the track underneath, while keeping a good contact surface with the dolly cart tube.

,
When you’re happy with how your wheels roll, draw a straight line across the tube crossing through the good holes on your test tube.
Draw drill marks on this line a few cm’s from the (small!),
Take the tube parts of the dolly cart, the 2 T-section tubes and two dolly track parts.
Test on the tracks with your tripod, until you’re satisfied that all the wheels touch the tracks and roll as intended.

,
Glue the tubes together.
Put your cart aside and take the dolly track parts and the joints.
Take your plywood and make the platform.
From the rest of the plywood, make a narrow T-shape fitting the shape of the dolly.
Glue the plywood platform on top of the shock absorbing material.

,
Test and make adjustments if needed, before the whole dries up completely.
Decide on how many rails you can make.
Saw off pieces wood of 2x4 of about 10 centimeter (3.9 in) each.
Place the tracks and the dolly cart in position.
Use tape to temporary keep the pieces of 2x4 in place, or ask a friend for help.
Glue the 2x4 on the plywood.

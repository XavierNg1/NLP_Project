Purchase plate wall hangers.
Select your favorite plates that you would like to arrange on the wall.
Consider these possible design layouts as you're working out your arrangement:


One large plate in the middle with a semi-circle of small plates around it
Plates arranged in a star shape
Plates arranged in a circle
Plates arranged in order of size, smallest to largest or vice versa
Color schemed plates - blues together, greens together, maroons together, etc.
Think about appropriate hanging places in the house.
Hang the plates.
Finished.

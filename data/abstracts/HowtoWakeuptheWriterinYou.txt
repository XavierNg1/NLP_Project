The night before your "inspiration day", watch a historical movie and write down several stories that interested you within it.
Have a nice, non-writing day.

,
The next day, on a piece of paper, write down what's troubling at the moment, and/or things you have to remember to do.
Go outside, or open your window wide.
Turn on your favorite music, even with the window open.
For a moment, clear your mind of everything and enjoy the fresh air.

,
Now decide if you want to write a story about the person in the account you chose in their original historical setting, in a modern setting, in fantastic setting, or any other setting you may choose.
Now, in a notebook, make a list of possible characters.
Add your own subplots, many of them.
Give it your style in general.
Now go back and cross off all the subplots, characters, and personal touches you think wouldn't make the story good.
Feel free to take a few seconds/minutes/hours to daydream about how your story will go.
Start writing your story using your ideas as something to guide you as you write.

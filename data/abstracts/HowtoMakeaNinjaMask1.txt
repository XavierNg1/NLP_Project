Take a black or dark colored T-shirt and turn it inside out.
Slip the t-shirt over your head but do not pull it past your shoulders.
Fold both the top and bottom collar in so that the seams are not showing.
Take the sleeves and tie them behind your head.
Spread the rest of the t-shirt over your shoulders.

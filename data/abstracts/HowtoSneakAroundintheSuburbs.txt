Get the right gear.
If your parents already know what you're doing, great.
Once you're free, start heading out.
If possible, go through neighboring yards (make sure they do not have a dog).
If you have never sneaked out before, just start by getting a few friends and scare other friends.
Practice co-op skills with your friends in the backyard, e.g.
Try to stay close to objects, like walls.

The best joy of sneaking around, is going into places off limits (Do not go to any construction sites or broken down houses), just because you can.
Do not do anything illegal, such as breaking and entering, robbing a house, or trespassing.

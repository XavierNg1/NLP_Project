Seek the guidance of an experienced rider or instructor to supervise your foray into bareback riding.
Understand that it is important to try this on the right horse.
Focus on where you want to go with your eyes.
Look, leg, rein.
Keep your legs in the same riding position you would if you had stirrups.

,
Learn to ride balanced at a walk, trot, and canter in a saddle but without the stirrups.
Consider using a bareback pad, but choose one without stirrups.
Again, ride as you would normally.
Use a stirrup leather without the stirrups, strapped around the base of the horse's neck, to hold onto if you feel you may lose your balance.
Use just a halter/head collar to ride.
Sit forward on the horse.
When you trot, be stiff.

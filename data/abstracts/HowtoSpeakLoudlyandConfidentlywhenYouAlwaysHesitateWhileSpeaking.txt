Be prepared.
Go over the talk you are to give.
Once it is time to actually speak and use your voice skills, relax.
Bear in mind that confident presentation is all about your attitude.
Keep in mind that most of the time the audience is on your side and wants to hear what you have to say.
If you have prepared, tried your best and remembered the major speaking skills, then you will be ready.

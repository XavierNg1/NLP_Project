Take hormonal birth control pills.If you are a woman seeking to prevent pregnancy without using a condom, one of the most common options is to take hormonal birth control pills.
Have an IUD (intrauterine device) inserted.An IUD is a small, T-shaped device that is inserted through your vagina into your uterus (where it sits for the next number of years and functions as birth control).
Try other hormonal birth control options.Other hormonal options include a vaginal ring, Depo-Provera injections, and contraceptive patches.
Opt for a spermicide.
Use a barrier method such as a cervical cap or a diaphragm.
Opt for sterilization.One of the surest ways to prevent pregnancy is for either the man or the woman (or both) to be sterilized.

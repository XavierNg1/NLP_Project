Find a suitable fire area.
Find suitable tinder.
Don't use paper matches (the ones that look like thin cardboard).
Light the match firmly but carefully and cup your hand around it.

,
Light the tinder in more than one place.
If it does not burst in to flame but smolders, blow gently but consistently until it does.

,
Put bigger and bigger sticks or leaves on until you have a raging fire with little or no smoke.

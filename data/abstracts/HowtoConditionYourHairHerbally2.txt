Start with the base of a homemade herbal conditioner and work your way from the ground up.

,
A good base for all hair types is an organic lotion with no sulfates or parabens, for example anything with coconut, or shea butter is moisturizing, aloe vera is soothing, peppermint, and eucalyptus,and rosemary are cleansing and stimulating, and tea tree oil is anti-fungal and great for irritated scalps.

Now that you have a set base, you can add a few oils, because despite common beliefs you can use oils on any type of hair; it won't make it oily as long as you know which ones to use.
The most important ingredients to look at would be the herbs.

Search for a camp that works with disabled campers, especially those who are bed-wetters.
Confirm the camp arrangements.
Be clever in how you tell the child that bedwets how to approach the situation from here, while they are at camp.
Make sure the children know how to change their own diapers as they encounter them; both when they are wet and when they are soiled and wet and when they are not.
Consider asking the child to wear a disposable diaper to their camping gear as opposed to cloth.Having to feel as if you've wet your sleeping bag in the middle of the night, is completely unpleasant and may make the other children in the tent/bunk feel uncomfortable.
Have your child place the used diapers directly into a plastic bag which can be taken on different camp outings.

,
Let the bedwetting camper seek support.
Pack the child's backpack well.
Mention to the child that a few diapers should be reserved only to be used in an emergency and that you'll pack them in a bag and stick them elsewhere in the bag.

Start by choosing a place from which to purchase your hair products.
Determine what you hope to achieve with your hair.
Determine if you have specialized issues that need to be addressed such as dandruff, artificial coloring, permanent waves, ethnic hair, natural curls or thinning hair.
Always check labels!,
Determine the salon or storeâ€™s return policy.
Ask about any samples the salon or store may have available.
Ask if there is a professional that you can talk to even if you have found a product you may want to try.
Find a stylist with hair similar to yours and ask them what they use in their hair.
When you get the product home, use it at least three times or for at least three days.
If after three days the product is unsatisfactory, return it to the salon or store and tell a professional working there what problems you were having.

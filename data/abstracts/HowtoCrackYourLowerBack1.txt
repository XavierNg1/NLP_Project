Lie face-up, flat on your back with your hands by your side and your legs flat.
Bend your right knee, keeping your right foot flat against the floor or surface.
Allow your right knee to move slowly to the left and down towards the floor.
Turn your head to face right and rotate your upper body slightly in the same direction.
Stretch until you feel your back crack, or until you reach your comfortable height of flexibility.
Repeat the process by bending your left leg, and guiding it down and over your extended right leg.

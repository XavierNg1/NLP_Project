Practice chord transitions by focusing just on moving from Em to D2.
Strum the Em for one full measure.
Switch to the D2 chord after one measure.
Pick a comfortably slow, regular strumming pattern, counting it out as your practice.
Practice different rhythms as you become more comfortable, alternating the chords every measure.

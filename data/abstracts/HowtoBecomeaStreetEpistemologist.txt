Build rapport with the believer if you don't already know her or him.
After you've determined what the believer believes, ask how certain they are that belief is true.
Ask why they have decided their belief is true.
Based on their reason for belief, ask a question that asks the believer to think whether or not this is the true reason for their belief.
Give the person ample time to pause and reflect.
Don't expect the person to change their mind on the spot.

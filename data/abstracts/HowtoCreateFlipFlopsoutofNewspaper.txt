Choose your material.
Cut the paper into equal strips, about 1cm each.
Trace your foot on a separate piece of paper.
Cut out your foot tracing.

,
On another piece of paper, draw a flip-flop outline around your foot tracing, about how big you would normally want your flip-flops to be.
Take the strips of newspaper and weave them together.
Fold the outermost strip on side A so it is going in the same direction as side B and weave.
Trace the flip-flop shape onto what you have just created.
Cut out "feet" in the shape of your flip-flop out of the newspaper, at least 30.
Create your straps.
Tape the straps together so their ends line up, like attaching a pole to a tree for support, but leaving 1 inch loose.

,
Create a hole between where your first two toes would be.

,
Feed the straps through the hole, split them, and tape.

,
Tape the other ends on the sides of your feet where you chose them to be.

,
Create some 1" by 2" rectangles out of newspaper.

,
Flip over your very thin flip-flop and tape the rectangles around the edge, sticking out a considerable distance so it looks like a sun.

,
Place the stack of "feet" on top.

,
Fold the rectangles around the "feet" and tape.

Ignore every commercial, infomercial, or advertisement that involves improving your skin, most are expensive skin-wreckers.
Instead of purchasing that fancy St. Ives scrub, try baking soda to exfoliate your skin.
Instead of buying a harsh Neutrogena cleanser, try using the following by themselves or mixed together: honey, crushed regular aspirin, tea tree oil, sea salt, unflavored Greek yogurt, lemon juice, baking soda, or apple cider vinegar.
Instead of a synthetic Cetaphil moisturizer, try diluted apple cider vinegar.
Pay attention to ingredients.
If you have dry skin, avoid foaming and cream cleansers, even though they sound like they will help.
Always pat your face dry, and never rub it.
Instead of an extremely harsh, seriously drying spot treatment like benzoyl peroxide, dip a q-tip in a 2.00 bottle of hydrogen peroxide and dab on a blemish or popped zit.
Listen to what your skin wants.

Use the resultant displacement formula when units of distance are used to specify your initial and final location.
Connect the points based on order of movement and label them from A-Z.
Input the direction values for x² and y².
Compute the formula using the order of operations.
Use this formula when the problem specifies the object's velocity and time taken.
Input the values for velocity and time into their respective variables.
Calculate the formula once you have input the values into their correct places.
Employ a modified formula when acceleration is specified along with initial velocity and time.
Plug in the values where they belong in the formula.
Calculate displacement by performing the necessary order of operations.
Find angular displacement when an object travels in a curved path.
Input the linear displacement and radius values into the equation.
Divide linear displacement by the radius.
Know that "distance" means something different than "displacement.",
Understand that displacement is the difference between two locations.
Remember the words "back and forth" when trying to imagine displacement.
Know that displacement is measured using a straight line, not a curved path.To find displacement, you will need to find the shortest, most efficient way of measuring the difference between two points.
Understand that displacement can be a negative value, unlike distance.
Realize that sometimes distance and displacement values can be the same.

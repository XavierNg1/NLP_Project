Start by putting on a song with a good beat.
Start with the side-to-side move.
Sway right, left, right, right.
Add some arms once you feel you have the style down.
Try the "Cat-Daddy," another popular Dougie move.
Try the "Wheelchair" move.
Now do the Dougie "Fresh!",
Don't forget to be loose with your knees.

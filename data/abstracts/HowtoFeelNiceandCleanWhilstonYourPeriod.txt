Have enough supplies.
Always keep spare pads and tampons with you.
Talk to a trusted adult, best friend or sister about which products you should use, or stick to the regular ones for your age group.
Sometimes it can be embarrassing to talk to your mother about these things but she understands.
If you are scared of leaking as many girls and women are, change your pad/tampon regularly.
At night use a heavy pad or a nighttime pad.
Try to wear dark clothes if you are worried about leaking.
Dress comfortably.
You might get cramps, but it's best to get up and about to take your mind off it.
If you do physical education (PE) at school, try to participate.
Don't wallow about it and stress about your period.
Keep calm.
If you are scared that someone will hear you changing in the bathroom, go in there when it's empty or do it whilst a toilet is flushing.
Don't let it get you down.
Eat healthily during your period.
Try to have a shower everyday to make you feel clean and refreshed.
If you have discharge whilst not on your period, use a panty liner.
Does anything look or feel abnormal?,
Keep a calender or diary of when you have your period.
If you do stain a pair of trousers, wash with cold water and salt and rub then leave it to dry and try again.

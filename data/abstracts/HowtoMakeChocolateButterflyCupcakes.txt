Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Spoon equal amounts of the cake batter into each paper case, filling them three-quarts full.
Make the butter cream frosting.
Cool the cupcakes and then cut the top off each cake using a serrated knife.
Spread or pipe the butter cream over the cut surface of each cake and push the two cut pieces of cake tops into the butter cream to form wings.
Finished.

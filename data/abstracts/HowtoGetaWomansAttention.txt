Don't play games.
Be yourself!,
Make sure you aren't messing with a girl who doesn't want anything to do with you.
Let her make up her mind.
Don't give her the wrong impression.
Smile at the girl whenever the situation is right.
Make sure that when she talks to you, you continue the conversation.
Don't be pushy.
Sit at her lunch table.
Walk her home after school.

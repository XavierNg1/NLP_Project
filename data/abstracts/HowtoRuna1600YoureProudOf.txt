Begin training several months before your first race.
In the month before your first race transition to more speed-oriented workouts.
During the month before your first race you should also be doing some form of hill sprints once a week.
Even on off days you should always be working your core and upper body.
Eat well the night before and day of a race.
Hydration cannot be stressed enough.
Stay calm before your race.
When the guns goes off you should aim to establish your position.
Be extremely careful of running your first lap too fast.
On the second lap focus on staying with the front pack (only if that is your capability) keep the leader within close range and try to draft off other runners (running directly behind someone in order to minimize the effect of wind).
The third lap is where you make it count.
On the fourth lap slowly begin to accelerate.
If you are running side by side with someone else as you enter the last 200 m (1/8 mi) the sudden surge may be your best option.
After the race drink plenty of water but not too quickly.

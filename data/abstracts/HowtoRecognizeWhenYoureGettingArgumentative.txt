Realize that there can be a blurry line between polite disagreement, and emotional argument.
Watch out for negative emotions in yourself -- especially feelings of victimization, competition, enmity, or judging from yourself or perceived in others.
Take responsibility for your own feelings.
Be aware of topics that are more subjective, and how they can be subjective.
Make the conversation about them, not you.
Always de-escalate.
If you're in a meeting and it wouldn't be polite to excuse yourself, focus on listening and understanding.

Always remember that aluminum dust is both toxic and combustible.
Use a wood-cutting saw with carbide tipped blades to cut most aluminum.
Apply cutting lubricants on your blades or bits.
Reduce the diameter of cutting blade for better results.
Use a jigsaw if circular cuts need to be made in the aluminum.
Use clamps to secure your aluminum piece(s) and ensure your fingers are never too close to the saw blades.
Feed the aluminum through the blade (or the blade through the aluminum) slowly.

Recognise the symptoms of fainting.
If you begin to experience any of these, tell your teacher or another adult near by.
Your teacher should send you to the medical room, office or nurse, (depends on the school).
When you arrive at the nurse, don't feel embarrassed to answer her questions.
In the event of you actually fainting in class, don't get upset.
You will probably get sent home.
In the event you hurt yourself or your faint warrants a hospital visit in an ambulance, don't worry.

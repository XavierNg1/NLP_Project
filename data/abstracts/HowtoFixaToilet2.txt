Remove the top of the tank and lift up the floating arm.Find the rod attached to a ball that floats on the top of the water and controls the intake of water from the pipes into the tank.
Check the floating arm for misalignment.
If it doesn't seem to be caught on anything, unscrew the ball from the arm by twisting it counter-clockwise.
Check the flapper seal.If lifting up on the arm doesn't halt the running water and adjusting the floating arm doesn't seem to help, the problem is probably with the flapper assembly, which creates the seal at the bottom of the tank leading to the bowl and connects to the toilet handle by a rod.

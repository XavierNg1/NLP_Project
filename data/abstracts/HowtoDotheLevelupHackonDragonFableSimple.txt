Go to Falconreach and talk to Ash or talk to Sir Valance in Oaklore Keep.
Kill the first two (the only one on the map) after that, go to CE and type in your HP points as your value, the box next to the letters "hex".
Go inside the tree cave and kill the other ones until level up.
Type in 120 as the value in cheat engine and hit next scan.

Allow yourself to really feel your nerves.If you feel nervous frequently, try slowing down and letting yourself feel your nerves completely without a fight.
Unlearn nervous habits.Do you fidget or always bounce your leg when you're seated?,
Let go of your perfectionism.
Go jogging.
Regulate your sleep schedule.
Learn relaxation exercises.Instead of trying to relax by watching television or browsing the Internet, try a deep relaxation practice that has a physical effect on the mind.
Start a journal.When your brain is afraid that it won't remember something, it rehearses it over and over again.Your mind may cause nervous thoughts by bringing your focus to a worry or fear more than necessary.
Connect with others.Having a strong support system that you don't hesitate to use can do more than just distract you from nervousness.

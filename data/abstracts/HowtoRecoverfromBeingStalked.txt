Stop any contact between you and your stalker.
Tell your friends and loved ones what is happening.
Make sure they will not be able to find you on social media.
Don't relapse.
Keep a record of all the contact they have had with you.
Consider how you feel.
Challenge yourself.
Try cognitive behavioural therapy.
Remind yourself that the only power your stalker has over you is the power you let them have.

Grab the rack and set it down on the table.
Start off with the 1-ball at the front of the rack.
Make sure that the 8-ball is in the center of the rack.
Make sure the bottom corner balls are a stripe and a solid.
Place all the other balls at random.
Line the apex (the first ball) up with the middle diamond on the side of the pool table.
Make sure that the balls are tightly packed together.
Preserving the tightness of the rack, lift the rack from the balls.

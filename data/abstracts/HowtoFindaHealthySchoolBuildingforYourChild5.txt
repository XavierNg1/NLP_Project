If you see any of the above, or especially, if you find any issues that you feel directly point to mold or indoor dampness problems, you may wish to alert the school district (if it is minor) and select another school or healthy building for your child(ren) if you feel the problem is serious.
If your child is ill, seek medical advice from a physician familiar with mold-related illness (this goes beyond allergies).
Remember: what is most important is your child's health.

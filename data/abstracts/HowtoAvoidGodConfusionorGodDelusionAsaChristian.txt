Avoid sabotaging the faith and your prayer life: so avoid accepting and feeding your mind on non-faith from negative materials.
Expect, but do not accept the confusion, anger and low levels of respect from the media, some scientists, liberal theologians and modern-humanists.
Check into the confusion about "religionists".
Do not stumble over the "unbelieving-belief" of anyone who is not an example of believing God i.e.
Do not allow yourself to be confused or surprised by the "disbelief" or any ideas of people who do not believe in the things that you do.
Do not be awed by the anti-god, anti-religious variety of argument.
Don't hold your breath waiting for reasonable credit or respect for religion and the faith even though it is a constitutional right or a guaranteed freedom.
Appreciate Inorganic Matter as it exemplifies the weakness of believing (and saying) that life's origins were from non-organic material, ie: do they really scientifically know that: "Life produces life: they know nothing who do not know that.",
Consider: "Life is not scientifically known to come from non-organic sources... based on either faith in science or faith in God.",
Do not worry about why non-believers want to ridicule, write articles or sell books against believers and God.
Expect discriminating opinions as bizarre, biting or biased (skewed, slanted and sassy) portrayals about God and His own.
Hold onto the faith, hope and love that you have.
Use Laws of Science to Discover Faith if that helps, but recognize that the faith is not based on intellectualism.

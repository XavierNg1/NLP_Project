Stay outdoors until the shaking stops.
Stay away from buildings, street lights and utility wires.
If in a vehicle, stop as quickly as possible and stay in the vehicle.
If trapped under debris, stay calm and take preventative measures.
If you are near a big body of water, be prepared to face a possible tsunami.

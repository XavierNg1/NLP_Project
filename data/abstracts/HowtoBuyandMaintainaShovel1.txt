Decide what type of shovel you want.
Select the correct shape of shovel for the work you wish to do:


For general-purpose digging of holes in soil, a round nose (somewhat pointed) shovel with a blade (metal part) 8-12" long and 6-8" wide is ideal.
Find a shovel with the blade you want, and verify that it's handle is good:


Is the handle long enough that you can effectively use the tool without bending over?,
Is the blade strong?,
Actually buy the shovel.

DON'T dress to impress.
Be clean.
Be confident.
If you have a friend that you know at the school, don't ignore her or anything, but don't cling to her, as it can 1. irritate your friend and 2. make you seem very shy.
If you think you have a crush on a guy, don't do anything about it.
Although a bit odd, you need to discreetly find out about 5 types of people: 1. blabber-mouths/gossipers, 2. nice girls who could potentially be a friend, 3. girls who are not so nice to you, so you know to try to steer clear of them when needed, 4. nice guys who could be potential friends, and 5. guys who are not so nice so that you can stay out of their way.

Talk to people.
Be nice to everyone, don't become known as the new mean girl.
Do not criticize or talk about people behind their back.

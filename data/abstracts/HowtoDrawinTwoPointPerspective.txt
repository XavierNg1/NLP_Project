Get a fresh, clean piece of paper (any type will do).
Draw a line going from the left to right side of the paper.
On the recently added line, put two dots on it.
Somewhere in between these two dots, draw another line going straight down.
From the previous line that you drew, draw two lines on each side of that line.
Use your ruler to put it on the line that goes down from Step 5.

,
Slide the ruler over either left to right, and then mark it up and down inside those left and right markings you've previously made.

,
Repeat this action to the side you didn't do.
Connect those previously drawn lines (from the last step) to the dots.Erase the guidelines from the top and perfect your picture.

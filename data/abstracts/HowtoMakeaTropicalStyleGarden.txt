Find out your local climate.
Find out your soil type and build your soil up to suit.
Plan your garden layout, as well as functionality and practicality.
For hot, dry climates, ensure there is some established shade cover first.
Once the shade cover is established, consider some understory species.
In a windy climate, either hot and dry or temperate, install hedges, or other walls and screens to reduce the impact of strong wind.
Engage strategies for a colder climate.
Look at incorporating living sculpture in your garden, or using sculptural plants to make an impact.
Invest in brightly coloured banners and flags, sculptures (such as Buddha images, Polynesian, Balinese or other types of statuary) and water features.
Regular maintenance after the installation would be to ensure mulch levels are kept up and refreshed with new mulch (which can be done annually), as well as removing old palm fronds, flower heads and occasional pruning to ensure the new growth is prominent.

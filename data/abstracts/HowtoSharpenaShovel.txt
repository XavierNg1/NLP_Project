Gather the necessary materials.
Remove any rust from the shovel blade using the steel wool, emery cloth or rust remover.
Secure the shovel tightly in a vice or clamp it to the top of your workbench.
Locate the sharp side of the shovel by running your finger lightly along the top, then the underside, of the blade.
File the leading edge with moderate pressure, pushing the file forward and sideways, at a uniform angle.

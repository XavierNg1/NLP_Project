Think of why you want a private coach.
Do some background checks on the coaches.
Find out how much they charge.
Watch the coach teach other students.
Ask parents of other skaters that use that coach.
Find out what the coach expects form her/his skaters.
Lastly, make sure the personalities of the coach, parents and skater don't clash.

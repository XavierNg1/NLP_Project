Decide how tall you want your half-pipe to be and how wide the platform should be.
Use your template to make two end panels per quarter-pipe.
Use your template to make intermediate supports.
Cut several 2x4s into 3 feet (0.9Â m) 9in lengths.
Line the flat edge of the 2x4s up with the edge of the end panels (where the riding surface will be) and screw or nail them to end panels a few inches apart.
You will have to frame under the platform to support not only your weight, but also hard landings.
Once the framing is secure, you have to install the riding surface.

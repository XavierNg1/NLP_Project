Start tomato plants from seeds indoors 6 to 8 weeks before your last frost.
Purchase plastic peat pots or similar small pots for growing seedlings.
Fill your peat pot with the moistened soil mix of your choice.
Sow 2 to 3 seeds 1/4-inch deep in soil in each pot.
Store the containers in room of 70 to 80 °F (21 to 27 °C) until germination occurs.
Mist the seeds daily for the first 7 to 10 days.
Check your pots every day.

To make your oil blend, take your bottle and place in it up to 4 drops of essential oil for every 10ml of carrier oil you will be using.
Top up your bottle with your chosen carrier oil to the shoulder - this is the part where the bottle just begins to narrow.
Don't forget to label your creation!,
Store in a dark, dry place.

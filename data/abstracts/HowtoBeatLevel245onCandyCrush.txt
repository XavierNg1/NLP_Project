Begin by looking for matches that will allow you to create striped or wrapped candies.
Make color bombs to help limit certain colors on the board and improve your odds of making wrapped and striped candies.
Try clearing the candy bombs when their timers reach five moves.
Risk your moves on clearing any mystery candies whenever possible.
Focus more on making wrapped candies than making striped candies.
Focus on making wrapped candies in different regions of the playing board, if possible.

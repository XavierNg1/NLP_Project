Set up the integral to be evaluated.
Write the integral in terms of the binomial series.
Evaluate the integral using the Beta function.
Use Euler's reflection identity and the fact that Γ(1/2)=π{\displaystyle \Gamma (1/2)={\sqrt {\pi }}}.
Use the double factorial identity.
Expand the series.
Verify the series for the complete elliptic integral of the second kind.

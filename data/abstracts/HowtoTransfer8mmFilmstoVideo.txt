Determine whether your films are 8mm or Super 8.
Find a projector designed to project the type of film you have.
If possible, gently clean your films using rewind spindles and pulling the film slowly through a soft, lint-free cloth dampened with a little film cleaner.

,
Use canned air and an alcohol swab to clean the tape path on the projector.
Find a piece of bright white paper with no discernible texture to use as a screen.
Use a camera or camcorder that records to a digital format like DV or Digital 8.
Place the camcorder on a tripod next to and behind the projector and using zoom and focus, find a position where you can frame up the white rectangle on the screen with as little keystoning as possible.
Do a manual white balance on the camera with that white light on screen filling your frame and set your manual iris so it is bright without blooming.
If the projector has a variable speed adjustment, you should be able to tweak out the flicker on this white screen.

,
Load the sturdiest looking film onto the projector.
With a digital video master, you can now edit or transfer to DVD or VHS.

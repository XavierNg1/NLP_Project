To guide the classroom evaluation process, here is a list of background noise sources.
Ceiling level; the higher the ceiling level the more the room tends to a 'live' acoustic response, which can be detrimental to speech intelligibility and to attention spans in the learning environment.
Air handling systems; heaters, air-conditioners, etc.
Lighting; lighting can reflect noise if installed improperly.
Flooring; flooring should have material that improves acoustics.

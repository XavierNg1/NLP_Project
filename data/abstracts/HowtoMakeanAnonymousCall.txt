Determine if you want to make a land line or a cell phone.
Wait for a dial tone if you are using a land line phone (assuming you are not using a rotary phone).
Use a cell phone to make a call anonymously if a land line phone is not available.
Determine if your cell phone has an option to hide your number to the recipients of your calls.
Ensure, if at all possible, that the individual you are trying to reach has not implemented an available feature called "Anonymous call rejection."

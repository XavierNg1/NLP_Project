Dress for the occasion.
Shoes are important.
Don't take a bag/man purse, they won't be needed and things will get broken, essentials only; money, id, phone.

Now to the important bit the clothes!,
At any concert it gets really, really hot so you don't want to be wearing something that you're not going to be comfortable in.
Music festivals are often a big sweat pile, it sounds gross, but it's more fun when you're there.
No makeup.
Accessories are sometimes the norm at concerts, for techno/house concerts glow in the dark zinc and glow arm bands are always fun.
Keep it simple.

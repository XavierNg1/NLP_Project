The trainer squishes the smelly food treat into the space between the second and third fingers down near the palm of their hand.
Standing sideways with the target hand nearest the dog, the trainer waits for the dog to sniff her hand.
Then the food reward is removed from the hand and you begin again.
The next step involves having the dog transfer the target to an object.
Your shy dog should be confident enough about what he gets for targeting that you can try making a "new" person target.
Now the stranger has NO treat in her hand.
Be sure to take your targeting outside.

Make a bottle-shaped template.
Make five bottles of varying shapes exactly as you did the first one.
Draw a pencil line two or three inches up from the bottom edge of a sheet of 11 x 14" watercolor paper in "landscape" alignment.
Remove the templates and replace three tall bottles,Â allowing them to overlap a little and sketch them in pencil.
Activate your watercolors and make puddles on your clean palette of the three primary colors.
Paint the two vases in the foreground any color you wish.
Paint the background any color you wish.
In front of the bottles, put shadows being cast, as if the light was coming from behind.
Add your final touches.

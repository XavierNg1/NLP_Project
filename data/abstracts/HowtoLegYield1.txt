Know that the secret to leg-yielding is in timing.
Mount your horse.
Keeping your body straight, when the horse's outside shoulder is up (when you are rising), shift your hips to the outside as though you are going to stand in that stirrup.
Get the horse to take one or two steps at a leg-yield, then allow them to move straight and forward again.As the horse learns the signal, you will be able to perform a leg-yield by simply shifting your weight slightly to the outside

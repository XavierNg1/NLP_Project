Know your enemy - You are racing against 5 equal Nissan Skylines, so pure power will get you nowhere.
Technique - Up to the first corner, stay as close to directly behind the 5th place car as possible.
Win - Should you have won, celebrate by jumping around like a loon, hugging anything you can reach, and screaming.

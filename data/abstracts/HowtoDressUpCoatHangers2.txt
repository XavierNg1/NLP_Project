Use a plastic coat hanger for this.
Cut the wadding into a strip.
Wind the wadding strip around the clothes hanger.
Draw around the padded hanger onto a piece of paper.
Place the paper template against the fabric you've chosen to cover the hanger.
Pin the fabric to the padded hanger, one piece on the front side and the other piece on the back side.
Turn the seam allowance under once the fabric has been attached with pins.
Add a ribbon to the hook for embellishment.
Done.

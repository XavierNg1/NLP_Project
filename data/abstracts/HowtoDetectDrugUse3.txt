Buy a drug detection test when all signs point to drug use, or if you just canâ€™t tell but need your suspicions satisfied.
Administer the test without prior warning for the most accurate results.
Notify the individual of the drug test results to arrange any necessary follow-up testing, drug treatment, counseling, or even job termination.

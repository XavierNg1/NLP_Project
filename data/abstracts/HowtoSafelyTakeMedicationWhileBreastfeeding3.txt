Monitor your baby’s sleeping schedule.If your baby is much sleepier than usual or tends to sleep through occasions like feeding or other times when it is normally awake, it might be getting too much medication through your breast milk.Most babies should sleep most of the day and night (about eight to nine hours each day and eight hours each night), but will not sleep for more than two or three hours straight at a time.Babies are all unique, however, and some won’t sleep more than a few hours daily.

Pay attention to your baby’s feeding habits.If your baby suddenly stops being able to suckle as well as it used to, it might be suffering side effects from your medication.
Track your baby’s bowel movements.
Keep an eye on your baby’s behavior.Baby behavior might change in response to medication received through breast milk.

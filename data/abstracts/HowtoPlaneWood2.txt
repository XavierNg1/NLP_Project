Note that surface planers generally require pieces of wood with one flat surface.
Set the planer to your desired thickness.
Optionally, set the depth stop.
Turn the planer on and pass your wood through.
Pull up on the wood as it passes the rollers to avoid snipe.
Use ear, eye, and/or mouth protection as needed.

Stand with your back flat against a wall.
Bend your knees and slide down the wall until you are in a squat position.
Continue to slide into your squat until you are in a comfortable position without feeling any excess strain on the knee joint.
Repeat the test two more times and use the highest reading achieved.
Make a note of the length of time you were able to hold the squat position.

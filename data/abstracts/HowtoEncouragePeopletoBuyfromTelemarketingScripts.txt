Understand why people buy.
Extract those emotions out of your prospect.
Tell the customer what the customer really needs to hear to appeal to their emotions.
Think about all of your buying decisions.
Note that ALL buying decisions occur only when the prospect clearly sees the pleasure that they will gain or the pain they will avoid from parting with their money.

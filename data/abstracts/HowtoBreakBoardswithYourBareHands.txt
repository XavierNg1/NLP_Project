Secure it.
The break to start with is a palm strike at a 45-degree angle downwards, with the target board held at that 45-degree angle from horizontal at a little above waist height.
the board should be held with the grain parallel to your fingers.
Empty your mind.
Now focus on the target.
Strike through the target.
Concentrate on speed, not power.
Yell.
Give it your all.
Follow through.
If you do prepare mentally, and commit your strike fully, you will succeed.

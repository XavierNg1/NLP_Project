Create the Event Arguments Class:


Decide what you want to communicate with your event subscribers (other programmers who will attach event handlers to your event).
Declare the event delegate.
Declare the event itself in the containing class: use the event handler delegate you declared/decided in 2 as the event type.
Declare the event-firing method - a protected virtual method that has exactly the following declaration: protected virtual void OnEventName(EventNameEventArgs e){ if(EventNameÂ != null) { EventName(this, e); } } Use the event arguments class you decided to use in 1

,
Call the event-firing method you declared in 4 whenever the event occurs.

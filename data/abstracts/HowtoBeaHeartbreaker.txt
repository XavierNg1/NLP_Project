Have fun.
Set the pace.
Play the crowd.
Only reveal emotion that benefits you.
Show a little skin.
Flaunt your best features.
Splash on a little perfume.
Less is more.
Strut your stuff with the right shoes.
Use makeup to highlight key features.
Take care of your body.
Keep them wanting more.
Avoid personal attachments.
Move on.

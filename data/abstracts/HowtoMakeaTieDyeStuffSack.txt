Purchase a white laundry sack that is large enough to hold two rolled up sleeping bags.
Cover a large table with newspaper.
Put on some latex gloves and fill a bucket with dipping solution.
Section the sack by wrapping rubber bands around it.
Squirt dye onto the sack, using a different color for each section.
Allow the sack to dry overnight with the rubber bands on.
Cut two slits at the top of the sack, where the sack opens.
Thread thick yarn or thin rope through a safety pin or paper clip and tie.
Insert the "threading needle" into one of the slits and work it around with your fingers.
When the rope comes out the other slit, remove the "needle" and tie the two loose ends together with a square knot.
Spread the sack out on a table and lay flat newspaper inside it.
Using permanent markers, write and draw on the sack to your heart's content.

Make a simple exfoliating scrub with argan oil.
Combine a few drops of argan oil with a few drops of vanilla extract and brown sugar.
Apply this combination to your skin and work in using a gentle, circular motion.
Continue until your skin is mildly exfoliated, smooth, and moisturized.
Rinse with water.

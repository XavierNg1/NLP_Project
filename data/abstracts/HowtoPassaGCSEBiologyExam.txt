Switch off the computer, mobile phone, television and MP3 player.
Gather your notes, revision guides and also CDs.
Your school should issue you a Biology book specific to your exam board.
Write down key notes for your exam such as "Respiration is the break down of glucose in order to provide energy for your cells to carry out functions, carbon dioxide and water are the waste products.",
In some Biology topics you will need to know equations.
Always do past exam papers!,
When you have done the past exam papers and have asked a teacher or have a mark scheme to mark it, go back to the questions you got wrong or you did not understand.

,
In the exam there will be questions about science in everyday life.
Go over key areas which you do not understand.

,
Know the different types of variables as these are sure to come up on the "How Science Works" questions.

,
Once you have gone over the areas in which you do not understand and you are confident that you know the topic then do another past paper.
If in doubt always ask your biology teacher if you do not understand.

,If you want an A*, you will have to memorize all the Higher/process sections in your notes/book, make your revision thorough and always state the obvious in a data analysis question

,
Good luck with your exam!

Get an old pillowcase.
If your pillowcase has a folded-over edge, cut a slit along the seam but not on the seam, about 3 inches (7.6 cm) long.
Make an edge.
Measure out some rope or braid some yarn to be 3X the width of the pillowcase.

,
Tie a knot in the end and attach a large safety pin.
Tie both ends in a knot about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the edge and you have a sock bag.

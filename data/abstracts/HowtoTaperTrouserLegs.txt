,
Using pins or tailors chalk, mark the line you would like for your trousers to have.

Iron the trouser leg smooth, removing any pleats or creases.
Using a seam ripper, undo the side seams of the trousers up to the top of your taper area.
Check to be certain that the opened seam lengths match on all seams and on both legs of the trousers.

Re-pin the trouser legs along the desired seam line.
Cut off the excess material around half an inch from the seams.

Congratulate yourself and wear your new tapered trousers with pride!

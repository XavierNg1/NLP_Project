Find two matching bottle caps.
Place the bottle cap down on a sturdy surface.
Punch a hole into the bottle cap.Place a small, thin nail near the top of the bottle cap, as close to the edge as possible.
Poke a head-pin through the hole.
Consider slipping a few beads onto the pin.
Bend the shaft of the pin at a 90 degree angle.
Snip off the excess shaft until you have about Â¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) left.
Twist the shaft into a loop, but don't close the loop all the way.
Slip the earring hook onto the loop and twist it close.
Repeat the whole process for the other earring.

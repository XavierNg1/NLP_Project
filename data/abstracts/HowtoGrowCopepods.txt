Set up your refugium.
Set up the refugium with a habitat for the copepods.
Stock the refugium with live copepods.
Once you have obtained the starter culture of copepods, bring them home and allow them to reach room temperature.
Once the copepods are in the refugium, your only job is to let them grow and reproduce.

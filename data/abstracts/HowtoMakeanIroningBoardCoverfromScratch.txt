Untie the cord from underneath the existing cover (it is probably wrapped around a plastic toggle.
Zig zag stitch the raw edge.
Sew about 1 centimeter (0.4Â in) from the edge to make a channel for the string.
Assuming your cord is synthetic (most are) singe the end with a lighter, then attach a small safety pin.
Either tie off the ends, or use a piece of plastic with slits taken out of the sides (either make your own or use the toggle from the old cover) to secure the cord underneath.

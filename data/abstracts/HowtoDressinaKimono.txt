Purchase a kimono.
In addition to the kimono itself, you must have a juban, a koshi himo belt, a datejime, an obi makura belt, and white tabi socks.
Put on a slip called the "juban.",
Put on the kimono, making sure the back seam is centered.
After you have put on your kimono, pull the kimono so the it ends at your ankle.
As you hold the extra material about your waist, tie the koshi himo belt below the excess material.
Now take the datejime belt and wrap it around your waist over the koshi himo belt.
Put the obi makura into place and wrap the obi.

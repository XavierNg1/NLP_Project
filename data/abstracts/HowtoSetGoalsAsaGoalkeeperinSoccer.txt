Learning to set goals will give a keeper the ability to develop a clear course of action on where they want to go (performance level) and how to get there.
Make the performance goals realistic; goals that challenge you but are attainable.
Detail the performance based goals in short and long terms.
It is important to write your goals down on a paper.
Goals should be set for practice and for competition.
The next step in goal setting is to identify a keeperâ€™s support and feedback network.
The time for self-assessment is after practice and especially after games.

Long Term Goal: Dominate the box on crosses.
Recognize that each time a keeper steps on the pitch it is a learning experience, whether it be a practice or game.

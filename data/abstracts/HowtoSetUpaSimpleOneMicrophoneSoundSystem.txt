Install the two speakers, one on each side of the front of your audience.
Place your single cardioid microphone on its stand where you plan to place the person speaking but never in front of the speakers.
Connect the microphone cable to your mixer/preamp at input one.
Connect the preamplifier/mixer mono output to the mono input of your amplifier.
Connect the output channels of your amplifier to the left and right speakers.
Now that you're all connected, you can set levels.
When you've got your proper settings on the preamplifier, slowly turn your amplifier volume controls up until a good listening volume is achieved.

Strip the cable of its protective outside jacket about 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm) from the end.
Stripping the cable can cut and damage the wires at the area that we cut the cable so we want to expose about 6 more inches of fresh wires.
If your cable has the small string, make a small cut in the jacket of the cable, making sure not to touch any wires, and then use the string to pull towards the fresh end of the cable exposing about 6 inches (15.2 cm) of cable.
If your cable does not have the small string, make a small cut in the jacket described above and gently pull all of the wires together in one hand and pull the jacket in the opposite direction.
After choosing the correct pattern, choose the port on the patch panel you wish the cable to connect to.
Untwist the wires completely to the jacket.
Terminate each wire.Secure the cable to the patch panel with a zip tie if there is a slot or tab for a zip tie.Use a cable tester to assure that you correctly terminated all the wires.

Don't forget about the bathroom.
Use several recessed down lights or decorative surface-mounted fixtures for areas over 100 square feet.
Mount one fixture over the mirror to light a bathroom, but realize it can cause shadows on the face.
Use extra lighting in unexpected areas for both decoration and function.

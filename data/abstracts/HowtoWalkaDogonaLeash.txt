Use a standard length leash.
Begin at the point where your dog starts getting excited about going for a walk.
If your dog pulls you towards the front door, turn and walk the other way every time he pulls ahead of you.
Have your dog sit and stay at the front door.
Now have him sit and stay while you step out (dog remaining on the inside).
Now you are ready to start the walk.
You do not need to keep your dog very close to you.
DO let your dog sniff while on a walk.

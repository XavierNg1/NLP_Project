Give them opportunities.
Don't throw your assumptions about their gender identity at them.
If they seem like they want to come out, but are too shy, it's time to initiate the conversation.
Remind them that you love them and always will.
If the child comes out to you as trans, listen and avoid overwhelming them with questions.
After they come out, make some open-ended offers.

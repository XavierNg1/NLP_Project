As with all cities, you are going to need some stores.
Marketplace - Your teddies will buy their food here.
Furniture Store - Get some of that spare furniture that didn't fit the houses when you were housing the bears.
Spa -Even teddy bears need to relax sometimes!,
Hospital - Set up some pillows, as those are the ER Table-Beds.
Boutique - Set up a line of cardboard boxes, and put some clothes from Build A Bear or old newborn shirts on them.

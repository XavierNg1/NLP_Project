Prepare a 9x13 pan by lining it with aluminum foil and spraying the foil with nonstick cooking spray.
Place the chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and 1/3 cup of peanut butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl.
Place the butter, sugar, and evaporated milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
After five minutes, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the marshmallow cream, remaining 1/3 cup of peanut butter, and the chopped peanuts.
Unwrap the caramels and put them in a large microwave-safe bowl with 1 tablespoon of water.
Once the caramel is melted and smooth, pour it over the peanut layer in the pan.
If the remaining chocolate-peanut butter mixture has stiffened, microwave it briefly until it is melted and smooth.
Once set, remove the fudge from the pan using the foil as handles.
Enjoy!

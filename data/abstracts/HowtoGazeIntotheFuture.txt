Relax your mind and thoughts


Relaxing your mind clears out your thoughts, negative energy, and stress.
Lay down on your stomach in a comfortable position.
You will need a helper at this point.
With the ice cube on your neck, have your helper put on some soothing music, and try to fall asleep with the intention of gazing into the future.
Once you wake up, write what you saw in your dream in the notebook.
Signs of the dreams.

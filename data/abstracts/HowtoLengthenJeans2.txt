Gather your supplies.
Figure out how much longer you want your jeans to be and get some appropriate trim.
Measure the circumference of the bottom of your jean leg and 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) for the seam allowance.
Cut your trim according to that measurement.
Sew the narrow ends of your trim together using a Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance.
Turn the trim inside out.
Pin the top edge of your trim to the inside of the pant leg.
Topstitch the two together.
Repeat the whole process for the other pant leg.
Done.

Disassemble the entire clamp.
Hold the bar vertically.
With the bar still vertical (between your legs), slide the mechanism case so that the bar protrudes up through the hole on the end opposite the pad about 3 inches (8Â cm).Place the oblong hole in the leaf spring over the exposed end of the bar such that other end of the leaf spring points down.
Slide the "flat" coil spring over the exposed end of the bar and down to the leaf spring.
Slide the flat steel ratchet plate over the exposed end of the bar and slide it down to the flat coil spring.

,
Hook the hooked-end ratchet plate around the pin in the plastic ratchet handle.
Note that this step may require several attempts to master, but it really is easy.
Carefully slide the assembly down on the bar so that the bar just protrudes through the trigger opening.
Test the mechanism a little to see that the ratchet works.
Place the end pad on one or the other end of the bar, depending upon whether you want a clamp or a spreader, then insert the pins in holes at the bar ends.

A defender needs to run.
When you get the ball, quickly pass it.
Always look at the ball.
Never shoot the ball across the center.
Be secure as a wing back.
Remember to predict where the player will hit or dribble the ball next, you need to be very clever.

If your teammates need help but don't call you, use your common sense and put a tackle in hard.

Before you go, check if you are allowed to bring electronics.
If you're not allowed to bring electronics, come up with a good excuse.
Before you go to camp, get all set.
Once you get to camp, spend the first day getting to know everyone, having fun, and letting everyone get to know you.
On the second day, you might want to sleep in since you're going to be up late.
Get changed into a casual, but cute outfit.
Go around and invite people over to your cabin/tent.
After a bit, take requests for songs and pick a random one.
Once everyone is exhausted and some people want to leave, turn off the music and suggest a massive Truth or Dare game!,
If you don't want to play either of those games, bring out your cellphone and prank call someone.
Let everyone leave on their own.
Keep up your popularity and if you want, have parties every second day.

Check that your equipment is sufficient for your journey.
Make sure you have cast off all wires: electrical connections, phone connections, TV aerial connections.

On the single lever control, disengage the gearbox.
When the engine is running smoothly, look around for dangers and untie the boat.
With the single lever control in the neutral position, re-engage the gearbox.
With the stern well clear of the bank, slowly and calmly move the throttle to its lowest forward setting (or just move the throttle a touch forward until you feel the gearbox engage, then move back to tickover).

Move the tiller slightly towards the bank.
At low speed (perhaps very first forward "notch"), get used to using frequent small corrections (quickly "killed") maintain the boat in a forward straight line.
Once you think you have the hang of steering at the slowest speed, then allow yourself a little more power.Keep to the centre of the canal, except to avoid moored boats, or to get to a position to see around a bend or obstacle, or to pass a boat.
If a boat comes the other way, both boats should move gently about four feet to the right to keep the other boat on their left.
To moor, first slow down to a constant slow speed.
When nearly parallel, gently engage reverse gear.

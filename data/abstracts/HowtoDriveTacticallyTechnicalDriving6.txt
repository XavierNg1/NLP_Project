The PIT maneuver is a procedure which has been used by law enforcement departments around the world (this is also known by some as the Precision Immobilization Technique).
Before the PIT maneuver is performed, it is assumed that Car A is approaching Car B from behind.
Car A attempts to put the front quarter of the car next to the rear quarter of Car B.
At speeds greater than 70 mph (110 km/h), Car B requires not much more than a good strong kiss from Car A.
If Car A gives the initial tap with enough force, Car B's back-end should slide out.
Be prepared for Car B to try to drive off as soon as they have slowed enough to regain control.

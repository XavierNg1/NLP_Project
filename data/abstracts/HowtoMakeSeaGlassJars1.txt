Clean your jar with soap and water, pat it dry, then wipe it down using rubbing alcohol.
Mix 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters) of Mod Podge with a 1 to 4 drops of food coloring in a small bowl.
Paint the Mod Podge onto the glass.
Wait for the Mod Podge to dry, then apply 2 to 3 more coats, if desired.
Consider sealing the jar when you are finished.

Have traditional autumn meals.
Decorate your home.
Consider what autumn means to you.
If you have children, take them on Autumn nature walks, and tell them about the changes that they are seeing.
If you have young children, help them collect different coloured leaves, pine cones, acorns, etc. and make art projects out of them.

Nothing screams autumn louder than a bonfire.

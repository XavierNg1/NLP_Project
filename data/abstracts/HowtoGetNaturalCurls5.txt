Gather your supplies.
Start with freshly-washed, damp hair.
Part your hair down the center.
Take a 1 inch (2.54 centimeter) wide section of hair from the top of your head.
Run a comb through the section to smooth the hairs down.
Start rolling the hair using your finger.
Pull your finger out of the curl.
Secure the curl with two bobby pins.
Repeat these steps for the rest of your hair.
Wait at least three hours before removing the bobby pins.
Finished.

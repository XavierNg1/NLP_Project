Master a metronome-perfect sense of rhythm.
Learn the bluegrass standards.
Keep both hands loose and relaxed, especially in speedy sections.
Play with pick placement to get different tones and attacks on the strings.
Take short, precise strums instead of using big and expansive motions.
Build up your playing speed slowly, deliberately, and smoothly.

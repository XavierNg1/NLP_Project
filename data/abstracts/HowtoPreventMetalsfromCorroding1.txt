Prevent uniform attack corrosion by protecting the metal surface.
Prevent galvanic corrosion by halting ion flow from one metal to another.
Prevent pitting corrosion by protecting the metal surface, avoiding environmental chloride sources, and avoiding nicks and scratches.
Prevent crevice corrosion by minimizing tight spaces in the design of the object.
Prevent stress corrosion cracking by using only safe loads and/or annealing.

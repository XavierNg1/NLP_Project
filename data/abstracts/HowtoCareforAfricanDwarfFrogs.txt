Set up a tank for your African Dwarf Frogs.
If you intend to have an unfiltered tank like a goldfish bowl, 1–2 gallons (3.8–7.6 L) per frog is ideal so you will not need to change the tanks water every couple of days.
A filter is a must.
Use gravel or sand as a substrate, 1 inch thick (2 cm), or enough so when you push down with your finger you cannot feel the bottom.
Use live or frozen food, such as bloodworms, and brine shrimp.
Cleaning the frog's tank once a week will ensure health.
Provide hiding places such as small terracotta pots, logs, plants and moss.
Use real or fake plants.
Water should be around 70-75 F. Use mini water heaters if necessary with caution.
Young African Dwarf Frogs prefer to be housed in groups.
African dwarf frogs (ADFs) are often mistaken for African clawed frogs (ACFs), but the two are very different from each other.

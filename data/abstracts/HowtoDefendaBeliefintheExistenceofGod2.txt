Rub a glass rod with wool, or put a "lightning rod" in or near a puddle (tidal pool), let the ocean vents bask in sunlight: then could static electricity or an electrical flash of lightning like an explosion near a puddle such as a tidal pool, or sunshine piercing darkness cause the initializing of intracellular, mitochondrial energy creation, by "purposeless" living cells that would then begin regulated processes, respiring, digesting, and of course reproducing -- to somehow achieve "genetic programming of uniqueness" but still be the same in multitudes of meaningful ways -- programming of instincts and immune system, healing of injuries, nerves, nerves cooperating, nerves communicating, autonomic life processes (automated) like respiration, hundreds or millions of interrelated, interdependent reactions and systems,... Well, genes contain unique DNA, as coded plans.

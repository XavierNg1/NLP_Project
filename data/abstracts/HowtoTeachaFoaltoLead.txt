Introduce the halter to your foal when he is anywhere from three days old to a week.
Make sure that you buy a halter that will fit well.
Learn the first haltering lessons.
Once your foal is very comfortable with you taking the halter on and off without any help, snap a lead rope to the halter and hold it while he walks around.
Have a helper stand behind the foal as you snap on the lead rope.

,
Stand next to the foal's shoulder, so his front legs and your legs line up.

,
Have your helper give the foal a tap on the rump with their hand, or a small riding crop, and give a small tug on the lead while giving whatever command you want your foal to know means, 'go', such as a kiss, or the simple words, 'walk on'.

,
Do not make one continuous pull, or your foal will immediately resist.

Consider carefully why it is you do not want a surprise party.
If you still feel that you really do not want a surprise party, try to think of acceptable compromises.
Try to find out how far along your friend is in planning the party.
As soon as possible, talk to your friend privately.
If your friend isn't the one who spilled the beans, make it clear you know about the party.
Say that you're flattered or touched by the gesture.
Very gently, explain that surprise parties are just not your thing.
If you really don't think your friend will take "no" for an answer, say that you've already made plans for that day.
Suggest one of the alternatives, such as a regular party or a smaller party.

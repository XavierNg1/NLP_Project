Feel the beat of the music.
Stand on one leg with your weight slightly forward.
Bend your raised leg backwards from the knee.
Kick your leg out in front of you in time with the song.
Hop onto your kicking leg while bringing your other leg back.
Swing your arms along with your feet.
Smooth it out at a show.
Make the dance your own.

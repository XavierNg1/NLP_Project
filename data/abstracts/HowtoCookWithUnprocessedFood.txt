Buy organically.
Research organic recipes.
Most organic foods can still be used in standard recipes (after all, they had to cook this way in the past), but you need to know how they are made.
A lot processed foods (eg crushed tomatoes) are time saving conveniences.
Invest in a cook book that talks about food preparation (cheapest from charity stores or swap-meets / flea markets) or read how-to guides from the Food Preparation section in wikihow.

Many processed foods contain large amounts of salt, sugar or fats which improve the flavour.
Making your own preserves and pickles is satisfying, cheap, and makes a good reliable backup as many off-the-shelf products are full of additives and chemical preservatives.
Marinating food in herbs, spices, vinegars and flavoured oils are a great flavour enhancer if you find the ingredients become a little too similar in flavour.

,
Vary your cooking methods from steaming to include grilling, baking, smoking, braising (etc) to keep your meals varied and interesting.

Eat raw.

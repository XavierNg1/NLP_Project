Wear highly visible clothing, especially if you're walking during the morning, evening or night hours or in reduced visibility.
Avoid wearing expensive jewelry that might make you a target for robbery.
Walk with a partner whenever possible, or at least tell somebody reliable which route you're taking and when you'll be back.
Don't listen to a portable music player as you walk.

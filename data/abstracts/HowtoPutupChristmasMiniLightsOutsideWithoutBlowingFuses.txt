Limit the amount of attached lights.
You can get around this three string "limitation" by using inexpensive outdoor outlet power stakes.
Plug the mini-light strings into the outlets on the power stakes.
There seems to be no problem daisy chaining power stakes, so you can plug additional power stakes into these six outlets to give you even more outlets.

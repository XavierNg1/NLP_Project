Consider what direct and indirect demands you have been making.
Be prepared to evaluate your viewpoint of the situation as objectively as possible.
Recognize that often, men do not concentrate on the same details as women on a given conversation or situation.
Organise your thoughts.
Get your priorities straight.
Contemplate whether you feel the relationship has a future.
Prepare yourself to talk to him about it if you think addressing the issue will make it better.
Let him know that there is something you would like to talk to him about.
Start the talk with saying how much he means to you and why you entered into the relationship.
Connect the criticism to the positive things you said before by telling him something like "I really loved when you used to .. but lately, you haven't done that anymore.",
Be careful not to make it a nagging monologue, but address a certain behaviour and say clearly "This makes me feel neglected / unattractive / not appreciated / stupid / sad".
Show him how much this means to you and that his behaviour hurts your feelings.
Ask him to explain why he acts that way.
Keep the discussion on track.
Accept his apology if he offers one.
Take small steps with the changes.
Make changes yourself if the discussion has uncovered something you do that bothers him.
Praise him for taking more care of you if you notice he's making an effort.

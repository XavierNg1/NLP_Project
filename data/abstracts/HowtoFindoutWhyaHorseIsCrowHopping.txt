Know what it is.
When you take your horse riding, be aware of what is most likely to make your horse crow hop.
Always keep in mind the age, state, and physical ability of your horse.
Pay attention.
Try your best to stop your horse before it crow hops.
If your horse does crow hop, make sure you discipline them so that they know that what they did was not acceptable (I am a strong believer in discipline-NOT abuse.),
And lastly, make sure that all of your horse's equipment fits properly.

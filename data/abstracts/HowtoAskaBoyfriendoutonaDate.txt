Before asking him, think about where you want to go.
Choose an activity that both of you will enjoy.
Consider the method you'll feel most comfortable with.
If you feel really worried about how he will respond, try face to face.
Just relax.
Ask him what he is doing on the date you'd like to arrange the activity together.
If he says he's free, go ahead and ask him on the date.
If he says yes, that's a great idea, well done!,
If he says he is really busy, don't push it.
If he says no because he doesn't like what you've suggested, be ready with an alternative.
If he says he needs to think about your suggestion, take it at face value.
Don't force him.

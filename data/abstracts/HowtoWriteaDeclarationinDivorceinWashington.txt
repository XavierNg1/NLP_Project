Tell the Truth: A declaration is a written statement made under penalty of perjury.
Know Your Audience: As with any writing or speaking, it is important to remember who you are talking to.
Organize for Effect: Given the limited time a Judge or Commissioner will have to review what you write, organization is critical.
Be Specific: Colloquially, we are all used to making generalizations and over-statements in our everyday speech.
Stay Relevant: Being organized and specific are critical elements to a successful declaration, but staying on point and relevant to the issues at hand is just as important.
Don’t Argue With the Opposing Side: In family law more than any other area of law, it is easy to get dragged into a fruitless ‘he said – she said’ battle.
Write Naturally; Make It Easy to Read: While Judges and Commissioners are skilled at reading through to people’s intent, and aim to apply justice evenly to folks from all walks of life, they are still human.
Put Emotion Aside: Family law invokes some very emotional reactions from the parties involved, and often even the attorneys.
Draft, and Draft Again: After you write your first draft, step back and take a break, perhaps even sleep on it.
Seek Help: Having another set of eyes look over your declaration is even more important than re-drafting, and the two usually go hand-in-hand.

Do a dry run to ensure your tiles fit.
Mix up your mortar according to the manufacturer's directions.
Using a notched trowel, lay a roughly 1/4" thick layer of mortar on the countertop.
Lay the tile in place, then push it firmly into the mortar to adhere it in place.
Check for consistency as you work with a straight edge.
Cut tiles as you go to fit any problem areas.

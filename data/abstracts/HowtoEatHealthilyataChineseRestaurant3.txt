Stick to a healthy diet the day you plan to eat Chinese food.
Drink a glass of water before you head to the restaurant, and when you arrive.
Choose chopsticks instead of a fork and knife.
Avoid dishes with words like "house" or "combo" in the name.
Order from the menu rather than choosing to eat from the buffet.
Split dishes with friends or family, or take leftovers home.
Fill half your plate with steamed vegetables.
Watch your rice portions.

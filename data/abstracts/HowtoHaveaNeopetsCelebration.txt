For invitations you can send your friends online Neopets greetings, or you could go to the how to draw section and design your own invitations.
For games you could play some of your neopets video games with your friend if you have some, if so be sure to play fair.
For food ideas go to food shops and bakeries on the website.
As party favors you could give away clip on pets, (if you did the clothesline thing or hung them another way and you wouldn't mind giving them away but it's your choice and make sure no one fights over stuff.)

Use large fonts throughout your presentation.
Try to add as many pictures and animations to your slides as possible.
Draw charts, tables and blocks whenever you need to explain a concept in detail.
When you deliver your PowerPoint presentation, make sure you talk to the audience with the intention to explain your topic to them - not just to read what is written in the slides and finish off with the presentation.
A wonderful way to make your presentation interesting is to involve the audience in your presentation.

Know your plays inside and out.
Always keep your feet chopping forward with short, powerful steps.
Keep your spine straight to avoid injuries and add power.
Tuck your elbows in, hands rotated slightly outward, for maximum power.
Use short, powerful approach steps to close the distance on any far-off blocks.
Keep shoving your hands as you press, wanting nothing more than to see your opponent on the ground.

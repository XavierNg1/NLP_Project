Try to slip into the conversation that you've seen something really disturbing recently.
Explain to him that there are a few rules to obey (if the victim asks why, just tell him about a friend of a friend that didn't ask to leave and got rashes all over his body and has been having nightmares ever since.. you'll know what to do..).
Take him somewhere you have complete control over the environment, like your house.
Turn off cell phones, and every electronic device you can, except for your computer.
When you get there, the trick is quite simple.
Start with some general and simple questions, just to get him to see that it really works.
Move on to some more creepy questions, like


"What is your name?",
Once you see that the victim is really believing in it, tell him/her to do stuff, like:


"Take your shoes off"
"Draw a pentagram on your forehead"

,
If you get him to really believe in it, you can finish this off however you want.
At the end, don't forget to tell him that it was just prank.

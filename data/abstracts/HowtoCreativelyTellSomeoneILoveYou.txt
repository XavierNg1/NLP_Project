It's a good idea to know when the person is in a good mood already.
Don't look like you're trying too hard!,
If it's the first time breaking this special news bulletin, keeping it simple is actually the way to go.
If this is NOT the first time you've confessed your love to the person, you've got a little more to work with.
Start small.
Don't get your hopes up too high!,
Make sure you have some idea of where to go from AFTER your idea plays out.
Get help!,
Make sure, above all else, that you find a way to make your admission fit your partner.

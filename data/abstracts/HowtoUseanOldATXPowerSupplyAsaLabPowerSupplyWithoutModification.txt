,
Begin connecting LEDs to your load switch


Connect the load switch between 'Ground' and 'Power On'.
Attach your 10-Ohm/10-Watt resistors to a piece of prototyping board and bend the leads to avoid movement.
Test the box with an ohm-meter before applying power.
Here's a picture of the finished box:

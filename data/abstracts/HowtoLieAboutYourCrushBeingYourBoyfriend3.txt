Again, come up with a whole story, and stick with it.
If you know how to write like your crush, write a note in his hand writing saying, Will you go out with me, (your name)?,
If you prefer, tell a story if you really do have each other's phone numbers.
If you have an iPhone, thereÂ are websites where you can make fake text messages.
Now come up with casual stories about dates and you're good to go!

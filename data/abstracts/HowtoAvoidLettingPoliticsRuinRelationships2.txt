Ask yourself what you really hope to accomplish through political arguments.
Remember that politicians on TV attack each other for political points, not because they hate each other.
Ask questions instead of always proving points.
Keep your political positions to yourself, such as who you voted for.
Host any discussions or debates in person, not online.
Ask yourself if there are any political ideas or positions that are relationship deal-breakers.

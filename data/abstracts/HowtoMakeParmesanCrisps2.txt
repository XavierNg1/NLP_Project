Preheat your oven to 350°F (177°C) and line a lightly-greased baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place a tablespoon-sized mound of Parmesan cheese onto the baking sheet.
Gently pat the mound into a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) wide circle.
Make more 5 to 7 more mounds, spacing them 2 to 4 inches (5.08 to 10.16 centimeters) apart.
Bake in the middle rack for the oven for 4 minutes.
Allow the crisps to cool for 1 minute.
Remove the crisps with a thin, metal spatula, then place them onto your desired mold.
Allow the baskets to cool completely before gently pulling them off.
Fill the baskets and serve them as appetizers.

When you come to write your story, and you introduce the character, you will need to "establish" them.
Try to refer to characteristics and traits obliquely or indirectly:


instead of:
John was tall and thin, and wore his tee tucked tightly into his pants.
Say what the character is doing when you introduce them, and use that as a way to tell the reader about their personality:


instead of:
John was the anxious sort; he was always worried about trivial things.",
Once you've got your character established, you can add more details about them at your leisure.
Give your characters room to develop.

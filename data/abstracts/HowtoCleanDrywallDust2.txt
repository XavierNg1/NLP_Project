Take breaks to clean.Because the dust is so pervasive, remove as much as you can before it has a chance to build up.
Limit access to the work area.
Designate one entryway.Itâ€™s going to be difficult not to track dust in and out of the work area, so choose one entrance and seal the other entryways off.

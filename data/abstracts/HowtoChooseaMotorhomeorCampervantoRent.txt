Figure out just how many people will be traveling with you.
Always consider the next berth up when renting a motor home.
Decide on just how many facilities you would need and how self sufficient you would expect to be.
Think about how long a trip you will be taking and how long you will be actually traveling as opposed to how much time you might be spending at a campsite.
Understand that some areas and roads have restrictions when it comes to sizes and widths.
Check camping ground and holiday parks to see if they can facilitate the size of your vehicle beforehand.
Make sure you rent accordingly to your budget.
Booking well in advance often ensures a lower rate.
An absolute must: Check the terms and conditions thoroughly.

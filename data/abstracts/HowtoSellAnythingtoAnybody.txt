Dress to suit the circumstance.
Be punctual.
Attract the specific kind of customer you want.
Know your customer.Being aware of the circumstances and desires of whomever you're selling to is just as important (if not more so) than what you know about the product itself.
Appraise your chances with the customer.
Actively engage with your customer.Once you've met up with your prospective customer, you should engage with them as if they were a casual friend, rather than purely as a business associate.
Put the customer first.Even if your ultimate goal is to sell a product, you can only maximize your chances of that if you put your customers needs before your own.
Know your product.
Frame the product as part of the customer's ideal lifestyle.
Close the deal.

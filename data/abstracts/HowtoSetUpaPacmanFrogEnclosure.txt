First start off with getting a 10 gallon (37.85L) aquarium.
Put a background (if you want one) on the outside back of the enclosure.

,
Now fill the aquarium with two inches of Eco Earth, Bed a Beast or similar - they're both the same thing, just different brands.
Then put in on one third of the aquarium with pre-soaked moss and mix them both.
Next put in your shallow water dish in on one side of the enclosure.
Put some fresh spring water, RO water, or distilled water in its water bowl.

,
Dampen the substrate with a sprayer or spritzer and always be sure to have a damp but not saturated substrate as these Leptodactylidaes  need a high humidity.

,
Put in some plants - artificial or real, ask a pet shop owner for good species of plant - to hang over the water bowl so the frog doesn't feel out in the open.

,
Next put a log on the side of the wall that leads from the dry side to the moist side.
Now put a medium size rock in a corner on the dry side.

,
Put a thermometer and a humidity gauge on the side of the tank and check that both are at the right levels (The temperature should be kept around 82ºf (28ºc) during the day, dropping to around 78ºf (25ºc) at night.
Put your frog in.

,
Put the lid on and put your UVB light on the screen top.
A 10 gallon (37.9 L) aquarium should be sufficient for an adult specimen.
Now put on a heat pad so that during the night the frog tank can stay at the right temperature.
You should get a background that covers the back and both sides of the cage.
You should put in two inches of the correct substrate.
Put in a water dish.
Now put your RO or distilled water in the water dish and make sure you don't fill it up to high or your frog can drown (mid shoulder height is acceptable).
Put in a hiding place for your frog.
Put in some fake plants.
After all this is done make sure the pacman frog still has enough safe areas to move around in and it doesn't seem too small that it could stress out the frog.

,
Put in a thermometer so you will know how hot it is in the enclosure and know if it the right temperature for the pacman.

,
Put in a hydrometer to check the humidity and to see if it is humid enough for the pacman.

,
Close the enclosure.

,
Put on a heat lamp (if necessary) so you can get the temperature to rise in the enclosure if you need it too.

,
Put in your pacman and enjoy.

See your physician for a urine "ACR" to test your kidney function.The urine "ACR" stands for the "albumin to creatinine ratio.",
Understand that you may receive a "random" urine test or a 24-hour test.If you and your doctor opt for a "random" sample, you will be asked to submit a one-time urine sample to the lab which can give a snapshot view as to the amount of protein present in your urine at that time.
Ask your doctor for a "urinalysis" to gain additional information about your kidney function.In addition to the more basic test of looking for protein in your urine, a "urinalysis" also examines your urine under the microscope checking for any red blood cells, white blood cells, or other unusual things that may be present in your urine.
See your physician for a blood test to evaluate your kidney function.There are a few different things that can be measured in a blood test that can provide valuable information to your doctor about your kidney function.
Interpret the significance of your creatinine and eGFR results.Creatinine is a waste product that accumulates in the blood.
Receive BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine clearance tests.BUN is another waste product that can build up in the blood when the kidneys are not functioning adequately, and is hence used as a potential sign of kidney disease or acute kidney impairment.
Have your blood pressure measured.In addition to receiving both urine tests and blood tests, if your doctor suspects that you may have a kidney problem (either acute or chronic) it is key that you receive regular blood pressure measurements as well.
Get tested for diabetes.
Receive further kidney evaluations as necessary.If your urine and blood tests show evidence of kidney disease, you may need to proceed with further investigation such as imaging and/or a kidney biopsy.

Begin by thinking of praying such as:"How much You, Oh God, have done for me from day to day up until this very moment.
Think of Jesus' life:"I exalt You for taking the form of a man to die on the cross in atonement for my sins and for rising again that I might share in Your life".

,
Let awareness soak in and enable you:"I praise You for day to day life, and realizing that You gave Yourself brings gratitude for Your love that permeates my life.",
Start naming qualities or attributes for God, eg.
Thank Him: "I thank you for all things (huge and tiny) in my life; You have provided all things for my good.
Utilize creation for your praising God, e.g.
Let Him take over as you express your deep love for God and "I praise You, Lord, for inhabiting the praise of Your people" !,
Do things for others as praise as Jesus said "What you do to the least of these little ones you do to me.",
Praying within His will and praising him work together for the ultimate success in your prayer life.

,
Make a prayer journal because you will be blessed when you see the progress of your prayers and praises in all areas of life.

,
Praise Him through the storms in your life: "I praise you, Father God, that you are and will always be there for me, to help and give me peace and comfort.
Put on some Christian music and worship God wherever you are.

Decide if your circuit is wired in series or parallel.
Find the voltage of the circuit.
Solve for the current of the circuit.
Calculate the resistance of the circuit.
Understand the “Table Method.” The table method is a great way to calculate the resistance of different resistors in the same circuit.

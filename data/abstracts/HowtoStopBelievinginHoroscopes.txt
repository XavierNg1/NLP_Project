Look up the history of horoscopes.
Consider how the positions of stars have changed since horoscopes were first formed.
Consider how the planet positions change constantly.
Note that sun-sign astrology has some severe limitations when the science is applied to it.
Realize that horoscopes are just for fun and do not mean anything.
Think about the personality traits revealed in the signs.
Think about any previous loves, and the people that you get along with very well.
Think of how silly the concept really is whenever you read a horoscope.
Go cold turkey.

Start by gathering the information you need.
Write a rough draft that you have absolutely no intention of being your final copy.
Plan it out carefully.
In the top right corner put the date you're writing the letter.
Think of the first paragraph as the greeting, like a hand shake.
Give each complaint its own paragraph.
End on a positive note.
Sign it, then under your name add your contact information.
Leave the letter alone and let it simmer for a day or so.
When you're satisfied, send the letter.

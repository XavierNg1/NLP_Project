Start by thinking about your personal health.
Look at things or use things that remind you of your time abroad to help bring back fun and exciting memories.
Be honest with your family if you think you will need time to decompress from a trip and readjust yourself.
Be realistic with your schedule.
Enjoy the things that you missed while you were away.

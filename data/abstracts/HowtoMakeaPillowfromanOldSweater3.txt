Cut two pieces of fabric that are 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) larger than your pillow form.
Choose a sweater, then cut it along the top and sides to separate it.
Pin the fabric to the wrong side of each sweater panel.
Sew around the edges of both panels using a Â¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance.
Trim the sweater down to fit the fabric squares.
Pin and sew the two panels together, leaving behind a gap along one edge.
Turn the pillowcase inside out, and insert the pillow form.
Sew the gap shut.

Choose the type of car you are interested in, then become familiar with its operation, the type of equipment it comes with, and the general history of it.
Check online for customer feedback on the models you are looking for.
Look for cars that have features you need to suit your purposes.
Check the prices of comparable cars at local used car lots, the want ads in the local newspaper, and any other sources you have.
Be model specific when you have chosen a car.
Learn what you can about the car's history when you go to check it out.
Look the outside over.
Take a look in the trunk, checking to be sure a usable spare tire, jack, and tire tool are there.
Look under the hood.
Look at the "creature comfort" features inside the car.
Take a test drive.
Take the car out on a street that will allow you to put it through some paces.
Bring the car back to the seller's home and park it.
Look at the tail pipe for water or oil droplets that may have accumulated there, as well as any black, soot material inside the pipe.
Take a look underneath the car.
Look at the results of these inspections, and ask honest questions to the seller, both in terms of your observations and what he or she thinks is the cause of them, and their willingness to work with you to offset the cost of possible repairs in negotiating the price of the car.

If you want to emulate the start of Marina's look, I.E from Hollywood to Hermit the Frog, try integrating it a little each day into your style.
If you want to go for a striking look, why not try a new hair colour just like Marina?,
If your Electra Heart is beating wildly for Marina's new vintage look, then why not try thrift stores or charity shops?,
Always try to add a little bang to your outfit, be it with a cute cartoon purse or a sweet necklace.
Marina's more casual look seems to be made of Hipster essentials, such as thick black tights, cute little skirts and high waisted jeans, but remember not everyone has the same body shape.
Make up wise, try to stay as classic as possible.

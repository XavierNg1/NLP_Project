Paint one coat of clear nail polish on the nails of one hand.
Fold a sheet of paper in half and place that hand on it.
Open a jar of glitter and take some with your fingers and sprinkle it onto your nails.
Use the fold of the paper to pour the excess glitter back in the jar.
Apply another coat of clear nail polish to seal the glitter in.

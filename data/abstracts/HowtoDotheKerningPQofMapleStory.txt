Enter the Dimensional Mirror.
When you are in the lobby, find a party.
When you get in, walk all the way to the right.
Collect coupons by killing the Alligators (called Crocos in Maple Story) in the stage.
In stage 2, there are 4 ropes to hang on.
In stage 3, there are 5 platforms.
Stage 4, you have to kill all the Curse Eyes in the map.
In the 5th ("Last") stage, kill the King Slime.
Repeat the process until you are bored, obtained the Squishy Shoes, you run out of potions, obtained the King Slime card, or when you have collected 15 Smooshy liquids.

Connect your DTV converter box to a good antenna.
Use the remote control for your DTV converter box to enter the "channel scan" mode.
Start the "Scan" function.
After the full autoscan has completed, use the "channel up/down" buttons on your DTV converter box remote control to verify that all the channels you expect to see are there.
If not all the channels appear, follow the "tip" below regarding adding of channels using a "channel add scan" or "manual tuning" function to add channels to the list of memorized DTV channels that your converter box stores.

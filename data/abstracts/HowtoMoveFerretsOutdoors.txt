Create a ferret escape-proof environment which is not the easiest task in the world.
You could simply build a hutch, but try to go one step (a giant one) further, and give the little rascal a true habitat.
Your materials will be hardware cloth, 2x2's and 2x4's.
Put your frame together as though you were building a small building or shed.
Perches should really be built, at various levels from the ground and connected by your paths; put some in sun and some in shade, so that they are inviting, year 'round.

They will also need small boxes for denning; this is where they'll sleep and feel safe.
If you choose, you can run pathways to a covered area of the pen, and place their boxes there.
Don't forget the litter boxes, except that these can simply be boxes of sand.
Food and water must not be forgotten, of course.
Start your ferret's residence outside, in the middle of spring, when chance of frost is completely past.

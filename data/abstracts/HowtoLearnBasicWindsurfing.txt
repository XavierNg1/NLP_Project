Knowing your kit is helpful as when others give you advice you need to know what they are talking about.
Remember that when starting the daggerboard, it should be down at all times.
Know that there will also be foot straps and a deck plate to hold the rig on.
Push the board out into deep water until the fin is clear of the bottom.








,
Get a sense of the wind direction, and maneuver the board so that the sail is downwind of the board.








,
Swim or walk to the upwind side and clamber onto the board - elegance is not required!,
Raise to your feet at a slow pace.
Bend your knees slightly and pull the sail up from the water with the uphaul, hand over hand like hauling in a rope.
Take hold of the mast with both hands and let it swing.
Practice steering(called Center of Effort Steering) in the "safety" position.
Start moving.
Pull with the stern wards hand (the back hand) to accelerate - let it out to slow down.
Relax!,
Tilt the mast, from the safety position, towards the stern to turn the nose of the board upwind (behind you) or towards the bow to turn downwind (in front of you).








,
Step around the mast, as the nose comes around, to get to the other side.
Enjoy yourself!

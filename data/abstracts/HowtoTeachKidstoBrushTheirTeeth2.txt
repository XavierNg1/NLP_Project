Remember “2min2x.” The accepted goal for tooth-brushing, for both children and adults, is two times daily for two minutes each time.The odds are probably good that even if you do brush your own teeth twice daily, you don’t do it for two minutes each time.
Use toothpaste properly.
Teach proper brushing technique.
Let your kid take over when ready.
Be patient.

Grip the club with your dominant hand on the shaft near the hosel (the part of the club that connects the head with the shaft) with the clubface facing skyward.
Hold the ball a few inches over the clubface and drop the ball on the face.
On the next try, let the ball bounce more than once, keeping the clubface directly under the ball.
After you develop more than a few bounces, move your hand further up the shaft to the grip end like Tiger.
Learn to stop the ball on the face.
Try to get the ball to rest on one dimple.

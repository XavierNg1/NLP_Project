Clean and peel as many potatoes as you need based on the amount of chips you want to make.
Slice potatoes as thinly as desired, placing slices in a large bowl of water to remove excess starch and prevent browning.
Fill 1/3 of a large kettle with the oil of your choice and heat to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius).
Transfer potato slices from the large bowl of water to a colander.
Submerge potato slices in heated oil, cooking until they appear white and matte.
Increase the oil heat to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) and re-submerge chips, cooking in batches until they are golden and crisp.

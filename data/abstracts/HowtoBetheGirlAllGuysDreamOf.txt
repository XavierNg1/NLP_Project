Be yourself!,
Wear whatever you want.
Again, wear what you wish.
Smile and laugh around him, because that way you'll seem approachable.
Don't be unkind.
Look at him a lot and when he catches you give him a dazzling smile and then look away.
After a while check on him.
Try not to use curse words around him.
Make eye contact!,
Don't concentrate too hard on him or become too clingy.

Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C) and prepare a bundt pan.
Add both the cake mix and brownie mix into a large bowl.
Whisk in the eggs, water, and vegetable oil.
Pour the batter into the bundt pan, and bake it for 50 to 55 minutes.
Let the cake cool.
Heat the heavy whipping cream in a saucepan over medium heat until it is just short of boiling.
Add the chocolate chips, and wait 5 minutes.
Whisk the heavy cream and chocolate together for about 1 minute.
Pour the ganache over the top of the cake.

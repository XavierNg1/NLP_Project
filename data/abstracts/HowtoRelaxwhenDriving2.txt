Give yourself plenty of time.
Set up your car.Preparing your car for your drive before you get behind the wheel can help you relax when driving.Before you get in, make sure that you have adjusted your controls and set the car up for your drive.
Turn on relaxing music.Some research suggests that listening to classical, pop, or other downbeat music while you are driving can calm you down.So turn off the rock and rap and put on some pop or R&B to relax when you are driving.
Put your electronic devices away.
Talk to your passengers.

Buy a Mamod engine.
Decide upon either one that remains in a fixed position, known as a Stationary Engine or one that moves along the ground known as a Mobile Engine.

,
Know that there are some basic things you now need to do starting with "getting it running" like getting water and fuel.

,
And always - ALWAYS take your alcohol or dry fuel engine outside to run it.
Make sure that water is to be carefully poured into the boiler through the hole in the top where the Safety Valve is located.
On the boiler back plate, either look at the Water Level Glass or as with older engines, the water level hole, and stop filling when the correct level is reached.
If you have a Water Level Plug type, this is the time to screw it, finger tight, back into the hole.
Fuel next.
The liquid you need here is Methylated Spirit or methyl alcohol.
Now you are nearly ready to fire up.
Now check that your Safety Valve (and Water Level Plug) is tight and your water level is correct.
Place the burner close to the engine and ready to insert under the boiler.
Gradually the water will begin to get hot and then raise a head of steam.
Everything should now be running smoothly and you can let it run until the fuel runs out.
When you have had enough of running the engine, drain the water and just put it away - clean it if you want to but it's not absolutely necessary.

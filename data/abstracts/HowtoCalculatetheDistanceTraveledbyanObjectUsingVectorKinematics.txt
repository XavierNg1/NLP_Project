Determine the angle which the bullet is fired, relative to the ground.
Determine the initial (starting) velocity of the bullet as soon as it leaves the barrel of the gun.
With a writing utensil and paper, construct an x-y coordinate system with the origin located at the point where the bullet leaves the barrel.

Using trigonometry, determine the initial velocity in the x/y-direction.
Using the equation y= yo + voy – ½ gt2, calculate the time it takes for the bullet to reach the ground.
Calculate the distance travelled by the bullet.

Start with a single sheet of square paper, with each side measuring approximately 3 inches (about 7.5 cm).
Fold it in half, and make a crease along the fold.
Unfold the previous fold.

,
Fold in the right and left sides of the square to meet the crease you just made, to make a rectangle.
Flip your rectangle over.

,
Make a diagonal fold where the top right corner meets the left side of your rectangle.
Turn your paper upside down.

,
Make another diagonal fold where the top right corner meets the side of this shape.
Make a diagonal fold where the top corner meets the right corner of the parallelogram.

,
Make another diagonal fold where the bottom corner meets the left corner of the parallelogram.
Flip this square over.

,
Fold the square in half, making a crease that goes perpendicular to the cupboard fold visible on the square.

Congratulations!,
Make thirty units.
Start putting the units together.
Start with two units of different colors.
Pick a unit of a different color (pictured red) next and put its tab in the 'orange' pocket, while also inserting the 'yellow' tab in the 'red' pocket.
Notice that each unit has two pockets.
Take a new (red) unit as before, and put its tab in the second orange unit's pocket, also putting the yellow tab in the red unit's pocket.
Continue adding pyramids in this manner until you have five pyramids that all meet at a point.
Keep adding pyramids to your stellated icosahedron, making sure that there are never more than five pyramids meeting at a point.
Proceed, making sure that no more than five pyramids meet at a point, and your model will take shape.
Hooray!

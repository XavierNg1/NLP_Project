Chop your potatoes into long fries, roughly the thickness of your index finger.
Optionally, soak the potatoes in cold water for 1-2 hours.
Get a deep pan and coat the bottom with three inches of vegetable oil, heating to 325F degrees.
Fry the chips so they are covered completely in hot oil for 2-3 minutes.
Let the chips cool to room temperature before frying the second time.
Make sure your fish is completely thawed out.
Increase the temperature of the oil to 375F.
Whisk together your batter in a bowl and set aside for 15 minutes in the fridge.
Toss the potatoes back into the hot oil for 2-3 minutes to finish cooking.
Lightly dredge the fish in flour to help the batter stick.
Dunk a piece of fish in the batter with tongs, coating completely.
Still holding by the tail, dip the fish in the hot oil, swirling it around until the outside sets.
Cook each fish until golden brown, roughly 2-3 minutes.
Drain everything on newspaper (or paper towels) and liberally add salt.

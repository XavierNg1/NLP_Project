Devote plenty of time to training.
Use your rabbitâ€™s favorite treats.
Get your rabbit in position for training.
Have a plan.
Give your rabbit a treat immediately when your rabbit does something you want to reward.
Keep providing the treats until your rabbit responds correctly nearly every time.
Consider using clicker training.
Wean your rabbit off the treats gradually.
Reinforce the training as necessary.

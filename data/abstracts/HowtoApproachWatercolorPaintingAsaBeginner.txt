Take a piece of watercolor paper, tape down the edges firmly on a drawing board.
You can get a very smooth background light color by going wet into wet.
Try letting it dry until the sheen is gone but the paper is still damp.
Use a very simple subject at first that has broad areas of color.
You can tell when the paper is completely dry because it will no longer feel cool.
You can use a watercolor block that's gummed on all four sides like the top of a writing pad instead of taping your paper down.
Try using a big wash — lots of light color — in an area.
Try drawing on the paper with a white colored pencil, wax crayon or candle end to see the lines show up when you watercolor over them.

Try cutting out shapes in masking tape and painting inside those shapes to get exact shapes.
Always paint watercolor paintings by painting the dark areas first and paint around the light areas.
Try "glazing.",
Read books and articles on watercolor and try the ideas in them.

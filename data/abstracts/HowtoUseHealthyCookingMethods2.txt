Buy a metal steaming basket.
Clean delicate vegetables, such as green beans, broccoli, cauliflower or pea pods in a colander, and allow the excess water to strain off for a few moments.
Place the steaming basket in the saucepan and open it up.
Place chicken or fish in the steaming basket for an extremely healthy way to eat your meats.

Purchase an awning kit.
Select a location for your awning.
Use a felt tip marker to mark where the ends of the awning will be.
Draw a straight line between the two marks.
Place the two end mounting brackets approximately three inches inside the end marks.
Place the third mounting bracket directly in the middle of the chalk line.
Drill holes for the mounting bracket screws.
Coat the provided screws in a water-tight sealant.
Attach the mounting brackets.
Hang the camper awning over the mounting brackets.
Extend the awning.
Make torsion adjustments.
Consider purchasing a “deflapper.” This part will be installed halfway down the awning and will reduce flapping.
Skew your awning slightly.

Choose your table's size and shape.
Measure the middle of your sheet of plywood by taking a measurement to determine the intersection between the midway point of the length and midway point of the width of the table.Take a length of twine that is half the length of the table, plus a small amount of extra twine to connect the twine to the screw at 1 end and a pencil at the other end.
Use the pencil to draw a radius to both ends of the board.Cut along the line with a saw.
Sand the top of the plywood so it has a surface that will not catch on cloth.
Cut a sheet of 2 inch (50 mm) foam so that it is 3 inches (76 mm) longer and wider than your table.
Spray the surface and the side edge of the plywood with an even coat of adhesive.Spray a light coat of adhesive over the foam, using half as much spray glue as you did to affix the foam to the plywood.
Take your large sheet of green velvet, velveteen or very fine felt.
Grab the fabric gently at a corner, pull it around to the bottom side of the table and affix with a staple.
Lay towels on the ground.
Flip the table over.Set out your chips and play cards.

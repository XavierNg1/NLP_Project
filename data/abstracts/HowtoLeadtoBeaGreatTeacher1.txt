Realize that the awe of a new school year in a new class on day one won't last, for "you as teacher in name and position only".
Respect students, and their needs for success and involvement: Thank the class for working and doing well.
Succeed by breeding success.
Focus on definite (certain) accountability, but, also, with a focus on applications instead of mere repetitions; use a quiz to motivate a summary; and use a test to motivate recap and review (namely, successful reps for learning without boredom):


Renew hope: Reteaching, without starting over; keep making use of learned skills.
Expect resistance against excellence that is gained by discomfort (temporary embarrassment, fear, confusion or boredom).
Earn attention in your class by success in achievement.
Avoid ungraceful meanness and abusive shouting.
Instruct positive expectations that translate into assisting you to have authority in your class.
Depend on progressive discipline within your/their classroom.
Depend on student centered goals, but question: "Are we enabling unacceptable behavior in order for us to appease those persons (who are causing disruption) in order for us not be rejected, confronted, challenged, or hated by them?",
Show confidence which overcomes doubt and fear, anger and anxiety by creating a peace of mind that helps both you and your class.
Criticize or praise the whole class: "Wow, everybody is working!",
Create daily successful discipline.
Know what to do as a leader who is out in front of the class or group, followed by the others.

Work your way up.
Get plenty of rest.
Start off with improving your aim by using handguns or assault rifles.
Sniping doesn't mean shooting from far places.
Know what you're aiming at.
Similar to leading is accounting for drop.
If you spy another sniper in your zoom, then you should shoot them if they are concentrated on something else.
Now that you can snipe well, practice avoiding other snipers and enemies while you go sniping.
Keep practicing until you perfect your aiming and damage.

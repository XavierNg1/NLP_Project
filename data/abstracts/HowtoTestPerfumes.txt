Walk around the mall without wearing any scent and look around for perfumes you have sampled before and likes, or perfumes that seem really popular (like on TV.),
Approach the sales counter and ask the representative to introduce you to the perfume.
Ask her/him to spray the perfume on a piece of paper (sample sheets) or if they have little bottle samples or plastic samples to take home, ask them about those options.
Collect some samples (paper, glass, or plastic) and put them in your bag/pocket.
Ask for options.
Go home.
If you have the option to go home, then smell one paper sample in the car (if you're not driving), then when you get home, wait half an hour, try another paper sample, and put them away.
Glass and plastic.
Before buying, make conversation with the rep about why you choose this perfume and any opinions he/she has about the perfume.

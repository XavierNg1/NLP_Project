Talk to your baby about the transition.
Place a mattress or crib right next to your bed.
Start placing your baby in the crib or on her own mattress for nap time.
Gradually begin to move the bed or crib away from your bed while continuing each night to reassure him that you are right next to him.
When you have moved her bed to her own room, lie down with her while she falls asleep.
When your baby wakes up during the night, hold her hand and soothe her, but do not let her come back into your own bed.

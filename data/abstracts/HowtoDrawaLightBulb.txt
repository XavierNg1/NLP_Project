First of all, you will need a piece of paper.
Draw a circle-like shape similar to the one in the picture.
Next, draw two little \ and / on each side of the bulb as shown in the image and connect them with a curved line.
Draw two zigzags coming down from each side of the line vertically.
Draw curved lines from one of the zigzags to the other.
Draw a vertical line which goes down right the middle of the bottom part of the light bulb and a horizontal line on it.
Next draw a line from the end of the zigzag to the place where the two lines meet which you drew in the previous step.
Erase the guidelines which you drew in step 6 and make the bottom of the light bulb slightly curved, not sharp.

If you want your light bulb turned off you can add some lines and shadows for special effects.
In this step you are going to draw the inside of the light bulb.
Next draw a wiggly/zigzag line connecting one of the lines you drew in the previous step to the other one.
If you didn't add shadows to your light bulb you can colour it in.
Admire the awesome light bulb you drew.Finished.

Break the ice.
Make her laugh.
Dress like you mean business.
Keep yourself smelling fresh.
Don't be threatening.
Master a talent.
Boost your confidence.
Always look into her eyes when speaking with her.
Be careful about teasing.
Be sensitive and caring.
Find something to share and bond over.
Be honest with her.
Make her feel like the center of your universe.
Respect her.
Be willing to lead or follow.
Learn to dance.
Get to know her best friend.
Be a gentleman about kissing.
Be original.
Learn a poem.
Know when to make your move.

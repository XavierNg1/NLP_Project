Poke two holes in a raw, regular-sized egg.
Reach through the larger hole with a needle, wire, straightened paper clip, toothpick, or small balloon pump.
Decide how you want to blow out your eggs.
Set up a clean wide bowl or jar to catch the insides of the egg.
If you want to use the traditional method, hold up the thin straw to the small hole.
If you want to use a syringe or special egg blower, hold the tool to the small hole in the egg.
Take a glass of water and pour it over the eggshell to rinse it out.
Dry the intact eggshells.
Done.

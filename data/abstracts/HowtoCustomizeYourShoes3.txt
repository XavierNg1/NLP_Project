Use a foam brush or a paintbrush to apply the glitter glue to your shoes.
Cover your bowl with plastic wrap and let the shoes dry.
Keep applying more coats of glitter glue until your shoes are as glittery as you want them to be.
Apply a coat of plain, glossy Mod Podge once the last coat of glitter has dried.

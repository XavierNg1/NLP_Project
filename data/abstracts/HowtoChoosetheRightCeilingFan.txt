Decide where you want to install the fan.
Consider various room factors:


Room Size

30" ceiling fan for rooms up to 8' x 10' (small bedrooms, walk-in closets, smaller kitchens)
42" ceiling fan for rooms up to 12' x 12' (medium bedrooms, kitchens, small recreation areas)
52" ceiling fan for rooms up to 18' x 20' (large bedrooms, family rooms, great rooms, dining rooms)


Ceiling Height

Low ceiling: Hugger mount or traditional- mount without down rod
Standard 8' ceiling: traditional- mount with down rod
9' or Higher ceiling: Extended down rod
Sloped ceiling: Extended down rod


You will need to check the floor to ceiling height of the blades.
Think about electricity.
Choose a good quality fan.

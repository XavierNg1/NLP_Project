Calculate impedance.
Therefore Impedance Total (represented as “Z”) is equal to Real Power squared plus Reactive power squared and then take the square root of the answer.
Find your phase angle.
Take the inverse of the tangent and acquire your Phase Angle.
Calculate your total Current (Amps).
You must now calculate your apparent power which is represented as “S”.
You must now calculate your true power which is represented as “P”.
Calculate your Power Factor!

It is proven that people with 3-5 extra-curricular activities do better in school, so don't overload your schedule, but don't be anti-social.
If you see someone being mean to a newbie, stand up for them.
If someone looks upset and is on their own, go and check on them.
When in a conversation, don't dominate it by going on and on about yourself.
Run for class president and/or school council - go somewhere along those lines.

Relax!

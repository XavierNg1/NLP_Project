Recall if you've had contact with someone who has herpes.Herpes simplex virus is very common and highly contagious.
Look for early symptoms.
Observe more typical whitlow symptoms in the disease phase.Once the initial prodrome phase has passed, you will see far more specific symptoms that point clearly to whitlow:


Swelling, redness, and rash, with fluid filled vesicles around the area.The vesicles may rupture, and a white, clear, or bloody fluid will come out.
Get a formal medical diagnosis.
Take antiviral medication.
Take precautions to prevent spreading the infection.Since the virus can spread through contact, your healthcare provider may advise you not to touch others, or even to avoid touching yourself with the infected finger.
Wrap the infected area.Your healthcare provider may wrap the infected area with a bandage, cloth, or any form of dry wrap with medical tape.
Monitor children closely.
Get pain medication if necessary.The doctor may provide or advise you to use over-the-counter pain medication like Advil, Tylenol, ibuprofen or aspirin.
Ask the doctor to test for bacterial infection.If you try to burst or drain the vesicles on your finger on your own, you give debris and bacteria opportunity to invade.
Take antibiotics as prescribed.
Do not pick at vesicles.
Soak the infected area.Warm water can provide pain relief from whitlow.
Add soap to the water for open blisters.
Apply magnesium sulphate paste.
Use an ice pack.The extreme cold will numb the nerves in the surrounding area, relieving the pain.
Reduce your stress levels.

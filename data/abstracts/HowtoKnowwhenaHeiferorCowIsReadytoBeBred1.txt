Depending on the breed of the heifer, most heifers will start to show the first signs of heat when they are between 9 and 22 months of age.
Usually it's best to wait until they are at least 15 months of age before breeding.
The heifer must also be at least 60% to 65% of the average mature weight of the cowherd before she can be bred.
In order to successfully breed a heifer, there are two ways to go about it:



Choose a bull with good (as in low) calving-ease numbers to breed her (and other heifers like her), or ...
Time her estrus periods so that you can Artificially Inseminate (AI) her (or get an AI tech to do it for you).

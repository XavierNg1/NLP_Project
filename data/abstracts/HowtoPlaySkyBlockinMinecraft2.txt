Use the wood from your tree to craft a workbench.

Create a cobblestone generator.
"Mine" the cobblestone from your generator, using the stone to create a furnace/kiln and better pickaxes to replace the original wooden one when it breaks.
Craft a furnace/kiln from eight cobblestone and burn one block of wood using the second reserved block of wood as fuel to get your first charcoal.
Use sticks and some of the string from the supply chest to craft a fishing rod.
Continue to generate and harvest cobblestone.

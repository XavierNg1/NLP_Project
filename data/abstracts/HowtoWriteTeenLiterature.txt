Choose an interesting title for your work of literature.
You're going to need a reliable narrative voice throughout your book.
Now that you've decided what your narrative will be like, come up with some 'trademarks' and catchphrases that can be inserted in to your book (and its inevitable sequels!).
Set some rules for your style.
Now all you've got left to do is actually start writing your book.
Now, all you need is a story!!

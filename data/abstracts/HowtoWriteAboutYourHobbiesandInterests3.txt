Decide whether or not a “Hobbies and Interests” section is appropriate for this job.
Be brief.
Choose the interests you include carefully.Don’t list an interest if you’re not actually passionate about it — if it comes up in an interview, your lack of passion and knowledge will give you away as a resume passer.
Connect your interests to the job.Wherever possible, demonstrate how the skills and qualities you develop through your hobbies make you a better candidate for the position for which you’re applying.

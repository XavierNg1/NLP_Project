Research the fish you would like to own.
Buy a tank that is going to fit all the fish!,
Get substrate that your fish would expect i.e.
Chose a filter system that will be right for you.
Buy plants and wood to make hiding places for your fish.
You'll need a thermometer and heater!,
Get a hood!,
Buy all the chemicals you need to start up and maintain a tank, such as dechlorinator to make tap water safe for fish.

,
Make sure your tank is on a sturdy stand, 1 gallon (3.8Â L) of water weight about ten pounds plus all the rocks!,
Add all of your chemicals to the tank, plug in the filters and let the tank run!,
Test the water!,
Get your fish!,
Once you bring the fish home (only after the water has safe levels of chemicals) "float" them in the bag they are in on top of the water for about half an hour.
Turn off any tank lights to make the transition less stressful for the fish.
Doing weekly or biweekly 25% water changes will keep your fish happy and healthy.
Enjoy!

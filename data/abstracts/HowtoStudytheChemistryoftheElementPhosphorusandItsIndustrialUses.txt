the atom phosphorus is located below nitrogen in the periodic table.
its outer shell electronic configuration is 3s2-3p3.
an example of a compound of phosphorus with five bonds is PCl5.
this is manifested in the compound hexa fluorophosphates or PF6-.
Phosphorus is biologically important as it forms the phosphate group, which is incorporated in the ATP molecule or adenosine triphosphate.
Enzymes is catalysts that use ATP to catalyze metabolic reactions inside our body such as Na+, K+, and ATPase.
Elemental phosphorus is toxic to human tissue.
the most reactive allotrope is the white form.
Phosphorus occurs in the form of a molecule, which unlike nitrogen which occurs as a diatomic molecule.
Phosphorus compounds have many applications due to the variety of compounds it can form.
Organophosphates and organophosphonates are organophosphorus compounds, which have activity against acetylcholine esterase (the enzyme that is responsible for degrading acetylcholine at the synaptic cleft).this enzyme.
this potential use of these groups of compounds has found use for them in chemistry and industry.
Organophosphorus compounds have wide use in organic chemistry.
Phosphines is used in the organic labs in the famous Witting reaction, which is used to convert a ketone to a double bond.as was mentioned previously PCl5 and PCl3 are used a chlorinating reagents, which convert the alcohol (A bad leaving group) to the better leaving group (the chloride).
Phosphides is inorganic phosphorus compounds, which are compounds of metals with phosphorus.
an example of a phosphide is Ca3P2 or calcium phosphide.

Find the following elements, which you also memorize the methods or formulas for per the following KEY:


Determine whether element a of the equation is positive and the parabola has a minimum and opens up, or a is negative, and the parabola has a maximum and opens down.
Given the example equation y = x^2 - 2x - 15 , analyze the parabola it represents into the above elements:


Find that the element a is missing and must therefore equal 1, which is positive, so the graph has a minimum and opens upwards.
Graph the chart in Excel:


Input x into cell A1 and y into cell B1.

Select cells A2:B26 and using the Chart Wizard of Chart from the Ribbon, select Charts, All/Other, Scatter, Smooth Line Scatter.

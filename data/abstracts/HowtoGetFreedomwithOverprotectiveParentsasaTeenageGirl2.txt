Follow the rules.It’s natural to test your boundaries when you’re a teenager, but breaking your parents’ rules isn’t going to convince them that you’re ready for more responsibility.
Show respect and have a good attitude, even if your parents’ rules don’t change.Don’t be a brooding, angry teen.
Be persistent.
Don’t be secretive.Remember, your parents’ worst fear is that you’ll put yourself in a dangerous situation where they won’t be able to protect you.
Don’t lie.If you say you’re going to the mall after school, don’t end up at a friend’s house with no explanation.

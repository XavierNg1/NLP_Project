Find at least six people to play.
Pick a captain for each team.
Divide the players into two equal teams.
Have each team stand in a straight line, holding hands.
Call a player over.
The player who was called runs across the space between teams and tries to break through the arms of two players.
If the player doesn't get through the line, they join the opposing team.
Continue playing until one team is down to one person.

Open the Disk Management utility.
Select drive and volume that you want to shrink.
Right-click on the volume and select "Shrink Volume".
Select how much space you want to shrink the volume by.
Find the new unallocated space.
I get an error message when trying to open Disk Management.
I want to undo the Shrink Volume process and add it back to the original drive.
I can only select a small portion of my free space.
My hard drive is advertised as being X big, but I have less space than that.

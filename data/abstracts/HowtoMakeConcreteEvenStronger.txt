Understand the two factors determining the strength of concrete when used in building:


Compressive strength is obtained by design, using the cement to aggregate ratio as a base, then adding admixtures for increased strength.
Determine the requirements for your project.
Adjust the mixture you are using if you are mixing your own concrete.
Use other admixtures like fly ash as a substitute for part of the fine aggregate in your mixture to increase the compressive strength if you like.
Research chemical admixtures to find specific chemicals you can purchase to change the properties of your concrete.
Add reinforcing to increase the strength of concrete in your project.

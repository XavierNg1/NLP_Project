The Cabin Filter is not unlike the standard air filters you replace regularly.
Locate the passenger side cowl.
With the hood up, stand at the front, passenger side of your car.
Use a very thin screwdriver or knife to carefully pry up the retaining clips and work them off the cowl.
Open the hood and remove the cowl.
Find the plastic visor that fits over the filter, but was under the cowl you just removed.
Use a shop vac to remove any large debris like leaves, bugs, etc.
Replace the filter and set the visor by pushing it back into place.

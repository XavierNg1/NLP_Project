Come to the mountain prepared.
Rent a pair of boots and a board at your local board shop if you've never snowboarded.
Strap your one foot into the front of the board.
Push yourself to the ski-lift or bunny slope with your non-dominant foot.
Get ready for the lift by bending your knees and shifting your weight back.
Buckle in your opposite foot on the lift so that you can get off easily.

Collect old magazines you're willing to take pages out of.
Rip out 11 pages you like for each side of the bag.
Fold all the magazine pieces long ways to form evenly sized strips.

,
Tape five strips together horizontally, as shown here.

,
Weave six strips vertically through the horizontal piece you made in the previous step.
Check for evenness and make any adjustments needed.
Place a piece of cardboard the same size as the woven magazine side onto the "back" of the woven piece.
Carefully, so as not to create bubbles, bumps or unevenness, tape clear tape over the entire front of the woven piece.
Cut a magazine piece to the size of the cardboard piece.
Decide on the bag's final shape.
When you have made all the sides, assemble your bag.
Finished.

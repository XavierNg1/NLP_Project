Don't panic, in the event that your child does get lost or separated.
Stay collected and focused on what you need to do next.
Find the nearest employee or security officer, and explain that your child is lost.
Give the employee or officer a complete description of your child: what he or she looks like, what he or she is wearing, etc.
Cooperate with the park security.
Stay where you are, unless the park security instructs you otherwise.
Check the park's Lost & Found center, and see if you can find your child or young group member there.

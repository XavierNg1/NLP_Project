Prepare your cat for sedation.
Give your cat her medication.Make sure to follow your vet's dosage instructions carefully.
Make sure the cat swallows the medication.While keeping her body firmly secured, release her mouth from your hands.
Use alternate delivery methods if needed.Taking oral medication doesn't feel natural to cats, and yours may fight back when you try to sedate her.
Wait for the sedative to kick in.Different medications and dosages take different lengths of time to take effect.

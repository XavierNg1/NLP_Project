Put the yeast and the sugar in a glass.
Mix the flour and the salt, then add the yeast mixture and add the 5 cups of water.
Cover the dough and leave in a warm place to rise for about an hour.
Knead again for a couple of minutes with floury hands and divide into 5 parts.
Flatten each ball of dough (open the dough) to about the size of a medium plate (20cm to 24cm).
Remove from the oven and leave to cool down (about 30 minutes).

Reduce Entei to a low enough HP (red is certainly enough) and paralyze it in your first few encounters.
Catch a level 61 Golbat in the basement floor of Cerulean Cave.
Give your Golbat the item Leftovers.
Stock up on Ultra Balls, Full Restores, and Hyper Potions.
Start with Mean Look.
On the turns when you don't use Taunt, throw an Ultra Ball or heal your Golbat.

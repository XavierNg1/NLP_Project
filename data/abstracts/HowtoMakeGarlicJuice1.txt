Pick the cloves from your head or bulb of garlic.
Lay one clove on top of a cutting board or counter.
Place the broad, flat side of a large chef's knife directly over the clove.
Hold the handle of the knife with one hand and quickly strike the flat side of the blade with your other.
Repeat the smashing procedure with the remaining cloves of garlic.

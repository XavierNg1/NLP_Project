Think before you post your problem or topic on the forum.
Bear in mind that the forum is public, and so everyone will read what you post.
If a member is rude to you or says something to you that you do not like, do not be rude back to them.
If a forum member continues to be rude to you or writes an offensive post about you, do not post offensive comments back to them.
If the thread you are posting on turns into a flame war, or heated arguments with other members, it is best to leave the discussion and not post on there again.
If a forum member or other forum members say something to you or give advice you do not like, or are unsympathetic towards your problem you have posted about.
Sometimes if a topic gets out of hand or cannot be resolved or it turns into a heated argument.
Think before signing up for the forum.
If you are not happy with the forum, it is better to leave that forum and find another forum that you are happy with.

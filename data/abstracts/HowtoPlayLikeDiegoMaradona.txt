Get soccer boots.
Be creative.
Be confident.
Dribble.
Humiliate defenders.
Dribble the ball with the laces of your boot, don't kick it with the front side of the boot.
Do footsteps once you're dribbling, this will act as betterment for your ball control.
Do less touches.
Watch Maradona.
Practice.
Have fun.

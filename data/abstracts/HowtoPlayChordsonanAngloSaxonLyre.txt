Pick up your lyre (let's assume a 6-string in C for the sake of argument) and tune it to a standard diatonic major tuning: C-D-E-F-G-A.
To form a C Major chord: use your left-hand fingertips to muffle the second, fourth, and sixth strings.
To form a D Minor chord: block the first, third, and fifth strings.

Recognize that children are always learning to control their environment.
Learn to recognize an oncoming tantrum.
Choose a tantrum rug.
When a child begins tantrum behaviours, tell the child (WITHOUT raising or changing your voice or expression) that the way they are behaving is unacceptable Do NOT tell the child THEY are naughty or bad.
Tell the child (again WITHOUT raising your voice or changing your expression) "You are not allowed to throw tantrums here.",
When telling the child that they cannot throw the tantrum 'here', pull out the "tantrum rug".
Tell the child WHILE picking them up (this obviously only works with small children), that they may only throw tantrums on the tantrum rug.

,
Take them to the rug and gently put them on the rug.
Because the adult has made a choice about the tantrum and is now controlling the environment, the tantrum usually loses appeal.

,
Do this whole process with as much calm as possible.
When the child has stopped the tantrum (often this happens the instance they touch the rug) ask if they are done or if they want to stay on the rug a bit longer?

,
AS SOON AS the tantrum is over, pick the child up and give them a hug, tell them you are proud of them for learning to act nicely and ask if they want to put the rug awayâ€¦then put the rug away.

,
If they again begin showing signs of throwing a tantrum, put the rug back out and repeat the process.

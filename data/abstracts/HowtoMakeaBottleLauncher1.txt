Collect the materials and building supplies.
Drill a hole into one of the 1/2" PVC caps using your 9/16" drill bit.
Pull the valve through the drilled hole so it is air-tight.
Place the top of the empty, capless soda bottle in the top of the 1/2 x 1" bushing.
Cut the steel rod into a 10" piece, then bend your steel rod into a U shape roughly 1/3 inch wide.
Press the two ends of the rod into the side of the bushing, mark where they touch the meet the bottle cap, then drill two holes to thread the steel rod into the bushing.
Take the 1/2" x 1/4" bushing and carve out the stopper with a sharp knife or a Dremel tool.
Cut a piece of 1/2" pipe to 12" long, then make a mark 2" from one of the ends.
Glue the 1/2" x 1/4" bushing (the one you carved out) so that it ends right at your 2" mark.
Glue and elbow onto the small "stub" pointing out from your bushing.
Glue the big PVC coupling to the other end of the bushing, the one already glued to the PVC rod.
Glue the bushing with the launch pad holes drilled into the other end of this coupling.

Hold the trout with one hand pointing its head to the sky, or simply lay the fish on its side on a cutting board.
Take a knife starting at the anus and gently cut the fish along the belly.
Insert the knife into the tissue between the trout's gills (near where its "collarbone" would be).

,
Cut outward, perpendicular to the belly.
Grab the entrails and pull them out.

,
Rinse the exposed meat in cold water.

,
Use a spoon or a finger to scratch away the blood line along the spine.

,
Wash the fish with slightly salted water to remove any leftover residue.

,
Place the gutted trout on its back.
Upon reaching the anal fin, make sure you keep your knife as close to it as possible.
Repeat the removal of the ribs on the other side of the trout.
Take your knife and cut down and in toward the backbone.
Remove that “whole center piece” or the frame of the trout.
You will notice there are still some small pin bones which connected the muscle to the frame of the fish.

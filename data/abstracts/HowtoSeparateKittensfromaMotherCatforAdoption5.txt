Introduce the new kitten to a cat already living in the house gradually.
Set up the kitten’s den in an area your current cat does not use frequently.
Provide a scent introduction first.
Feed the cats on either side of the new kitten’s door.
Have the cats trade places once the kitten has adjusted to his new den.
Let the cats meet one another once the kitten is comfortable in his new home.
Try feeding the cats together if they are not getting along.
Separate the kitten from the other cat if the kitten has a little too much energy.

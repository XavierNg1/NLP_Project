Begin by feeding the baby bird puppy or cat food soaked in water.
Add as many bugs as possible to the puppy or cat food.
Dust all live foods with a vitamin and mineral supplement.
Feed the bird often.
Offer water, but only from a budgie sipper bottle.
Change the food you feed the bird as it gets bigger.

Receive the gift of faith in God for salvation -- by grace, through faith, not of yourself, not of works, but it is the gift of Father, God.
Spur one another onward in love and good deeds; helping one another by fellowship.
Make it a priority to maintain your faith and hope in Christ without first seeing your goal/what you want: Step out in faith and hope to seek your goal.
Try to be at church every week.
Make time to read your Bible, and to relate the word of God to yourself.
Get close to God by feeding the hungry.
Be persistent -- not by sight: But walking by faith.

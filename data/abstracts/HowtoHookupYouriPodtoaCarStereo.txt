Buy a cassette adapter at your local Radio Shack or Best Buy store.Check the manual first.
Buy a wireless transmitter- these devices usually attach to your iPod, and require you to tune your radio to a designated FM frequency.
Also, there is always some interference or static when transmitting and there are times you can't find an open frequency, especially if there's a powerful radio transmitter nearby.
Try using RCA cables for better sound quality.

,
Remove the stereo from your dash.
Be sure that your stereo has some type of input in the back.
Decide where you will be putting your iPod and where you want the wire going.
Precautions- If its RCA then the RCA to 1/8th inch jack should be fine, get an extension for the 1/8th inch if you need it but don't go splicing wires!,
Check that everything works, which usually requires switching to an "input" mode or "auxiliary" mode on your stereo.

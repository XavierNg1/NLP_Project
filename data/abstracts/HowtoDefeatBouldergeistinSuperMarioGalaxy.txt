Go to one of the levels where you fight Bouldergeist.
Avoid the rocks.
Shake the remote.
A part of Bouldergeist should break off.
After you defeat him the first time, he will form again and grow hands.
Try to collect two Black Boos at a time so as to do extra damage.
Be careful.
Try not to get creamed in any way, as if you mess up even once, you WILL have to start over.

After defeating him a second time, you have finally beaten Bouldergeist!

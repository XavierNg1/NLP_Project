Make your own applesauce, if possible.
Review your recipe to see if it calls for oil or melted butter.
Substitute using a 1 to 1 ratio.
Start substituting applesauce for a portion of the fat to get familiar with the effect of the oil.
Measure applesauce the same way as oil, in a liquid measuring cup.
Incorporate the applesauce into the wet ingredients with a mixer before combining the dry ingredients.

Measure three parts sand to one part masonry cement.
Use the right amount of water.
Use the correct sand and mortar.
Consider using lime as an additive.
Keep in mind that adding lime to your mixture will make the mortar set more quickly.
Match the recipe to the weather.
Mortar mixed to the right consistency should hold onto a trowel held at a 90 degree angle, but should also be wet enough to work easily and pour into and out of buckets.

,
If working on cold, near freezing weather, try adding slightly more lime and hot/warm water to aid the hydration reaction of cement and help it set quickly.
Wet the mixer, wheelbarrow, and/or buckets.
Add the dry ingredients and start mixing.
Get your face out of the way, wear breathing protection, and don't breathe in any of the dust created, mortar mixes contain Silicates which can cause COPD, or other Cancers.

,
Add extra water if necessary.
Make a pile of sand and place the appropriate number of cement bags on or right next to the pile.
Cut open one side of the bag staving it with the blade of the shovel.
Use a small shovel or hoe to work the mix around vigorously, making sure that the mix is distributed uniformly and even colored.
Form a crater with the shovel and pour the water inside.
Use the shovel or hoe to pick the dry mix from the edges and throw it to the water in the center.
Let it mix for 3-5 minutes and let it sit another minute.
Start laying your block.
Always wear the proper safety gear when handling mortar.
Add a small amount of water periodically.
Never make more than you'll use in 2 hours.
Clean the mixer and all tools at the end of the day.
It is always better to mix less and have to mix another small batch than having excess material harden on your tools or a big hard lump to pick up and dispose of.

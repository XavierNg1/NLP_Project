Start numbering with the bottom, since the lowest, thinnest string is always your first string.
Know the second string, the second from the bottom, is a B.
Know the third string, the third from the bottom, is a G. Notice how, on many guitars, there are two “types” of strings – the thinner silver ones on the bottom, and thicker, wound strings on top.
Know the fourth string, the third from the top, is a D. The fourth string, or the third from the top, is a D in standard tuning.
Know that the fifth string, the second thickest, is an A.
Know that the sixth string, the thickest string, is your E string.

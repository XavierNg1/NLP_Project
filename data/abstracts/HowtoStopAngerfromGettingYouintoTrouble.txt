Be conscious of when you're about to blow.
Take whatever immediate action you can to cool off.
Step away and reevaluate.
Try to understand why people do what they do.
Try to understand why you feel this way.
Ask for help.
Vent your feelings in a healthy way.
Try not to make important decisions when you're angry.
Own up to what you've done and forgive yourself.

Design a circuit that can take the ~6 volts from the motor, store it, and then convert it to the 5 volts that are needed for the USB device.
Select a motor.
Attach the motor close to the rear brake mounts directly on the bike frame using a piece of a meter stick between the motor and frame to act as a spacer, then tighten 2 hose-clamps around it.
Build the circuit.

Build an enclosure.

To understand how to break the subculture rules, you need to know which subculture you belong to in the first place.
Stoners.
Now that you know what you are, eliminate all prejudice you have against people from other subcultures.
Now that you are over your prejudice, strike up a conversation with someone from a different clique, whether they are someone you specifically wanted to be friends with, or you are just looking to broaden your horizons.
Think over that first conversation, to see if you have anything in common, however small.
If you think you and this person/people have friend potential, continue to hang out, maybe invite them over.
OK, so it worked out between you two as friends; but, like The Fox and the Hound, people may be trying to keep you apart, or critical of your friendship.

Have a Pok√©mon with the "Compound Eyes" ability, one with Frisk, and one with either False Swipe (to make catching it easier) or Thief (so you can just steal it afterward).
Go to Route 209.
Use the Poke Radar until you find a Chansey.
Repeat as many times as needed until you have the amount of Lucky Eggs you desire.

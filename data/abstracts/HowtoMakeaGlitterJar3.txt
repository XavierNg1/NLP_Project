Find a suitable jar.
Select the paint color and the glitter color so that they complement each other.
Lay down a piece of box cardboard to cover the work surface.
Turn the clean jar upside down on the cardboard.
Spray the jar or jars.
Leave to dry.
Decide where you want the glitter line to be.
Paint Mod Podge at the point of the line, around one row or circle of the jar.
Repeat in rows or circles around the rest of the jar, in sections.
Let the glitter sit for an hour.
Finish with a coating of Mod Podge to protect the glitter and keep it in place, especially when handling or if the jar is knocked.
Done.

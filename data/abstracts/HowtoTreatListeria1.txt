Allow your immune system to combat the infection naturally.If you do not fall into any of the high-risk categories and appear to have only a mild listeriosis infection (which is the case for the vast majority of people), your doctor will likely advise that you rest and allow your immune system to naturally fight off the infection.
Get plenty of rest.
Drink plenty of fluids.
Boost your immune system.

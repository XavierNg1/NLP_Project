Set up your guitar as you normally would.
Hold the pick like you normally would, and push down on the 5th and 6th strings with the pick.
Slide the pick up the string at an even speed.
Once you've reached the 12th fret, slap a finger from your left hand on the fourteenth fret.
If you don't get that awesome, dull, low-pitched 'screech', change the position of the pick, pressure from your left hand, etc.

Find a rug importer in your area, preferably one who deals directly with the weaver(s) who made them, they tend to be better aware of their products' origins and quality.
Come to the store with a basic idea of what you want, and the level of intricacy you're going for (generally, the more intricate the knot, the more expensive the rugs will be).
Begin browsing rugs that are in your price range, and pick out maybe 10-12 that you like.
Take your list of rugs and sort them into groups.
From those groups you've made, depending on the size and quantity of the groups, eliminate two or three from each.
If possible, get your remaining rugs next to each other for comparison.
If elimination by comparison leaves you with one rug, WAIT!!,
If you are left with 3 rugs, try to eliminate it to two.
Once the rugs arrive at your house, bring them to the room you're decorating.
Don't be pressured to make a decision.

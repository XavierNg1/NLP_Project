Read a catalog or look at the American Girl website ahead of time to help decide what to buy.
,
Consider your budget.
Consider the ways that the owner of the doll enjoys playing with the doll.
Consider the seasonality of the items.
If the person you're buying for (whether it's yourself or someone else) is a young AG fan (roughly 7-9 - kids younger than that probably won't have AG dolls, because they're less likely to be able to take good care of them), consider how easy the accessory is to use.
Go to the AG Place and then go to the section that suits your doll.
Choose items that match the hobbies of the doll owner.
Think of what colors you like.

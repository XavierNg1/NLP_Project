Choose the right location.As in any business, location is key.
Visit prospective cafes.Before you buy a café, you’ll want to see it for yourself.
Ask lots of questions.Learn as much as possible about buying a cafe before you even begin scouting for locations.
Investigate the competition.Your cafe probably won’t be the only one in town.
Check financial data.When a cafe or other business is advertised for sale, the ad will usually state the business’ most recent monthly or quarterly revenue.
Speak to the customers.
Evaluate the staff.If you’re given access to the cafe, talk to the staff in both public and private.
Talk to suppliers.Does the cafe pay its bills on time?,
Think about ongoing expenses.While rent is an obvious ongoing expense, you might also have to pay for electricity, air conditioning, heating, and trash pickup.

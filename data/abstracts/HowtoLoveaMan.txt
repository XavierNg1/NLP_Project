Give him his "guy time.",
Avoid saying "I told you so.",
Give him time to unwind.
Don't try to talk everything through.
Really listen to him.
Don't demean him.
Don't try to change him.
Let him know what you're thinking.
Admit when you're wrong.
Give him some genuine compliments.
Show your gratitude.
Build him up when he needs it.
Be his lover, not his mother.
Make time for sexy time.
Wow him with your confidence.
Show your love through touch.
Always keep up the chase.

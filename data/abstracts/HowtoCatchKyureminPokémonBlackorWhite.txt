Gain access to Lacunosa Town by completing the Pok√©mon League.
Once in Lacunosa Town, make sure you are stocked up on Poke Balls and healing items as the battle will be quite a challenge (it is level 75 after all).
When you get there you will be greeted by the confusing yet quite small Route 13.
If you started this event from Undella Town, your journey is much simpler.
Once this is done, you will arrive at Giant Chasm.
You will be introduced to an extremely large and complex maze for you to go through.
After this sound, the ground will cover with snow (the roar was Kyurem and the snow was his doing in case you hadn't realized.
Once inside the cavern, getting to Kyurem is a doddle.
Once Kyurem is caught, exit the cavern and all the snow will have disappeared.

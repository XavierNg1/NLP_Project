Learn the movements.
To start (basic roll):


Bend down.
When you feel like you learned it, find a jump.
Start small, don't go crazy and want to jump off of something that's ten feet tall.
Jump up and forwards, bringing your knees to your chest and your hands up.
Beginning your roll.
You are now starting the roll: don't back out now, you might hurt yourself.

Catch his attention, but in a different manner that all girls usually do.
Make him respect you.
Try getting to know him a little.
Ok, now you can try to flirt with him a little.
These dates will decide whether he's the right guy for you, or not.
Go on like this until you're sure he loves you.
If you finally get him, remember how to keep him too: don't be too possessive, or too demanding, or don't try to change him too much (making him yours is already a big enough change).

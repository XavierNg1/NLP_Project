Allow the owner to suspend or delay work without paying compensation through a “suspension of work” clause.
Check to make sure a “no damage for delay” clause is enforceable in your state.
Include a statement that the contractor cannot file a claim for additional costs if actions by the owner cause the project to be delayed.

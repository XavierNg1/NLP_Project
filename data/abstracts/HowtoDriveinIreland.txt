DO NOT drink and drive.
Watch out for anything unusual on the road.
If you are from North America or any other place where they drive on their right side of the road with the driver's side on the left, you must remember to drive on your left side of the road, in an Irish car where the driver's side is on the right.
Don't drive for long periods of time, fatigue is a killer.

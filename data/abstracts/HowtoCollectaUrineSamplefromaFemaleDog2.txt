Plan ahead to collect your dog’s urine.
Wait until the dog has a full bladder and put her on a collar and lead.
Approach quietly from behind as your dog squats.
Collect as much urine as you can.
Pour the urine from the container into the screw-top jar.
Take the sample into the vet’s office right away.

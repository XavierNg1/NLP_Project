Observe any changes to your breast.Although most men do not spend a lot of time feeling or examining their breast tissue, it is still possible for men to get breast cancer (although it is much more rare than it is for women).
Watch for any skin changes in your breast area.Potential changes to be aware of include redness, scaling, dimpling, or puckering of the skin on or around your breast.
Notice any changes to your nipple.Discharge from your nipple, a nipple that turns inward, or other changes such as redness or scaling around your nipple are all causes for concern.
Be aware of the risk factors.Although male breast cancer is rare (it account for less than 1% of the total breast cancer cases among men and women), it is still possible.
Receive a physical exam.The first step to diagnosing breast cancer in men (after you have had signs or symptoms causing you to be concerned) is to receive a physical exam from your doctor.
Obtain a mammogram.A mammogram is a specialized form of x-ray designed to look at the breast tissue.
Consider an ultrasound.An ultrasound is another way to examine suspicious masses in the breast tissue, and to evaluate the level of concern as to whether or not they could be cancerous.
Opt for a biopsy.A biopsy is where a needle is inserted into the suspicious sample of breast tissue, and some cells are withdrawn for examination under the microscope.
Perform diagnostic testing on the cancer itself.If breast cancer is found, you will then receive further testing to evaluate specific details about the cancer that can provide insight into the best course of treatment.

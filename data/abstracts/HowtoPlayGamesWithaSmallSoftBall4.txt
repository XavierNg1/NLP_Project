Note/s: You need to make sure you have a friend to help and at least one index finger, ready to go!,
Tell your friend to get both thumbs and IFS and form a large circle with them.
Tell them to hold their "circle" in the air a bit high and stand at the end of a smooth, small table.
Now, you stand at the other end with the ball on the table, in front of you.

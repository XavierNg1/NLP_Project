Football season starts in late summer.
Any football player's training schedule involves working out with weights and cardiovascular conditioning.
Before you start hitting the weights you will need a proper schedule.
Start off talking about your cardio workout.
On day 1 of your workout you should work your chest and shoulders.
On day 2, You should train your upper back and arms.
Day 3 is the most important because you will be training your lower body.
To get optimal results from working out, you also need to eat healthy.
If you follow these guidelines, you should be in pretty good shape by the time the tryouts start.
Once you get on the line you should get in a 3 or 4-point stance (3 point stance is one hand on the ground 4 point stance is both hands).
When the ball is snapped that's when you jump the line.
Now if you get to the ball carrier successfully, just finish him.

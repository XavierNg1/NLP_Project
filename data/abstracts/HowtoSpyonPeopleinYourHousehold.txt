Think up excuses for WHY you're spying.
Get some gear like mirrors, periscopes, and short-range magnifiers like toy binoculars.

Wear clothing that somewhat resembles the color of the wall.
Breathe silently through your nose.

Wear socks.
If going up or down a staircase, stick close to the wall.
Stay below the waist level of your target.

Hide in plain sight.
If somehow, all of your plans go south, wing it.

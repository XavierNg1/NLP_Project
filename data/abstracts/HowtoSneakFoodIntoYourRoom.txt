Practice before doing an actual kitchen raid.

Decide when to go.
Check that the coast is clear.
Walk into the kitchen casually.
Open the area where the food is kept with care.
Add the food to your pockets or other stash area.

Hide things quickly if you have nosy parents who like checking up on you.
Cover up the evidence after eating in your room.
Shift items to easy-to-grab locations when you can.
Try to stash up on food over time, having the extra packet of chips in your room is a good idea.
Tuck food packages that are particularly flat into the waistband of your pants or skirt (preferably in the back).
Grab a paper towel for something more complicated such as dry cereal or crackers or chips, put the snack in it, and gather the ends into a little bag shape.
Put your snack into a cup.

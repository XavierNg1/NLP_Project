Read and study the 23rd Psalm-- and Be mindful of God's still small voice:


The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
Take it phrase by phrase.
Think of the implications to you and your sphere of influence for life, both mountain top and the darkest valley.
Decide what is most valuable to you:


Is it just: "What you have" in your life?,
Be available to God's will to walk in Biblical concepts.

,
Seek God while He may be found.
Seek scriptural wisdom and knowledge which does not ridicule faith -- plus always listen to your better judgment (not your careless, angry or silly side) for serious matters; believe Jesus that He will never leave you, but that He sends comfort and guidance by the Holy Spirit.

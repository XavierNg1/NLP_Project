Use an apostrophe to indicate ownership by a proper noun.
Be consistent when you use apostrophes after words that end in "s." When someone's name ends with an "s," it is acceptable to use an apostrophe without an "s" to show ownership, but linguists with the Chicago Manual of Style, along with others, prefer to add an "s" after the apostrophe.Note the difference in usage:

Acceptable: Jones' house; Francis' window; Enders' family.
Don't use an apostrophe to indicate ownership when using "it".
Use apostrophes to indicate ownership by a plural noun.
In general, don't use an apostrophe to indicate a plural.
Know how to use apostrophes for acronyms and years.
Use apostrophes in contractions.
Be aware of the its/it's trap.
Avoid using contractions that don't exist.
When writing in cursive, always connect letters after an apostrophe to the rest of the word.

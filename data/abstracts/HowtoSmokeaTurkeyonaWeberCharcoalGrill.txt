Choose a turkey under 20lbs to ensure it fits under the grill hood.
Combine the turkey rub ingredients together.
Take the turkey out of the fridge an hour ahead of time and thoroughly wash it inside and out, then pat dry with paper towels.
Put your wood chips in a pan and add apple cider vinegar, a shot of cognac or whiskey and water.
Put your aluminum drip pan in the middle of your grill and add about 8 charcoal briquettes to either side of the drip pan.
Loosely place aluminum foil over the wing tips to prevent burning.
Place your turkey exactly in the middle, add 1/2 a cup or so of your wood chips to either side, and close the lid.
Check back and add new wood chips about 20 minutes after first placing the turkey on the grill and check to ensure any liquid is landing in the drip pan not on the coals.
When it's done, check with your thermometer to ensure it is cooked.

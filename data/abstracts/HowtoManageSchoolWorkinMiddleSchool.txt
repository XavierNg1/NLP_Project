Mentally force yourself to do as much homework as you can complete.
Make a plan.
Turn in assignments on time.
Take every second your teacher gives you in class to complete an assignment/homework/project.
Push yourself, but not too hard.
No matter how hard it may be, try to pay as much attention in class as possible.
Make sure that you have a pencil and paper ready for every class.
Always have something that you love to do, or that is really fun for you to do at home.
When you get to your locker, make absolutely sure that you have everything you need to get your homework done.
When you get home, get right to your homework.
Do your homework from the longest and hardest to the shortest and easiest.
Finally, after you are done with your homework, put away EVERYTHING.
Try hard, be patient, and you will get better grades, more time, or whatever you are reading this for in the end.

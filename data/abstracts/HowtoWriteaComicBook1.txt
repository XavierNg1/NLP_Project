Think of a short, visual story to translate from your head to the page.
Draft out the plot of your story in paragraph form.
Create round, flawed, and exciting characters.
Introduce a problem, fail to solve it, and then resolve the problem with a surprise to create instant plot.
Whenever possible, convey information visually instead of through dialogue or exposition.
Using your drafts and paragraphs, create timelines for the action and characters in your story.
Fill in the dialogue, workshopping it with friends to make it realistic.

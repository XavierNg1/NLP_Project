Take a look at your modem, that's the box that was provided by your internet provider, there are usually 4 lights on that box.
If any of those lights are not in the "usual" pattern of on and flashing, remove the power plug from the back of the modem and wait about 45 to 60 seconds then plug it back in.

,
Now wait about 30 seconds, if you still get the same lights, call your internet support department.
If you are using a router, either wireless or wired, remove the power from the router for about 30 seconds then plug it back in.
Restart your computer.

Run yourself a hot bath.
Put on some relaxing music.
Get out when you're ready.
Apply some nice lotion to make your skin feel soft.
Get dressed.
Freshen your mouth.
Make yourself a nice hot drink.
Relax.
If you do not want to watch TV, just sit out in your back yard or by a window, and enjoy the fresh air or view while you drink your favorite hot drink.
Wind things down.
Go to sleep.

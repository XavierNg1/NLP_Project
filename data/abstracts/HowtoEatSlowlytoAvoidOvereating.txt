Reprogram your mind.
Remove as many processed foods from your pantry or food storage as possible.
Try to eat when you start feeling hungry.
Always relax before you start eating.
Drink a glass of water and/or eat a small bowl of light soup before your main dish.
Put the fork down after putting food in your mouth.
Concentrate on your food and really enjoy it.
Dedicate at least 20 minutes to finish your meal.
If you feel still a little bit hungry after this, stop anyway.

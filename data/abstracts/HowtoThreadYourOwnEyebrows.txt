Comb your eyebrow hair up to look for long our out of place hairs.
Make a loop with your thread.
Make a rectangle with the thread using your thumbs and pointer fingers as the corners.
Turn your right hand 3-4 times to make a little notch in the middle of the string.
Lightly cover your eyebrow in dry concealer.
Fit the string underneath the hairs you want to remove, keeping the center braid near the hair.
Open your right hand quickly to slide the braid towards the hair, snipping it.
Use the thread to clean your eyebrows into the right shape.
Apply some astringent or soothing lotion to your eyebrows.

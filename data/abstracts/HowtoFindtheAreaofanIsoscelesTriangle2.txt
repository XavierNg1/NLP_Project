Start with a side and an angle.
Divide the isosceles into two right triangles.
Use trigonometry to find the value of h. Now that you have a right triangle, you can use the trigonometric functions sine, cosine, and tangent.
Find the value of the remaining side.
Relate x to the base of the isosceles triangle.
Plug your values for h and b into the basic area formula.
Turn this into a universal formula.

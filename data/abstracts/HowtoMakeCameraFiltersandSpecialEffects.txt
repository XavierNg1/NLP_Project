Also you can remove the UV filter, fog the lens with your breath, and then, before it evaporates, screw the filter back on.

Use interesting pattern see-through cloths.
Go into a dark room (the bathroom with all the lights off would work well), turn on a black light and experiment.
Hand paint black and white photographs.
Look for good pictures on your home movies.
Take pictures through stained glass, glass candle lamps, or through a pitcher of water.
Take saran wrap and put it over your lens (it's best to use a rubber band to hold it).

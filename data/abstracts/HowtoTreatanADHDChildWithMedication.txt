The best medications for ADHD are usually stimulants.
Doctors will usually start on a low dose of medication and raise the dose if success ensues.

Start the medication on a weekend, that way you can watch for improvements and side effects.
A third dose will usually need to be taken after school to help with doing home work, sports and extra curricular activities, chores at home, playing with friends, enjoying free times and home behavior.
Sometimes long acting meds don't work as well by the afternoon and a child may need to take another small dose of a short acting med in the afternoon, especially if they are doing extra curricular activities or homework.

Most kids do experience side effects at first, they may feel funny or zombie like, they may feel sick or dizzy.
Some side effects last longer, these are usually difficulty falling asleep and a reduced appetite.
It your child is extra quiet or seems like a zombie after being on the meds a few days, this is not a side effect and this is not how the medication is supposed to work.
Kids will experience different side effects and different positive effects on different medications.
Sometimes non stimulant medications are used to treat ADHD such as risperdal (anti-psychotic medication), anti-depressants or even clonidine which is a blood pressure medication.

Try to keep sex fun and light instead of serious and strict.
Let her initiate oral sex after your discussion -- don't pressure here "now that you've talked.",
Incorporate oral sex slowly into your sex life instead of making it the spotlight.
Let her have control of her body, choosing her own speed and style.
Ask her what she enjoyed or what she'd like to try next time after sex.
Remember that these are extremely intimate acts, and may take some time to come out.
Understand that your partner might never enjoy or want to engage in oral sex.

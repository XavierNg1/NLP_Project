Make a spiritual place for yourself.
Pick up the following: incense, candles, a pillow to sit on, some sage, an egg and a bowl.
Sit down in your spiritual space and begin to light your candles and incense.
Put your hands in your lap and begin to scan your body.
Turn your mind inward.
Take the egg in your right hand (still feeling these emotions), and put it on your forehead.
Take the egg (still feeling all of those heavy thoughts in the egg) and then squash them in the bowl.
Take the sage and light it.
Now lay down.
Relax your mind.
While you are laying there, begin to communicate with your deity.
When you are ready to get up, do so.

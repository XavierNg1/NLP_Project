Understand the stakes.
Understand how to read the tells.
Develop the proverbial poker face.
Begin bluffing.
Count how many players are betting in the hand.
Bet, or raise someone else's bet, in the first round of betting, before the flop (the first 3 community cards).
Consider checking when good cards hit you, if checking is available, either on the flop or on the turn to act casually (checking is not available when someone has a bet that you must call/raise or fold/abandon the pot).
Remember that the bet following/on the river (the 5th community card) is the most important.
Suggest a pattern, playing a clean mind game/like a story with your bets, calls/raises.
Keep bluffing under your hat: Maintain/conceal the bluff on a weak hand.

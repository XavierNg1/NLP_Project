If you have never drawn a portrait before, do as Van Gogh did: draw yourself!,
Find a piece of paper that is larger than your head so your drawing will be the same size as your portrait subject, in this case yourself.
Look at how the upper lid is in relation to the lower one.
Don't worry about the rest of the head, hair or neck for now, but leave room on the paper for them later.
Draw a very light plumb line down the center of that space between the eyes to the bottom of the chin and up to the hairline.
Measure your eye-width unit and compare that distance to the distance between the inside corner of one eye to the bottom of the nose.
Look for the width of the cheekbones and make a light mark to indicate those, then work sideways to the ears.
Indicate the character of the chin and jawbone.

,
Indicate the height and width of the hair, and carefully draw the outline of it, adding masstone in the value of lightness or darkness of the hair.
When you have your proportions indicated, look at areas of light and dark in your subject.
Notice the shape and proportions of the upper and lower lids of the eyes.
Indicate the shape of the skull and the curves of the flesh that cover it by gradually shading the sides of the face and jaw, the eye sockets, the dip in the skull above the eyes, then pick out some of the lighter areas in the masstones of the hair.

,
Gently shade the shadow side of the nose and try to capture the unique shape of it, especially the tip.
Notice the dip between the two halves of the upper lip and gently shade the shadow side of that and the shadow side of the upper lip, toward the corner of the mouth.

,
Notice the areas of light and dark on the mouth and gently shade those; then the receding area below the lower lip.
Don't work from photos!

Remember that everyone's a person.
Don't try to convert them.
Don't make it a big point of the relationship.
Don't force an atheist to do something that makes them uncomfortable.
Remember there's a difference between atheists and anti-theists, and there's a very thick line between them.
Under no circumstances should you ever slander their beliefs.
Realize that you don't know what's going to happen to you until you die.

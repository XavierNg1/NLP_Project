Mix in a pinch of salt and just enough flour to make a sticky dough that holds together.
Knead the dough for about 10 minutes by hand (or with a dough hook on a stand mixer) until it is glossy and smooth.
Make the dough into a boule shape, if desired.
Form the dough into a rough ball shape, and pick it up from beneath with both hands.
Rotate the dough ball in your hands and continue stretching so that you have a taut top surface all around.
Turn the dough ball over, and find the “belly button.” The excess stretched dough beneath the ball should form something akin to this shape.
Allow for the final rise (or “proofing”) and bake as directed by your recipe.
Choose your bread and loaf shape, if not making your own bread.
Remove the top of the bread.
Remove the inner bread.
Don't waste the inner bread.

Remember the little things they say.
Determine your partner’s “Valentine’s Day style.” Some people would proudly walk down the street with a dozen roses and a helium Cupid balloon, while others would cringe at the very thought.
Ask yourself what makes your Valentine different.
Give yourself plenty of time.
Decide what would make your Valentine the happiest.
Confirm with your Valentine.
Talk with your Valentine about your gift policy.
Figure out if you are going to buy a gift or make a gift.
Write a thoughtful card.
Tell your Valentine exactly what they mean to you.

Do not iron your veil.
Steam out the wrinkles in your bathroom using a hot shower

Attach your veil to a hanger and let it hang on the door in your bathroom while you shower.
Lightly mist the wrinkles out using a spray bottle.
Place your veil in a dryer with a "delicate" setting.
If none of the above steps work, you can contact a local dry cleaner to help you.

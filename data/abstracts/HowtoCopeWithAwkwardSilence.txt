Consider whether you should even care that there is silence.
Ascertain the reason for the silence.
Abide in the silence.
Don't think that it's your responsibility to get things moving.
Try to excuse yourself.
Break the ice if the silence is simply due to not knowing the people around you very well.
Don't stand for mistreatment if the silence is a form of hostility.

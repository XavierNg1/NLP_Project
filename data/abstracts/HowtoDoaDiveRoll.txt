Master the candlestick.
Run through your approach and punch.
Execute a forward roll.
Begin your approach.
Prepare yourself to land in the air.
Use your hands to control your landing.
Let your momentum carry you.
Place your feet flat on the floor.
Stand up with your arms outstretched above your head.

Choose your music; make sure whatever song you choose is not DRM protected.
Make sure your photos and your music are in digital formats that will work with iTunes and iPhoto.
If you have a lot of photos in your iPhoto library, it may be easier for you to create a new album to sequester the photos you intend to use.
While still in your main library pull down the file menu and select "new slideshow.",
Click on the new album you created.
Once you have your photos in order, you can use the toolbar at the bottom to add transitions and effects.

When you’re reasonably happy with what you’ve got, keep iPhoto open, and open iTunes and create a new playlist.
Go back to iPhoto, and click on music in the toolbar below the photo display.
Preview your slideshow, and make adjustments to the number of photos, effects, etc.
Open a finder window, and find you movie.
If you want, you can download any of the fine free file converters available online to compress your video for iPod, for direct upload to facebook, or to make uploads to YouTube a bit faster.

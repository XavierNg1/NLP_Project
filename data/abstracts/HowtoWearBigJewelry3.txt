For big earrings you should try to coordinate with your outfit more so than with a necklace or bracelet.
Wear large, expensive earrings only to formal events to accessorize formal attire.
Wear feather earrings occasionally.
If you have more than one hole in your ear, put studs in the uppermost holes and your big earrings in the bottom one.
Be wary of your surroundings, since earrings that dangle tend to get caught on things.
Stay mindful of the amount of pressure the earrings exert on your ears.

Protect your work area from sanding dust.
Remove all metal hardware and store it in a box or a plastic re-sealable bag.
Sand the edges and corners using a medium or 100 grit sandpaper.
Go over the entire cabinet using a finer grit sanding sponge.
Clean the cabinet and your work area to get rid of any dust.
Consider applying some dark wax onto the weathered edges and into the corners.
Finish off with furniture wax.
Put your cabinet back together, if needed.

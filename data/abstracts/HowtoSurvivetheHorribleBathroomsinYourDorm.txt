If there's a bad smell, slow your breathing so you don't have to inhale as much.
Always wear your own shower-shoes, sandals, or flip-flops.
Touch as little as possible.
Be VERY careful when shaving.
When all the disgusting people on your floor decide not to flush the toilet or to dirty up the seat, don't hesitate to leave a sign on the door.
Make sure to clean the seat before sitting down.
If possible, wait to go to the bathroom until you are in a nicer facility.
Always wash your hands with soap after using the restrooms, and remind others to do the same.

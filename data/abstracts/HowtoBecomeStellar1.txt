Don't reject trends like the plague.
Look for outfits or pieces of clothing that make you feel good in your own skin, that are comfortable, and that match with your outfit.
Get some skirts and shorts in any fabric, as long as it is cute.
Look at vintage trends and analyze them carefully.
The most important part of stellar style is pre-loved clothes.
Look online or in some stores for environmentally friendly clothing, and/or clothes that have green messages on them, like "Save The Whales".

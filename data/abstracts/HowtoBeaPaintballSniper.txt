Determine if being a sniper is even worth playing.
Put on your goggles.

,
Take off the barrel sleeve(it should already be on).

,
Load/put your paint balls in your marker's Hopper.

,
Screw your CO2 Or Nitrogen Tank into The marker's ASA, or on to your remote line.

,
Do not take off safety until ready to shoot.

,
Look for a place to sit and wait.
In selecting an area, first choose an area that is going to bring targets towards you.
Second, choose an area in which your outline will not appear against a treeline, skyline, or any other type of horizon.
Once you find your hiding spot, make sure that you haven't already been spotted and are heading for an ambush.
Lay at your hiding spot and scope out people with your goggles.
If a target doesn't appear for roughly 25% of the game time, then your best bet is to move from your position to a new location.
If you find a person, aim your gun at him but do not shoot until you are ready to shoot.
Once you are in shooting range aim at your person.
If your first shot misses and the person does not know where you are, wait for another shot.
If your first shot misses and the person knows where you are follow with a volley of shots, and move away from your target if possible.

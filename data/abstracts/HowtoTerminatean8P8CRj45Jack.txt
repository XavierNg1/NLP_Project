Strip the cable of its protective outside jacket about 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm) from the end.
Expose the wire a little further.
If your cable has the small string, make a small cut in the jacket of the cable, making sure not to touch any wires, and then use the string to pull towards the fresh end of the cable exposing about 6 inches (15.2 cm) of cable.
If your cable does not have the small string, make a small cut in the jacket described above and GENTLY pull all of the wires together in one hand and pull the jacket in the opposite direction.
Untwist the wires completely to the jacket.
Terminate each wire.
Use a cable tester to assure that you correctly terminated all the wires.

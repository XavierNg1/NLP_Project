Distance yourself from them.
Remove their contact information and text messages from your phone.
Remove them from social media sites.
Stop talking about them and don’t allow yourself to think about them.
Ask your friends not to bring them up.
Avoid places they and their friends go.
Get rid of tangible traces of them.
Allow yourself to grieve and don’t get mad.
Know you’ll find someone else.

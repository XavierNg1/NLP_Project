Identify the routers with which you will be working.
Have a computer available to set up the routers.
Have one Ethernet cable (also called “network cables”) available for each device.
Make sure you have enough power outlets available to plug in two routers, plus any additional devices.

,
Unplug the power from both routers.
Run an Ethernet cable from the WAN port of Router 1 to the WAN/Internet port of the high-speed modem.If Router 1 doubles as your high-speed modem, you can skip this step.
Run an Ethernet cable from one of Router 1’s LAN ports to the computer’s Ethernet port.
Turn on the modem and router.
Open a web browser.
Bring up the router’s admin interface in your web browser.The web address you’ll be connecting to is Router 1’s IP address.
Log in using the router admin username and password combo.
Make sure that DHCP is enabled on Router 1.This will enable Router 1 to assign all of the IP addresses in your network.
Test your network and internet connection.
Remove the Ethernet cable between the Router 1 and the computer.
Plug in Router 2 and turn it on.
Run an Ethernet cable from the LAN port on Router 2 to the computer.
Open the router’s admin interface in a web browser.
Disable DHCP on Router 2.You are already using Router 1 to assign IP addresses.
Assign a new IP address to Router 2.As of now, there’s a good possibility that Routers 1 and 2 have the same default IP address.
Configure Router 2's Wi-Fi name and passkey to be identical to Router 1.If Router 2 is not a wireless router, don’t worry about this part.
Disconnect the power from Router 2.
Connect an Ethernet cable from a LAN port on Router 1 to the first LAN port on Router 2.
Plug Router 2 back in and turn it on.
Restart the computer that’s connected to Router 2.

,
Connect other computers and devices wirelessly, or via Ethernet cables to open LAN ports on either router.

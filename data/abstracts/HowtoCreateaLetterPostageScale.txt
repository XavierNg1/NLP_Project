Attach your rubber band to the end of the ruler (or item you are using instead of a ruler, see Things You'll Need section).
Put a piece of tape over the rubber band to help ensure that it does not slip or change position on the ruler.
Clip the paper clip onto the rubber band so that it will be able to hold onto a letter while hanging from the rubber band.
Move the ruler so the rubber band is just hanging off the edge of a table.
Make a calibration weight.
Find the balance.
Make a mark on the ruler.
Add more weight to the calibration.
Repeat the previous three steps for as many ounce marks you like.

,
Confirm your scale, if you like.
Clip an envelope on the paper clip and tell its weight.
See how much postage to put on the envelope.
You may need to add additional postage if your letter is smaller than 3x5", larger than 6.125x11.5, over 3.5 OZ, or more than 1/4" thick.

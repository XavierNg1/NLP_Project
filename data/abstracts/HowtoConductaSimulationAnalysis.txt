Write a Problem Statement: This step is essential.
Select Input Variables and Entities: Use the problem statement to create entities and variables for the simulation.
Make Constraints on Decision Variables: Begin to form your constraints1 on the decision variables.
Determine Output Variables: Establish what variables you want the simulation to output.
Collect Data from Real-Life System: Gather information from the system to input into the simulation.
Model Development: Develop a logical diagram/flowchart to visually see the progression of the simulation.
Select Simulation Software: Choose simulation software to run your model.
Model Verification: Run the simulation and compare the results to the actual system.
Model Experimentation & Optimization: Test the simulation to find the best possible solution to the problem.
Implementation of Simulation Results: Apply the results to the real-world system after determining the best solution based on the data input.

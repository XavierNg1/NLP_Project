Stand on your left foot with your right leg behind you in a T stop position.

Kick your right leg up so your right knee goes up in the air in front of you.
Swing your right foot over, and immediately bring your left foot over and extend it behind you.
As you swing your right foot over, you are going to jump with your left foot before the right foot hits the ground.
If you are stroking forward, do two or three powerful strokes and bend your knees.
If you are doing backwards crossovers, they should be left over right.
Practice landing.
When you land, be sure to keep your right foot straight.

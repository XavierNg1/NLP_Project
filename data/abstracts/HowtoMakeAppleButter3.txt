Wash, peel, core, and cut the apples.
Mix together the sugars, cinnamon, cloves, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl.
Put the apples into a crock-pot or slow cooker, then pour the sugar mixture over them.
Cover the crock-pot with a lid, and cook the apple mixture on high 1 hour.This will jump-start the cooking process.
Cook the apples over low heat for 9 to 11 hours, stirring occasionally, until they turn soft and brown.
Cook the apples uncovered for 1 more hour over low heat.
Blend or pur√©e the apple butter, if desired.
Pour the apple butter into jars, and store them in the fridge.
Finished.

Go to the Prize Corner camera.
The music box is the key.
Wait until it runs out.
Go to another camera.
Wait until he is all the way out.
When he is coming for you, you will hear a "Pop Goes The Weasel" begin to play.
If jumpscares freak you out, you may want to turn off your volume.
When his long song is over, you will have a few seconds before he jumpscares you.

And there you go!

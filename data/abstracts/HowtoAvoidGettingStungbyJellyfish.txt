Avoid areas populated by jellyfish.
Recognize risky conditions.
Heed warning signs.If you see a sign warning of jellyfish, it means that they have been spotted by officials.
Watch for purple flags.
Wear shoes when walking on the beach.Jellyfish and stray jellyfish tentacles can be very hard to see, and can remain venomous for a long time, even when washed ashore.
Wear protective lotions.
Wear a wetsuit.If you will be spending a lot of time in the water, or in deep waters, consider wearing more extensive coverage.The thick material of a wetsuit, and the fact that it will cover a large amount of your skin, makes it an effective deterrent to jellyfish stings.Clothing coated in petroleum jelly or similar substances is not a reliable protection against jellyfish stings.
Do not touch jellyfish that have washed ashore.
Swim near a lifeguard.Lifeguards are trained to help beachgoers in a variety of situations, including jellyfish attacks.
Drive jellyfish away.
Leave the water immediately if you see or suspect a jellyfish.

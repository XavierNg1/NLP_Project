Before you can even think about going on to hard mode, you must beat "Through the Fire and Flames" in medium.
After beating it, you'll need to learn how to use all five frets.
Now go into practice mode and work on "Hit Me With Your Best Shot" in hard mode.
If you can get up to 85% in practice mode, try doing it in quick play.
You need to start hitting the back button instead of tilting the guitar.
Try getting 96% in a song in medium, then try that song in hard mode.
Start a hard mode career and get up as far as you can.

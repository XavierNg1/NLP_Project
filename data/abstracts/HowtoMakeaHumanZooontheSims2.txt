Go to Build Mode.
You have 2 choices here.
Make a family of 1 person and call him Zoey Zookipa.
Let Zoey live his life in the neighborhood well.
You will probably see messages like, "You invited me to spend the night, but I'm leaving!".
Make a "death area".
If you want it to get really wild, put stray animals in the zoo.
Pretty soon, the Grim Reaper will show up.
Or you could create another Sim, make Zoey have WooHoo with her, get pregnant with children (type forcetwins to have twins) and then put her in the zoo, along with the kids who you shall name Jenny and Maurice, no matter what gender they are.
Have evil fun!

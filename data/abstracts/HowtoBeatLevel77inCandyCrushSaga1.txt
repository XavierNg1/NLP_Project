Prioritize vertical striped candies.
Use wrapped/striped combos to hit the middle section.
If you can, focus on the chocolate first.
Don't forget to look for combinations in the middle section.
Use color bombs if many jelly squares are the same color.
If you have no other moves, clear candy near the bottom of the board.

Do your Parental Observation.
Observe and record likes and preferences regardless if they seem "vocational" or not.
Teach your child, even before transition begins, about what a job is like through incidental teaching.
Finding the expert transition team.
The sequence of vocational transition should look like the following:


Formal assessment and testing at the time the transition begins
Using that assessment to develop goals.
Move on to job shadowing, which is following someone for a set period of time to observe how the person does the job.
Situational assessment: After, through job shadowing, some jobs are narrowed down, setting it up that the student can work with supervision (a job coach) to "try out" the job for a few days to a few weeks.

,
Work Experience: Like situational assessment, but for a longer period of time, and a stipend is factored in often by the job coach so that it becomes more real as a job with money involved.

,
Placing the student on a job that has been determined by all of the above, the student's abilities (fine and gross motor skills, endurance) and preferences.
Permanent Job Placement towards the end of transition.

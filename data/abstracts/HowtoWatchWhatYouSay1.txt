Work on your listening skills.
Close your mouth when it opens.
Put yourself in the other personâ€™s shoes.
Ask yourself if what you intend to say is true, necessary, and kind.
Speak freely but not thoughtlessly with loved ones.
Take ownership of your statements by prefacing them.
Make an effort to become more articulate.

Avoid one-up-man-ship: such as starting to do your laundry before s/he gets on it, after his/her mentioning wanting to do laundry soon—especially if it's at night, when you would force the other person to wait for the next day.
Clean up the house quietly—for example at night, when the other is talking about heading off to bed.

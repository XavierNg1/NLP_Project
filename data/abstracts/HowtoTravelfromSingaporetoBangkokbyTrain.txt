In Bangkok, go to any travel agent that has a sign showing "train tickets" or to the train station.
Buy tickets to Butterworth, Malaysia.
Set the days in advance and get the tickets as early as possible.
The train leaves Butterworth at 9:30pm and arrives in KL around 6:30am the next day.
Arriving in KL you have 3 options.
The KL to Singapore trip takes about 7-8 hours.
Again it is advisable to buy your return ticket to KL IN KL.
Several private bus companies will offer cheaper trips that don't stop in Butterworth, KL, or Hat Yai.
Plan for at least 2 full days, possibly 2.5 depending on which trains you get.

Spot the toxic waste before it gets too close.
Trust your gut-- if someone makes you upset and uncomfortable, make some space.
Pay attention to body language and tone of voice.
Keep your eyes and ears peeled for hotheads.
Stay away from the cynics.
Stand away from the attention seekers.
Keep the gossip girls and rumor mill men at bay.

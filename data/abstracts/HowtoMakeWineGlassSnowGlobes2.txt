Clean and prepare stemware.
Trace the stemware mouth on the cardboard.
Assemble the snow globe “scene.” You may want to paint the cardboard disc and then mount (hot glue) trees, snowmen or people to the cardboard base.
Fill bottom of stemware with glitter and/or faux snow a quarter of the way.
Apply hot glue around the mouth of the stemware.
Turn the winter scene (that was mounted on the cardboard disc) upside down on top of the stemware mouth.
Allow glue to dry and then turn over to watch the snowfall!

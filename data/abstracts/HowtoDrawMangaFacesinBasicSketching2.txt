Start off with a circle for the head.
Now draw a vertical line that divides the circle into half that is a little longer than the diameter of the circle and a horizontal one that the two lines make a 90Â° angle.
Draw the chin with the help of these two lines.
Draw another horizontal line a little higher than the first one.
Drawing the eyes is the most difficult of them all.
For the eyes, draw two ovals between the two lines.
Put a little line on the point where the first vertical line cuts the circle.
Before adding the mouth, you should erase the base lines.
Draw the mouth.
Add the eyebrows.

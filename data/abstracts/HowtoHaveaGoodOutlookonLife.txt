Overcome your social fear.
Act like you don't care or better still ignore people who put you down.
Be yourself and have fun in life; stop trying to impress everyone.
Be comfortable with who you are.
Do what makes you happy.
Know that people change and you will change.
Make the most of the rest of your life.

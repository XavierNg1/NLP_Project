Place the tea light candle or LED toy inside each of the eggs you're turning into a firefly.

Slip the non-curled ends of the firefly through these little holes.
Draw or paint on the firefly's eyes or use googly eyes which you can buy at craft stores.

Add wings.
Create more fireflies and you're all done!

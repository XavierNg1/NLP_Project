Get educated!,
Figure out your weak points, and attack them full on until you have overcome them!,
Research your subject.
Research the style.
Start loose and gestural; so much so, that all you are doing at first is simple shapes inside compositional borders (these borders should emulate the final piece's proportions).
Warm up!,
Pay close attention to your composition, the rough stage is for this very purpose.
Make the colors good.
Pay attention to the quality of your materials.
Select and use only the details you need, the rest of added embellishment is just added distraction and wasted time.
The more preliminary pieces and roughs, the better the final piece.

,
If it is a good piece, make sure people know who did it.
Experiment and express yourself.

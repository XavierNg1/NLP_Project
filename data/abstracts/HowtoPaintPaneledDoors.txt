If possible, try to remove the doors from their hinges before beginning to paint.
Wash the door thoroughly and let it dry.
Lay the door you are working on across two sawhorses or another other type of support to keep it horizontal.
Remove the doorknob.
Make any repairs needed in the door.
Apply a stain-blocking primer if it is needed.
If you will be working with oil-based paint, you can speed the work by applying the paint with a roller, then spreading it with a brush.
Follow the right sequence when applying the paint: paint the edge first, wiping off the underneath face of the door when finished; paint all the panels, working from top to bottom; paint the cross pieces; finish with the stiles (the vertical sides that hold the panels in place).
To give your doors the best possible appearance, touch up any drips or runs that appear.
Let the paint dry completely.Rehang the door and reinstall the doorknob.

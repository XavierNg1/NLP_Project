Sleep on a pillowcase made from silk or satin.
Brush your hair from root to tip for several minutes before going to bed.
Avoid placing bobby pins, clips, or elastic bands into your hair before bedtime.
Treat your hair with deep conditioner before bedtime and leave in overnight.
Lie down to sleep as you normally do and fan your hair out around the pillow.
Consider using a neck pillow and positioning your body so your hair hangs over the edge of your bed.
Use a flat iron to smooth and straighten any waves, frizz, and kinks that result from the previous nightâ€™s sleep.
Finished.

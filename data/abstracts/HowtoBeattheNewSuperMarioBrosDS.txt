Know the controls of the game in order to play.
There are 8 worlds and each world has a theme.
After watching the intro you will have to play level 1.

,
Walk along until you see four boxes.
Keep practicing.
As you progress you may notice random mushrooms along the map.
After a couple of levels you will have to play in a tower.
After a few levels you will come to a castle.
As you keep progressing you'll notice that you don't go to World 4 or 7.
The last World 8 castle is the hardest.
If you make it then you will have to face Bowser and Bowser Junior.
Well done!

Open up Microsoft PowerPoint.
Add a title, and a subtitle.

,
Create a rectangle, then press s while it is selected.

,Type in, 'Start' or 'Play'

,
Add another slide by pressing Control+M.

,
Go back to the first slide, then add a hyperlink to the rectangle, by: right click shape/hyperlink/place in this document/slide 2.

,
On the second slide, you could either: put the main menu (which requires Play, Instructions and Info to put in), or you can just start the game.

,
Okay, now for the quiz...

,
Insert/shapes/rectangle.
Insert/shapes/oval.
Then, insert/shapes/rectangle.
Now add 2 slides, by pressing control+M.

,
One slide should be saying, 'Game Over!',
Add hyper link to the right answer in the previous slide to the other question (which is question 2) and the other 3, to the 'Game Over!',
For the second question, you might add something like this: "Put your cursor on the square".
To make that, insert/shapes/action buttons/custom.
Add another slide, then add another custom action button, close to the other one, by copying and pasting it, from the previous slide.
Now that's done, keep on adding random questions.

Find a table, lots of plastic cups, and plenty of water.
Just before the race begins, make sure you have 20-50 cups ready for the first crowd of runners.
When the runners come by, be ready!,
Fill those cups fast!,
Watch out for shy people.
Manners aren't the runners' priority, and they shouldn't be yours, either.
Expect to be splashed.
Have fun!

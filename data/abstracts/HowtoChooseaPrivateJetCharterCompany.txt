Identify the Right Charter Broker or Operator.
"There are a number of charter brokers who appear to have many aircraft but in reality are serving in a capacity similar to a travel agent.",
Charter brokers are not FAA authorized and do not have any aircraft under their control.
Validate the Charter Company.
Visit the Company: This may not always be possible, but you will learn a tremendous amount of information about a company by meeting their people, seeing their facility, and touring a few aircraft.
Look for Good Customer Service: Ideally, there should be a single person responsible for your trip.
Select an Aircraft: Often, a charter company will provide pictures of an aircraft under consideration for a trip.
Check up on your Pilot: Find out what the provider's standards are for minimum pilot hours.
Find Out How Much it Will Cost: As the details of your needs become more specific, you should be able to get a clear quote, not a vague estimate that leaves room for surprises on the final invoice.

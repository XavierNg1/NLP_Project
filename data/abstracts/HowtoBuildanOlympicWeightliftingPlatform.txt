Place the first set of plywood boards on a solid, flat surface.
Place the second set of plywood boards on top of the first set.
Use the package of 1 1/2 screws for this step.
Have two people ready––this step requires two people.
With the tape measure, straight edge and utility knife, cut the rubber mats into four 2' x 4' sections (see image).

Place two 2' x 4' cuts of rubber mat on each side of the platform(see image 6a).
Attach.
Remove the nice board from the center and place it on the ground in front of the almost complete platform.

Making sure that the nice top board is flush with the rest of the platform, drill in some screws through the bottom of the platform.

All done!

Decide what kind of temple-stay you would like to make.
If you would like to stay in the temple for spiritual reasons, a different approach is necessary.
Sometimes temples take a more informal approach to retreats, whereby lay practitioners may stay at the temple at any time and follow the temple schedule and keep certain precepts.
Ask what you will need/be allowed to bring, and about any specific temple rules.

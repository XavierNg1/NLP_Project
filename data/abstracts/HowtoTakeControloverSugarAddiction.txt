Take care of yourself...first.
Keep your blood sugar stable.
Consider yourself as detoxxing.
Don't focus on the loss of weight.
Know your worth.
Create an environment that will support you.
Learn about your body and what makes you feel good, bad, or indifferent.
Don't go with the fake sugar.
Don't stress if you slip.
Learn to forgive yourself.

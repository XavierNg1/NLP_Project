Install the Microsoft Robotic Studio.
Create a new blank service


Create a blank service from Start, Programs, Microsoft Robotics Studio (1.5)
Run MSRS Command Prompt
Type ‘md My’ to create a new directory for your projects
Type ‘cd My’ to move into that directory
Type ‘dssnewservice /service:Simplest’

,
Add some basic handling to your project so we will reference a drive partner


Type ‘cd Simplest’ to move into your new services’ directory
Type ‘Simplest.sln’ to open your service in Visual Studio C#
Open the Solution Explorer (ctrl-w, s)
Add a reference to RoboticsCommon.proxy
Open the file Simplest.cs from the Solution Explorer
Add a new using statement at the top ‘using drive = Microsoft.Robotics.Services.Drive.Proxy;’
Add a partner reference below _mainPort declaration ‘’
Add a port for this partner just below the line you just added ‘private drive.DriveOperations _drivePort = new drive.DriveOperations();’
Add another port just below that one ‘private drive.DriveOperations _driveNotify = new drive.DriveOperations();’
This port will be what we use to actually handle notifications that are sent to us.
Now let’s listen to this partners notification messages


We want the _driveNotify port to get messages sent to the _drivePort.
Now that we’re wired up with the partner so it will listen for the update message we want to connect to the simulation environment.

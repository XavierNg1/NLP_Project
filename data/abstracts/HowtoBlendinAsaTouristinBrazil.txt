If you walk down the street, even if you are lost, walk confidently and purposefully, look forward, don't show that you are hesitating.
When you are sightseeing, don't stare at the map in the middle of the street.
Do not flash your camera or other gadgets.
Leave expensive jewelry, designer sunglasses, bags, baseball caps, what have you, at home.
Always carry your purse under your arm, not on your arm, in your hand or on your back.
Look around, see how the locals dress.
Never give money to begging children, their parents spend it on drugs.
Make a photocopy of your passport, keep it with you at all times.
If you go by taxi, print off your itinerary from google maps.
Do not blindly trust the locals.

Define your skin type: dry, oily, normal or combination


If you have DRY SKIN: Invest in a rich gel cleanser, as these seem to work better for people with dry or sensitive skin.
Use your chosen cleanser fitted to your skin type NO more than twice a day.
If you want, you can use toner.
Moisturizer time!,
If you use any spot/acne treatments, now is the time to use them.
Finished.

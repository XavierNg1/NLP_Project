Fill your vase 3/4 full with tepid water.
Arrange the greens by holding your one tall green in middle of your hand and work around the edges building a hand held look with your greens.
Pick your tallest, straightest, tightest closed rose for your first placement.
Select your next 5 roses based on tightness of head, height, and straightness of stem.
Measure the six remaining roses to be about 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2Â cm) shorter than your tallest rose.
Fill between the five roses aiming towards the bottom of the vase, so roses will be seen from every angle around the vase, once the arrangement is complete.
Pick the prettiest, fullest, most open rose to be the center of the front of your arrangement.
Fill in the holes with the filler flowers.
Move away from the arrangement and squint your eyes to make sure you do not see any "holes" that need a little color.
Fill in with extra greenery to make sure no mechanics (tape, rose stems, etc) are showing, making sure to leave airholes.

Enjoy your arrangement!

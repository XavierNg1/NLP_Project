Measure your forehead.
Measure your cheekbones.
Measure your jawline.
Measure your face-length.
Ask yourself three questions.
Look for an “oval face.” An oval face will have a length that is roughly one and half times greater than your face width.
Look for a “round face.” A round face will be the same width and length.
Look for an “oblong face.” An oblong face will be longer than it is wide.
Look for a “heart-shaped face.” This face shape is very common.
Look for a “square face.” A square-shaped face has a length almost equal to its width.
Look for a “triangle face.” Triangular faces will be characterized by a large jawline, slightly smaller cheekbones, and smallest forehead.
Choose hats for an “oval face.” Feel free to try all kinds of hats!,
Choose hats for a “round face.” Add some asymmetry to your look.
Choose hats for an “oblong face.” Try a hat with a flared brim and low crown, such as a sunhat, a cloche, or a fedora with a large brim.
Choose hats for a “heart-shaped face.” Go with a medium brimmed hat, such as a fedora with a medium sized brim, a boater, a cloche, a homburg, a beanie, or a beret.
Choose hats for a “square face.” Experiment with circular styles.
Choose hats for a “triangle face.” Feel free to try many hats.

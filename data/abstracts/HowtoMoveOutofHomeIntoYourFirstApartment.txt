Decide whether you will be sharing your living area with others.
You should begin looking for places months before you actually move.
When looking at a place, keep in mind that you're probably not going to get a palace.
Make an inventory of the state of the house together with the landlord.
Draw up a budget plan.
Move in.
Discuss your old room with your parents - you may want to overhaul your old stuff, getting rid of junk, taking your favorite and most used stuff to your new place.
Set up utility (bills) accounts for water, gas and electricity.
Last and not least, make sure you can afford to pay all your bills once you move, that your employment is secure, and that you will have enough money to live comfortably and not struggle to pay rent, utilities, food, gas for your car, and insurance.

Take a day to appreciate your environment.
Be reasonably nice to everyone.
Get to know your teachers.
You need to make friends.
Pay attention in class.
If your first day in the school is the first day of the new year, then some people will notice you, especially if it is a small school.
Don't worry about getting to know the school too much.
When you talk to those of the opposite (or same) sex, don't flirt too much before finding out if they're already with someone.
For your first lunch, talk a lot to people in the class right before lunch.
For the first week at your new school, be nice to everyone and talk to everyone, even if they seem weird.
Pay attention in class and try hard in school.
Join a few clubs or sports and make more friends in this way.
After you've talked to someone a few times, ask for their contact information.
Please the other kids.
Be consistently level-headed inside and out, and don't over-think people or situation.

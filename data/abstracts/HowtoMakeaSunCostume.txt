Cut out two circles that are wider than your torso.
Poke two holes on the top of each circle.
Lace twine (or other strong rope) through the holes you just made.
Tie both sides of the rope to the other piece of cardboard so that the pieces of cardboard are connected.
Create the sun's rays.
Glue or staple these rays around each circle.
Paint each circle the colors of the sun.
If you want your sun to have character, draw eyes and a smile on the front circle.

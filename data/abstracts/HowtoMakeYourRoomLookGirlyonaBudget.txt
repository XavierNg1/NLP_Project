Clean your room.
Organize your things.
If you can paint your room, paint it a light purple or maybe a bold pink, lime green, teal, teal and brown, pink, light blue, or any other colors you like.
If you can't paint your room, that's okay.
Showoff in style.
Get a fun rug.
Get some wall stickers.
Have a good smelling air freshener that is cute to the eyes, and also smells nice.
Get some cute curtains that are in contrast to the walls but match your comforter or rug.
Do not forget the mirror and the wall.
Remember this is your room, so let it reflect you and your personality.

Have your friends gather things they don't want, e.g. rugs, bedding, pillows, stuffed animals, and trade!

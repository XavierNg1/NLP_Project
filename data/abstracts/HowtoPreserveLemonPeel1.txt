Choose the freshest lemons you can find; hand pick, if possible.
Sort the lemons into two groups, and then wash and dry them.
Store whole, blemish-free lemons in a plastic bag in the refrigerator.
Cut around blemished sections of the lemons.The "cut into lemons" will need to be used first for your project, or stored in the refrigerator until you use them.Blemishes are not always terrible, but if you are going to be making something like jelly and or sugared lemon, you'd probably not want to eat an unsightly dark spot on a piece of lemon, so it's best to just dispose of them.

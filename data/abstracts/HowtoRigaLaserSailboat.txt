Get all your parts together.
Put together both the pieces of your mast.
Slide the sail over the mast.
Insert the battens into the sail, they should slide in and then you push your end of the batten down so it won't fall out.

,
Stand up the mast.
Get your boom, and put its front end into the gooseneck (the little pin sticking out of your mast).
While still holding the boom on the gooseneck, walk around to the flapping end of the sail.
Attach the clew-tie-down (a small line that wraps around the ring the outhaul is attached to) and wrap it around the boom and tie it so that the clew is as close to the boom as it can be while still being able to slide back and forth along the boom.

,
Attach the boom vang (This piece holds the boom down while you're sailing).
Rig the mainsheet.
Just before you put the laser in the water, check to be sure the hull plug is screwed into the drain hole in the stern.
Launch.

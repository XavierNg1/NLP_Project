Get a certain amount of tea bags, depending on paper.
Fill a cup of water as if you are using it to heat it up for tea to drink.
Place the teabags in your cup of water.

,
Take the cup of water and place it in the microwave for one minute.

,
Once the cup of water is done heating up, let the tea bags sit in the water for one minute and pull them out of the cup and place it on the plate for ten minutes or until it cools.
Now, place the paper on a plate (before this you can crumple the paper up to make it look a little older).

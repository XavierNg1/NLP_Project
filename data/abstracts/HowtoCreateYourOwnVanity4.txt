Make your vanity look more interesting by decorating it.
Add some flowers if you'd like to add a touch of freshness.
Get some candles if you'd like to add some ambience.
Hang some framed artwork to either side of the mirror if you have room.
Consider draping something above your mirror for a mire girlish touch.
Keep your vanity tidy and leave out only your statement pieces.

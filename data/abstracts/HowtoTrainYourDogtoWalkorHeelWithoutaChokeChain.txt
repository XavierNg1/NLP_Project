Buy a harness for your dog.
Get your dog's favorite toy and treats as leads.
Start your training in an area with few distractions, and after your dog has already exercised in some way (playing fetch with you, running in the park, etc.),
Every time your dog looks away, say his name excitedly, shake the toy or treat, and say "Let's go!",
If the dog gets ahead of you and starts to pull, take a few steps backwards (look behind you, first!),
Use lots of praise with your dog, as long as the leash is loose.
If your dog is consistently pulling, you may want to try using a head halter; these work very well also if your dog is comfortable wearing it (it may need to be desensitized first).

Remember that you need to give your dog enough slack in the leash that is loose when the dog is walking close to you.
Remember, do not use any harsh discipline like hitting, jerking on the leash or yelling when your dog doesn't follow.

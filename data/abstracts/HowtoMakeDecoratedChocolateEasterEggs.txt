Melt enough white chocolate to fill one plastic egg.
Melt a few coloured wafers (any colour you want, or rainbow) and drizzle into both parts of the plastic egg.
Once both are swirled, make sure they are both completely full, and as quick as you can shut the egg.
Now, place your egg into ice water to cool.
After waiting for the egg to cool, (about 15 minutes in ice water, longer without ice water), Open the eggs.
Now, melt a bit more of the coloured wafers (any colour, preferably matching the egg's swirls).Now your eggs are ready for Easter!

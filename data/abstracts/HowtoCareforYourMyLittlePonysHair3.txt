As always,Â wash your pony.
Brush your pony's hair while it's still a little damp, and then divide the mane into four equal strips.
Divide the tail into strips as well.
Wrap each strip of hair around a straw, beginning at the end of the hair, and spiraling up the straw as you go, so that the curls will coil downward.
Follow the same procedure for the tail, wrapping the curls from the bottom upward.

Leave your pony to dry overnight.

Think on a deep level (get to a place where you can completely focus on something, then focus on this).
Start by planning your day or week (what ever is easiest for you) then, pick out each situation you might get into where you need to ask these questions.
Take the easiest situations and write out a short script of how a conversation would typically go (with all the positive and negative parts).
After you've scripted out a short or long conversation (again, what ever is easier), rewrite it so you can fit in some OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS!,
Practice using open ended questions.
Apply your trial and error on the many situations that matter just a little until you have it as a habit.

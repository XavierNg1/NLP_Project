Pretreat your carpet with a spray-on pet stain remover.
Lift the handle from the water compartment at the front of the Proheat cleaner.
Pull the plastic lever on the back of the container and lift the top section out.
Remove the plastic solution container from the back of the carpet cleaner.
Set the dial on the front of the machine to “floor cleaning” rather than “tools.” Any time you use an attachment, you need to change this setting.

,
Use the dial at the top of the machine to set the intensity of your cleaning, such as “rinse,” “normal cleaning,” or “heavy cleaning.”

,
Remove all the furniture from the carpet you are about to clean.

,
Plug in the machine and start at the area furthest away from you.
Go to the first section of the carpet.
Step on the small lever on the bottom left edge so that the cleaner reclines and you can push it.
Depress the trigger and push the cleaner forward as far as you can comfortably reach.
Let the trigger go and make several “dry passes” when the cleaner and water are not being used.
Repeat until the area of the carpet is cleaned.
Switch the dial to “tools” to use the attachments to clean smaller areas.
Allow the carpet to dry completely before replacing furniture and walking on it.

,
Pay close attention to the dirty water in the front container on your Bissell cleaner.
Turn the cleaner off.
Refill the water basin with hot water.

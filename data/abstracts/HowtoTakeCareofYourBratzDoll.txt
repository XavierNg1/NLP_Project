Remember to never use a plastic fine toothed comb to brush your doll's hair.
If you know how to sew, you can make lots of awesome outfits for your doll.

Avoid making it dirty.
Be careful with dressing Barbies or My Scene dolls in Bratz clothes as Barbies are bigger, the clothes may rip, so don't ever try to force the clothes on.
Make sure you take along your Bratz case or a bag to carry them in if you ever take your Bratz to school.
Keep all marking pens, pens, and highlighters away from your doll.
Don't put any hair products on their hair except for the Bratz Magic Hair Products that are meant for using on the doll's hair.
If you have a pet like a dog (that chews almost everything) keep your Bratz doll as far away from it as possible, or else it may chew on their hair or rip off arms or legs.
Get you doll's hair little damp and brush it for a little every night right before you go to bed.
Have somewhere safe to put your dolls when you are done playing with them.
If you want your dolls hair to stay looking great never over brush it.

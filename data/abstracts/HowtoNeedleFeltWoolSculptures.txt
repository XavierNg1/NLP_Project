Gather the materials and supplies.

To make a basic egg shape, start by preparing the wool batting.

Make a basic needle felted shape by stacking 4 sheets and rolling them into an oval shape while compressing as much air as you can out of the wool.

Lay the shape on the felting pad and hold on firmly as you begin needle felting using the 40 triangle needle.

Continue to needle felt the shape until the loose fibers are all felted down.

With a basic shape completed, start building on it.

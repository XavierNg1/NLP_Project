Pay attention to the response during high-profile racial incidents.After a racially-related incident, many will try to justify the situation in order to make the racial minority look like the villain.
Stay attentive to structural racism.It is easy to detect racism when examining the social structures of society.
Look for double standards.If a racist sees someone of their own race do or say something harmless, but worthy of criticism, they might pay it no mind; however, if someone of another race does the same thing, the racist person might be extremely angry and critical.

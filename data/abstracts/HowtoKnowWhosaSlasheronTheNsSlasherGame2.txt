Pay attention and always be playing.
Act like a plain ol' camper, not a special role or slasher!,
Don't trust anyone!,
Don't tell ANYBODY who the slashers are if you know.
Don't lie to yourself.
Watch closely who's on and who's not.
Don't reveal any personal info or slashers may slash you next!

,
Don't say you know who the slasher is or you think you know who is/have clues.
Listen to others and not majority.
Don't give up!,
If you don't know who might be a slasher, try killing off a person that's always been offline.
Also, if 2-4 people are blaming other people a LOT, they are most likely slashers trying to protect themselves.

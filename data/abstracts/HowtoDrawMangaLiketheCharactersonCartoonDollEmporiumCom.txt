To create the head shape, draw an oval-circle shape.
From the right side of the circle, draw a small line going downwards.
Just above half-way up the circle shape, draw a horizontal line, maybe curving slightly (but for it to curve is not important).
For the first eye, sketch an oval to the left of the vertical line, so it's touching it.
On this step, add more detail to the eyes.
Add detail.
Add the body.
With the body in place finish with the back of the hair.
Whether you do this step or not is your choice.
And now, you've come to the end.

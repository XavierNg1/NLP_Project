Start by laying out all the things that you would put in your purse, work bag, tote bag, or school bag.

If there's a zipper inside your bag that big enough, put important things like your passport and boarding passes in that pocket.

Put your book-like items in first.

Pack the main part of your bag.

After you fit everything in your bag, take out things that you don't need.

If there's a front pocket with the keychain and pencil holders, stick a pencil and a pen in there, just in case.

Put things like lip balm, a mini lotion, sunscreen, and eye drops in the front pocket.

Now you're ready for your trip!

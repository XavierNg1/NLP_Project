Understand that, for estimation purposes, 1 meter = 1.1 yards.
Write down your number of meters, followed by a plus sign.
Multiply your number of meters by .1 by moving the decimal one place to the right.
Add the .1 to your original number of meters to get your final answer.
Consider subtracting away your overestimation for an even more precise calculation.

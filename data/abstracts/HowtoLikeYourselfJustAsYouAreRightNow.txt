Accept that feeling low and fed-up is something that happens to most people.

Tell yourself that it is actually okay and quite normal to become apathetic, bored, miserable, unhappy etc.

Go with your mood.

Ask yourself if you want to continue to wallow.

Get up.

Think about one small thing you can do right now that will keep you busy for a few minutes.

Pledge a few minutes of this dreary day to getting up - away from your keyboard, bed, sofa, TV or game console - and doing this thing.

Tell yourself that you deserve the very best self-care you can give yourself.

Understand that you are up now and you have spent a few minutes trying to achieve a new goal.

Take a deep breath.

Plan something for the rest of your day.

Take that one small step towards doing it.

Once you become involved in doing something you'll find your bad mood or sad feelings or just-can't-be-bothered feelings will change.

That is why people have to give themselves a bit of a kick up the backside sometimes.

There is no overnight miracle cure.

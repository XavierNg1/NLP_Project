Know what all-in, in the dark is.
Use this play in certain situations when: 1) the blinds are very big, 2)  pot odds are favorable, 3) your opponent is weak or tight, or if 4) your stack is big and you are the table bully.
To do this trick, decide to do it.
Follow the play.
If you are still in the game, keep playing.
Still in the game, and with a playable hand, be cautious.
Study the distribution of events and probability.

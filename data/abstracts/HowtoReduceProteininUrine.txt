Take steps to reduce your blood pressure.Elevated blood pressure puts a lot of strain on the kidneys, and since persistent proteinuria (elevated protein in the urine) is almost always linked to a problem in the kidneys, reducing your blood pressure can help the problem significantly.
Opt for a blood pressure medication.Essentially everyone who is diagnosed with a level of kidney disease or kidney disfunction (which are the primary reasons for persistently elevated protein in the urine) receives a blood pressure medication from their doctor.
Ask your doctor about other medical treatments.For instance, if you have an underlying autoimmune disease causing kidney problems (and hence protein in your urine), you may need medications to suppress your immune system.
Diagnose the cause.
Determine which type of "proteinuria" (elevated protein in the urine) you are experiencing.There are three types of proteinuria, and the good news is that two out of the three require no treatment and usually resolve all on their own, with time.
Evaluate any transient stresses you may be experiencing.As previously mentioned, if you are currently ill with a fever, exercising more than usual, or suffering from other acute stressors in your life, the protein levels in your urine may be elevated transiently as a result of this stress.
Request repeat urine tests.It is key to obtain repeat urine tests.
Get blood tests.Additional diagnostic testing that your doctor may perform includes blood tests, particularly if he or she suspects that you may have underlying kidney disease or other health problems.
Get a kidney biopsy.
Be aware that protein in the urine during pregnancy is another matter.

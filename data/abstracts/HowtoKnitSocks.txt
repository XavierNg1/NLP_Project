Choose the yarn you'd like to use.
Choose double-pointed needles to fit your wool.
Try this cast-on, which means that you won't have to sew the toe up later.
Take a third needle and knit each loop on the first needle.
Notice how the stitches, when knitted on each needle, are suspended between the two double pointed needles.
Using the third needle (the floating needle), knit 1, make 1 (using the loop between stitches).
Do the same on the second casting-on needle.
Remember this pattern of adding a stitch at the second and penultimate stitch on each side.
Knit until the sock is about 4cm (1.5") from the back of the heel when tried on.
Begin working the heel.
Get all your needles back to normal again, with four active needles (symmetrical) and one floating needle.
Continue to knit the whole four needles as you were before you started the heel.
Continue to knit until you're an inch or two from the top, and then begin to k2p2 (knit 2, purl 2) for the ribbing.
Cast off very loosely, even looser than you think might be needed, because tight casting-off can mean that your sock is hard to get on and uncomfortable.

If you are going to be on a computer for longer than an hour, you should have an LCD monitor.
Don't stare hard at the screen.
Use eye drops in your eyes.
Keep at least two feet away from the monitor.
Try to stand up at least once an hour.
You can always try wearing monitor glare prevention glasses which help.

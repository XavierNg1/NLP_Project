Search the internet for fonts to download.
Usually when you download a font, it comes in a zipped file.
Unzip this to a specific location.
Now that you have the font unzipped to the desktop, you need to move it into the Fonts folder for your computer.
Just drag the file from the desktop over to the open Fonts window.
After restarting any programs that use Fonts, you can open them back up to see the newly installed font.

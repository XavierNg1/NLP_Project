Consider weight loss.Post-traumatic arthritis is normally caused by an injury (often a sports injury, or an injury at work), and it is exacerbated (or made worse) by continual weight bearing and stress and strain on the joint.
Choose lower-impact sports and activities.Particularly if the injury that first led to your arthritis was sports-related, you may want to consider avoiding this sport, or reducing our involvement in it, to prevent further injury to the same joint or to other joints.
Ask for modified duties at the workplace.
See a physiotherapist.One way to reduce the pain in your joint from post-traumatic arthritis is to see a physiotherapist who can prescribe exercises for you to strengthen the muscles surrounding your injured joint.
Modify your diet.Consuming more turmeric and ginger (both of which can be used as spices on your food) helps to combat inflammation and the pain from post-traumatic arthritis.
Consult a naturopath.There are a variety of supplements that have been shown to help with osteoarthritis (the type of arthritis that most often develops post-traumatically).

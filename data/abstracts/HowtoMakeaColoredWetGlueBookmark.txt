Get a pencil box.
Find some markers, and fill the rectangle with whatever you want.
Now that it's colored with marker, find a bottle of wet white glue, like Elmer's glue, that dries clear, and squeeze a little bit of it into the recessed area.
Wait for the glue to dry, a day or two later.
Finished.

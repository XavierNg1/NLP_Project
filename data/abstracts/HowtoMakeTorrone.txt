Prepare a large, clean working surface to use for making the torrone.
Line the bottom of a 9 by 13 inch (228.6 mm by 330.2 mm) baking dish with edible wafer paper.
Place 3 cups of whole blanched almonds (680.4 g) on a large rimmed baking sheet.
Put 1/4 tsp.
Put 3 cups sugar (680.4 g) and 1 cup clover honey (237 ml) in a heavy 4 qt.
Beat the mixture of egg whites and kosher salt within the mixing bowl attached to the electric mixer until firm peaks form.
Add 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar (113.4 g) to the mixing bowl and continue to beat the mixture for about 1 minute.
Continue to monitor the sugar and honey mixture that is cooking.
Pour the sugar and honey mixture slowly into the mixing bowl, combining everything with the electric mixer.
Add 1 tsp.
Use your prepared working surface to form the finished torrone candy.
Place the torrone candy on the work surface and knead it for 5 to 6 turns.
Lay the 2nd layer of edible wafer paper on top of the torrone candy, pressing down lightly.
Cut the torrone into individual pieces.

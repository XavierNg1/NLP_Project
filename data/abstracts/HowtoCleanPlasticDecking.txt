Although not all plastics are damaged by chlorine bleach, if you are not certain, then choose a cleaner that does not contain chlorine bleach.
If you choose to scrub the deck clean, choose a deck brush with natural or plastic bristles.
You may choose to use a pressure washer to spray the deck clean.
If you are cleaning to remove mold or mildew, there may be more to consider before you begin:

,
"Chlorine Bleach has been proven to kill bacteria, viruses and fungus but has not been proven effective in killing or removing molds on *porous surfaces such as composite decking and this fact is stated on the label directions of products like CloroxÂ® Bleach.

Now that you are ready to begin, clear off the deck and assemble your cleaning supplies.
Fill your bucket with the water and cleaning solution of your choice.

,
Wet the deck at one end by dipping the deck brush into the bucket, then sprinkling the water and cleaning solution onto the deck several times.

,
Scrub the dirty deck.
Continue to scrub and wet the deck as needed, and move on to new dirty areas until the bucket is mostly empty.

,
Empty the remaining solution onto the deck and go fill the bucket with clean rinse water.
Tip: If a water-hose is available, this could save many trips to just use the water-hose to rinse the deck.
If you decided to use a pressure washer, then the high pressure water stream is doing the scrubbing and rinsing in one step.
Once your deck is clean and dry, you may wish to seal any existing scratches.

Warm up the muscles that are going to be stretched.
Lay down on a solid surface such as the floor or a treatment table.
Have your partner take the limb through the full passive range of motion, mobilizing all joints that the targeted muscles cross.
Have your partner take you into a passive stretch, preferably targeting specific muscle groups.
Without moving from the stretched position, isometrically contract the muscle being stretched with about 20% to 50% of your strength for 8 to 15 seconds.
After 8 to 15 seconds of isometric contraction, relax the muscles and have your partner take the limb slowly through its range of motion a few times.
Repeat the stretch/contract/relax sequence as desired.

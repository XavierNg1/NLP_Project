Obtain some old candles.
Find an old saucepan or something similar that can get wax on it.
Break up the old wax and stick a few pieces in the saucepan over low heat.








,
Stir the candles until they have melted.








,
Prepare the container for the wax while you are waiting for the candles to melt.
Pour.
Take the little bit of wax that you left in the saucepan and make sure that it is completely melted.








,
Pour the extra wax into the dip to make the dip fill in.








,
Let this little bit of wax completely harden.








,
Remember depending on what type of container you used, either light the candle directly in the container or you can slip it right out of the container.








,
Keep in mind that if you are having a hard time getting the candle out of the container, stick the container in the freezer for about five to ten minutes.
Decorate your new candle with glitter, sand, flowers or any other idea you might have to make your candle pretty.

Finished.

Dress really outrageously.
The Bruno Walk is very poncy, oozing with confidence and perhaps a little stupid.
Adopt a very camp German accent.
Adopt some stereotypes.
Always insist your age is 19, even though you may be older.

,
Be obsessed with being famous, stardom and Hollywood.
Sing, Dance and Act really terribly, but actually believe that you are amazing and confront anyone who brands you a "talentless idiot", even if you are a really good singer, dancer or actor.

,
Don't take anything, except fame and your talent, seriously.
Actually believe that you are famous, and go to funny, extraordinary lengths to avoid the "waiting paparazzi".
Play loud, thumping Trance music wherever you go.
Just generally be completely outrageous!

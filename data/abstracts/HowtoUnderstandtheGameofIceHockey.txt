The goal to hockey is to bring the puck up the ice and score points by getting it into the net.
The hockey rink is a rectangle with rounded edges as you can see in the picture.
At the start of the game and after each whistle, a face-off takes place.
After one team gains possession of the puck, they pass and skate the puck up the ice to try to score.

Players cannot go 'off side' this means that they cannot pass the blue line of the oppositions side before the puck does.
Players also cannot 'ice' the puck this means they cannot shoot the puck down the length of the ice.
There are multiple ways to get a penalty.

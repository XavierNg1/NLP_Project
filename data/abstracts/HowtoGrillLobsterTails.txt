Thaw frozen lobster tails to room temperature.
Prepare a garlic butter basting sauce for the lobster tails.
Fill a large saucepan with water.
Lay the lobster tails on a cutting board with the bottoms facing up.
Oil the barbecue grate generously to prevent sticking.

Place the lobster tails on the hot grill with the flesh side down.
Turn the lobster tails over so the shell side faces down.
Serve lobster tails with melted butter and lemon wedges.

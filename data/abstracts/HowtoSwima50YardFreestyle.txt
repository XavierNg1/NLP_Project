Step up onto the starting block.
Select your entry point visually and mentally.
Leap off the starting block once the starting “beep” goes off.
Use a powerful dolphin kick off the starting blocks.
Swim freestyle once you break the surface after about 5 yards (4.6 m) of underwater dolphin kick.
Roll on to the side (so that this arm is facing down towards the bottom) that is going to pull first.
Take the arm facing the bottom out of streamline position and pull it straight back in a forceful motion.
Recover the arm that has just pulled over the water quickly in a bent but relaxed position.
Engage the arm that has not pulled in a slightly bent position about 6 – 8 inches (20.3 cm) below the surface.

,
Thrust arm into the water so that it is completely straight and is about 4 – 6 inches (15.2 cm) below the surface.
Pull the arm straight back forcefully.
Repeat (including both parts) until you are about two yards away from the wall.

,
Remember to keep your head steady and have stamina and momentum in your arms and kick.
With the final arm-pull into the wall, reach and start rolling into a flip leading with the arm and following through with the head.
Bring both feet over the water quickly and place them about 10 – 12 inches (30.5 cm) under the surface of the water and on the wall.
Push off from the wall.
Treat the last part of the race just like the first part, and the same rules apply.
Repeat until you touch the wall on a final stroke at the finish of your swim.
End in a sportsmanlike way.

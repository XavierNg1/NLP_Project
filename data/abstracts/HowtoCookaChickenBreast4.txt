Arrange the chicken breasts in the bottom of a large saucepan.
Sprinkle some salt and pepper on top of the chicken, then add the lemon slices, fresh thyme, and rosemary.
Cover the chicken with water.
Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, then let it simmer, covered, over low heat for about 10 to 15 minutes.
Take the chicken out of the saucepan and serve it.

This will not work with spiral notebooks- the best you can do with them is cut out two pieces- one for the back and one for the front and stick the two on.
Place the opened notebook on the T-shirt.
Mark the outline of the notebook with chalk, leaving a 2" (5 cm) border.
Cut along the outline of the t-shirt.
Place the t-shirt cover face down.
Apply tacky glue all over the front cover of the book.
Press the t-shirt fabric into the glue.
Flip the notebook and spread glue across the back cover.
Place the remaining t-shirt fabric over the back cover.
Trim the fabric around the book cover.

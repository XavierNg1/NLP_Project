If you are boarding a small, off-peak flight, try asking the ground crew before the flight for a quick peek into the cockpit.
Try to ask a member of the cabin crew or cockpit while on the ground.
When boarding the aircraft, have a look toward the cockpit.
If you once again miss the opportunity, wait until the flight has landed.
You're in!

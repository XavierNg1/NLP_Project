Practice storing information.
Develop a theory of mind.
Practice.
Incorporate observation into your daily life.
IE.
Next time Amy is mad, try giving her a compliment….
If she does….
If she didn’t take the compliment, well, you were wrong; maybe she reacts specifically to compliments from guys she likes, which means she probably doesn’t like you.
Practice Practice Practice Practice Practice.
Understand that humans are just like any other system in our universe.
If you can live life like this, truly observational and neutral, you will begin to gain your internal Locus of Control.
This is a lifestyle, live it.
From this day on, as you find your balance between overanalyzing and being oblivious, practice.

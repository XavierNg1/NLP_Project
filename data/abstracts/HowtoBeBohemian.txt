Create art.
Listen to the music, read the books, watch the movies, etc.
Challenge what you and others believe.
Become informed about other lifestyles or points of view.
Express yourself in some artistic way.
Question authority (within reason)- politicians, parents, school or work authority, and even the popular trend setters, they all tell you what to do in some way.
Live for the moment.
Stay comfortable.
Choose fabric with all of your senses.
Know that it's your body.
Study how your clothing moves before you go out.
Remember that when most people think of Bohemian style, bright colours and graphic prints come to mind.
Keep it simple.
Mould your clothing to your personality and mood.

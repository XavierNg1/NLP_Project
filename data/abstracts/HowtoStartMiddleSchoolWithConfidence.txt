Wake up at a reasonable time.
Eat a good healthy breakfast.
Hop in the shower.
If you are a girl, blow dry your hair and straighten it, or just make your hair look nice.
Get dressed.
Brush your teeth, and do all your essential stuff.
For girls.
Now make sure all of your stuff is in your backpack ready to go.
Talk to some of your friends on the phone before you leave.
Leave for school.

Recognize your need of Christ: He said, "I am the vine and you are the branches.
Repent and change your mind towards Jesus in faith.
Pray.
Read the Bible.
Give thanks and rejoice!,
God delights to satisfy his children in Jesus!,
Ask God to give you the strength to keep His commands.
Study Jesus' words in the four gospels.

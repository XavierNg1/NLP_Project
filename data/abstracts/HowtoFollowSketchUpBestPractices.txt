Save your work frequently.
When actively modeling, be sure that Layer 0 is active.
Draw one part at a time.
As soon as a part takes 3D shape, make it a component.
As soon as a component is created, move it to its own layer.
Finish the model before adding to the scene, like adding textures and the like.

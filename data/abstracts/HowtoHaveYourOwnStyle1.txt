Assess your wardrobe.
Pull your absolute favorite clothes out of the closet and line them up on your bed.
Look at each outfit you have chosen and ask yourself why you love it.
Decide if you wear clothes to impress others or to feel good while you are wearing them.
Are your favorite outfits appropriate for most of your daily activities?

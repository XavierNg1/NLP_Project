Start with exploration: You might go to a large evangelical meeting in a stadium or a small group Bible study.
Do not depend or rely on what others decide, say or do, if you would receive Jesus Christ.
Get a Bible and begin to read it.
Watch TV broadcasts of large or small Christian worship services and hear TV sermons or listen on the radio.

Prepare your vehicle: Make sure the car is fully Valeted.
Put your price slightly higher than what you expect—negotiate to get the deal that’s right for you.
Purchase a "hold until sold" advertisement.
Understand if your asking price is on the lower range you may park it at the nearest Walmart, or some shopping area where lot of people turn up.
Do your sales-pitch when they phone.
Do not let them test drive the car alone; they may not come back.
Seal the deal.

Be careful traveling to areas where MERS is prevalent.Countries that have had higher rates of MERS include Jordan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Yemen, Lebanon, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Iran.
Wash your hands regularly.
Refrain from touching your face.One of the fastest way to pick up a bug and catch a virus (such as MERS) is to touch your hands to your face — including your eyes, your nose, and/or your mouth — after it has been in contact with the bodily fluids of a sick person.

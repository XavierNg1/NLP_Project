Only buy fresh oysters if they are closed tight, or close immediately when touched.
Purchase an oyster knife: a thick, dull-pointed blade for shucking.
Rinse and scrub all the closed oysters under cold water.
Set up an ice bath by filling a large bowl with ice and water and nesting a smaller bowl inside of it.
Find the bottom of the oyster and place it on a small towel.
Using half of the towel, cover up all of the oyster but the hinge.
Poke the tip of your knife into the hinge, searching for a place you can easily pry the shell apart.
Twist and pry the knife to lift the shells apart, prying until they "pop.",
Turn the knife perpendicular to the oyster to pop it open even more.
Cut along the flat top shell to completely open the oyster up.
Dump the liquid and oyster in your cool bowl, toss the shell out, and repeat.

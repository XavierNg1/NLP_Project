Attain all 20 masks, plus the three character masks (Deku, Zora, Goron).
Defeat all 4 temples in Termina.
Wait until the final day arrives, when the clock tower opens.
After confronting the skull kid again, get out your ocarina and play The Oath To Order and the giants will hold up the moon to keep it from falling.

,
Now that you're on the moon, there are 5 kids; each wearing one of the 4 temple boss's remains.
After you've found all the kids and gave away all of your masks, go up to the child wearing Majora's Mask and he'll give you the Fierce Deity's mask to play "good guys against bad guys together".

,
Fight Majora's Mask with your new powerful mask!

Tie a hook on to the end of your line using a regular clinch knot, multiple lines are an option though bullheads usually don't travel in schools.
Put a split shot sinker on the line.
Put the bobber a few feet above the hook usually.
Bait the hook with something smelly!,
Cast out according to the season.
Good Luck!

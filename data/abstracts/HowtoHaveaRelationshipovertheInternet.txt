Determine why you want to be in an internet relationship.
Find an online community or service specific to your desires.
Avoid sites that may be catered to desires and needs that are different from yours.
Acquaint yourself with the rules of the online community in which you choose to seek romance.
Respect others' feelings as you would in real life.
Should you decide that you would like to take your relationship with your online paramour into the real world, be prepared for the possibility that he or she may not feel the same way.
If a meeting outside the online world is decided upon, follow all the same rules you would if you were going on a blind date.

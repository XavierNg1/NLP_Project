Painting is a good way to reduce stress, especially painting with fingers.
Role plays help your kid to expend energy.
Itâ€™s a bad idea to watch TV or play games before going bed, because this will make your kid overexcited and falling asleep will be hard.
The comfort of sleeping is very important too.

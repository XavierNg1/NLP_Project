If you're in the hall and some dude is threatening you or trying to get in a fight, AVOID it!,
First, keep a neutral face while he's threatening.
Say something creepy like, "Hurt me, and I'll skin you alive with a cheese grater.",
Now, there's a possibility you'll be walking around town at night and some hobo or whatever grabs you.

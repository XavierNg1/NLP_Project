Never talk back or disrespect your coach.
Obey your coach.
Develop good skills.
Think before you act.
Bring the problem up in an email or phone call.
Try hard to practice the skills the coach is teaching, so that the coach can't say you're slacking.

,
Always follow directions and listen intently when the coach is talking.
Work your hardest and best.
If the problem is serious, talk to your parents, and they can have a meeting with the coach and the principal.

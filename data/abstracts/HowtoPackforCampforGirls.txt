Make a list of clothing, toiletries, and other things you will need or ask a camp supervisor for a list of things you will need.
Make sure you have shirts, tanks, shorts, jeans, sneakers, boots, underwear, socks, sports bras, capri pants, a hat, bathing suits, and something of every variety of clothing.
Shop for the things you don't have, and bring the list with you so you know exactly what you need.
In the last few days before camp, check off everything on the list to ensure you have everything.
The day before camp, wash and dry everything you'll be taking to camp and pack it neatly.

Check out the machine you're going to operate.

Read the operator's manual of the machine you will operate.

Climb up on the machine you have chosen.
Crank the engine, allowing it to warm up for a few minutes before attempting to engage the transmission or operating any controls.
Check to make sure all attachments are clear of the ground, including the stabilizers, the front bucket, and the backhoe boom.
Release the parking brake, and shift the transmission into forward, then drive it slowly around while you get the hang of steering and braking the machine.
Raise and lower the front end loader bucket (if equipped) to get the feel of it.

Park the machine in an area suitable for practice digging with the backhoe.Set the throttle to rev the engine to about 850 Rotations Per Minute (not too fast until you get the hang of the controls).
Lower the stabilizers until they raise the rear of the tractor so the back wheels no longer touch the ground, then lower the front bucket to its limit, raising the front wheels also.
Unlock the back boom.
Push the left lever further outward after the boom is unlocked to lower the main boom, or nearest section of the backhoe boom.

Position the bucket over the spot you want to begin digging, then push the right control stick to the right to open the bucket for scooping, then lower the main boom to engage the soil.
Raise the boom with the left control arm by pulling it.
Swing the bucket to the side you're going to dump the load of dirt you scooped from the hole by pushing the left control lever in the direction you want the boom to swing.
Swing the bucket back to the starting position by pushing the left control stick the direction you want the boom to go, then repeat the process.

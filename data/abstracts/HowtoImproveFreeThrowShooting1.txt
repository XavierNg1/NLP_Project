Be confident.
Always use good form.
Get squared up.
Make a routine that puts you in a rhythm to shoot a free throw.
When you shoot the shot look at the front of the rim, and then you can either watch the flight of the ball in the air or not.

,
When you shoot, make sure your feet are not flat on the ground.
Make sure when you shoot that the ball only comes off your dominate hand, your other hand is just a guide.

,
After you shoot, make sure you follow through with your hand.

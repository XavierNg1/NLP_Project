Plan ahead when making the soup.
Fill a sink with ice, and add enough water to turn the ice into a slush.
Pour the soup pot into new, metal container and place it into the ice bath right after you take it off the stove.Metal loses heat a lot quicker compared to other materials, such as glass or plastic.
Stir the soup every 10 to 15 minutes.
Drain the excess water and add more ice when necessary.
Check the temperature often.
Choose a plastic, re-sealable, freezer-safe bag.
Label the bag.
Place the bag into a jar, and flip the top edges over the mouth of the jar.
Fill the bag with the soup.
Seal the bag.
Place the soup into the freezer.

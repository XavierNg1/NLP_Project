Use fresh eggs.
Choose a good pan.
Bring the pan up to medium heat.
Crack your egg into a separate bowl.Whenever using eggs, you should always crack them into a separate bowl before adding them to the dish or other ingredients.
Pour the egg into the preheated, oiled or buttered pan.
Season or garnish the egg while itâ€™s still cooking.
Lower the heat and cover the pan when the whites lose their translucence (for sunny-side up).This will likely take 2-3 minutes, though it may vary depending on your pan temperature.
Flip the egg if you want it over easy, medium, or hard (optional).
Remove from heat when ready to serve.

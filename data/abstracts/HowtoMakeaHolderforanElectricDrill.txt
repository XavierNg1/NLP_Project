Find a used plastic container used for washing machine detergent.
Mark a slanted line near the bottom of the handle and across to the handle's top but on the opposite side of the bottle (see image).
Carefully cut along the line.
Get rid of the cap––you can pop it off with a screwdriver, saw it off or wrench it out using a vise.
Discard the bottom of the container, or alternatively it can be used as a holder for other things.
To eliminate sharp edges, run the heat gun along all the cut surfaces until the plastic softens and rounds itself out.
Punch or drill a hole at the non-cap end of the bottle, which now finishes just after the end of the handle.
Drill a hole in the workbench where you consider it will be convenient to hang the drill holder and supplement the screw with a washer to avoid tearing.
Attach the drill holder.
Try it out.

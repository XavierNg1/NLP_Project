Collect your materials.
Once this step is complete put the shirt on and pull across one side of the shirt as if your doing up a bathrobe.
Grab your red ribbon and with many pins, pin down the ribbon mimicking the pattern that is on asuna's costume.
If you have a dress, cut out the front of the dress where desired to create asuna's half skirt leaving the front hanging so you can create the arrow front.
For your shield, use white fabric (all you need to do is draw the flattened shape of the shield on an A3 sized piece of paper).
Draw the top of the shields armour plate on to a separate piece of paper and pin to white material.
For asuna's socks, take one pair of your knee high socks and with your red ribbon sew it in a circle around the top of the sock.
To create the arm bands, take your second pair of socks and cut off the toe part of the sock only.
For the shoes - if possible you can purchase kids school ankle boots (flat ones) and spray paint them white and with the fabric paint paint on the design of asuna's shoes by eye.
Purchase a wig for Asuna's hair unless you already have hair similar to hers.
For the bit that hands of asuna's arms- to create this we laid out a flat piece of paper proceeded to draw the flattened version of it on the ground.

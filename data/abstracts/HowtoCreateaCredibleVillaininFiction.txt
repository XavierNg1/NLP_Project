Start by reading Create a Fictional Character from Scratch.
What's your story all about and how does a villain fit into the grand scheme of the story as whole?,
Choose the degree of evilness or just plain "ick" you want to place into your villain.
Create a single, traumatic incident for your villain.
Expand on this singular incident.
Choose a single thing that the character adores without greed or malice.
Combine the "turning point" and the "single thing" and bounce them back and forth in your mind.
Take into account the hero of the story.
Does the villain get eventually redeemed or does he stay a bad guy?,
Think of some fears.
Remember that a GOOD villain drives the conflict of the story.
A good villain is still human.
One last thing to remember is that the more evil and threatening a villain is, the more often their evil plans work.
Only kill off the villain if they deserved it.

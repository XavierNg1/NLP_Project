Take a moment and scan your memories for one of your life's truly memorable moments.
Write in a vertical column in the middle of the page all the words that come to mind when you think of this memory.
Now what you have are all these words in a list in a column right down the middle of the page.
Now that you've added all your "surround" words, read it out loud.
Find an audience and bask in your ability to express yourself.

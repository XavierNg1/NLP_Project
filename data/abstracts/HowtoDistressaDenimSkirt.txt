Get the skirt: You'll want it to be a little on the long side because you'll end up cutting a few inches off to make the bottom frayed.
Try the skirt on: Fold the hem up so it's as short as you want it to be.
Cut the hem: Using a ruler and a pair of scissors, cut the amount of inches off the hem that you measured out earlier.

,
Fray the hem: Pull all the little white threads out of the hem with your hands and with the metal file.
Using the scissors, cut a small hole up near the pocket.
On the horizontally opposite side of your skirt, near the hem, try to pierce a hole through the skirt.
Finished.

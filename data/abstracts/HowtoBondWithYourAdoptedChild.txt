Love the child.
Find activities that the child will be interested in that will benefit them intellectually and emotionally.
If you live in a culture that values privacy and personal space (e.g. modern western cultures), give them a personal space to spend time in, and respect that space as theirs.
If your child is of a different religion or nationality than you, respect it.
Ask questions, but don't pry.
Let the child have some control over the family choices.
Never put down or attack the biological parent's character.
Relax.
Know when to seek professional help.

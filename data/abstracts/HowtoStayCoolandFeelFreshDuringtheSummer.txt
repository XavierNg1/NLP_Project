Shower every day.
Moisturize right after you step out of the shower.
Make sure to clean your face regularly.
Style your hair so that it's off your neck and away from your face.
Brush your teeth.
Wear shorts, skirts, loose/flowing tops, tanks, flip-flops and sandals.
Be sure to drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, especially if you're going to be outside.
Choose refreshing, fresh fruit snacks such as watermelon, grapefruit, oranges and strawberries instead of normal snack food, like a bag of chips.
Open windows at night to let in the cool air and breezes, but keep windows closed and blinds drawn during hot, sunny days.

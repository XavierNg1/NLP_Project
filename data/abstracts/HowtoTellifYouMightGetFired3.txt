Monitor the quality of the relationship you have with your boss.If your relationship with your boss declines in quality and remains poor for a significant length of time, you should get excited about the possibility that you might soon have a new job.
Attempt to improve your relationship with your boss.
Look for strange behavior from your coworkers.If your coworkers were previously friendly and kind to you, but now avoid your gaze and duck out of conversations with you quickly, they might know something you don’t – that you need to brush up your resume.
Evaluate how appreciated you are.
Experience exclusion and isolation.If you’re being taken off important projects or meetings, or if you were never included in these meetings and projects to begin with, you might wonder why.
Ask for a greater level of inclusion.

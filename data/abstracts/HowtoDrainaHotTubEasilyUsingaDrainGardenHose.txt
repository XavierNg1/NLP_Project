Connect the hose to the water bib (that's the faucet on the side of your house).
Once you've got flow into the tub, turn off the water at the hose bibb.
Bend a kink into the hose a couple feet below the connection to the hose bibb.
Disconnect the hose from the faucet.
Once you've got the end you're holding (still kinked) below the level of the hot tub, and you're in your pre-selected location for where you want the water to go, let the end of the hose un-kink.
Remove the water.

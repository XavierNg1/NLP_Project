Find a blanket.
Cut the blanket in half widthwise.
Pin ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) wide double-fold bias tape along the raw edge.
Sew the bias tape down.
Fold the bias-taped edge down by 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) to make the collar.
Place a short, loose-fitting jacket on top of your folded blanket.
Mark where the sleeves join the body of your jacket.
Remove the jacket, and draw a vertical line between the top and bottom sewing pins.
Cut the sleeve holes and remove the pins.
Take the other blanket half, and cut it in half widthwise.
Fold each half lengthwise, so that the finished edge of the blanket becomes the cuff.
Shorten the sleeves, if needed.
Check the width of the sleeves against the arm holes you cut.
Sew the sleeves, with the right sides facing in, using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.
Turn the sleeves right-side-out, and pin them to the sleeve holes.
Sew the sleeves on, using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.
Wear the coat.

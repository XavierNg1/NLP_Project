Start by setting a goal and consider what criteria you wish to set yourself.
Consider the cuisines you currently like and look for the vegetarian recipes available, then expand international cuisines and explore different recipes.
Explore meat-protein replacements and include them in your diet.
Stock up a Vegetarian pantry with a few "cheat" products.
Make bulk meals if you don't have time to cook often.
Plan your meals a week ahead so you can shop accordingly.
Whenever you buy your meals, if you cannot find or choose a good vegetarian restaurant (such as if you have guests who enjoy meat meals, or they just aren't local to you), do a little research in advance to see if the menu offers something good for vegetarians.
Consider vegetarian meals that are known to be enjoyed by non vegetarians as well, should you share a house with non vegetarians.
Focus on different methods of cooking, as well as colours, fragrance, flavours, flavour boosters such as spices, herbs and sauces as well as textures to make the meal always seem satisfying and less "dull".

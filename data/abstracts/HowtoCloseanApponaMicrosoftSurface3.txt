Open the task manager in the Windows-default app known as Desktop, that most of your computing will be done in.
Look for all your open apps on the task manager.
Choose your method of execution of the closing of this app.
Make sure that no other background processes have opened that the Task manager didn't close.
Close the Task manager at least after you've closed the app itself.

Cut one of the shoe laces in half and place it as shown in the photo.
Determine what size you want the end loop to be.
Using the basic stitch, sew the neck of the loop.
Braid the three cords tightly.

At the end, fold one of the cords to make an end loop.
Sew the neck of the loop with a basic stitch, going back and forth many times, until the width of all these stitches is 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm).
Use this braided cordage to secure your wallet, pocket watch or keys to your belt.

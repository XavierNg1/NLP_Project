You can throw in 1-4 chew sticks/toys.
If you are looking for a more nutritious, environmentally friendly way of keeping your Hamsters teeth shaved down, you can use pesticide free fruit tree branches.

If you still have trouble keeping their teeth down take a visit to your veterinarian.
Hamsters will chew on most things that are given to them, so finding the right tools should not be too hard.

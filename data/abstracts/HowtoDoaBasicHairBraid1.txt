Start with brushed, tangle-free hair.
Divide your hair into three even sections at the nape of your neck.
Cross the right section over the middle section.
Cross the left section over the new middle section.
Continue the braid, alternating right and left sides.
Tie your braid off with a hair tie.
Consider adding a ribbon or pretty hairclip to the end of your braid.

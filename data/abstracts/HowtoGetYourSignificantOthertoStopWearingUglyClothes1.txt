Plan a shopping date for the two of you.
Buy them clothes as “just because” presents.
Compliment your partner when they're wearing nice clothes.It’s a sign of positive reinforcement that is much more effective in encouraging him or her with wearing more of the things you like to see them in.
Suggest streamlining both of you guys’ wardrobe.

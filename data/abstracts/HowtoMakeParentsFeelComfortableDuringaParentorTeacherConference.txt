Schedule meetings with parents with a fairly wide window.
Be on time for any parent appointments you have.
Do not bring anything to the meeting that would distract you from the communication at hand.
Do bring to the meeting anything relevant to the student's involvement in your class.
Take notes during the meeting.
When the parents arrive, welcome them warmly.
Make sure you know the child's name and are saying it correctly.
Introduce yourself to the parent.
Begin your spiel with something positive.
When you get around to delivering bad news, be truthful.
If you are delivering bad news about grades, show the parent what type of work you are requiring of their child.
If you plan to allow makeup work, show it to the parent at that time.
Be sure and allow the parents time to ask questions or make comments.
Don't use acronyms that parents don't understand.
When you are finished with the meeting, be sure and summarize any steps you and the parent have agreed to take.
Thank the parent for taking the time to meet with you.
In a few weeks, follow up on the conference with an email, note in the student's agenda, letter in the mail, or phone call.

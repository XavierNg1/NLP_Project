Practice in front of a friend or family member.
Read a book while you wait.
Get into character.
See the cup half full.
Just do it.
Don't worry about forgetting your lines.
Don't look at the judges as hostile towards you.
Pretend they aren't even watching.
Don't be afraid that you'll end up freezing on stage.
Stay positive.

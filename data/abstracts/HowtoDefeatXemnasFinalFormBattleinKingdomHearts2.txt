These are the abilities you must equip: Action: All except Guard, Counterguard, Explosion, Trinity Limit and Horizontal Slash.
Use Ethers, Curaga, Reflega and Thundaga to shortcut.
Before you can go to the Final Form battle, you must defeat 5-7 other battles.
Don't equip any items, except Ethers and Mega-Ethers, because Riku has the Cure Potion ability which heals you, but also drops his MP.
Now you can go to the battle Xemnas!

,
Try always to save Ethers.
After you beat all battles in the final battle, except the Final Form battle read this!

,
Xemnas says "Anger and Hate are Supreme" and then use reaction command, but watch out, if you equipped Riku auto Limit!

,
So use reversal and try use action abilities and Riku's Eternal Session to attack him!

,
After you beat at least 3 health bars he use lasers so avoid by using shortcut reflega to.
After you beat at least 4 health bars, he stops Sora and you must hurry!,
Attack.
Then defeat Xemnas by using a VERY long berserk combo or using Thundaga and you complete this game!

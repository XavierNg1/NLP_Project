Consider the benefits of a book journal.
Choose a medium.There are two main routes you can go with a book journal: You can write in a physical journal, or you can take your writing online with a blog.
Buy a durable book.If you opt for the physical option, you shouldn't rely on a cheap coil-bound book.
Set up a blog.
Create a Goodreads account.
List the book's essential information.Every journal entry you make should have obvious info included for the sake of posterity.
Write in facts you might forget.The memory is fickle.
Copy memorable quotes into your entry.
Comment on writing techniques in the book you're reading.Some book journals will rely exclusively on what a book is about, but there's just as much value in talking about the way an author explores his topic.
Note your current time and place with each book entry.A book journal doesn't just catalogue what you're reading.
Relate the book to what's going on in your life.For the sake of understanding the experience of reading a book, it may be a good idea to write in a few notes about what is actually happening in your life at the time of reading.
Reflect on whether the book has changed you.Books are a source of fun and relaxation, but they also help us grow as people.
Make a periodical reading goal.
Write your book entry as you read.Some book journal keepers prefer to wait until the end of a book to make their entry.
Finish your entry as soon as you're done reading.
Keep your book somewhere safe.
Take care of your book journal.If you're keeping track of your reading with a physical journal, you should take extra care to protect it from natural wear and tear.

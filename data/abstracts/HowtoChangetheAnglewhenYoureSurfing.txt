Start off by building your sandcastle.
Start trimming the surfboard (to speed it up, push your hips forward and place more weight on the front leg, to slow it down, move your hips to the back and place more weight on the back leg).
To change the angle of the surfboard you will need to link your upper and lower body and connect with your surfboard.
While trimming the surfboard, shift your weight to the back leg, with your arms out rotate the upper body to your forehand or frontside and at the same time shove your front hip across in the same direction, bringing the surfboard with your body and changing the angle it is facing.
Remember that the angle of the surfboard should change approximately between 10 and 45 degrees.
Start off in waist deep water and surf white water (broken) waves.
Shift your weight.
Transfer your weight onto the front leg after attempting the change of angle.

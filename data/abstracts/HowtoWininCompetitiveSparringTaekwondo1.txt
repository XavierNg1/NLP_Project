At the very beginning
The moment you hear of a competition you may wish to enter, this is when your training should begin.
Build up your Stamina
The fight in the ring will last three rounds of 1-2 minutes, depending on what competition you enter.
Stretch
Constant stretching will allow you to kick higher and faster.
Equipment
Most sparring matches require the use of the hogu (body protector), a helmet, arm and shin guards, gloves and groin guards for both genders.
Practice your Kicks
During the tournament, most of the kicks you will be doing are turning kicks, due to competition rules which disallow pushing kicks.
Practice your Punches
While punching is allowed, it is a commonly known fact that judges rarely count them, and often do not count many kicks as well.
Practice your Blocking
Blocking off an opponent's attack will deprive them of points.
Practice your Evading
Another way of defending yourself is to evade the kick.
Practice your Counterattacks
These kicks are the most likely to score points because many fighters let their blocks fall when they start attacking.
Check your Fighting Stance
The stance you adopt on fighting in the ring is very important.
Weight Categories
All fighters must be in their own weight categories in order to make the fight fairer.
The Day Before the Match
On the day before your match, just practice lightly and do not over strain yourself.

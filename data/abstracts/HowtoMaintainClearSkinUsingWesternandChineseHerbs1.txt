Purchase some dried calendula (marigold) flowers (preferably organic).
For a gentle floral water/toner, steep 3-4 flowers per cup of hot water for about 3~5 minutes until the water is a nice golden color.
For an astringent floral water/toner, steep 5-6 flowers per cup of organic apple cider vinegar, and keep in a dark, cool place for about a week.

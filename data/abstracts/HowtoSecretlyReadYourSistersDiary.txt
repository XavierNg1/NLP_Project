Think about why you want to read her diary.
Know where her diary is.
Don't read it yet.
If her diary has keys, look for them.
Grab it when she isn't around.
Take it somewhere like the bathroom.
Read it at night.
Don't put it where it was.
If she was away or didn't know it was missing, put it back where it was.
Remember- which goes into being a good liar- what you would do if she /really/ asked you and you really didn't take it.
Act normal.

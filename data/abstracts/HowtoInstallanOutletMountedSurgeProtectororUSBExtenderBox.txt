Unbox the USB outlet/surge protector item once you've transported it home.
Find and take off the original switch-plate.
Make sure that the original outlet box set has been tightened down, if it's been quite awhile since it's last adjustment.
Figure out the direction of the way the outlets are formed.
Match the prongs of the surge protector outlet up with the original outlet, as you push these prongs into the outlet themselves.
Stop pushing the box into the outlet until it stops or becomes unmovable and tight.
Place the screw into the center hole of the box between the three prong outlet and the USB ports, and tighten down the screw with a screwdriver.
Sample (or plug in) an electrically-powered item to ensure all outlets work.

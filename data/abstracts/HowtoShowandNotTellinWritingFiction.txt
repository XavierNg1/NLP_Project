Decide on your topic.
Jot down some defining characteristics of the topic.
Write a first, simple draft to build upon.
Read over your draft and find "telling" words like looks, very, seems, old, and forms of "to be".
Rewrite the draft, using your imagination (and probably a thesaurus) to expand the descriptions.
Note that "showing" will usually be much longer than "telling".
Continue to revise until you are completely satisfied with the scene you have shown.

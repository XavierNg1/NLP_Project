Begin with Maxwell's Equations in vacuum.
Take the curl of both sides of Faraday's Law.
Substitute the Ampere-Maxwell Law.
Rewrite the wave equation in one dimension.
Twice differentiate the solution with respect to x{\displaystyle x} and t{\displaystyle t}.
Substitute these equations back into the wave equation.
Arrive at the answer.

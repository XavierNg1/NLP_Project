Consider the water requirements of the bamboo.
Consider the sunlight needs of your bamboo.
Consider the space requirements of your bamboo.
Prepare the soil.
Dig the hole for the bamboo to go in.

If the plant had any culms pointing out in an undesirable direction, it is fine to straighten it up to vertical at this point.
Again, being careful not to break any new shoots, press down firmly on the plant to insure good contact in the bottom of the hole.
Make a berm to help direct water to stay around the plant.
Fill the berm with mulch.
Water the bamboo again to help the different soil layers merge together and connect with the roots.

Write the month in the first column e.g.
When you receive money that month, write down the Date e.g.
If you spend money write down the item (or place) e.g.
About ten rows down from where you have written your first items, in the column INCOME (D) write this: =SUM(D4:D14) (if you started your income in row 4 and are writing this in 15.
Write the same sum, with a different set of column numbers e.g.
In the same row as your previous two sums, in the BALANCE column, write =SUM(D15-F15) (or other numbers).
At the end of the month look at your balance.
If you have a positive number highlight the cell in green.
If you have a negative number highlight in red.
Congratulations, you have a budget spreadsheet.

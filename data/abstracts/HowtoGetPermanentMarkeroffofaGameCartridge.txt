THIS DOES NOT WORK FOR GETTING MARKER OFF OF THE LABELS!!!,
Get some materials.
If the marker is near the label, take some caution in how much cleaner you use.
Wet a paper towel or grab a wipe and begin scrubbing.
Wipe any solution off the cartridge.
Keep cleaning until the marker gets very faint.

,
Once the marker gets extremely faint, to the point where you need to really look for it to see it, you are almost done.

,
At this point, you can begin pushing hard enough to fray the paper towel.
Continue this process until the marker is gone.

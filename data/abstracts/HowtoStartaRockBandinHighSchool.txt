Be able to play an instrument or sing.
Name your band.
Put up notices; this is a great way of getting the message around that you want to start a band.
Don't just have your friends or girlfriend/boyfriend in the band for the reason that you like them.
Going back to the friends thing- only have people in the band if they can do something.
Once you have some replies to your notice (hopefully you'll have sorted out a place for the auditioners to meet you), go along and meet them!,
Once you've all the people you want, usually a bassist, a drummer, at least one lead guitarist, and a vocalist, you'll need to have a good grasp on writing songs and a basic level of knowledge on how a song is structured.
Go to the writing desk!,
Realize that writing songs is hard at first so, don't worry about making things rhyme to start with.
Once you've got your paper which is basically black from all your writing, pick out favorite bits, and maybe change parts so they rhyme.
Take all the other bits, make them rhyme and sing it through.
Now you've written a few songs, you'll need to put a tune to it.
Look at venues.
Advertise!,
Get people's opinions on the band, If some people have divided opinions, like "Did you like (insert name here)'s band in assembly yesterday?",
Have fun.

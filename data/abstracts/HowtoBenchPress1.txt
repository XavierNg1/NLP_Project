Begin by lying flat on the bench, with your body in a natural and relaxed position.
Put your arms straight out to either side of you, and then bend your elbows, bringing your hands up to touch the bar.
Begin with just the bar weight to warm up before heavy lifting.
Rack the bar and add weight.
Be sure to have a spotter to help you whenever you lift a heavy weight.
Lift the bar up, slowly bring it down to just above your sternum, and explode upward for one rep. Pay attention to your form as you add more weight.
Drink plenty of water and take at least two minute breaks between each set.
Rest according to how you feel between sets.

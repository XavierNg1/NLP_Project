If no studs (wall installation) or strapping or joists (ceiling) are present, the toggle method can be used.
While holding the wings against the threaded rod, determine the diameter of a hole that would be required to push the toggle nut through.
Drill into the ceiling only deep enough to penetrate the wallboard.

,
Squeeze the toggle nut wings against the threaded rod, and press the toggle nut into the hole completely.
Twist the swag until the flange or base is firmly pressed against the ceiling.

,
Repeat for as many swags as needed.

Refrigerate the carcass as soon as possible.
Skin the snake.
Rinse the meat, and cut it into pieces with a sharp knife or poultry shears.
Dip the segments in a bit of egg white (milk would also do) before dredging them in a pepper and sweet cornmeal mix (or cornbread mix with some extra black pepper).
Heat about 3/4" (2cm) of canola, vegetable, or peanut oil in a heavy frying pan until quite hot.
Drain and cool.
Serve your fried snake bits warm, and provide napkins - this is finger food.
Eat the snake meat.

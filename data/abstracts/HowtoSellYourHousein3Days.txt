Hire a good, successful Realtor.
Meet with your Realtor for a walk-through of the house and to receive presentation tips for your showing.
Clean up the outside of your house--your front yard especially.
Avoid the dark, dreary atmosphere of dark wall colors.
Remove all the furniture possible in the house.
Erase most of the evidence of inhabitants from your home for the viewing, especially pets.

,
Clean, clean, clean!,
Hide all trashcans--closets are a good place to temporarily store the smelly, obstructive objects.

Set up your house for viewing.

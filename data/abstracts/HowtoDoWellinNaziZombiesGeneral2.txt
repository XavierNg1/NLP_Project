Weapons are the most important part of Nazi Zombies as the quality of your weapons determines how far you get into the game.
Good guns to buy are the MP40, AK74U, and the MP5K.

If you have the money, buy the Bowie Knife as this is a very powerful, it can take out the strongest zombies in 2 or 3 swipes (be careful).

Finally is the mystery box, this is one of the biggest factors of surviving Nazi Zombies.
Pack-a-punch transforms your weapon into something truly devastating.

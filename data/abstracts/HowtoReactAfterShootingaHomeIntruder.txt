Ensure that the area is clear from other intruders or threats.
Contact emergency services which is usually 911 and ask for the police.
Only when you're sure you are alone and safe unload the weapon and put the gun away in a secure place.
If requested to do so by the police, avoid the areas of the house that may contain evidence to allow the police to get a clear picture of what happened and how the intruder got into your house.
You may be arrested as a precaution.

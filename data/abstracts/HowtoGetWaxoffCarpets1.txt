Plug your iron in somewhere within reach of the waxy patch.
Using a blunt knife, scrape off as much excess wax as possible.
Lay some brown paper or a paper towel over the remaining wax and iron over the top.
Reposition the paper and keep ironing over a fresh part of the piece of paper until most of the wax has been absorbed.

Look outside for a flash of lightning.
Once you see the lightning, begin counting right away.
Stop counting once you hear a roll of thunder.
Divide the number of seconds you counted between the lightning and thunder by five.

Once you have found your quotient, that is how many miles or kilometers away lightning is.

Hold the needle with the stitches in your left hand, and hold the needle without stitches in your right hand.
Insert the needle without stitches under the front of the first loop (the one closest to the needle point), and push it through so the right needle sits behind the left needle.








,
Make sure the working yarn, the yarn attached to your yarn ball, lies in the back of your needles.








,
Grab the working yarn attached to the yarn ball (not your tail yarn), and wrap it around the right needle counterclockwise, so that it sits in between the two needles.
Look in between your two needles.
Poke the right needle through the left hole to the front of the left needle.
Now that you've got a new stitch, pull off the old stitch.
Repeat the knit stitch until you've knitted every stitch that was on the first needle, and they'll all been transferred to the second needle.








,
Switch the needles.
Knit every row and keep switching needles.

Make your cereal or oatmeal more nutritious.
Have at least 1/2 cup of fresh fruit with your breakfast.
Toss some vegetables into your pan of eggs.
Drink calcium fortified juices, like orange juice.
Limit the pastries.
Another option is to bake your favorite breakfast pastries at a healthier version on your own, for example: Whole-grain, sugar-free cakes/muffins/granola bars; baked oatmeal with fruit and nuts (a great alternative to regular cooked oatmeal, because you can make ahead and refrigerate it); savory muffins with veggies (carrot, zucchinis, tomatoes... Whatever you like!)

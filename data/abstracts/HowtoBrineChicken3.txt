Consider butterflying the meat for crispier skin and moister breast meat.
Preheat your oven to 500°F with a rack in the middle of the oven.
Add any aromatics you want to the chicken.
Place the chicken in the oven, basting every 10-12 minutes.
Cook the chicken for 45 minutes, or until a meat thermometer in the breast reads 150°F.
Let the chicken stand before cutting into it.

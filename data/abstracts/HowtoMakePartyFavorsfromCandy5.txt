Purchase orange tulle (net), orange jellybeans or candies, orange or brown rubber bands and brown pipe cleaners (chenille sticks).
Draw a large circle on a piece of thin card.
Place the template onto the tulle.
Fill the first tulle circle with candy.
Use the rubber band to hold the tulle top in place.
Wind the brown pipe cleaner around the tulle top.
Repeat until all of the pumpkins needed have been made.

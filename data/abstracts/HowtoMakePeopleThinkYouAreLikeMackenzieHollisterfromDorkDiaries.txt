Act sweet and kind (to most people).
Wear nice clothing.
You should own at leat one purse.
Look after your body.
Mackenzie loves to gossip.
Get a cell phone, or call friends with a landline.
Merge with the popular people, but after a while, once you are the most popular, leave them to themselves.
Say things like 'OMG' and 'hon', so people think you are posh and pretty.

Have fun!

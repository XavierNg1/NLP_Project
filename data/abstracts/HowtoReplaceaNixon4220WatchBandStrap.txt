Prepare your supplies.
Find the screw on either end of each lug (top and bottom).
Turn the screwdriver with steady but firm pressure, being careful not to slip and scratch the case, or strip the screws.
Set aside both pairs of screws after removing them from both lugs.

,
Take care to remember which side of the lug has the set pin.
Take a screwdriver and gently turn the lug screw until the set pin drops into place.

,
Take a matching small screw and finish attaching the band at the other side of the lug.

,
Repeat this process for the other half of the replacement watch band and you are done!

Grab a plain white printer paper, a ruler, a tape measure, a black marker, and invisible tape.
Using the ruler and the marker, starting from either top corner of the page, begin to measure and mark points in 2.0mm segments straight down the same side of the page until you have at least 10 of them.
Now go ahead and draw your horizontal lines by appropriately placing your ruler and connecting corresponding points on each side.
Place and stick the page vertically on a wall in a way that the middle part of the back and white area is approximately at your eye level and centered between your eyes; you also need to make sure that the sides of your paper are parallel to the sides of the wall and the room is well lit with a good light source.

Put everything down, grab the ruler, stand in the position you were when you placed the page on the wall, cover your left eye, and slowly start walking straight back while keeping your right eye on the center of the page.
Grab the tape measure and measure the metric distance straight from the bottom of the wall to where the front of your feet were.
Now comes the fun calculation part which is simply 138/d and will give you the number that you need to put in the denominator of the standard 20/xx model of visual acuity for your right eye.
Repeat the last 3 steps this time covering the right eye to measure the acuity of your left eye.
Now that you have calculated your visual acuity, look at the logic behind it.

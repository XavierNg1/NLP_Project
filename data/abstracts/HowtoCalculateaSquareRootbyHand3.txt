Separate your number's digits into pairs.
Find the largest integer n whose square is lesser than or equal to the leftmost number (or pair).
Subtract the number you just calculated from the leftmost pair.
Drop down the next pair.
Fill in the blank spaces in the right quadrant.
Subtract the number you just calculated from the current number on the left.
Repeat step 4.
Repeat step 5 and 6.
To continue to calculate digits, drop a pair of zeros on the left, and repeat steps 4, 5 and 6.
Consider the number you are calculating the square root of as the area S of a square.
Specify letter variables for each digit of your answer.
Specify letter variables for each "chunk" of your starting number.
Understand this method's connection to long division.
Find the biggest number whose square is less than or equal to Sa.
Visualize the square whose area you are beginning to solve.
Subtract A² from Sa.
Look for N1 = 2×10A×B + B², also written as N1 = (2×10A + B) × B.
Solve.
Subtract the area (2×10A + B) × B from the total area.
To calculate the next digit C, repeat the process.

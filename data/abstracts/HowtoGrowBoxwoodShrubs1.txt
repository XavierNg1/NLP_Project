Plant boxwoods in full sun.
Do not plant them where they will be exposed to harsh winds.
Make sure the soil drains well and has a pH of 6.5 to 7.0.Soil that drains too slowly will keep the roots too wet and could cause the boxwood to develop root rot.
Take a pH reading of your soil.
Adjust your soilâ€™s pH if necessary.

Start promoting your book before contacting bookstores to show that you're serious, then continue promoting it and directing potential customers to the stores that are willing to stock your book.
Ask the store to order your book from their distributors.
If they aren't interested in stocking physical copies - or even if they are, in ADDITION to the print copies - ask about opportunities to promote the eBook version.
Identify the bookstore contact person.
Be professional and respectful.
Follow up.
Be as professional at the end as at the beginning.
Respect staff time.
Continue marketing.

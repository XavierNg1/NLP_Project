Do your research!!!,
Go to the dealer with CASH if you can.
Before you even test drive the car, set a price-point in your head of how high you want to go.
Don't seem too interested in the car.
Remember, don't get emotionally attached to the car, and be willing to walk away if the price gets too high.

,
Whether you know anything about cars or not, take a look at the engine.
When test driving the car, and while looking at it, find any problems at all.
Start your dealing magic!,
The dealer will probably say he wants more for that, bring your price up just a bit.
Stay strong on your offer.
Just remember, folks, stay strong.

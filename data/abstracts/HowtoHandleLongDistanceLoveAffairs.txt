Weigh the costs and benefits of distance.
The more you communicate, the more relation gets strong.
Establish rules for the relationship.
Establish times to visit, and ideally a plan to be together in the near future, if this is what you want.
The golden rule, expect less.
Arguments usually end up with a fight.And Best of luckÂ :D

Buy in bulk:


When shopping for natural and organic foods, buying in bulk can save you a lot of time and money.
Attend farmers' markets:


Farmers' markets offer locally grown produce and other natural foods at a lower price, because you're buying directly from the distributor, in this case the farmer.
Join a co-op:


These member-owned organizations offer discounts to participants.
Purchase a community-supported agriculture (CSA) share:


Farmers who grow organic products work with distributors or as a distributor and assemble produce boxes with seasonal produce for pickup or delivery to consumers.
Buy in-season:


Organic produce that is in season often costs less money, because there is so much more product.
Purchase store brands:


Many large-chain grocery stores have store brands that offer natural and organic products.
Look for the natural food aisle at your local grocery store:


Many stores nationwide have entire sections with natural and organic products.

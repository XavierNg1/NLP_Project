Slice your potatoes to your desired thickness.
Add 3 tablespoons of salt to a large bowl of water and soak your sliced potatoes in the salt water for half an hour.
Choose an oil you'd like to fry with.
Heat your oil in a deep fryer or a large frying pan until it reaches about 350째 to 375째 F (177째 to 190째 C).
Cook your potatoes in small batches, removing when they start to turn golden brown.
Once removed, put the chips on a plate with a paper towel over it to absorb the oil.
Finished.

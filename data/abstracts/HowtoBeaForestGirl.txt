Check out your local clothing or thrift store for cheap, earthy finds, go for a walk in the forest with a basket, or hit up etsy and pick out your essentials: Moss, feathers, collected bones from the forest, anything with animal or bug motifs, or plant motifs and felt and craft items from walmart, all on a budget.
Bring your collected items home and get to work.
Be creative!,
Be sure to get to know your local species and their habitats.
Choose ethical and organic products from nature.
This is a subculture and a movement meant to reflect ease, casualness and be a reflection of the natural and woodsy.

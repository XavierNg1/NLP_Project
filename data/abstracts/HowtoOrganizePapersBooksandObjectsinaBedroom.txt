Do a clean out and place all the papers, folders, books and other materials you don't want anymore, or don't really need, into piles.
Leave what you do want in its pile.
Get all the paper that you can draw, write, paint with, or use in any other way.
Buy a whole bunch of binders, preferably enough to take up the whole space of one of the shelves in your room.
Do the same thing with folders.
Sort the books.
Ensure that the shelves look very organized.
Use boxes, containers, and hooks to store and tidy.
Have just a few minimal essentials on your side table, like an alarm clock or a phone if you have one.
Add a few items without cluttering the look.

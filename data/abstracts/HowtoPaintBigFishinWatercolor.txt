Practice doing fish first.
Mount your 11 x 14" watercolor paper onto a double weight foam core board using masking tape on all edges to keep the piece from buckling as you work wet.
Set up a palette with 1/4 inch of the primary and secondary colors around the edges of a white, plastic dinner plate.
Prepare your paints by pulling with a wet brush blue, green and yellow into the center of the plate and mixing with enough water to create three vibrant puddles of paint.

Paint the background first by wetting your paper around the fish with clear water.
Wait and watch until the surface of the paper goes from shiny to slightly dull.
Paint the fish as you did the background, by wetting the fish shapes and dropping in colors.

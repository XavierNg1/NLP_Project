Decide which villager you want to build a strong friendship with.
Talk to the villager or villagers that you chose often.
Send them nice letters often that include thoughtful gifts.
Avoid pushing them, hitting them with any of your tools, such as your net or axe, pushing them into pitfall seeds, or talking to them so much that they get annoyed.
Say yes to any errands that they ask you to do for them.
Try your best to make them stay if they tell you that they're leaving in a conversation.
Keep repeating these steps for awhile.

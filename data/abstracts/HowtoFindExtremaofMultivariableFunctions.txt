Consider the function below.
Calculate the gradient of f{\displaystyle f} and set each component to 0.
Solve for x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} to obtain the critical points.
Use the Hessian matrix to determine the characteristics of the critical points.
Calculate second partial derivatives of f{\displaystyle f} and substitute the results into H{\displaystyle H}.
Check the determinant of H{\displaystyle H}.
Check the trace of H{\displaystyle H}.
Check the boundaries if you are finding extrema in a closed domain.
Check the corners if you are finding global extrema in a closed domain.

First apply some foundation to your face.
Buy some Spirit Gum from a Halloween store, it might sell in normal convenient stores.
Press some raisins on the spirit gum and hold it there.
After the gum dries, apply some powder to your face that matches your foundation.
To make your hair, simply blowdry it lightly on low heat then use a curler or a round brush and wrap bunches of hair on the curling tool.
Now if you have a proper outfit for a witch, that's fine.
The nails.
The wand.

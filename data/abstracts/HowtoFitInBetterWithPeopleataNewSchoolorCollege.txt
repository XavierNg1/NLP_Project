Know that a new place brings new challenges.
Don't try to just "fit in"; "adapt" instead.
Make acquaintances: Try making new friends.
Know your values: Making new friends may be hard, but stand by your values even more.
Trust your inner conscience: Believe in your gut feelings.
Observe your new friends: Observing your new friends will not only help you to know their likes or dislikes but a lot more about them.
Don't be reserved: Talk.
Always be the fabulous "YOU": Don't let people's opinions about you make you lose your path.
Be in touch with your BFFs: Just because you are new to a school or college does not mean you can make new friends and forget the others.
Get yourself involved in new things and keep yourself busy.
Always remember everyone has hard days sometime in their life.

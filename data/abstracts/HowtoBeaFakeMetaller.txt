Look at your friend's music collection, ask them (because you won't know yourself) which is the heaviest and then buy several T-shirts of those bands.
Join Facebook and Bebo, every time your metal friend suggests a metal/rock/punk band or group, accept the suggestion even though you've never heard of half of them.
Think that wearing the most outrageous T-shirts and getting noticed is what it is all about.
Make sure you have a local pub.
If you are in your local and your real metal friends come to visit you for a few pints, don't draw your usual amount of attention to yourself in case you have to prove yourself metal, you won't be able to and will look more of a fool to your metal friends who think you are a fool anyway.
Wear your clothes like a uniform.
DO NOT LEARN HOW TO HEADBANG!,
Take an interest (but don't actually start to study these things and know about their symbolism, just the look is needed) in the symbols you associate with being a metaller, but in reality, they aren't really.
Try not to care, you do care but at every opportunity say that you don't.
Wear lots of jewelry.
Decorate your house like a teenager would decorate his/her bedroom.
Think that being a biker is the same as being a metaller, but it's not!,
Make sure to neglect to tell anyone that does think you are a metaller that you are in fact a dance head, raver, mix master supreme, disco freak.

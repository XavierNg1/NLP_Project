Enter each number in the data set into its own cell.

,
Select a range of cells equal to the number of modes you wish to find in the dataset.
Enter the MODE.MULT function into the formula bar.
Use control+shift+enter to display the result as an array otherwise the result will output the same as MODE.SNGL.
Unlike MODE.SNGL, MODE.MULT displays multiple modes.
If no number in the data set appears more often than any other, the MODE.MULT function will display the error result #N/A.

The MODE.MULT function is available only in Microsoft Excel 2010.

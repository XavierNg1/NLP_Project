Study for the test.
If you're asked to buy your own Scantron sheets, buy them a few days before the test.
The night before the test, prepare your materials.
Before the test starts, write down the information that your teacher requires you to put downÂ such as your name, the date, and/or the class number on the sheet.
Answer the questions on the test by bubbling in the corresponding letter on the sheet entirely.
When you're done with the test, look over your answers if there's still time before handing it in.

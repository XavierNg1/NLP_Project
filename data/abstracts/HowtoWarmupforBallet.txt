Warm up every muscle in your legs.
Start off with going through all five positions.
Do this after a Port de bras, which means "carriage of the arms".
Try to go as far as you can, and make sure your head faces your belly-button.
Put your arm to the side, part your feet to second position, and repeat.

,
Repeat these for all positions, except when you come up from the port de bras on fifth position, go on relevé, which is on the ball of your foot, what people call, "on your tippy toes".

,
Now move on to stretching your leg.
Finish with plié relevés!,
These are the basics of warming up.

Show two or more singers the harmony of the three most basic chords: "1,3,5" chords (which are just the key of C or key of F or key of G) which have no sharps, no flats, etc.
Demonstrate chords to the singers and help them to hear how the different note combinations (chords) sound when working together.
Harmonize by singing "to the melody" but in a slightly lower or higher pitch to create a chord with voices.
Add a 7th for a fourth voice in harmony and/or the 1st (or root) note, up one octave (for unison).

,
Learn the basic 1,3,5,7 major chord notes (C7, F7, G7 -- see "Tips" below), as a group, and then you can help singers harmonize by their consistently carrying one of the chord notes; after they learn to hear them in the chord (and so they hear harmony) among voices.

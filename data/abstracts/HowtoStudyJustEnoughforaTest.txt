Have a short relaxation period before beginning to study for that grueling test.
Gather up the necessary materials needed to study for that one particular test.
Study just the 'important' stuff.
Every once in a awhile, not often, take 10-15 minute breaks, so your brain can absorb all this new information.
Try not to procrastinate when studying for a test.
Study for about an hour and then quiz yourself on that information you went over in that past hour.

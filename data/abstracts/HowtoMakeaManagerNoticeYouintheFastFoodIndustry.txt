Don't just stand there quietly.
Do your job.
Ask questions.
Be conscientious.
Be punctual.
Be a team player.
Accept advice as readily as giving advice.
Help others perform their tasks.
Learn how to do all the jobs.
Be flexible.
Limit talk about work in casual conversation if you can avoid it.
Take pride in your appearance.
Listen.

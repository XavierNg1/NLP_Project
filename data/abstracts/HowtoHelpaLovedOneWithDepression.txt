Talk to them.
If you can get rid of the cause, do it!,
Depression is a very serious mental illness, and is slowly becoming more popular due to jealousy, judgement, pressure, and stress.
They're suffering inside.
Be prepared.
If your child is depressed because they are getting bullied, take them out of school.
Don't give up!,
If you have more than one child, don't keep spoiling one but not the other.
Be aware of how your children are with one another.
Make them a priority!

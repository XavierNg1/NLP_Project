Fifteen minutes a day will go a long way towards a really clean house!,
Everyone has 'hotspots': places where paper and clutter seems to just pile up.
Look around the living room: tidy up the 'hotspots', fluff the pillows, put away or recycle the magazines and newspapers.
Since we all have to eat, the next area to tackle should be the kitchen.
Next, the oven/stove top.
Next on the list is the refrigerator.
With the counters dry and shiny, how much of what was on them really needs to live there?,
If you have a few extra minutes, wipe down the front of the appliances too.
Sweep and mop the kitchen floor.
If cold season is near, one of the easiest way to prevent them is to wipe off doorknobs with a 10% bleach solution.
The next step is the bathroom.
Go back to the living and dining room.
One of the last steps is to sweep and mop bare floors and vacuum all carpeted ones.

Last step is Laundry!

Finished.

Use the 12-bar blues chord progression as the backing of any blues song.
Alternate a big downstroke and a quick upstroke when strumming for a "shuffle" feel.
Play an open E, the I chord, for four measures.
Play open A (the IV chord) for two measures, return to then E for two measures.
Play B-A-E-B, each for one measure to end the progression.
Repeat ad nauseum.
Substitute 7 chords for a bluesy feel.

Sketch out the toy box design on paper.
Purchase the necessary materials and hardware from a home improvement store.
Lay out the pieces you need to cut on the MDF or plywood using a carpenter square and pencil.

,
Cut the MDF or plywood down to size using a circular saw.
Begin assembly by putting glue along the front and back edges of the bottom piece.

,
Clamp each piece with 2, 24-inch (70 cm) bar clamps to hold the pieces in place while you screw them together.

,
Apply glue to each side and the bottom of the 2 end pieces.

,
Slide these into place using the clamps to hold them while screwing the front, back and bottom to the ends.

,
Wipe all off the glue that has squeezed out from the joints with a soft cloth.

,
Make sure you sink all of the screw heads below the surface of the panels.
Round off, or ease, all sharp exposed corners while sanding gently.
Paint the exterior and interior of the box, as well as the lid and bottom with the color of paint you chose.
Attach the top to the toy chest using a 30-inch (76.2 cm) piano hinge centered on the lid's back edge.
Connect casters on swivels at each corner to make the toy chest easy to move when it's loaded.

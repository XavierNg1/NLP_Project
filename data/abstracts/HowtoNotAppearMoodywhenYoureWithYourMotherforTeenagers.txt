Never look angry: The first thing mothers notice about you is your facial expression.
Keep your voice steady: Yes, sometimes mothers say the most tactless and stupid things which make you realize how ignorant they are.
Don't resort to violent physical behavior This means don't kick walls, don't bang your head on the table, don't slam doors, don't chuck objects hardly on the ground, and do NOT hurt your brothers or sisters.
Do not whine or grumble: Right away your mum will assume you are tired - and tiredness is associated with moodiness.
Do not behave embarrassed when you and her are in public: As I said before, mothers are sometimes ignorant.
Escape when necessary: Your anger, irritation, impatience and frustration is building up in a sealed bottle, (not literally) and it's about to explode under the extreme pressure.

Situate both your computer and your keyboard so that they are centered and you are facing them directly when using them.
Make sure that the top of the computer's monitor is at eye level to avoid tilting your head forward or back, as this will stress your neck and shoulder muscles when sitting at it.
Ensure that the monitor is placed at arm's length from your eyes when you are sitting.
Avoid window glare when positioning your monitor screen, along with the headaches, eyestrain, and discomfort that glare often causes, by placing it at an angle to the window and tilting it accordingly.
Position your keyboard at the level of your elbows so that your hands and wrists are straight.
Opt for a swivel arm if your work situation requires that you interact with others on a regular basis.

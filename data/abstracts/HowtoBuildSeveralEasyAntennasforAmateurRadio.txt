Emphasis on the Antenna!,
Planning an antenna project can lead to many different thoughts and you should always consider the following.
Use materials that match easily.
What Works with What Current.
Start by choosing your place, and space for your antenna.
Select the wire you want to use.
Many tuned circuits of today's time can actually go down to several layers of skin with just one touch.
Make your antenna by the tried and true formulas.
Here's several other feed lines you may consider to use.
Screen your VHF and MHF bands.
Maximum output!,
Formulate then make!,
Raising or lowering the antenna can help with SWR, but also one more thing to keep in mind, It's a good idea to raise the antenna at least 1/4th wavelength above ground.
Stretch out the legs of the antenna as much as possible, and pull them as high in the air as possible.
Making a new design !,
Do not use the SAME FORMULA FOR THE CAGE DIPOLE.
Measure carefully, although not critical at this point.
Assembling your antenna, and this where the fun comes into play.
Make it "Count".

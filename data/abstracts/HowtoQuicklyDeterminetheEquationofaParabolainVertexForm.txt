Select the parabola that you want to use.
Remember the vertex form of a quadratic equation.
Note the coordinates of the vertex.
Replace h and k with the appropriate coordinates.
Find out if a is positive or negative.
Find the next point from the vertex on the parabola that has coordinates with two integers (it doesn't matter whether it is to the left or the right).
Find the value of a.
Convert the equation to standard form if necessary.
Remember to use the equation x=a(yâˆ’h)2+k{\displaystyle x=a(y-h)^{2}+k} since a parabola that opens sideways uses a different equation than a parabola that opens upwards or downwards.

Set up your loom so that the rows are in the shape of a "v".

,
Take a colored band and take it from the bottom peg and stretch it up to the beg right above it.
Color Banding: Continue doing the same thing all the way up the loom.

,
Center Banding: Take a neutral color and, skipping the first set of pegs, place it on the loom so it looks like an upside down triangle.

,
Make sure the arrow is pointing towards you when you begin hooking.
Continue Hooking.
Once you reached the end gently hook the band on both pegs and transfer the bands on the last middle peg.

,
Add the end loop.
Add the extension.
Add the C or S clip.
Take your hook out and you're done!

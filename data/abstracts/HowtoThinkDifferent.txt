Study another industry.
Learn about another religion.Religions are the way that humans organize and understand their relationships not only with the supernatural or divine but with each other.
Take a class.Learning a new topic will not only teach you a new set of facts and figures, it will teach you a new way of looking at and making sense of aspects of your everyday life or of the society or natural world you live in.
Read a novel in an unfamiliar genre.Reading is one of the great mental stimulators in our society, but it’s easy to get into a rut.
Write a poem.While most problem-solving leans heavily on our brain’s logical centers, poetry neatly bridges our more rational left-brain though processes and our more creative right-brain processes.
Draw a picture.Drawing a picture is even more right-brained, and can help break your logical left-brain’s hold on a problem the same way a poem can.
Turn it upside down.Turning something upside-down, whether physically by flipping a piece of paper around or metaphorically by re-imagining it can help you see patterns that wouldn’t otherwise be apparent.
Work backwards.Just like turning a thing upside down, working backwards breaks the brain’s normal conception of causality.
Ask a child for advice.
Invite randomness.If you’ve ever seen video of Jackson Pollock painting, you have seen a masterful painter consciously inviting randomness into his work.
Take a shower.There’s some kind of weird psychic link between showering and creativity.

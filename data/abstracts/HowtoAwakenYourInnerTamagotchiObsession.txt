First, you must acquire a Tamagotchi.
Once acquired, let the madness begin.
When it is around the child stage, you can start the insane obsession.
Sew or glue a little pouch for the teeny tiny Tamagotchi.
Take your Tamagotchi wherever you go.
Remember to always clean up its on-screen messes, and to heal it when it is sick.
In the summer, you can make little rock-houses for your Tamagotchi.
Always bring the Tamagotchi with you.
When you get your Tamagotchi, the package will have a little plastic mould cradling the Tamagotchi.
Either the above step, or you can take a large lump of crayola clay, stick a colored marker inside it, mix it up, (make sure it matches your Tama) and keep adding more marker until it is dark enough.

,
Bring your Tamagotchi into the shower.
Style it.
Always keep extra batteries on hand!,
Even if your Tamagotchi dies, you will still have a new beginning!,
Have fun.

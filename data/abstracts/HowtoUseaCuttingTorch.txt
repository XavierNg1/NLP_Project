Understand the cutting process.
Get the proper tools for the job.
Set up your work in a safe environment.
Place the stock you are going to cut on supports at a comfortable working height.
Mark your cuts with a soapstone marker, allowing for grinding if a precise fit is required.
Hook up the gauges to the appropriate tanks.
Make sure the acetylene regulator is turned off by backing the “tee” handle out a few turns, then turn the gas valve on top of the tank on.
Turn the oxygen regulator pressure off or down and then adjust the oxygen pressure.
Put your gloves and goggles on before lighting the torch.
Light the torch.
Adjust the acetylene valve until you have a yellow flame about 10 inches (25.4 cm) long.
Turn the forward oxygen valve on slowly.
Open the oxygen valve more to increase the flame size until the length of the inner flame is just over the thickness of the steel you are intending to cut.
Bring the tip of the inner flame to the surface of the steel you are going to cut.
Push the cutting valve handle down slowly to release the oxygen jet, which ignites the molten steel.
Begin moving the torch tip slowly along the line of your cut when the jet is cutting through the steel.
Continue cutting until you have parted the metal or finished the cut.
Cool the workpiece with plenty of water.
Chip the slag from the cut.

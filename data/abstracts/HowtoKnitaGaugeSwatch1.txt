Knit a gauge swatch.
Measure the gauge swatch with a ruler.
If you cast on a different number of stitches than the number recommended for your pattern gauge, you will need to count your stitches.
Know that if the number of stitches or rows per inch does not match what the pattern specifies, you will probably need to experiment with different needle sizes.

Remember that appearance is not everything, but ALL ATTRACTION IS PHYSICAL ON SOME LEVEL!,
Find an excuse to talk to him- even if its going out of your way and puts you at risk of looking a little foolish- truth is guys are going to acknowledge your genuine effort and find it cute.
Grab his Attention & make it effortless.
Keep it up and build excuses to talk to him and get his attention- if after two encounters- you're not picking up vibes that he's interested- surrender, because this should be quick and seamless.

Cut the flowers off once the petals are starting to fall off, a process known as "deadheading.",
Cut away dead branches, growth, and leaves in the fall after blooming is over.
Prune your shrub to about half of its normal size in early winter.
Cut at an angle when pruning, just above an outside facing bud or branch.
Remember that roses tend to grow perpendicularly to where you prune, adjusting accordingly.
Know that it is almost impossible to over-prune a shrub.
Note if you have once-bloom roses, which must be pruned only after the flowers bloom.

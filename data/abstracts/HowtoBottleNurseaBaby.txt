Despite prevalent attitudes today, there's no shame in bottle-nursing.
Hold your baby in the same positions you would if you were nursing him/her.
Take your time and get comfortable with pillows or a Boppy, just as you would if you were nursing.
Be sure to always hold the bottle at the right angle - every bottle system is different, so follow the instructions that come with the bottles.

Don't rush things.
A good latch is just as important for bottle-feeding as it is for breastfeeding.
Each baby is unique and has his/her own suckling technique.
Gaze into your baby's eyes, talk to him/her, and sing to him/her.
Always offer formula at near-body temperature.
DO NOT BOTTLE-PROP.
When you bottle-feed in public, try the same things that breastfeeding mothers do: Find a quiet place, get comfortable, and even cover your shoulder and the baby with a blanket so they can have a nice, cozy, non-distracting environment to eat in.

If you feel discouraged, remind yourself why you are doing this: To recreate the nursing experience for both you and your baby.

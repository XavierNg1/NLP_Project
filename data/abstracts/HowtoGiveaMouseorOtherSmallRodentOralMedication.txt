Have the medicine ready.
See if your pet likes the medicine.
Try to squeeze the medicine out in small increments, so it doesn't ooze everywhere before Squeaky eats it.
If your rodent doesn't want to take the medication as is, try hiding it in a treat.
If he's still not volunteering, make things easy on yourself and capitalize on the rodent's natural fastidiousness.
Use a clean washcloth.
If the medicine is particularly unappetizing and your pal's not falling for tricks, you'll need to get more insistent.
Scruff your rodent.
To scruff:


With your thumb and forefinger, aim for behind the neck and just before the shoulders, and not quite halfway around his middle.
If none of the aforementioned methods work, stop.

Spawn as a sniper.
Find a good sniping spot.
Place an auto turret behind you to defend your back.
Choose your targets!,
Try to avoid aiming for the heads of moving units.
Use your pistol primarily if you are planning (or have to) go in to close-combat.
Remember that the auto turrets are good for defending key locations, not for doing damage.

,
Get headshots on units that are standing still, or sitting in a slow-moving vehicle.

Once you kill enough enemy units, you have the option of getting a new upgraded sniper rifle.

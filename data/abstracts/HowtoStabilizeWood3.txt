Use the Pentacryl method if you have a fresh piece of wood that is in the process of drying.
Don’t place your wood cross section in a heated place to dry until you are ready to heat it.
Purchase Pentacryl, a wood stabilizer.
Get a soaking pool ready for your wood piece.
Place wooden slats or “stickers” at the bottom of the pool to keep the wood off the bottom.

,
Pour the Pentacryl over the wood cookie.
Cover the wood with plastic to prevent the top from drying out as it cures.
Allow the fresh wood to soak up the Pentacryl.
Move the wood cookie to a drying location once all the Pentacryl is absorbed.
Dry for eight weeks.

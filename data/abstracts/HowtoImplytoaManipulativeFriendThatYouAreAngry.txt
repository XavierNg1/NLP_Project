Don't appear too random and maintain your dignity: Coming up to someone and saying, "I want to break up with you" won't cut it.
You must act differently if something has triggered this: For example, maybe this girl has been using you, and yesterday, she partnered up with a bully and went against you.
Don't talk to them in your classes or in the halls: If they ask for help, say you don't know, and they should get the message.
When they asks why, state your reasons: If they've been doing this for a long time, it is okay to show your anger.
Be prepared for them to argue: But go on stating your points.
Keep yourself from feeling guilty: You did nothing wrong and you know it.
Don't put restrictions on your other friends: Chances are, you and this 'friend' have mutual friends.
The 'friend' will beg for second chances: Unfortunately, manipulative people don't change.

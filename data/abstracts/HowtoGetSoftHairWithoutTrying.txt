Brush your hair to get out any knots or tangles.
Get into the shower.
Make sure to soak your hair.
Use a quarter sized amount (or more depending on hair length) of shampoo and distribute it evenly throughout your hair making sure not to rub it in too hard with your fingers.
Rinse.
Put the same amount of conditioner on the ends of your hair, as your hair produces natural oils.
Take a comb and gently comb the conditioner evenly throughout your hair.
Rinse once more until it is all out and there is no excess conditioner still there.
Now before you go ahead and do this, point your shower head away from you as you will want to turn the temperature of your water to cold.
Brush your hair.
Try to refrain from blow drying your hair.
Finished.

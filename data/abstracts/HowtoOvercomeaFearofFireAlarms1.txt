Determine the root of your fear.
Identify your negative and irrational thoughts.
Challenge your negative thoughts.Alone and with help from others, call yourself out when you make an irrational association.
Replace negative thoughts with realistic thoughts immediately.Just challenging your negative associations and thoughts is not enough.
Treat your fear as just another thought.
Practice relaxation and coping skills.Before you try exposure therapy, you will want to practice a set of relaxation skills or coping mechanisms to help you work through the anxiety caused by continued exposure to the fire alarm.
Confront your fear gradually.In exposure therapy, individuals attempt to desensitize themselves to the fear of fire alarms through incremental exposure.
Forge positive associations over time.As you become more familiar with the fire alarm and more relaxed around the sound, you will naturally build new associations for your body and mind.

Be polite to every customer.
Always arrange your items neatly.
Always ensure that every item on display is in fact, up for sale.
Avoid displaying more than two of the same item.
Always try to trade the items from your inventory first (rather than those on display).
Open your store for no more than two hours or so at a stretch.

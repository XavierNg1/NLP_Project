Understand what skin tone is.
Examine your veins.The skin on your wrist, elbows, and temples is very thin and has blood vessels close to the surface.
Give yourself the “white paper test.”The skin on your face often has reddish tones that might lead you to believe you’re cool-toned, but the red might be coming from hormones, if you’re a woman, or sun exposure.
Give yourself the “jewelry test.”Again, you don’t want to compare colors against your face tones, so don’t use earrings for the jewelry test.
Consider how your skin responds to sun exposure.
Determine your season.Though in the previous section, you determined whether you were cool or warm-toned, there are two further subdivisions within these two categories.
Know which colors work for all skin tones.
Wear clothes that match your skin tone.Not all of your clothes have to match your skin tone perfectly, because then you’d be wearing the same handful of colors over and over again.
Wear jewelry that matches your skin tone.Remember the jewelry test you did to determine whether you were cool or warm-toned?,
Wear makeup that works well with your skin tone.You should always wear foundation and concealer that matches your skin tone as perfectly as possible.
Adjust your hair color to bring out your complexion.This is a drastic, longer-lasting change that just changing your clothes, jewelry, or makeup, so think long and hard about it before you dye your hair.

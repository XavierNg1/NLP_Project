Make sure that your executive team arrives six to eight hours before the fashion show begins.
Have a meeting with your team to discuss different tasks that should be completed throughout the day and before the actual show begins.

,
Create a breakdown of the day specifying every hour and every task.
Have your models, volunteers, and technician crew (DJ and lighting) arrive an hour after your executive team comes in, which is thirty minutes after your meeting.
Have the models do a run-through.
While model practice is going on, have your volunteers and some executive team members help with decorations and others help set up backstage for designers and for hair and make up artists.
Have your hair and make up artists arrive thirty minutes to an hour after the models begin their practice on the stage.
After model practice, split the models up into two groups.
Have your designers arrive a little before models start getting their hair and makeup done.
Give your volunteers a break for working three hours.
Once volunteers come back from their break, let your executive team get dressed and ready for the show and allow your models to have a break to eat if they havenâ€™t done so already.

,
Get everyone in place.
Models should be dressed for their scenes and scenes one through five should be lined up and ready to walk once the show begins.
Let the lights go dim or off for the audience to know the show will begin.
Cue the music and the opening act.
After the opening act, scene one should walk out.
Depending on how many scenes your team has for the fashion show, consider splitting up the scenes at an even number and put an intermission in the middle.
Everyone backstage should be getting ready for the ending scenes of the show.
Once everyone backstage is ready, let the next scene after intermission begin.

,
Know that a well-organized fashion show should take no longer than an hour and a half to showcase.

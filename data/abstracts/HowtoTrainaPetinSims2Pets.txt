To teach your pet a command, have a selected Sim click on the pet, then click "Teach Command".
If you don't have time to teach your pet tricks, but still want them to learn, call an obedience trainer.
To teach your pet a behavior, they must do something such as sniffing Sims, sleeping in the pet bed, sleeping in the Sim bed, or peeing on the floor.

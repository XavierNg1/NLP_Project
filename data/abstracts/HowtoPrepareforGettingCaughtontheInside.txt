Before starting your bodyboarding adventure, be comfortable in the ocean.
Know the layout of your break.
Have a sturdy leash and attach it to your board with a plug and on the handle, you want a double attachment.
Choose a bodyboard appropriate to your weight and so you can be competitive in catching waves.
In dealing with incoming waves, progressively use the different techniques according to the wave strength: 1) in small waves, stay on the board and punch through the wave, 2) in bigger waves do an Eskimo roll and continue paddling without skipping a beat, 3) and with the biggest waves, turn your board belly up, kick hard with your legs, hold your bodyboard firmly, and head out and down to the bottom.

You will get caught on the inside of a big wave when the wave of the day comes in, when you get dropped in on, or from mistake in judgement.
When paddling for the horizon or directly into the wave, anticipate where the power of the wave will be and avoid that area.
Smaller waves and shallow water will usually not be life threatening.
Big waves break in deep water, so with most big waves, be concerned with drowning and collisions with other bodyboarders, surfboards and surfers.
Bailout as a last resort if going over-the-falls will be truly horrendous.
Avoid shoulder injury on the side that the leash is attached to your wrist.
Always do a set, of perhaps 15 repetitions, of lying leg crossovers.

Wash the diapers.
Lay the diapers out flat, with the stains facing up.
Alternatively, line-dry the diapers or drape them over a drying rack.
Choose a sunny day to achieve the best, most potent results.
Spray lemon juice onto the worst stains.
Bring the cloth diapers in after a few hours pass.
Repeat the process for stubborn stains that do not come out after the first round of bleaching.
Throw the diapers into the dryer for a few minutes.

Find yourself a pencil, a sketchpad or paper to draw on, and a subject to draw.
Hold out your pencil at arms' length, close one eye, and line up your pencil to your subject.
Keep your thumb in place on the length of the pencil.
Repeat the previous steps, but instead of measuring in the reference object every time, draw in everything around the original object measured.
Remember to relax and always look back at your subject!

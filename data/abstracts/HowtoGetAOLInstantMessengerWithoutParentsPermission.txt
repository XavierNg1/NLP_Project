Sign up for an account at the AIM website.
Use AIM Express instead of downloading the messenger software.
Delete your Internet history after you use AIM, and even AIM Express, so no one can see which websites you've visited.
Use AIM at a friend's house if you don't have a computer or can't use the computer for chatting.
Download AIM and change the settings so the program won't pop up automatically when you turn on the computer.

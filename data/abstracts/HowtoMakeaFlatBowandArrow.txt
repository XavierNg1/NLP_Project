Get some wood.
Check to make sure your wood is about one to one and a half inches wide and five eights of an inch thick.
Begin shaping the wood.
Understand that you must leave the bark on the back of the bow (the side that faces away from the archer) If removed, it may crack and break.
Making the bowstring.
Make the string three inches longer than intended to be so you can make a loop for stringing and un-stringing.

,
Start taking a fourth string that is two inches longer and twist it around it.

,
Begin making loops for stringing and un-stringing.
Take a long string of the same material and wrap it tightly around the string only where you are going to nock your arrow.

,
Let your bow dry before stringing so that it does not warp and lose its springiness.
Understand there is a faster way to make it dry.
Make arrows out of cheap dowel rods.
Know that the longer the bow the more power it can have and the easier it is to make, Depending on your height, you may want to make it as tall as you are.

Remove the caliper from the pad bracket if necessary.
Remove the pads and inspect them for wear.
Apply anti-squeal paste to the backing of the new brake pads, but do not install them yet.
Inspect the brake rotors: Always resurface the rotors with a crosshatch pattern if within spec, if the rotors are too thin to resurface replace them.
Inspect the brake hoses.
Remove brake rotors if turning or replacing them.
Get the rotors resurfaced ("turned") at a machine shop or auto parts store that turns rotors.
Install the new or resurfaced ("turned") rotors in reverse order of how they came off.

Notice that the new caliper will come with two brass washers, plus rubber grommets for the slide pins, pad retaining clips (if applicable), possibly new slide pins, and maybe that hollow bolt mentioned above.
Reattach the brake hose with a new brass or copper washer installed on both sides of the hose fitting, that the hollow "banjo" bolt goes through.
Clean the caliper slide pins if you haven't done so yet.
Compress the caliper piston, or in some cases screw them in if necessary.
Clean up any brake fluid that may come out of the reservoir at this point.
Put the new pads in the caliper or bracket.
Place the caliper back into the pad bracket, and bolt it in.

Determine what kind of music you need.
Consider music that is licensed under Creative Commons: There are many sources of CC content and most are pretty proud of the fact that they are part part of the Creative Commons movement.
Figure out where to find it: There are a lot of good sources for "production music" I'll reference a few later.
Know your rights.
Get worry free music.

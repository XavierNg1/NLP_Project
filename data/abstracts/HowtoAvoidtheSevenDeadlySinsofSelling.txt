Avoid talking your way out of the sale.
Avoid stumbling due to systemless selling.
Avoid gorging your way to a loss of credibility.
Avoid sexy but substanceless marketing.
Avoid losing sales because of the blame game.
Avoid putting your own needs before those of your prospect.
Avoid blindly following the masses, because of envy, instead of leading through customer-centric differentiation.

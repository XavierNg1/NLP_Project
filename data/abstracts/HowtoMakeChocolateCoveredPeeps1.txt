Unwrap the peeps from their packaging.
Melt the melting chocolate in a double boiler.

,
Dip the peeps into the chocolate.
Remove from the bowl and place on wax paper or parchment paper to set.
If adding sprinkle decorations, this needs to be done quickly at the time of bringing the peep out of the dip and just before laying the peep down to set.
If giving as a gift, arrange in a chocolate/candy gift box lined with parchment or wax paper, then place Easter colored tissue paper over the top.
If displaying, these can be added to all sorts of candy Easter displays, such as on plates, in bowls or on top of baked items.
If you'd like to keep decorating the peep, small pieces of candy can be added to the facial area of the peep to restore its eyes, nose and mouth features.

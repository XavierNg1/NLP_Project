Get familiar with terminology.
Keep in mind that everyone has a unique vocal timbre, or "color" of voice.
Once you have figured out your vocal timbre, now's the time to figure out your range.
Remember however, range is not everything and certainly doesn't say whether you can be a belter or not.
Become familiar with mixed voice.
Now the fun part - belting!,
Remember to breathe!,
Keep your jaw relaxed.
Remember that not all voices are equipped to belt effectively, and this is OK.
The most important thing to remember though is that if it hurts, STOP!

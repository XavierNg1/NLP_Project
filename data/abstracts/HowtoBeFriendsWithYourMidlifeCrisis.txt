Unfortunately you may be the only person who feels this way.
If you approach your mid forties or early fifties feeling content and without any ' should haves' and ' could haves' - great.
Take yourself seriously!,
Listen and accept whatever goes through your mind as information.
Feel your emotions and don't talk them away with ' I have no reason to feel unhappy/ restless/ anxious/etc.
Trust.
Change your attitude to the word' crisis'.
If it feels right, it most likely is right!,
Realize that there is a difference between becoming a selfish prat and fulfilling long harbored dreams and ambitions.

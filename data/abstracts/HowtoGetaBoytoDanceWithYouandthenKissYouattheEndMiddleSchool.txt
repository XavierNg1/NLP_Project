Make sure that your crush/the boy is going to the dance.
Look fabulous.
Once you get to the dance, look around until you spot your crush/a boy that you want to dance with.
Once a slow song comes on, seek the boy out!,
On the next slow song, look for him again.
On the next slow song, if the boy has a girlfriend, find another one to dance with.
Make sure to dance with him on the last song of the night, because it makes a good impression.
After the last dance is over, tell him that you had a nice time.
Once you get to your house, it's now or never!,
If he kisses you, congratulations.
Now, just hope for the best!,
Always try to be near him.

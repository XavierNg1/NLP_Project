Decide what type of low pitch, flat roof you want to install.
Determine what materials you will need to complete the job.
Remove the old roofing.
Replace any sections of the plywood decking that have been damaged by water or "dry-rot" (fungus) before you install a new roof.
Install wooden or synthetic can't strips.
Lay down the felt (paper) base sheet (if required for your process).
Add flashing to the roof.
If BUR is legal as some cities do not allow BUR, especially on residences, then "build up roofing" layers held in place by mopping molten, hot tar or asphalt -- coal tar is a known carcinogen.Installing asphalt BUR roofing typically uses LP gas as heat, contributing to air pollution, and toxic, green-house gases are released during installation).Cut a 12 inch (30.48 cm) starter strip to mop it down as the first row of the starting edge, often the lowest edge and working up to the higher elevated part of the roof.
To apply the first coat of hot asphalt over the nailed felt base, spread the hot asphalt with a large mop -- as the felt is rolled out into the mopped hot "cement", one row at a time.
Continue laying each row with a 24 inch (61 cm) overlap of the one before it, using full width felt, over the entire roof for the first complete layer.
Hot mop each felt as the next layer is rolled on.
Optional: Finish it by spreading crushed granite aggregate (called ballast/gravel) after you've installed all of the desired layers.

Plan the right number of stitches for the pattern of the piece you intend to make.
Cut out a 18 - 24 inch strand of wire.
Do not wind the wire on your pinkie or bend it around your forefinger.
Tie a slip knot.
Holding the wire with one hand and the hook with the other stick the crochet hook through the slipknot and grab the wire with your hook.
Continue making the desired number of chain stitches and checking the diameter of each loop using the wide part of the crochet hook to keep an uniform shape.
Turn your work and slip stitch a row.
Repeat until you finish the slip stitch row.
Keep practicing until you can also crochet more intricate stitches like single crochet, Half double crochet, Double crochet, Treble crochet, etc.

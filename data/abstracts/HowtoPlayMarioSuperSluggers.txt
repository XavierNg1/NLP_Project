Star Swings/Pitches: Each captain (Mario, Peach, DK, Bowser, Wario, and Yoshi) along with all the secondary captains (Luigi, Daisy, Diddy Kong, Bowser Jr. Waluigi, and Birdo) have their own special hits and pitches called Star Abilities.
Nice Plays are especially tough outs that are usually made with a diving or leaping catch, or by a buddy move.
Buddy Moves can save home runs and help your fielders make lightning fast throws.

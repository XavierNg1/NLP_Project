Do not just "kick" the ball unless it is in a dangerous position in front of your goal.
Always maintain your position.
When defending close to your goal, the player closest to the ball should attack the ball.
On the defensive side of the field, always move the ball toward the touch lines and away from the middle of the field.
Good ball handlers pass the ball before they get into trouble not after they are in trouble.
Make no small strikes on the ball.
Take your shot.
Don't limit yourself to shots taken only near the goal line.
Always be aware of protecting possession of the ball.
When on offense always "support" your teammate with the ball.
Don't be afraid to get aggressive.
Win, lose or tie.
Always wear comfortable outfits and footwear.

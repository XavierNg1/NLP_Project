Call your boyfriend and ask him to meet you somewhere calm and quiet.
Move right into the breakup after you've greeted each other.
Use direct, unambiguous language.
Avoid getting angry, pointing fingers, or assigning blame.
Stand by your decision, no matter what he says.
Leave once you've said all you need to say.

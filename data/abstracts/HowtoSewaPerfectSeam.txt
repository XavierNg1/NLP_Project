The first choice, in machine sewing a seam, is to align the edge of the fabric on the seam guide plate or the presser foot.
When sewing a difficult seam create a line on the fabric and sew on the line instead of aligning the the fabric on the seam guide plate or the presser foot.
To sew a seam directly on a line, make a line with either a ball point pen or wax pencil.
Use chalk and a straight edge to make a line but do not sew on the line.
Before starting, you must:


Have excellent lighting: overhead lighting, the light from the sewing machine and a table lamp.
Apply this to sewing curves.

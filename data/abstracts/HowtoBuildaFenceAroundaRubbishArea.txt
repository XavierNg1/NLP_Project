Clear a fence line around the rubbish.
Measure the perimeter of the pile and calculate the length so you can estimate how much material you will need for the fence.
Buy the fencing material and suitable posts, as well as a gate (if you don't build your own), and fasteners.
Start at one side of the location where you plan to put your gate.
Set the next post in line with the first, keeping an equal distance from the edge of the rubbish pile, and about 8 feet from the starting point.
Continue setting posts equally spaced around the pile until you are near your starting point.
Roll out the fence wire (if using) around the perimeter you have created with the posts, then attach one end to the first gate post.
Nail rail boards (typically treated 2X4s) if you are using wood privacy fencing, one at the top of the post, one in the middle, and one about a foot from the ground between your posts.
Add material to block the view of the rubbish pile if you need to.
Hang your gate and install a latch on it, and your job is complete.

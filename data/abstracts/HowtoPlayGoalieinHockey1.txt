Put on leg pads, chest protector, girdle (your choice), a catching glove, blocker, cup, mask, and use a goalie stick.

,
Watch the puck at all times, not the players (beginners).
On low shots, do not just fall to the ground.
Always try to smother the puck, to keep yourself from giving up a rebound.
Get up again -- get ready to stop another shot.
For high shots follow the puck through the air with your eyes and get a hand on it.

,
Remember that there is never a shot that you can't stop.
Remember that making a name for yourself is not important.

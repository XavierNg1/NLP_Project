Choose a training method.Some of the methods are as follows:


Operant conditioning.
Know that the most important part of the training is consistency.

,
With your deaf animal, using operant conditioning, you will need to decide on a signal to signify 'success' or 'yes'.
Using your 'yes' signal, (thumb up, or whatever you choose), make the signal and give the dog a treat.
Do this repeatedly, until you feel that your dog recognizes the connection.

,
Have a plan.
Once the connection has been made, teach your dog to watch you or focus on you.
Another way to train a particular behavior is to 'catch them in the act', and reward them.

Write an intent to vacate letter to your landlord.
Type the letter and sign it.
If you have not heard from your landlord within a few days call to follow up and find out how he or she wants to proceed.
If the landlord is not amenable to the prospect of having you show the apartment offer once again in writing, either via email or snail mail and remind the landlord that he or she is obligated to make a reasonable effort to rent the property at a fair value pursuant to 58-2565 (c) of the Kansas Residential and Landlord Tenant Act.
Move out on the date indicated in your intent to vacate letter.
If the landlord has not sent you a refund for your deposit within 14 days of your move out, send a letter officially requesting the refund.
Type and sign the letter and retain a copy.
If you are given service to appear in court via an attorney's office, send the landlord one final email reminding him or her that pursuant to 58-2547 (a) you cannot be held liable for your landlord's attorney's fees if he or she follows through with the suit.
If after all this, the landlord proceeds with the suit (or if you are ordered to small claims court), bring with you copies of your lease and all correspondence between you and your landlord.

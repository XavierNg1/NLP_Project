Avoid close personal contact.If you are caring for a loved one with MERS, it is key to avoid cuddling, kissing, and/or sharing cups and utensils.
Clean common areas of the house.If you are living under the same roof as someone with MERS, it is best to take hygiene precautions and to clean any shared areas of the house that may serve as a means for germ transmission.
Ask the infected person to cover their nose and mouth when they cough or sneeze.Since MERS is spread via respiratory secretions, asking the infected person to cover their nose and mouth when they cough or sneeze traps most of the infectious particles and prevents them from spreading through the air to others who may be around.

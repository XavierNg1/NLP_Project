Make sure you are standing with both your feet on the ground.
Keep your feet spread shoulder width apart.
When you have both of your feet firmly on the floor, look at where in the crowd you are.
If you are not at the front, look at the person in front of you.
Make sure that you have room to breathe.
If there is a sudden push, do not go with it.
If you have no choice but to be swept up by the crowd, make a cage around your chest with your arms to protect your ribs and your breathing, then use one foot at a time on the ground to keep yourself upright.

,
If, and when, you jump to the music, put your hands on the shoulders of the person in front of you.
At the end of the concert, try not to get in anyone's way.

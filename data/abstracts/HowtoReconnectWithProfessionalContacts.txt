When it comes to developing networks, the best advice is to never lose touch.
Time has a way of escaping us so it is completely understandable when people lose touch.
The first step to getting back in touch is reviewing your email archive.
Use Google, Twitter or LinkedIn to find out if you have up-to-date contact information.
Remember where that person worked and visit the organization's Web site.
Search for blogs and online journals.
Remind the contact where they met you.
Prepare for the meeting.
Keep in mind that relationship building is important for everybody and most people will be pleasantly surprised by your effort.

Prepare your drawing by keeping in mind the areas of color will overlap.
Bring up your lines along each side and diminish the size gradually to the back of the shell.
Add more colors with more vibrancy.
Fill in the lightly colored areas with a heavier pencil of the same colors you began with to darken some of the concave shapes for depth.
Put some more color around the background closest to the shell with a little amber and gold for contrast.

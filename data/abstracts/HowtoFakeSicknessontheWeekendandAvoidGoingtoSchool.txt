Prepare to sacrifice your weekend.
Start faking your sickness on either the later night hours of Saturday or the early morning hours of Sunday.
Start by complaining of pain in your stomach or saying that you have a headache.
Say that you had a nightmare.
Say you have a mild headache, but don't over-do it or your parents will suspect you of needing medicine and some of the side-effects in medicines honestly will affect you in a bad way if you take them when you're not sick.

,
Hint at the fact that you shouldn't go to school, saying something like, "How am I going to write with this headache?",
If your parents know you are notorious for faking sickness, you will have to be very smart and convincing about doing this.
Hopefully, after at least a day of being "sick", your parents will let you stay home.
Remember not to get "better" too quickly or your parents will suspect you just wanted the day off.
Also remember to fake a fever.
try to make your face look pale.
Act like you have no appetite.
Act like you are cold.
Don't get up and walk around a lot.
Be very clever and intelligent about this.
Think about possible things your parents could do.
Try making fake vomit or diarrhea.
Be loud during the night.
Don't try too hard to convince them you're sick.
Say that you feel slightly dizzy whenever you get up.
Do something to make yourself cold so that you will get goosebumps.
Go to bed late on Sunday night.
Go toilet a lot.

Prepare for your first day at work.
Arrive early and ready to work.Plan to be there at least 15 minutes early.
Turn your cell phone off.Until you know the rules, assume that using your cell phone during business hours is grounds for immediate termination (this assumption is not far from reality).
Prepare to be civil and cordial.Most of the bad workplace behaviors come from a lack of respect for others.
Introduce yourself to others with a smile.
Ask questions as they arise.You will not know how to do everything nor will you understand the processes on the first day.
Follow directions closely and precisely.
Review and expand your notes continuously.
Demonstrate consistently appropriate work behavior.
Read all employment information.
Complete any forms promptly.
Memorize people's names and relationships.Beyond just your boss and co-workers, you need to learn the names and relationships of people throughout the company.
Stay confident and relax.It's a new job and there's a lot to learn, but don't let it intimidate you.
Accept lunch invitations if offered.
Stay in business mode.Whether you are at lunch with a co-worker or at home posting on social media you shouldn't relax too much.
Work as a team player.

Plan in Advance- This is a very crucial part of your plan, this will give it the real effect and make your parents consider something is actually wrong with you.
Tricks up your sleeve- That night go to bed early to simulate being tired and drawn out but stay up as late as possible, to have a more sick and tired look about you in the morning, it is really helpful.
During your “Sick” Day- Try to stay in bed all day, watching TV and napping, don’t do anything too loud or anything that takes much energy, because your parents might come in and check on you during the day, and you could be in copious amount of trouble if caught faking.
Back to School- The next morning say you feel well enough to attempt to go back to school, eat your breakfast and get ready faster than the day before, it will make it seem you are getting better.

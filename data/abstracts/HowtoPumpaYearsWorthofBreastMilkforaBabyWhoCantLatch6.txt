Keep gradually reducing your pumping time until you find a balance that works for you.

,
Once you've got a long-term pumping routine, make a goal for getting out of it!,
Keep a running tally of your supply on hand.
When each shoebox fills up, store it at the bottom of the freezer.
While you are pumping, don't try to use thawed milk before it gets too "old.",
Don't offer frozen milk until you've stopped pumping fresh, with these exceptions:


First, if you run out of fresh milk or something is wrong with your supply, thawed breast milk is much better than formula.
Once your freezer is full, space your pumping even further apart.

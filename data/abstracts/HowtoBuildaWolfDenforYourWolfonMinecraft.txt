Get a dog.
Find a safe place for you both to live.
Put your wolf in a temporary den.
Find a nice quiet place to start building.

,
Build a small gateway, using wood, that is 5 blocks up, 5 blocks across and 5 blocks down again.

,
Get your fences again and fence the opening, leaving a gate there as well.

,
Continue the opening into a tunnel, which will widen out 10 blocks up.
Inside your new den, make a small 5x5 room, which should be enough to fit a bed in there.
Open the pen and let your wolf out.
You can build a den like this for other animals too.

Be aware that horses are mirrors.
Note that some horses are difficult whether you have a good attitude or not.
Choose an older horse if you're inexperienced.
Research the best method of controlling your emotions, and becoming confident.
Bear in mind that your horse is not a human, and does not think the same way you do.
Be more of a leader than a friend.
Learn gradually and methodically.
Be careful of what people term "abuse.",
Value trust over pandering to the horse's fears.

Purchase Rock Band 2 at any game store.
Get the guitar controller synced.
Create a character.
Select the first song you will play, either in Quickplay or in World Tour.
Now, place your first four fingers (your thumb is behind the buttons) with your left hand over the green, red, yellow, and blue (in that order) buttons on the neck of your plastic guitar and wait for the song to load.

,
Now the song will start, and the game will begin.
Remember that this works like a real guitar when it comes to playing notes: you can keep the fret buttons pressed down at any time without being penalised, as long as you press down the correct fret buttons and strum when the notes hit the "hitline".
If you are left-handed, remember to turn on lefty mode under options in the pause menu.

,
Try to play trough the song.
Congratulations, you have just learned how to play Rock Band 2 on Guitar!

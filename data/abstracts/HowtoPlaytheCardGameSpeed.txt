Deal two players a hand of five cards each.
Place four piles of cards face down in between the two players.
Divide the deck in half and create a draw pile of 15 cards for each player.
Start the game by flipping over the two middle cards.
Each player should try to place the cards in their hand on the active piles in ascending or descending order.
Each player should draw from his draw pile whenever he uses a card in his hand to make sure he always has five cards to play.
If both players can't play any of their cards, then they should both flip over a card from one of the side piles into the center piles.
When one player runs out of cards in his hand and draw pile, he must slap both piles of cards and say, "Speed!",
Play using doubles.
Put down more than one card at a time in descending or ascending order.
Use jokers as a wild card.
Play with three or four players.
Play Spit.
Split a deck of 52 cards into 2 equal decks.
Have each player organize his cards into 6 piles into 5 stock piles and 1 spit pile.
Begin the game by having each player flip a card from his spit pile into the center of the game.
Each player should place any cards that are face up on one of the center cards that are of ascending or descending value.
The players should draw from the stock piles if they cannot use any of their cards.
When a player has played all of the cards in his 5 decks, he should hit the center deck he wants and gain it.
Reshuffle the two spit piles to continue playing the game.
Keep playing until one player wins by running out of cards.

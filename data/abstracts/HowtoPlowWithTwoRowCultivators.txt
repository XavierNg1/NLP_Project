Plant your garden so that the rows are spaced suitable for cultivating with the equipment you have available.
Get an early start.
Set your plows to the appropriate spacing.
Make sure the plow points are at the correct depth.
Set the pitch of your plows.
Space the tractor tires properly for the crop you are planting.
Adjust your sway chains or sway bars so they have enough free travel to allow the plows to follow the path of your rows.
Set the depth of your plows at the correct level.
Plow at appropriate times.
Run at a speed which gives the desired results.
Locate the tractor wheels in the center between your rows.
Steer carefully so you do not plow up your crop.
Pull any weeds and debris from your plow points as needed, since they can accumulate and cause the soil to build up on the plows, resulting in the crop plants being covered from the overflow of soil.

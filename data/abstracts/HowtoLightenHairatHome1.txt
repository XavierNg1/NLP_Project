Rinsing hair with lemon juice is one of the most convenient ways to lighten it at home.
Buy lemon juice or make your own.
Wash your hair, and keep the lemon juice solution handy.
Rub the lemon juice into your hair while it is still wet.
Wait for 2-5 minutes, then wash out the shampoo and the lemon juice.
Rub conditioner into your hair to keep it from drying out.
Repeat the process once a week until your hair is the color that you want.

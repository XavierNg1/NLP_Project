What do actors want?,
Find out and understand your actors' abilities:


Emotional intelligence: they are flexible in their approach and can deliver a range of emotions.
Cast wisely.
Consider the following when auditioning:


Don't look for the perfect actor who fits with the vague ideal in your head, as this will cause a lot of anxiety and could put you off the project.
Keep in mind that the art of directing requires a substantial amount of confidence, which means you have to be very clear before you get to the set what you want from your actors.
Make the script legitimately interesting and respectable to everyone, not only those clawing at the opportunity to finally be in a movie.

,
Make sure that your actors take their work very seriously.
Meet with your actors before the shoot.
Make sure that your ideas for the scenes are made very clear during rehearsal.
Reinforce the importance of knowing the lines of the script.
Encourage them to research their characters deeply.

Melt your milk baking chocolate bar in a bowl in a microwave for 2-3 minutes.
Pour the melted chocolate into a Wonka mold.
Chill the bar in a refrigerator until solid.
Wrap the newly solidified bar in aluminum foil after removing it from the mold.
Go onto Microsoft Word or Paint and copy and paste a Wonka wrapper.
Print it off on poster paper.
Place and physically wrap your wrapper around the bar.
Enjoy your Wonka bar!

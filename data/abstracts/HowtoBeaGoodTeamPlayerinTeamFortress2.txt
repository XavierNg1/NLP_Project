Don't yell at people for their mistakes and/or failures.
Don't run around 'melee-ing' them the whole game.
Congratulate them on their good deeds, and thanks people like medics and engineers for healing you with their guns and dispensers.

,
Try to play the game correctly and well.
Stay together.
Don't diss the other team either - You may be paired up with them later.

,
If your team is complaining about your mic, just turn it off, don't continue talking or make fun of them because you're angry.

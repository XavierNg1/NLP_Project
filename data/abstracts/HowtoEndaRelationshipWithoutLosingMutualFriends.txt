Avoid talking about the breakup.
Don't ever trash talk your ex.
Be careful of what you reveal.
Stay in touch.
If you are already seeing someone new, keep the new lover away from the mutual friends.
Speaking of gatherings, don't assume you are the only one being invited.
Take the high road in all things.
Let time take care of the rest.

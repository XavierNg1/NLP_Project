Purchase ready-made pie crusts at your local supermarket if you don’t have time to make dough at home.
Opt to make the pie crust from scratch at home.
Measure the width of your pie dish with a measuring tape.
Split the dough into two equal sections.
Roll out your second half of the dough into a rectangle.
Wash a plastic ruler.
Decide if you want to cut your crust ribbons into three-fourth’s inch (1.9 cm) widths or half-inch (1.3 cm) widths.
Cut a small slit every half-inch or three-fourth’s inch (1.3 to 1.9 cm) across the width of the pastry rectangle.
Turn the ruler 90 degrees.
Realign the ruler with each slit.
Lift the parchment paper carefully onto a cookie sheet.
Remove the lattice strips from the refrigerator.
Lay ribbons horizontally across the diameter of the pie.
Work one side at a time.
Unfold the strips back down over the center strip.
Fold back every other strip, using the strips you left last time.
Repeat folding back half the horizontal strips, placing a vertical strip of dough across the pie and unfolding the strips until you reach the right edge of the pie.







,
Turn the pie 180 degrees and repeat with the unwoven side.
Pinch the point where the bottom crust meets the end of the lattice with your thumb and index finger.
Cut along the outside edge of the pie plate with a pastry wheel or pizza cutter.

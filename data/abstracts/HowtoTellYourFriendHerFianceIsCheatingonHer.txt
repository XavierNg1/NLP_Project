Take her to your house and watch a movie.
At the end tell her very gently.
If she cries comfort her.
Help her forgive and forget.
If she doesn't want to end the relationship DON'T PUSH HER TO DO IT OR GET MAD AT HER.
Make her tea and a cake, or bring her ice-cream or chocolates.
Remove any memories of her Fianc√© from her house as long as she lets you.

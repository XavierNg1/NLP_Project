Separate a four-inch wide section of hair from your crown.
Backcomb the hair section slightly with a teasing brush to create the base for your bump.
Take the teased section and loosely twist it a few times, leaving the straight half free and pointing downwards.
Use hair volumizing inserts to skip the teasing and cut down on style time.

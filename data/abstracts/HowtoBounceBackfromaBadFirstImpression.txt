Don't beat yourself up.
Show your sense of humor with a little self-deprecation.
Move on.
Wait a little while until you try another joke again.Telling jokes around people you first meet will always be hit or miss.
Acknowledge the mistake with sincerity, and apologize.Even though you may want to disappear into the back of your chair, the other person will only become more offended if you act as if nothing happened.
Avoid trying to justify or change what's been said.
Avoid over-apologizing.While it's important to acknowledge your mistake and try to make amends, please don't go into a long rant of endless apologies.
Give the person some space, if possible.
Project humility.
Try a pivot.Sometimes, a misstep is not so obvious and you may not be presented with an opportunity to apologize for something you said or did.
Don't pretend you're something you're not.Many social faux pas happen during first impressions because a person is putting on airs.
Ask for advice.

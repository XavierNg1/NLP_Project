Boil the potatoes in a large pot of water.
Drain the water from the potatoes, then let them sit in the pot over low heat until the moisture evaporates.
Mash the potatoes roughly using a fork or potato masher.
Saut√© the onion over medium-high heat.
Consider adding some carrots, shiitake mushrooms, and frozen peas for extra flavor.
Add the ground beef, and cook it until it browns, then season it with some salt and pepper.
Stir the meat mixture into the mashed potatoes, but leave the liquid behind.
Add a lightly beaten egg to the potato mixture, and still again until well-combined.
Let the mixture cool down enough to handle, then form it into "korokke" balls.
Let the korokke balls chill in the fridge for 15 to 30 minutes.
Dredge the balls in flour, egg, and Panko, in that order.
Fry the korokke balls in hot oil over medium heat until they turn golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.
Drain the korokke.
Serve the korokke.

Hand your friend a stack of twenty-one playing cards.
Deal the cards out face-up in three columns, working row-by-row (1st column-2nd column-3rd column, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, etc).
Gather the three columns into one stack of cards again.
Repeat the past two steps two more times.
Deal two piles of cards from a deck of 52 into equal piles of 26 each.
Give the spectator one of these piles and you keep the other.
Let the spectator know that you are going to make the number of red cards in your pile equal to the number of black cards in his pile.
Make the trick interesting by building it up any way you desire.
Amaze them with your magic trick.

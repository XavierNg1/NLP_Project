Become active on social-networking websites.
Add as many people as you can on Myspace, but save your Facebook for people that you know personally.
Try sitemodeling.
Add a cute, simple background to your page (preferably something like Hello Kitty or a Victorian wallpaper), upload a few flattering pictures of yourself, make a playlist of some of your favorite music, and send friend requests to other scene kids.
YouTube is also an important part of social networking.

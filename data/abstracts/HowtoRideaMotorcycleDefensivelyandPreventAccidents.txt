Maintain your machine properly.
Wear the proper clothes and equipment.
Ride with confidence and assertiveness, but not aggressiveness or timidness.
Be seen, be heard.
Turns and curves: "In the single vehicle accidents, motorcycle rider error was present as the accident precipitating factor in about two-thirds of the cases, with the typical error being a slide-out and fall due to over-braking or running wide on a curve due to excess speed or under-cornering" .

To prevent accidents at intersections, use cars as shields by passing through stoplights alongside cars and other vehicles, especially if you are able to position yourself where the other traffic is in the left lane blocking another car from turning left in front of you.
Watch out for that invisible bubble in traffic.
Stay in the safest lane.
When riding with other motorcycles, avoid lane sharing.

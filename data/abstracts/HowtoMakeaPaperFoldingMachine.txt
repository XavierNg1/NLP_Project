Gather your materials: a file folder, a ruler, scissors, scotch tape, and a pen.
Draw a rectangle on the file folder using a ruler.
Measure and label the panel divisions.
Cut out the rectangle once the measurements are done.
Trace out four triangular folds, and cut them out.
Tape the folds on each corner of the tri-folder.
Form the creases where you marked the panel divisions.
Insert a piece of paper into the triangular folds.
Fold panel A onto panel B, and then close with panel C. The harder you press on the panel folds, the sharper your paper folds will be.

,
Take out your paper from the folds.
Use it for all your folding needs!

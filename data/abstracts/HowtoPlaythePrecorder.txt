Blow into the instrument.
Place the precorder between your lips, and some people like the mouthpiece half inside their mouth.
Put the precorder the way you like it and whisper the word "Too" into the instrument.
Play any note except for High D, you need to look on the opposite side of the side with holes and then put your thumb on the one hole there.
Read your music and get ready to play with the precorder!

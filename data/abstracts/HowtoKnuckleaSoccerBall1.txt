Use a well inflated, full-size ball to practice.
Place your ball about 30 feet (10 meters) away from the goal.
Set up for your normal free kick run-up.
Approach the ball like you would for a normal strike with your laces.
Place your plant foot even with the ball, roughly six inches to the side.
Strike the ball with your laces, right below the very center of the ball.
Stop your follow through as soon as you hit the ball.

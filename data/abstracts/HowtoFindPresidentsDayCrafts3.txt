Get a piece of red, white and brown construction paper, craft glue, scissors, popsicle sticks and pennies for every child.
Tell the story of Abraham Lincoln's humble beginnings to your children.
Begin to craft Lincoln's 1-room log cabin.
Ask them to create a roof for the log cabin.
Ask them to cut a door and a window to glue them on top of the popsicle sticks.
Allow the glue to dry for 2 to 3 hours, and then allow them to take the craft home at the end of the day.

Remember that preparation is crucial.
Eat a good breakfast (full of fibre, protein ,carbohydrates and sugars) , but make sure you have several hours to digest it or else you'll get a stomach cramp.
Double tie your running shoes so when you're running your shoes will not come untied.
At the start of the race, stay with the pack.
Move through the first 800 meters pretty fast to make sure you get everything out of yourself - then you can tap into your full potential.
Look for key "landmarks" on the race.
If your legs start to hurt, don't slow down.
When your legs get tired, pump your arms; remember that your legs cannot outrun your arms.
Make competitive goals during the race like "I'm going to catch the kid in the red".
Keep your pace strong.
On downhills, you should let gravity bring you to a sprint.
Finish strong.
Never slow down before you get to the finish line!,
Sprint past the finish line so you don't slow down before the line and get a slower time.
Congratulate your team even if they had a bad race, team spirit makes all the difference!

,
If you do not come first, that's totally fine.

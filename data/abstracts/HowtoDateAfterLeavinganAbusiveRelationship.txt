Enjoy the feeling of being free.
Learn to be happy on your own.
Be careful when dating, stay away from stalkers, sweet talkers, and people that are "broken".
Once you are content with occasional dates, still loving the single life, enjoying all your time with your family, all your advancements at work, and freedom to decorate (or not decorate) as you see fit, it is possible that you will find somebody that you won't want to be away from.

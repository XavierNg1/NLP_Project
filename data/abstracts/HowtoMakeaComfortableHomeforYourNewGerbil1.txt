Gerbils should not be kept in a hamster cage - these are useless and boring to them.
Modular systems such as Rotastak and Habitrail are really not suitable for any rodent.
Gerbils should be kept in an aquarium with either a mesh lid or ideally a wire topper on the top.
Make sure that the lid and/or cage door are tightly closed, and even try testing them by nudging them a little.

Start off with a pistol and 500 points.
Round 2.
Once you have 1000 points or more than that, open the gate.
If you have enough points, buy a Thompson off the wall and buy bouncing betties.
In round 9, if there's one more zombie left, don't kill the zombie.
You also need to get a Wunderwaffe DG-2 and a PPSH-41.
Bouncing Betties are also important in this strategy.
Go to Comm.
Just keep doing the circles and you'll be fine.

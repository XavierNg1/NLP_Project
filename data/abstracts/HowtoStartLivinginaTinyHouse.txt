Do your research.
Decide what you need from your dwelling and what you want from your dwelling.
Look at the benefits of "living small:" less space to clean; less pack-ratting of unneeded clothes, broken appliances, etc.
Realize that small houses cost more per square feet than large houses.
Decide if you will build your own home from plans, or if you will buy an already made home new, or if you will buy a used home.
Pare down your belongings: we spend about 80% of our time wearing 20% of the clothes we own, so by getting rid of most of that wasted 80%, your life becomes immediately simpler: less laundry and less indecision about what to wear that day.
Be creative about storage and multi-function furniture: a bed platform could have clothing storage drawers underneath.

Plan to buy sewing scissors as an investment.
Go to a fabric or quilting store to buy your sewing scissors, not a drugstore or office supply place.
Look for recommendations from others who do a lot of sewing.
Ask to hold the scissors and, if possible, try them out on a scrap of fabric.
Consider how you will be using the scissors.
Protect your sewing scissors.

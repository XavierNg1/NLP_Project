Peel the onion, remove the stems, and dice very, finely.
Heat the onion, oil, and Â½ teaspoon (2.5 grams) of salt in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat.
Fry the onion until it turns golden brown, stirring every 20 seconds with a spatula.
Remove the onion from heat and set aside for 15 minutes, or until it cools.
In a medium-sized bowl, mix the sour cream, mayonnaise, garlic powder, white pepper, and the rest of the salt.
Add the cooled onion into the dip, and stir again.
Place the dip, covered, into the fridge for 1 hour.
Stir the dip again before serving.

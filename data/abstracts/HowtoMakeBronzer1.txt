Combine the ground cinnamon, cocoa powder, ground nutmeg, and cornstarch in a bowl.
Test the bronzer, and make any necessary adjustments.
Add some beet or hibiscus powder if you'd like it to double as a bronzer-blusher.
Add 10 to 15 drops of your favorite essential oil if you'd like a creamier bronzer, and stir it again.
Mix the ingredients well with a fork or mini whisk.
Transfer the powder into a clean container.
Use the bronzer.
Finished.

Beat the egg white with a fork until it becomes white and frothy.This will create a smooth base for your mask and make it easier to apply.
Stir in the honey or the lemon juice.
Apply the mixture on your face and leave it for 15 to 30 minutes.You can apply it with your fingers, or you can use a soft makeup brush for a more spa-like experience.

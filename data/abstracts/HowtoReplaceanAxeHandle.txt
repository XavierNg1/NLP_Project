Acquire a handle suited to your axe.
Remove the old handle.Because you won't be using the old handle, it doesn't matter if you damage it.
Clean the eye of the axe.Even if you take your time to eject the old handle from the blade, there may still be debris in there.
Mark the kerf of the new handle with a pencil.Many storebought handles will come with a pre-made kerf.
Test fit the handle.
Strike in the handle.In order to fit the handle into the blade, force will be needed even in the kerf offers space inside the blade eye.
Shorten the handle if necessary.
Fill in the kerf with a wedge.Filling in the opening on the other side of the axe's eye will prevent it from moving around as much.
Add metal wedges in the eye.To secure it further after wedging the kerf, add metal wedges by hammering them into place.
Saw off the protruding wedge.After you've worked on securing the handle from protruding side, it's a good idea to saw it down.
Tighten a loose handle with extra glue.If you have followed through with all of the stability measures and still aren't sure the handle will hold, you can fill whatever cracks that remain with glue.
Protect your handle with a coat of mineral oil.Bottles of mineral oil are relatively cheap, and can be used to restore life to a drab handle.
Put your axe to use.

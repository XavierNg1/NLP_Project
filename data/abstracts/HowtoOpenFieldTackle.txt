Make sure you don't stay too low or too high.
As the ball carrier moves closer, do not cheat to one side.
Run but don't go into a full sprint to the carrier.
As you approach him, get into a full squat and wrap up near the stomach or waist-down.
Be ready to jump on him once he makes a juke near you, and wrap up.
If he comes at you at full speed, do not be afraid to get low and wrap up.
Take him down and make sure he is down.

Have a disaster kit with the basic supplies in your home.
Right after the storm, avoid driving if at all possible.
Explore your property and avoid any unsafe conditions.
If there was some flooding, use the small gas powered water pump to clear your house.
Now that you know you are safe at home, get ready to hold up there until power comes back and water service is restored and safe to drink.

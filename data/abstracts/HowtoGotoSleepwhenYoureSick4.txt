Know how you react to your medication.
Avoid cold and flu medications that include ephedrine or pseudoephedrine.You might have to read the small print on the packaging to see what’s really in your medication, but avoid these drugs, specifically, if you’re trying to get a good night’s sleep.
Decode the medication’s packaging.Over-the-counter medications often make claims on their packaging that are geared more toward advertising for sales than informing for treatment.
Be wary of “nighttime” formulas in general.Although nighttime formulas may well get you to sleep quickly, the quality of sleep you get from such medications isn’t healing, restorative sleep.

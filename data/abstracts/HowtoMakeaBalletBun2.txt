Spritz your hair with some water before beginning.
Add a little texturizing spray before "bunning" for a better hold.
Use your other hand to curl the hair around your ponytail.
Split the ponytail down the middle and build the bun in two parts.
For extra security, cover your bun with a hair net that matches your hair color.

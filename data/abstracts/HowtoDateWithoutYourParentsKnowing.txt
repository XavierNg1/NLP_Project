Consider how dating without telling your parents affects your relationship with your parents.
Remind yourself that you're still young.
Think carefully about actually asking if you can date.
Hang around your date with other people.
Use your best friend as an excuse.
Avoid using social media to connect.
Don't text your date loving stuff if your parents check your phone so often!

,
Don't do anything that would make the fact that you're dating easy to notice, like getting hickeys.

,
Stay calm and on an even keel.
Keep covering as best you can.
Deny it.
Keep it from friends if possible.
If your boyfriend or girlfriend wants to meet your parents, be ready to explain.

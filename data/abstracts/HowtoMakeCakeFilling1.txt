Buttercream is practically the mother of all frostings.
In a large bowl, cream the butter and shortening until they are both mixed in thoroughly or until the mixture is very pale.
Gradually mix in your sugar a cup at a time, remembering to scrape the sides often.
Add the milk.
When not using, keep away from heat and direct sunlight.

Communicate in stealth: If your preferred mode of communication is texting use the Snapchat.
Be professional: Between 9 and 5, romance must appear to be the last thing on your mind.
Arrange rendezvous: Set times and places to meet where you know you will get some privacy.
If meeting after hours pick a place far from your work location, you will be easily spotted in the pub on the corner.
Don't leave any evidence: this can be anything from an undeleted email, to lipstick marks, to misplaced underwear.
Head off the gossip: at some point, someone will start to get suspicious.
If you decide to have an extended lunch break, always ask permission from your boss first and only if your boss says it's OK.
Do not show public displays of affection.
Remember professionalism and discretion in the workplace is key.

Before we start, here's the lowdown on Tom Nook.
Think to yourself: How long have you had the store?,
Have a friend visit your town via tag mode and make them buy something from your store - even if it is something as cheap as a pack of flower seeds!

,
Buy, buy, buy!

,
Look out for special offers like the 5 Times Point Special - buy one day for five times the points for every purchase and Spotlight Products - rare items!

,
After about 3 weeks at least, if this hasn't kicked in, keep trying and waiting.
Note: if you have not bought at 5 times point special you can see how much money you spent by multiplying your points by 100

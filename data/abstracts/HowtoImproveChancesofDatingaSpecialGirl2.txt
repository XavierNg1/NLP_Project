Once you've decided where your feelings lay, start slowly building a relationship with her.
Start conversations with her; don't wait for her to start it!,
Start sitting with her at lunch, if you can.
Help her when she needs it.
Walk with her to class, if possible.
To get her to laugh, tell her short but funny jokes.
Try joining any clubs she is in; you need not be in every single club she is attending, but just the ones you are comfortable with.
Do your homework with her.
If you're close enough with her, and she appears upset, gently ask her if she wants to talk about it.
Slowly but surely make your way into her lunch group, and also bring a few of your friends along so you aren't alone.

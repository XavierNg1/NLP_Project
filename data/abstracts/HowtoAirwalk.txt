Stand with your feet side by side.
Move one foot straight in the air in front of the other foot.
As your weight transfers to the toes of that foot, glide it back to its original position.
When the first foot moves back to its original position, the other foot should point up on its toes.
Move the other foot up and forward and repeat.
Keep moving forward.

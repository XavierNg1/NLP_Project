Begin by assembling supplies for the helmet.
Cut the brim off the hat with scissors.

,
Cut two five inch pieces from the styrofoam circle and taper and round out the ends of the horns with a serrated steak knife.
Test how the horns will look by holding them up to the sides of the hat using the seams in the hat as guides to get them symmetrically aligned.
Run wire through each horn to attach it to the baseball hat.
Tape the horns onto the hat using 3" pieces of duct tape you have torn in advance and lined up along the table's edge for easy access.
Wrap the entire hat, horns and all, with 12" pieces of duct tape.
Trim the hat with fur by hot gluing a strip cut from an old hat around the entire opening of the helmet.  

,
For rivets, use scrunched up 1" pieces of tape.
Look up Viking head dress or Viking helmet for ideas on how to finish and embellish the helmet.

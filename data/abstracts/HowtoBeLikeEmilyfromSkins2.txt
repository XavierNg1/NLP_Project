Look for bright skirts with stripes, flowers, or other pleasing patterns.
On top, plain or vintage tees and tank tops are always a great bet.
Cardigans, also, are a must in emulating Emily's style.
A nice, fitted black coat is acceptable, as is a classy scarf in blue or red- anything bright and cheerful.
Emily has a wide variety of shoes.

The first thing to do when planning an expedition is to come up with a mission statement.
Use a map to plan your route to and from your destination.
Study books about previous expeditions to the area.
Decide on a start date and an end date for your expedition.
What type of ground will you be covering?,
Are there any natural sources of food or water along your planned route?,
Are there any deadly creatures you should watch out for along the way, such as snakes or poisonous spiders?,
Make a list of everything that could go wrong on the expedition.
Assign each member of your team an essential duty.
Use all the information you have gathered to write up a trip plan.

Use locally based volunteer activities, for example:


Someone has to build an organization within the Precincts.
Seek larger Area Coordinators, each supervising and communicating with several of the Campaign Precinct Captains.
Encourage and praise the volunteers who do double and triple duty until the roster is complete.

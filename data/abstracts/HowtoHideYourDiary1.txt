Hide it anywhere no one will find it:


Find an old book and cut a hole in it so your diary will fit.
Put your diary inside a desktop computer.
Put your diary online.
Tape it to the underside of a chair, desk, table, or interior of a drawer.

,
Put it under a loose floorboard in a hardwood floor (best for old houses).

,
Make a hollow book and put your diary inside.

,
Act natural when anyone comes into your room as if you have nothing to hide.
Make a decoy.
See if there is enough room to stick the diary between the back of a framed picture and the wall.
Lift a removable ceiling panel (if you have one) and place your diary (or anything else you have to hide) on one next to it.
Slip your diary inside a newspaper roll, and set the newspaper next to your chair, on the shelf, wherever a newspaper looks natural but discreet.
Hide it under a chest of drawers, under the bottom drawer, where the floor is.
Find an old tissue box.
Hide it in an old Bible case.

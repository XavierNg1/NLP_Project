Find and clean empty canisters.
Measure the circumference of your canister with a fabric measuring tape.
Choose an assortment of complimentary ribbons.
Measure and cut a piece of solid or patterned scrapbooking paper, if your canister is damaged or has bright colors on it.
Cut your strips of ribbon according to the circumference of the canister.
Squeeze a thin strip of hot glue onto the back ends of the ribbon that will go on the bottom of your canister.
Repeat the process with the next ribbons, making sure they overlap each other slightly.
Allow the project to dry for 30 minutes.
Affix another layer of ribbons to any spaces that are not covered.
Add embellishments, such as buttons or monogrammed pieces of paper.
Finished.

Never talk badly about other people behind their backs, no matter what.
Be nice to everyone!,
Occasionally when it's needed, try putting others before yourself.
Don't tell someone else's secrets!,
Stay out of other people's drama!,
Note: If you fight fire with fire, you'll end up getting burned.

Do not deny something when someone asks you "did you do this?

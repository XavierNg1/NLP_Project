Get the cage before anything else.
Remember that mice are social animals.
Don't forget to get several coconut/igloo/hammock hideouts for your mice to hide in.
Add substrate.
Add bedding.
Add some hay.
Get a medium-sized rodent wheel for your mouse so it can get some exercise.
Get toys, toys, and more toys!,
Don't forget to buy food, and small food bowls.
Consider getting rescue mice.
Look for mice that get along and go for at least a trio of them - but make sure you've chosen a big enough cage.
Set up the cage!

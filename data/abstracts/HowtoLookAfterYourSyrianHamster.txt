First you need to write down a list of names to call your pet hamster.The names can be anything you want Ex: Bob, Fred, Hammy, Daisy, Lilly, Honey, etc.
Before you get your hamster you need to go to your local pet shop.
Also the day before you get your hamster it is a good idea to make a spreadsheet like the one on the picture.
It is best to buy your hamster in the late afternoon to the evening, because hamsters tend to be more awake by then.
When you get the hamster it will come in a couple of boxes.
When you get home open the box and put the hole by the cage door and let the hamster run out.
Tame your hamster slowly by letting it get used to your hand, voice, and scent.

Use the minor tuning to play big, 6-string minor chords easily.
Tune the G (3rd) string down to F, the B (2nd) string down to A, and the E (1st) string down to D. Use an electronic tuner, or search online for a video or clip of someone playing the tuning, if you tune by ear.

Bar across all 6 strings with the index finger, and bar the last five strings with the third finger, two frets up.
Simplify to 4-string chords to get even faster, chunkier chords.
Add the 5th string back in with your index finger for an extra bass note.

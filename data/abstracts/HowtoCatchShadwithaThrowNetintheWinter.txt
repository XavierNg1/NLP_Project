Be aware that in the winter, bait (shad) is notoriously difficult to find and catch.
Go deep in the cold water.
Search hard to find a place where the shad have been attacked by predatory fish, like stripers or catfish.
Add sufficient handle to the net to reach the target depth.
Cruise slowly while watching the sonar for a large number of flashes in a single spot.
Steadily pull the net back up to the boat and grab the "horn" of the net.
Rinse the net.
Prepare the shad.

Determine if your texture contains asbestos- you can get a test kit for that.
Take your furniture out of the house if possible (having the furniture there makes a huge mess.),
Determine if the ceiling texture has been painted over.
Definitely wear masks when you are scraping.
Be really careful when scraping so that you donâ€™t rip into or scrape the drywall.
Scrape as much as you can off.Any little chunk will show through the texture.

,
Once it is all scraped off, use dry wall patch to even out areas or repair where you ripped through the drywall (I had a lot of those spots!).
You will want to sand the entire ceiling after you patch.

,
You can either do the retexturing yourself or hire someone to do it.
Paint all the ceilings with "primer/ sealer"?.

,
Paint it all over again with plain white ceiling paint (which is really cheap).

,
All in all, it is very worth it.

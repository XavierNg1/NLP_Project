Roll the clay in a ball;
,
Slowly pinch a neck-make sure one side is pretty flat, the neck has to be toward the top of the flat side.

,
Push your thumb on the opposite side of the neck-keep pushing till you hit the neck.
Close up the back.
Find a pencil, back of a pen, etc.
Take the same tool and make a hole in the middle of the neck press through all the way till you can see the tool through the opening on the top.
Depending on which type of clay you used, cook it in the oven, kiln if you have one or let it dry.

,
Paint!,
Enjoy!

Arrange cups 10 on a side, in pyramid formation.
Each beer pong team of two starts off with one ball.
Drinking is alternated.
As soon as the ball touches anything, including a cup, it's fair game to be grabbed.
Re-stack cups into pyramids when 6 cups and 3 cups remain on a side.
When the last cup on a side is hit, the losing team has the opportunity to match, getting one or two balls to shoot depending on whether or not the winning team used both shots.
Any cups left on the side of the winning team must be consumed by the losing team.

Move your head and chant the "om" mantra in your head.
Move your shoulders so that all tensions resolve.
Move your spine to the right and the left side.
Move your feet on the ground.
Massage your body from head to feet.
Move your hand and send light to your loved ones and to all people.
Rub your palms together.
Put your hands on your legs or your belly.
Stop your thinking for a minute.
Done!

Women want to see a headshot of your face, with nice eyes and a nice smile.
Female online daters also want to see a full body shot so they can see your actual physique.
Women also have a thing for nice butts.
Women on dating sites like SexSearch.com also want to see photos of you showing off your fun side.
Really, women just want to see that you look like a nice, normal, friendly, and approachable guy…they don’t want to date someone who looks like they belong in an insane asylum, you feel us?

If you’re going to wear shades in your photo, just make sure you have an additional photo of yourself without wearing any shades.

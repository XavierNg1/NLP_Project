Decide what animals and plants you want to keep.
Purchase a suitable sized aquarium or terrarium, remember animals like to move around and plants need room to grow.
If this is a temperate or tropical vivarium build a false bottom.
Install the background and hardscape.
Install a top.
Install a light.
Install equipment.
Add substrate.
Add dechlorinated water.
Plant the plants, leaving room for the plants to grow and 'fill in'.
Turn on the vivarium and let it 'stabilize' for 24 hours to several weeks.
Quarantine your newly purchased, and researched, animals to assess their health.
Add your quarantined animals to the vivarium and monitor their acclimation closely for the first week or two.

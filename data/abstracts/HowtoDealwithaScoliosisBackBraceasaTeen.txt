Look at your back brace in a different way.
Embrace your back brace because it is embracing you.
Remember that it will be great when that appointment comes and the doctors announce that they are lowering the amount of hours you wear it.Remember that if you are out of the brace for a long time, you are just hurting yourself and getting closer and closer to surgery.
Remember to take it off to stretch.

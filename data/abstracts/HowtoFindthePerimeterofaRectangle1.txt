Write down the basic formula for finding the perimeter of a rectangle.
Find the length and the width of your rectangle.
Add the length and width.After you identify your length and width, you want to plug them into the “l” and “w” slots in the perimeter equation.
Multiply the sum of the length and width by two.
Add l + l + w + w. Instead of adding two sides of your rectangle and multiplying by two, you can simply add all four sides together directly to find the perimeter of your rectangle.

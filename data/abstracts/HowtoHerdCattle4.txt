Move cattle from the pasture or corral using the steps from the sections above into a holding pen.
Move a smaller group from the main holding pen (or one of them if there is more than one such pen) into a smaller pen or holding alley.
Move the first small group into the crowding tub or bud box.
Put them down the working alley from the tub or box.
Encourage movement into the squeeze by walking in the opposite direction that they are to go.
Process each animal in the squeeze or head-gate, or just hold them for a few seconds then release them.

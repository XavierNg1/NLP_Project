Try this simple test to see the difference between how fins work compared to other brands.
While seated, cross your ankle over your knee, grab your toes and pull them in the direction of the sole of your foot.
Now, grab the foot in both hands; one holding the heel, the other holding the top of the foot, pull again toward the sole of the foot and resist with the leg.
To measure your ankle flexibility, sit on the floor with legs extended and place a stiff piece of paper against the side of the foot.
Measure the distance from the base of your big toe to the ground or floor; your goal should be from one to four inches.
Avoid "very long" or vented, scuba style fins.
Use your fins.

Plant your feet flat on the ground, toes slightly outward.
Position the bar behind your head, with the weight on your upper back.
Bend your knees and slowly lower your hips as if to "sit" on an invisible chair.
Contract your abs as you move through the squat.
Push straight back up, lifting your hips up and forward to lift toward starting position.

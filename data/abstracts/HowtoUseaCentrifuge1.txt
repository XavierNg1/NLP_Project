Inspect centrifuge bottles/tubes for cracks before use.Because a centrifuge can spin at such high speeds, a liquid sample can easily become an aerosol if it is not properly contained.
Cap tubes with the proper lid.
Clearly label tubes for identification.
Wipe the outside of the tube with disinfectant before placing it in the centrifuge.
Make a counterbalance for the centrifuge tube you want to put in the centrifuge.

Next you are going to startup your FireFox web browser and go to a site which has embedded flash videos in it, such as CNN Videos.Please allow the flash video to play/load in the web browser until it is completely finished playing/loading or completely loaded into the browsers cache.
Keep your FireFox web browser open with the flash video completely loaded and simply return to your open terminal and run the FlashVideoCapture.pl script by issuing the following command below.
If this was done correctly, you will see a statement such as this:


/proc/13509/fd/28 -> foundflash.1.flv

This means the flash video was captured as foundflash1.flv.
Now it is time to playback your captured *.flv video files.Congratulations, at this point you can rename the foundflash1.flv to anything you like.

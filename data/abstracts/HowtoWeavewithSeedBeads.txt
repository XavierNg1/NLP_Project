Learn a bit of terminology.
Learn the differences between normal bead weaving and seed bead weaving.
Warp the loom for seed bead weaving.
String the loom so that you can slip the thread off the dowel holder without clipping all the threads.
Tie the other end down with a double knot as well (on the opposite side from your starter knot) around the pin on the dowel.
Thread your needle and secure the weft thread (white) with a double knot to the warp thread (pink).
Slip 8 beads onto your needle and pass it through UNDER the warp threads.
Push the needle back through the beads over the top of the warp threads, making sure that you do not split the thread.

,
Continue weaving your beads until you have reached the required length for your item.
Thread and sew the beginning weft thread through a row of beads to tidy it off.
Loosen one dowel slightly and turn the pin towards the woven strip so that the threads can fall off the pin.

,
Lift all the threads off being careful not to pull on them and so warp your strip.
Gently lift your work over the loom and it will automatically slip off the pin on the other side.
Instead of loose threads hanging off the sides, you should now have little loops.

,
Start with a thread at or near the centre, to leave enough thread either side of the bracelet to finish off your work and still have enough thread to add a clasp.

,
Hold the work firmly in one hand and start by pulling the centre thread.
Continue doing this until all the threads are pulled through.

,
Use the two remaining threads to add a clasp or finish the piece however you want.

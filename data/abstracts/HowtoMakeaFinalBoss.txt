This is probably the most blatantly obvious but important step: Make sure the final boss has a major role in the story!,
Make sure it's hard.
Try to make it epic!,
Have music that is very catchy and all but impossible not to like.
Make sure their health is high compared to the other bosses (except for optional bosses and bosses that you are supposed to deliberately lose against, although optional bosses can be weaker than the final boss).

,
While the boss should be very hard, make sure that they are beatable.
Get the right instruments.
Try to see how hard the final boss is without various items that are in the arena.
Make it your own.

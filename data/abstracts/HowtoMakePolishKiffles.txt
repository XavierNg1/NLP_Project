Separate the 4 egg yolks from the egg whites using an egg separator.
Save the egg whites in the fridge in a covered container to avoid contamination.
Beat the egg yolks, gently, using a fork or a whisk.
Add the cup of sour cream to the slightly beaten egg yolks.
Blend together the two cups regular margarine butter with the four cups of flour in a separate, larger bowl than the bowl that contains the egg yolk-and-sour cream mixture.
Pour the contents of the small bowl (the egg yolks and sour cream) into the larger bowl with the flour and butter.
Knead with your hands until the dough is soft and smooth.
Cut a generous sheet of wax paper and set it down on the kitchen counter.
Wrap the dough in the wax paper.
Refrigerate the wax-paper-wrapped dough overnight.

,
Chop the walnuts into chunks about the size of peas or a little smaller.
Find the four egg whites that you kept refrigerated after separating the eggs to make the dough.

,
Mix together all the chopped walnuts, sugar, egg whites, and vanilla in a large mixing bowl.

,
Cover the top of the walnut-filling bowl with a sheet of plastic wrap.
Refrigerate the walnut filling for about ten minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

,
Line several baking sheets with tin foil.
Remove the dough and the walnut filling from the refrigerator.

,
Prepare the kitchen counter for rolling out the dough by sprinkling it with some loose flour.
Divide the dough ball with a knife into wedges that are easy to roll.
Roll the dough wedge you are working with into a ball and lightly sprinkle it with some more flour.
Set the powdered dough-ball onto the powdered counter and begin the rolling process by just pushing your hand down on the dough in the center.
Use the powdered rolling pin to roll out the dough ball.
Stop rolling out the dough when it is as thin as it can be without holes poking through.
Cut off the frayed, imperfect edges of the dough to make a clean rectangular shape and discard the dough edges for now.

,
Cut the rolled dough-rectangle into even squares.
Place the dough-squares, evenly spaced, onto a previously prepared tin-foil-lined baking sheet as you work.

,
Continue rolling more and more dough, incorporating the discarded edges into new dough balls until all the dough has been used and is on baking sheets.

,
Use the fork you left in the walnut-filling mixing bowl to scoop a little bit of filling into the center of each dough-square on the baking sheets.

,
Fold two corners opposite each other on each dough-square as if the dough-square were hugging the walnut filling.
Bake in the oven starting at 10 to 12 minutes for each baking sheet.
Allow the kiffles to cool on the baking sheet (or eat them warm!,
Sprinkle some powdered sugar on the top of the kiffles.

,
Enjoy!

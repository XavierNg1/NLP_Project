Ask him why he's interested in you.
Watch how they act when they tell you why they're interested in you.
If he is a really genuine person imagine you are in his shoes.
Calmly and gently say that you are really sorry, but you don't see him in that way.
Apologize for leading him on or giving him signs, even if you didn't notice or mean to.

,
Wait for his reply.
Change the subject, where possible, and try to act like it hasn't happened.
Imagine you are the boy... it probably took a good while for him to build up the courage to ask you out.

,
You can always tell him that you are flattered that he asked you out, but that you're not interested in pursuing something romantic with him.

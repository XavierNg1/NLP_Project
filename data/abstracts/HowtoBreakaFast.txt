Set a timeline depending on how long you've been fasting.
Make a meal plan.
On Day One, focus predominantly on drinking fruit or vegetable juice.
Supplement your fruit/vegetable juice with vegetable or bone broths.
Start introducing raw fruit into your diet, especially if your fast was on the shorter side.
During this time, avoid citrus fruits like lemons or oranges and fibrous fruits like pineapples.
Add in yogurt.
Pay attention to your body during this time.
Incorporate vegetables.
Add some grains and beans.
Make sure that your body is doing well before you introduce a whole bunch of things.
Eat small portions.
Chew food well.
Know that diarrhea and frequent evacuations are common after reintroduction of solids.
Know that gas and constipation is also relatively common.
Know that too much variety, especially when reintroducing solids, can cause digestive problems.
Beware of foods with a lot of oil during the first week of breaking the fast.

Lower yourself into the water and put your hand with the handboard outstretched in front of you.
Once you are in position where the waves are breaking, turn around and face the shore, while keeping your attention on the approaching waves.
Position the arm with the handplane outstretched in front of you.

As the wave rolls towards you, kick hard and use your free arm in a freestyle swim stoke for that extra push.

At this point you've picked your line, and now itâ€™s the point of no return so don't hesitate.
Angle your handboard across face of the wave to allow for longer surfing time.

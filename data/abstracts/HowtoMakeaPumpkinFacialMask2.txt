Make a pumpkin and oatmeal mask if you have acne or want something a little more exfoliating.
Put 2 tablespoons of canned pumpkin purée into a small cup or bowl.
Add 1 tablespoon of oatmeal.
Pour in 1 teaspoon of jojoba oil.
Consider adding ½ teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.
Use a fork to mix everything together.
Apply the mask to your face.
Wait 10 to 15 minutes.
Wash the mask off with lukewarm water.

In CityVille, harvesting crops provides you with goods which can be used to supply any shops or businesses you open in your new city, so obviously this is a vital part in running your town.

To plant crops, you will have to lay down some farm plot to grow your crops on.
Open the 'Build' menu again, but this time click the 'Goods' tab.
Once the crops have grown, click on the crop to harvest.

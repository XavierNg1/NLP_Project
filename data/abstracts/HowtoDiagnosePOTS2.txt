Have your doctor measure your heart rate sitting and standing.POTS is a form of "autonomic dysregulation" (a nervous system disorder) in which your heart rate spikes upon standing (among other symptoms).
Have your blood pressure measured as well.After your doctor measures your heart rate and its variance when you are sitting versus standing, she will also want to measure your blood pressure.
Know that the heart rate criteria are different for children and adolescents.Children and adolescents have naturally faster heart rates than adults; therefore, their heart rate must increase by at least 40 BPM (beats per minute) when they make the transition from sitting to standing, in order to be diagnosed with POTS.

Reread your whole story, top to bottom, fixing grammatical and spelling errors before you start redefining your characters.
When you come to a point in your book where you're introducing your character, be descriptive!,
Remember: The better the reader knows the character, the better they can understand later actions in the story.
Give the character his own action phrase, or word.
Name their likes and dislikes throughout the story.
Note if the character is sarcastic, funny, rude, etc. and apply that to most of the character's dialogue.
Your alter ego is very important.
"Read between the lines" is a good tool.
Make character's bad habits apparent (biting nails, lying, disorganization).
People subconsciously do things, apply the actions to the character.
Apply all the rules above to all the other characters, starting from most important to least.

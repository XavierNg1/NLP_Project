Think about the situation logically.
When you feel nervous, tell yourself calmly that planes are safe.
Make yourself as comfortable in your seat as possible.
Just because you’re on the airplane doesn’t mean your mind has to be.
Relieve your stress with simple exercises if you feel that your emotions are just too out of control or that you can’t concentrate on anything else.
Once you're in the air and feel a little better (like after you’ve done some relaxation exercises), distract yourself!,
Pretend that you love flying.
Talk to someone.
Sleeping is a good option for flights.
The biggest thing is to distract your mind and control your stress when it reaches a high point.

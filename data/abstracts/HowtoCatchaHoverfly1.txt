Wander through your garden to see if you can find any Hover Flies.
Until you have spotted a Hover Fly, walk slowly to the area where you have spotted a Hover Fly.
Look at the Hover Fly, is it staring at the plant or you?,
Once you can see and feel that the Hover Fly is not looking at you and is comfortable, you now can pull your hand towards the Hover Fly very slowly.
If it is not moving, put your hand very, very close to the Hover Fly; don't worry, the Hover Fly won't go away!,
Stay there again and look at the Hover Fly.
Now just slowly pull your fingers very close the the Hover Fly and what you are trying to do is to catch it's wings; not the body.

,
Strike!,
Once you have caught it; hold its wings firmly or else it would easily fly away.

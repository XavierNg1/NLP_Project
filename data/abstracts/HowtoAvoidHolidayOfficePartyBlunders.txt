Don't Skip the Party


Thinking of not attending?,
Do not Forget to Wear Your Smile and Make a Positive Impression


This is the time to make those around you feel comfortable and enjoy getting to know you.
Remember to leave the Uninvited Guests at home.
Never Make Assumptions About Who You Are Talking To


Are you certain of this person's position or alliances within the company?,
Remember where you are at.
Absolutely, do not get Drunk and Tell Your Boss How You REALLY Feel


Cocktails make for loose lips that sink ships!,
Don't Limit Your Conversation to "Shop Talk"


You approach the Manager of Test, introduce yourself and then, well, what do you say?,
Move around.
Remember.
Never Assume People Will Forget Your Blunder


So, you stepped in it.

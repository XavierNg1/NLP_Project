Obtain the necessary materials.
Purchase a solar pathfinder.
Get a loop system.
Use temperature sensors.
Get a heat exchanger.
Ensure that you have the right valves.
Choose the location of where you would want to put the system.Using what is called a solar pathfinder, see how much sunlight your location will actually get over the course of a year.If the solar pathfinder produces unfavorable results, find a new location and repeat until a reliable choice is made.
Create a plan for plumbing runs and piping runs.
Once the location has been chosen, it is now time to choose the type of panel you want to use.
Once the panel is chosen, buy the steel framing.
Once the frame is connected, run wiring from back of the collectors down to where the control box will be.Verify that the piping that is going to be used is the right size and in good condition.Begin running the piping down to where the collector will attach to the water tank.
Be sure to check seals.
Make sure a loop is run from the collector back to the tank.
As the piping is being installed, make sure that ball and check valves are installed periodically for maintenance reasons.
Install the heat exchanger.
Install temperature sensors at all the inlet and outlets of the system.
Once the system is connected, hook up the electrical wiring to the sensors, valves, heat exchanger, and solar collector to the control unit box.
Once the system is up and running, install a wireless feed that will send the efficiency results every day to an email.

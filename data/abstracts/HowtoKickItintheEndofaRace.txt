Motivate yourself to win.
Focus on the finish line.
If you are in front, don't bother looking behind you.
If you are coming from behind, don't worry about how far behind you are.
Right before you pass the finish line, bend down so your chest passes before your legs.
Say "good job" and shake the hand of the person you were neck and neck with at the end of the race.

,
Make sure you get some water, cool down, and stretch.
Evaluate yourself after the race.
Good Luck!

,
Get adrenaline for the last few meters and go all the way pretend that the finish line is a few meters back that way you sprint all the way to the end.

Plan ahead.
Identify what kind of kid you are going to photograph: a shy kid or a restless one?,
Make friends with the children.
Does your camera have "Kids & Pets Mode" or an "Action" mode?,
Be a kid.
Allow the children to make faces or silly poses.
Use soft colors.
Resort to bribery.
Go for candid shots.
For shy kids...
Shoot a lot and shoot fast.
Have fun... and go wild!

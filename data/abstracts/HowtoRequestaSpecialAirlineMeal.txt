Contact the airline at least 24 hours prior to your flight's scheduled departure time.
Understand that on most shorter routes (typically domestic and charter flights), special meal requests may not be granted or even necessary.
Specify the special meal you would like to request.
If you want to avoid any unwanted surprises when your special meal is served, visit the airline's website beforehand and browse a menu if available.

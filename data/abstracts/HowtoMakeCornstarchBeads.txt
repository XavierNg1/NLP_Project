Combine the flour, cornstarch, and salt.
Roll the dough into small balls (these will be your beads) and poke a hole into each one with a pencil, knitting needle, or toothpick.
Put the clay beads on a covered cookie sheet and allow them to dry outside on a sunny day.
When the clay is dry, itâ€™s ready for beading.If you want, you can coat the beads in lacquer or varnish them before beading so that you don't have to worry if they fall in water and it also gives a shiny finish.

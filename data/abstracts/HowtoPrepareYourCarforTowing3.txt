Consider using a special towing device.
Decide to disconnect the axles.
Get under your car.
Locate the drive shaft(s), and find where it connects to the differential you want disconnected.
Use your strap or bungee cord to secure the drive shaft to your undercarriage.
Remove the four bolts.
Push the drive shaft up as far as possible.
Screw the bolts you removed back into the yoke on the differential housing.
Repeat this process for your other axle, if you have one.
Tow your car.

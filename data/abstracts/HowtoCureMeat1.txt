Decide what kind of meat you'd like to use.
If necessary, trim off any excess fat, tendons, or meat.
For larger cuts of meat, consider stabbing the meat with a prong for better salt coverage.
Decide whether you want to cure with a pre-mixed curing salt or mix your own.
Use a ratio of 2:1000 sodium nitrite and salt, if mixing your own curing salt.
Mix up your spices along with your curing salt.
With your hands, rub the curing salt and and spice mix over the entire cut of meat.
Refrigerate the meat for 7 to 10 days.
After 7 to 10 days, remove from the refrigerator and rinse off all the salt/spice mix.
Roll up the meat (optional).
Wrap the meat in tightly cheesecloth.
Truss your meat to help it keep its shape while it ages (optional).
Label the meat and hang in a cool, dark place for anywhere from two weeks to two months.
Serve.

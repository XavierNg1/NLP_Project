Start by drawing vertical and horizontal lines or guidelines on Barbie’s head.
Draw her long hair by sketching flowing lines from the top of her head to below it.

Draw the details of her face such as her eyebrows, eyes, nose and lips.
After drawing her head, you can now draw her body.
From your drawn guideline, draw her neck, upper body and arms.
Next, draw her lower body.
Connect your drawn circles and ovals to her head and body in order to emphasize further her silhouette.
Add details to her hair, dress and hands by sketching lines that can copy the movement of her hair and dress.
Then add her accessories.
You can now outline your drawing.
Finally add final touches to your drawing by adding graphic stripes to Barbie’s dress, bracelets, eyelashes on her eyes and a hooped earring.

If the hinge is still squeaky, remove it completely from the door and slide out the hinge pin.
Use long pliers to move the pin clockwise and counterclockwise to remove it.
Give the hinge pin a good rub with wire wool.
Replace the scrubbed hinge pin back on the door.
Try soap if the wire wool isn't to your liking.
Test your oiling.
Use a rag or paper towel to clean up.
If the worst comes to the worst and you can't get rid of the squeak, chuck the hinge out and pop down to your local hardware store to find a good replacement.

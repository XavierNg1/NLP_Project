Understand that money does not come free--unless you win the lottery--and that you will have to work for it.
Never pay for job or investment opportunities.
Steer clear of getting paid without having to work for it.
Avoid scams like the magic diet pill and any other diet program that promises that you will lose weight in a day.
Ignore promises of free stuff if it's more than a diaper sample.

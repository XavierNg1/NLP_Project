Choose 2 complementary scraps of fabric that you want to use.
Cut a piece of double-sided adhesive fabric or fusible interfacing.
Place the interfacing on the backside of your primary envelope fabric, so that there is 1/4 (0.6 cm) of room on each side.
Place the lining fabric over the interfacing.
Use a sewing machine to stitch around the outside of your envelope to secure the fabric and interface.
Clip the very ends of 3 sides of the square, so that the ends are square.
Fold the fabric at the 2-inch (5 cm) corner inside, approximately 1/4-inch (0.6 cm), to create a hem.
Stitch around the entire envelope again at 1/8 inch (0.3 cm).
Fold the backside of your envelope into a 3 way fold.
Pin the edges in place where the 3 sides meet.
Take brightly colored thread or embroidery floss and hand sew the 2 inside fold edges.
Fold the top down and iron into place to close the envelope.

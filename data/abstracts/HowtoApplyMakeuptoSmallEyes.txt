Make sure that your eyebrows are trimmed and plucked.
First, prime your eyes so your makeup will last as long as possible, This can be done by patting a primer onto your lids and up to your eyebrow.
The next step is choosing the color of your eyeliner.
To apply the eyeliner, start at the inside corner of your upper lid and feather the eyeliner towards the outer corner, using short strokes to avoid a thick, solid line.
Another trick is to put on shimmery (not glittery!),
Using a curler, curl your eyelashes before you finish with mascara.
When applying mascara to your bottom lashes, always remember this: Less is more!

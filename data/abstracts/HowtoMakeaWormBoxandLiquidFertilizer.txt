Obtain a large sturdy ice chest.
Angle it down so that water will drain out the hole.
Worms can be obtained as bait or online.
Get some lawn clippings, newspapers shreds, leaves etc.
Obtain a mister, a 1 gallon (3.8Â L) per hour or less.
Mount the mister above the ice chest and turn it on.
Obtain a small cheap sump pump with a float switch ( try to buy one on craigslist for 10 bucks), maybe $50 new.
By the time the water gets to the plants it's lost some or all of it's chlorine and picked up lots of micro nutrients and micro biotic life which is good for plants.
Keep putting dirty salad in the ice chest, fill it up.

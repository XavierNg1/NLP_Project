Purchase a nut mill, spice grinder or nutmeg grinder from a kitchen retailer.
Buy fresh whole nutmeg.
Crack the nutmeg shell off by pressing a plate or knife turned sideways on the nut while it is on the cutting board.
Open the nut mill.
Pick up the mill and place it on the surface where you want your grated nutmeg to fall.
Turn the crank until you have enough nutmeg to use in your recipe.
Keep the nutmeg inside the mill.

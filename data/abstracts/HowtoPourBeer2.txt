Select a clean beer glass, usually a pint glass.
Clear the tap line of excess pressure or old beer.
Position the beer glass a few inches (several cm) under the tap at a 45-degree angle.
Turn the tap all the way on so that beer flows quickly and steadily down the side of the glass.
Level the beer glass slowly as it fills so that a layer of head about an inch and a half deep (about 4 cm) develops on the surface.
Wait a few seconds for the head to settle on the top of the beer before drinking.

Choose a t-shirt you won't mind cutting up, and turn it inside out.
Cut the sleeves off.
Cut the neckline off.
Decide on the length of your bag, then draw a horizontal line across the shirt.
Draw a series of vertical lines, Â¾ to 1 inch (1.91 to 2.54 centimeters) across the bottom of the shirt.The lines need to go from the hem of the shirt, all the way up to the horizontal line you drew.
Cut the vertical lines to make the fringe.
Turn the shirt right side out, then tie the top fringes to the corresponding bottom fringes.
Tie the adjacent fringes together to hide the gaps.
Consider cutting the shoulders of the shirt and then sewing them together to make front any back handles.

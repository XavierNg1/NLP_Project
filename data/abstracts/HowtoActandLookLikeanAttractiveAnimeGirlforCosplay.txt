Choose a recognizable character.
Know your character.
Plan some poses.
Ignore negative attention.Unfortunately, for all of the great things conventions can offer, they are also notorious for attracting haters and creeps.
Be confident.
Look online for inspiration.
Design a costume.
Wear a skirt.
Aim for colourful boots.Because anime is usually so stylized, characters' shoes tend to be bright and bold.
Modify a pattern or existing garment.
Use a plain or natural fabric.
Make your costume distinctive.In a lot of cases, people are only going to have a few seconds to admire your costume before their gaze turns elsewhere.
Enlarge your eyes.
Try wearing contact lenses.
Rose your cheeks.
Straighten and bang your hair.There is no single "anime haircut" for girls.
Get into the community.
Choose a convention.The idea of going to conventions can be daunting if you haven't made a habit of going already.
Consider going in a group.
Decide whether you want your photo taken.Some people go to cosplay conventions purely with the interest of checking out other peoples cosplays.
Warm up.
Have fun!

Take a regular deck of playing cards (minus the jokers) and shuffle thoroughly.
Begin the game.
If the card played has a number on it, the person two spaces to the left of the dealer puts down a card, too.
When a letter card is played, the next person in the sequence must play another letter card in order for play to continue.
The only thing that overrides the letter card rule is the slap rule.
Players should abide by the slap rule in the following situations:



Double: when two cards of equivalent value are laid down consecutively.
You must add one or two cards to the bottom of the pile if you slap the pile and it was not slap-able.
Continue playing even if you have run out of cards.

Attend any classical music concerts.
Watch how they move in the flow, how they lose themselves in the music, how they sweat, wave, how they become one with the music.
Appreciate the solo artist.
One wonderful thing about classical music is that it encompasses all feelings: confusion, love, happiness, rage, sorrow, guilt, etc.

Make yourself responsible for all present and future well-being of your child from the day he/she is born and do it with a glad heart.
You do not necessarily have to fulfill each and every whim of the child.
Be consistently and constantly committed to the present and future well-being of your child.
Show and receive trust.
Be a guide not a best friend.
Feel free to make positive inferences from all of the above.

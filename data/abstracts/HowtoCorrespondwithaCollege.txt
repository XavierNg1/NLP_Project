Do not be too casual in your communication.
Do not be afraid to build a rapport with the professors or admin staff that you communicate with, but keep your casual attitude on a tight leash.
It shouldnâ€™t have to be said, but here it is, you should not use text-talk on any of your written communications, and slang of any sort should be avoided unless the people you are communicating with use it first.

,
Learn the names of the people you are communicating with.
Check the website and any printed paraphernalia to get all the information you think you need for your written and phone conversations.
Address your written messages to a named person unless seriously cannot, in which case address them to the department they are heading for.
Practice your phone conversation before making the call if you are at all nervous.
If they want all enquiries via email then send an email.
Give them more than one way of getting back in touch with you.
If you turn up for an interview then tone down the perfume or aftershave, and light makeup is sufficient.
Read the literature they give you because there is nothing worse than asking staff members questions that are answered in the college prospectus.
Spell-check your written communications but read it through for typos too as they will not appear on your spell check.

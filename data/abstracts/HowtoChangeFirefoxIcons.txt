First things first, you'll need a program called Resource Hacker, which you can download for free from http://www.users.on.net/%7Ejohnson/resourcehacker/.
Next, you'll need an icon file to change the default image to.
Locate that XPI file with WinRAR and extract it to it's own folder.
Click on 'Open File with New Icon' and find that Main-Window.ico file.
But, *Gasp!

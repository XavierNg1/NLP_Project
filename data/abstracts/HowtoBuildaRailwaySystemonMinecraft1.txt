Make an inventory with items you only need.
Create a (real life) map.
According to your real life map, start building.
When building the station, don't dig directly down.
Don't make it too deep.
When you finished digging till your point where it isn't too deep, create an area cleared up.
Build your space for your train tracks.
Don't start putting the tracks down yet!,
Add signs that show the direction of where the station platforms/concourses are.
Add information based on your real-life map.
Put staircases on your stairs that lead up to the exits.

,
You could change the colour of your station, not just some boring cobblestone colour.
Put a chest that contains Minecarts so you could get them easily (consider using ender chests since it saves you the trouble of running around replacing mine carts later).
After you decorated your first station, start building your railway.
Use your player Minecraft map to help yourself guide you where your next station is going to be.
Repeat these steps until you finished your first line.
For interchanging stations with different railway lines, you have to put a note for information about it too.

,
If any of your lines go through the sea, make sure you dig deep enough for your railway tracks to not get flooded.

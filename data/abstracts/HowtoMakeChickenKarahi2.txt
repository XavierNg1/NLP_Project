Add a diced onion before the garlic and ginger, cooking for 2-3 minutes, for a Northern Indian version.
Chop a green bell pepper into 1/2" cubes and add with the tomatoes.
Puree the tomatoes in a blender if you don't want any chunks.
Add 1/2 cup cream or cashew milk for a richer, slightly less spicy sauce.
Substitute lamb or beef for chicken to get an entirely new dish without a new recipe.
Finished.

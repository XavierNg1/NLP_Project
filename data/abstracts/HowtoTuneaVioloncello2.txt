Find the turning pegs.
Make sure you have the cello in a place where you have a hand easily free, two if you don't have much hand strength.
Take the peg firmly in your hand and turn it either up if it's too low or down if it's too high.
Making sure you don't let go, use a lot of strength to push the peg back in.

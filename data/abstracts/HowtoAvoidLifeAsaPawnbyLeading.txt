Avoid the distorted thought of following: do not use another person's goals and ambitions.
Lead to help realize your dreams by pursuing them.
Decide to explore new opportunities and your possibilities.
Develop leadership skills, by valuing and supporting individual life and actions as personal opportunities.
Seek freedom defined as:


Freed "to" act (and not freed "from" actions), example: "have freedom to believe in and seek your goals";
Freed "for" a cause (and not freed "of" responsibility), example: "use freedom and make the effort to create your success or failure, by trying, striving for your goals such as betterment for you and others";
Seek your own individual vision that fits your ambition and your own industriousness, example: "Take hold of freedom to decide with the freedom of choosing your own way.",
Be competitive in personal and group efforts for success versus mediocrity as your decision without being condemned or restricted.
Get education and training: Support your dream for your way of life.
Consider promoting or criticizing political officials, candidates or parties, if you wish.
Cooperate to help fulfill others pursuits as well as help your own: but do not be neutral or compromising your opportunities.
Work individually beyond group boundaries which are necessary as long as there are differences among individuals who will set some borders and bounds to protect one's personal prerogatives to freedom.

Make your own life's career, and live firsthand not vicariously.
Expect different ideals and differing results for different folks, so seek what you prefer to be, not what an aptitude test or counselor reveals or indicates.

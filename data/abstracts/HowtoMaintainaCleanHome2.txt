Never go to bed with a dirty kitchen.
Clean out your sink.
Spray a kitchen cleaner on the stove top, tabletops, and counters.
Inspect the kitchen floor for any spots or spills, and use the same cloth you used on the counter to wipe them up.
Sweep the floor with a broom quickly if necessary.
Set rules in your house to require everyone to pitch in.

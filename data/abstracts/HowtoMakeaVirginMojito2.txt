Muddle the mint leaves, 1 teaspoon sugar, and simple syrup in a tall, sturdy glass.
Juice one large or medium-sized lime to get 1 oz.
Add the fresh lime juice to the glass with your mint and sweeteners.
Fill your glass with ice, if not to the top than at least 3/4 full.
Fill the glass the rest of the way with club soda.

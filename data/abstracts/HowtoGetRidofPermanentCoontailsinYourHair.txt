Buy a high-quality bleach that can get rid of the darkest color in your coontails.
Prepare half of the bleach and set the rest aside.
Separate the coontail from the rest of your hair.
Comb on the bleach with a plastic comb.
Leave the bleach sit for thirty to forty minutes or until all of the coontail is pale blonde.

,
Rinse the bleach out.
Wait for your hair to dry and determine if there is still some color showing.
Decide if you are getting new coontails or are going back to your natural color.
Find a hair dye one shade lighter or darker than the color of your hair.
Follow the instructions on the box to prepare the dye.

,
Dye only the bleached out former coontail.
Prepare and use the second box of dye on your whole head.
Congratulations!

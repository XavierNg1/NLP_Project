Keep your body slumped downward.
Gaze at nothing in particular.
Keep your eyelids lowered or closed.
Furrow your brow.
Frown.
Pout your lips.
Touch your face.
Cry.
Have an objective.
Sigh.
Act like you are not hungry.
Tell others you are tired and weak.
Pretend to have lost interest in things.
Act absent minded.
Spend lots of time alone.

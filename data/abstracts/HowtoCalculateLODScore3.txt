Establish a pedigree for two loci of interest.
Determine the number of recombinant and number of nonrecombinants.
Calculate the probability of obtaining the results assuming the two loci are linked.
Calculate the probability of obtaining the results assuming the two loci are not linked.
Divide the probability of obtaining the results assuming the two loci are linked (from Step 3 above), by the probability of obtaining the results assuming the two loci are not linked (from Step 4 above).
Take the base 10 logarithm of the ratio obtained above (Step 5).

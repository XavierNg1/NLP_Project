Start with something small, like a Guitar Hero controller or a ukulele, before jumping into anything serious.
Wear a hooded sweatshirt.
Check the height of the strap, make sure it's not too high and restricting, or low and loose.
Move on from your toy guitar to something a little more serious.
Know that now that you can seriously smash windows and such, it's time to reinforce that non-locking strap.
Test your technique with an electric guitar of little value.
Feel free to try this with a more valuable guitar when you have the technique mastered, but never try it on your most important guitar.

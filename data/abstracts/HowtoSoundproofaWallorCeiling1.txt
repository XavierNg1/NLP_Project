Install the basic frame and one side of the wall, leaving the wood studs exposed.
Use putty pads, often sold as "fire stoppers" to seal up electrical outlets or boxes.
Blast the exposed wall with damp-blown cellulose, a recycled insulation and sound proofing material.
Press the cellulose down flat before it dries.
Seal up the wall with the first layer of sheetrock.
Use green-glue sealant to cover up all the edges on the sealant.
Apply soundproofing compound to the back of your drywall sheet in a zig-zag pattern.
Install the second layer of drywall (backed by the glue) like normal.
Continue with construction like normal, as sound-proofed walls are no different than any other.

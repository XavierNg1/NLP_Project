Start by drawing two parallel lines (with a distance between them) and a dot.
Connect the following:

The tops of S and L with an inwards curve.
From the top of S, draw a horizontal line to the right until it touches the curve.
Draw the paddles from the middle of the curve, and fill in your drawing with color.

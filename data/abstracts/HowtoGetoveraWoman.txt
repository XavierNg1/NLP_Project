Stop all contact with the woman.
Don't set yourself up for further emotional distress by rebounding into another relationship.
Lament your loss, and then get over it.
Turn your attention to yourself, and you will survive a breakup.
Avoid the activities that you and your girlfriend did together, unless they are undertakings you did before meeting her, or they are activities you really enjoy.
Review your current life and lifestyle, and ask yourself if you are on the path you intend to be on.
Focus on those who still love you, like your family and friends.

Open up your image using your chosen software.
Find your clone tool icon.
Choose a brush.
On your image, locate your brush.
Hold down the CTRL key and click the area that you want to clone.
Try for the larger areas first.
Watch for distinctive items in your scenery that you need to take into consideration, like tree trunks.
Once you feel like you have the basic items cloned out, zoom in closer to your image.
Increase the size of the brush, if possible, and work on cloning out the remnants.
Once you feel you are done with getting the remnants out, zoom back out so that you can see the full image.
Switch to a larger brush (when possible) and possibly even increase the amount of diffusion of your brush.

Continue until you have your desired image.

Remember that the whole surfer look is one of carefree casualness.
Try to get surfer girl hair.
Get a tan.
Sort out your wardrobe.
Wear jewellery such as bracelets made of hemp, rope, string and seashells, and necklaces made of the same materials or rock pendants.
Paint your toenails a bright color so your feet look nice - remember they'll be bare on the beach.

Get regular screenings.
See your doctor for a Pap test.A Pap test is recommended three years after the onset of sexual activity, or beginning at age 21 (whichever comes first).
Prepare properly for a Pap test.If you are planning to see your doctor for a Pap test within the next two days, it is important to avoid the following:


Sexual intercourse
Douching your vagina
Tampon insertion
Using any birth control foams or jellies
Inserting any creams or medications into your vagina
Being on your period.
Consider HPV testing.In addition to the usual Pap test, you can ask your doctor to test you for the presence of the HPV virus at the same time.
Recognize the risk factors for cervical cancer.Understanding what increases your chances of developing cervical cancer can help you to cut back and to adopt safer behaviors.
Get vaccinated.There are two HPV vaccines available, Gardasil and Cervarix, that are recommended for girls around the age of 12.
Quit smoking.Smoking has been linked to a heightened risk of cervical cancer (and of cancers elsewhere in the body, too).
Practice safe sex.Because cervical cancer is linked to HPV, a sexually transmitted infection, practicing safe sex and using condoms during sex can decrease your risk.
Understand the importance of screening tests and early diagnosis.Cervical cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in women; however, if you follow through with regular screening tests as directed by your doctor, you can diminish your risk of contracting cervical cancer to almost zero.
Follow through with further investigations as needed.If your Pap test reveals suspicious cells or a worrisome lesion, your doctor will advise you on a course of action to follow up on the cause for concern.
Be aware of concerning symptoms.

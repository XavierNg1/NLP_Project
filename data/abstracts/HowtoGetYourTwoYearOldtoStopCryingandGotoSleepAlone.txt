Avoid the “Cry-it-Out” technique.
Make sure your toddler engages in plenty of physical activity during the day.
Be careful not to provide too much physical activity, which can overstimulate your toddler.
Refrain from allowing your toddler to sit and watch television for too long.
Take your toddler’s activity level down a notch during the late afternoon and early evening hours.
Try to stick with the same routine before bed every night.
Do whatever works for you, your child and your schedule.
Keep the bedtime routine simple.
Stay within your toddler’s sight when he is adjusting to his new bedtime routine.
Let your toddler make decisions each night as part of his bedtime routine.
Give your child other, limited options for going to bed, such as “Do you want to go to bed now or in 10 minutes?”.
Avoid giving in to your toddler’s cries and pleads to postpone bedtime.
Remain calm at all times.
Ignore temper tantrums and crying fits.

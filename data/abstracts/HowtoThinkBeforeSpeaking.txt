Observe yourself: Take note of the circumstances when what you say is not what you, upon reflection, would have wanted to say.
Recognize your situation: After you determine what circumstances might be most likely to produce this unwanted effect, try to be very observant about when those conditions appear to be manifesting.
Observe the conversation.
Observe the people: Who is speaking and how do they communicate?,
Formulate responses: Not just one, but consider your options.
Consider the information: Is what you want to say Effective, Necessary, Accurate, Timely, and Appropriate (ENATA)?,
Gauge the reaction: Is the information you’re going to present formulated in a way to make a positive impact?,
Be thoughtful about your tone: How you say it is, in many ways, as important as what you say.
Communicate: You now know what you’ll say, why it’s ENATA, how you’ll say it and the most likely reaction.
Observe yourself again: While you’re talking, consider what you’re saying and keep a close watch on the reactions as they emerge.

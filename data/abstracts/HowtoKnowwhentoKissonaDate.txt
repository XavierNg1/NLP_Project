Stare at the person's mouth.
Touch them gently.
See if they touch you back.
Compliment the person.
Watch their body language.
Wait until the end.
Pick somewhere private, but not too private.
Watch for the linger.
Look the person in the eye.
Lean in closer.
Ask if you can kiss them.
Move in for the kiss.
Remember rejection may not be about you.

Create a new folder on your desktop or in some other easy-to-reach location.
Open up the downloaded .dmg images as if you were going to install their applications.
Once all of the applications are "installed" into your temp folder, open Apple's Disk Utility (/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility).
In the Disk Utility menu bar, click on File -> New -> Disk Image from Folder.
Give the image to be created a name (MyUtils or MacRestore, for instance) and save it in the same place you created the step 2 folder.
To make graphical/display changes, double click the image you just created and open the drive your computer just mounted.

Design your background in any image manipulation program (Adobe Illustrator is excellent for this sort of job).
Hide the background image.
Re-size the mounted driver's finder window and move the icons to where you'd like them to remain.

Finalize (compress) the image.

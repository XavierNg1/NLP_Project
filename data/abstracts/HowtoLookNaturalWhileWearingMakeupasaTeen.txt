Take care of your skin.
Use concealer to hide dark circles under your eyes.
Find a matte eyeshadow (No sparkles or bright colours) that is either a bit darker or a bit lighter than your natural skin tone.
Take an eyeliner pencil and lightly draw a line from the outer corner of your eye (near your temple) 3/4 of the way across your eye.
Curl your eyelashes with an eyelash curler, then apply brownish-black or black mascara to your top lashes only.
Apply a light pink or peach blush to the apples of your cheeks.
Apply your favourite lipgloss.
Finished.

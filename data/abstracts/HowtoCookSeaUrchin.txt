Locate a fishmonger or store that sells live sea urchin.
Cut a round opening in the top of the sea urchin using small, pointed scissors.
Scoop out the "tongues" of the sea urchin with a small spoon.
Preheat the grill, and brush the bread with the rest of the olive oil.
Add the sea urchin to the top of the slices and serve.

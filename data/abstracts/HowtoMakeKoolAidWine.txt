Assemble your equipment and ingredients for bottling.
Disinfect the equipment that will be used in the bottling process, including the bottles, funnel, and rubber hose, in a large pot of boiling water for at least three minutes.
Boil the water to kill any form of bacteria.
Activate the yeast.
Use a clean funnel to fill the jug or bottles with the cooled sugar water.
When you can see that the yeast has been activated (getting foamy) use the funnel to pour it into the bottle.
Find a safe location where youâ€™ll be able to store the bottle upright, such as inside a bathroom cabinet, in a basement, or behind a desk.
When you can see that the balloon isn't full of gas anymore, the fermentation is over.
Separate the dead yeast.
Add the two packages of Kool Aid powder to the wine in the new bottle, cap the bottle, then shake it for a few seconds to mix it thoroughly.
After the third week has passed, siphon it again except into small water bottles.
When the wine is around 4 weeks old or older, it should be ready for consumption.

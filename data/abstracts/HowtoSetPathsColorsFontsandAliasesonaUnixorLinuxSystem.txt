Remember that Unix and Linux are case sensitive to settings and commands.
Learn to use emacs or vi, preferably both.
Set Up Paths -- A "path" is the directories the computer will look in to find a command (or program) you wish to run.
Modify the ".Xdefaults" file, in order to change your default fonts and colors.
Create Aliases -- Aliases in Unix are commands that substitute for other commands.

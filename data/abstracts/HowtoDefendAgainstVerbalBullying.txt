Treat verbal bullying like war.
Know the bully's game.
The art of war is simply to deny the bullies what they want.
Avoid trouble.
Your physical orientation to the bully is important.
If you find yourself being bullied at a bad time and place, then you still have options.
Don't look upset.
Don't play the bully's game.
The bully wants you to be his opponent in the game and face him directly.
Your body language is crucial.
Specifically, use the "big six" tactics of 1) ignoring; 2) dismissing; 3) misunderstanding; 4) agreeing; 5) ribbing; and 6) reflecting.
Adapt.
If all else fails, be gone or be strong.
Remember that you will always have the moral high ground.

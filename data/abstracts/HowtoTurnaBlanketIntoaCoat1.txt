Find a fleece or wool-felt blanket.
Fold the blanket in half widthwise.
Draw a vertical line down the center-front of your folded blanket, from the folded edge all the way down to the bottom.
Cut along the line that you drew.
Cut a half-circle along the top fold to make an opening for your neck.
Try the coat on, and place a sewing pin where your waist is on the center of each front flaps.
Check the sleeve lengths.
Take the coat off, then cut a short slit on each flap, using the sewing pens as a guide.
Shorten the sleeves, if needed.
Wear the coat.

Cut your bread into Â¾-inch (1.91-centimeter) cubes.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium to high heat.
Add the bread pieces into the skillet, then give them a stir so that they get evenly coated with the melted butter.
Sprinkle the bread with some dried herbs, if desired.
Let the bread cook until it turns brown.
Give the bread a stir, and cook it for 10 minutes more, stirring often.
Remove croutons from the skillet.
Use the croutons in your recipe, or store them.

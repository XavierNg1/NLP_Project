Sarcasm is key.
Be good at what you do and do it to the best of your ability.
Have a sensitive side.
Call people by nicknames.
Stick to your principles.
When angry or annoyed (or in any other negative state of mind) make sure to quickly touch your nose, usually with a quick thumb slap on the tip.

,
After finishing an angry rant make sure to nudge them with your shoulder as you walk away.
Learn how to change the pitch of your voice.
If someone is annoying you, start closing your hand into a fist, then opening it, the closing it repeatedly as a "warning light".

,
If,for any reason, you should find yourself speechless or otherwise unable to properly respond sarcastically, act like you weren't paying attention.
If possible, prolong appropriate words during rants.

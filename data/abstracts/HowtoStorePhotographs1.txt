Make sure you have some kind of back-up (e.g. negatives, photocopy) before storing your photos.
Store your photographs at low temperatures and low humidity.
Find a cool, dry room in your house to put the pictures in that doesn’t get a lot of light and doesn’t fluctuate a lot in temperature or humidity.
Don’t store photographs with newspaper clippings, as the acid in the paper will damage them.

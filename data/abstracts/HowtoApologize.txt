Give up the idea of being “right.” Arguing about the details of an experience that involves more than one person is usually frustrating, because experience is highly subjective.
Use “I”-statements.
Avoid justifying your actions.
Use excuses cautiously.
Avoid the “but.” An apology that includes the word “but” will almost never be understood as an apology.This is because “but” is what’s known as a “verbal eraser.” it shifts the focus from what should be the point of the apology -- acknowledging responsibility and expressing regret -- to justifying yourself.
Consider the other person’s needs and personality.
Write your apology down, if you like.
Find the right time.
Do it in person.
Choose a quiet or private setting for the apology.
Make sure you have enough time to have a complete conversation.
Be open and non-threatening.
Use open, humble body language.
State your regret.
Accept responsibility.
State how you will remedy the situation.
Listen to the other person.
End with gratitude.
Be patient.
Stick to your word.

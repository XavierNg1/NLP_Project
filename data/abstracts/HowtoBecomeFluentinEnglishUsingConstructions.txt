You should strive for fluency, in any phrases and sentences you are learning, right from the start.
Any time you learn a new word or expression, you should quickly create a construction that features it.
Use construction branching.
Create your own iterations and branches (with two related targets filled-in) from any desired core construction, forcing yourself to make it a part of your vocabulary.

Consider diagnosis with new-onset or long standing type 2 diabetes as a good reason to prospectively combine three tests for biomarkers that are used for indicating pancreatic cancer -- CA 19-9, and newer tests microRNA-196, and microRNA-200.
Watch for jaundice.
Take notice of a sore abdomen.
Be alert to fatigue and weakness.

Watch for burning abdominal pain.
Take note of severe nausea and vomiting.
Beware of unexpected weight loss.
Get all the appropriate blood tests.

Watch for subtle and nonspecific signs and symptoms: These may indicate pancreatic cancer, or some other ailment.
Beware that in later stages there may be:

Chronic pain
Severe nausea
Frequent vomiting
Malabsorption of food
Blood glucose control problems/Diabetes (since the pancreas makes and releases insulin but becomes dysfunctional).

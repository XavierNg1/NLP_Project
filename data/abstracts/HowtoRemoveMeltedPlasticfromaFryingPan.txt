Place the frying pan with the melted plastic in a freezer.
Meanwhile, find a non-marring object like a piece of wood, plastic mallet etc.
Remove the super-cooled frying pan from the freezer.
Place the frying pan on a flat surface, with the bottom side turned up.
Using the striking tool, gently tap the bottom of the frying pan in the area where the plastic is pooled.
If this fails, repeat step 5, but not quite as gently.

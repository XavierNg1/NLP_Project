Don't be afraid to get to know boys or girls.
Don't rush out to find a boyfriend or girlfriend just because your friends have one.
Don't stress out about getting the shift/ meeting someone/having your first kiss.
How to decide if you should go out with someone:


Try to find someone you think is cute, inside and out.
Remember that it's okay if you're not interested in boys or girls right now.

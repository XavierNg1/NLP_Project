Know when to use your handshake.
Be the first to extend your hand.
Extend your right hand straight before the handshake.
Take the other person's hand in a firm but not rock-hard clasp.
Keep your hand perpendicular to the ground.
Shake up and down no more that two or three times, and avoid excessive pumping/shaking as it becomes annoying and distracting.
When giving the handshake, make eye contact and state your usual greetings.

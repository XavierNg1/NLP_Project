Bring out the sheet music, study it closely.
Decide to learn two or three bars at a time, depending on how difficult it is.
Play the RIGHT hand part, while looking at the sheet music.
Now turn away the sheet music, and play the very same part again.
Repeat step 3 and 4 for the LEFT hand, and repeat the very same steps for BOTH hands together.

Apply this for the rest of the piece, up to five bars at a time (Go easy!),
For perfecting the passages between bars, do like so.
Now try to get the entire piece done, first while looking at the sheet music and get it right 4 times with, and then 4 times without after turning the sheet music away.

,Now that you know the actual notes you need to play and the keys you need to press, work on the emotion of the piece!

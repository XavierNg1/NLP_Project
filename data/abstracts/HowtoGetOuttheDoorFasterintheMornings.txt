Review your schedule for the following day.
Pick out your clothes before bed.
Pack lunches, backpacks, diaper bags, and briefcases the night before to avoid the "morning rush".
If you drink coffee, have the coffee machine prepared.
Coordinate wake up times and bathroom schedules of the people you live with.
Have a lineup of several routine breakfasts.
If you tend to linger too long when you read the newspaper or take a shower, set a timer.
Keep your cell phone on the charger, in an easy to grab location.
Plan to get up a little earlier if you need to do some dishes, throw a load of clothes in the washer/dryer, pay a few bills, or walk the dog.

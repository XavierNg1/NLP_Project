Get a can that is large, both somewhat tall and wide.
Decide whether you want your stove to have a bottom, a top, both, or neither (being essentially a ring with some holes around the top and bottom).
Peel any labels off of the can and wash it well.
Cut the fuel door/bottom vent, a rectangular hole in the side at the bottom, with about one-fourth of the height and one-sixth of the circumference of the can.
Make the smoke vents.
For a stove without a top, you may want to install some kind of support for a cooking vessel (a small one, such as a can slightly smaller than the stove) so that it can sit above the fire but slightly inside the rim for stability.
To use your stove, build a fire inside the stove (or, if it has no bottom, on the dirt under the stove) using matches and tinder.
To grill something on a stove with a top, test its heat first by throwing droplets of water onto the top.
To boil something on a stove without a top, put a vessel on top of the stove.
The heat can be high and uneven.

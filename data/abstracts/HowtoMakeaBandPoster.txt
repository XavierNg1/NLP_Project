Firstly you're going to need to find out what bands are playing, where they are playing, the time the gig starts, the cost of entry, and whether it is an all-ages gig, or over 18's only.
Write all this information down, making sure you have the headlining band first, the band after them, and after them etc.
Plan your poster layout, you will need the name of the gig or just put "Live Music, featuring:" at the very top.
Have the list of bands at the top of the poster after the name of the gig, use different but readable fonts for each band, try to reflect the genre of the band in the font you use.
Underneath the bands you should have the location of the gig, both the venue name AND the town/city it's in.

,
Announce when the doors open.
Relate the cost of entry.
Lastly you can put a link to your My Space/Bebo/Blogger etc.
Choose an image As for a logo/graphic, simple things like a star, skull, flame etc.Take a look at the sample poster below for ideas (obviously don't include a watermark on your poster)

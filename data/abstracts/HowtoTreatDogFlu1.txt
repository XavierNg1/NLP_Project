Understand that there is no medical "cure" for canine influenza.Rather, your dog's veterinarian will offer what is called "supportive care.",
Give your dog fluids.The vet may offer your dog extra fluids, sometimes via an IV, if your dog has become dehydrated as a result of fighting off canine influenza.
Encourage your dog to eat.
Ask about medications for symptom management.While it is never wise to try and give your dog human medications (such as Tylenol, Advil, or other cold and flu medications), your vet can advise you as to pet-friendly alternatives that can help to decrease the bothersome symptoms for your dog, as his or her immune system works to fight off the virus.

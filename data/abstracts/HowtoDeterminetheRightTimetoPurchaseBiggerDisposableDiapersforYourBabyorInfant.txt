Look at your baby's diapers carefully.
Ask yourself "Is the baby in pain?",
Go over to your child, and see how many fingers you can comfortably fit into the containment area of the child's diaper, assuming it hasn't been too fully soaked in urine yet.

,
Release the child's diaper-tapes just a little bit.
Take note of how much urine the diaper has absorbed.
Look for rashes on the child's waistline that could be caused from the diapers being too small.
Look for an un-snug fit on the baby with their diaper's leak guards.
Buy bigger disposable diapers if the diaper tapes can't be readjusted any closer than the edge of the diaper itself.

Once you have decided on a style that suits you, go out and shop for the basics.

If you are shopping on a budget, a great place to look for these basics and accessories is local thrift stores.
Once you have your basics and accessories down, pick up a few higher priced goth boutique items.
The final touch to a goth outfit is goth beauty.

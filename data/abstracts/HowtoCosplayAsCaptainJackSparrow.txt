Imagine yourself as a legendary figure.
There are notable risks in taking this lifestyle as it is very possible you may end up a down-and-out, rather like Jack Sparrow in the beginning of The Curse of the Black Pearl.
Always think ahead.
Be persuasive.
Never give away what side you're on.
Talk like an Englishman.
Flirt.
Walk in a slightly unbalanced manner.

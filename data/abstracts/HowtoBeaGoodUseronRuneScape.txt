Know that if you are a good user on Runescape you will gain a lot of respect from other players and you may even be chosen to become a moderator (if you're lucky!),
Never call anybody a Noob.
Help people if and when you can.
Do not scam people!,
Know that if you get in an argument with someone and they get quite aggressive, simply add them to your Ignore List or move to a different world.
Remember that if you are planning to report somebody for a particular reason, after you've done it, don't shout out "REPORTED!",
Be wary with the words you use as a lot can be misinterpreted for swearing and will be blocked out by the star filter.
Do not brag about your own items, money or quest points or anything else related - this will only make people look down on you, and it might even cause hackers or scammers to want to claim your account.

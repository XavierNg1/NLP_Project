Open the Tinder App.
Open your messages with the person who you’d like to block.
Tap the "more" button in the top right corner, then tap “Unmatch.” The "more" button looks like three vertical dots arranged in a stoplight pattern.
Only Unmatch if you never want to hear from this person again.
Consider using the "Report" option for more serious problems.

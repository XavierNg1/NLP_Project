Be really comfortable on a BMX.
Adjust the flip for a nice landing, but for starters get a good 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m) of air.
To give you an idea of how you want to pull off the ramp, picture you are on a roller coaster going through a loop.
Try taking a few practice runs, going as fast as you're planning on going for the real one.
As you approach the ramp, pump into it, pushing forward into it, going with the transition as if you were trying to pick up speed.
Now you're off the lip, flipping upside down.
If you go completely around on the rotation and you see the ground, it will happen faster than you can think, but just land.
Now if you went too slow, or didn't commit to the flip enough and you under rotated... good luck, odds are your front wheel is going to land first and anything from having sore wrists from the front impact, to landing in a tangled heap on your bike can happen.

Next try pumping harder into the ramp going off the lip, this will speed up your rotation and get you over rotating, or landing on your wheels.

,
Wear pads, all of them, every time you ride your bike.

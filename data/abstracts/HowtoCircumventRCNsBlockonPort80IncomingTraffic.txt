Set up your home web server on a port other than port 80.
In your router's configuration, forward the port your server is running on to the IP of the machine it is running on.
Find your network's external IP address:Â http://www.whatismyip.com/

,Verify that your server is reachable outside the network by accessing the external IP address with the port you chose.
Setup a reverse proxy server outside your network that sends traffic to the port you forwarded on your external IP.
Test your reverse proxy.

Fill the small pot with enough water to submerge the potato and bring to a boil.
While the potato is cooking, grab a chopping board and chop the peppers, zucchini, yellow squash, onions.
Chop the chicken.
Take the first sauté pan and pour a tablespoon of olive oil on it.
Remove the potato from the pot and let it cool down for a minute.
Preheat a second sauté pan and place a tablespoon of olive oil in it.
While the mix of potato and chicken are cooking, grab 3 eggs.

There are 4 main types of speakers in your car.
Adding tweeters to your current system would give the biggest improvement in your front sound stage.
High-mids front speakers, usually in your doors, provide the majority of the music you hear.
Mid-Low rear speakers are mostly there only for rear fill.
Low Subwoofer bass- A topic one in itself.
Amps - amps are only necessary when you think your sound level (volume) is too low even at max.

Create a lower line that comes out, then sharply turns up.
Add a line that protrudes from the bottom of the 'rainbow' and do the same a bit farther up and just below and behind the windscreen.
Make a small angled square below the main 'head.',
Make two lines that darken in the center protrude from the two points at the rear of the 'head.',
Add some armor patches to the center area of the last few lines that you made.

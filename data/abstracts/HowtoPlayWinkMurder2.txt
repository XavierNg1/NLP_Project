Gather a large group of people.
Sit in a circle.
Pick three murderers.
Make conversation.
Make eye contact and pay attention.
Don’t die!,
Say “I accuse!” If you’ve been paying close attention and you think you know who the murderer is (or murderers are), you raise your hand and say “I accuse!” A second person must “second” the accusation.

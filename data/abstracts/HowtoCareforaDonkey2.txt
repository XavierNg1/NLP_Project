Donkeys' main food sources should be low sugar and high fibre.
Donkeys need to eat little and often (like other equines) and don't do well if fed large amounts of food in one go ie.
Donkeys are happiest with plenty of space to roam around and graze, which they do for the majority of the day.
A great alternative to lush pasture is having a dirt paddock, or a non-grazing area, such as a concrete yard, or a sand school.
Give appropriate treats.
Donkeys are vegetarian and should never be fed anything derived from meat or fish.

Check with your vet about dietary supplements; these may be recommended depending on the soil type of your particular region.
Provide clean, fresh water.
Set up a dry shelter with hard floors.
If you chose to put a rug on your donkey for the winter (seriously cold weather, or an elderly/thin donkey) then make sure you take the rug off, check for rubs and replace every day.

Keep the feeding area clean.
Surround the area with a sturdy fence.

Practice at low sensitivity (2) when you are just starting.
When you can pretty much kill any player in 4 bursts (all direct hits), move up to sensitivity 3. you'll feel a bit uncomfortable with the speed, but you'll get used to it.
Go for the head, but the chest works fine too (except for BXR).

When up against a close range maniac, make sure to constantly monitor your radar.
Remember; rifles work well with grenades.

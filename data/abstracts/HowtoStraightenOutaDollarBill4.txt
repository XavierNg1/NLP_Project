Place the dollar bill into a water basin that is full of water.
Dribble a little bit of kitchen soap into the area where the bill is in the basin.
Use a bristle brush to gently rub the bill with the soapy water.
Turn the bill over when you have rubbed the bill's front side with the brush, and lay the back side of the bill face down in the same basin.
Remove the bill when both sides have been "cleaned".
Iron the bill out with an iron and ironing board.
Iron the opposite side of the bill out.

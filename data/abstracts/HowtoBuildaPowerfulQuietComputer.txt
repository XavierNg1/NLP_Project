Understand a few principles of computer coolingMoving parts get much noisier as they move a little faster.
Choose a case.The "tower" type is best because it can go under a desk, distancing the computer from the ears, while allowing the removable-disk drives to be reached easily and not consuming much floor space.
Choose a motherboard.Full ATX is best for a quiet PC because it lets expansion cards be spaced out for better cooling.
Choose a CPU cooler.This will generally be a heatsink with an attached fan, also known as a "HSF" or simply a "heatsink".
Choose fans.Slow-moving 120mm fans are best.
Mount and arrange fans.
Choose video cards.Look for something that has a dual-slot cooler (which has room for a much bigger, slower, quieter fan) and exhausts hot air out of the case directly.
Choose hard drives.
Choose a power supply.A power supply converts alternating current from the mains into direct current at various voltages your computer can use.

Recall the properties of an equilateral triangle.
Recall the Pythagorean Theorem.
Break the equilateral triangle in half, and assign values to variables a, b, and c. The hypotenuse c will be equal to the original side length.
Plug the values into the Pythagorean Theorem and solve for b2.
Find the square root of b2 to get the height of your triangle!

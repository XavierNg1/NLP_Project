Choosing your race should be your first step.
Like most fresh characters, you are going to spend the first 4-5 levels just completing missions to get you ready for the next zone.
Also, make sure you are keeping your training up on a level by level basis.
In the "second zone", you are going to have the opportunities to learn skills and professions for the first time.
At 10th level, you are given the missions to collect your first pet.
As you gain levels, so will your pet.
At upper levels, you gain the ability to set traps and even feign death to avoid mob attacks.
From here it is all about learning your craft and making the most out of your experience, so make the most of it and have fun.

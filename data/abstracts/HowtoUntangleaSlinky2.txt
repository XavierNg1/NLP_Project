Locate the ends of both Slinkies.
Take stock of the tangles.
Start with the tangles closest to the ends.
Hold the coils of one end in your hand.
Twist the coils into the untangled end.
Try to get all the tangles out of one Slinky first.
Work from the ends of the Slinkies to the middles.
Keep trying this approach so that you have fewer tangles to work with.

Take another look at the two Slinkies.
Untwist or untangle the two Slinkies carefully.

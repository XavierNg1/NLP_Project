Get the Kristen Stewart eyes.
Get the subtle lips.
Get the Kristen hair.
Don't overdo it.
Wear the flannel.
Wear a black hoodie or black leather jackets.
Wear the shirts.
Rock the knot.
Get the pants.
Rock the trucker hats.
Get the sunglasses.
Get the accessories.
Get the shoes.
Get fancy.
Don't smile if you don't feel like it.
Smile if you do feel like it.
Be okay with not being perfect.
Be cool with doing your own thing.

Obey the word (as the voice) of the Lord in the Gospel as found in The Bible.
Stop wishful thinking, but don't just start acting spiritual.
Be sure that you are born again.
Know this part of the point of life: to serve the Lord by also serving and loving your fellowman.
Focus on what serving your fellow man means as "whatever you do is being done to God.",
Pay attention to this point of life according to Jesus, as Jesus said:


"I say to you 'Love your enemy.
Seek to do the things that you know Christ did because Jesus said:


"The works (deeds) that I do -- you shall do also.",
Come out of complacency by serving others more than ever before.
Pray with others more.
Give thanks.
Allow God to soften the hardness of your heart to have compassion, and remove "cancer" (or call it "the rot") of sin by the grace and love of God.
Pay back time: Jesus said that if you have cheated anyone out of money: "Pay it back three fold, triple!",
Forgive: as God has forgiven us.
Cleanse your mind of doubt; put on the whole armor of God for service to the house of the Lord.
Meet the Truth of the Gospel halfway.
Seek to understand and live out that understanding through the Spirit.
Abandon the old way, if that was self-centered life, and see the matter in the whole context that stands waiting beyond the threshold of your hearts desires.
Engage the passion for the Truth of the Gospel.
For a new way of life you may do as Jesus said in the "Great Commission":"Go into all the world and preach the Gospel: teaching whatever you have heard of me."

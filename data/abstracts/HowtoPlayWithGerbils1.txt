Be patient.
Place their cage in a central area of your home or room.
Sit near your gerbils' cage and talk or sing to them.
Wash your hands.
Offer your gerbils a treat from your hand.
Place your hand out and let them jump into it.
Use both hands to “scoop” up your gerbil if you have to pick them up.

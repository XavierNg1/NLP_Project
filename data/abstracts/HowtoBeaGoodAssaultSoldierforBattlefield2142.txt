Practice with either the PAC Krylov or the EU SCAR.
Decide what you want to be: A heavy assault, a lightly-armed medic, or somewhere in between.
Try to go towards your path of medics or heavy assault by playing in ranked servers (a quick way to get your first unlock is to play in a heavily populated titan server and stay on the titan as an engineer to fix the titan guns).

,
Once you are either a medic or heavy assault, try to get the other "Sub-Class".
Practice - just keep practicing.

Cut your fabric into strips that are the width of your finished rug.
Pull the ends of the strips slightly to make them curl along their long edges.
Lay the slightly curled strips side by side with their ends even.
Machine stitch the strips together perpendicular to the lay of the strips.
Sew parallel lines, too.

Measure the width between your studs - most common is 16" on center; also measure the depth of the studs - most are 4" dimensional lumber, but if they're thicker you'll need deeper insulation to fill the void properly.
,Measure the size of the area you want to cover - width and height.
Go to a home improvement/building supply with your measurements to purchase the insulation needed.
There are different R-values of insulation (the higher the R value, the better it will insulate.),
If you are using fiberglass insulation, you'll need to wear gloves, eye protection, a face mask and long sleeved clothing.Paper-faced insulation should be inserted into the wall cavity with paper facing out.
Measure the length required to fill the cavity, with the insulation on the floor, and with the paper side facing up, cut though it with a utility knife.
Insert the insulation in the wall cavity.
Once you have your insulation complete, you'll need to cover it with a poly vapor barrier.
Attach the vapor barrier to the wood studs with a staple gun.
Once you have finished installing the insulation, remove all the clothing that you wore and wash it immediately.You can now proceed to cover the walls with drywall or paneling.

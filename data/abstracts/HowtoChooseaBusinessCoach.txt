Look closely at yourself to begin with.
Know your budget for the available time as well as your budget for financial investment.
Start to look for coaches that may align with who you are, or who you wish to be.
Invest 10 to 15 minutes on the coach's website.
Do an online "site search" on Google to see how many other web pages link to the coaching site.
Contact three to four coaches once you have narrowed down your list.
Look for something "a little extra" when selecting a business coach.
Ask the coach if they have ever sold a business.

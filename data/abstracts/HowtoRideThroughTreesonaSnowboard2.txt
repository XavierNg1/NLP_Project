Find an areaÂ on the mountain with a large amount of trees.
Figure out the best entrance to the area.
Enter the area and start carving through the trees using quick transitions between heel-side and toe-side.
Scan the spaces in between the trees while riding to determine your next turn.
Alternate between looking ahead at the terrain coming up beneath you as well as the trees ahead of you.
Be very cautious of cliffs.
Take a break to slow down and gather yourself if you are feeling lost or if you don't feel comfortable with the speed.
Get back on the lift and ride through the trees again!

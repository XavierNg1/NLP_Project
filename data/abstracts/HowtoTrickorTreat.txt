Purchase or make a costume.
Convince some friends to go with you.
Go to a door.
Say, "trick-or-treat" with a nice smile.
Say, "Thank you, happy Halloween!",
If they let you pick your candy, make sure it's a candy you like.
Go to next house and repeat steps 3-7 until the entire neighborhood is canvased, or you're exhausted.

,
Go home, dump all your candy on the floor, count it, and enjoy!,
Wait until next year, dreaming of sugary goodness...

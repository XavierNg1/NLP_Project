Pour ½ cup (120 milliliters) of glitter school glue into a mixing bowl.If you do not have any glitter glue at home, use clear glue instead, and add in about 1 teaspoon of glitter.
Stir in ½ cup (120 milliliters) of water, if you want a gooier slime.If you want something thicker and stretchier, sort of like Silly Putty, omit the water.
Stir everything together with a spoon.
Pour the liquid starch in, then mix it together.
Play with your slime, then store it in an airtight container when you are done.

Determine whether or not your computer is in fact subject to a keylogging malware.
If you have answered 'yes' to any of the questions in step 1, it is highly probable that you have a keylogging malware installed onto your computer.
For a more thorough approach, identify a keylogging malware with the 'netstat' method.
As you can see, you are currently in the C:\WINDOWS\system32> directory.
What you see now are the active connections on this computer.
Check the software names closely.
If you have found something suspicious, you are about to take care of it.
At this stage, you will have to cross reference the PIDs from your command prompt screen, with those on your Task Manager.
As you've noticed, the image computer does not have any malware running on the PC.
Delete the malware.
Done.
Take preventative measures in future.

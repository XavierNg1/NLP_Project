Grab any aluminum can filled with beer and place your thumb about an inch above the bottom of the can.
Place the can angled slightly downwards so that an air bubble forms at the bottom of the can, near where your thumb is positioned.
Create a small dent in the can by applying pressure.
Rock your thumb back and forth slightly, applying pressure until the aluminum can breaks.
Put your mouth over the puncture spot, elevate the can, and pop the top.

Don't pose too much.
Stand straight with your head held high.
Smile: Nobody looks good when they are miserable.
Open your eyes wide (not too wide or else you'll look startled or slightly crazy).
Direct your gaze at a spot right above the camera.
Relax as much as you can.
Quickly glance in a mirror before the photo is taken if you get the chance.
Listen to the photographer if she or he is a professional.
Practice posing and expressions in front of a mirror and by taking selfies.
Dress well at all times.

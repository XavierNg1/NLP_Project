Get in the Irish dancing position.
Next, you do preparation.
Now, you take the right foot and point it again, hop with your left foot, and place your right foot in the back.
Next, you do a jump.
Now, you take your left foot and lift it up so that's bent at about a 90 degree angle behind your right leg.
Take your right in front and point it (TURN OUT), and bring it to the position it was in a second ago (the one where it was lifted in the 90 degree angle in front of the left leg).
Taking your left foot, point it (TURN OUT) and slide, keeping your right leg straight.
Do a jump like the ones explained earlier, and angle it to the side (so you turn 90 degrees right).
Point your right foot and place it in back of your left foot, hopping with your left foot as you do so.

With your left foot, start on your toe and roll across the ball of your foot to your heel, so you're ending up on your heel.

Don't serve enormous portions.
Don’t leave bowls of chocolate, candy and nuts standing on kitchen counters where it’s all too easy to dip in each time you pass.
At a buffet table, use a small plate and fill it just once.
Stock up with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables over the holiday season.
If you’re keen not to gain over the holidays, ration yourself to one or two unhealthy foods a day.

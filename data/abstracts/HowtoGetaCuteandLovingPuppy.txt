List a whole bunch of puppies that you would like.
Do your research.
Once you have your list narrowed down to the breed (if you want a purebred) and gender, look at breeders in your area, the humane societies, and the classified adds.
If you can, go meet the puppy(s) or dog(s).
After you have looked at all possible candidates, it is time to choose.
Pick up your puppy, or have them come to you!!!!!,
Take the puppy to the veterinarian for a checkup and shots.

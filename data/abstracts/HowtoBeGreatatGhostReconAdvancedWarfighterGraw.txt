The Boneyard is one of the smaller maps available.
There is a staircase leading up to a platform at each team's base.
Snipers really have no place in this level.
There are many airplanes hulls laying around that you can climb inside.
If you're on the team that spawns near Zone D, there is a great place to spawn camp.
Desert Gulch is another smallish level that works well for Sharpshooter and Last Man Standing matches.
There are paths that lead along the edges from one base to the other, which make great trails for making flag runs in CTF games.
Quick reflexes are necessary in this level.
If you're playing a Last Man Standing match, there are several places where you can hide out.
Dry Dock is the darkest multiplayer map, making it difficult to see enemy movement.
There are plenty of walkways that go up above the floor on this level, though you shouldn't use them to quickly move to enemy territory.
In the center of the map is a choke point.
The key to victory on this stage is to know the terrain and quickly be able to pick out what movement indicates enemy motion and which is simply rain making splashes.
The fishing village is another giant map that won't work well unless you have a large game going on.
Because this takes place in a jungle, there is plenty of opportunity for long range combat.
Nowhere is a large map that puts one team up on top of a hill while the other team is separated from them by a large rocky outcropping.
This map is a camper's delight.
Rocky Cove is a symmetrical map that is based around one platform in the middle of the two spawn points.
The key to domination on this map is to control the central outcropping.
Nowhere is one of the more popular maps and so you should practice mostly on that one.

 Remember or write down the formula 15+754(a3){\displaystyle {\frac {15+7{\sqrt {5}}}{4}}(a^{3})}. Find the value of the side length and replace a{\displaystyle a}.
 Using the order of operations (PEMDAS), multiply 7{\displaystyle 7} by 5{\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}}.
 Add 15 and 15.68 together.
 Divide the sum by 4.
 Cube a, or 3.
 Finally, multiply 7.67 by the product.

Keep your operating system (OS) up-to-date.
Keep your programs up-to-date.
Keep your antivirus up-to-date and running (under MS Windows).
Use only one unique ACTIVE antivirus program.
Never download anything except on official sites (any OS) or trusted repositories (Linux/BSD/MacOS).
If you can, check binary signatures (see ] for example and the wiki article ).
Use a firewall.
If you firewall is stateless, use it for log purpose only.
Check what services (also called daemons) are running: as I said, if there is no one on the platform to unload the train, NOTHING can happen.
Don't use an admin account: it's better in Windows Vista and Seven, but if you are using an admin account, any software can ask for admin privileges, even malware you've launched recklessly.
If you don't need to play games or to use some very rare niche software, switch to Linux.

Add two beads to the leftmost string.
Thread the right string through the beads the opposite way.
Pull both ends of the strings until the beads slide up to the keychain clasp.
Feed three more beads -- two eyes and a body color -- onto the leftmost string.
Slide the right side through the beads and pull both ends until the beads slide to the top.
Repeat the whole procedure with two more beads to make the "neck.",
Take three more body beads and pull them through.

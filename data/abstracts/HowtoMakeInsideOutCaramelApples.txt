Hit the grocery store for ingredients and consider purchasing the highest quality ingredients possible.
Check your kitchen for tools you need to create the apples or head to the kitchen and bath store to pick up certain items.
Cut the apples in half lengthwise.
Slide a smaller knife around the inside of the apple, traveling near the outer edges (near the skin).
Dig into the apple centers with your melon ball scoop.
Cut the lemon in half and squeeze juice over the cut, prepare the apple slices to preserve the apple color and texture (the oxidation process will begin to turn the apple brown immediately without the lemon).








,
Pat inside and outside of apple with a paper towel to remove excessive lemon juice.
Create caramel sauce.
Line a cookie sheet, covered in parchment paper with waiting apple halves.
Pour cooled caramel into hollowed out apples and fill just below the top edges.








,
Sprinkle each apple with pecan nuts or any other nut or candy at this stage.
Slide the cookie sheets into the refrigerator and allow to set and cool for approximately 20 minutes.

Quarter apples into slices once they have set and hardened.

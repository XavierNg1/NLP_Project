Prepare the paracords with different length (Colour is optional but the length of the paracords should not be less than the following as it is better for more than less).
Slightly burn the ends of each paracord so the 7 strands inside the paracord melt into a lump-shape solid.

,
Only use 1 foot (0.3 m) black paracord and 5.5 feet (1.7 m) orange paracord.
Make an overhand knot like the picture shown.
Pull it as tight as possible and a loop on top will appear while a starting knot just below it.
Repeat the knot alternatively by changing the previous step's right to left.
Cut and burn the end of the paracord carefully, not to burn the cords beside it.

,
Congrats!,
Lets proceed to King Cobra by using the other 2 paracords prepared earlier.

,
Form an overhand knot using the grey paracord it self and pass through the orange paracord tip through it.
Repeat.
Finished.

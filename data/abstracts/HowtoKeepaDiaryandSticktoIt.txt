Make sure your diary reflects your personality.
Write in some basic information about yourself on the first page.
Start your first entry by labeling the top with the weekday and date, the time, and possibly where you were when writing that entry.
Don't be afraid to even give your diary a name.
Write your frustrations and celebrations, but also write everyday things about your schedule, your friends, and the things you like to do.
Start again if you have a break from writing.
Read your old entries every so often and see what you think now in comparison to then.
Make sure you hide it too.

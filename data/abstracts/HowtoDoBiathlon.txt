Firstly understand what is involved in a Biathlon Competition: The skier carrying their .22 rifle in a harness skis off along a cross country trail (on cross country skis).
The competitor has to be extremely fit so that despite the fast skiing, their heart rate is calm and as low as possible, to allow for accurate target shooting.
The competitor then leaves the range, skis off on the next loop, comes back into the range and the process repeats itself until the full race distance is completed.
The winner is the biathlete with the shortest overall time including time on penalty loops.
Special Requirements for Biathlon: Learn that before even contemplating this sport, shooting lessons are recommended, a gun license is mandatory and learn how to safely handle a firearm.
In some countries, to secure a shooters license may require an examination.
How to Train for Biathlon: You have to be very physically fit.
Train in shooting on prone position and standing at a rifle range.
when training at the range, get your heart rate up by doing star jumps or push ups in between each round of 5 shots.
Even in summer, train for skiing with roller skis.
Work on upper body strength at the gym.
In winter, enroll in cross country skiing lessons.
Know your body's limits.

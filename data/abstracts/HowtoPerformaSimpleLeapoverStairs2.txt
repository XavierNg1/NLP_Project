Choose a suitable set of stairs.
Start jumping from the step closest to the ground.
Keep getting higher and higher.
While you're getting higher and higher, try to make a game of it.
Practice at home if you have stairs, if you don't, use stairs at places outside of school or a park.
When you're finally at the top of the stairs to jump, run first.
If you mess up, and land on your back or butt, don't panic.
After mastering the jumping, you can teach others.

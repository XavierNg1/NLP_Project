Tuning: There are several models of Strumsticks on the market, but we'll just focus on the two most popular; the Basic and Grand Strumstick.
Strumming: Always use the neck strap and adjust it so the Strumstick is hanging close to your chest.
Now, try strumming up on all three strings.
Take as much time as you need, then try strumming on the down and upstroke.
Now, it's time to play some notes.
Move your finger to another fret, and strum again.
Try sliding you finger to another fret while strumming.
Playing songs: The frets are numbered, starting with the first fret as #1.

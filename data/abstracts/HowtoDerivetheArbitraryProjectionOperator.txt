Begin with a spin-1/2 quantum state pointing in some arbitrary direction n{\displaystyle {\mathbf {n} }}.
Calculate Pn{\displaystyle P_{\mathbf {n} }} through matrix mechanics.
Decompose the diagonal elements in terms of Pauli matrices.
Decompose the off-diagonal elements in terms of Pauli matrices.
Simplify the resulting expression.

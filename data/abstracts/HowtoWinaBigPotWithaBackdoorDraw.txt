Know what a backdoor flush draw is and do an internet search of this term.
Examine your cards, there are only two possibilities: you either have one or two of your hole cards of the three to a flush.
If the turn is the fourth card to your flush draw - continue and if not fold.
On the river, if you complete your flush: bet or raise.
On the flop, you must have at least 23:1 pot odds when calling a bet.
Preflop, play with hands appropriate to your position and to the table you are playing on.
Make a few exceptions to the above guidelines:


Pot odds: with pot odds of 22:1, call a bet if the players after you are loose and you are sure they will not raise.
Add value to your backdoor flush draw, on the flop, with more outs.
Use caution when the flop is paired such as Q♦-Q♥-5♣ or connected T♦-9♠-J♥, and you are anticipating betting and raising.

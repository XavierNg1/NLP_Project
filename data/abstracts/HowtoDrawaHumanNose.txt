It also helps to work with a subject, be it a live human being, or a photograph.
It's best for this exercise to work in pencil and use a light touch so that guiding lines can be erased easily.
Next, draw a line directly down the middle of the egg shape from top to bottom, so the egg looks bisected.

,
Draw another line across the middle of your egg from left to right.
Start the first line of the bridge of the nose, just above that equator.
Continuing that j, draw a small curve at the bottom edge that will be the hole of one of your nostrils.

,
Draw a small semi-circle on the other side of the curve of the j for the other nostril.

,
Draw two semi-circles above the others you already made to complete the top, cartilaginous part of the nostril.
Draw a circle at the base of these two lines, where you stopped in between the equator and chin.

,
Draw two smaller circles toward the bottom of the circle you just drew for the holes of your nostrils.

,
Draw a semi-circle over the smaller circles you just made to create the fleshy part of the nostrils.

Practice with chewing gum.
Start out with small portions of food; first soft food, like ice-cream or yogurt.
Once you have mastered it with the soft foods, try chewing larger portions at a time, as you would normally eat.
Move on to the more solid foods now, like fruits, rice, and bread.
Once you are past this stage, try the hardest foods, such as granola bars and cereals.

Section off your faux bang area.
Put the rest of your hair in a high Ponytail in the back of your head using a hair tie.
Unclip the front section you created for your faux bang roll.
Using a one-inch curling iron, curl the front section in a backward sweep piece by piece.
Tease each section of the hair that you just curled using a narrow-toothed comb to back-comb the hair.
Take the ends of the hair that you curled and begin to roll them down into a big curl directly above your forehead.
Pin the curl with a bobby pin in the center and spray with hair spray.

Next, curl the hair in the Ponytail in small sections.

Keeping the hair in small sections, tease the hair just like you did with the front sections.
Spray with hair spray and the rest is up to you!,
To truly look like Rosie the Riveter, add a vintage bandana just behind your front roll.
Finished.

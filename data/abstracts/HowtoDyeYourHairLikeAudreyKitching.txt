Buy hair stripper if you have previously dyed your hair.
Buy bleach.
Make sure to take breaks between each session of bleach, about 2 or 3 weeks.
When your hair is as pale as you can get it, buy Special Effects hair dye.
When dying your hair pink, you can leave the dye in overnight if it is semi-permanent.

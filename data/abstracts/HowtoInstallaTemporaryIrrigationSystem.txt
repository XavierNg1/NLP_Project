Decide whether the cost and labor of a temporary system is cost effective in your situation.
Decide how and where you can connect to a water source.
Lay out the area you will be watering to determine the number of individual sprinkler heads you will need, and the amount of pipe and other materials required.

,
Choose the type of sprinkler heads you will use, then use the manufacturer's literature to determine the spacing and water requirements for each head.
Connect to your water source, using utility approved devices to control backflow and to meter water usage if required.
Run mains, the larger pipes that provide water to branch lines and individual zones (if you need to break the system down or branch it for efficient watering) along edges of sidewalks or buildings.
Install adapter tees where you will install your sprinkler heads, spacing them according to the design or manufacturer's coverage literature.
After installing the piping system and sprinkler head adapter tees, flush all the pipes with water to remove trash that would otherwise stop up the sprinkler heads when they are installed.
Check the system for obvious leaks while the system flushes.
Install the heads to the adapter tees using suitable connectors.
Preset the rotation (of rotating heads) to cover the amount of radius needed to cover the area you are watering, and to avoid spraying adjacent buildings or pavements where the water is at least wasted, if not damaging.

,
Turn on the water, doing so slowly to avoid water hammer or other shock to the equipment.
Readjust any heads that are not covering their full area, and look for dry spots that often occur where the radius of two heads meet.
Keep in mind that since this is a temporary system, the materials, including the valves, pipes, and heads will be on top of the soil or grass.

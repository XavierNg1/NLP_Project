Tell your parents a day or two before you plan to miss school you are feeling bad.
That night, set your alarm for 2:00 AM.
As long as they did not accuse you of faking it the night before, wake up later than you usually do in the morning.
If they take you to the doctor's office, groan and rub your face a lot.

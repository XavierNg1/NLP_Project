Okay, first say to them, "Stop Instant messaging me!,
Still instant messaging you?,
This is the fun part -They keep IM-ing you write something like "Who is this?,
If they continue, go to their name on your buddy list, right click and select block.
Although many people may say no because they want to talk to someone else on AIM, just put yourself as away or sign out.

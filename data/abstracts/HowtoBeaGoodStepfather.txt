Beware that the children may also have their biological father as a father figure.
Be patient when waiting for your new stepchild to respond to your caring, affection, and love.
Spend time with the stepchild in his or her activities.
Balance the time and gifts you give your own children with the stepchild.
Invite the stepchild to participate in your own activities.
Communicate clearly and calmly.
Be openly caring.
Respect the child's private space.
Raise the child in alignment with the child's mother's wishes, not contrary to them.
Help plan the future of the stepchild.
Be a good example to your stepchild.
Remember, being a step-dad is a leadership role as part of a team.
Try to forget that he/she is not your biological child.

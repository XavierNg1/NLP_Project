Start off by cleaning up the header as best as you can.
Know that after you’re done cleaning the header, rinse of the header with water and proceed to dry it with the paper towel.
Find a place where you’re going to start the labor intensive work or sanding down the header.
Grab your 800 grit sandpaper and rip it into four equal pieces.
Spread the metal polish over the part of the header you'll be working on Make sure not to over apply the metal polish.
Once you’re done with the sanding/polishing of the header, clean it again with your soapy water and give it a good wipe down with your rag/cloth or paper towels.Then give it a good rinse with some water.
Grab another rag/cloth and get to work with the metal polish working it into the header until you get the shine you want.

Find a handbell choir in your area.
Know some basic music fundamentals, or be prepared to learn them fairly quickly.
Understand the basic idea of a handbell choir.
Familiarize yourself with the anatomy of a handbell.
Begin by putting on gloves (worn by most choirs to avoid smudging or tarnishing the handbells) and picking up two bells and holding them in front of your chest, either angling towards you or facing straight up, depending on the way your choir has chosen to stand with the bells up.
To ring one bell, move it forward by extending it away from your body in a circular motion, with the handle moving slightly ahead of the bell.
Damp the bell by touching it lightly to your chest when you complete the circle.
Repeat until you are comfortable with this motion, and then try with the other bell in your other hand.
Understand that the length of time you spend ringing (and thus, the size of your circle) varies according to the length of the note you are playing.
Understand your role as a member of a handbell choir.
Mark your music, if you find it helpful at first.
Keep the beat.
Have fun.

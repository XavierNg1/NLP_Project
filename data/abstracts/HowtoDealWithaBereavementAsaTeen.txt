Never be afraid to cry.
Talk to someone you trust.
Help yourself to remember them.
Don't blame yourself.
If you are religious, find comfort in the fact they have gone to a better place.
Visit their grave site.
Pray.
Have some alone time.
Remember the person how you want to.
Remember that they loved you.
Say goodbye.

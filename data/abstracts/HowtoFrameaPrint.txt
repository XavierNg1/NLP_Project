Measure and cut a mat-board and a mounting board to the overall size calculated to create a mat 4 to 6 inches larger than the print so as to reveal 2 to 3 inches (5 cm to 7 cm) of the mat on all sides of a print.
Obtain a frame matching the dimensions of the finished matted print/mounting board.

,
Lay the cut-to-size mounting board face up and center the print on it.

,
Tape the print to the mounting board with archival tape "hinges" at the top edge only so a print "hangs" and expands and contracts with the humidity.
Make a mat for the print using archival mat-board to prevent the print from touching the glass by doing the following.
Cut the mat-board from the backside along these lines in one stroke for each cut.
Lay the frame face down.

,
Clean both sides of the glass to be used in the frame and lay it into the fame.
Lay the display side of finished, cut mat-board into the frame directly on the glass.

,
Lay mounted print in the frame face down on the mat-board installed previously.
Install backing material of same size as mounting-board/mat into the frame on top of the mounting board just laid in.
The print is now framed in a professional manner that will last for years.

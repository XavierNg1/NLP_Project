Combine orange juice and simple syrup in a bowl.
Pour mixture into a clean, empty ice cube tray.
Cover the tray with aluminum foil or plastic wrap.
Stick toothpicks through the plastic wrap or aluminum foil and into each cube.
Place the tray in the freezer.
Remove the tray the freezer once juice has completely frozen and remove the cover.
Bend and twist the ice cube tray to loosen your mini ice lollies, then remove with the toothpick handle.

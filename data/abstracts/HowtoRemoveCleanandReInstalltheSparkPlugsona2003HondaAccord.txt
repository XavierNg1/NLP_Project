Make sure the car if off.
Pop the hood and look for the ignition coil cover.
Look for each individual ignition coil.
Once you have completed your inspection, you need to remove each connection to the ignition coil.
Switch between your 10mm sockets to remove the bolts holding the ignition coil in-place.
Remove the spark plug.
Inspect the plug to be sure you can keep that one or replace with a new one.
Once you have the "spec" for the spark clearance, use your feeler gauge to make sure it is in the correct specification.
Re-install the spark plugs.

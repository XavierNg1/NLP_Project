Set out the project items on a hard, flat surface.
Lay two pieces of paper on a hard, flat work surface.
Prepare the materials for fast work.
Use the clear nail polish to create the base of your nails.
As soon as you've dropped a thick nail shape of clear nail polish, apply the glitter.
Let the paint dry for three minutes, at least, then remove the excess glitter.
Create ten more nails.
Make sure the nails are dry.
Gently remove the nails from the paper with tweezers.
Apply a coat of clear or neon polish to your own nails.
Press the glitter nails firmly into the coat on your own nails and let them all dry in place completely.
Apply a tough top coat to your nails.
Finished.

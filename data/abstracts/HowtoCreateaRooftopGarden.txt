Before you begin, find out if it is possible to create a garden on your roof.
Work out a comfortable access way to the roof.
Choose a design, figure out how you will layout the roof garden.
Work out a planting scheme, with plants to work well with the natural light you have, humidity, wind etc.
Get containers/planters, furniture etc to finish it off.
Decide how you will water the garden.
Consider windbreaks, as a rooftop garden will be very windy.
Remember there are various details to consider when building a roof garden, terrace or any other structure on the roof, so it is perhaps worth consulting a specialist (or a few specialists) before you start your project.

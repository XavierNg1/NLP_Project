If the matching ends are triangles, find the area of one triangle using this guide.
If the matching ends are squares or rectangles, multiply base by height.
If the matching ends are circles, multiply pi by the radius squared.
If the matching ends are parallelograms, multiply base by height.
If the matching ends are another polygon, break the shape down into triangles to solve.
Note the area of this end on your paper and leave it alone for now.

Select a bag.
Pack the bag for any Medical emergencies: If you don't have any medical problems then forget this step, unless you want to bring a first aid kit.
Pack for Feminine Emergencies: Alright, you got your period during B period....what to do?,
Pack for clothing Emergencies: Gym is the major cause of wardrobe emergencies.
Pack for odour related emergencies: Everyone who uses deodorant forgets deodorant sometimes...but no one has to know that YOU do... so include a stick of deodorant in your bag.
Pack so you have something to eat in a Food Emergency situation: If you are rushing to catch the bus and you forget to grab your lunch, no worries, you can eat something from the status you keep, for example a few granola bars, in your locker.
Smile: Your emergency bag is useless if you can't smile.

Take care with the purpose of celebration.
Consider an example from nature.
Extrapolate this example to a business achievement scenario.
Recognize that while celebrations have their place, a business must put more effort into concentrating on how to enhance performance.
Don't push success too far; instead, acknowledge that a former success occurred and had its place in building your business but let it rest there.
Keep the celebrating for the things that really matter and for major achievements.

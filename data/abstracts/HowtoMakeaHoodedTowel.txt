Purchase a large bath towel and a hand towel in coordinating colors.
Cut a hand towel in half horizontally so that you end up with two squares.
Fold the hand towel in half, and sew along the cut edge using a ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance.
Turn the hood inside out.
Add a border to the hood, if desired.
Consider adding some animal ears to the hood.
Cut four large triangles or half circles out of the extra hand towel half.
Sew along the angled/curved edges using a ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance, then turn them inside out.
Cut two slits on the top of the hood.
Slide the ears by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) into each slit and pin in place.
Sew the ears down from the inside of the hood using a ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance.
Spread the bath towel out horizontally, find the midpoint along the top edge, and mark it with a pin.
Position the hood above the bath towel, and overlap the two edges by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters).Place the hood above the bath towel.
Sew the towels together using a straight stitch.Remove the pins when you are done and trim off any loose threads.

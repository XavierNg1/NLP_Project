Gather these items: plastic coated wire hangers; wooden clothespins; polyester, braided cord; a ruler; scissors; and some waterproof glue.
Join the two hangers at the neck with the braided cord.
Make your drying rack with five clothespins.
Fasten the clothespin with the cord attached to the hanger with many clove hitches.
Connect the neck of the hanger to the horizontal rod directly below it to keep that rod from sagging.
To keep the knots from sliding on the horizontal bar and from unraveling, apply a bit of fabric glue or clear nail polish.

Use your heavy duty clothes drying rack without reservation and hang heavier items such as small towels and shorts.

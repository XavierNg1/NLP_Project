Babies thrive on routine, so it's not only "okay" it's desirable to have your one year old on some sort of schedule.
Alternate times of stimulation with times of rest.
Be sure their area is safe.
Provide finger foods.
If you want to expose your baby to good music, do it with a boom box and CDs to help them go to sleep.

,
Babies love to dance either alone or with you.
Teach them smells.
Repeat what they say.
Say and See.
Make sure the baby has time to determine their own play.
Make sure your baby gets enough sleep.
To really stimulate your baby, be very impressed when your baby is pleased with herself.
Don't forget the value of failure and practice.
Teach children age appropriate behavior, then let them do it!,
Skin stimulation is nice with a massage after bath, or just a gentle backrub during quiet time.
Enjoy your 12 month old.

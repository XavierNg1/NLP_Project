Make the fact that you cannot help them explicit at the time they let your know they're headed your way.
If they ask you for accommodation outright, be diplomatic and polite.
If money is an issue, consider whether you can help fund their stay.
Be sure to make good on any promises you've made to them about spending time with them during the day.
If you want to see your relatives but you don't want them to stay with you, avoid inviting them.

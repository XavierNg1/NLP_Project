Start by finding a large, gently pitched slope, preferably with not too many people.
Practice making slow, parallel turns with your skis.

,
Position your skis a little more than shoulder's width apart.
Apply pressure to the forward-inside edge of the ski that will be the 'outside' ski for the turn (i.e. right ski, if turning to left).
Keep your forward and into-the-hill hip angle and stick with it throughout the turn.
Straighten your turning leg and step onto inside edge of the other ski at the same moment as you plant your pole for the next turn ("plant up", meaning plant pole as you straighten up and shift your weight).
Build a slight up-down rhythm that is also slightly rotary (forward-up at the beginning, or top, of the turn, on your big toe, and sinking to have weight slightly farther back onto your inside arch-heel as you come through the turn, to keep the edge from skidding, then up-forward again as you make your next pole plant.

,
At first, you can allow almost all your weight to be riding on the inside edge of your outside (or turning) ski.

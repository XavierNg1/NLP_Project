There are many different types of rock songs, and it would be extremely hard to cover all of them on one page.
Get a pen or pencil and a piece of paper to record your ideas.
Develop the main melody.
Often melody starts with the same note as the "ground note" or root in the key chord, for example in D major it would be a d-note and in E minor an e-note.
The two main components of a song are the verse and the chorus.
Think of a chord progression that is a little different from the hook and (possibly) in a different key.
Develop a background.
You should now be able to write your solo.
Put them all together.
Organize a band.
Get some good recording equipment and record the song.
Show your song to your friends and family.
You can now burn the song to a CD and release it to public, or write more songs and produce an album.

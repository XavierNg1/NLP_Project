Pay attention to what they're really saying and doing.
Don't show fear or vulnerability.
If you're facing a crazy person, especially someone who's been in and out of therapy, you can sometimes talk them down by staying calm and listening to what they have to say - and responding like a therapist.
Make them think you're not worth it by saying something like, "Look, we already know that you would obviously win..." etc.
Answer anything they say politely without insults.
Try not to anger them to come at you.
If it's a personal fight over something that has happened - they are jealous because someone they are attracted to, likes you more, or something you own that they wish they had, or if they feel betrayed, or if you did betray them in some way like gossip, then try conflict resolution.
Make sure you know what they want to do with you.

Don't escalate it by getting back at them.
Do not attack first.
Take physical threats seriously.

Prepare to pans.
Add a sprinkling of the cumin seeds if you have it, not all of them though, let them fry up for a few seconds and let them crack open a bit.
Add in the rest of the veg and garlic and what not and toss it round and let that fry and soften up over a medium heat.

,
Add your meat into the other pan, straight away.
Try experimenting.
Stir everything around making sure everything is mixed, add the tiny amount of lemon juice.
Add the beef bouillon and perhaps some Worcestershire sauce if you have it.

,
Another thing you could add at this point is a teaspoon of cocoa powder, chocolate works really well with chili.

,
Chop up your fresh coriander and add that in now before simmering.

,
Let it simmer for about 15 - 20 minutes, to break the chopped tomatoes down a bit, and to get that sauce thickened up.

,
Serve with long grain rice.
Get some more of your chopped coriander and sprinkle it on top of the chili at the point you serve it on the plate.

,
The peppers make it more rustic and they like burst with flavor when you bite into them as they're really juicy.
Finished.

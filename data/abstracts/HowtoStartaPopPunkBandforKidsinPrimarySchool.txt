Think to yourself, are you really determined to do this?,
Try to find a few people for your band.
Find a place to practise, this could be anywhere...
Practise!,
Experiment!,
Once your band is ready start writing your own songs.
Make a band name!,
This is a good time to let people know about your band now.
Raise some band fund.
By now, your band should be going on well... With your band fund try to get a cheap video camera and make simple music videos.
Now your band should probably have a fair amount of fans.
Now you must buy a camcorder or some sort of equipment to record yourself on.
Try to get onto a record label.
You should be fairly popular now...

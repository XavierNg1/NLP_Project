Purchase a pad of #140 cold pressed watercolor paper in 11" x 14" size.
Set up a palette using tube watercolors in at least two shades of violet; red violet and blue violet.
Select a #10 watercolor brush that comes to a good point.
Assemble other items.
Lightly sketch three or four large balls to represent hydrangea's blooms.
Make these blooms appear rounded by "under painting" the sunlight and shadow right on them at the start.
Break up the surface of each ball by drawing in pencil small circles to represent the many flowers comprising a blossom.
Challenge yourself to see if you can make the water carry the color from the top of the large round blossom to the bottom.
Touch the tip of a damp brush into violet paint that you have squeezed out on your palette.
Help the colors mingle by making little bridges of water with a thin, damp brush tip, creating paths for the paint to travel along.
Move to the next blossom.
If you want to make a white blossom, simply paint the negative space and leave the tiny flowers alone.
Heighten the colors while it's still damp.
Make woody, irregular stems with brown paint, fatter in areas that hold entire blossoms and tiny when glimpsed through the blossom.
Paint leaves to fill space around the blossoms by wetting a leaf shape.
Add veins to the leaves by scratching into a damp area with a sharp edge of a credit card.
Continue painting blossoms, branches, twigs, and leaves until your page is filled.
Add a background, if you wish.

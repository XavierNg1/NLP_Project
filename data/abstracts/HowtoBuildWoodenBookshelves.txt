Design your shelving based on your available space.
Make a shopping list for your base frame: 1" x 12" lumber, measuring the length of your outer box, your vertical supports, and your shelving.
Make a list for your other materials- supporting 1" x 2" strips x the length of your shelving; 1/8" plywood to cover the back; 4 supporting pins per shelf; lots of wood screws (standard drywall screws work fine) and small wire brads to mount the back.
Cut the wood to fit the design of the base box.
Drill the necessary holes.
Mount the vertical sections.
Finished.

CC the enemy healers.
Use silencing shot first against a healer and than try to scatter shot him and then launch an ice-trap towards him so he is CC'd for 9 seconds.

When a teammate is carrying the enemy flag and is nearly the home base, lay some traps so enemy players will walk into them and get stopped.

Observe how many masters you have in your life.
Listen but don't change for every person who insists they know what's best for you.
Consider what matters to you in life.
Think about ways in which you might contribute to your own vulnerabilities.
Develop your own values and be happy that they truly represent you.
Don't apologize for being emotional, sensitive or tender.
Practice self validation.
Find your own pathway to contentment.
Be the best you can be.
Respect yourself and respect others.

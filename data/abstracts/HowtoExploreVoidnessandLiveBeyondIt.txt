Consider a bold theory for starters, namely that voidness or emptiness occurs because it is in-between what is "there" to us.
Examine other living things.
Consider non-living things.
Look for evidence of a beginning which shows the mark of a scheduled plan.
Work out what your feelings are in relation to the idea of void, such as whether you find the idea of voidness scary, comforting, or strange, and so forth.
Look where new emotions point you.
See how you can use your thinking and experiences to improve your life and make the world a better place.
Finally, remember above all this: In a world void of pre-determined meaning, you are free to make your own.

Maybe you're just afraid of becoming religious?,
Understand that "love your neighbor" is 9/10ths of accepting Christ.
Recognize that Christ's words are meant to be taken spiritually.
Observe that Christ's entire ministry on earth could be termed a revolt against the Powers That Be.
Realize that the concept of having a Saviour for forgiveness of your sins, while very religious-sounding, is just good government from God's point of view.
But wait; isn't Jesus the guy who threw profiteers out of the Temple, and condemned the established hierarchy?,
See that your Christophobia may just be a fear of commitment.

Try a short detox diet focused on drinking water infused with vegetables and fruit.
Decide how long you will do the detox diet.
Place the cut-up the fruits and vegetables in the water and refrigerate for a few hours.
Drink at least the recommended amount of 64 ounces of water a day.
Eat water rich food throughout the diet.
Remember that this is not a long-term solution.

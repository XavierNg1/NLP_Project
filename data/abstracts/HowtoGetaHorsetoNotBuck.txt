Learn what to do when a horse starts bucking.
Ride safely, and make a habit of it.
Scan your tack before tacking up to make sure there's nothing that would irritate your horse.
Groom your horse and check for any irritating things that don't belong (like burrs).
Check the girth once it's secure to make sure it isn't pinching the horse.
Sit deep and make sure your heels are down.
Tighten the reins if they aren't in contact with the horse's mouth, and pull the horse's head to the side (near your knee).
Circle the horse at a walk three times, the circle expanding each time, then straighten the horse out at a walk.

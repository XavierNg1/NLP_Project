Go to forge and start a session on Sandtrap.
Go to the front of the elephant and stack all of the plasma batteries in the front, basically right next to the fusion coils.
Go to the back of the elephant again and shoot at only one of the fusion coils, then stand back and watch the most amazing form of the flying elephant.
Another way is to put as much junk as you can pile on and try to drive it.
One of the more simple ways to fly the elephant is to simply take a scorpion, warthog, or anything else with a good size and hold on to it as you make it get stuck in a corner or where the driver is and fly away, and the elephant should follow you wherever you go.

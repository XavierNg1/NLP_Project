To begin your piano tuner search, get recommendations from the following:

Universities and music schools/academies



 


Dealers that sell top quality pianos up to concert range.
If you've got a local orchestra call them and find out who they use.
Visit the websites of the piano tuners you are interested in using.
When you get in touch with a tuner, ask them for references of previous customers or check for this information on the website.
When you call to schedule a potential appointment, get them to spend a few moments telling a little about themselves regarding their experience and training.
Ultimately, you might need to give a tuner a paid "trial" run.

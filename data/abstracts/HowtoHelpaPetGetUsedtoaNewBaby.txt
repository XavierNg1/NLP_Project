Avoid any force.

Let the pet sniff or be around the baby's belongings.

Walk around the pet with the baby in your arms or keep a distance from the pet during play time, but don't engage in any direct contact yet.
Use common sense and know when it's a right time to approach the pet while it's sleeping.

Let time pass and keep observing the behavior of both the pet and baby when they're around each other.

Sit down with the baby in your lap somewhere that the pet usually goes around or hangs out.

Plan ahead.
Consider cutting the bar in half or into quarters with a knife.Bubble bars create a ton of bubbles, and sometimes, you don't even need to use the entire bar to get a decent amount.
Make sure your bathtub is clean, then start filling it with water.
Crumble the bar, and hold it under the running tap.The bar will start to melt in your hand and release its scent and/or color.
Turn off the tap when the tub is full and give the water a swish with your hand.
Get into the tub, and relax for 10 to 20 minutes.

Try new activities.One way to enjoy being single is to do things that you can enjoy on your own.Think of those hobbies and interests that you’ve been thinking of doing, but didn’t have the time because you were in a relationship.
Be social.You’ve got the opportunity to spend time with friends and family that make you happy.
Consider dating.This doesn’t mean that you should immediately find someone else to love.

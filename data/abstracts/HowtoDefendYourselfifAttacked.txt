Observe the person (or people) attacking you.
Do not fight if you don't have to.
Stay alert and prepare yourself.
When the aggressor attacks, deliver a proportional response.
Try to disarm your attacker so that you have the opportunity to escape.
Always remain in the defensive position.
If you can't escape, protect yourself as best as you can.
If it escalates, create a weapon.
As soon as you can, escape and seek help.
Seek medical attention if needed.

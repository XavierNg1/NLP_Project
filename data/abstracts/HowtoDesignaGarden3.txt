Look for space.
Choose locations for “big annuals.” Big annuals—such as sunflowers—will work best along the outer borders of an annual bed.
Choose locations for “mound formers.” These are flowers like marigolds, California poppies and geraniums.
Choose locations for additional “spiky growers.” Spiky growers include plants like salvia, angelonia, and snapdragons.
Choose locations for “leafy plants.” This will include your grasses, perilla, ornamental cabbage, and coleus.

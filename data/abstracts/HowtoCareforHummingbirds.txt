How to attract hummingbirds.
Provide adequate shelter.
Ensure that the hummingbirds get both nectar and insects.
Give hummingbirds a place to perch.
Ensure sufficient sunlight in your garden.
Expect one regular hummingbird to your garden.
Check the area to make sure the parents are not foraging food for themselves or the babies.
Look for signs that the birds are in distress (parents, or babies), or any other bizarre behaviour (such as, avoiding the nest, not eating, or a bird or egg goes missing).
If the eggs or babies have been abandoned, carefully extract the birds from their environment.
Contact your nearest Animal Rescue, or Bird Rescue and give them your situation.
Check the scene to make sure there are no dangerous predators about.
Place the bird on a soft material (cloth preferably), and put it into a dark box, but make sure that oxygen is plentiful.

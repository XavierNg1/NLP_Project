Find a hair tie.
Cut a rectangle out of fabric that is 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wide and 18 inches (45.72 centimeters).
Fold the rectangle in half lengthwise, with the right sides together.
Place the hair tie inside it the rectangle.
Pin the corners together to keep the fabric in place.
Sew along the long edge, using a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance.
Turn the tube inside out so that the right sides of the fabric are facing out.Attach a safety pin to one of the narrow edges.
Tuck both of the narrow raw edges into the tube by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters).Make sure you do this on both sides of the tube.
Bring the two edges together until the touch, then sew them together using a ladder stitch.
Finished.

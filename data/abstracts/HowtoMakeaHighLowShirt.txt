Find an old t-shirt or button down shirt in your closet.
Choose a shirt that is loose.
Opt for a shirt that has a flap in front and back.
Try on the shirt.
Pinch a point in the back center of the shirt where you want your low hem to fall.
Lay the shirt on your craft table.
Draw a downward arc with your fabric pen from the front dot to the back dot.
Cut along the arc with very sharp fabric scissors.
Turn your scissors horizontally on the bottom of the back (low) hem to make a flat edge.
Try on your shirt.
Turn your shirt inside out if you want to hem it at the bottom.

,
Plug in your iron and set it upright on your ironing board to heat up.

,
Flip the bottom edge of the fabric up approximately one-half inch (1.3cm) and iron it in place.
Fold it a second time if you want a t-shirt-like hem.
Set up your sewing machine.
Sew a close stitch along the inside edge of the hem.

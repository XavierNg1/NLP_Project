Lunge your mini.
Jump your mini over cavalletti poles on the highest setting.
Consider having a young child ride your mini.
Train your mini to drive.
Brush him down as you usually do, and if you have a riding bridle, put it on.
If you're using a bridle, detach the reins and clip on two lunge lines or extremely long lead ropes (four feet past his haunches), on the bit rings.

,
With a halter, clip onto the side rings that you'd clip the cross-ties onto.

,
Carrying a dressage whip (not a lunge whip), take your mini out to a medium-sized enclosed area (arena, small paddock, etc.).
Start walking beside him, holding both "reins", and slowly fall back to about three feet directly behind him.
Continue walking, and turning with soft pressure on the reins.

,
Do about three sessions of this (depending on how well he understands), then attach something heavy to him.
Continue having him drag the branches.

Choose when to begin giving your child an allowance.
Decide how much to give.
Set a schedule for the allowance.
Open a bank account for your child.Once you start giving your child an allowance, you can also help him or her open a bank account as a place to keep some of the money.
Decide if you want to have the allowance be dependent upon chores.Some parents think it is important to give a child an allowance only of the condition that chores like making the bed, cleaning the dinner table, taking out the trash, etc.
Consider tying an allowance to school performance.The considerations for this approach are very similar to those you must weigh when deciding whether or not to relate your child’s allowance and responsibility for chores.
Set guidelines for how the allowance can be used.To teach your child the value of money, you will want to monitor how he or she spends the allowance, but don’t dictate the spending.
Let your child make mistakes.You may be tempted to give your two cents on everything your child wants to spend the allowance on.
Evaluate the allowance periodically.Every so often, consider the amount of the allowance you provide against your child’s age, needs, and level of responsibility.
Explain if you need to lower your child’s allowance.If you are unable to raise an allowance, or must reduce it due to a financial hardship or your own budgeting needs, take the time to talk about this with your child.
Create an allowance contract.When your child is old enough, consider drafting an allowance contract—a simple document that explains the terms of the allowance.

Focus on learning the progression in one key to get used to the sound and movement.
Set a metronome to 4/4 time, at a speed you can comfortably play along with.
Play the I chord for four bars to kick off the progression.
Play the IV chord for two bars, then return to the I chord for two bars.
Play one bar of the V chord.
Play one bar of the IV, the I, and the V again to get back to the beginning.
Return to four bars of the I chord and repeat.
Use the "shuffle" or swing feel when strumming.
Play the root note of each chord at the beginning of the measure to keep the progression alive.
Start with two quick strums of the E power chord.
Place your ring finger two frets down, on the A, and strum two more quick strums.
Keep alternating the E and A for four full bars.
Drop down one string to the A-chord after four bars.
Again, place your ring finger two frets down and alternate every beat for two measures.
Return to the E power chord pattern for two bars.
Add your ring finger one string down and two frets over to go from the E to a B.
Use your pinky to stretch all the way to the sixth fret on the G string.
Use this alternating, two-note pattern through all three measures of the turnaround.
Add in some palm muting, the pentatonic scale, and mixed up rhythms for the second half of each bar for a unique riffing and solo style.

Train.
During the summer, run at least five days a week.
Give yourself a break if needed.
Work on your breathing.
Always stretch before and after running.
Remember always to have a good diet.
Start running meets.
During a race, pace yourself and run relaxed (do not confuse this with slow).
Don't push yourself too hard on recovery days.
Don't feel you need to win all the time.

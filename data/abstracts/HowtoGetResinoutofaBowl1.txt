Check the tips and warnings at the bottom of the page so you don't accidentally break your pipe.
Look inside your pipe to see where the resin has collected.
Clean it.
Place your pipe into a Ziplock and fill it with isopropyl alcohol; not all the way to the top but just enough to cover the bowl.
Let it sit for at least 3 hours.
Go to the sink and run warm to hot water.
Continue to rinse your pipe until you cannot smell any isopropyl (it is flammable).

Slide the trampoline into the fore and aft tracks
,
Tie a barrel not in the end of the 1/8” ropes.
With the 1/4” ropes tie a bowline knot through the double grommets on the outsides of the aft grommet section.
Now tighten all of the ropes to achieve the desired tension on the trampoline.
Trim the excess rope and melt the end with a lighter (be careful not to melt the trampoline!),Time to go sailing!

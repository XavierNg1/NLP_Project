If you have questions about her schedule or general terms, again, make sure you read her website first.
Do not ask about possible activities and avoid code words or acronyms.
Ask her if she's free at the particular time you want to get together.
Be sure to give her your full name, address and phone number or hotel room number.

Have fun, be a gentleman, and be safe!

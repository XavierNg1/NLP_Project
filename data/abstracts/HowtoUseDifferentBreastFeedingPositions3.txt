Allow your baby to set the pace.
Be ready to offer the other breast to baby if it appears that she is still hungry after emptying the first breast.
Begin each feeding session with the opposite breast of the one that was used first during the last feeding.
Insert your finger into the corner of babyâ€™s mouth to break suction when necessary.

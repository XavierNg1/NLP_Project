Choose your best starting position.
Keep a steady start.
Swing your arms.
Don't sprint at the beginning of a distance race.
Stay humble.
Don't get distracted.
If you are running in an oval racetrack, try to be in the lane closest to the center because it takes you the shortest time to complete the track.

If you'd like, drink an energy drink or eat chocolate before the race.
Keep your hands loose in a long distance run.

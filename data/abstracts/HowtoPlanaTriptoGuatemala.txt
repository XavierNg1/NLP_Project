Plan on flying into La Aurora International Airport in Guatemala City, Guatemala.
Start your trip in the colonial town of La Antigua, Guatemala which is only 45 minutes from the capital.
Spend a minimum of 3 days in Antigua to make the most of your trip.
Check out the local farmers market.
Go to one of the many travel agencies and book a shuttle ride to Lake Atitlan.
If you haven't felt like you've had enough adventure yet and still have plenty of money to spend take a trip to the ancient Mayan pyramids of Tikal and El Mirador.
Once you've found an agency you like, continue to use them to get a ride back to the airport.

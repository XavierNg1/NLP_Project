Provide your crabs a good home.
Get at least two fiddler crabs, they live in large colonies in the wild and will be lonely.
Provide a nice large bowl of water for them.
Put food in a small bowl.
Give them a branch or two to climb on.
Only hold them if absolutely necessary.
Every so often your crabs will molt.

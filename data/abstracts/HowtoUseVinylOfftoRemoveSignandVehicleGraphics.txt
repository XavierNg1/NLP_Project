Wipe Vinyl-Off onto ONLY the vinyl you want to remove using:


Pad Sponge Foam Brush Fine Nap Roller Paper Towel, etc.
For best results, warm surfaces immediately before removal.
Allow a few minutes dwell time(very little waiting needed)


Vinyl-Off penetrates the vinyl and attacks the adhesive behind it.
Lift an edge and pull.
Remove any remaining adhesive by either re-applying Vinyl-Off or applying Adhesive –Off.

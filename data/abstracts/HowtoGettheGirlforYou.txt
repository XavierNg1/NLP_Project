Remember the last time you fell for a girl?,
Remain a Mystery!,
Never tell her your name first!,
Don't be desperate to talk to her!,
Never talk down other women, especially women she knows or your exes!

,
Find out what sort of person she is!,
Don't blabber on about this and that, and how you're so great!,
Make her smile and laugh!,
Get to know when shes feeling down or sad!,
Never let a silence build up between you.
Be confident but not conceited.
Never use cheesy lines!,
Don't get annoyed or worried if some other guy is the center of attention!,
Don't make a big deal of saying hello to her every time you see her!,
Always smell nice!

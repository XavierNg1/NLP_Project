Watch yourself in the mirror.
Resist the urge to jerk the weight to "get it started.",
Work with a spotter if you're going to lift heavy weights.
Add weight to barbells or dumbbells without clanging the plates together.
Rack the weights when you're done.
Dry your sweat from the bench when you're done.

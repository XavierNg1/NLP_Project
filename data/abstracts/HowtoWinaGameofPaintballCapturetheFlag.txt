Move; as soon as the horn/whistle blows get to cover.
Spread your team out, don’t concentrate your entire team in one section of the course, it makes it far too easy for an opponent to move around your flank and take down half of your team.

,
Move in pairs if possible.
It is vital that you keep moving, being covered and covering your teammates (shooting down range (at the enemy’s position) when they move).

,
Move down the sides of the course if possible, this gives you a better angle of fire on the enemy to thin their numbers before the eventual run for the flag.

,
Pin down the opposition (fire at them so intensely that they won’t wish to break cover) when moving for the flag.
Moving back to your base with the flag can be done multiple ways.
Detail a course of action to be taken in the event that the opposing team reaches the flag before you do.
Break cover and start firing if an opponent has the flag and is running towards their base.
Finding yourself cornered, launch yourself quickly and unexpectedly from cover to cover, firing as you go.
Make sure your team has the whole field covered.

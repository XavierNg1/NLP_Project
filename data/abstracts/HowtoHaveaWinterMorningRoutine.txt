Figure out what time you need to wake up in the morning.
Set an alarm for 15 minutes before your decided time.
Consider taking a warm shower to give you energy.
Select your outfit for the day.
Get dressed and work your way to the kitchen.
Consider have a mug of hot chocolate, tea, apple cider, or coffee to relax your body and bring you warmth.
Have a wonderful winter morning and rest of the day!

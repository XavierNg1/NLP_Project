Don't use $'s anymore!,
Look up and use a slash symbol directive for any symbols that need displaying.
Use \frac{}{} directive to format any fractions in the equation
Example:
\begin{document}
\(K=\frac{1}{2}mV^{2}\)
\end{document}

,
Use _{} directive for subscripts and ^{} directive for superscripts.
Format away!

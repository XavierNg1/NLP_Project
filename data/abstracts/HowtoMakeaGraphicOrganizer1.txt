Draw a circle on a blank piece of paper.
Draw a second circle that overlaps the first in the middle of the paper.
Ensure that there is enough space to write on the far sides of both circles and where they overlap in the middle.
Use the Venn diagram for comparing and contrasting two things.
Contrast the two things in the outer circles and compare them in the middle overlap.

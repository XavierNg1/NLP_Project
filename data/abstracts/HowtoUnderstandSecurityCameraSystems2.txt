Use pre-cut cable or spools or 500 or 100 foot (152.4 or 30.5Â m) combo video (BNC Connection) / Power RG59 Siamese Coax Cable.
Designate one location for your DVR and Monitor to be stationed and be sure you have enough wire to connect the DVR to the camera (leave some slack).
If you purchased a pre-made RG59 cable with the BNC connections already attached to the line, then at this point you would connect it to the DVR.

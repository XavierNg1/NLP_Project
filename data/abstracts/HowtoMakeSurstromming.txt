Buy fresh herring during the traditional months of May and June.
Brine the herring for a day.
Decapitate and clean the herring.
Put the decapitated, cleaned fish into a barrel, leaving an inch for any gas to escape without causing an explosion.
Leave it out in the sun for 24 hours to begin the fermentation process.
Reserve about 5 quarts of brine and pour off the rest.
Move it indoors to a cool, dark place to let the fermentation continue until mid-August.
Finished.

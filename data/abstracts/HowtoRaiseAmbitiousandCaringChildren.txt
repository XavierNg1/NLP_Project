Live by example.
Listen to your children, what they say, and feel.
Watch what they pay attention to the most.
Show interest by investing time and money.
Ask them to meditate (think, ponder, use their imagination) on what they would like to become or be one day.
Never, never, never, tell you child they can't do something.
Please, please, please, don't live through your child, by living out your dreams.
Never pass down ignorance or wrong information from previous generations.
Take care what you tell your kids.
Watch their company.
Train your children the right way and allow them to make mistakes.

Plan for plenty of time between connecting flights.
Try to make your reservations far enough in advance so you can get an aisle seat.
Use easy-to-wheel, compact luggage.
Place these essentials in your checked luggage: Rubber or plastic shower mat (so you don't slip in the shower); hot water bottle (so you can get warm quickly if the heat in your room in inadequate); tea bags, nuts, crackers; water heater (immersible "water heater") and cup; collapsible cane with reflective tape around it (use it if you need to cross streets without a signal; drivers will expect you to walk slowly if they see you have a cane ); pillowslip (to use if the hotel pillowslip smells so strongly of bleach or cigarette smoke that it irritates your eyes); flashlight (to put beside your bed to use if you wake up at night and to carry if you are going to be walking in unlit or poorly lit areas at night).

,
Check as much as possible to avoid having to carry items.
Assume that you will get no edible food on the plane and that you will not have time to buy any food in a connecting city.
Take a cotton handkerchief.
Use luggage carts and elevators whenever possible.

,
Wear shoes that have a zipper or Velcro fastener so you can easily remove them at Security Checkpoints.
Be wise to when to use the restroom on the plane.
Plan ahead if you arrive after 10:00 p.m. in your destination city.
Prepare the address for the taxi.
Try to find a hotel that has an elevator and no steps up to the front desk.

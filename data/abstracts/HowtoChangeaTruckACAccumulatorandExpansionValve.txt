Check your local laws to make sure it is legal for a non-certified individual to do this type of work.
Make sure changing the accumulator is necessary.
Buy the needed parts.
Remove or discharge any remaining refrigerant from the AC system.
Remove the pressure sensor connector from the accumulator.
Loosen the inlet and outlet couplings on the accumulator.
Loosen the clamp or support device that secures the accumulator in position.
Loosen the fittings that join the high pressure refrigerant line near where it enters the bottom of the evaporator coil.
Look for a plastic (usually) tab just inside the tubing leading into the evaporator coil housing.
Blow out the evaporator coils with compressed air or compressed nitrogen to make sure no oil or debris is clogging them.

,
Install the new expansion valve, the tapered end with an o ring should go in toward the evaporator coils.
Install the new accumulator into its mounting bracket or support.

,
Install the pressure sensor in the new accumulator.
Install new o rings on the refrigerant line fittings on the accumulator, then reconnect the fittings and tighten them securely.
Use a vacuum pump to evacuate the air conditioning system so no moisture remains in it.
Attach a refrigerant charging hose to a can of refrigerant, puncture the can (follow the instructions on the can if using 12 oz cans that require it), vent the air from the hose, and make sure the fittings are not leaking.

,
Start the engine and turn the AC on high cool and high fan.Test all fittings for leak using a foaming soap mixture, clean up, and dispose of old parts and cleaning products safely.

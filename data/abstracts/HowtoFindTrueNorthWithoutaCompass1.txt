Place a stick upright in the ground so that you can see its shadow.
Mark the tip of the shadow with a small object, such as a pebble, or a distinct scratch in the ground.
Wait 10-15 minutes.
Mark the new position of the shadow's tip with another small object or scratch.
Draw a straight line in the ground between the two marks.
Stand with the first mark (west) on your left, and the other (east) on your right.

Gather your materials.
Measure the V. An easy way to do this is to use a V-necked shirt that you like as a guide.
Fold your crew-neck shirt vertically.
Trace the V. Place a ruler in a diagonal line from the the point where the shoulder seam meets the collar down to the middle of the chest.
Remove the stitches.
Smooth the crew-neck shirt out on the table.
Cut out the V-neck.
Cut the front of the detached crew collar in the center.
Stretch each side of the cut collar along the length of your V-neck.
Pin the rough edge of the collar to the shirt.
Sew from the top of the collar down to the bottom of the V. Sew approximately a quarter inch (0.6 cm) from the edge of the two layers.When you sew down the second side of the collar, stop just a little before you get to the V and sew that end to the back of the first side.

Understand that ants/spiders usually try to escape if they are in milk or water.
Put something in the water to rescue the ant/spider.
Drain the liquid -slowly!,
Let it crawl a little.
Introduce an absorbent material like a terrycloth towel and place it near the ant.
Place the absorbent material next to the ant.
That's all that can be done.
A successful scenario is when there is no liquid around the ant and the ant is able to move freely.

,
Place it where you found it (on the table where the cup or bowl was) so that it can find it's way home.

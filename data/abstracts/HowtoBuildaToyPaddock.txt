Get some hard board, wood or even cardboard, about 24 inches by 17 inches(61cm by 43cm) if you are using a Schleich horse, fairly bigger if using a Breyer, also consider the amount of horses you have and adjust the size to fit your requirement, although this will hold about 4 Schleich figurines comfortably.
Next, you need some long pieces of wood preferably quite thin and in small strips.
If not making a gateway, ignore this step and go straight below.
With wood glue, glue the pieces of wood to the side of your paddock.
Now collect some AstroTurf ,fake grass, and use that as your horse's grass, this can be found on websites such as amazon.
Finally, watch your horse enjoy his/her new home!

Heterocyclic organic chemistry is a branch of organic chemistry that deals with the chemistry of cyclic organic compounds which contain a heteroatom as one of the atoms in its structure.
This collection of heteroatoms that can participate in the formation of the heterocyclic ring make these structures very versatile in its chemical behavior.
The insertion of a foreign atom into a cyclic organic compound is a synthetically challenging task for the practitioner chemist.
Besides electronic and spectroscopic properties of heterocyclic compounds can be very interesting to study and to evaluate based on its applications in many types of industries.
Heterocyclic organic compounds have an interesting group of compounds which are called the aromatic heterocyclic compounds.
Aromatic compounds are organic cyclic compounds which have unusual thermodynamic stability that is conferred due to the presence of three conjugated double bonds in its molecular structure.
The synthesis of heterocyclic organic compounds is mainly by the process of cyclization of a linear compound that includes a heteroatom in its structure.
This area of organic chemistry is a relatively new to the chemical science and there is still an actively ongoing research that is done on these compounds and its derivatives.
The nature of the heteroatom that is incorporated into the ring can dictate its level of application and degree of toxicity.

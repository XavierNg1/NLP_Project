Know that DIY fixes may void your warranty.
Sand away the soft felt around your leak if it is on the top of the mattress.
Cut out a square of thin, malleable plastic, like a shower curtain.
Attach the DIY patch with strong glue.
Press your patch into the glue and hold it there.
Place a heavy object on top of the patch and return in 6-8 hours.

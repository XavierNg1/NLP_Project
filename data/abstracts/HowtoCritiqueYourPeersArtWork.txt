Get your group together.
Hang the work evenly, tack all curling corners down, make sure nothing is in a shadow, or partially hidden.
Always begin with a positive statement about the work.
Try to indicate one or two things that jump out that aren't working, could use improvement, refining or changing.
Become a more savvy and informed viewer of art.
Refer to the Elements of Design in talking about a piece:


Form/Shape, such as geometric or free form.
Refer to the Principles of Design and how they are used in the piece:


Alteration, repeating in a definite pattern, like wall paper,
Balance, formal and informal,
Contrast/Conflict, refers to "the opposite of" such as light/dark, rough/smooth, soft/hard, etc.
If you have a question, begin by asking the group to focus on it.
Be open to the thoughts and ideas generated, but don't let others' opinions deflate your enthusiasm.
Be silent.
Get past the fear of hard work, sometimes, especially with watercolor, you will need to do the piece again.
Pay close attention and you will learn almost as much from what is said about others' work as your own.

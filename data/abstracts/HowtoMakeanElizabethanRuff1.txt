Measure the wearer’s neck.
Fold each end of the cut ribbon by an inch.
Pleat the wired ribbon at 1 inch intervals.
Use a pencil or dowel to create nice, even round pleats.
Sew the 1” wide ribbon on top of the pleats.
Don’t worry if the wire pops out.
Fold the last bit of wired ribbon under, as you did at the beginning of the process.
Sew 12 to 18 inches of narrow ribbon or cord to each end of the ruff.
Maintain the ruff.

Start by brushing out your hair.
Tame the frizz using serum (optional).
Pull your hair back into a tight ponytail.
Hold all of your hair by the bottom and twist your hair into one giant twist.
Wrap the twisted ponytail around the base, where the ponytail is.
Add bobby pins or wrap another bobble around it.
Spray your hair with some water to calm down the fly-aways (just a dab of conditioner can do just fine for dry hair too).
Tug on the sides.
Optionally, you can add a headband.

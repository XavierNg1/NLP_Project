Concentrate your efforts for learning--but if your friends don't want to learn, casually leave them behind without creating a scene as you don't want to make enemies of them.
Start hanging around with people that want to learn (who are sometimes referred to as "nerds") as they may influence you to form better study habits and perform well in class.
*"Nerds", as you call them are just students who know where their priorities are.
Focus in school.
*Maybe you have a dream.
Continue the process.

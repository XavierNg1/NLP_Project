Set up a good studying area.
Use different books for every subject so you do not get confused.
Make planners.
Take notes in everything.
Ask yourself questions on what you are reading.
If you do not like studying, give yourself goals or rewards for doing study.
If you really don't like the subjects, turn Science to Potions or maybe Maths to Arithmancy.

Know a little random knowledge.
Don't cuss.
Don't assume that, because a geek spends 4+ hours on a computer daily, can Photoshop stuff, uses good grammar and has a 70 wpm typing speed, that they can't socially interact.
Don't assume that glasses/braces=geek.
If the geek is busy, don't interrupt.
Geeks are human.
If you want to befriend a geek or friend-friend a geek, this is fine too.
BE NICE.

Get into the right mindset.
Read the play, or at least a summary.
Get used to the old-fashioned language.
Examples: "For in my sight, she uses thee kindly, but thou liest in thy throat.",
Familiarize yourself with stylistic means used in poetry, like similes, oxymorons, metaphors etc.
If you're performing Shakespeare, be sure to enunciate (speak out entire words rather than a slur of words).
When performing, remember that your character is an actual person with actual feelings, not a fancy-talking English person.

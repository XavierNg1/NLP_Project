Write the query to retrieve the raw data – Use “AdventureWorks” database for the following example.
Run the query and ship the results - SQL Server (since 2005) has a stored procedure to send emails directly from the database.
Consider sending them in HTML.
Now you can add styling to the html you already have in the stored procedure in this way (see image).
Schedule it and see it work - Since this a simple query it can be included in any SQL job.

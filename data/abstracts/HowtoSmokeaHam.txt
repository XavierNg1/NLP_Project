Mix up your curing brine.
Put your meat into a brining bag.
When the curing brine is cool, transfer it to the brining bag.
Brine your ham in a cool place for 1 day for every 2 pounds of meat.
After the recommended curing time, rinse the ham off under cold water.
Set the ham down on a grated screen to drain for 24 hours.
Make your glaze.
Turn your smoker on and get it steady at 250° F (121° C).
Smoke the ham at 250° F (121° C) for the first two hours.
After two hours, turn the heat up to 325° F (163° C).
During the final hour of the smoke, apply the glaze to the ham liberally every 15 minutes.
Remove the ham from the smoker when the internal temperature at the deepest part of the ham reaches 165° F (74° C).
Serve immediately, or store.

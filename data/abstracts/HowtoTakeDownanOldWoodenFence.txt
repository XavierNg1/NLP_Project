Determine if you have the legal right to dismantle the fence.
Decide if you want to keep the fence posts; if they are in good condition and you plan to replace your old fencing, you can remove the old fencing but still salvage the posts:


Use a chain saw to cut through each section of the fence; make a vertical cut alongside each fence post the section is attached to.
Remove fence post concrete footings.
Remove fence posts that arenâ€™t set in concrete by wiggling them back and forth until they are loose enough to pull out of the ground.

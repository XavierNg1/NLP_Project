Find a torch (flashlight) that emits a white light.
Decide what color you want your light saber to be and get cellophane of that color.
Get a few pieces of clean, white paper.
Wrap one piece of paper around the top or the torch or flashlight.
Wrap another piece of paper into a roll.
Check that it's sitting straight and is firmly taped together.

Lay out the materials.
Drill a hole into the tip of each egg half, excluding one "long" egg half.
Drill two holes as shown in the "long" half set aside for the head.
Cut a string at least 5 feet (1.5m) long (this is the spinal string).Snake Puppet Step 5.jpg|center]],
String together the rest of the snake body:


Use one bead before each "short" half, and two beads before each "long" half.
Complete the body after you have reached a desirable length:


String a few extra beads after the last egg half.
Make the control rods.
Lay out the snake body and both rods, as shown.
Cut a string at least 3' (.9m) long.
Connect the body to the control rod A by threading it through the hole.
Connect the next 3 body strings:


Line up the next control hole with the body, and tie a string as before to the body itself.
Spread hot glue onto the back of one googly eye using a hot glue gun.
Cut a string at least 6' (1.8m) long.
Tie each end of the string to the outermost hole of control rod B, so that the head hangs in the center of a triangle.
Dab hot glue over the holes in the head to secure the head string.
Finished!

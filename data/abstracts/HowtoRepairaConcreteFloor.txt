Determine the scope of the problem.
Use a ruler to determine the length and width of the area to be repaired if the condition does not define itself.
Chip the surface of the concrete to remove any high material, and to create a rough surface for the repair cement mixture to bond to.
Clean the dust and debris from the area you have chipped.
Mix the cement/sand material you will use to fill in the area you have chipped out.
Add a latex or polymerized liquid bonding agent to the dry sand/cement mixture, using enough to thoroughly wet the material and bring it to a stiff, plastic consistency.
Wet the area where the patch is to be applied with clean, fresh water.
Scoop some of your cement mixture out of your mixing container with a bull-nosed pointing trowel (or other suitable tool).
Level the surface of the wet cement with the trowel, leaving it slightly higher than the adjacent edges, to allow for settling and shrinkage.
Trowel the area with a steel finishing trowel when the patch material has become stiff.
Give the area another hour or two so that it sets up, or becomes hard, then finish trowelling it.
Clean your tools, and remove any excess material.

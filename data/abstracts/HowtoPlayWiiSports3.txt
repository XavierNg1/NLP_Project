Baseball can be a little challenging.
Swing right as the ball is at the edge of the green.
Don't swing at a ball if it goes away from the strike zone.

There are four different pitch types: Fastball, curveball, screwball, and splitter.
Pitching is easy.
The faster you pitch, the further the ball will go if hit.

Preheat oven to 175C (350F).
In a medium bowl, sift together the flour and cocoa powder.
In a large heatproof bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar.
Whisk constantly so the eggs donâ€™t curdle and scramble, until they are just lukewarm to the touch, about 5 minutes.
Beat on high speed until the mixture has cooled, tripled in volume, and looks like softly whipped cream.
Sift about one-third of the flour mixture over the eggs and fold it in gently.
Fold in half the remaining flour, then fold in the rest.
Bake until the cake shrinks back slightly from the edges of the tin and the top springs back when lightly pressed, about 20-25 minutes.

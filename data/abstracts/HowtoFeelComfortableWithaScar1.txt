Ask yourself if you’re ready to expose your scar.Exposing your scars to the world is not a necessary step toward being comfortable with your scar.
Don’t focus on people who stare.
Realize that your physical body is only one part of you.Beauty has many aspects.
Embrace your scar.Use the scar as a reminder of the pain you survived.

First off, practice, practice, practice!,
Be sure you are ready for this.
Train on playing fast hammer-ons and pull-offs (you don't have to be amazing).
Collect and save up Star Power phrases from the parts before the solo and fast strumming for the hardest triplet part.
Go into practice and try to get the fast strum riff before the solo down.
When the triplet solo comes, keep your first finger on the note closest to the green note every set of different triplets (beginning of solo A) you come across.
Try strumming the first note in every triplet if you can't tap them (or just try to alt strum).
Be ready for the "snake" pattern in Solo B!,
Survive the rest of the strums to achieve victory.

Congratulations, you are now ready to beat "One"!

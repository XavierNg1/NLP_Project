Choose an eyebrow pencil and powder that is similar to your natural coloring.
Dust the area with translucent powder.
Use eyebrow powder or eyeshadow and a stiff, angled makeup brush to etch the shape of your brow.
Use a very sharp eyebrow pencil and begin drawing little hairs in gentle, upward strokes.
Set your eyebrows by dusting again with translucent powder.For extra staying power, use a makeup sealer or lacquer that will protect your brows from moisture and from your own hands (it would be a shame to accidentally wipe off all your hard work).

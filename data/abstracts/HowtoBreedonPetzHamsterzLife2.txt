Be sure they're happy.
Go on your DS and change the date twenty-one days forward.
On the cages screen, click a hamster's cage and click the Menu button.
Let them get used to you.
Make sure to have them play together everyday.
In a few days, to a week, you go to the pet store and right away, the manager will tell you that the female's pregnant and in a week, to ten days, there will be a baby.
Congrats on the baby, and good luck!

Give up the belief that you have to be perfect.
Visualize the outcome you want.People who fear public speaking visualize their upcoming speaking opportunities as abysmal failures.
Prepare Positively.Stop worrying about yourself and get excited about your subject!,
Love your listeners.Once, just before I was about to speak to classroom of 70 students, a colleague asked me, "How can you be so confident will all those people judging you and finding fault with you?",
Put the past behind you—at least the ugly parts.Some people have speaking anxiety because of some humiliating incident of the past—often in childhood.
Get some rest and avoid hassles.Plan ahead and get a good night's sleep before your presentation.
Avoid mood-altering substances.Some people mistakenly think that drinking lots of coffee or alcohol, smoking cigarettes or popping a tranquilizer before speaking will improve their delivery.
Look your best.Take some time with your appearance.
Remember to breathe.Anxiety tightens the muscles in the chest and throat.
Focus on friendly faces.While speaking, maintain eye contact with your listeners.
It's ironic that some people are more afraid of public speaking than of driving on the highways.

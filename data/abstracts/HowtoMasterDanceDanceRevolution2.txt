Choose your song wisely.
Recognize that different songs can have a different tempo.
Vary your selection.
Use your knees to bounce with the character on the screen, or as the lights flash on the machine.
Don't return to the middle!,
Use both feet!,
Learn to shift your weight as you step.
When you first try it for the first time, try taping yourself.
Do not learn to play just one song perfectly to show off!

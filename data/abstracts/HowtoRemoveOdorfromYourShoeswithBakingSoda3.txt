Find two socks that you no longer use.
Fill each sock with 1 to 2 tablespoons of baking soda.
Tie the ends of the socks off with a piece of string or ribbon.
Tuck each sock into the toe area of each shoe.The baking soda will absorb all of those nasty odors from your shoe, but the socks will help keep them clean.
Leave the socks in the shoes overnight.
Take the deodorizers out and wear your shoes.

Use a BBQ grill with a lid.
Place the coal into the grill on the vented side grill at the bottom of the grill.
Once the coals are lit and the fire has died down, wait for the coals to be smoky white.
Put a slab of ribs, rib side down.
Close the lid and leave closed.
Time to test.
Close the lid and open all the vents on the grill (careful not to burn your fingers).
You will have to watch the ribs for at this stage they may burn.
Now is a good time to have a cold drink.
As the ribs cook they will get a little charred.
Finished.

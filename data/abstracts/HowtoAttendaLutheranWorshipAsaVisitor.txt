Research the church before attending.
Read about the denomination that a particular congregation belongs to.
Look at the services they offer.
Participate in the worship service, which is called 'Divine Service'.
Understand that Lutheranism, like Catholicism, usually contains these things in their worship service:


Hymn
General confession (i.e. of sins)
A reading from 3 passages in the Bible (one from the Old Testament, one from the Epistles or Saint Paul's letters, and one from the Gospels).
Feel free to ask questions at the end.
Pick up flyers and other literature made by the church and put them to good use.
Decide.

Gather your materials.
Nail one 2 x 6 board across the bottom of two 4 x 4s.
Measure the amount of space you want between each 2 x 6 board.
Having chosen your spacing, nail another 2 x 6 onto the 4 x 4 above the previous one.
Create another section of the wall in the exact same manner.
Prop up the two walls parallel to one another and connect the back end of the bin with a perpendicular 2 x 6.
Complete the bin by placing the final boards perpendicularly across the front side.
Cover with a 9 square foot cover.
Consider making one or two more identical bins so that you can have a turning unit.

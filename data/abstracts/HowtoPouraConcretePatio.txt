Determine where you want to construct a concrete patio, how large it will be, and its exact dimensions.
Drive stakes into the corners of the patio area.
Remove all weeds, grass, roots, and topsoil from the roped off area.
Decide if you want your patio to be level with the ground or raised.
Add a layer of gravel or crushed rock to the compacted earth.
Drive stakes around the new perimeter of your patio, spaced at least 2 feet (.6 m) apart.
Cut 2x4s to make the frame.
Line the 2x4s with the string border of the patio.
Nail the 2x4 to the stakes.
Saw off tops of the stakes.
Coat the form boards with vegetable oil or a commercial releasing agent.
Mix the concrete.
Pour the concrete.
Push the concrete into all corners with a shovel.
Use a flat piece of wood or aluminum screed (a long 2x4) to level the top of the concrete.
Use a bull float to smooth the concrete surface.
Put on the finishing touches.
Let the concrete cure for at least two days.

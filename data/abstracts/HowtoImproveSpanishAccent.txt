Listen and repeat.
Pronounce all letters correctly.

,
The Enye (Ñ) makes a Nya sound as in the word: jalapeño

,
The Elle (LL) makes a ya sound as in the word: caballo

,
The Erre (RR) makes a rolled R sound, as in: Guitarra (Don't worry if this does not happen for you right away or even ever.
One R is pronounced by flicking your tongue up very quickly and slickly.The H can sometimes be silent, as in Hielo (ice) which can be pronounced Ee-el-o

,
The J and X can sometimes be pronounced as we would say the h sound.
When two vowels are right next to each other, they merge into one.
For example: "Bien" (Fine) isn't pronounced "Bee- en", it's pronounced more of "Byen".
Note: Spanish vowels are the same as English.
Find the accented syllable.
Stay motivated.

Make your ultimate (final) effort each day; not just on test day, observation or inspection day.
Be more relevant (be the head or brain, not the tail or little toe).
Be the learner who applies what you learn.
Be positive.
Find better ways to solve problems.
Engage others by their own self interest, by their purposeful sense of desperation.

Don't be a dictator, except to yourself (kick it up a notch).
Go into emergency action.
Achieve by an overcoming complacency, not doing enough... Be actuated by a feeling of near hopelessness (but get hope by getting involved).

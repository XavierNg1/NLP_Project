Choose your sweater from old worn-out clothing in your closet or buy 1 from a thrift store.
Trace a mitten pattern by putting your hand on a piece of paper.
Pin the pattern to the sweater, making sure you pin both layers.
Place the outsides of the mitten facing in while you sew them together.
Place the mittens on your sewing machine and take out matching thread.
Sew the outside again, leaving a 1/8-inch (0.3 cm) seam allowance.
Turn the mitten right side out through the bottom of the cuff.

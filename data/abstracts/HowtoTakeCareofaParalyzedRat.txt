Always see a vet.
If they have suffered an injury, you should probably restrict their movement for awhile.
Give them newspaper or cloth bedding instead of the usual chips.
Avoid wire flooring.
Make sure food and water are easy to reach.
Keep them clean.
They may recover, depending on the condition.
House them in a one-level cage.
If housing them with other rats, watch how they get along.
Watch for injuries or infection on their lower body or legs.
At the first sign of any illness (weight loss, lack of appetite, sores, sneezing, runny nose, etc), bring them to a vet.

In traffic, just keep reminding yourself that the person who just cut you off was probably having a bad day.
Be kind to the elderly.
Be generous.
Give money to homeless people, but not directly, as this could cause problems for you and more importantly, for them.
Offer to be friends to people you have known for even a short time or who you know are going through a tough time.
Kindness begins at home.
Remember you have a responsibility to society as well.
Show kindness and responsible behavior to the environment.

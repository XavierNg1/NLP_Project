Set the Preferences under the Excel menu:

In General, set R1C1 to Off and select Show the 10 Most Recent Documents .
Go to cell A8 and do Freeze Panes under the Window menu.
Create the Defined Variables Upper Section (here's a picture):

Enter the Column Formulas:

Into cell A2, input "=H2" w/o quotes.
Calculate Arc Length

Select O1 and enter Arc Length.
Create the Chart:

Because the column B y values vary between the Function and its Derivative, the chart draws lines connecting successive {x,y} pairs and so fills in the difference.See Tips below for several more example charts.
Save the upper data section that is sufficient to re-create the form, cell range A1:M7, by copying and pasting it to the Saves worksheet.

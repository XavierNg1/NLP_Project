Consult your hardware store about the condition of your redwood siding.
Wash the wood with a weak solution of tri-sodium phosphate (TSP), if it is allowed in your state.
Make sure your redwood is dry enough to absorb a little water.
Use a roller and brush to apply 1 coat of oil or alkyd-based primer.
Allow the primer to dry completely before beginning your redwood paint job.
Paint the surface of the primed wood with 2 coats of latex paint in the color of your choice.
Allow the paint to dry.

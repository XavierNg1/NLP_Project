Before relying on a game theory decision, make a decision based on what information you have such as: the kick returner is at his top form today, or we should do an onside kick because the linemen are in (the hands and speed players are not in).
Decide to use a game theory approach.
Abstain from using the formation onside kick and use the surprise (no formation) onside kick to avoid telegraphing.

,
Quantify the directions, in this case "might" try an onside kick.
Use your wristwatch's (or a wall clock) second hand as a randomizing device.

,
Divide the 12 numbers on the watch into two: the first set of numbers is from 1 to 50 seconds and the second set from 51 to 60.
Assign 60% to your watch, like this: Do an onside kick if, when you suddenly look at your watch the second hand on 1 to 30 seconds (6/10 of the way through the first set).
The decision making will be instantaneous after looking at your watch just once.
If you do not understand, go through this second football example.

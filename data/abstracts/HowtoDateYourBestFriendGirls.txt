If you don't want to date him, then tell him.
If you do want to date your best friend, then tell him straight away!,
Talk about where you'd like to go, and try to avoid the "Where do you wanna go?",
Once you've decided about where you'd like to go with your guy, don't immediately tell all of your friends.
Pick out something to wear a few days before, and make sure it's something comfortable, but a little bit more dressy.
On the day of your date, make sure you're relaxed enough to be around him.
If he's your friend, he should have already met your parents.
On your date, to show him that you really like him, talk about slightly more personal things than you would usually talk about.
Touch him more than you usually do.
The first kiss.
Leave him some special message after the date, to know that he's secure in your affections.
After the first date, one or two more dates is great, but not necessary, and then the group situation has to happen.

Be Honest, If it's 9's to you, and you play 4's, even though you have some 9's, you've just created a potential crisis for yourself, which you could have easily avoided by simply telling the truth.
Arrange your cards, not from A to K, but in the order that the various values are going to come to you.
With different numbers of players, of course, the sequence is different.
When you have to lie, choose the card that comes latest in the sequence.
Okay, so you're going to play A's.
If someone has just played their last card, you should call BS unless you're 100% sure they're telling the truth.
If you follow this strategy, hopefully you will BE the person laying down your last card.
If you have all four of a kind, try to slip in a fifth card that you won't need (see step 2).
If you know you're about to be dead, and the pile is large and messy, try to stick the card in between some other cards in the pile so that if someone BS's you and turns over the top card, you can proclaim that they messed up the order, and that your card's in there.
If you're playing with noobs, and one of them catches you, laugh and make a smug face while pushing the cards towards them.
Always keep your cards in a way so that other people can't tell how many cards you have.
If the pile is big, and you have very little chance of getting away with a cheat, call cheat before your turn comes up on someone you think might be cheating.
Maintain a constant expression throughout the game.

,
If you are playing with people new to the game, try this for the first few times: when the pile is big, and you have the right card, make a very tiny smile or some other suspicious expression when putting down your card.
Always know what card you need next and if you have it.
If it is your turn to play a jack and you have a jack, you can play it and say, "One eleven, I mean jack."

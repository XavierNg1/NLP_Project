Discuss the animal in question with your child.
Research the different possibilities together with your child.
Read up on whichever pet you both decide on, before you buy it.
Set limits and rules regarding the care of the pet ahead of time.
Discuss your budget before you walk into the shop - there are SO MANY fun things for pets available, that your excited child will want to buy all of them.

,
Examine the animals' condition in the store:


Do all of the animals for sale look healthy?,
Leave the shop and try another location, if you see any signs of illness or poor care.
Explain that the store only had sick pets, and that you will go immediately to one that has happy, healthy animals.

,
Better yet, do not go to a traditional pet store at all.
Let your child choose the appropriate accessories and the actual animal him/herself.
Help set everything up once you get home, and make sure the cage (if there is one) is assembled properly.

Enjoy watching you child's first steps toward growing and learning new skills.

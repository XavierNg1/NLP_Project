Decide on the pub you are going to go to regularly.
Pick a relatively quiet time to visit when sitting on your own would not look too out of place.
Take something to occupy yourself, such as a exciting,good and big book or a interesting newspaper on these off times.
Engage the bar staff in conversation if they are not too busy.
Take the first step and introduce yourself to a group of people at the bar.
Be willing to discuss the "best-of" spots around town.
Keep the conversation light-hearted, and friendly until a bond is built with some of the locals.

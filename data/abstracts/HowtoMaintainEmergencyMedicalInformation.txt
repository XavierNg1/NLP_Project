Prepare a quick emergency medical information list in the way that will most maximize your chances of getting good treatment.
Identify your primary care practitioner, or PCP.
Where to turn should questions arise about your wishes.
Keep the information list brief, but as detailed as possible.
Keep the information on your person at all times.
A simple way is to print out a page from on your home computer with all the necessary information and either:


Keep a print-out of the information in your wallet/purse.
Keep the information list up-to-date.
Consider ensuring that all family members have recorded their emergency medical information in the same way.

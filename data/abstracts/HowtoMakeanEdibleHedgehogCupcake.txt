Take the dessert cup.
Coat the entire whipped cream surface with brown frosting, M&M's, and/or sprinkles.
Now make the "spikes".
Lower, at the bottom of the dome, remove some M&M's to make a little "Mask" And put two round, black candies there for "Eyes.",
Under that attach the cone shape.
At the very bottom of the cup, slice and attach licorice to make "Paws".
Put your masterpiece into the middle of a blank cake, or serve on it's own!

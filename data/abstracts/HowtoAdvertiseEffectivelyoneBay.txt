Put yourself in the buyer's shoes.
Be honest, be accurate.
Provide all necessary information, including condition, age, brand names and all relevant info.
Provide photos.
Consider adding voice and video to your listings.
Do your research.
Never assume the buyer is an expert and will "automatically find" your item.
Use the right keywords.
Look at completed auctions for similar items and see what titles and keywords caught bidders' eyes and got the highest bids.
Group ads for similar items in the same week and stagger the starting times by a day or two.

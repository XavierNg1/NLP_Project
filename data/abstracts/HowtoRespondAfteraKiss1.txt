Enjoy the moment slowly, without worrying about next steps.
Ease back out of the kiss, keeping yourself close to your partner's face.
Look your partner in the eyes and smile.
Try not to force in any lines, quotes, or jokes to break the awkwardness.
Continue building your relationship after your first kiss.

Realize that you have options when it comes to investing in the bond market.
Research which type of bond is right for you.
Realize that while your money is out of your hands for a much longer period, the long-term maturities will provide a higher rate of return and will increase in value over this time.
Evaluate your portfolio often.
Keep your eye on your long-term maturities as well.
Start your barbell strategy with a 50-50 split between long-term and short-term maturities.
Remember that longer-term bond prices normally decline whenever prevailing rates are rising.

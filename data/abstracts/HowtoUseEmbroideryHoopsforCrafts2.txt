Use the embroidery hoop as your "loom".
Cut the sleeves of an old T-shirt into half-inch to one-inch-wide loops.
Stretch the loop one by one over the embroidery hoop, spacing them evenly.
Attach the first weft by looping it over a warp and then through itself.
Connect another weft or two using the same method - looping them through the previous weft and through themselves.

,
Begin weaving the weft over and under, forming a tight spiral.
Continue weaving and adding wefts.
When the basket is the desired size, cut you last weft loop.
Cut the warps one at a time.

Check out a job chart for Sims 3.
Decide whether you want to be self-employed, have a profession or have a job.
Think about your sims lifetime wish, for example if your sim wants to be a "world renowned surgeon" you might want to get them to join the "medical career".
When you first move in your Sim, he/she will probably want a job that fits with his or her traits.
If your Sim doesn't have a trait that would influence a career, like neat, choose a job that is interesting to you, or maybe one you haven't tried before!.
Make sure to show up at work in a good mood.

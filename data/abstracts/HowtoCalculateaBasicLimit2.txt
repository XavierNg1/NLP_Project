Plug in infinity (∞) or negative infinity (-∞) into the equation.
Simplify the equation to get a real answer.
If there's a limit where x goes to infinity, an alternate method is to only consider the term with the highest power in both the numerator and the denominator, and ignore all the other terms, then use the simplified version of the limit to work with.

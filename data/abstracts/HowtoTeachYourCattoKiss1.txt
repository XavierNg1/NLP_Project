Make sure your cat is hungry.
Ask a friend to sit a few feet away from the cat.
Apply some cat food on your friend’s cheek.
Let the cat go to your friend.
Say the command “Kiss!” You should time this so that the cat is “kissing” (licking) your friend’s face at the same time that you give the “kiss” command.
Repeat this process a number of times.

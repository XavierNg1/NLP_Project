Choose a bottle that is right for your creation.

Assemble the tools.

Create the scenery base.

Make a swab tool.

As you add clay logs, flatten them using a tool that can take some pressure.

Create a clean-looking layer of black in the shape of the landscape, that acts as a visual barrier, and which can be filled with more Apoxie or other materials.

Use a cardboard dummy of the bridge to help with the planning of the Apoxie scenery base as it is built up.

Build the arch from styrene strips.

Make the road deck from styrene sheet and strips.
,

To make sure that the bridge has a correctly-shaped contour to sit on once it is inserted in the bottle, create a pair of step-forms from square styrene tubing.

Cement the step-forms into the landscape using Apoxie.

With the landscape in its near-final shape, and with the step-forms in place, add the color and texture needed to bring the scene to life.

Insert the bridge in two sections.

Securely attach the bents and arch to the scenery using dabs of Apoxie clay.

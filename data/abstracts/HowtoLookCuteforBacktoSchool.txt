Make sure you have a great outfit.
Get your nails done.
Today's the day!,
Shower and wash your hair.
Eat, wash your face and brush your teeth.

,
Blow dry your hair.
Style your hair and put on light makeup.
Put on your outfit and add accessories.
Put on perfume and breath spray.
Having confidence in yourself makes you more pretty than makeup or cute clothes ever will.

,
Add your own things to make you, you.
It's time to go.

Do not roll a bag if it comes with a stuff sack and space is no issues.
Lay the sleeping bag on a flat, dry surface.
Zip up the bag and push any large air pockets out through the head.
Fold the sleeping bag in half lengthwise.
Start rolling upwards, firmly, from the feet.
Sit on the bag with your knees to keep it tight.
Use the attached straps to keep the bag rolled.
Keep the bag dry and free from water.

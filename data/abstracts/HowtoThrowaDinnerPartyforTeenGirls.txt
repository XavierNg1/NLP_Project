Make a guest list.
Be sure to include all the information on the invitation.
Now the fun part: the menu!,

It's a few days until the party.
Have your family get involved!,
Wear something nice and fancy, like a party dress.
If you want, hand out "goodie bags" when guests are leaving.
Help with the clean up!

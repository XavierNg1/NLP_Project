Measure your dog from paw to shoulder, then subtract 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters).
Choose your base according to the measurement you just took.
Choose a rimmed bowl.
Measure the inside diameter of the bowl, then draw a circle using a compass according to that measurement.
Drill a small hole inside the circle that you drew, as close to the edge as you can.
Use a jigsaw to cut the circle out.
Sand any jaggedness away, if desired.
Vacuum up any dust, then wipe everything down with a damp cloth.
Paint the base with a coat of primer, then wait for the primer to dry.
Paint the base, then wait for the paint to dry.
Consider adding some design.
Coat the base with a sealer, then let it dry.
Set your dog's bowl into the hole and fill it with food.

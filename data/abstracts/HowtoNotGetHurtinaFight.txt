Recognize aggressive behavior.
Be ready.
When they come at you, the first thing you want to do is take a step back and put your hands up.
Don't attack unless there's an opening.
When you block, punish them.
Bob and weave.
If they're bigger and stronger than you, it's most likely they'll try to grapple with you.
When they've had enough, don't keep beating on them, no matter how tempting it is.

Begin introducing "academic" activities to your children as early as 2 years old.
When your children begin receiving homework from school -- most likely during Kindergarten -- instruct them to set aside time right arriving home from school to complete their work.
When your children begin developing independence, pull back a little from your involvement in work time.
When your children are in 8th grade or high school, reduce your reminders of work time, and see how your children respond.
As your children are exposed to more and more difficult material, teach them effective study strategies for dealing with the new workload.
Even when your children are in high school and should be managing their own work, ask about upcoming projects/tests and inquire about their plan for completing them.

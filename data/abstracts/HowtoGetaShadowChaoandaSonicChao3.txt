The Sonic Chao is a neutral Chao, so to get one you have to either A) Pet it equally with both Sonic and Shadow or B) Get it so that it looks like it will be a Shadow Chao and then pet and feed it its favorite fruit only with a Hero Character.

,
People have often said that if you give your Chao any other Chaos Drives,or Animals then it will not become a Shadow or Sonic Chao, this is false.
Do all the steps for Sonic but use a shiny yellow Chao or Gold Chao and when it evolves the second time give it some power drives too, but also give it more run drives.

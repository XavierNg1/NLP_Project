Accept yourself.
Count your blessings.
Turn negative self-talk into encouragement.
Drop past resentments.Regrets and resentments block us from being able to handle the present with ease.
Keep positive influences close.
Take life a little less seriously.Much of the time that life feels difficult to deal with, it is because we are putting ourselves to the task of dealing.

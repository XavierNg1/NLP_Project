Gather Your Materials Grab a big square of fabric that you don't particularly care about (if it gets destroyed by your kitty).
Start Working Fold your fabric in a place where the edges line up fairly well.
Filling If you prefer to leave a nice clean edge on your toy, turn it inside-out so the fringe won't show.
Sewing Shut Now, with all the fillings inside of the toy, sew the opening shut.
Playtime.

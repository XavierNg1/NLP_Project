If your opponent agrees to the play, the value of the cards is added up and the player with the most points wins the "Envido.",
When the round ends, if the "Envido" play was accepted, whoever wins the most points should show the cards that make up his "Envido.",
To add up card values:

If you have two cards of the same suit that aren't 10s, 11s, or 12s, add them up and add 20.
"Envido" should be called out before the end of Phase 1.
In general, the "Envido" is called by the "foot" of each team.
Once the opposing team has agreed to the "Envido" with the word "Quiero," the play is automatically over.

Pick someone to 'fall in love' with.Your person should be someone relatively good looking- you want to pick someone who other people will believe you'd fall in love with.
Think only of the person's good attributes, and ignore the bad ones.
Act happier when that person is around.
Draw more attention to yourself when that person is around.
Act like you would if your relationship was real.
Let the relationship go on for as long as you absolutely need it to, then end it immediately.

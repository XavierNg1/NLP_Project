Consider your supplies.
Look at the abilities of the whole team.
Plan your tactics.
Gather the squad going in to the territory.
Have a few people cause a diversion further down the border.
Dodge all defenders in the territory.
Once within the range of the base, try to take out the main defense points.
Get in and storm the base.
Get to the leader's area, and if they are still there, take them hostage and report back to your base.
If the leader is not still there, send out a squad to find them.

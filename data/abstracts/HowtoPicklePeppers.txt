Select peppers that are crisp and fresh.
Purchase 7 to 9 pounds of peppers to fill a canner load of 9 pint jars.
Wash your peppers.
Slice your peppers in half and remove the cores and seeds.
Remove the skins from your peppers by 'blistering' them.
Place the blistered peppers in a pan.
Gently pull the blistered skin off of the peppers.
Prepare the pickling juice.
Bring the pot to a boil.
Remove the garlic cloves once the mixture has simmered for 10 minutes.
Wash the jars you will be using to keep your pickled peppers.
Put the jars upside down in a large pot of boiling water about 2 to 3 inches high (5.1 to 7.6cm), then turn down the heat.
Place the jar seals and rings in a smaller pot of hot, simmering water.

,
Place peppers into jars so that they are loose and not tightly packed.
Pour the pickling liquid over the peppers.
Eliminate bubbles of air by stirring each jar with a small rubber spatula.
Dab the rims of each jar with a cloth or paper towel.

,
Put the seals on the jars and tighten them so that they are firmly closed, but not too tight.

,
Put each jar on the rack inside of your canner, so that they are a few inches above the water.
Add enough hot water to the canner to make sure that the bottom of each jar is covered by 2 inches of water.

,
Cover your canner with the lid and allow the water to boil again.
Remove the lid after 10 minutes and raise the rack.

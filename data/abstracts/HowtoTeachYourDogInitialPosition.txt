Use a target stick or an index finger as a target.
When you have repeated this behaviour many times with the target stick, stand in front of the dog without holding out the target stick.
Put a box on the floor between you and the dog.
The dog is standing on the box with its forelegs; Move a step to the right.
When the dog moves its hind paws reliably, you claim the dog to move 2-3 steps with its hind paws before you click.
Now you will not move and the dog is supposed to move "spontaneously".
Now you're standing next to the dog while the dog is standing on the box with its forepaws.
Remove the box and do left turns on site.
Now the dog should learn how to sit at the foot, and this is maybe the most important part of the initial position.
As soon as this work you take a step forward without holding out the target stick.
Now you should at the earliest date move away from the wall.
When the dog can offer initial position from the front, you should start to vary your own position.
When the dog is in initial position you should be able to turn both to the right and to the left, and even turn back, and then the dog is supposed to quickly sit in initial position again.

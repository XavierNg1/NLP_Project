Have a basic understanding of Excel.
Insert the following function into a blank cell where you would like your end result to appear:

=INDEX(Range,MATCH(MAX(COUNTIF(Range,Range)),COUNTIF(Range,Range),0))

To make this formula work, press Ctrl+Shift+Enter once you have entered in the above formula with your values in for the "Range".
The way the formula works is the INDEX function picks out how many different words are used.

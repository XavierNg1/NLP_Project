Moving Prep:  In transporting any pet, have your regular veterinarian do a routine checkup to update your pet’s health records for your own files and for your new pet doctor ( if your moving out of state).
Moving Day: Depending on what type of reptile you have, there will be many different procedures based on their particular species traits.
Travel by Car: Travel by car is the least stressful mode for your reptile because you can adjust the ambient temperature, time of travel, surrounding noises and have a greater variety of pet carriers to choose from for your move.
Traveling by Air: Airlines transport pets everyday and this can be a good resource/option for you to investigate.
Post Move:  As soon as you arrive at the new residence, settle your reptile into his/her new home/habitat to alleviate moving stress as quickly as possible.

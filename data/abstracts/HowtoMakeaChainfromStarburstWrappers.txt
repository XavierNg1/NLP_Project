Start collecting wrappers.
Lay one wrapper down on a table so that it is long but not tall, with the blank side facing up.








,
Fold the wrapper in half so that the bottom corners touch the top ones.








,
Do this two more times.








,
The color side of the wrapper should be visible.
Fold the wrapper in half horizontally.








,
Open it up again.








,
Fold it so that the outer edges are touching the crease.








,
Fold the wrapper in half once again.








,
Once you have made more of these, you will need to connect them.








,
Take the two ends of one wrapper and insert it into the two ends of another wrapper.
Continue this process.








,
Eventually a chain will start to form.

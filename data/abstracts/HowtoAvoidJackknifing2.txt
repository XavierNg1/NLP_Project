Be wary of light loads.
Spread your braking over the longest possible distance, braking progressively and reducing your speed gradually.
Avoid having to brake or even decelerate on a curve.
If you ever need to take avoiding action, don't brake and swerve at the same time.
Be very cautious about using your engine brake or retarder (exhaust brake / Jacobs brake / Telma / Voith etc.),
Jackknifing starts as a skid, so do your utmost to avoid skidding.
Keep both tractor and trailer properly maintained.
Modern anti-lock braking systems, first developed for aircraft to stop them skidding on the runway, are now fitted to heavy vehicles.

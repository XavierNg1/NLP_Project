Don't be nervous.
If you are going to handle a hedgehog, pick it up.
Holding your hands flat, let them unroll and get rid of the 'bedhead.',
Go ahead and let them walk around or pat them.
If you want to, let them burrow into the crook of your arm.
Some hedgehogs prefer to explore, but most love to take a nap on you while you watch TV or surf the web.Most hedgehogs shouldn't be messed with in the cage unless you're getting them out to handle or bathe; the only exception is for those hedgehogs with excellent temperaments who are not at all fearful of your presence (putting quills up, hissing, etc)

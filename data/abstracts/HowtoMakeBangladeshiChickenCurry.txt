Collect all of the spices (cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, cloves, bay leaves, and peppercorns) and set them all together to the side, as they will be added to the dish in their own step.
Collect all of the dry spices set them aside.
Wash the cucumber and dry it off with paper towels.
Peel the garlic cloves and dice them up finely.
Chop up the tomato.
Cut the ends off of the red onion and then cut it in half.

Set the stovetop burner to just under high heat and let the pot sit for 3 minutes to heat.
Pour the oil into a large metal pot that has been sitting on the burner for a few minutes.
When you can smell the lovely aroma of the whole spices toss in all of the chopped onions (red and yellow) and stir to coat with oil.
Once you see the onions have become transparent, toss in the ginger coated garlic you set aside and stir well to combine.
Once you smell the garlic become fragrant, you will then toss in all of your dry spices (coriander, chili powder, cinnamon, salt, turmeric, cumin, and bouillon cubes).
Once you let that cook down by half, add in the chicken.
At this point the rice is done.
Make sure to stir the rice up really well to incorporate all of the butter and parsley flakes throughout.
Once that the curry has cooked down again, pour in the potatoes and another 6 cups of hot water.
Finished.

Disconnect the battery from your laptop.
Pry the battery apart.
You will see 6-8 cells connected to a circuit board.
Make a note of where the wires connect to.
Use a soldering iron/electric welding tool to separate cells from the wires.
Then solder/weld the new cells together.
Put the new cells into the case.
In the end put both rows of cells back together.
Your hack is complete!

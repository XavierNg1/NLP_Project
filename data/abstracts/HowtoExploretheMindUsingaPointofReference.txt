Make your point of reference.
Learn to recognise that particular frame of mind.
Ask yourself or check often to see if you are currently in that frame of mind.
Use your point of reference as a foundation, "safe-house" or an anchor that you can return to.

,
Learn the other feelings and frames of mind by comparing them to your point of reference.
Practice returning to your frame of mind as often as possible.
Explore a chain of events or a different feeling from your point of reference.
Take it a step at a time.
When you feel confident in doing this expand it to observe everything from your "safe-house".
After you feel an ability to recognise each different frame of mind you might experience (such as anger, jealousy, generosity, virtue etc) you can select the ones you want to associate with and which ones you don't.
Use the point of reference with the aim to be able to see everything from a subtle distance.
Try and use it to improve mental health at the same time.
After that, try and see what made that frame of mind happen.

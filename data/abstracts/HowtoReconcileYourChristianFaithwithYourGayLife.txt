Rest in the Lord.
Never accept that you can lose your salvation.
Don't buy into conditional salvation.
Stand on the simplicity of Jesus Christ's completed work.
Believe.
Realize that your faith is your faith - nobody has the right to tell you that it isn't real, or that it isn't good enough.
Accept that you may need to find a new church home.
Listen critically and apply logic.
Be the gay person in their lives.
Remember that this is your Christian Walk.
Maintain your sense of humor and humility.
Remain a person of dignity, integrity,support, and faith.

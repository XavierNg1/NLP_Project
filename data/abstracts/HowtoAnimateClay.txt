Buy plasticine or polymer clay and wire at your local craft store.
Cut about a three foot piece of wire and bend it in half.
Form the wire into the general shape of the object you wish to make.
Start molding a thin layer of gray clay onto the armature or wire frame.
Create a figurine for clay animation.
Begin animating your figure.
Place the figure on a flat surface.
Move the figure very slightly into the next position, then take another picture.
Continue to move the figure and take pictures until you have completed your desired animation.
Load the pictures onto a computer.

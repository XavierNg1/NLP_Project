Purchase sunflower seeds.
Purchase or repurpose containers or pots that are suitable for growing the sunflowers in.
Put the soil into the container, pot or window/porch box.
Place the sunflower seeds in the container.
Be prepared to water sunflowers more often than many other plants.
Wait for the seeds to germinate.
If germination has been successful, then well done!,
Put the sunflower container in a nice sunny part of your house, garden or on the veranda (porch) if you prefer.
Continue to tend the plant with water and general plant care.
At this point give the sunflowers 75 milliliters (2.5  fl oz) (2.5 fl oz) of water.
Fertilize if wished.
In one month the sunflower bud should be still developing for the next two weeks (water regulation should increase to 100ml/ 3.3 fl oz of water).
Enjoy the sunflower as a decorative element in your home or wherever else you've placed the container.
If you want to make culinary use of the sunflower, the petals from the flowers make a pretty addition to salads, and both the seeds and the buds can also be eaten.

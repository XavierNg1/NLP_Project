Begin working the horse daily in a 40â€™ round pen.

,
Walk, trot and canter both directions until the horse begins to relax and give up.
Initially, for the first 3-5 days or more, the horse will not appear to relax and it means being patient and continuing to work him.
Repeat this process every day until you begin to see the signs that the horse is becoming respectful of you as the herd leader (as indicated by head position, licking lips, turning to face you when he stops, etc.).

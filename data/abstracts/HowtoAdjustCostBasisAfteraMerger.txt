Determine the original cost basis of your investment, including any commissions paid.
Find out how many fractional shares of newly issued Company B stock were sold to give you the cash-in-lieu payment, which results from sales of fractional shares you were otherwise entitled to receive, but were sold because only whole shares are issued in a corporate action.
Add the fractional share from the previous step to the number of whole shares, to determine the total number of shares you received.
Convert the total number of shares you received of the acquiring company stock to the equivalent shares of the original acquired company stock you held, using the conversion ratio according to the merger terms.
Multiply the result from the previous step by your original cost basis per share, to get the cost basis for the stock portion of the merger.
Allocate the adjusted cost basis for the stock portion into the whole share part and the fractional share part, in proportion to the number of shares in each part.
Determine taxable gains and losses by adding up the cost basis for all cash proceeds, and subtracting the result from the total cash proceeds.
Save for future reference the adjusted cost basis of the shares received.

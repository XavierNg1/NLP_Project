Find and go to local stables, local horse breeders, tack shops and even in the local newspaper or Internet that may have any advertisements or know of any horses for sale.
Try to find an older horse that already has been well-broke to the saddle (preferably a ranch-type horse).
Take a one-on-one look at the horse.
Ask if you can ride it to get a feel of how it moves under you and whether you like the feel of him between your knees.
It is also a good idea to watch it being groomed and tacked up.
Go home and think about your decision.
After you are positive that the horse is perfect for you, confirm about the price of the horse.
Take the horse home and put him in his new paddock with fresh water, hay and/or grass.

,
You may want to put him in the round pen or something similar and give him a good bit of exercise after all this.
Leave him be for a day or more until he gets totally settled in.
Contact your local large animal equestrian vet and/or the owner if your horse suddenly goes down with colic or goes off feed.

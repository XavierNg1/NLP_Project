Remember that the hand formation described in this article is different than those typically taught by most karate systems.
To avoid these problems, you should use the hand formation taught in 'Atemi Wazi' as in Judo Kodokan.
To learn this hand formation, just put your hand on the table with all your fingers together.
It will resemble the Vulcan greeting hand gesture first initiated by Mr. Spock in "Star Trek.",
Practice striking pads to build up shock resistance in the joints of the fingers.

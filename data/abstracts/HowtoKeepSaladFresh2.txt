Prepare your fruits.
Coat cut fruits in an antioxidant fruit juice.If you are using fruits in your salad that are likely to brown when exposed to air, you should protect them by tossing the cut pieces in a little lemon juice.
Submerge the fruit in cold water.Another way to preserve the freshness of cut fruit for a longer period of time is to place the fruit pieces into a plastic container and cover them with fresh, cold water.
Refrigerate the fruit salad.
Drain the water when ready to serve.
Save the dressing until the end.

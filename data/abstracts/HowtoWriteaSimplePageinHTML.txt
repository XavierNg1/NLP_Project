Basic Format


The Basic format of HTML is:<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
;
,
The first <html> tag tells the browser that this is the start of the HTML document.
Tags


HTML documents consist of tags.
The tags for an ordered list are similar, but the opening and closing tag are <ol> and </ol>
Code such as this...
<ul><li>One<li>Two<li>Three</ul><br>
is rendered by the browser like this...
One
Two
Three


Note that these are only the very basic HTML tags.
DOCTYPE


A DOCTYPE declaration is a statement at the very beginning of the document (before the <html> tag) that tells a browser what version of HTML to expect.
Most pages will work fine without a Doctype but it is a good idea to have one.
The Encapsulation Rule


All (X)HTML(referring to both XHTML and HTML) tags must be closed.
The Head


The head of the document(information between the <head> and </head> tags) is not viewable by the visitor of the page(except the title).
Comments


HTML comments, <!---...--->, are bits of information we put into the code for developer uses.

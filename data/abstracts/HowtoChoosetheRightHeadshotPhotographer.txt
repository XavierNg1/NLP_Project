Remember, money is skill.
After looking at a photographer's samples, give them a call (assuming they are in your price range).
Email to set up a time, and be sure they are responsive.
After you feel comfortable that your photographer is responsible and easy to work with, it's a good idea to see if you can meet with him or her before the session as well.
On the day of the shoot, the best thing to do is to take things lightly; don't be too worried about trying to get the perfect shot, because it will come if you give the photographer enough time.

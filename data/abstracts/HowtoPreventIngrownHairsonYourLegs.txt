Use steam to soften your skin before shaving.Tight, dry skin facilitates ingrown hair growth, so we’ll want to take steps when possible to loosen and soften it.
Don’t shave too closely.Exert less pressure and refrain from pulling your skin taut; this will leave your leg hair slightly longer, reducing the likelihood of short, sharp hairs breaking back through your skin in either direction.
Shave with the grain.
Rinse between every stroke.
Lay a cool washcloth on your leg afterward.Cool, light pressure will reduce inflammation, and contract your pores.
Wait longer between shaves.
Wear looser clothing.
Stop tweezing and waxing.
Avoid skin products with alcohol.Alcohol can cause your skin to tighten and dry out, worsening irritation.
Assuage the pain with cortisone cream or aloe vera.
Try depilatory creams instead of shaving.
Tweeze ingrown hairs out from under the skin.
Treat them with active ingredients.
Laser your leg hair.

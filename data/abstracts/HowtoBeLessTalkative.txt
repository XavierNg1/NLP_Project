Unplug from technology.
Write your thoughts in journal.If the people around you seem increasingly disinterested in what you have to say, write it down in a journal.
Meditate for self awareness.Meditation doesn’t have to be an intense yogi experience where you sit in absolute silence with your back against the wall as you "om".
Be an observer of your surroundings.
Be aware of the differences between listening and hearing.
Know that listening is all about the other person.When you quiet your talking and place less focus on bringing attention to yourself, you free your focus up to the person you’re talking to and for better listening.
Observe body language and tones.Picking up changes in baseline behavior like a person’s voice, face, or body language is something good listeners are great at doing.
Practice being accepting and non-judgmental.
Check yourself on whether or not things should be left unsaid.
Show your willingness to listen.When the other person hints that they want to talk, do something to show that they have your full, undivided attention.
Think before you respond.
Refrain from interrupting people when they talk.
Talk when it is appropriate.

We will now extend our Hello World program to take input from the user.
Import the Scanner class.
Inside our main method, instantiate a new instance of the Scanner object.
Prompt the user for an input.
Ask the Scanner object to take in the next line that the user types in and store that in a variable.
Print out a greeting to the user.
Put it all together and save.
Compile and run.

Learn to speak well.
Stop swearing.
Dress well.
Look clean and fresh looking.
Basically, wear stuff that is clean, doesn't reveal too much, fits and suits you, and isn't too harsh.
Make sure your hair is nice.. Wash your hair a couple of times a week, and use a strong and sweet smelling shampoo.

,
Don't comb/brush your hair too much, and don't use too many hair products - they damage your hair.
Medium length is quite nice, and a bob is cute and neat.
Be graceful.
AS for sports, just make sure you drink plenty of water to keep off red faces and sweat, and try your hardest.

,
Don't stuff your face with food - chew your food and don't make any noises or gulp it down.
Make sure your belongings are neat.
Always be nice and generous.
Concentrate in School.

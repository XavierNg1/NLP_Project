Expect some of your fry to not make it through the transition from a fry to a fish.One of the hardest transitions in the life of a clownfish is when they move from their larval stage to being a juvenile clownfish.To give them a good shot at developing, transition their food from rotifers to live brine shrimp so that they can get enough energy to grow rapidly.
Watch as your fry turn into juvenile fish.

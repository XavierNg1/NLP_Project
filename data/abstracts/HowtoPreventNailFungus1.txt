Keep your nails natural.As much as nail polish and artificial nails may seem aesthetically appealing, they trap additional moisture in your nails and actually increase your risk of developing a fungal infection.
Be aware that fungal infections can spread from one nail to another.Therefore, if you have developed a fungal infection on one nail, it is important to wash your hands whenever you touch that nail to minimize the chances that the infection will spread from one nail to your other nails.

Approach a house.
When someone answers the door, tell them who you are and what you're selling.
Inform the person of what kinds of cookies you're selling, how much each box costs, when the cookies will be delivered, and answer any questions that they may have.
Fill out the cookie sheet and tie up the sale.
Thank the person and leave via the sidewalk.

Go to the website Ask Jud where you will be presented with two boxes, one asking for your "petition", and one asking for the question you wish to ask.
Ask your friend for a question to ask Jud, or better yet, pose a question of your own.
Begin entering the standard petition (which is "Jud, please answer:") into the "petition" box.
Type the answer to the question your friends have asked you.
End your the answer to your question with a period (full stop).
Fill in the question box with the question provided by your friends.
Watch in amazement as your friends are bewildered by Jud and his ability to know the answer to their question.

Give away all the clothes that don't fit or you do not care for!,
Get some inspiration.
Use your money well!,
Get a new hair style.
Hit the gym or run, do push-ups, play sports, etc.If you are really skinny, lift weights to gain muscle.
Be confident!,
Be friendly and outgoing, don't show off your new look.
How can you improve your hygiene?

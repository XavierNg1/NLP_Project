Treat your students with respect.
Be firm and matter of fact about rules, not argumentative.
Walk toward the source of noise, misconduct or toward a particular student, but remain clear of the student's personal space.
Focus on student achievement above all.
Collaborate with other successful teachers.
Be a leader, a person to trust and a person to have learning-fun with.
Compliment the work, not the student.
Never threaten.
Use the "teacher-look".
Take a deep breath.
Be consistent.

Acknowledge and talk about the fear.Giving voice to a child’s fear is a great way to begin the conversation.
Let the child know that it’s normal to have fears.Everyone (even adults) can have fears, and sometimes kids need to be reassured of that.
Recognize the “triggers” and specific anxieties related to the child’s fear.
Determine the root of the child’s fear.
Take a playful approach to overcoming the fear.Play is an important way children learn about their environments, and you can use playfulness and a sense of exploration to reduce anxiety surrounding the presence of a smoke detector in the home.
Create positive or pleasant associations with the fire alarm.You can redirect the child’s automatic jump into negativity and anxiety by giving them something positive to associate with the jarring sound of the alarm instead of danger or fire.
Gradually increase your child’s exposure to triggers over time.
Celebrate small victories.Use positive reinforcement to encourage the child as they overcome their fear gradually through cognitive redirection and exposure.
Remind children of their past successes when facing new fears.The successes a child has dealing with the fear of fire alarms can be used as encouragement when new fears arise.
Reassure infants during and after a sudden alarm to reduce the chance of trauma.

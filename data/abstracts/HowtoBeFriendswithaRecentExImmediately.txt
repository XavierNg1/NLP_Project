Make sure that you and your ex-partner are happy to remain friends.
If you want your ex back as a partner, don't get desperate.
Try not to think about the good memories of you and your partner.
Try to keep things as normal as possible with your ex.
If you need to cry, do it.
Eat as if you don't feel ill, and drink water like you're dehydrated.
Relax a little.
Try not to stress about little niggling thoughts.
When you see your ex, remember to keep calm.
Don't go out of your way to be too friendly.
Make every meeting with your ex a pleasant experience.

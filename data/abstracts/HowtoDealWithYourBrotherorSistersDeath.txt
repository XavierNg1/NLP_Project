Accept there is no 'right' or 'wrong' way to deal with this.
Keep talking about how you are feeling as much as possible.
Also be aware you may need time to yourself.
Create mementos or items to celebrate and remember your brother or sister.
Remember you are not the only person to be grieving and other people's actions will be influenced by this.
Look for counseling or other professional help.
Specifically ask not for pity.
Whenever you are talking with someone, don't act unusually or bring up the topic.
Grieve but not too much.
If someone gives you a present reminding you of your late sibling, keep it.
Make a little "memory gift" yourself.

Realize (while being confident) that good and evil are opposite: and God and Jesus love the world.
Consider why God started over the first time.
Understand how at a time later, God visited our earth, when Joseph and Mary (or Maria) were engaged for marriage, and loved each other.
Look for hope: Jesus did many miracles and taught people how to be blessed.
Pray every night.
Read the Bible.
Be His friend!,
Read John Chapter3 and learn how God loved us all enough that he offered us eternal life through Jesus and that Jesus said we must be born of water and the Spirit to be a part of this.

,
Acknowledge that you believe that Jesus was born, lived and died for our sins, was resurrected and lives to intercede for us.

,
Promise to live your life for the Lord, and go to church to fellowship; and share the Good News more broadly as a witness to what God has done for you.

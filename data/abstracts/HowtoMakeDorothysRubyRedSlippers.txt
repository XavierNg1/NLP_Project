Lay out old newspaper outside or in a well-ventilated place and place shoes on it.

Paint shoes with red paint.
Try for two even coats.
Leave shoes to dry in well-ventilated area for 1-2 days, to make sure that when gluing on sequins the paint will not come off (the purpose of this is so the natural color of the shoe will not come through the gaps between the sequins).

Plug in the hot glue gun and wait for it to heat up.
Lay out large red sequins.

Glue on sequins one at a time with a small dab of hot glue.Let the shoes dry/cool for about 15 minutes.

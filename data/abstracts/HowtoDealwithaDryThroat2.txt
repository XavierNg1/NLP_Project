Avoid tobacco smoke and pollutants.
Address possible mouth-breathing.Breathing through an open mouth not only exposes the back of the throat to drier external air, it also means incoming air bypasses the typically moist environment inside the nose.
Address possible acid reflux or GERD.
Deal with dry air by using a humidifier.
Rule out more serious conditions.

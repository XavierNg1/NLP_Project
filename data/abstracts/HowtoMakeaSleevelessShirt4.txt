Find a sewing pattern for a sleeved shirt and a fabric to use.
Reduce the width of your pattern at the shoulder by making new marks on it.
Cut your pattern along the new lines.
Trace your pattern onto the fabric.There are a variety of tools you can use to do this, but it is most important to use a tool that will wash out or leave no mark, if possible.
Trim two extra strips of fabric on the bias in order to finish the armholes.This is a type of finish on the armholes that will give them a polished look.
Follow the directions of the pattern to sew most of the shirt together, including the neckline.
Fold and press your binding to begin the process of finishing the armholes.
Pin the binding around the armholes.
Make a small mark on the binding where it meets the side seam.Use a washable pen or other fabric-friendly tool to do this.
Pull the bias tape, or the binding, away from the shirt.
Sew all the way around the armhole.
Press the binding away from the shirt at the new seam you just made.You should now have a small “sleeve” sticking out from the armhole and are ready to finish off the armhole.
Use a sewing machine to stitch the armhole closed around the folded edge.This is the last step in polishing the arm hole on a sleeveless shirt made from scratch.

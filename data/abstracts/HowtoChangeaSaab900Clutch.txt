Believe in yourself.The year and model was a 1984 Saab 900 turbo to answer some of the questions.
Get rid of all the stuff in your way.- open the hood and disconnect the windshield washer hose near the right headlight.
Never hesitate- you will get depressed and look for a tow rope- your screwdriver will remove the three big air supply tubes for the engine.
While you are now aware of where the turbo is- stuff a small rag in the hole with the fan and remove the plastic "air in" line.
Last of the tubes is the carb heat.
Stand back and look at the progress you've made.
Now find the Allen head screws that hold the plastic cover over the clutch.
This is important---The pressure plate will not go on just any way.
Now we loosen the pressure plate.
The clutch slave cylinder is held in place with 3 allen bolts or 10mm headed bolts.
Things are real loose now.
Review: 1) clutch is loose with pressure plate.
Thread a wire through a bolt hole on the clutch pressure plate.
Gather everything up.If it all looks like the right stuff, get your grease and sealer and head for home.
If you took all the right photographs and good notes, you can start the reverse process by loading your flywheel back on the engine.install your new throw out bearing assembly.
To load the clutch and pressure plate will require some finesse.
Now that you have wrestled the clutch sandwich into place you must undo the all thread and rescue the nut and washer from the flywheel.
You're almost done!,
Now you can put your alignment dowels in place and start the pressure plate bolts.Your photos notes and a trail of bread crumbs will guide you back to a running automobile.

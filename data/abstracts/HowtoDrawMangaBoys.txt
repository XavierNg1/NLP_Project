It is always good to begin with a stickman sketch of where you want your character on the page and what pose he will be in.
When drawing a guy, remember he is usually more lean and box-like, and you can make him more muscular and defined as opposed to drawing a smooth, curvy outline for a girl.
Draw the head shape first in pencil, including the hairline and sideburns.
For the face, draw where you want the eyes to be.
The hair is always messy and standing up in odd angles.
Focusing on clothes is fun!,
Check your drawing to see if it looks right.

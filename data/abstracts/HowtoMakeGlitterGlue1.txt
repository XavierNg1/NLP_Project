Find a bottle of clear school glue.
Squeeze out some of the glue into a small jar.
Open up a container of extra fine, scrapbooking glitter.
Take the cap off the glue bottle and add about a tablespoon (15 grams) of glitter.
Consider adding a few drops of food coloring to make your glitter glue more colorful when it dries.
Close the bottle tightly, and shake it to mix the glue and glitter.
Add more glitter if necessary.
Use the glue to draw glittery designs and letters on your art projects.

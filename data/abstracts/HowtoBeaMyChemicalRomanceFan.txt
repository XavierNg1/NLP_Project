Listen to their music.
Here's a list of their 4 Studio Albums.
Be yourself and don't change who you are if you think it will make you a "bigger" fan.
Don't be annoying about it: It sucks and it's really sad that they broke up, but don't go on about it.
Listen to their solo music.
Never say you are their 'biggest' fan.
Be happy for them, rather than spiteful.
Make sure you know the members: Know more members besides Gerard.
Also don't forget their past members.

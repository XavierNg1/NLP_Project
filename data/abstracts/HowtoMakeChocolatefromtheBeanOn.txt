Take 100 grams of cocoa beans and spread them on your roasting pan.
When the beans have cooled, put the cocoa beans in a plastic bag.
Pour the beans into a bowl and gently direct the hairdryer over it.
Figure out the amount of chocolate you would like to end up with (100 grams is a good starting point).Add the sugar to the spice grinder and grind until it is a superfine powder.
Add in the nibs and grind for about 5 minutes.
When the chocolate is refined as much as possible, add in spices.
Heat up your mortar and pestle by placing it in a warm microwave for a few minutes.
Taste the mixture every 5 minutes or so.
Melt the chocolate to be tempered at 110 °F (43 °C).
Eventually, the chocolate will take a sludgy consistency.

Ensure you meet the requirements.
(optional) Have a back up plan should things go wrong.
Get a copy of a Windows 7 ISO file.
If you used a USB: Go ahead and erase your hard drive, or if you want to make sure you can use your system even if it all messes up, just pop your USB in anyway, and start set up.
No matter what you did, you can't update Windows XP to 7.
Hopefully installation went smoothly.

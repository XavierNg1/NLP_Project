Purchase flake food made for tropical fish.
Feed the guppies a pinch of flake food once or twice a day, preferably in the morning and at night, leaving a twelve hour difference between the two.
Replace the occasional flake food meal with more nutritious treats.
Avoid tubifex worms and live daphnia.
Watch for signs of overfeeding.
Consider feeding methods for vacations longer than one week.

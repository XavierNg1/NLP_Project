Plan!,
If you want to buy your ticket on the day of travel leave enough spare time to allow for queuing at the ticket office.
Arrive early onto the train's platform.
Ask staff or look at the departure boards to see which platform your train will leave from.
Get on the train!,
Relax.
Get off the train.
Look out for seats for disabled travellers.

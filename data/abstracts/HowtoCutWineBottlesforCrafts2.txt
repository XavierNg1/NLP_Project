Purchase an industrial bottle cutter or sharp precision knife.
Snugly wrap an industrial hose clamp around the wine bottle to provide a "tracing" line.
Using a sharp, precision knife, score the bottle by following your tracing line.
Heat the line you scored over a candle.
Rub an ice cube around the scored line.
Reheat the bottle and reapply the ice cube if it doesn't work at first.
Sand away any rough edges before using.

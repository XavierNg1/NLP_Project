Track your spending.
At the end of the month, look carefully at what you wrote.
In a separate paper, write down all your income.
Write down your living expenses.
If your income cannot support your basic living expenses you need to make more money!,
Write down your "necessary" expenses.
Even if you can afford your personal luxuries, think about cutting back.
Once you've decided on how much you'll save, act on it.
Every month, after you put your savings aside, tackle your fixed expenses.
Now you're left with spendable money.
The jar can get you through unforeseen small expenses.
With the savings you put aside, you can go two ways.
Keep substituting spending habits for almost free ones, to save more.

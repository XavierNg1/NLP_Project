View a webinar as a "live-web-seminar" in each of your offices or homes, wherein the seminar is held at dozens of sites at one time, exchanging information across hundreds or thousands of miles/kilometers in all different directions, in a special kind of computer assisted "conference call", using your cell phone or wired phone connected for all to hear each other.
Use a webinar hosting service to get connected.
Realize some things that you need, although holding a webinar is easy.
Consider, also, arranging to get information from marketing companies, technicians, or suppliers, using the webinar method -- contacting them to set up a webinar conference for your associates to meet online.

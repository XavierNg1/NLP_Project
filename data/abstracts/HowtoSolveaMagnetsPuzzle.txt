Look for any total charge counts that are equal to or one less than the length of that row or column.

Look for a row or column that has an unbalanced charge and combine this with the fact that each whole domino is neutral.

If any row or column has its full number of charged poles, mark the remaining cells in that row or column as neutral.

Note the number of neutral cells needed in each row and column.

Fill in the orientation of the magnets that share an edge with another magnet of known orientation.
,

Now that additional charged and neutral dominoes have been identified, revisit the earlier steps and check the row and column sums again.
,
Look for any row or column that has only one domino perpendicular to it whose charge isn't accounted for.

Continue looking at the total and net charges for additional places to apply these ideas.

Look for almost completed rows or columns where the charge of each pole has been identified.

Look for dominoes that lie adjacent to charged dominoes in a way that forces them to be neutral.

Finishing this example puzzle only requires repeating types of logical deduction already applied.

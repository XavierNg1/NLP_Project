Call your motorcycle shop and ask them if there is a race track with a motorcycle â€œTrack Day".
Get protective gear (don't skimp here):

Gloves should be race type gloves, very thick at the knuckles, possibly rivets on the palms.
Go over your motorcycle thoroughly.
Transport your bike to the track.
Hydrate.
Listen carefully to the instructor.

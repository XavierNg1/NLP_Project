Use a rock or figurine that has a hole in the middle that extends all the way to the bottom of the figurine.
Paint the rock with acrylic paint.
Apply embellishments to the rocks when you don't have paint on hand or when you want to add detail that is difficult to paint.
Wait for the paint on the rock to dry.

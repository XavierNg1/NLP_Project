Using 4" squares, you will need approximately 115 squares to make a 60 x 84 inch quilt (15 x 21 squares).
Gather around the 5" square or make darts in the middle of two of the sides to fit the 4" square.
Turn right side out, carefully pulling the corners out.
Distribute the stuffing evenly.
When all your squares are finished, you can join them together by: slip stitching them together or use rickrack, braid or ribbon to join.

The quilt should have a backing.

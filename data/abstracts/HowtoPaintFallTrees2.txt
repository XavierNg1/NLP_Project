Acquire a form of paper that is specified for use with watercolors.
Get sponges or watercolor-specified brushes to enable you to spread the paint correctly onto the paper.
Gather your colors.
Set up your materials, and begin your painting!,
Start with using your light or dark brown watercolors to create a thick or slender trunk for your tree.
Using your sponge, get some red, orange, or yellow paint to create the leaves on the tree.
Repeat these steps until your paper is full of fall trees everywhere.
Finished.

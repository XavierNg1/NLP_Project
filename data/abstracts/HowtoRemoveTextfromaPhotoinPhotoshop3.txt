Open your image in Photoshop.
Give the copy a name.
Click the Clone Stamp on the tools pallet.
Click the Layers panel.
Place your cursor over a spot that is as close to the lettering as possible.
Be careful not to get too close to the lettering, as the source will move as you paint over the text.
Open the Options menu and choose Aligned.
Release the Alt key and move the mouse over the lettering that you want to cover up.
Paint in small sections.

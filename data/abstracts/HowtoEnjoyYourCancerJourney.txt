Go into the meeting with your doctor prepared.
Prepare yourself, emotionally.
Take notes!,
Go to the pub.
Tell everyone.
Make time for research.
Use retail therapy to your advantage.
Take someone with you when you go to chemo.
Take all the tablets they give you.
Eat boring old plain food.
Walk every day.
Rest when you need to.
Laugh as much as you can.
Spend as much time with friends as you can.
Be open to new people.
Let it go when the ride finishes and get on with your life.

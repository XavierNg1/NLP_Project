If you are using a charcoal grill, fill a chimney starter to the rim with charcoal and burn the coals until they are lightly covered with ash.
Place a large, disposable drip pan in the center of the charcoal grate and fill it about halfway with warm water.
Put the cooking grate in place, close the lid, and let the coals burn down to low heat.
Start by rinsing your turkey with cold, clean water inside and out.
Pour the chicken stock into a sturdy 9Ã—13-inch roasting pan.
Place the roasting pan in the center of the cooking grate.
After 1 hour of grilling, add 10-12 unlit charcoal briquettes to maintain the temperature of your grill.
At the end of the second hour, baste the turkey all over with the remaining butter.
Move the turkey to a cutting board, wrap in aluminum foil, and allow it to rest for 30 minutes before carving.

Research your company's pregnancy and maternity leave policies before you announce your pregnancy.
Consider your options concerning the number of weeks of maternity leave you will take and whether you plan to return to work after the baby is born.
Announce your pregnancy to your immediate supervisor or boss before you tell other coworkers--out of respect.
Present your plans regarding maternity leave and suggest solutions for handling the work in your absence.
Confirm any schedule changes and other work arrangements in writing.

Place the burned area under cool water.
Reassure the child.Oftentimes, a burn can be a scary experience for a young child.
Gently clean the skin.Prior to bandaging the burn, be sure to clean it thoroughly with soap and water.
Leave small blisters unbroken.Oftentimes burns will leave the skin with some blisters present; if this is the case, let them heal naturally and do not attempt to break them open.
Try moisturizing ointment.After cooling the burned area, as long as there is not any broken skin or open blisters, applying a moisturizing ointment can have a soothing effect as well.
Cover the wound from the burn with a sterile dressing.This will help to protect it from the environment, and will help it to heal.
Consider your child's last tetanus immunization.Whenever there is an open wound, medical protocol calls for the administration of a tetanus shot.
Encourage your child not to scratch.Scratching the wound that remains following a burn only predisposes the wound to opening up further and increases the chances of infection.

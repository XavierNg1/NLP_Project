Check the ABC's: Airway, breathing and circulation.
Apply traction and maintain traction through the entire process.
Find two long branches or sticks.
Put the forked end of the sticks at the top near the chest or armpit and the crotch or groin.
Cut or dig out notches in the bottom of the sticks to make a groove for a short stick that you will need to find to become a cross member that will be used later.
Take some rope or anything else that you can use as a tie, and start securing the long branches to the body.
Find one last piece of rope and starting in the middle, wrap it around the ankle, so the tag ends of this rope will be dangling.
Locate a short stubby stick that you can put in between the "V" of the rope from the ankle to the cross member.
Stop twisting once the legs are equal length, and then secure the short winching stick to the cross member so that it does not twist back and reverse what you just did.

Continue to monitor your work and make sure that traction is maintained.

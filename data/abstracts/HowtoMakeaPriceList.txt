Determine your costs.
Conduct pricing research.
Know your market.
Avoid underpricing.Many businesses are tempted to set their prices lower than competitors', thinking that this will encourage more customers to buy their products or services.
Donâ€™t overprice.Alternatively, if you set your prices too high, customers might be unable or unwilling to pay for your goods/services.
Decide what you need to make.
Make a list of the goods or services you sell.
Decide if your list reflects standardized or tailored prices.Some businesses, such as retail operations, may set a price for each product that stays the same no matter who the customer is.
Format your list.
Share your price list with customers.
Prepare written estimates as needed.You and your customers can reference your price list as needed.
Date each list or estimate.
Use software or a service.Many business and personal office software programs have templates for preparing a price list.
Monitor your metrics.
Test new offers.To boost your sales and increase your customer base, you may want to try sales, coupons, and other special offers from time to time.
Lower prices sparingly.Simply cutting your prices is not necessarily the best way to increase sales.
Raise prices over longer periods of time, and according to a strategic plan.You may need to raise your prices for various reasons (production costs, inflation, profit margins, etc.).

Locate the piece you wish to perform.
Read through the monologue thoroughly.
Ascertain the meaning of each line.
Assess the emotional state of the character, and do not over-simplify; view the monologue as a winding road which takes the character through a variety of thought and states, over hills which bring heightened emotion, and into valleys of calm.
Go through and find operative and "juicy words" to accent in your line/monologue.
Practice, practice practice!

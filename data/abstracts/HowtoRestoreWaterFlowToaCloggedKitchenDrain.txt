Realize that when water does not run through your drain, it is because there is a bunch of junk and trash clogged up in one of the pipes.
Hair clogs.
Try a plunger.
Keep at it.
Seal off secondary openings.
If the plunger doesn't work, you may have to snake it.
Buy a "snake" (also known as a drain cleaning auger).
Insert the snake into the drain pipe where you removed the trap (easier than from the drain in the bottom of the sink), and when you meet resistance, rotate the snake clockwise.
When you retrieve a snake from the pipe, be prepared for it to be covered in the most vile, black, smelly sewer-line sludge (even for kitchen drain lines).
Sometimes clogs can be more easily approached with a snake from the air vent on the roof.
If the snake doesn't reach the clog, look for a clean out (unscrew a plug in the drain pipe in the basement) further down the drain where the snake may be inserted.

Slow drains.
Sometimes there can be a problem with the slope of the drain pipes (although plumbing codes are designed to prevent this, not all pipes are up to code).
Although plungers are a standard way to clear a clogged toilet, they can be messy to clean afterward.
If this is your kitchen sink, and it has become plugged from running the garbage disposal.

Find out your teacher's open hours, or email them asking if you can see them at a certain time.
Don't be nervous!,
Let them your goal in the class, and tell them that you're concerned by your current grade.
Ask how you can do better, and if there's any way they can help you.
Thank your teacher for their time, and follow their advice.

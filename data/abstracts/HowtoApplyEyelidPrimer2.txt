Cleanse your face and apply moisturizer.
Dab a small amount of primer on the back of your hand--it should only be about the size of a grain of rice.
Dip your ring finger or a small brush into the primer and dab it on your eyelid.
Allow the primer to absorb and dry (about 20 seconds) and then do your eye makeup as normal.Your eyelid should feel like a flat canvass and your shadow should go on smoothly.
Finished.

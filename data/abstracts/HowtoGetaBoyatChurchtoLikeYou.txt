If you are in the same class/group as him, then give him a few signs that you like him.
Make it almost impossible for him not to notice you.
If you know he likes you, try to be his friend before taking your "relationship" to the next level.
If you are feeling confident and believe he likes you also, then ask him to stay after teen class so you can be alone.
The couple that plays together, stays together.
Girls can make the first move too!,
Remember to a) stay modest (in your language and image), b) natural and c) true to yourself!

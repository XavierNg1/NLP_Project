Try to start your story with a great hook.
See the images that you want to write about in your head like a scene from a movie.
If you need a little inspiration, go to your public library and find a book with picture sentences.
Try using dialogue!,
Throw out boring words!,
For a while, just don't think about your writing.
The most important detail in making your writing come to life is if you believe in it.
Nobody will want to read your sentences if they don't look good on the page!

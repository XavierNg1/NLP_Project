Provide shelter.While downy woodpeckers (like all woodpeckers) prefer nesting in the hollows of trees, they might also be interested in living in an appropriately-sized birdhouse.
Put out their favorite foods.Downy Woodpeckers adore suet.
Provide a drumming site.In order to attract mates and claim territory, woodpeckers of both sexes will make a rapid tapping against wood with their beaks.If you want to provide an artificial drumming site, you can nail a board firmly to a tree about ten to twenty feet up, then attach another board to the first, nailing it only at the top edge.You should locate the site well away from your house, since the noise of woodpeckers drumming can be quite loud.
Provide a birdbath.

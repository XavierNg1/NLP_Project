Gather a small section of hair/braids, and separate it into 3 smaller sections.
Hold the 3 small sections of hair in both hands and cross the right section of hair over the middle section.
Grab a small section of hair from the left side of your head near the top front and join it with the left section of the braid.
Now grab a small section of hair from the right side of your head and join it with the right section of the braid.
Continue steps 3-4 until you have "used up" all of your hair.
Finish by securing your braid with an elastic or hair tie!

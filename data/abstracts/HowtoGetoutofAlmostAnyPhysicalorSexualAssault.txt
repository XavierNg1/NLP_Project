Remember: if your attacker just wants things—your money, wallet, purse, jewelry, or anything but you, give it to him/her!,
Remember that there are no foolproof methods that will work every time in every situation.
Get away, in any way you can.
Resist your instinct to defend yourself.
Remember that your first tactic should be to look for an escape, but if you can’t, let him/her think that this is what you want.
Try to calm your attacker and persuade him/her not to carry out the attack.
If you are at home, tell him/her somebody will be there or back soon.
Gross him/her out.
If you decide to fight, make sure that you are not afraid to inflict serious pain on your attacker.

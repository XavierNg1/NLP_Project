Know the situations in which it is appropriate to bargain.
Find out what locals pay.
Determine what the item is worth to you.
Have cash in hand.
If an item is worth more to you than you paid for it, it doesn't really matter whether you paid more than the local.
Don't project fondness or over-enthusiasm for whatever you're eyeing.
Start 25% to 30% lower than the listed offer or the first offer.
Get a friend or spouse to work with you.
Don't be afraid to walk away from an item, even one that you love.
Be prepared to spend a long time bargaining.
When the seller announces his final offer, don't take the bait (optional).
When the vendor gets to a price you like, stop.

Consider the matrix below.
 Multiply the upper-left entry by the lower-right entry.
 Multiply the upper-right entry by the lower-left entry.
 Subtract the number you just got from the first product.
Consider the matrix below.
 Multiply the upper-left entry by the lower-right entry.
 Multiply the upper-right entry by the lower-left entry.
 Subtract the number you just got from the first product.
Use cofactor expansion.
Identify your matrix.
Identify the "sign" matrix.
Choose a row or column.
Multiply the first number of that row or column with the determinant of its minor.
Next, do the second number.
Finally, do the third number.
Compute the determinants of the minors and sum the results.
Consider the matrix below.
Choose a row or column.
Multiply the numbers with the determinant of their minors, and sum the results.
Compute the determinants of the minors.
Substitute these determinants and evaluate.
Consider the same matrix in Example 1, but choose the third column instead.
Multiply the numbers with the determinant of their minors, and sum the results.
Compute the determinants of the minors.
Substitute these determinants and evaluate.
Identify your matrix.
If this is the case, row or column reduce so that there are a significant number of 0's in the matrix.
Use cofactor expansion.
Consider the matrix below.
Row reduce the matrix to obtain 0's.
Simplify by factoring.
Choose the third row for cofactor expansion.
Choose the third row of the minor matrix for cofactor expansion.
Compute the determinant of the minor and evaluate.

Make the dataset by opening a new Excel worksheet and choosing a cell inwards and downwards about 10 rows and columns to start inputting the numbers into.
Proceed sequentially outwards in a spiral.After you have built the data set up to 100 or 324 (as in the example), you're good to go!,
You will notice right away that the prime numbers are fairly evenly distributed in the 4 quadrants at this point.Notice there are a number of sequences to the columns and numbers which follow Summation Notation.
Notice also that the first sequence is easy -- it's the diagonal from the center to the bottom right.
Notice the horizontal pattern is a bit trickier to discover.
Notice that the diagonals take the form of ((a*b)+c)+d = Sum wherein b_sub_0 is 1 greater than a_sub_zero, a_sub_1 was 2 greater than a_sub_0 and b_sub_1 was 2 greater than b_sub_0, i.e.
There are resolved 2 more sequences: 5=((2*3)-9)+8, 18=((4*5)-10)+8, 39=((6*7)-11)+8, etc.
Review the spirallic dataset again to see if you can spot any other sequences in it -- how about the Fibonacci Series?,

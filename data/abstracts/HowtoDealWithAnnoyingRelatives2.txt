If you do speak, wait before you reply.
Repeat the annoying thing they said.
Change the subject.
When you speak, be respectful, genuine, and diplomatic.
Avoid trigger topics, yours and theirs.Maybe you know that your cherished political beliefs differ from your relatives', or that your body piercings and blue hair make your grandparents cringe.
Choose your battles wisely.
If you need a break, take one.
Know your limits, and defend your boundaries.
Let it go, and walk away.

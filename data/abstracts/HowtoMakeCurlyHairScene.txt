Wash your hair.
Scrunch your hair and part it to the side.
Get some side bangs and straighten them when you wear your hair down.
Tease the roots of your hair with a fine toothed comb.
Color it up!,
Think colors of the rainbow!,
Consider headbands and other clips.
Take it slow and experiment.
Wear you hair up every once in a while.

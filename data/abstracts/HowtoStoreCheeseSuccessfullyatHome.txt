Before buying, make sure the package is properly wrapped and sealed, and that the cheese inside looks appealing.
Keep cheese in a covered container in your refrigerator on a clean, dry, lightly crumpled paper towel or two, leaving a little breathing room.
When mold starts to form, it will consume the oil and not the cheese; simply wipe it off, or rinse in tepid water.
Keep washed rind, blue, flavored and white rind cheeses in separate containers to prevent mingling.

If it's for just a few days, an oversized resealable bag with a crumpled towel will do.
If stored as above and rubbed with oil, larger chunks of semi-hard and hard natural cheeses can keep for months.

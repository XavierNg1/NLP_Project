Now you'll have to create a bootable media from which we can start Parted Magic.
You can burn the ISO file to a CD with any CD burning software which is capable of burning image files.
We'll use a special tool to copy Parted Magic to a USB pen drive, because your pen drive needs to be made bootable.
For Parted Magic to be able to detect your hard drive, it's important to change your hard drive's controller mode to IDE mode before proceeding.
Now we've created our bootable media.
You should see the Parted Magic boot menu.
Now you should see the Parted Magic desktop, similar to a Windows desktop.
In the bottom pane, you should see a list of your hard drive's partitions.
Right-Click the partition you want to set as the active / bootable partition and select "manage flags".
If your system fails to boot and you want to go back, just return to step 7 and this time, set your old active partition to bootable again with Parted Magic.

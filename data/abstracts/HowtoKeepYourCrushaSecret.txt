Do not stare.
Do not giggle hysterically when your crush looks over at you.
Avoid telling anyone that you have a crush on this person.
Keep a diary.
If others say that your crush likes you, just smile and say "that's nice".
Treat your crush exactly the same way as you treat all your acquaintances.
Be real and show your authentic self.

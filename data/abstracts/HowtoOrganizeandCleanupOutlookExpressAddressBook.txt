Let’s get started; open up your Outlook Express Address Book by clicking the icon for the address book.
Look down the list and find any email addresses that are no longer needed, <Select> them with a left mouse click and then click the <Delete> icon.
Recheck the list of email addresses and locate one where the email address appears in the “Name‿ field (column).
Repeat for each email address that appears in the name field.
Now to organize a bit further, let’s say you have some names in your address book that you very seldom use but still want to keep them.
Open up the Address Book, click the mouse (select) “Shared contacts‿, then click New>New folder in the box that comes up input an appropriate name for a group of emails that you want to keep together.
The easiest way to get the names to the new folder is to select each name and drag and drop them into the new folder one at a time.

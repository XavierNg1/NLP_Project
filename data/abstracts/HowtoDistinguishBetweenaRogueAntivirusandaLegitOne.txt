Memorize a few names of "legit" antiviruses.
Memorize a few names of rogue antiviruses as well.
Don't be taken in by instant online scans.
Be careful.
When you think you have downloaded a rogue antivirus, another good way to tell is to open the legit Windows Security Center (if you have Windows).
Never trust or use an online scan.
When you download one of the legit antiviruses that was put in the 1st step, make sure you don't download from random sites.
Beware of sites you go to!,
Detect most rogues anti-virus and remove them by a good functional FREE program like "MalwareBytes Antimalware": (when installing their free version, you have a choice to click their "trial version", but that is not the free version; so to get to the free one, say "no" to the "trial").

Listen.
Assuming you already know some very basic theory, first learn all 12 major scales (there are twelve different sounding scales, but in theory B/Cb, F#/Gb and C#/Db are separate scales).
Make sure you can read music and can play some basic stuff, even if it's not jazz.
Buy a songbook of one of the masters: Cole Porter, Gershwin, etc.
Learn a major 7th (1 3 5 7), minor 7th (1 b3 5 b7), dominant 7th (1 3 5 b7), half diminished (1 b3 b5 b7), and diminished chord (1 b3 b5 bb7) of every key.
To reward your hard work, pull out the songbook.
Even though it probably sounds horrible, practice for long enough and you'll sound more and more like what's written there without you even knowing it.
Next, learn chord inversions: learn to play CM7 like (C, E, G, B), (E, G, B, C), (G, B, C, E) and (B, C, E, G).
Learn the pentatonic scale of your favourite key.

,
Add in a couple of notes from it into a song you're comfortable with.
Now learn the blues scale of that same key and mix the two.
Look at the chord sequences in the songs you're playing.
Learn the 3, 6, 2, 5, 1 progression.
When you're ready, learn chromatic and diatonic harmony.

Don't wear big bracelets when you know you'll be doing important tasks with your hands.
If you're wearing long sleeves under your bracelet, try to arrange it so that the sleeveÂ and your bracelet align at the edge of your wrist.
For short sleeves, simply let the bracelet rest against your wrist.
Experiment with wearing more than one big bracelet at a time.
Wear the best quality of bracelet you can comfortably afford.

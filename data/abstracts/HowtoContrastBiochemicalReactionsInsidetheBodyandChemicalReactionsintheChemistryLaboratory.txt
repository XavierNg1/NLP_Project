Define metabolic reactions.
Study the regulation of body temperature as an example of a biochemical reaction.
Be aware that biochemical reactions inside the body are, in most cases, catalyzed reactions that use enzymes for their progress to completion.
Contrast the selectivity involved in biochemical reactions with that of the chemical laboratory reactions.
Study the use of enzymes for catalyzing these reactions.

Assemble the trombone by carefully placing the screw-end of the bell section to the screw end of the slide and twist to form a right angle then from here adjust to your hand size, with the bell facing away from you making sure that when you hold it the bell is on the left.
Hold the assembled trombone by supporting the tubing around the screw-joint with the left hand and putting your right hand on the movable part of the slide.
Pick up the trombone.
Keep your body centered when playing.
To make sound come out of the instrument, you need to make an 'o' shape with your lips, the corners tight, leaving the centre of your lips loose.
To play higher pitched notes, you must make your lips tighter, your jaw should raise naturally and your air blowing in a more downward motion.
To play lower notes, you need to loosen the centre of your lips and drop your jaw.
If you have never played a brass instrument before this could be challenging.
If you want to learn more than just how to mess about with it, there are seven positions for the slide.
Increase your range of notes by practicing regularly (preferably once a day for at least half an hour) and increase your lip flexibility by moving from one note to a higher one and back, gradually getting faster, and trying to keep an even sound.
Increase your lung capacity.

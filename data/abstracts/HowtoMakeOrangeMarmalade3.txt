Place a canning rack on the bottom of a large sauce pot and fill with jars, lids, and tongs.
Boil enough water that your cans are covered.
Remove the jars with tongs and pat dry after 10 minutes.
Fill the jars with hot marmalade, pouring until just under the threads.
Tighten the lids onto the jars.
Drop the jars gently in boiling water for 10 minutes.
Remove the jars carefully and let them cool to room temperature overnight.
Push the top of the can down -- it will spring back if you canned properly.

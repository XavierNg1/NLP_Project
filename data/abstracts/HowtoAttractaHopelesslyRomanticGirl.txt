Girls of this type are usually shy, quiet or easily intimidated.
Once you two are on good terms, you know you have a chance.
Be sure to keep an eye on her so that if she needs to be rescued, you're there.
If she ever cries in front of you, comfort her.
Don't be afraid to be romantic.
Give her a single red rose on her birthday.
If you ask her out, ask her in person.
Progress with her slowly, even if it means holding back.
Never, ever, do anything that will hurt her, mentally or physically.
If she does something for you, remember that she most likely put her entire being into it.
Never force her to do something.

Linger nearby as it grazes, or spend time talking to it in its stall.
Â Make sure you talk to it so it can get used to your voice.
Hang out for a couple hours each day, and take as long as the horse needs.
Make sure it's comfortable with you before moving on.

Try to catch it.
Let it loose.
If you can safely be in the round pen with the horse, grab a lunge-whip and adopt the center of the pen, forcing the horse out toward the rail.
After the horse is moving, lower the whip - don't drop it.
Keep the horse going around the pen, letting it canter or trot as much as it needs to.
Once the horse is moving, jog back to your place at the center and keep it moving.
Don't let the horse break its gait without you telling it to.
Stop driving it again.
Praise the horse for stopping, and if you can, walk up to it and give it a pat.

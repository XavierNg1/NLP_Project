Find a willow twig that has no side branches.
Carve a small notch into the twig, about a quarter of the length in.

,
Cut a ring around the twig about two inches further in than the notch.
Remove the bark.
Make the notch deeper and cut it some more so that it extends down the length of the twig, pointing towards the end that still has bark on it.
Carve off a sliver of wood from the upper surface of the twig to make it flat.

,
Slip the bark back on.
Finished.

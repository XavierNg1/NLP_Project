Head out to the forest, wooded area, neighbors yard or wherever you can find a big stick.
Take the wood and strip it of the bark.
Take the wood and cut it into 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) circles.
Once the circles are cut use the leftover wood and cut a 2 inch (5.1 cm) long piece.
Set the links aside and pull out the push pins and the foam core board.
Now take a link and lay it across 2 circles so it is evenly placed between the two.
Continue the previous step till row 1 has all its inlay set with all it neighbors.
Once all the inlays are finished and both pages are complete, sand the whole thing down.
Once it is sanded to your liking, grab that remaining piece of branch and cut a 4 inch (10.2 cm) piece of it.
Stain it.
Once it is all dry, lay the pages and spine face up.
Once it is glued together, make sure it closes evenly and easily.
Measure the pleather straps and secure them on one side of the book.
Decorate the pages.
When it's all finished, put it together.

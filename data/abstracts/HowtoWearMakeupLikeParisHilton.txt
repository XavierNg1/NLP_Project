Moisturize your face.
Apply toner.
Use a good primer to prime your face for makeup.
Use foundation.

Be very sparing with the bronzer.
Use blush.
Dab illuminator on your cheek bones, on the bridge of your nose, and around the sides of your mouth to get that same glow.
Curl and apply mascara to your eye lashes.

Use Nars lip gloss in the color 'Super Orgasm' to give a natural tint to your lips.
Finished.

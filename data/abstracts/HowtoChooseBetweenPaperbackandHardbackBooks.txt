Hold the books.
Consider the purpose of the book.
Consider the price.
Consider the time delay, if any.
Take into account the difference in durability.
Consider the long-term environmental impact.
Decide if you want the book now or later.
Note that sometimes there is no choice.
Throw non-print books into the equation.
Don't be a slave to preferring one type over another.
View the publication of your own book in a similar light to the reader's decisions for purchasing one type of book over another:


Is your book likely to be popular and used as a reference work or become a bestseller?,
Consider whether it is either viable or possible for you to print a run of both hardcover and softcover books.
Consider producing eBooks and books for eReaders and the iPad.

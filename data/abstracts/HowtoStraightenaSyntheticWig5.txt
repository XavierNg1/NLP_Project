Use this method only on heat-resistant wigs.
Pull the wig hair up into a loose bun, but leave the bottom-most weft loose.
Take a small section of hair and smooth out any tangles.
Spray the small section of hair with water.
Turn your iron on to the lowest heat setting possible.
Run the section through the iron like you would with your own hair.
Allow the fibers to cool down.
Repeat the process for the rest of the row.
Once you have finished that row, undo the bun and let down the next layer of hair.

Begin screening at the age of 50.For the general population (those who have not been designated to be at a heightened risk of colon cancer), screening is recommended to commence at the age of 50.
Opt for a stool test.Both blood and/or DNA can be tested for in your stool, and a positive test indicates suspicion that you may have colon cancer.
Get a colonoscopy.A colonoscopy is an alternative method of screening for colon cancer; it is much more invasive than a simple stool test, but also more accurate.
Consider other modes of screening.Most people opt for either the stool testing or the colonoscopy as a means to screen for colon cancer.

Decide whether to purchase starts, grow from seed indoors or plant outside, just as you would summer squash plants.
Wait two to four weeks after the last frost to plant winter squash.
Plant seeds in hills six feet (2m) apart and rows eight feet (2.5 m) apart.
Plant five or six seeds per hill or three seedlings.
Water deeply once or twice a week.
Set growing fruit on a wooden plank or rock to discourage pests from ruining the fruit.
Let the winter squash ripen completely on the vine.
Cut the ripe squash from the plant with sharp garden shears, leaving approximately two inches (5cm) of stem.

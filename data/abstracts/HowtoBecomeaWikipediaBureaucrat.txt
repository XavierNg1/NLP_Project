Decide if you actually want to be a bureaucrat.
Study old bureaucrat requests at the requests for adminiship board to understand what is expected of bureaucrats.
Go to the requests for adminship page, and in the box that says "Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/USERNAME," replace "adminship" with "bureaucratship," and "USERNAME" with your Wikipedia username.
Remove the requests for adminship template, and replace it with {{subst:RfB|User=USERNAME|Description=YOUR DESCRIPTION OF THE USER}} Put in your username where it says "USERNAME" and your description of why you want to be a bureaucrat where it says "YOUR DESCRIPTION OF THE USER.",
Click on "Edit Page" at the top of the page, and answer the three standard questions.
Copy the code {{Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/USERNAME}} and paste it at the top of the requests for bureaucratship list.
Go through the process.

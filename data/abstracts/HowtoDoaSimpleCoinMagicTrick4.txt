Get something cloth-like, a penny, and a piece of double-sided tape.
Take your cloth and show it to the audience.
Stick the penny in the center of the cloth, tape side up.
Fold the corners in, starting with the taped corner.
Reveal the empty cloth by unfolding the corners, making sure your finger is on the penny.

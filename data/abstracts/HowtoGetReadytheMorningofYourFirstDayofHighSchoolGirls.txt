The night before your first day, pack an emergency kit that includes pads/tampons, an extra pair of underwear and some extra money change (in case you forget lunch at home);
,
Wake up early!,
Splash super cold tap water on your face to get yourself awake.
Take a warm shower.
If you are going to shave, this would be the time to do it.
When you get out of the shower, dry off with a towel and apply moisturizing cream all over your body.

,
Put on your underwear (top and bottom) then spray your favorite perfume on your pulse spots.
Now put on your outfit picked out for the day but leave out accessories, socks and shoes, and just put on the basics like top and bottoms.

,
Now go do your hair.
The last thing you do is your makeup and put on accessories.
After you are completely ready, make sure your books and belongings are ready to go.

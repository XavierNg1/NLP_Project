There are so many girls who are basically throwing themselves away at guys by acting promiscuously in their manner of dress, their style of speech, not to mention socially and sexually compromising themselves in order to get a boyfriend.
Mature guys like mature girls, but not if it's fake.
Be polite and courteous.
Smile.
Be confident and self-assured.
Visualize success in everything you do, but be prepared to deal with failure just as easily.
Stay on top of your work, and keep your mind active.
Love your friends and family and treat them with respect.
Be yourself.
Stay clean.
Use your time wisely.
Be tactful.
Learn how to read a situation.
Don't constantly complain that you think you're too clumsy, or your hair is too frizzy, or your nose is too big.
Guys like "shiny" things, and that doesn't necessarily mean they like the girls wearing micro-miniskirts and 5-inch stiletto heels.

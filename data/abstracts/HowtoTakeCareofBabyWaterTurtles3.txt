Feed your turtle daily.
Be sure to put their food in the water.
Consider feeding your baby turtle in a separate container of water.
Offer a variety of foods to hatchlings.
Expand the variety as your baby turtle grows.
Be aware that newly hatched turtles may not eat for a week or more.
Make sure the water in your tank is warm enough if your turtle is not eating after a few weeks.
Leave your turtle alone to eat.

Prepare for the task.
Arrive at church at the very latest at least 20 minutes before the Mass begins (Make a visit to Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament in the Chapel).
Go to the Sacristy in your church that holds the altar serving albs or cassocks and cottas/surplices.
Decide who will be doing which jobs.
Wait for the priest or deacon and, on some occasions, the bishop to join you at the entry to the church.
Stand at your seats singing during the opening hymn, which will have been sung during your procession up the aisle.
During the homily, listen attentively to what the priest has to say.
At the preparation of the gifts, sometimes called Offertory, bread and wine are brought to the altar.
If bells are used, ring once at the epiclesis (when the priest calls down the Holy Spirit by extending his hands over the gifts), and three times each for the elevation of the Host and the chalice.
Follow the local custom when receiving the Holy Communion.
After the priest or deacon sings or says the dismissal, all of the servers will move to the entrance to the sanctuary in their pairs, usually in the same order that they processed up in.
Clean up.

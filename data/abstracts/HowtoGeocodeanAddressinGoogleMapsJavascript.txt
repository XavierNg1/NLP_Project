Start off with a web page that you have added a Google javascript api map to.
Create a text box input for the user to enter the street address.
Create a button input for the user to click to geocode the address.
Declare a variable outside of the initialize function so that it is available in any javascript code, this will store the geocode class object.
Set the geocoder variable equal to an instance of the Google Maps geocoder class as new Google Maps Geocoder() inside the initialize() function.
Add a second function to your javascript code, call it codeAddress.
Make sure that the first line of the function uses getElementById to get the address from the text box and place it into a variable we'll call sAddress.
Call the geocode method of the geocoder object, this will take two passed-in parameters.
The callback function should first check the status value of the callback function.
If the status equals OK, call the setCenter method of the map object variable.
Next, use the same result geometry location to add a map marker to the map object variable.
Finally we're going to add an alert message to the ELSE to let the user know that the Geocode didn't work like it should have.
You can now give it a go!

Prepare the building during the summer: Right after winter semesterâ€™s move out day, there are approximately 100 days until fall move in day.

Get started: The meeting with the Community Director will be about how to prepare a room.
Report Room Condition Report findings: When reporting the Room Condition Report, if there is an item that needs to be replaced, the Resident Advisor must communicate with the Community Director in order to get a replacement item.
Finalize the checklist: By the time the building is ready to be inspected, there is about 3 weeks left until Freshmen Move In Day.
Attend Resident Advisor training: This is a two-week process that trains the Resident Advisor for almost any situation that may be encountered during the school year.

Prepare for move-in day: This is the busiest day of the year for all housing employees.
Implement training during the school year: Resident Advisors are expected to assist the Residents in every aspect throughout the entire course of both semesters, such as campus life, homework, and residential issues.
Schedule meetings: Every week, the Resident Advisors will have a meeting with their respective Community Directors.
Assign duty: Duty days are assigned to each Resident Advisor according to availability due to personal and school events.
Answer duty calls: When a resident calls the front desk to report an incident, the front desk staff immediately calls the Resident Advisor on Duty to respond to the problem.
Do rounds: Rounds only apply to the Resident Advisor on Duty.
Build community: Residents are encouraged to leave their doors open to make new friends, hang out in study lounges, and/or attend a program hosted by the Resident Advisors.
Speed up the move-out process: As the winter semester draws to an end and everybody is saying their goodbyes to their new friends, the Resident Advisors are responsible for checking the residents out of the building.

Drive a hoop (wicket) into the ground at the exact center of the field.
Decide which ends are "north" and "south".
Walk from the center hoop toward the north end of the field.
Place a hoop at this location.
Find the next hoop's location by walking an equal distance between the center and the south end.
Place another hoop slightly farther in the same direction.
Continue on the same short distance and place the south stake.
Mirror this setup on the north side.
Return to the center hoop and walk diagonally "southeast" to locate the next hoop.

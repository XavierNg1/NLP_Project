Keep all your clocks as correct as you can make them.
Stabilize your circadian rhythm.
Every time you think of it, guess to yourself what time it is.
Whenever you get a chance, check a clock and make note of the time.
When you start a task with a defined beginning and end (reading a chapter of a book, driving to a friend's house, taking a shower) guess how long it will take you.
When you start a task that has a specified time frame (like when cooking), set a timer for the upper end of the range given.
Record your progress in a time sense journal.

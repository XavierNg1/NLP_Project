Preheat your oven to 350ºF (180ºC).
Mix the flour, cinnamon, and salt, then add the water gradually.
Roll the dough out until it is ¼-inch to 1/3-inch (6.4 to 8.5 millimeters) thick.
Cut the dough using cookie cutters.
Poke a hole near the top of each ornament using a skewer or straw.
Transfer the ornaments to a baking sheet, and bake them for 7 to 10 minutes.
Let the ornaments cool, then decorate, if desired.
Tread a piece of string or ribbon through the hole at the top of the ornament, and secure it with a tight knot.
Finished.

Arrange the coefficients in a 3x3 matrix named D. The following steps explain this.Find the determinant of D and note down the value.
Find the value of variable x.Find the value of matrix D1 and note it down.
Find the value of variable y.Find the value of matrix D2 and note it down.
Find the value of variable z.Note down the value of D3.
Find the values of variables x, y and z. Divide D1/D to get the value of x, D2/D to get the value of y and D3/D to get the value of z.

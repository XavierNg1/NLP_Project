Lay out materials needed for the spa before you give the treatment.
The next thing you do is lay out a towel.
Then, you lay down a hot washcloth on the customer's face ( leave a hole for the mouth), and their feet.
Let the wash cloths sit for 5 - 10 minutes.

,
Take the wash cloths off, and massage lotion in the customer's hands, feet, legs, and arms.

,
Ask the customer if they would like their nails done.
Now, ask them if they want to have their hair done.
Next, you ask your customer if they want to have make up on.
Congratulations!

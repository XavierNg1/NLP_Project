Choose a material to make your mask out of.
Measure out how much fabric you'll need.
Cut out the mask.
It's completely optional, but you can embroider closed eyelids or something else on if you want.
Rub any chalk lines out and pin (use safety pins if you don't have sewing pins) the two fabrics together.
Get your straps.
Sew the eyemask like it is a pillow (there are many tutorials for making pillows).
Once it has dried or has all the pins out of it, try it on your Webkinz and go on being fabulous.

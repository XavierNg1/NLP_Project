Plan to waterproof your fabric on a dry, windless day.
Clean the fabric if it is dirty.
Make sure that the fabric is dry.
Transfer the fabric to a well-ventilated area.
Purchase a waterproofing spray and seam sealer.
Hold the can 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the surface of the fabric and apply the sealer in a light, even layer.
Wait about for the spray to dry, then apply a second coat.
Apply seam sealer to all of the seams.

Determine your lowest possible price and your target price before putting the car on the market.
Get the car checked out by a mechanic and fix any issues, as long as they are cheap enough to still resell at a profit.
Get the car as clean as you possibly can.
Show any obvious defects to the buyer, and include them in your ad.
Change the oil, radiator fluid, and wiper fluid if necessary to instantly raise the price.

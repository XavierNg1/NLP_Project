The first thing you need to do is go to: http://rstein.org.
Click on "Play Game" to start the game.
Set up two cannons in front of the hole where the ants come out, keeping them towards the edge.

,
Click on one of the cannons.
You should now have two Impact Cannons.
Save up enough money to add two more cannons ($167).
Upgrade these two into Quick Cannons 1 (Click the middle button).

,
Save up some more money ($160) and upgrade these into Quick Cannons 2 (Click on the first button).

,
Here's where it starts to get expensive.
Wait some more until you have $400.
Place two more cannons at the very edge of the screen next to the Impact Cannons.

,
Upgrade those all the way to Quick Cannons 3.

,
Now here comes the part you can't do in any other version.
By now you should be at about level 55.
Just to make sure all of the ants are constantly frozen, lets add another Ice Cannon 2 just above all of the other cannons.
That's it for the Ice Cannons.
Try different combinations and different places to put your cannons.

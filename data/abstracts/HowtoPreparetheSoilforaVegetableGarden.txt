Understand that it takes a couple of years to prepare your soil for optimal gardening.
Begin soil preparation by digging out the area of your vegetable garden.
Analyze the soil to determine its condition.
Cultivate the soil by turning it with a shovel or rototiller.
Mix some fertilizer into the soil to prepare it for growing vegetables successfully.
Add topsoil to the surface of your garden area.
Allow the cultivated soil to sit for a couple of days before planting.
Ideally you should prepare vegetable garden soil with compost 2 seasons ahead of the time you plant your vegetables.

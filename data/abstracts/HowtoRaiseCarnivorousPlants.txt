Find a good place to put the plant.
Water them often.
If you have purchased a plant from a local hardware store or nursery in a small pot with a dome over it, you will need to take steps to help it adjust to lower humidity.
Re-pot your plants every year for optimal growth, or whenever their current pot becomes too small.
Get a nutrient-free soil mix, consisting of 1 part peat moss and one part perlite.
Re-pot your carnivorous plants just as you would a normal plant: make sure to place it in the new pot to the same soil depth as in the old one.
Respect their dormancy!

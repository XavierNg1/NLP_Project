Apply a base coat.
After you are positive your base coat is dry, pick out your favorite color.
Next, get some tape and put it on your toe-nails.
Get the polish of your choice and add a little on the brush.
Allow your pedicure to dry before removing the tape.
Finally apply your top-coat to your toe-nails.
Finished.

Find the right partner.
Treat the object of your affection as though s/he were your own age.
Be fun, happy, and easy to talk to like any normal human being trying to make friends.
Once the 18-to-21-year-old recognizes your unusual respect and admiration, his/her thought process will wander down one of several unfamiliar paths: S/he may see you as a means of much longed-for escape from a comparatively juvenile world.
Alternatively, the teen may also find your respect frightening.
Suggest activities that the two of you can do together, that emphasize your shared traits and experiences.
Let them share their interests with you.
After a friendship grows, your love interest may have difficulty spending one-on-one time with you.
Be patient with the moral pressures that weigh on your love interest...show your disappointment but respect their moral concerns.

,
Once you are spending time alone together, be attuned to your love interest.
At some point in the relationship, your love-interest will either pull closer or pull away.
If s/he starts something physical, like a tickle-fight, a massage, or even just prolonged eye contact, then make a small move.

,
When you make your move, treat your teen like an adult.
If s/he still seems physically uncertain, then stick to verbal compliments, telling him/her how you feel, and start conversations about what the feelings mean.

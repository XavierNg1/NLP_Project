Check to make sure that they have a plumbing license.
Get two or more references and read online reviews.
Ask how long they have been in business for.
Get another bid/quote for the job but make sure you are comparing apples with apples.
Ask about their guarantee.
Finding a plumber who gives pricing for small jobs over the phone isn't necessarily the sign of a good plumber.
The real key is to get flat, fixed quotes so you know exactly what the plumber will do and exactly what you will pay.
Ask neighbors or nearby friends for plumbing referrals.
If you've had a good experience with another professional, such as an A/C repair technician, a roofer or an electrician, try asking them for a referral.

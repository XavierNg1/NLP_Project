You can do this party one of two ways:


Make it just like the show, and invite one of your friends/family members that makes fashion faux-pas a little too often, then surprise them by saying they they're going to get a fashion makeover!,
For both parties, assign your own family/friends to be the cast of "What not to Wear".
For both parties, decorate your house/party space just like the "What not to Wear" studio.
At the end of either party theme, eat cake/snacks, chat, dance, or do whatever you please now that everyone looks great, and you can go to bed knowing that you had a great party!

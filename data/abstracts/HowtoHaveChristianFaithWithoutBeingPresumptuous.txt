Realize that God is God and you are not in charge of the universe, God is.
Do not be judgmental of others.
Remember that prayer is about making requests, not telling God what to do.
Remember to stay humble when you pray.
Know that sometimes God does not want to give us what we want.
See the truth that God does not necessarily want you to be rich.
Realize that God is capable of healing anything or anyone he wants, but he is not always willing to.
Remember that God works all things together for good.

Confide in a true friend that you trust.
Play it safe by ending the relationship gently.
Drift away from the friendship if youâ€™re non-confrontational.
Confront the frenemy if you want to be direct.
Expect your frenemy to be surprised or in denial if you confront them.
Grieve and then move forward.

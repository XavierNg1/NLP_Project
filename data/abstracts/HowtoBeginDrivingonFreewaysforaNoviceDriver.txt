Pick a highway and a time.
Learn to operate the car at lower speeds first.
Make sure your car's brakes, lights, turn signals, steering, transmission and all other parts are working safely.
Start on a day when the weather is clear and dry.
Start driving from your driveway, then head for the freeway on-ramp.
As you come up the on-ramp, use your turn signal, check your blind spot and mirrors, look forward again and merge onto the highway.
Practice changing lanes as you cruise down the highway.
Once you're comfortable changing lanes, try passing other cars.
When you're ready to get off the highway, find an appropriate off-ramp and get in the correct lane, using the steps to change lanes.
Once you're off the highway, you can go home, or look for another on-ramp and practice more highway driving.

Use fins on your feet.
Hold your arms at your sides to reduce drag and extend your legs so that the fins are pointed behind you.
With your knees slightly bent, kick slowly and powerfully with the fins.
Kick farther down and less upwards whilst arching your back upward.
Keep your fins below the water when kicking.
Float with the waves.
Swim at a steady comfortable pace to conserve your energy.

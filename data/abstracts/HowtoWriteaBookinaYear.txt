Buy a binder and some dividers.
Label a divider "outlines.",
If you want (this also will help) take another sheet of paper and outline each chapter on its own sheet, as well as on the other sheet, in more detail.
Label another divider "Schedule.",
Set a goal for each amount of free time you have.
Watch movies and read bestselling books in the same genre as you book to get inspired.
Create a map of the world your characters live in.
Know what audience you are writing for.
Make the beginning of your book as captivating as the climax.
Try to stay on schedule as much as you can.
Write daily.
Take needed breaks.
Always be ready for criticism.
Be ready to be shot down.
Never send your entire manuscript to a publisher all at once.
Done.

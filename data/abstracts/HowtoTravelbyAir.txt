The first step to travelling by plane is the packing.
Bring important documents.
Try to check in online or on your phone, as this means that you have the chance to make multiple copies of boarding passes as backups and makes it a lot easier and a lot less stressful when you get to the actual airport.
Dress appropriately for safety and security.
Keep clothing loose but warm.
Keep carry-on items to a minimum.
Take your own pillow and blanket.
Bring a few health items.
When you are traveling overseas on a night flight, Sleep!,
Bring your own meal or snacks.
Stay hydrated.

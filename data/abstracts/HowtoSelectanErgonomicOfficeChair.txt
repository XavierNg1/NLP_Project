Understand the importance of having chairs that are ergonomic.
Check the height.
Check the width and depth.
Check the lumbar support.
Check the back.
If you find any of these features missing or just plain not working, then you should either return the chair in exchange for another kind of chair, or you can exchange the defective one for one that does serve its function well as an ergonomic piece of office furniture.

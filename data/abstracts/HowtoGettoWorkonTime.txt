Plan your working day in advance.
Set your alarm the night before and use it as a wake up call.
Get up with a good few hours before you're due to be at work.
Order a cab if you have to.
Have breakfast and splash your face with cold water, this will help you function normally.
Be ready for the taxi or transportation when it gets there.
Follow these steps every working day and they will become a habit.

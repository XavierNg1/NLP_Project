Recognize that it isn't your fault that your parents are having problems.
Your parents feelings are not your responsibility.
During the divorce; if you are old enough, the judge may ask you some questions about your home life with each parent, and your thoughts and personal preference.
Once you know who you are staying with, enjoy your time with your other parent for the time being.
Accept it!,
Contribute to the decisions.
Make sure you're speaking up for yourself.
Find someone to talk to.
Also, you may notice that your parents will be busy....especially with what is going on.

Decide on a design for your puff sleeve pattern.
Take measurements.
Add 1 inch (2.54 cm) to the circumference measurements and 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) to the length measurements to account for the seam allowances and the hem.

,
Make a pattern.
Lay your pattern out on a double layer of fabric (for 2 puff sleeves) and pin into place.

,
Cut out your pattern, being sure to cut through both layers of fabric.

,
Mark the center point of the sleeve seam (at the top of the bell shape) and mark where on the bell you want your gathering to begin and end.

,
Fold each pattern piece in half, right side in, along the vertical center point line from shoulder to hem.

,
Sew puff sleeves from the armpit seam line to the hem, creating the basic sleeve cylinder.

,
Turn out the sleeves so they are right side out.

,
Baste stitch, by hand, around the perimeter of the bell shape of the puffy sleeve pattern where you want the gathering to be.

,
Gather the basting stitch until it fits inside the sleeve opening of the shirt you will be sewing it into.
Pin the puff sleeves into the shirt.
Sew puff sleeves.
Finish the sleeve hems.

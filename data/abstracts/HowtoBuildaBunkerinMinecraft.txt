Dig downwards.

Hollow out a space to stay in.

Place a nether portal in one of the walls.

Fill in the shaft to the surface and place a second nether portal on the surface.

Go through the top portal and dig a tunnel in the nether that links the top and bottom portals.
Go through the portals and into your bunker.

Decorate your bunker walls to make it more homely.

Add survival systems to your bunker.
Congrats!

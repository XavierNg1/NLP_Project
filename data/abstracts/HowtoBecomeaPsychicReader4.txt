Be aware of your surroundings.
Slow your thinking down.
Accept the diversity of forms in which a clairvoyant vision may arrive.You may experience a premonition, knowledge about a particular situation or event occurring now or in the future, contact with a god or goddess, or the ability to see a physical aura around certain individuals which indicates their mood or attitude.
Record any visions or hunches you feel throughout the day.

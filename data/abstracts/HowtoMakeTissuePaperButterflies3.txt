Cut out your butterfly template out of a sheet of paper.
Fold a stack of tissue paper in half and tuck it inside the folded butterfly, like a hot dog.
Cut the tissue paper, using your template as a guide.
Make the bodies of the butterflies using pipe cleaners.
Stack three tissue paper butterflies, one of top of each other.
Tuck the stack inside one of the bent pipe cleaners and twist it shut.
Gently fluff the wings up.
Attach the butterflies to the garland.
Keep assembling and attach your butterflies until you have as many as you like on your garland.

Obtain a suitable plastic barrel, large plastic trash can with a lid, or a wooden barrel (e.g. a wine barrel) that has not been stored dry for too many seasons since they can start to leak.
Find a location for the barrel under or near one of your home's downspouts.
Create a level, stable platform for your rain barrel by raking the dirt, adding gravel, or using some bricks or concrete blocks to make a low platform for it to sit on.
If your barrel has a solid top, you'll need to make a hole of a suitable size for the downspout to pour into.
To reduce the risk of breeding mosquitoes and to keep debris from the roof from entering the rain barrel, fasten a piece of window screen to the underside of the barrels top surface around the water inlet.

,
Drill a hole of the correct size based on the hose bib you're installing on the side of the barrel, as close to the bottom as possible unless you plan to run PVC piping inside the barrel to a location near the top.
Attach a second hose bib to the side of the barrel near the top, to act as an "overflow".
Attach a garden hose to the lower hose bib and open the valve to allow collected rainwater to flow to your plants!,
Consider using a drip irrigation system in conjunction with the rain barrels.

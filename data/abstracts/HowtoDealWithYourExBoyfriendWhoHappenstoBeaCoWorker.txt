Know how you feel about your ex.
Decide where you stand with your ex.
Don't talk about your relationship with your ex at work.
Do not, by any means, discuss your relationship with everyone at work or say any bad things about your ex behind their back.
Consider and learn to accept the fact that you, or your ex, might date a fellow employee someday.
If your ex's parents or friends or people you have met through your ex-boyfriend show up at work, say hello and be professional.
As hard as it might be, be polite and kind towards your ex.
If your ex-boyfriend ignores you completely at work, follow suit.
Don't play games.
Let time heal you.

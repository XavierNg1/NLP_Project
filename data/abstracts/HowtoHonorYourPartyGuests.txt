When your guests arrive, greet them warmly at the door - take their jackets and compliment their appearance.
When introducing them to one another, add a small piece of personal information about them.
When you are planning a menu (a meal or just snacks), make sure you consider your guests dietary needs, even if it means offering an alternative dish - the thought will go far and will leave a much more pleasant feeling than an empty belly.
Same considerations should be shown for beverages.
Make an inclusive toast that mentions the friendships in the room.
At the end of the meal/party, present each guest with a token favour.
Ensure each guest takes their coat and bag.
Ensure they have a safe way to get home.
Finally thank them for coming.

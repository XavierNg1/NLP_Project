Escape from the rapist and go to a safe location, such as a friend or family member's house.
Keep all evidence intact.
Call a local law enforcement agency, your local rape crisis center or victim's rights group.
Get a medical exam.
Once you have a doctor or police officer's approval, go home, shower and rest.
Seek counseling from a therapist or family doctor.
Don't blame yourself.

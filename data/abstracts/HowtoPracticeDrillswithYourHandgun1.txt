You should be able to load your gun quickly 100% of the time â€” without looking at your pistol, your hands, or your magazines.
Emergency reload is the reload in which you have spent all the rounds from your magazine and your slide is locked back.
Tactical reload is the reload in which you encounter a lull in the gunfight and are able to place yourself behind cover.
You should be practiced enough that when you are shooting (no matter how many rounds are in the magazine), you should be able to feel when the handgun is empty.

Rip all of the pages out of 3 magazines.
Gather glue sticks.
Fold 1 magazine page in half lengthwise and then unfold it so that you can see the crease.
Apply a hefty amount of glue to the inside of the magazine paper that shows the folds.
Fold another piece of magazine paper as you did before.
Continue folding magazine pages, gluing them, wrapping them around the spiral and taping the end until you think you reach the size of the bowl you want.
Pull up on the sides of the spiral to form a bowl shape.
Use decoupage glue or varnish on the inside and outside of the bowl and allow it to dry.

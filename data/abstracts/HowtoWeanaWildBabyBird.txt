Start leaving small dishes of food and water for the bird.
Feed the bird from the dish.
Once the bird is eating on its own, start decreasing the amount of food you hand feed it.
After a couple of weeks, the baby bird will be eating independently.
Around this time it will also need to learn how to drink water.

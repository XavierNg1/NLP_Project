Review the events of your story to see how they connect.
Ask yourself: “What happens next?” Sometimes when we get too excited (or too frustrated) about a story we're writing, we can forget that events and behaviors, even in a fantasy world, tend to follow logic, the physical laws of the universe you're imagining, etc.
Ask yourself: “Why are these events in this order?” Review the sequence of events or actions in the story, then question actions that seem surprising in order to clarify the logic and flow of your story.
Imagine variations and surprises.
Raise a question based on where the story has brought you.
Think like an outsider.

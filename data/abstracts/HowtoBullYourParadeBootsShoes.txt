Gather your supplies and find a good area to get to work.
Clean your boots first.
Prepare to polish.
Use the polishing cloth with one finger to apply a very thin layer of polish onto the boot.

,
Leave the polish to dry on the boot.
Once the polish is dry, use the remover brush to gently brush over the polish.
Find a sponge and use the same motion you used with the brush on the sponge.

,
Get another good quality polishing cloth or chamois cloth.
Get hold of two opposite corners of the cloth.
Keep going as needed.

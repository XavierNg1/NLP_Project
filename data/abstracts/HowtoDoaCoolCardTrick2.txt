Fan out your cards face down to a spectator and ask him/her to point to one.
Pinch the bottom right corner with your index and middle finger.
Put the card back in the deck or ask a spectator to.
When the cards are all back in your hands, discreetly look for a card that is slightly bent.
Show the spectator his or her card.

Arms: Biceps worked both from and to the heart several times over.
Thighs: Top of legs, to and from the heart, you can face your body to their face and turn toward their feet when you change direction to make it easier for you.
Have them turn over to face down.

Start again with their legs straight, knee to hip, and then hip to knee and back to hip.
Hips again now, if no underwear, uncover just one hip and work on separate to and from heart slowly clearing deeper each time.

Now move to the back, warm with lotion or oil feeling for tight areas to concentrate on and them have them scoot down and turn to a side.
You can work through hip again from this angle too, then to have them turn over to repeat on other side.

When done with that side, have them face down again to work through their entire back again and finish with the shoulders and neck,to help maintain a relaxed state.

You can have them flip over one more time to face upwards, and finish with the muscles of the jaw, face and head.

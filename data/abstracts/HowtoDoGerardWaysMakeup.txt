Round up your supplies!,
Begin by applying white makeup on your face.
Once done with the white makeup, (wait until it dries if you used liquid), apply your eyeliner.
Smudge the eyeliner around (this is only one option, go to the next step if you would rather use a bit of color.),
This is for those who didn't choose to smudge their eyeliner.
Apply the eyeshadow of your choice.
(This step is optional.),
Another thing you can do, is, one you have applied your white foundation, put tape, (Masking tape), on your face, so that you can see.
Do your hair!,
Do your nails too!

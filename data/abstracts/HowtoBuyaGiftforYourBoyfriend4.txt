Keep it a surprise.Presents are best if the other person doesn't know what it is yet.
Include a romantic letter or card.Even if you're not a particularly skilled writer, there's a certain beauty in trying to describe your feelings for your significant other on paper.
Wait for a special moment.You want to present your gift at a point where the two of you are relaxed and things are pleasant.
Tell him to wait while you retrieve the gift.
Give him the gift.
Sweeten the deal by getting romantic.

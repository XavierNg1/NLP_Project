Don’t try to pop your pimple.
Apply a warm compress to an area that is sore and may be breaking out.
Wash your whole face with a mild cleansing agent containing salicylic acid.This will help to rid your face of dead skin cells and excess oil, thereby diminishing the severity of the pimple that is forming.
Don’t wear makeup on the area until it is absolutely necessary to cover it up.

Take four steps forward.
Nod your head to one side.
Turn to the side and put your arms out.
Put your hands into claw-like forms.
Stand straight.
Bend over.
Clap your hands over your head.
Improvise during the pause.
Walk forward for three counts.
Jump!,
Turn your head four times.
Rip up some old clothes.
Make your hair untidy.
Wear zombie makeup.
Put on fake blood.
Gather a group of friends.
Learn the lyrics to Thriller.
Play the music.
Perform at a party or event.

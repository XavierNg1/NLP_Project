Put a football on the tee about on a 75 degree angle and face the laces away from you.
Make sure the ball is always going to be in the middle of tee (make sure ball is still leaning).

,
Practice.
Put your hand down after a second or two than start jogging to ball, after that once your a couple steps away you start running and you kick the ball with your "toes".

,
If your coach wants you to kick high, then get your foot more under the ball.
Build leg strength.

Go to the World menu.
Scroll through the menu until you see the icon of a pond.
Click the right arrow to increase your chances of finding a pond to either “More” or “Lots.” The “More” option simply makes your ponds more accessible and plentiful, while the “Lots” options would place them nearly everywhere.
Exit the menu and start playing the game.

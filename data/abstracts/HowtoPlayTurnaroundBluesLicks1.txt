Start your lick with a big, thumping root note by hitting the open 6th string.
Slide into a triad on the bottom three strings.
Strum this little triad six times, in total.
Slide out of the triad into an open 3rd string G. Slide back towards the head, releasing your fingers as you hit the 2nd fret (as indicated in the tab by the "4/2") and strumming an open G string.
End the first bar with a return to the root note.
Walk your way through the final measure to turn the progression around.
Put the whole thing together in a real song.

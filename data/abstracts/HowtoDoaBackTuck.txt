Stretch out your muscles.
Practice doing it in your mind.
Get a spotter.
Get a mat.
Start with your arms up and your body completely straight.
Lower your arms, bend your knees, and then swing your arms back up as you jump straight up into the air.
Tuck your legs as you jump up into the air.
Tuck yourself into a little ball in the middle of your mid-air jump.
Land with your knees bent.
Snap up with your body into starting position right after you land.
Practice the whole thing by putting all the parts together.

Use a hygrometer to gain an accurate humidity reading of the room or area you want to dehumidify.
Use specific characteristics of the room to determine its humidity levels if you do not have access to a hygrometer.
Determine your air changes per hour (ACH) to calculate the airflow needed to properly dehumidify your room.
Calculate the amount of square feet present in the room or area that you need to dehumidify.
Calculate the amount of cubic feet in the room you need to dehumidify by taking the height of the room and multiplying that value by the amount of square feet.
Determine the amount of airflow or cubic feet per minute (CFM) you will need in order to dehumidify the room using your cubic feet and ACH values.
Determine the pints of moisture you need extracted from the air on a daily basis to properly dehumidify your room.
Buy a dehumidifier that can support your CFM and pints requirements.

Classification:
Fire Resistive construction is ISO Class 6.
Building elements:
The exterior bearing walls and load-bearing portions of exterior walls must be of noncombustible materials or of masonry, but exterior nonbearing walls and wall panels may be slow-burning, combustible, or with no fire-resistance rating.
Variations:
Both pre- and post-tensioned concrete units have steel cables installed in the concrete to provide tensile strength.
Advantages:


uses noncombustible materials
allows greater height and area than other construction classes
uses load-bearing members or assemblies that resist damage from fire

,
Disadvantages:


expensive to construct and repair
provides a false sense of security

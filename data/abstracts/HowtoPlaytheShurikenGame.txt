Gather the materials in "Things You'll Need" found below.
Before the game starts, give each player x number of shuriken they can hold.
Use the Element of Substitution.
If you are able to catch a launched shuriken, you are not out and can use the shuriken.
Know that a shuriken on the floor may or may not be picked up off the floor, based on the game style: SHURIKEN RETRIEVAL or NO SHURIKEN RETRIEVAL.
No human contact is permitted.

Don’t be afraid.Some parents may be hesitant to ask for help because they don’t speak English or think the teacher will look down on them.If you need help, and think the teacher can provide it, then don’t be afraid to ask!,
Contact the teacher as soon as you realize you need help.
Figure out what type of help you need.
Contact the teacher at the right time.Even though teachers can be a great place to turn when you need help, teachers are very busy throughout the school day.

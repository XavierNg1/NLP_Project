Plant a cutting.
Grow from seed.
Purchase ficus ginseng bonsai as an already growing plant.
Grow the plant indoors.
Ensure plenty of light.
Keep the temperature relatively constant.
Water the ficus normally.
 Fertilize weekly or every two weeks during summer.
Prune often.
Prune back to two leaves after six to eight leaves have grown.

Try some special training techniques:


Ficus has the ability to fuse plant parts which touch each other with some pressure.
For faster closing of large wounds young plants, shoots or aerial roots can be grafted across the wound.
Use the roots as part of the designing.
 Repot the tree during spring every other year.

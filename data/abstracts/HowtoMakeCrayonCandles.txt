Measure out enough wax to fill your candle holder, plus some extra and set it aside.
Peel a crayon.
Break the crayon into smaller pieces and set them aside.
Place a tabbed wick in the middle of the glass candle holder and secure it with a drop of hot wax.You can also use a drop of super glue or a piece of double-sided tape.
Place two sticks to either side of the wick to hold it steady.
Set up a double boiler.
Place the crayons and wax into the glass measuring cup.
Melt the crayon and wax over medium heat, stirring often.
Take the measuring cup out of the water using an oven mitt or pot holder.
Consider adding some fragrance.
Pour melted wax/crayon mixture into candle holder.
Let the candle harden before adding other colors and layers.If you add the second layer too soon, it will mix into the first one, and you might end up with an ugly color.
Wait for the candle to harden completely before using it.
Trim the wick down to Â¼ inch (0.64 centimeters).
Finished.

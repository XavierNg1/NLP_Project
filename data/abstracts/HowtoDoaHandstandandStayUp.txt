Lock your elbows.
Start by doing some high kicks.
Get to the handstand position.
Establish which foot is more comfortable to start tricks with.
Put your dominant foot in front and put your arms straight up above your ears, and make sure they are locked tight.

,
Begin to bend straight forward letting your non-dominant foot raise with your body.
Now that you are in the handstand, avoid these common mistakes:

,
Keep your arms close to your ears and try not to move your head.Squeeze your bottom in and tighten your stomach, this will not only keep you in a straight line instead of arching, but it will also tighten your handstand to make it look more presentable

,
Keep your legs firmly together and completely straight, with your toes pointed.

,
Always remember that if you start to fall down, go with it, or you might injure yourself.
Always pull your pants up ahead of time, doing this will decrease the risk of embarrassment.
Remember, you may not get it on the first try.
Note that like any gymnastics skill, a handstand takes a little bit of practice.
Finished.

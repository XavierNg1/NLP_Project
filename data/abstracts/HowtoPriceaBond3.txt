Know your bond’s “face value.” The face value (or par value) is the amount that the bond pays at maturity.
Understand your “coupon payment.” The coupon payment is the amount the bond pays periodically in interest.
Find out your bond’s “coupon yield.” The coupon yield is the annual coupon payment expressed as a percentage of the bond’s face value.
Measure your bond’s “current yield.” The current yield is the annual coupon payment amount divided by the current bond price.
Find the bond’s “yield to maturity.” A bond’s yield to maturity is defined as the discount rate that yields the market price of the bond.
Look up the bond rating.
Consider whether a bond is at a discount, at par, or at a premium.

If you are using a mixer to knead the MMF, put the marshmallows, and water in the mixer bowl and place over a pan of hot water, make sure that the bowl is not touching the water.
If you intend to knead the MMF by hand then place the marshmallows and water in the microwave for a half a minute, just long enough to melt them, if they are still not melted pub back in for five seconds and repeat this until they are melted.
Add the confectionersâ€™ sugar one cup at a time, and fold in until the mixture is not sticky before adding the next cup.
The whole process of kneading working the dough and adding the sugar should take about seven or eight minutes by hand.

Find a friend or garden with a Mother-of-Thousands plant.
Pick some plantlets.
Store the plantlets in a plastic bag.
Fill a shallow bowl with potting soil.
Place the plantlets gently on the surface of the soil, approximately three quarters of an inch (2 centimeters) to one inch (2.5 centimeters) apart.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.
Take the plantlets to a sunny place.
Keep the soil moist, not wet.
Wait, monitor and observe.
Remove the plastic wrap from the bowl when the plants are too tall for it.
Replant to more appropriate pots or bowls when the plantlets have grown significant roots.
Enjoy your newly-propagated Mother-of-Thousands!

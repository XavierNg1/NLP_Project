Do some research!,
Calm down.
Expect the worst!,
Don't blurt it out!,
Make your crush think twice.
Stay happy.
Be honest, but don't feel like you're in court.
Know your crush's reaction.
Don't apologize.
Remember that the words for now come out of their mouth, it doesn't mean a definite later.
If the answer is yes, go on with everyday life the exact same way it is.

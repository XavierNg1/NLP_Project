Take notes on all the details that your child’s previous caregivers tell you about his or her birth and early life.
Select a scrapbook or blank book to use for this purpose.
Put the book together as soon as possible after your child arrives, while the details of your adoption journey are fresh in your mind.
Write out your child’s story, told from her perspective.
You may want to make a color copy of the book so that your child can carry it around and read it, and not have to worry about wear and tear on the original.

,
Read the book to your child regularly.
Allow your child to show their book with others, but don’t force it.

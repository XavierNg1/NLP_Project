First you need to look at what you're trying to work out.
Once you have these you need to introduce slack variables into the inequalities.
The constraint should be in the form P=x+y(+z) which you need to rearrange to become 0=P-x-y(-z).
Once you have your data you need to construct the tableau.
You then need to put your data into the tableau.
Now the fun bit.
At this point you need to draw a line in your tableau so you can write in the first iteration.
You now need to make all the values in the x column (apart from your pivot line) equal to 0.
If you still have negative numbers on your top row (not including column l) repeat steps 6-8 until all your top row are positive.
You read the solution of your simplex problem very simply.

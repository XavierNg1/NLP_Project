Make sure that the ice-maker is turned off.
Remove the quarter-inch hex screw on the right side of the ice tray and pull the shelf out.
Find the wire harness.
Flip the ice-maker upside down.
Put the bottom assembly you just took off onto your new ice-maker.
Stand your newly assembled ice machine on end, so that you can connect the wire harness.
Done.

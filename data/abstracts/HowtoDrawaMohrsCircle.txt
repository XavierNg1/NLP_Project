Draw two perpendicular lines.
Label the intersection of the coordinates, i.e.
Mark off both sigma "x" and sigma "y" to some scale on the Normal Stress axis on your drawing sheet.
Divide the tangential force acting on the body by the area to calculate the shear stress on the body.
Draw a vertical line from "J" towards the positive (upwards) side and mark on it the value of the calculated shear stress.
Join points "D" and "E".
To find the values of the stress on a plane at any angle from the axis of the force, draw a radius CP at twice that angle, the angle being measured from the radius CE.

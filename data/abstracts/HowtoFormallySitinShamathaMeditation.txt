For a formal sitting pick a length of time to sit.
In the formal sitting: assume a relaxed and upright posture.
Initially select a place to sit where you will not be interrupted for your selected time period.
When you sit down, rest your hands on your thighs; so that your fingers come right up to your knees.
First: complete relaxation is critical.
Rest your gaze directly in front of you.
As you have settled into your posture you then begin the practice by resting your attention on the breath.
As you sit with your attention resting on the breath, your mind will wander.
It helps to have a pattern you can follow from your "Ding!",
In between the out breaths you can explore all the other ways you are resting in the formal meditation setting.
End significantly.

Above all, be happy with yourself as a person.
Being yourself.
Not caring what people think.
If you are truly, truly, unhappy with yourself, sometimes one of the best solutions is to make a change.
Sometimes, your unhappiness is being brought on unintentionally by yourself.
The final step, is to just relax.

Remember that writing is meant to be shared.
Don't defend or explain your work.
Never blame someone who "doesn't get it," for being too dumb to understand.
Recognize that people naturally focus on the negatives, and that's a good thing.
Realize that none of this is personal.
Remember that, in the end, your opinion is the one that matters the most.

Form-flattering clothes are the way to go.
You don't need designer clothing or whatever is cool.
Look for good deals, and if you really want designer clothes, but can't afford them, buy knock-offs.
Keep the clothes age-appropriate.
Don't wear the same outfits all the time; mix and match!

,
Wear things that work well together.
Accessorise!,
Wash your clothes when you're done wearing them; if your clothes look dirty, or haven't been washed in a while, then it gives you a sloppy look.

,
Wear clothes that fit.
Dress for the occasion.
Even if you have no interest in fashion whatsoever, try to wear nice clothes.
Make sure your clothes look good on you.

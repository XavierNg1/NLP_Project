Research the price of an item before you put it up for an auction and before you buy it.
Get an Auction Management Service to simplify the process.
Avoid reserves if possible: bidders will try to bid just enough to meet the reserve without going over; this could discourage some bidders.
Start bidders early: If you have any past customers email them.
Cross-reference all of your auctions: In all of your auctions you will need to make mention of the other auctions you have running at the same time.

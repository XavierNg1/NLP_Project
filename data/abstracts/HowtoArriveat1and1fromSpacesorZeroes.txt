Investigate the steps of the Theory of Neutral Operations as they apply to spaces or zeroes arriving at negative and positive 1, from the point of view of an early Universe trying to create something from nothing (purely logically).
Let there be at least 3 spaces (or zeroes), such that O>0>o and all are unequal or equal to the Null Set, {Ã¸}, i.e.
Notice that sometimes O+o = 0, that is when two spaces sum to make a third space.
Regard that stating "what is noticed" sounds like one is talking about an Awareness in the Primordial Universe.
Now do the Neutral Operation O+o = O*o = 0.Do O+o-o = (O*o)-o by subtracting o from both sides of the equation.
Do O = o*(O-1)... an admittedly great step for the Universe to take, to factor out o on the right after simplifying the left, but Nature has a way of trying all possibilities, so consider it at least a possibility.
Do O:o = O/o = (O-1) .... now here is taken a step not taken with a and b.Do O:o - O = O/o - O = -1 and negative 1 has been isolated and defined.
Do O - O:o = O - O/o = +1 after multiplying through by negative 1, and the result is positive 1 has been isolated and defined.

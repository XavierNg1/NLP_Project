Preheat the oven to 500 F (260 C).
Combine 1/4 cup of the flour, the water, yeast, and salt in a large bowl.
Gradually add the remaining flour.
Add the oil and honey.
Knead the dough.
Add a few drops of oil to a clean mixing bowl, and spread it all over the sides.
Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap.
Knead the dough a second time, for just a few minutes.
Spread the dough circles onto an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake for about 3 minutes, or until the bread is nicely browned.

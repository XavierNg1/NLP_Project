Fish with the guides aligned to reduce wear on your line.
Avoid banging your rod on the boat, rocks or other surfaces.
Clean your rod with a cloth, lukewarm water and vinegar or mild detergent every time you finish fishing.
Rub the rod's joints with candle wax or paraffin to prevent friction.
Wear gloves while you fish if your rod has a cork handle.
Fill small holes with a mixture of cork filings and wood glue or wood putty.

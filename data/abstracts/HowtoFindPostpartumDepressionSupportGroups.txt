Figure out whether you have postpartum depression or just the “baby blues.” Although you should seek the evaluation of a health professional, you may be able to determine whether your symptoms are a passing phase or a more permanent state of mind.
Discuss your feelings and worries with family and friends.
Enquire within your community.
Make sure you like the group you have found; if not, continue the search until you find a support group that makes you feel comfortable and safe.

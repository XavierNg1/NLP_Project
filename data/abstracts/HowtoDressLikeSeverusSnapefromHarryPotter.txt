Watch and make notes on Alan Rickman in the Harry Potter movies.
Grow your hair to your shoulders and dye it jet-black.
Go for a pale, almost sickly complexion.
Work on your glare.
When talking to others, draw yourself to your full height and loom over them like a "giant, overgrown bat".

,
Wear long black robes all the time.
Tattoo the "Dark Mark" on your left forearm.
Talk in a low voice; it must be silky and smooth, but not whisper-like.
Be formal: Snape's formality and dignity are imperturbable, his sarcasm is always from a superior, critical position.
If you do talk, however, keep it to non-personal subjects and never get emotional.

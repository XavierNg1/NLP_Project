Have the players sit in a circle and begin to count in turn, but when the number 7 or any number in which the figure 7 or any multiple of 7 is reached, they say "Buzz," instead of whatever the number may be.
If one of the players forgets to say "Buzz" at the proper time, he is out.

Start again when someone is out.

Live simply.
Use your meal plan to its fullest, if you have one.
Don't have parties; go to parties.
Don't take a car to college.
Consider buying used or rental books.
If living off-campus, split rent with other roommates.
If you must buy groceries, consider stores with lower prices such as Walmart or Kroger (using a savings card).
If living on-campus, pick a housing option you can afford.

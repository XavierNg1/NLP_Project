Collect watermelon seeds from ripe, healthy watermelons.
Do not collect seeds from watermelons growing on vines that have wilting, spotted or dying leaves or vines.
Use seeds from watermelons that have not been grown in a garden with a different watermelon cultivar.
Avoid putting salt on the watermelon if you are going to collect the seeds.
Put the watermelon seeds into a glass or plastic container and fill the container with water.
On the third or fourth day, pour out the water and any seeds that are floating at the top.
Fill the container with fresh water, swish the seeds around and pour the water out several times.
Remove the seeds from the container with a spoon or by pouring them into a colander.
Put the clean, dry seeds into an air-tight container.
Use a pen or marker to label the container along with the year the seeds were processed.
Start watermelon seeds indoors in peat pots.
Plant the seedlings in the garden two weeks after the last hard frost.
Enjoy ripe watermelons in the summer.

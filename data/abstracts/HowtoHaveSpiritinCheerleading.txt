Assess your spirit level.
If the teams you cheer for (usually basketball and football) outright suck, you need to understand that not everyone can be on top of their game all the time.
To be more peppy for games, and energetic for practices, make sure you eat a good breakfast.
Practice!,
Overact Many girls do not show much pep because they are afraid of looking dumb.
During games, yell chants and cheers.

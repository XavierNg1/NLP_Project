To be discussed are the 5 basic Neutral Operations:

1) a+b = a*b = c;
2) a-b = a*b = c;
3) a+b = a/b = c;
4) a-b = a/b = c; and
5) a*b = a^b = c.
In previous wikiHows, more complicated relations have been solved, e.g.
The first equation neutralizes Addition versus Multiplication, i.e.
The second equation neutralizes Subtraction versus Multiplication and is handled in much the same way as the first.
The third equation is handled somewhat differently when neutralizing Addition versus Division.
The fourth principle equation, neutralizing Subtraction versus Division, operates much like the third where we lose some discretion.
Lastly, we have the principle neutral operation of a*b = a^b, which may be written down and learned from as follows:

1) a*b = a^b;
2) ab/a = (a^b)/a;
3) b = a^(b-1);
4) The root of (b-1) is taken of both sides so that b^(1/(b-1)) = a and a has been isolated and defined in terms of b and 1.
Many other side-excursions are possible, e,g, a+b = -a/b, etc, etc.

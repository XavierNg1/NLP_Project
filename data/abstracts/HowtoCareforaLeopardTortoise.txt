Buy a healthy tortoise - if you know of a reliable, reputable pet store that specializes in reptiles, they may have one for you.
Create a natural habitat - the Leopard tortoise is found natively throughout south and east Africa.
Create an outdoor captive habitat - if you live in a warm, dry climate similar to that described above, you are poised to emulate the tortoise's natural habitat by building an outdoor pen for your new pet.
Create an indoor captive habitat - avoid the use of an aquarium since they do not offer enough horizontal space for your tortoise to roam about in.
Provide suitable food - the leopard tortoise feeds primarily on grasses in the wild.
Select appropriate heat and light - your tortoise will need two main sources of light for daylight and heat.
Provide appropriate supplements - a supplement that can be fed to the tortoise is the Mazuri tortoise food.
Enable socialization - tortoises are mostly solitary animals in the wild, but they are not opposed to a little attention once in a while, especially when they get older.

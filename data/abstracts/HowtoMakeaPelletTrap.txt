Decide on the size of your trap.
Cut the wood you choose (Use 1" X 4" strips) to fit.
You will want some sort of backing -- Luan Plywood or something like that is more than sufficient.
Assemble the box.
Once you have all four corners done, you will have an open box.
Fill the box with one layer of duct seal.
Mount a clip to hold the targets.

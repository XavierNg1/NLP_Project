Know that boys will probably like talking to you.
Take a deep breath before talking to that cute boy.
If you freak out too much when talking to a cute boy, then try talking to a nice, average-looking guy first.
Offer compliments and ask him questions about himself.
Ask him about the clothes he's wearing.
Look at their faces or at their lips if you can't focus on their eyes.
Think about becoming friends with the boys first.
Focus on other things in your life other than boys or looks.
Make sure you're confident.
Be nice.
Don't annoy the boys you are hanging around with.
Understand it may take a while to become comfortable around boys.
Be fun.
Remember, boys are just as nervous as you are.
Smile.

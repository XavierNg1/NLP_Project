Groom yourself.
Prep your lips.
Freshen your breath.
Minimize distractions.
Read the mood.
Move in close.
Build the tension.
Test the waters.
Keep going.
Take your time.
Keep reading the mood.
Vary your speed.
Open your lips.
Tease with your tongue.
Use a little more tongue.
Try a little nibbling and sucking.
Use your hands.
Move past the lips.
Let the kiss take control.

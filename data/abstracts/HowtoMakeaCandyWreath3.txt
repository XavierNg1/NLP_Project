Cut 4 feet (1.22 meters) of 22-gauge floral wire and bend it in half twice.
Wrap the wire around the top of a 16-inch (40.64 centimeters) Styrofoam ring to make the hanger.
Lay a piece of cardboard or foamcore on your work surface.
Attach two pieces of candy to a greening pin.
Line the inside of the Styrofoam ring with the prepared candies.
Prepare more candies, then start pinning them to the outside of the Styrofoam wreath.
Fill any gaps with individual candies.
Attach a bow near the top or bottom of the wreath.
Thread some more ribbon through the top of the bow and tie it into a loop.

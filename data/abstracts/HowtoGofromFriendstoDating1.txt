Think about where your friendship currently stands.
Build trust together, even if it is only a little bit.
Ask a mutual friend for their opinion.
Avoid talking excessively about past relationships or other crushes.
Remember that relationships are about more than physical attraction.
Spend time alone to see if you make a good couple.

This step is optional, but beneficial, prime your eyes.

Now, to add depth and definition, sweep the darkest shadow into your crease (the "sinking" place just above your eyelid).
Make sure the eyeliner color matches your eyeshadow and your complexion.
Curl your eyelashes if desired.

Mascara!,
Separate your eyelashes with an eyelash/fine-tooth comb.
Check everything.

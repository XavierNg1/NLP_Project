Choose your words very carefully upon learning that a friend is in an abusive situation.
Listen and be there.
Ask questions to elicit the story, the feelings and the things you need to know.
Keep listening and asking open-ended or thought-provoking questions.
Consider finding suitable pamphlets, booklets, online information that contains help for your friend.
Get another source to reinforce your message.
Act as soon as you can, and do not ever give up.

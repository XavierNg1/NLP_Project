Buy or find a stationary bike.
Adjust the seat to the proper level before beginning.
Start by cycling at a low resistance for 20 to 30 minutes for the first few weeks.
Increase your resistance every week, as long as your body is comfortable with this increase and it does not produce prolonged muscle soreness.
Rotate your workouts.
Try to do programmed workouts of either endurance or intervals, if you have a computerized stationary bike.
Set weekly or monthly goals.

Attend every practice if possible.
Learn your choreography right away, and ask for help when you need it.
Practice your dances outside of designated practice times with a friend or two.
Learn your vocals and really project your voice.
Do not appear nervous or stiff onstage.
Read the lyrics of your songs out loud in front of a mirror to find meaning and have reacting facials that are appropriate.
Always use your facials.
Sign up for a show choir camp during the summer for a place to hone both your singing and dancing abilities.

Begin doing a few stretches primarily around the calf and shin muscles to prevent injury.Begin walking about a half mile to loosen up and get the blood pumping

,Gradually build up your speed until you enter a jog which is about the same speed as a brisk walk(or whichever comfort speed you prefer)

,Maintain a speed which you can sing a song without running out of breath

,
At first it will feel like your muscles will give out, but keep pushing.
Grab any music playing device!,
Get a pedometer.
If you are in pain, slow down to a walk and let your muscles rest for about 5 minutes, but no longer than 10 and then continue to trot again.
Never give up!

Find where you want the phone jack.
Decide your endpoint.
Decide on wire placement.
Decide what type of box you want.
Get your parts.
Now that you have your parts, go ahead and install the wire.
Start the Wiring.
Repeat at the other end of the wire, connecting to the appropriate two terminals on the inside terminal or demarcation point.
Test your new jack, which should now be working.
If your other phones are still working (all of them for a home run, or the one at the jack you tapped from), check your new jack's wiring.
Get a multimeter and test the wire.
If all else fails, check the wire itself - you want to check for continuity between at least the pair of wires you're using, and the same colors on the opposite end.

If you give up, call your phone company or an electrician.

Use colloquial sayings.
Reduce your use of the verb “to be.” This means not using the words “is,” “are,” and “am” as much.
Relearn the word “done.” In southern speech, “done” can have a few different meanings.
Incorporate “might could” and “y’all” into your speech.
Remember that many Southerners are polite.

Get a new or used trash can.
After you have rinsed and cleaned the bin with warm water and a soft brush, drill a few holes in the bottom to release excess moisture.
Start by laying down a nice thick bed of wet straw, shredded paper, cured grass clippings, clay and silt, not too rich in sand though, but you can use potting soils that do not have chemicals added.
Choose a place for your bin that is partially shaded, so it will not over heat in the hot summer sun, and kill your worms.
Layer the materials, and do not stir or mix them.
Once you are about three quarters to the top, add your worms.
Once the worms are added, and they have gone into the top of the materials, water generously from the top with rainwater, or non chlorinated water.
Check on the compost bin from time to time, and if some materials have decayed enough, it may be wise to remove some of it, and replace it with new layers of organic materials.

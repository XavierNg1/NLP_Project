Wash and prepare your tomatoes.
Put your tomatoes on a plate.
Place another plate on top of the first plate.
Place your hand over the top plate to steady the tomatoes.
Move your knife into place so it fits into gap between the plates.
Slice all the way through the plate to the other side.
Remove your plate and inspect the tomatoes to ensure they have all been cut in half.

Remember that he is your friend.
Make him see the value of your friendship: Talk about your boyfriend, commiserate with him over your life dramas, make it clear that you are absolutely comfortable with him because, to you, he is sexless.
Let him see the negative side of you: You might be prone to gossiping, hate children, really messy or you swear way too much.
Decline invitations to go out to dinner or anything resembling a date with just the two of you.
Meeting for coffee after class or work is fine, but don't do it too often.
Lead by example: Be a good friend to him, but don't go too far.
If he started this whole mess by declaring his feelings, be kind, but firm.

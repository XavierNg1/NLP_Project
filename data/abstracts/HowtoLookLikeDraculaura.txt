Dye your hair black.
Put streaks in your hair.
Cut straight-across bangs.
Wear low pigtails.
Make your face sweetly vampirish.
Don't forget the fangs.
Wear black and pink.
Wear a tutu.
Go for vintage goth style.
Wear tall lace-up boots.
Get a black and pink umbrella.
Wear classy jewelry.
Practice your Transylvanian accent.
Be smiley and friendly.
Have a cute pet bat.

Let your friend know you're there and that you're going to help them.
Talk to your friend often.
When they talk, listen to them and reply with a calm and attached voice if prompted.
Avoid saying nasty things about your shy friend's personality.
Go out with them often.
Start a social media profile for your friend (if permitted), as this would introduce them to a wider range of socialization and make the work of helping them beat their shyness easier for you.

Encourage your friend to take pictures of themselves, and take group pictures with them also.

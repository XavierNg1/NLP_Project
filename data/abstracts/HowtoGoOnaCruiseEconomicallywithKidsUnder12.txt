Take along lanyards for security.
Use plastic compression bags (the ones you squeeze or vacuum the air out of) for packing.
Include a pop-up laundry basket.
Don't forget an extension cord/power strip.
Pack plenty of wide mouth water bottles.
Add an alarm clock.
Take spray sunscreen, an SPF 45 face cream, bug spray (depending on where you go) a little thing of hand sanitizer, and if you are really crazy like me, a small bottle of anti-bacterial dish soap (for the water bottles) which doubles as hand soap in the bathroom.
Bring a portable DVD player.
Include a set of walkie-talkies; they are great and help you communicate.
Make sure everyone brings a good attitude!

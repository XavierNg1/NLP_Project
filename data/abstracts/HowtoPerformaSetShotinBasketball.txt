Shooting Hand/Arm Positioning: Hold the ball in your shooting hand.
Off-Hand Positioning: Place your off-hand on the side of the ball; the thumb of that hand pointed toward the centre of your forehead.
Performing the Set-Shot: Extend your arm with force, and when it is fully extended, flick your wrist to create backspin.

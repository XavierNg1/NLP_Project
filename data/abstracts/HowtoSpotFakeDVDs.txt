Research the movie that you want to buy.
Look carefully at the cover.
Examine the actual DVD if you have already bought it.
Put the DVD into your DVD drive.
If the spine of the DVD is very thin, and the case is opaque, it is probably fake.

,
If random messages show up about how bootlegs are illegal, or the colors are distorted, these are messages that the average camera can pick up.

,
Look for copy protection.
Go back to the manufacturer or store that sold you the DVD.
Complain to the seller.

Select the material you want your hook to be in.
Decide on the length of the crochet hook.

Decide which way you want the hook portion to point in relation to the handle, if you are using material that is not cylindrical (a rectangular chopstick or a rough branch).

Cut the material to the final length, or a bit longer.

Put a rough point on the end that will become the hook.

Carve a neck onto the hook.

Sand the neck so that it is reasonably smooth and even.

Do a little rough sanding on the end at this stage to round out the tip.

Mark a "smile" where the initial cut for the hook will go.


Make a 45 degree cut about halfway through the dowel, at the mark.

Widen this cut and make it deeper by whittling with a knife.

Work the sides of the "smile" higher.

Shape the point and shorten it as required.
Sand the hook thoroughly, especially the hook and the part of the neck that will come into contact with the yarn or thread.

Use the hook.

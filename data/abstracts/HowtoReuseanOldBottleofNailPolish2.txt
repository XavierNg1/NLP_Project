Tip the bottle over to empty out any nail polish that will come out on its own.
Add a few drops of nail polish thinner or paint thinner in the bottle if there are dried-up remnants of nail polish.
Add some acetone to finish cleaning out all polish residue.
Allow to dry fully.
Allow to dry fully again.
If you need the brush, it will get cleaned as you clean the bottle but may need additional cleaning upon closer inspection, so always check.

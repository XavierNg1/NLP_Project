Preparation for a game starts not on the day of the game, but during the practices during the week before.
Arrive at the rink at least an hour before going out on the ice.
When itâ€™s time to get on the ice put on your helmet and gloves and grab your stick.
When you get on the ice, use the shots during the warm up to prepare yourself.

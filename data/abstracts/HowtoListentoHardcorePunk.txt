Work your way into hardcore.
Start with classic hardcore.
Keep up with the contemporary scene.
Dig deeper.
Learn about the history of hardcore punk.
Listen to the tight precision of the songs.
Read the lyrics.
Move with it.
Take out your earbuds.
Understand what hardcore is not.
Go see hardcore live.
Learn about straight edge.
Dress how you want.
Be yourself.

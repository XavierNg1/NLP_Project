Buy a camera, a good one!,
Get to know your camera The best way to learn is to be nosey, this is the same approach you should apply to your camera when using it.
Introduce your camera to subjects and surroundings This is the best way to practice using the camera.
Compose a photography plan Come up with and develop some strategies for a narrative; organise your shoot with a timeline and a shot list with possible shots you may need for a story that you are assigned to.
On the job: Before taking photos of someone, ask!,
Build a rapport with your subject Once things are established and you have received permission from your subject to have their photo taken, find some common ground and engage in background research OR conversation.
Choose the photos that sell a story Some of the greatest shots in the media are simply an occurrence of luck more than anything.
Rework, Refine, Retouch Getting it right the first time is the key to groundbreaking photography, so the less editing required for your images the better!

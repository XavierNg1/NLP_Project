Determine if the bird is a nestling or a fledgling.
Note if the baby bird’s parents and/or nest is nearby.
Check if the bird is injured or appears ill. Look for signs of injury on the bird, like a broken limb, bleeding on the bird’s body, and missing patches of feathers (if the bird is a fledgling).
Avoid interacting with a fledgling if it is not injured and it is close to its nest.
Wear gloves when handling the bird.
Make a hanging nest if the bird’s parents are nearby but the nest is destroyed.
Create a nest from a small plastic bowl and paper towel if the bird is orphaned.
Place the bird in the nest and cover it with a paper towel.
Put the nest in a warm, quiet, and dark area.
Do not feed the baby bird.
Wash your hands after handling the bird.
Contact your local wildlife center.
Describe the condition of the baby bird.
Transport the baby bird to the care of the rehabilitator.

Understand that someone infected with the rabies virus will begin to show signs of the disease within 1-3 months.
Be aware that once the clinical symptoms of the rabies infection appear, survival is unlikely.
Contact a doctor immediately if you have been bitten by a wild animal or any animal that may not have been vaccinated against the virus.

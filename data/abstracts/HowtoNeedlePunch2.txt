Hold the needle like you would a pencil with the bevel side facing the direction you are punching.
Punch the pattern.
Move the needle head over a few stitches to make the next punch.
Repeat this punching process until the pattern is complete.
Complete the stitching by slowly pulling the needle out of the fabric.
Pull apart the embroidery hoop to remove the completed pattern.

Stand on the board.
Adjust your feet with your front foot near the middle of the board and your back foot on the tail of the board.
Bend your knees and crouch down.
Jump into the air, first with your front foot, and after with your back foot.
Jump up, and kick down the back of your board at the same time.
Slide your front foot as soon as you start jumping.
Pull your knees up towards your chest.
Level out with both when your front foot has slid all the way up, keeping pressure on the board as it begins to fall down.
Try to land both feet at the same time, preferably with your feet as close to their respective trucks as possible.

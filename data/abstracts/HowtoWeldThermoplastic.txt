Prepare plastic components.
Ensure that all soils are removed.
Use a face mask when performing this task as this process can create a fair bit of dust.Once the part has been properly cleaned are prepared, we are now ready for the "Tacking" step.
Apply a "V" groove to the weld area:

Weld plastics components relies on a number of factors -
Surface Preparation
Good joint interfaces
Plastics Identification / Correct welding rod selection
"V" Grooving, using the rotary burr
Tacking
Correct welding temperatures
Welding technique

,
A Rotary Burr is used to provide a "V" groove along the weld line.
Tack plastics:

Tacking of plastics components prior to welding, helps the welder to achieve two things -

Good joint interfaces and
Alignment of the plastic components prior to main welding


The "Tacking Nozzle" can be used to ensure close joint interfaces and alignment of broken parts.
Fit the standard nozzle (LE100303) on the welding tool.
Once up to temperature (from cold, this takes approx.
Do it all at once.
Finish it.
Use the "Speed Welding" technique for long weld runs.
Fit the standard nozzle on the welding tool.
The Speed Welding nozzles are an easy push fit onto the standard nozzle.

Use Jacketed hollow-point (JHP) bullets for self defense.
Test out solid FMJ (Full Metal Jacket) bullets for better target penetration.
Consider the weight of the bullet.
Know that powder loads can change a bullet's ballistics and the gun's feel.
Avoid shooting with the ammunition you intend to use for self-defense, as it can get expensive.

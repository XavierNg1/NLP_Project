About a month before the beginning of the new school year, make a genuine effort to return to your school routine.
Do not come to school unprepared.
Buy a good backpack.
Invest in some new clothes for the school year.
Dress however you like.
It's the night before school begins.
It's time to get ready for school.
As you arrive at school, remember to smile.
When the bell rings, signaling you to report to class, be in your assigned seat ready to learn by the time the late bell rings.
Always behave in your classes.
Surround yourself with a positive group of people.
Shy away from serious love relationships at this point in your life.
Always complete assignments on time.
Study, study, study.
Keep a positive outlook on things.
Before you know it, the year will fly by.

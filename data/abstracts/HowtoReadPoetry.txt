Understand the usage of lines, stanzas (basically paragraphs for poems), and punctuation.
Understand that poets use of words is more restricted than the casual writer.
Know that just because a line might end, doesn't mean that the sentence did, and that you should pause.
Look at the sentences.
Look again how you read it.This time, you probably paused at 'Ida,' and made 'lovelier' flow together with 'than' without pause.
Go back and read the poem with the correct pauses, keeping in mind the feeling of reading it like a paragraph.
Don't be afraid to look up the words you don't know.

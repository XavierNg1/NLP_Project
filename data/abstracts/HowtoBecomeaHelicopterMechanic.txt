Becoming a helicopter mechanic is the same process as becoming a fixed wing aircraft mechanic.
To get the A&P license, one must either attend an aviation mechanic school or have 30 months of hands on experience working on aircraft.
Once the 30 months experience requirement is met or one has attended an aviation mechanic school, it is then possible to test for the A&P license.
After acquiring the A&P license, one can now apply for helicopter mechanic positions.

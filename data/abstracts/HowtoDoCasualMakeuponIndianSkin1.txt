Consider a moisturizing makeup prep & primer.
Begin by concealing dark circles around the eyes and any scars, spots or marks on the face.
Choose a light foundation or compact powder matching your skin tone, if wearing one.
Do contouring and highlighting as necessary.
Use a dark colored eyeliner to make your eyes pop dramatically.
Use neutral-colored eye shadow, or none at all, for a casual look.
Groom the eyebrows to shape your face and eyes.
Apply a good mascara, working up from the base of the lashes for the best results.
Keep the blush light and rosy, only adding a little along your cheek bones for a pinkish glow.
Use a nice, rosy lip gloss or stick to complete the casual, killer look.

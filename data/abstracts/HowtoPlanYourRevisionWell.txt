Stick to this timetable!,
Begin by revising all the material which you don't know as well.
Actually attempt to remember the material.
Read the facts a few times so you are familiar with what they mean.
After you are more familiar with them, make your own notes so that it's shorter, but ensure that they make sense so you won't need to refer back to the test book when revising.

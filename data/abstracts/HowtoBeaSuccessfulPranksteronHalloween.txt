Check the shrubs for fun-crushers with hoses and scary costumes with Airsoft or paintball guns, before entering the yard to do your dastardly deeds.
Go pranking with group of friends that you know won't rat you out or chicken out at the end.
Use your costume mask or a t-shirt balaclava to hide your identity from people, especially if you are using pranks that interact with people.
Stay classy.
Stick to the classics.
Be creative.
Have fun!

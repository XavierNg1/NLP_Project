Figure out what is going to change about your role now that you are a manager.
Prepare for the transition: This will become confusing and frustrating... perhaps not immediately, but managers are often pulled in multiple directions.
Identify your goals: What, specifically, are your measured goals?,
Know your team: You need to know individual strengths and weaknesses for each team member.
Match tasks with staff: Use the information you gleaned from the above steps to match people with work.
Meet with your team members: Regular one-on-one meetings are critical to good management.
Be visible: You must not isolate yourself from the team.
Document team activities: Your personal performance review will focus largely on your team’s performance so make sure you keep a written record of issues and accomplishments.
Reward performance: This doesn’t mean money… although money is nice, it’s not a primary motivator for on-the-job performance.
Learn coaching: There will inevitably be times when you need to correct behavior.

Turn the furnace off before starting any work on the fuel pump.
Locate the bleed screw on the fuel pump near where the fuel line comes in.
Place a small bucket or pan under the bleed screw.
Use a small crescent wrench or pliers to slightly loosen the bleed screw.
Push the reset button on the furnace to turn it back on.
Tighten the screw as soon as the air stops sputtering out and a steady stream of fuel pours out.
Let the furnace continue to run.

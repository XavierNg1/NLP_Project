Educate yourself.
Be sure to shop for a congregation that fits you in terms of your skills and temperament.
Once you are a pastor, get to know everyone in the congregation personally.
Once you are established, be sure to balance your time.
For emergencies, use a special cell phone.
Be sure to take good care of your physical, spiritual and mental health.
Be certain to take time out to become more knowledgeable about being a pastor.
How you dress, where you live, and the car you drive will depend upon a balance of what is comfortable for you and your congregation.
It's difficult to know beforehand what your parishioners will need from you.
Whatever you do, work to create lay leadership that can help you develop worship and other activities for the congregation.
How you are compensated is up to you.
Pray.

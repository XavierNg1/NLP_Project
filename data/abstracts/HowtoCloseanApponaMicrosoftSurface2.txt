Open any app, so that you see a screen.
Swipe in another of the apps you have open (or the app you'd like to close) but don't release the app, making sure the complete preview of the app shows up on the screen.
Drag the app off the dock of open apps until it's completely off and not touching the dock at all, then drag it downward until it's off the screen.

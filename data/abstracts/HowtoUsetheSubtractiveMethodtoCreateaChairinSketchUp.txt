Start up SketchUp and select the icon for creating a rectangular shape.
Select the Push/Pull icon and then 'pull' it up somewhat.
Click on the line tool icon and draw 2 straight lines perpendicular to each other.
After you have completed that, hover over the end point indicated here, using the rectangle tool, hover over the indicated endpoint here.
Continuing down from the endpoint, go to the bottom of the shape and create a rectangle.
Check it out to see if you are doing all right.
Use the rectangle tool and the push/pull tool, create the legs.
With the push/pull tool still selected, first get one leg to look the way you want.
Create a nice arched back to your chair.

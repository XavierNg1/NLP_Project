Find a villager that trades for a mass-producible resource like paper, written books, or wheat.

,
Trap the villager in a well-lit hole or house.
Plant/breed the resources and harvest them later (or harvest them from a preexisting farm).
Open up the place where you trapped the villager and trade the resources you obtained.
If the village has a large population and/or is well defended, kill that villager.
Kill a fourth of the villagers, if there is a high population and they are well defended.

Don't ever give too much away.
Practice being quiet, in all different kinds of situations, hard and easy.
Stealth isn't being good at hide and seek.
Be creative in your sneaking, use concealment to cover from the line of sight of other people, use camouflage to blend in with your surroundings so you can lie in plain sight and not be spotted and lastly use your senses.Learn to creep, this is when you crawl use your feet and hands, but keep your body off the ground

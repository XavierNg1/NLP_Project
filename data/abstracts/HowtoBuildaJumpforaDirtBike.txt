Decide how much you want to spend on it.
Decide how big you want it.
Decide on the materials.
Find a good, open location.
Get the right materials and tools for the ramp.
Decide what kind of jump you want to make:


a 'double' (one jump and one catch),
a 'Step-up' (The landing is higher than the take-off),
an 'Step-down' (The landing is lower than the take-off),
a 'kicker' (just a good ol' dirt jump),
a 'spine' (a jump on one side and the catch is the the other side),
a 'table top' (two jumps with a bridge in the middle to land on or do tricks on).
Decide how large the jump 'gap' will be, if you want one.

,
Start digging a hole for your jump, or if there are a lot of rocks just take the top layers, or use a wheelbarrow to haul some dirt from somewhere else.
Pile dirt where you want the jump.
Shape the piles of dirt into the jumps.
The catch ramp can either be slightly concave or be flat.
Take a few runs at it and adjust the ramp.

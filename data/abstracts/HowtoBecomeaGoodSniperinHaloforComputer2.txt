Don't stand in one spot!,
Crouch down whenever your in defense of your moves.
Avoid unnecessary jumping as the parabolic motion is easily predictable to experienced snipers and you cannot change direction in mid-air.
Find a location where it is hard for people to sneak up on you (against a wall for instance).
Know thy enemy.

Fill a saucepan with 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water, and bring it to a boil.
Add 2 to 4 teaspoons (10 to 20 grams) of sugar and stir until dissolved.
Remove the saucepan from heat, and the mixture cool before adding 8 drops of your favorite essential oil.
Carefully pour the mixture into a spray bottle.
Close the spray bottle, and shake it before using it.

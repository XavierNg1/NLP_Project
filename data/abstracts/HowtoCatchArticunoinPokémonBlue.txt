Know that Articuno is in the Seafoam Islands east of Cinnabar Island and south-west of Fuchsia City.
Find the entrance to the Seafoam Islands.
Enter any one of the holes that are formed when you block the current.
Save your game after you reach Articuno.
Make sure you have the right supplies.
Hit the Pok√©mon with heavy attacks first, to make it weak.
If you are lucky it will be quick; otherwise, keep trying.

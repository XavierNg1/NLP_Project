Stir in the lime juice, garlic and mustard using a fork or a small whisk.
Pour 1 cup (240 milliliters) of the glaze into a separate container.
Get out your 1-gallon (3.75 liter) plastic resealable freezer bag.
Refrigerate the salmon, marinating it for 20 minutes.
Remove the salmon from the resealable bag and discard the marinade.
Bake the salmon 10 minutes for every inch of thickness, basting every 5.

If you are just beginning 300 meter hurdling, you might be familiar with 55 meter or 100 meter hurdling.
Attack every hurdle and stay low, keep an even distance between the hurdle and your body the whole race when going over.
Do not pull your lead leg around the hurdle, that will just slow you down.Run full speed at the end and push yourself even more

,
If you knock a hurdle down don't hesitate.

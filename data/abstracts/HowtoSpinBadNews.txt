Research the event: You need to know, to the last detail, what happened.
Create a timeline: This is not just for the past but for the future too.
Create alternate event descriptions: This is where you will build the "spin" for the public.
Roleplay and improve: To do this properly, it takes a group of people dedicated to the result.
Prepare your audience: You're not going to just jump in and make your presentation.
Pause: Don't release your information immediately following the leaks.
Go Public: Release your information.

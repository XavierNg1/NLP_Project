Draw a circle and two perpendicular diameter lines.
Make a slightly larger circle centered on the same point as the original.
Make an arc across the center of the circle.
Repeat for the opposite side.
Draw two lines that pass through the corners of the eye.
Draw two arcs from the remaining points of intersection between the inner circle and its diameter lines.
Using a straightedge draw lines through the corners of the new eye.
Connect the corners of the "square" just completed to the intersection of the central cross and the inner circle.
Erase the circle, lines, and arcs, leaving the octagon alone.

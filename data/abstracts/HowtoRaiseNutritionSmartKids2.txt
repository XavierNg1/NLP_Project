Avoid calling food a “treat” or “reward.” As you raise your children, don’t refer to certain foods as “treats” or “rewards.” This gives the food more power than it should have and makes it seem like something special or desirable.
Model healthy eating choices.
Remove distractions from mealtimes.
Discourage mindless snacking.

Make an indoor running program based on your outdoor program.
Record your running in a log and include a blank calender that you can mark on.
Determine what your goals are and plan your sessions accordingly.
Choose a soft surface to run on.
Do running in place as your basic exercise.
To develop your backwards motion, do continuous forward and backward running.
Incorporate some sidewards movements by doing side, ladder drills.
Do first steps.
Do forward running only by: running forward, stopping, turning, running back to where you started, and repeat this over and over.
If you have a large space to use, run laps.

Look at the obvious.
Talk to him.
Text him.
Become friends with his friends, guys like having a girlfriend that's comfortable being with him and his friends.
Become friends with him, but don't become too close or it could ruin your chance with him.
Does he want you to help him with projects or always pick you as his partner in school?,
Does he always give you hugs?,
Does he always smile when he looks at you, or shows interest?

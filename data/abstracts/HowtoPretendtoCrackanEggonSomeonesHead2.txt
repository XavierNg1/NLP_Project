Prepare for the trick by running your hands under cold water.
Ask the friend you plan to prank to sit or stand with his back to you.
Ask your friend if he's ever had an egg cracked on his head.
Place your "egg" hand lightly on top of your friend's head.
Hit your egg hand with your free hand to simulate cracking the egg.
Drag both hands down the sides of your friend's head like the insides of an egg.

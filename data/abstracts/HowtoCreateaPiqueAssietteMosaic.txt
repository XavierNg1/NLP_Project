Assemble your materials in a comfortable, well-lit work area;
,
Break your pottery with hammer and/or nippers.
Use a new terra cotta pot.
Use a good non-oil based primer to seal the terra cotta both inside and out.
Mix a small portion of polymer modified thinset mortar (not the speed setting kind as this will set too quickly).
Using a plastic knife or palette knife, spread the mortar over a small area of your pot.
Place your crockery shards in a pleasing pattern.
Apply grout to cracks between crockery shards after the mortar has cured completely.
Use a dry rag (lint free) or very slightly damp tile sponge (not a kitchen sponge) to gently clean off the grout from the tiles without pulling it out of the cracks.

,
Apply grout sealant after the grout has dried if you are concerned about staining.

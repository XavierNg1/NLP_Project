Knowing how to dress is key.
Write down a list of words you want to describe your look or vibe.
Mix 'n' Match.
Look in your closet, and donate anything you never used and will never use.

,
Buy accessories that mix well with what you have.

,
Get a few new shoes and sandals at a reasonably-priced store, like Payless (it's fashionable, and no one has to know).
Wear make-up!,
Do your hair.
Make sure to compliment other stylish people, they will start noticing what you wear, and you will be more noticed.
Here are some outfit suggestions.

Look for a faucet/tap on the pipe that leads to your toilet cistern/tank.

If you have an older system (pre-1970s) your toilet may not have a shut-off valve.
Try slipping a narrow length of wood under the lift arm/float lever (3) and straddling the board across the tank (front to back) to hold the lever up.
Flush the toilet to empty it.
After the completion of your repair work, simply remove the board and or strapping to allow the float to refill the tank.

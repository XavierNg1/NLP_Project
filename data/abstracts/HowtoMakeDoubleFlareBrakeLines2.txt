Cut the tubing to the required length with your tubing cutter.
Chamfer the ends of the tubes that you'll be double-flaring.
Slide the fitting onto the line, with the threading facing the side you just cut.
Mount your flaring base in a vice.
Slide the tube into the appropriate sized hole on the flaring base so that the chamfered end barely pokes out the top.
Tighten the flaring base around the tube, starting with the screws closest to your brake tube.
File down the top of the tube so that it is flush with the flaring tool.
Use a reaming tool to clean out the inside edge.

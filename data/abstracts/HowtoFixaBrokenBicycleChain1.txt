Take a picture, draw out, or memorize how the chain is currently attached.
Shift the bike into the middle gears in both the front and back, noting which gears you're on.
Remove the broken chain and clean it with a degreaser and water.
Use a chainbreak tool to carefully push the pin halfway out of the broken link.
Pull the broken link off the pin and discard.
Thread the chain back onto the bike the way it came off.
Fit the two end of the chain into one another so the holes line up.
Use your chainbreak tool in reverse to push the pin through, completing the link.
Grab the chain on each side of your newly connected links and move it from side to side to loosen up the new connection.
Lubricate your chain with bike grease.
Avoid using your biggest gear in the back gears, as the chain is now a link too short.

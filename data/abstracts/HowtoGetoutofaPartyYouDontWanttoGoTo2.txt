Don’t be too hard on yourself for lying.
Keep your lie simple.Lie as little as possible, without elaboration.
Blame your family.
Say you already have plans.
Pretend you’re not feeling well.
Pretend you have too much work to do.
Set up your lie ahead of time.If the party is two weeks away, and you know the whole time that you don’t want to attend the party, don’t wait until the last second to get out of it!,
Keep track of your lie.

Start by acquiring different pieces of different styles.
Even though it's hard, pick ONE fashion style that you like the best and use that as your main style.
Incorporate other parts of other fashions into your outfits.
Go shopping with friends so they can help you decide what looks best on you.
Change things slowly.
Keep your personality the same.

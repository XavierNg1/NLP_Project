Allow your reed to soak in warm water for at least 3 minutes in a cup.
Before the reed is inserted into the instrument, blow into it for a few seconds to get the spit/water out, make sure your lips are completely covering your teeth to prevent damage to the reed.
Place the reed in the center of your lower lip and roll your lip over your teeth so they are just covered.
If this is your first time playing the oboe, there is an exercise you can do to get used to the reed.
Continue by inserting the reed into the upper joint.
Get into a good position to play, as good posture is important for a good sound.
Place your left hand on the upper joint.
When you're done playing, you will have some water condensed from your breath left in your instrument.
And remember, the oboe isn't for everyone.

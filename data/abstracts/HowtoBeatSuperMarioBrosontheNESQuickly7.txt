As you climb the first rock tower, you will see two Koopa Troopas and a Lakitu.
Once you reach the section of the level littered with cannons, the only way to continue at full speed is to stay above every cannon.
After the cannons you will be required to jump four tubes with piranha plants sticking out.
The final tricky part of this level occurs after this jump.The few enemies after this point can be ignored as they do not cross your path of movement.Run up the block wall and grab the flag to end this level.

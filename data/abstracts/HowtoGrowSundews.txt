Research the sundew plant.
Know how the sundews catch their food.
Obtain your plants.
Add long-fibered sphagnum moss, peat moss, or a mixture of either peat and sand or peat and perlite to a 4 inch/10cm pot.
Spread the seeds on the surface of the potting medium.
Wait for the sundew to grow taller and wider with more stems.
Keep the sundew at a temperature of 45-90ÂºF/7-32C or sub-tropical conditions.
Feed the plant once every two weeks.
During summer or late spring, five-petaled flowers will start to bloom.
Water the plant.
If you have chosen to grow the plant in a terrarium (even though the plant will grow better outside), remember that you have to feed it.
If you put the sundew outside, remember to check it every day to see if the plant has been attacked.

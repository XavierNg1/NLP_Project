Hold the lighter vertically in your hand.
Be judicious with the flame.
Do not allow your lighter to burn continuously for more than two minutes.
Consider adjusting the gas flow.
Be aware that butane lighters do not work well above 10,000 feet.
Consider removing the safety band from a Bic lighter to make it easier to light.

Learn basics about Christ as your first step to "health.",
Immerse yourselves in Christ, receive the free salvation of the Lord, and your life will change for the better.

Imitate Christ's ways.
Be un-troubled when times bother you.
Accept that we need Him and each other.

Give not 50%/50% like the old saying goes but 100%/100% to each other and we will never want anything because in giving we are receiving.

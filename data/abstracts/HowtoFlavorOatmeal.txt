Make the oatmeal, first, as you normally would.
Take one small banana, or half of a large one, and cut it up into small slices horizontally.
Add seven to ten walnuts or other nuts of your choice onto the oatmeal.
Carefully wash and dice one to two medium-sized strawberries.
Wash a handful of blueberries (five to seven).
Add raisins and/or Craisins.
Try spices such as cinnamon or ginger.
If you're feeling indulgent, don't be afraid to add syrup, sugar or chocolate.
Take a small spoon and mix the oatmeal with the contents you have just added.
Using unflavoured original oatmeal measure approx.
Slice 1 whole banana on to the oatmeal and drizzle with honey and hey presto a quick and easy way of making oatmeal!

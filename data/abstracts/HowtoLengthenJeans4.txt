Gather your supplies.
Cut off the bottom hem of your pant leg.
Determine the measurements for your fabric band.
Cut the fabric according to your measurements.
Fold the rectangle in half and sew the two short sides together.
Fold the top edge down towards the bottom edge so that you end up with an even shorter tube.
Flip the pant leg inside out and slip the cuff inside it.
Sew the two together using a Â½ inch (1.27) seam allowance.
Gently tug the cuff out from inside the pant leg and iron the seam.
Topstitch the hem down using a thread color that matches your jean fabric.
Repeat the entire process for the other pant leg.
Done.

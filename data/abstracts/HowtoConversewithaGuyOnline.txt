Be more informal and casual in your conversation.
Never gloom.
Show him who you really are.
Avoid asking him short-answer questions.
Talk about anything; his favorite band, color.
Know how to end the conversation.
Be careful about talking to him too often.
Only ask a guy out online as a last resort only.
Finished.

To begin improving others' lives, you must first look at yourself from another person's point of view.
Now that you see yourself clearly, it is time to help others.
Is someone sitting by themselves at lunch?,
If you have a locker, or even just a desk, write a note to someone that seems sad lately.
Join a club or group that helps the community.
Just be ready.

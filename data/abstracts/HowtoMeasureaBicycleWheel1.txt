Stand the bike upright by leaning it against a wall or using the kick stand.
Measure the distance in inches from the ground beneath the tire to the center point of the wheel.
Measure the flat part of the tire across the tread from one side to the other.
Remember when purchasing a new tire that traditional, or standard sizes place the diameter first, followed by the width.

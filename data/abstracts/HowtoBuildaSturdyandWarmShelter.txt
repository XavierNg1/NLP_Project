Dig a pit a little taller as you are wide.

Find two sticks (preferably 2" in diameter) that have a fork at the top and have lots of branches.

Find a stick (2" in diameter) and place it across the forks.
,

Find as many sticks as you can and place them on the stick that's across the two forked sticks.

Place sticks going down the side.

If you can, place pine needles, small twigs, other dry tree and plant materials etc.

Insulate your walls and roof.

Place mud on all the sections where sticks meet.

Make a door.

If you want, you can find two more forked sticks and plant them in the ground 2 feet (0.6Â m) away from your shelter.

Alternatively, find two trees about as far apart as your own height, plus a foot, and a branch that can reach between them.

Lash two of your uprights together at one end, then repeat with the other two and lean these against both of the trees in an inverted V shape, digging in the ends.
,

Place the longest remaining long branch between the two V's, resting on the top.

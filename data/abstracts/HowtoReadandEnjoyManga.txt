Research what manga is all about.
Keep this in mind whilst thinking about reading and collecting manga: you need to understand that there are a LOT of genres, from action to adventure, sports/games to comedy, puppy love (young romance) to sensual romance, yaoi (manga and anime focusing on gay relationships) to yuri (manga and anime focusing on lesbian relationships), horror to mystery, and historical dramas to school life!,
If you are currently earning money, go out and buy manga if you enjoy it (and after your other responsibilities are paid for).
Read manga series and volumes in order; otherwise you will get confused as to where the plot is going!

Read it properly.

Before you begin, do you own Super Smash Bros Melee?,
The first thing you need to do is download the Dolphin emulator.
Create a new folder (name it something you can remember).
Double-click the Dolphin file and click the "..." button.
Go to the folder you made in step 3, and double click the file named "Dolphin".
Assuming it opened up a program, you can close it.

,
Now you need to download the Super Smash Bros Melee ISO.
Now navigate to the folder you downloaded.

,
Right click the file called "sc-sbbm.001" and click "Rename".
Do the same thing for all the files labeled "sc-sbbm.002" all the way through "sc-sbbm.022".
Now double click the first file.
Once you're done extracting it, navigate back to Dolphin and re-launch the program.
Once it's loaded, double click the "Super Smash Bros Melee" logo.

It may take a few minutes, but there you go!

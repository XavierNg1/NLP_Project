Check the adjustment of your brake cables.
Lubricate the cables.
Remove the cable from its casing, only if it is very stiff, or difficult to operate.
Thread the loose end of the cable through the clamp at the end you removed previously, and check the "free travel" (the distance the brake lever can be squeezed before the brake contacts the wheel).
Replace either the cable, or the complete cable assembly if the steps above did not solve the problem of the cable not moving when the brakes are applied.

Always start simple.
If mom is really reluctant to stray from her old favourites, try to find out why.
Try to address her fears by doing some shopping on your own.
If it's a time constraint that keeps mom at the same old stores, see if you can find two or three good new shops in advance, and have a few items picked out so she can see what they offer.

Be honest about the styles.
If you're too young to go to the mall alone for advance shopping, log on to a shopping portal site like Catalogs.com and browse the online catalogs.
Above all, stay calm and mature.

Know what type of boy he is.
Find out the boy's name and write "Dear (insert name)" at the top of the page.
Talk about what you like about him and a little about yourself.
Try to use good spelling and grammar.
Sign it "Love, (insert your name here)".
Try putting a picture of yourself in the card.
Put it in something noticeable like a purple envelope, or something more discreet if you think he'll find it embarrassing, and have a friend give it to him or put it in his locker.
If you're the confident type, find him, walk straight up to him and hand it to him with a smile.

Add one full container of fuel efficiency booster (such as STP Fuel Boost or the like which you can purchase at any superstore supermarket carrying automotive supplies).
Change the air filter every 20,000 milesthough city-driven Sentras will need closer an air filter change about every 15,000 miles.
Change the car's engine oil every 7,500 miles.
Run through a checklist removing unnecessary items from the car at the very least by the summer months, if you can get away with it.
Don't overfill and top-off the fuel tank upon fueling the Sentra.
Don't let the Sentra vehicle run below a quarter tank of gas.
Make sure your tires are properly inflated to their proper pressure.
Try your hardest to not use your air conditioner in city traffic.
Use cruise control (if your Sentra is equipped with it, as on some older models this was still an optional feature (though most people tend to think it's standard on all Sentras)).
Avoid city streets unless there is no way of avoiding them.
Ease yourself on the gas pedal.
Don't try not to idle your Sentra.

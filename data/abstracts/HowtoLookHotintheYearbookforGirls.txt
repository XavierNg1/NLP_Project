The night before picture day, go to bed early in order to ensure that you get enough of your beauty sleep.
In the morning, wake up right away when the alarm clock sounds so that you'll have plenty of time to get ready.
Go light on the makeup.
Practice smiling in the mirror to find out which type of smile looks best on you.
Choose an outfit that you'll appear cute and nice in, but also make sure that you're comfortable.
Wearing the right pair of shoes is also important.
The finishing touch are the accessories!,
When you and your class are preparing to take the class picture, it's suggested that you try extending your face slightly out from your neck, but not too much or it'll look awkward.
Before the photographer takes the photo, think of a good memory or something funny that will make you smile naturally.
If you think it does not look good try again!

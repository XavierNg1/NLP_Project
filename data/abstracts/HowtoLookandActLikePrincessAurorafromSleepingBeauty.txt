Let your hair be beautiful.
Be natural.
Dress trendy, with an ethereal, mystical twist.
Practice singing.
"She'll walk with Springtime wherever she goes.",
Believe in yourself.
Try to get a boyfriend.
Be kind and respecting to animals and nature.
Be curious!,
Be romantic all the time!,
Talk elegantly!

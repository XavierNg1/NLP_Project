Decide if you want a notebook or binder before the first week of class.
Throw away or recycle anything that youâ€™re not going to need in the next few weeks or newest unit.
Use your dividers to make a section for each of your classes.
Put a three-ring plastic envelope in your binder to carry other supplies such as pencils, flashcards, and CD's.
Keep your notebook organized by checking each section and throwing away unwanted papers at the end of the school day.

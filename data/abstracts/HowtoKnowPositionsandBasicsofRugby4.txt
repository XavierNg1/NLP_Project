The rules and regulations of rugby may be confusing.
The game begins when the “sir” (referee) blows the whistle.
Once the ball has been kicked and received by the offensive team, play will begin.
Unlike football, the ball can not be passed forwards; only backwards.

The backs do most of the ball handling, as they are the faster ones on the team.

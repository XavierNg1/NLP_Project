Read a lot of Chicken Soup for the Soul - they have so many good stories about kids and getting the right attitude.
Remember that it's ALL about your attitude!

,
Every time you feel sad, smile.
Spend time with little kids.
Really, you just need to MAKE yourself happy.
Think back on a time when you were a kid.
Don't be mean to kids.
If you are a kid, and yet you are reading this article, take a piece of paper and write "In 15 years I am going to be doing <--insert whatever you think you will be doing in 15 years-->".
Look at your childhood photos.
Live in the present.

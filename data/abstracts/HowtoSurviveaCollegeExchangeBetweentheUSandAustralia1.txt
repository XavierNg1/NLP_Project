Prepare for the journey.
Be prepared.
Look around.
Know that there will always be culture shock.
Enjoy: Now that you are at college in America, it is time to settle in to your new life.
Relish the new experience: If the opportunity to participate in a college exchange ever arises, do not let it pass.

Select between an acrylic, wooden, or polycarbonate call.
Consider volume.
Try making a call.
Hold the call properly.
Blow from your diaphragm.
Control the air with your throat and your mouth.
Put the call between your teeth.
Try learning old-time hand-calling technique.Much more difficult than calling with a good duck call, the hand technique is worthwhile to know in situations where your call might be broken or forgotten in the back of the truck.
Learn the quack.
Use a greeting call the first time you see ducks in the distance.
Try a feeding call.
Only use a hailing call when ducks are far away.
Use the appropriate call for the occasion.
Call sparingly.
Eliminate other distracting sounds while you're hunting.
Don't call if the ducks seem attracted to your decoys.
Be patient.
Practice.
Clean and tune your duck call after using it.Wooden duck calls especially will need drying out and wiping down after use, so the wood finish won't wear and crack.

This is a lengthy method that requires a lot of patience.
Place the horse in a stall/holding area well away from other horses and people.
After a few days, sit outside of the fenced area and read a book, while ignoring the horse.
Approach the horse slowly and offer a treat in a bucket.
Slowly attempt to stroke his head or neck area.
When he accepts you (without the treat) to touch him, enter the enclosure at the opposite end of where the horse is located.

,
Allow it to approach you.
Eventually, saddle and ride the horse again using the slow, gentle method.

Consider OpenOffice.org Writer, Microsoft Word, Abiword or Google Docs.
Start by determining how your document is structured.
Find the Styles Task Pane in your word processor.
Apply the appropriate style to each section and subsection heading, according to its importance or level of detail (as you analyzed in step 1 above).
Apply styles to the next level of detail in the outline: apply the style "Heading 2" to the second level of headings!,
Repeat as necessary, going down to the desired level of detail.
If you are including bullet points or numbered lists, do yourself and your coworkers a favor and avoid using the bullet/numbering buttons in the toolbars.

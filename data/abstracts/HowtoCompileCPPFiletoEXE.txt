First you need to get a C++ compiler.
Start a new project in Visual C++.
Copy and paste all of the .cpp files into the "Source Files" directory, and copy-paste all the .h files (if there are any) into the "Header Files" directory.
Build and compile.
Find the exe file.
Test it.
If you want the program to run on another computer as well, that computer must have VC++ Runtime libraries installed.

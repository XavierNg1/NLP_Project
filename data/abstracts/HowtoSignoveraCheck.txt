Consider your options.
Confirm that the person you want to endorse the check to, the third party, will accept a signed-over check.
Confirm that the third party's bank accepts such checks and know the bank's particular procedures.
Be prepared to go in person with the third party to his/her bank.
Sign the back of the check as usual, except keep your signature in the top section of the endorsement area.
Print "Pay to the Order of" and the third party's name in the middle section (or second line) of the endorsement area.
Do not have the third party sign the check until it is deposited or cashed.
Give the check to the endorsee to deposit in his/her bank as usual.
Open a bank account, deposit the check, then pay the third party.
Ask the original check writer to void the check and write a new one to the third party.
Ask the original check writer to add "or bearer" after your name on the check (and future checks written to you).
Use a check-cashing service.

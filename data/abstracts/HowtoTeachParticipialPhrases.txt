Explain that a participle is a form of a verb, usually ending in “ing” or “ed.” There are exceptions, but you can begin teaching using these endings to help the students identify them in the beginning.
Explain the use of this participle.
Use a more complicated example to show how a participle can be used with other words to form a participial phrase.
Explain that there are present participles, which describe something that is going on, and past participles that describe something in the past.
Introduce students to the use of verbs ending in “ed” as participles.
Ask the students why they would use participial phrases, instead of writing “Beth reads a lot of books about Mexico because she is interested in the ancient Mayans.” If they are struggling with the concept, explain how these phrases can be used to describe something in fewer words and to vary sentence structure.

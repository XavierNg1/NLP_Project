Place a cardboard box inside a larger cardboard box.
Line the inside of the smaller box with black construction paper, to absorb heat.
Cover each piece of cardboard with reflective material such as foil.
Attach each reflector to the top of one side of the box.
Prop each reflector up at around a 45 degree angle.
Position the oven in full sun, place food in the smaller box, and wait for it to cook.

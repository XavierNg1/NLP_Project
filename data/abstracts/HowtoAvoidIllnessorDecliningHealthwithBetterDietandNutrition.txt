Understand that healthy eating includes seeking a "balanced diet".
Avoid junk food -- instead, eat nutrient-dense foods.
Get quality sources of protein.
Consider supplementation of Omega 3 or Omega 3~6~9.
Understand the importance of Vitamin D. It is now being recognized that many people in the U.S. are chronically vitamin D deficient (2/3 of the country, even in southern California; the sameÂ % that are overweight), due to poor uptake or lack of dietary vitamin D; and, like Omega 3~6~9, the response here was so large, that that information is now here.
Get calcium from dark-green plants.
Find a good "whole food" vitamin.
Look into a food co-op in your area.
Take steps to aid the digestion of anything that tends to cause constipation.
Determine your blood chemistry.
Get a basic handle on the "Glycemic Index"; it should take about a half-hour on the web.
Examine why you, personally, are eating.
Listen to your body.
Consider fasting occasionally.
Don't get overwhelmed.
Recognize that any change is initially unpleasant.
Avoid stress, unless it is good stress (eustress): joy, being happy and laughing may make your belly and face ache, and cause smile lines and crows-feet -- but your soul, brain and heart should feel wonderful!

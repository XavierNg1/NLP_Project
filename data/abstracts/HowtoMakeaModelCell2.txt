Gather your materials.
Make the jello, but with less water than the instructions call for.
Place your plastic bag inside a sturdy container, such as a large bowl or pan.
Wait until the gelatin in almost set, about an hour.
Add a variety of candies to the bag of jello to represent the parts of a cell.
Create a key showing how the candies correspond with the parts of the cell.
Re seal the completed jello model and put it back in the refrigerator.

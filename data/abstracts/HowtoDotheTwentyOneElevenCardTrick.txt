Hand your friend a stack of twenty one playing cards.
Deal the cards out in three columns, working row-by-row (1st column-2nd column-3rd column, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, etc).
Gather the three columns into one stack of cards again, being sure to put the pile that holds their card in the middle of the three piles.
Repeat the past two steps two more times.
If you have done the card trick correctly their card will be the 11th card in the pile of cards.

Your amazed friend may ask you how you did this.

Use simple percentages to get a basic estimation if you don't have a calculator.
Multiple your height in centimeters by .10, or 10%.
Multiply your 10% answer by 4 to estimate your height in inches.
Divide by 12 to determine how tall someone is in feet.
Alternatively, divide your 10% answer by 3 to get your rough height in feet.
Understand that these estimations will always come out a little taller than reality.

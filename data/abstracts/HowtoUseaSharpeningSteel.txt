Remember that a honing steel will not sharpen a dull knife.
Hold your steel firmly in your hand, or hold it against a counter top.
Place the bottom (heel) of the knife edge against the steel as if you were going to cut into it.
Run the knife down the steel smoothly, as if you were whittling a stick.
Flip the knife and repeat the process, honing the other side.

Repeat 3â€“6 times per side.
Wipe the blade clean with a towel or paper towel.

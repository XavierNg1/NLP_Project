Identify why you are making the call.
Write down your key questions and any information you think they will need.
Have a pen and pencil handy to jot notes, so you don't have to ask somebody to wait while you find them.

,
Eliminate distractions.
Mentally prepare (or jot notes, if you like) for different possible responses.
Drink a small amount of water before you call.
Clear your throat and get your voice started before you dial, especially if you've been working quietly for a time leading up to the call.

,
If possible, place the call when you're not in a hurry to do something else.
Remember that the person on the other end of the line may be just as nervous as you are.
Make that call!

Hydrogen atom is the simplest atom of all the elements in the periodic table.
This theory although was successful to solve the orbital energies for the hydrogen atom was not possible to be applied to other atoms.
Removal of the only electron in the hydrogen atom by ionization forms a positively charged hydrogen atom which is called a proton because it has only a proton confined to the nucleus.
Adding an electron to a neutral hydrogen atom forms a reactive species that is called a hydride.
Covalent bonds between atoms and hydrogen do also exist.
Isotopes of hydrogen are known in which one neutron exist in the hydrogen nucleus along with the proton.
The binding of two hydrogen atoms form the hydrogen molecule.NaH + H2O-> H2 + NaOH

,
It can also be prepared from dissolving of sodium metal in water according to the following equation:

,Na + H2O -> H2 + Na2O

,
Hydrogen molecule can add across a double bond using a catalyst such as palladium or Pd.

,
Hydrogen bonds are special type of electrostatic interaction that happens for example in a solution of pure water.

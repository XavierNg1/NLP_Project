Collect partially used candles.
Purchase needed supplies and containers.
Find a large saucepan that will accommodate the amount of wax you will use.
Place the saucepan on the stove on low heat.
Prepare the candle holders while you are waiting for the wax to melt.
Check the wax and stir until any remaining chunks are dissolved.
Use a mesh strainer and pour the hot wax through into another pan.
Pour the hot wax into your candle holders.
Place the full candle holders or molds on a flat surface out of the way of foot traffic so the wax can harden evenly.

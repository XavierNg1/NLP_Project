Breathe.
Face the crowd (look front and not up, towards the stars!),
Before you speak take note of the time (you should know what time it is to correctly greet the audience).

,
Don't begin abruptly.
Try to make your starting line captivating.
Try to relate what you are going to speak on with things that you already know.
Your mind is a huge database, take the trouble of accessing it!

,
Link what you already know with the topic that you are going to speak on.
While speaking, visualize.
Smile!

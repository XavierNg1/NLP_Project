Only pack what you need!,
Don't bring jewelry if you are going on an outdoorsy trip.
If you want to bring/wear makeup on the trip, you should only bring basic items.
Don't bring all your electronics!,
Bring small board games like Travel Monopoly or Trouble Mini.
Another key to packing minimal is compacting what you have into a small space.
Don't forget important things.
You won't be sleeping in a 5-Star Hotel, most likely.

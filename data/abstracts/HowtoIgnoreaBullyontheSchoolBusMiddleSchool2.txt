If the bully persists throughout the whole journey, turn around and ask them politely but firmly to "Please stop saying nasty things about me, because it's really irritating and annoying.",
Catch the pranks and respond with disdain.
When the bully taunts you and calls you mean names, fight back with words!,
Don't listen to what they say.
Remember that bullies are just bad, sad people.

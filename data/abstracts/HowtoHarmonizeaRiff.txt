Create a riff.
Determine what notes you are using, and try to figure out what scale you are using.
Decide whether you're using a major, or minor key.
Use the scale constructed in step 2 to determine the key your riff is in.
Write down the notes of your scale, and write the scale intervals (Roman numerals) underneath each in order.
Decide what interval you want to harmonize in.
Using the list you wrote in step five, write the notes down again, adjusting them for the interval you chose.
Using this finished list, play the riff again, playing the notes that are underneath the original notes.

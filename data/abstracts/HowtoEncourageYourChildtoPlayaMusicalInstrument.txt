Get very young kids started with whatever musical instruments you have on hand.
Buy toy instruments for slightly older children.
Consider hiring a private tutor once your child is old enough to learn a real instrument.
Encourage your child to join the band or orchestra program in school once they are the required age.
Stay involved with their practice as they continue to grow.

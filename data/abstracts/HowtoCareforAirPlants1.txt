Water air plants every two to three days during spring, summer and fall.
Give your plant a heavy soak once a week, instead of watering it lightly every 2 to 3 days.
Help your plant out if it is not getting enough water.
Set the air plant near an east-, west- or south-facing window if possible but not in direct sunlight.
Use a fluorescent lamp to provide additional light.

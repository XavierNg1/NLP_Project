Show kindness, respect, and acceptance.To build trust, it is important to show that you are kind, respectful, and accepting of the other people.
Spend time with them.
Be sincere.Meaningless flattery and only telling someone what they want to hear isnâ€™t the same thing as kindness.
Be accessible.When your friend texts or calls you, try to reply or call them back as soon as you can.
Listen without making judgments.

Dump out the drawer.
Once your junk drawer is completely empty, give the drawer a quick wipe down with a moist paper towel.
Take all of the pens you find in the junk drawer and test them out on a scratch piece of paper.
Another common item for junk drawers is take-out menus.
Purchase drawer organizers.
Take all of your tools and place them back into your purchased organizers by the type of item.
For all of the tiny items that are hard to compartmentalize (tacks, paperclips, batteries) place them in Ziploc bags by type.
Put all of the loose change in a piggy bank.
Enjoy your tidy new drawer.

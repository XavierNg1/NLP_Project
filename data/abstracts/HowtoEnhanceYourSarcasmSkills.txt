Know the difference between sarcasm and common jokes.
Listen to your surroundings.
Choose a target.
Think before you act.
Say the comment.
Keep that one-of-a-kind poker face.
Make sure the person understands that the comment you just made was a joke.
Calmly walk away knowing that you are better than the rest.

Prepare your horse for the ride.
Warm him up.
Dismount and tie your horse for a moment.
To set up the course, begin with the poles.
To weave the poles, start at one end of the line and simply steer your horse so he goes between the poles.
The barrels are to practice barrel racing.
After that, it's time for the jump(s).
After your horse is finished jumping, it's time for a trail ride.
When you get back from your trail ride, untack your horse.

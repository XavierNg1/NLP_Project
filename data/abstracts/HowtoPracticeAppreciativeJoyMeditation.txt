Find a quiet and peaceful place and select a posture that suits you best.
Start by considering your own experiences and reviewing your life situation.
Consider the tougher facts of life and existence.
Let go of any sorrow and any worry and tension.
Expand to other people starting with the nearest and dearest to you.
Every few minutes, check again for any possible tension that you might be feeling and relax it.
Now, move on to people you know well but don't classify as "intimate".
Ideally (if you feel that you can continue) next should be those who you know but are uncomfortable with, such as those you don't like or trust or those who have been unkind to you in some form or another.
Finally, measure the feelings you now experience against how you gained them and in comparison to before you started.

Purchase a CoinvexedÂ® assembly or kit.
Unpack the contents of the package.
Assemble the components.
Place the pile in your left hand, with the slit in it facing towards the lid of the Sharpie pen, which should be positioned in your right hand.

,
Get someone's coin, and discreetly place it in the slit on the Sharpie pen.

,
Taking the pile, attach it to the coin, so it is in both of the slits.

,
Lean forward, with the coin on the left and secretly put pressure on the assembly.
Put the Sharpie back in your pocket and place the bent coin in the spectator's hand.
Tell them to squeeze their hand, and, sure enough, the coin is bent.

Prepare for your life in your "apprenticeship" as you accept the Master Potter's plan and learn the Potter's Life, Truth and the Way: "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do, he will do also; and greater works than these he will do; because I go to the Father.
Undergo the process of tempering by the Potter to reach your place in making the plans and ideals come to view in yourself and others in the great Potter's way.
Receive molding of your clay: "A person who doesn't love me doesn't do what I say.
Model clay yourself: He can turn a heart of stone to a heart of clay and life of pain to life of gain -- in which He helps others through you.
Accept the firing of the clay to fulfill the great Way in life.
Receive the "fire" through receiving the Holy Spirit and continue studying, learning, and forming in the plan and purpose that prepares you for the pressures of life on your effectiveness as tempered clay.

Think of the F.I.R.E.
Remember the scripture that says that we have the Gospel as a great "...treasure in earthen vessels..."


2 Corinthians 4:7: "We have this treasure in earthen vessels.",
Learn and continue in growing in the plan and promises of God: Go ye into all the world and re/present the Gospel.

,
Form clay to make it into "vessels of mercy" -- being an able "potter" yourself under His training and by His hand, but none come to the Truth unless the Spirit "draw" him/her.

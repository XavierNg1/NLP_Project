Get a band full of people who want to play the same or similar kinds of music.
Remember there are three main kinds of metal: Stuff you want to head-bang to quickly, stuff you want to slowly head-bang to, and stuff you want to go crazy to (jumping around and swinging your arms).
Get one member of your band to come up with their part (lyrics, rhythm or riff) guitar is a good instrument to start with.
Try to be in sync with one another.
Decide on a structure.

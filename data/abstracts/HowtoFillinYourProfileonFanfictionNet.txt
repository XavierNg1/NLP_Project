First, write something along the lines of 'Hi, I'm '.
Now write a sort of things you are interested in.
The next thing you should say is what you enjoy doing on the site.
Your profile is the perfect place to write any announcements.
You may also like to give a summary of all your stories, but they do appear under the 'my stories' tab, so this isn't compulsory, but it's suggested if you need a longer summary.

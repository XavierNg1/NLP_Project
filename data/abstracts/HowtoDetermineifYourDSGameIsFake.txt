The box: this is the very first indication of a not-so-authentic DS game.
The inside of the box: First things first, is there a game booklet?,
If there is no booklet, what else can we look at?,
Time to look at the cartridge itself!,
Alright now we've seen the front, let's turn it over and have a good look at the back.
So if you've performed all of the above steps and found nothing suspicious, that is a pretty good indication that you've picked up a legitimate Nintendo product.
Give yourself a pat on the back for selecting a good eBay seller and not falling into the trap of buying a fake Nintendo DS game.

Get behind your opponent and bring him to the ground.
Wrap your legs around him, to where your insteps are roughly on the inside of his thighs or knees (this is commonly known as "getting your hooks in", the legs/feet being the hooks).
Releasing the seat belt, loop one arm around your opponent's neck: this will typically be the top-most arm in the seat-belt position, just for convenience, but it doesn't really matter.
Using your main-hand, grab the bicep of the other arm.
Making sure to keep the figure-four grip intact, place your unoccupied off-hand against the back of your opponent's neck, to where it's roughly aligned with the arm that's looped around his neck.
Squeeze.

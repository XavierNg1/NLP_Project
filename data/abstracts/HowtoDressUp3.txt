Read the wedding invitation carefully.
Dress in ultra-formal attire if the invitation says “White Tie.” Considered the most formal (think charity balls, royal events and the Academy Awards), you’re limited as to what you should or should not wear.
Wear formal attire if the invitation says “Black Tie.” Considered the next most formal dress, you are expected to wear a tuxedo.
Dress to impress but also for the elements if the invitation says “Beach Formal.” This suggests an elegant wedding on the beach so still dress nice.
Find a happy-medium between casual and formal if the invitation says “Dressy Casual” or “Semi-formal.” A nice suit with a tie, dark or light depending on the time of day, would be a great choice.
Go with business casual if the invitation says “Casual.” Usually, casual means just about anything goes.

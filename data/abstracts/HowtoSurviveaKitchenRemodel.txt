Discuss and make a note of the project stages with your contractor so you have an idea of the process.
Prepare for the big dig by cooking meals beforehand and freezing them.
Decide on where you will be setting up a temporary kitchen while your remodel takes place.
Collect coupons for local restaurants and eateries in advance of the model.
Ask to borrow a kitchen in exchange for a meal, if you cannot deal with the temporary version, you've run out of coupons, or you just want a fresh home cooked meal.
Make a list of places that you can retreat to when you cannot stand the sights and sounds of construction and you need a break from the kitchen makeover stress.
Be patient and understand that a kitchen remodel is going to be a long process.

Start with a square sheet of paper.
Orient your piece of paper so it looks like a diamond – two corners should be directly in front of you while one should be to your left and the other to your right.

,
Fold the paper in half horizontally giving you a triangle that looks like half your diamond.
Fold the paper in half vertically giving you a triangle that looks like half your diamond.
At this point you should have a diamond shaped piece of paper with two folds that intersect at the center of the paper.
Fold the top and bottom sides to the middle.
Fold the left and right sides into the center.
Orient the paper again so it looks like a diamond.

,
Fold the paper in half horizontally giving you a triangle that looks like half your diamond.
Fold the paper in half vertically giving you a triangle that looks like half your diamond.
On your folded piece of paper you will notice the four original corners pointing towards the center.
Repeat steep eleven for every side.
Turn the paper over.
Fold the left and right sides into the center.
Turn the paper over.
Take the top pieces of paper at the center and pull them out giving you a butterfly-looking shape with four triangles in the center.

,
Take the tip of the top and bottom triangles, push them back, and fold them flat.
Take the left and right triangles at the center of the paper (they contain two of the original corners and are facing the long straight edge of the paper) and pull them outwards while making sure the butterfly shape of the overall structure is maintained.
Turn the paper over.
The five sided shapes have five corners – two that face the middle of the paper and three that don’t.
For the left square take the leftmost side and fold it into the center.
Fold the paper in half horizontally.
Pinch the paper right at the line the rectangle and paper make and pull outwards and up slightly.

Remember a time that being HSP has really helped you or another.
Stop comparing yourself to others.Everyone has different personalities, and there is no “right” or “wrong” way to act or feel.
Disregard your “inner critic.”Many people (not just HSP) have a voice inside their heads that constantly criticizes them.
Focus on positive aspects of your HSP traits.Write a list of traits that are unique to your sensitive personality.

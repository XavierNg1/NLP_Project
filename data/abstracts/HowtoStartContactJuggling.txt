'The Cradle.
Palm to Cradle Over the Edge (transfer)– Hold the ball in your open palm, set on the upper, meaty part between the third and second knuckles.
Palm to Cradle Over the Tips (transfer)– Again, set the ball in the open palm as in step 2 but this time the ball will roll over the fingertips rather than the edge of the index finger.
The Butterfly – This is the previous palm-to-cradle-fingertips transfer done back and forth rhythmically so that the ball travels in a fluid figure-eight or windshield wiper motion as it glides to-and-fro.
Beyond - Many more transfers and passes exist and there are also isolation's: keeping the ball in one fixed spot in space while the hands grab, hold and flourish around it as the ball appears to hover.

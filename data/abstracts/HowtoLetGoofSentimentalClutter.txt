Reflect on what sort of clutter proves sentimental in nature for you.
Recognize where the value in the sentimental object emanates from.
Separate the sentimental from the practical and the liberating.
Consider your space allowances.
Develop a series of tests for your sentimental objects rather than seeking to keep them all.
Cut down on the trinkets, letters, cuttings, etc. kept or piled in boxes and other containers.
Use the digital world to clear up the physical space for you.
Set limits and boundaries.

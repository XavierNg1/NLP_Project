Make sure this is who you actually are.
Start by acting a little more bubbly.
Dress a little more happy.
Crazy hair colors and nail polish designs/colors are great!,
Take the craziness to you room, notebooks, and anything else you want to add flair to!,
For an added effect, try eating a little more sugar than usual.
Try to find some hyper people to hang around with.
Don't be afraid to stand out!

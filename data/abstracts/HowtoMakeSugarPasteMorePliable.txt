Knead the sugar paste.
If the kneading doesn't work out, try adding a tiny bit of vegetable fat.
If the kneading and the little addition of vegetable fat hasn't helped, get your dough hook into action.
When rolling sugar paste out, run a palette knife under it every few rolls to help stop it from sticking.
Always leave extra room when covering a cake.

Know what an orbit really is.
Design a ship capable of reaching orbit.
Try breaking the design down into 3 main stages or sections.
Keep 'Delta-V' in mind.
Get in the mindset.
Launch your rocket.
Perform your 'Gravity Turn'.
Burn till your apoapsis>70 kilometers (43 mi).
'Coast' till you reach your apoapsis.
Perform your circularization burn.
Enjoy the view!,
Remember to come back home, point the ship with WASD at the retrograde marker, the yellow circle with the cross through it(against your direction of travel) and burn until your periapsis is below about 20 kilometers (12 mi).

Begin with the integral.
Consider the square of the integral.
Convert to polar coordinates.
Evaluate by means of a u-substitution.
Arrive at the integral of a Gaussian.
Consider the integral of the general Gaussian function.
(Optional) Normalize the area to find the normalization constant a{\displaystyle a}.
Consider the integral below.
If n{\displaystyle n} is even, consider the related integral (written below) and differentiate under the integral.
If n{\displaystyle n} is not even, use the u-sub u=x2{\displaystyle u=x^{2}}.
Set Î±=i{\displaystyle \alpha =i} to obtain three integrals.
Calculate the Fourier transform of the Gaussian function by completing the square.

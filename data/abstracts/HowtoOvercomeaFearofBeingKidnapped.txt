Talk to others about your fear.
Despite seeing "missing" stories from the media, understand that the chances of being abducted by a stranger are extremely rare.
Understand that chain mails about people being kidnapped are almost always untrue.
Remember that you have the choice of not going somewhere alone that makes you feel uncomfortable.
Avoid going to places with people unless someone you trust knows exactly where you are, who you're with, and when you'll be home.
Stick to areas where there are plenty of people around.
To boost your sense of security and confidence, always bring your cell phone with you and make sure it's fully charged.
Always ask someone you trust for help if you're in an uncomfortable situation and/or you feel as if the "friendly" guy who let you go ahead of him in the grocery line is stalking you.

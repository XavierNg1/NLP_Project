Consider carefully the situation.
If you see them by themselves in a social situation, ask if you can sit with them.
If you see them in the hallways, street, cafeteria, etc, smile and wave.
If you are participating in a partner-activity in a class, workshop, exercise class etc, offer to be their partner.
Talk to them in class, in the street, waiting for the bus, in the lift etc.
If you find the person enjoyable, offer to hang out with them after school or work, on the weekends, etc.
If you like them enough to be their friend/companion, continue to interact with them!

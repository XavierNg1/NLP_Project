Maintain a healthy immune system.
Get plenty of vitamin C. Although there is not much research investigating the effects of vitamin C on viruses not associated with causing the common cold, it's clear that ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has potent antiviral and immune boosting properties, both of which are helpful for preventing or minimizing the effects of EBV infections.More specifically, vitamin C stimulates the production and activity of specialized white blood cells, which seek out and destroy viruses.
Consider immune boosting supplements.
Be careful who you kiss.
Treat symptoms if they are significant.
Consider colloidal silver.
Consult with your doctor if your infection is chronic.

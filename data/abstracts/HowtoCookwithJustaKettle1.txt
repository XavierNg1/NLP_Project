Get a large electric kettle, preferably with a hidden element but, as they are expensive.
Boil cans of soup, ready meals, tins of meat and vegetables.
Understand that all canned food is routinely sterilized in an oven immediately after being sealed.
Place the can in the kettle first, cover it with water, and bring it to a boil.
Once the kettle has come to the boil, switch it off.
Wait 10 minutes before switching it on again.
Try using the remaining water to make instant mashed potatoes, but there is no reason why you shouldn't cook boil-in-the-bag rice, pasta, or fresh vegetables in there as well.
Understand that you can accomplish a lot with just one kettle.
Consider purchasing an insulated container of the type sold in Asian shops to keep rice warm.

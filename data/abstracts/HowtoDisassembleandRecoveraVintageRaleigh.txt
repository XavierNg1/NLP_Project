Finding an old Raleigh.
Take notes!,
Simple disassembly.
Loosen brakes and wheel nuts to slide the wheels out easily.

,
Remove all brackets, gear and brake levers...make notes...

,
Most cranks on old Raleighs, are held in place with cotter pins.
As with a modern bicycle unscrew the handlebar mount at the bottom of the headset and remove.

,
You should now have a stripped frame ready for for the fun bit, the revamp.

,
Nitromors is an excellent product for stripping paint off frames, follow the instructions and you can strip a frame in well under a day.

,
Make sure all surfaces are completely sanded down to remove all traces of old paintwork.
Any car or bike shop should have a good range of products for a re-spray.
Replace all brake cables, gear cables and brake pads.
Heavily corroded hubs respond well to sanding, and in extreme cases re-spraying can make them look like new, you really don't need to buy new wheels.
Re-assemble.
Show off to all the east London fixed wheel losers.

Make certain you really, really, really need to drill a hole where you’re thinking about drilling one.
Determine the ideal hole size your application requires.

,
Mark the area where you plan to drill.
Clamp a piece of stone scrap underneath the area where you will be drilling to prevent chipping on the underside of the granite.
Install the desired size diamond drill bit into a high-speed drill or angle grinder with a drill bit adapter.
Begin drilling at a steady speed.
Drill until you’ve gone through the granite target and hit the underlying scrap stone.

,
Cool the drill bit with water in between holes when drilling multiple holes.

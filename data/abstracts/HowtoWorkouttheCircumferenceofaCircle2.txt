Learn what d = 2r means.
Understand π ("pi").
Write down the definition of π as an algebra problem.
Change this problem so you are solving for C, circumference.
Plug in the numbers and solve for C. Look back at the original word problem to see what the diameter equals, and replace the d in this equation with that number.

Admit you have a problem.
Consider the following: Imagine the day that you first bought the game.
Find out what has caused your addiction.
Make it a joint effort.
Set up parental controls for yourself.
Schedule other activities with your free time, so you won't have time to play FFXI.
When all else fails,there is only one thing to do left.

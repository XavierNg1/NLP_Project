Research the realistic compatibility of your new pet being housed with your old pets, preferably before you select your new pet.
Consider the personality of your current pet or pets.
Give your new pet as much time as possible to adjust before meeting your current pet.
Keep your current pet's schedule as normal as possible.
Look for "pre-introduction" opportunities.
Introduce animals slowly and for small periods of time until they are well adjusted to the sight and smell of each other.
Reward good behavior.
Supervise closely.
Be patient.

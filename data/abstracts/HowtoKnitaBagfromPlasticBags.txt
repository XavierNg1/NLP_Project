Take around 40 plastic bags that are clean and 'not' made of degradable plastic.
Cast on as many stitches as you want with needles around size 3-4mm, until your work is as wide as you want your bag to be.

,
Knit until your work is twice as long as you want your bag to be.
Cast off and fold your work in half.
Cast on again, creating enough stitches to knit a narrow strap for your bag.
Make two of these straps, and sew one to each side of the top inside of your bag with about 8 centimeter (3.1Â in) of overlap at each end.

First and foremost, understand that day sleepers are not lazy and don't sleep their entire lives away.
Do your very best not to disturb the day sleeper.
Don't expect the day sleeper to accommodate your schedule just because they keep odd hours.
Don't take offense.
If you happen to live with the day sleeper, try to be as quiet as possible during the day.

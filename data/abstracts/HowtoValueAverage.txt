Select an asset for value averaging.
Determine the amount of your initial investment.
Determine your investment intervals.
Determine how much you would like the market value of your position to increase every investment period.
Make your initial investment, and record the value of your initial investment, the market price, and shares bought.
During the next investment period, determine the value required.
Look up the current market price of the asset.
Determine the shares you need to own, by dividing the value required by the current market price.
Determine the number of shares you need to buy, by subtracting the shares you currently have from the shares you need to own.
Buy that number of shares at the current market price.
Repeat the process during subsequent investment periods.

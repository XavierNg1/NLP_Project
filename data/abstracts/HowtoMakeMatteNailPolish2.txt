Gather your supplies.
Choose your nail polish and powder.
Prepare your powder.
Make a funnel out of a 2 inch by 2 inch (5.08 centimeters) square of paper.
Open the nail polish bottle and stick the funnel down into the neck.
Add in a few pinches of your powder.
Consider adding in two to three ball bearings.
Close the bottle tightly and shake for a few minutes.
Test your polish and make any necessary adjustments.
Let the nail polish sit for 24 hours before you use it.
Be careful of what topcoat your use.

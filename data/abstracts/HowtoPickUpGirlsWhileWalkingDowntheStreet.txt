Always be prepared to meet a new girl.
Dress neatly, in a fashion that reflects your personality.
Figure out where the girls are.
Look like you have a purpose, besides picking up girls.
Try to make eye contact as you pass by.
Glance back and try to see if she noticed you.
Turn back and approach the girl from the side.
Do not stalk the girl.
When you catch up to the girl, first excuse yourself to get her attention.
Try breaking the ice with a casual comment about your surroundings.
Pay her a specific compliment.
Focus on nonverbal communication.
Keep the conversation going, but only if it seems welcome.
Ask for her number.
Know when youâ€™re beat, or when your advance is unwelcome.
Be aware of the line between a friendly pick-up attempt and sexual harassment, and do not cross it.

On your browser, go to My Projects.
Enter the name of our app in the Project name box.
Now drag a Vertical Arrangement component on Screen1 window where we will display our images later.
All the components you drag to Screen1 can be seen under Components pane.
Drag an Image component and place it inside VerticalArrangement1 component that we placed earlier on Screen1.
Get a Label component and place it below VerticalArrangement1.
We need to change some properties of the Label component.
Now we need a Horizontal/Arrangement component where we will place our three buttons.
Inside the HorizontalArrangement1, place three Buttons one after another.

,
Now change the properties of the buttons as follows:


Select Button1 and change its Text property to Elephant, Width to Fill parent, Text/Alignment to Center, and have Font/Bold property checked.
We also need to play sound.
One more tiny thing we should do is change the Title of Screen1 to Wild LifeShow.
Let's get our picture and sound files added.
Under Media pane, click Add and upload the image and sound files one by one.

,
You should see now the following under your Media pane.

,
Now that we are done with the design portion of our app, we need to implement the interactions among the components we have.
On the Blocks Editor window, click on My Blocks which will display all the components we placed on our app through Designer/Viewer window.
Now under My Blocks, locate and click Image1.
We need to set the source of the picture to our image Elephant.png.
The text block indicates which picture to display.
Now locate the Player1 and place the Player1.Source block below Image1.Picture block.
Grab and place Player1.Start block below Player1.Source block.

,
Do the same thing for Button2 and Button3.
You are done!

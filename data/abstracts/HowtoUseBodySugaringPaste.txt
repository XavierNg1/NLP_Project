Gather the necessary supplies and ingredients.
Prepare the sugaring paste.
Keep an eye on it.
Stir in the guar gum using a rapid motion.
Pour the sugaring paste into a storage container or a glass mason jar while it’s still liquid.
Use anywhere there is unwanted hair.
Prep your skin.
Begin with clean, dry skin.
Stretch the paste by pulling it against the direction the hair grows.
Sugar the area numerous times if necessary.
Use the pan on only half the burner, or quickly turn it down if it boils over.
Cook it longer if it melts and is too soft when you try to apply it.
Add water and microwave the mixture if it’s too hard.
Stretch a new piece of sugar over it when some of the paste gets stuck to your skin.

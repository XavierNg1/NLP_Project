Get an old sock that you don't need.
Cut the sock in half, across the middle.
Use the piece with two holes first (leg end and new middle cut end).
Pull the other piece of the sock on your bear's head.
There you go!,
For a bigger teddy, wrap some fabric around where their shirt would be, and cut out arm holes.

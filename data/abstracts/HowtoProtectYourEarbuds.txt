Bind the end caps to the ear buds with glue.
Bind a loop of the earbud cable to the earbud with some sewing thread to keep the cord from getting pulled out of your buds.
Accidentally dunking an earbud in a mug or a cup is another problem and there just a fair chance that your earbuds will work later.

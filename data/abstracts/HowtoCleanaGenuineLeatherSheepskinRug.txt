Give the sheepskin a good brush with a proper sheepskin carding brush while it is still dry to get out as many knots as you can before the sheepskin gets wet.
Handwash or gently machine wash.
Donâ€™t agitate or massage the sheepskin wool too much while washing; you just want a gentle swishing action of water moving through the wool to dislodge dirt particles.
Drain the dirty water and refill the bath with fresh warm water to rinse the last soap and dirt away.
Roll the sheepskin rug up and squeeze out as much water as you can, then let it drain for about 20 minutes.
Dry the sheepskin rug (after spinning out excess water).
Take care not to place the sheepskin on a radiator, steam pipe or in front of a fan heater as this may damage the sheepskin rug.
Use a metal bristle wool carding brush to brush the wool lightly while it is still damp.
Dyed sheepskins should be dry cleaned because washing will most likely remove too much dye coloring.

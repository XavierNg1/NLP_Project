Find reference pictures.
After you've found some pictures, start with the hardest components of the outfit.
Cloud's shoulder armor sits sort of outward on his left shoulder.
Underneath this armor is a flattened leather neck guard that attaches to the bottom of Cloud's armor.
Cloud wears a turtleneck sweater with no sleeves.
His trademark, his long spiky blond hair, is fairly difficult to style unless you use a ton of gel and a blowdryer.
His gloves are easy.
His pants are also easy.
Another difficult yet awesome aspect of Cloud, is the Buster Sword.

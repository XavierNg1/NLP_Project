Onboard your flight, you will be given customs and immigration documents.
When you exit your plane, always follow the signs directing you to international arrivals, immigration and customs.
The first stop is at Passport Control/Immigration.
Give your passport and immigration/customs forms to the officer.
After you clear Passport Control, follow the signs to Baggage Claim.
Once you have claimed your bags, your next stop is at Customs.
If you have another flight to connect with, follow the signs marked "Connecting Flights/Connecting Baggage Drop-off" as you leave the customs area.
If you are already at your final destination, follow the exit and ground transportation signs.

Watch out for homophones.
Use apostrophes correctly:


it’s and its cause problems for many people.
Be aware of noun and verb differences in words like:


advice/advise advice is the noun whereas advise is the verb
practice/practice practice is the noun and practice is the verb (in British English)
affect/effect - affect is a verb , effect is a noun.
Watch out for words that look similar:


dose/does
of/off
quiet/quite
chose/choose
lose/loose
accept/except

,
Take care not to write ‘of’ instead of ‘have’ after modal verbs such as would, could, should, must, may and might.

After you complete the Storage Room, you equip this tool.
In the lower right corner of the screen, on top of your values, there should be a colored circle.
When the circle is flashing red, knock on one of the items in front of you by pressing A. Beware, though!,
If a Boo does come out, vacuum it!,
If you succeed in vacuuming the Boo, Professor E. Gadd will phone you through the Game Boy Horror and ask if you want to save the Boo and all the data you have.
Enjoy doing this throughout the game.

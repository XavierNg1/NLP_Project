Make an outline.
Tape your outline to the side of your monitor and start writing furiously, glancing at it when in need of guidance.
Remember that through your outline you should be able to get some fantastic transitions, where the last sentence in one paragraph is completely congruous with the first sentence of the next paragraph, like this one: â€œThe advent of technology played a huge part in this and helped fuel the growth in political satire.
Keep in mind that another great thing about creating an outline is that in your first run through of thinking about all that you want to talk about and setting it in an outline format, you can jot down lines and phrases that you want to include in your final paper, with such golden phrases as "lackluster ivories" (I'll Never Touch Those Ivories Again, by Jack Schultz) or "balding grumpy old semi-naturalist" (The Vast Cross-Generational Barrier: An Old Man's 'Final Frontier', by Jack Schultz).
Note: Finally, an outline will help your conclusion, which is often the hardest part of a paper.
Have a very strong thesis.

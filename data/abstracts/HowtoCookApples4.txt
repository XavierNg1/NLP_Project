Prepare the apples.
Put all of the ingredients into a large saucepan, and bring them to a boil over high heat.
Simmer the apples over medium-low heat, covered, until they turn tender.
Let the apples sit in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes before serving them.This allows the flavors to infuse better.
Finished.

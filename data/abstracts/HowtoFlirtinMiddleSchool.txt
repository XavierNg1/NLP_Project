Remember to save the moves you use to show a boy you really like them just for the boy you want to like you.
Always look clean and well presented: Shower, brush your hair or put it up, wear deodorant and clean clothes that look good on you and you feel comfortable in.
Be confident when you interact with the boy you like: Confidence is like the magic word that makes every girl gorgeous.
Look at him when he talks to you: If you look at the ground, the walls, your friends, or another boy, he's not going to think you are interested- in fact he'll KNOW you're not interested, because you're too busy checking out the wall!,
Greet him appropriately: If you've been talking for a while, don't be afraid to walk up to him just to say hey.
Don't try to be someone you're not, because guys always like the real girls better: Don't lie about what you've done, who you know, or who you are.
Don't refrain from starting conversations!,
Most importantly, have fun!

Be sure to paint, stain, varnish etc, the palings or pickets before you work with them.
Measure how many you will need to cover each span of rails from post to post.
Run a line of string at the base of the palings.
Nail the palings into place along the string line.
Space the palings.
Draw a line in chalk across the top of the palings to mark the desired height of your fence.

Pick your classes well: Make sure the place you take classes at or the company you are in is a place where you really can be yourself and connect with the teachers and other students.
Do warm up before start: Before starting on with the dance, it pays off to stretch or warm up as it loosens the stiffness in the body.
Drink water.
Time your travel: Get to the studio a few minutes early.
Concentrate: When class begins, clear your mind of everything, except what you are making your body do.
Let yourself free: To be creative in your dancing, find your own style.
Understand the steps: When you are doing a move, think of something else that it reminds you of.
Maintain your posture: You must hold your chin up, your belly in and a smile on your face as you dance.

The goal of the midgame is to protect your carry, to kill the other team's carry and to push towers.
Creeps can be pulled onto the lane to save hp and to deny entire creepwaves to the enemy.
Kill stealing is not advised.
Try not to override the duration of stuns cast on your enemy.
When the lanes collapse try to carry a TPscroll with you at all times.

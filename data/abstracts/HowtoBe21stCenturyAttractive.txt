Spend an inordinate amount of time perusing a variety of social media websites and other pop culture outlets.
Establish yourself on said social media sites.
Post large numbers of photographs of you and your aforementioned attractive friends doing fun and exciting activities (going to parties, running 5ks, posing as a group in clubs/extracurriculars, going hiking/backpacking) and pair them with witty captions and quotes.
Continue to be active on these websites and gain increasing amounts of social connections, so as to appear more popular and attractive to others.

Visit online dating websites such as Tinder, Zoosk, and even Beautifulpeople.com, which allow you to meet others who are likely just as interested in self-promotion and human connection as you are.
Study your role models and their success stories.

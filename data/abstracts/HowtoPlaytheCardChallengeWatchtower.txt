Commence dealing.
Before the game begins, players can take cards out of their army (hand), and place these in their fort.
The player to the left of the dealer starts first and there are many moves available to them.
Build Watchtowers.
Consider challenges.
Beware of the assassins: 7's are used as normal as fort cards but are special assassins in the army.
Complete the watchtower: If you get 4 cards to put in a watchtower of the same number by winning the last card off another player you now have a solid watchtower and no longer need a fort.
Get ready for a showdown: This takes place when everyone in the game is on a campaign.

Forgive others.It can be very easy to hold onto anger if someone has hurt you in the past.
Don’t place blame.While saying that a problem is someone else’s fault might seem like an easy way to get rid of it, things don’t work that way.
Let go of grudges.A grudge is a specific type of emotional baggage that can make a past issue really drag you down.
Focus on changing yourself, not others.Making changes to get over a past problem is difficult.
Give some space if need be.If you have tried unsuccessfully to repair a past personal relationship that is holding you back, it may help to give yourself some breathing room.

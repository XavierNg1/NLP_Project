Mix peanut butter, honey, and milk together in a large bowl to form a very thick mixture.
Roll mixture in small balls about the size of a large walnut.
Roll the ball in either the crushed cornflakes, finely chopped nuts, or powdered sugar.
Place on waxed paper and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes.
Enjoy!

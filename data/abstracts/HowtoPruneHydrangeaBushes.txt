Determine if your Hydrangea blooms on old wood or new wood.
Remove all old blooms at any time no matter what type of Hydrangea you have.
Remember the old wood rule when cutting new blooms for your flower arrangements: you can cut your flowers with long stems before August, but after August, cut new blooms just above the first set of large leaves so that you donâ€™t disturb new developing bloom buds.

,
Prune all dead stems every year no matter what type of Hydrangea you have.

,
Prune all new wood Hydrangeas in the fall and winter.

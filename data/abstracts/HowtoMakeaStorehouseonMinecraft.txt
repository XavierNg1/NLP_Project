Mine some stuff!,
Decide where you want it to be.
Craft some chest to put in it!,
Make the door so it only opens with a switch (optional) so it's harder to get in.
Make a door that locks when someone goes in.

,
(Make this in a hallway of the trap) make a secret underground staircase that you break one block to get to (make it look like the rest just remember where it is), put a chest in it and hide your real stuff.

,
Put a door with a pressure plate to lock the trap room with the fake chest.Also you should make it with lava in the walls so no one can mine in

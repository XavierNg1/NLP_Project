On the night before the dance, get your hair done, a cute top and jeans or a skirt, and a pair of matching shoes.
Skip the cocktail dress, and depending on your school, unless it's semi-formal, consider skipping a dress entirely.
Become familiar with the songs.
Also, don't be afraid to dance with no one at all.
Dance like people are almost not there, just try to get the beat right though.
Make sure you do not sit in the benches or chairs by the wall, trying not to attract attention, when you really want to dance.
When you are having fun dancing to the techno beat or R&B/hip-hop joints, the DJ will unexpectedly say something like, "Hey you lovebirds out there, get ready for the slow dance.",
If you can't find a friend to go with, find one there.
Beware of the cool kids!

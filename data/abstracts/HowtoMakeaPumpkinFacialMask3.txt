Make a pumpkin and yogurt mask if you'd like soft, smooth skin.
Start with 4 tablespoons of organic pumpkin purée.Pumpkin contains enzymes that gently exfoliate away dead skin.
Add 2 to 4 tablespoons (59.1 ml) of plain yogurt.
Add 2 teaspoons of honey.
Consider adding ½ teaspoon of ground cinnamon.While not completely necessary, this can lend your mask a wonderful aroma.
Mix everything together with a fork.
Spread the mask over a clean face.
Wait 15 to 20 minutes.Try not to move around too much during this time, or the mask may start to drip.
Wash the mask off using lukewarm water and circular motions.

Figure out what the winning score should be to end the game.
Know that four players usually play Spades.
Shuffle and deal the cards, distributing them evenly amongst the players until all 52 have been given out.
Pick up your cards, concealing them from their opponents.
Begin bidding.
Use nil bids and blind nil bids, if agreed upon.
Follow the suit of the card placed down first.
Understand that the card with the highest face-value wins the trick, provided it's in the same suit as the lead card.
If a player cannot follow in the same suit as the lead card, either discard or trump.
Do not lead with a trump (any spade card), unless trump has already been broken.
In a four-player game, continue all gameplay until 13 tricks have been played.
After all tricks have been played, teams or players tally up their tricks.
Compare the number of tricks won to the number of tricks bid at the beginning of the game.
If your tricks won exceed the number of tricks bid, give yourself one "sandbag" or "overtrick" point for each extra trick won.
After making sure the points have been recorded, have the dealer collect all the cards and shuffle to begin a new hand.

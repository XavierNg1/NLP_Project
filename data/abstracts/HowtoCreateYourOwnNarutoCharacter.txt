Make a profile for your character.
Take some Naruto quizzes as your character, such as which Naruto character are you, who is your Naruto best friend, what the characters think of you, boyfriend/girlfriend, team etc.

,
Making your own team is great.
Take notes/keep in mind how Naruto characters act, then think about how your character acts.
The Naruto characters' personalities go into how they dress.
You can add some of your own traits, but don't make the character an image of yourself.
Have fun with it.

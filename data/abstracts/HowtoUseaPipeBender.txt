Install the die: Choose a die according to the size of the pipe that you wish to bend.
Install the follower block: The size of the follower block has to correspond with the die.
Prepare the pipe: Take a pipe with a size corresponding to that of the die and the follower block.
Insert the pipe: The follower block is kept loose so as to adjust the height when inserting the tube.
Install the U-strap: The U-strap holds the pipe in place with the lug.
Fix up the drive pin: The drive pin locks the pivot arms to the die, thus facilitating the bending process.
Align the pipe: Adjust the pipe so that the random mark that was previously made lines up with the leading edge of the die.
Create tension in the pivot arms: The pivot arms are usually loose.
Install the degree pointer: Take the pointer and place it on the end of the lug.
Engage the drive rack: Engage the first notch of the drive rack into the sleeve at the end of the pivot arm.
Start the bending process: Pull on the handle and the pivot arms will begin to open.
Reset the bender: Once you have reached the last notch in the drive rack, you need to reset the bender.
Remove the pipe: Once you have got the bends you need, it is time to remove the pipe.

Wash the parts.
Cut the pieces off of the sprue tree with care.
Paint small pieces while they are still attached to the sprue.

Use the right amount of glue on each part or it will not adhere properly.
Apply glue or adhesive only after you have test fit the parts first to see if they fit.
If there are large gaps where the seams of your model are joined, you may need to fill them with body filler putty.
Use newspaper while painting, but try to avoid this paper when gluing.
Use 'white' or 'craft' type glue to attach clear sections.

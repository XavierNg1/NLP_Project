Let your bird calm down.
Keep quiet.
Stroke your cockatiel.
Stroke your bird toward its beak, not its tail.
Scratch your bird’s head.
Massage your cockatiel’s feet.
Look for signs that your cockatiel is happy.
Don’t force your bird to be petted.
Watch for warning signs.
Don’t sexually arouse your cockatiel.
Watch for courtship behavior.
Pet your bird to calm its night frights.
Make a baby bird yawn.
Burp your bird.

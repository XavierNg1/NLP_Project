Know that you must buy the right frame for your style of riding.
Take your inseam measurement, the most important bike measurement there is.
Use your inseam to calculate seat post length for road bikes.
Use your inseam to find the proper length of your top tube for mountain bikers.Multiply your inseam (in inches) by .67, then subtract 4" to 5" from the answer to get the length of your top tube.Use the top-tube for your measurement when possible if you are a mountain biker, as seat tube (pedals to seat) measurements are tricky and change from manufacturer to manufacturer.For example, if you have a 33 inch inseam, you would need a 17.5" top tube (17.75" tubes are hard to find):33" x .67 = 21.75"
21.75" - 4" = 17.75

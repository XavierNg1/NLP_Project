In a large mixing bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, cheese, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper.
Beat the eggs in two separate bowls.

Form the potato mixture into six patties, about Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters) thick.
Dip the patties into the other beaten egg, then dredge them through the breadcrumbs.

Serve the potato patties while they are still hot.

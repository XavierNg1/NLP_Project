Set up your jumps.
Clip lead onto your dog's collar.
Put your dog in a sitting position at least 3–4 yards (2.7–3.7 m) away from the jump.

,
Make sure that there is plenty of space for your dog to start and land the jump.

,
When you have done these steps, start jogging with your dog as you approach the jump, lead in hand.
When your dog obeys your command, give her praise.
Practice makes perfect, so be patient.
Slowly raise the height of the jump.

Take notes and/or pay attention in class so you know what is going on during school!,
Try to know what you are doing ahead of time.
Once the teacher actually assigns whatever it is, immediately read over what you have to do the day it is given and make sure you fully understand it.
Make a schedule, and don't make it unreasonable.
Start your project.
The final week or series of days before the project is due, don't schedule anything major with your friends, and try to decline invitations to things that you can skip, such as a party.
Get a sufficient amount of sleep the week before the project is due.
Finish your project and go to bed knowing you're done.

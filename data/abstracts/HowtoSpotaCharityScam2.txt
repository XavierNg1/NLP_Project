Be wary about charities that withhold information.
Avoid charities that pressure you for a donation.
Make sure the charity can provide proof contributions are tax deductible.
Stay away from charities that advertise sweepstakes.
Avoid cash only donations.
Be suspicious if the charity claims 100% of the money goes to a particular cause.
Pay attention to the news.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and coat a baking dish with olive oil.
Cut and clean the chicken, pounding to your desired thickness.
Crack the egg into a shallow bowl with a pinch of water and beat well.
Fill another shallow bowl with flour and one more with breadcrumbs and cheese.
Using tongs, dip the chicken in the egg mixture, letting any extra run off.
Drop the chicken in the flour, turning to coat.
Press the floured chicken into the breadcrumbs, coating both sides in crunchy crumbs.
Put enough olive oil in a large skillet to lightly cover the bottom.
Cook the chicken on the hot stove for a few minutes on each side, until golden brown.

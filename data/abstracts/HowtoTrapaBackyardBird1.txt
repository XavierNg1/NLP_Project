Use two sticks, a cord, a rock, and your pocketknife to build to an Ojibwa Bird Pole.
Sharpen both ends of the longer pole.
Drill a hole through the pole near one of the ends.
Tie one end of the rope firmly around your rock.
Wedge the thin stick into the hole you drilled.
Thread the string through the hole and tie a small knot in it.
Tie a slip noose knot in the end of the string.
Run the end of the rope through the noose knot, back towards the pole.
Tie a simple overhand knot right where the two sticks meet.
Test the trap by gently pushing the perch down.
Place your trap in an open area, where it is the best option for a bird to sit.
Note that this trap is a supplement for a survival diet, not a main source of food.

Make a territory.
Make up your wolf you're going to be.
Get your pack together.
Have every member draw a picture of their wolf, or specify what fur color, eye color (wolf pups always have blue eyes, but adult wolves usually have different shades of gold or amber, and very, very, very rarely green or blue.
If you want to make your pack interesting, you could have ranks.
Begin the war!,
Hunt, real wolf packs pick out the weakest deer or elk or caribou and then chase it until it gets exhausted.
Take care of the pups.
The day is done.

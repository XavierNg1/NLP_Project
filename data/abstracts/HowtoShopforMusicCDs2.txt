This is a method which may just about work for shopping for any music CD's.
Once you've decided which website you'll search first.
If you've found the Music CD on the website that you are on, you can either purchase it or search other websites to compare.
Once you've made a smart purchase (PayPal is the way to go) and you've received your CD, enjoy it!

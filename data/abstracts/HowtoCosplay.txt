Decide who you want to cosplay.
Decide how you want to go about getting your costume.
If you have decided a character/person to cosplay and choose to make the costume yourself; it's a good start to make a list of what you have to make, how you shall make it and what you need to buy in order to make it.
No matter if you buy the costume, you probably have hair, make up and maybe even lenses to buy and fix.
It helps to sketch up your character from different angles.
Decide how much time (and money) you should spend on making the costume.
Practice on the make up, putting in and taking out the lenses and fixing your hair (or the wig).
When everything is done, put everything on and look in the mirror.
Be confident cosplaying.
Make your grand debut!,
Have fun with it!

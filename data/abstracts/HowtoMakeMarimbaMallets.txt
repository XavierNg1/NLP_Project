Cut the dowels to about 14"-17" in length.
Stick one end of the scissors into the hole in the ball knob, twisting it to shave the inside until to hole is large enough for the dowel to fit into it snugly.

,
Make sure the dowel will slide about half an inch into the ball knob.
Wrap a few rubber bands around the mallet.
Tie a clove hitch around the bottom of the rubber core.
Wrap the mallet once around the shaft (Over the clove hitch) then wrap it OVER the core.
Turn it around the shaft and make a perpendicular "prime meridian" to the first one you made in the previous step.
Turn it around the shaft again and follow the previous 2 steps to make another X.
At the top of the mallet there should be a little nipple where the lines overlap.
Keep wrapping the same way and keep count of how many times you wrapped it.
When done with the number of desired wraps, there should be a little hole at the top.
With the needle, stitch the top of the mallet.
Repeat this pattern tightly.
Using the same "donut" stitching technique, stitch a bottom ring with the 3 inches of slack left in the beginning.
Repeat the steps before this again to make an identical second mallet.
Sand down the dowels to the exact same length and smooth out the bottom if you might use them in a 4 mallet grip.

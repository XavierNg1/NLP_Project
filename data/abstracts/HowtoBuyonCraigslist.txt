Choose a sales category in the drop down list.
Enter a search item, brand and/or kind, for example: you can spell out a search for a "riding mower," or do you need a "tiller," under the category: "Farm and garden" by clicking that.
Create a bookmark/favorite of your search so that you may search easily again the next day or next weekend.
Click the title of an item–in the listing of items found by the search–that you want to examine in detail (to see the seller's ad and description for that item).

Read the ad carefully; be doubtful of fabulous descriptions.
Try replying to the seller with a message sent through Craigslist anonymous secure response link that you can paste into your email to send the request to Craigslist, and then they relay it to the seller.

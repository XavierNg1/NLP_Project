Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C) and line a half-sheet pan with parchment paper.
Mix together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium-sized bowl.
Cream the sugar, butter, and shortening in a separate bowl.
Stir in the vanilla extract, then add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each one.
Alternate between adding the flour mixture and evaporated milk into the sugar mixture.
Beat the batter on medium speed for 2 minutes, then add the sour cream.
Spread the batter over your prepared pan, then bake it for 25 to 35 minutes.
Let the cake cool, then carefully turn it onto another sheet of parchment paper.
Split the cake in half to create two layers.
Use a sheet of thin cardboard to lift the top half of the cake away.
Spread some raspberry jam across the top of the bottom layer, making it go from edge to edge.
Spread a thin layer of buttercream frosting on top of the jam, if desired.
Place the top layer back on top.
Add a thin layer of buttercream frosting on top.
Trim off the edges, then store the cake in the freezer while you prepare the icing.
Assemble a double boiler.
Bring the water to a boil over medium heat.
Pour the powdered sugar, water, corn syrup, and extracts into the bowl, then whisk everything together.
Keep whisking until the mixture turns smooth, then stir in the white chocolate chips.
Consider adding some gel food coloring.
Place a large, wire cooling rack over a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Take the cake out of the freezer, and cut it into small squares using a sharp knife.
Place the cut squares onto the wire cooling rack.
Use a ladle to pour the icing over the top and sides of each square.
Wait for the icing to set, then coat the petit fours again, if needed.
Consider decorating the petit fours further.

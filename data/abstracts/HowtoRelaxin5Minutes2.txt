Neaten your bed.
Lay down on the bed.
Breathe deeply.
Close your eyes.
Pretend that you are in the cleanest, clearest swimming pool and you are floating on it.
Still closing your eyes, move your neck right, then left, very slowly.
Hum a tune.
Stretch gently.
Try to keep your back straight.
Breathe deeply and smile a small smile.
Imagine the voice of a relaxing water fountain and the soft, rustling sound of the water.
Enjoy.

Choose someone to be "the fox".
Get close to 'the fox'.The aim of the game is to get to "the fox" without it seeing you.
However, if "the fox" turns round, the other players must freeze in their position.
The 1st person to tag the fox without being seen wins that round and then becomes "the fox" and the game is continuous until you decide to finish.

Be organized.
Do some packing one or two days before the trip and the rest the morning of the trip.
Have the kids empty out their school backpacks and have them pack their entertainment things, comfort items, and their hygiene things like hairbrushes, toothbrushes, etc in their backpack.
Consider the travel time.
Before you leave the house, make sure everyone has gotten some energy out like maybe tell them to go outside for 10-15 minutes and run around this way they hopefully will not mind sitting for a little while.
For the car ride, have the kids sit with their bags close to them so they won't be climbing around trying to get their things.
Have the kids dress in the same colors so it is easier for you to keep track of them.

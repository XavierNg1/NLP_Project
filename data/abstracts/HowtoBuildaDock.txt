Gather all the supplies you will need to build a dock.
Visit the area of the water where you plan to build your dock, and bring your supplies with you.
Make a square with your 8-foot (2.4 m) long 2-by-8 pieces, and screw them together.
Prepare your barrels.
Add supports to the basic frame you constructed.
Place 4 of your pieces parallel to the center support piece.
Create a perpendicular layer of supports above the layer you just constructed.
Screw in the 4-by-4-inch (10-by-10 cm) pieces for a more secure hold.
Place eye hooks on the bottom support layer where the barrels sit.
Flip over your partially constructed dock.

,
With the help of 1 or 2 other people, carry your dock to the edge of the water and temporarily tie it to something so that it doesn't float away while you finish working on it.

,
Make the top deck layer of your dock.
Push your new dock completely out into the water.

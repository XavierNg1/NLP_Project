Plant your aquatic plant in a container before putting it in water.
Grow tropical and subtropical water plants like Cannas (Canna spp) in a container.
Do not use a container with drain holes.
Use plastic pots without holes, or fabric pots.
Select a container based on how large you want the aquatic pot to grow.
Ask a sales associate at an aquatic plant nursery if you are not sure what size container you should use.
Use loamy clay for aquatic plants.
Buy commercially manufactured aquatic plant potting mix if the native soil is sandy or very heavy clay.
Do not use potting soil that is formulated for regular, terrestrial potted plants.
If you are planting a rhizome, pour moistened soil into the container until it is ⅓ full.
Add more damp soil.
If you’re growing a hardy water lily rhizome, place it at an angle and to one side of the container.
Place additional damp soil into the container over the rhizome.
If you’re growing tropical water lily and lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) rhizomes, center them in the pot.
If you’re growing Cannas, plant them in the center of the container.
For other types of aquatic plants with roots instead of rhizomes, fill the container with ⅔ to ¾ damp soil.
Add ½ to ¾ inch of pea gravel over the top of the soil for all aquatic plants.
Water the aquatic plant right after planting.
Plant the aquatic plants in the spring or early summer in a water feature that gets at least six hours of sunlight each day.
Plant aquatic plants hardy enough to survive cooler temperatures in water that is 50 °F (10 °C).
Plant tropical and subtropical aquatics in water that is over 70 °F (21 °C).
Place them in a spot where there is no more than 6 to 8 inches of water above the pot.
If the pond gets only six hours of sunlight each day, place them at a depth of 6 inches.
Do not lift the plant by its stems.
Keep the container as level as possible when moving it.

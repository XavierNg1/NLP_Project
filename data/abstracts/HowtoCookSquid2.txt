Pat your rings of squid dry with a paper towel.
Consider soaking the rings in a buttermilk bath for tenderness and richer flavor.
Mix 2 cups of flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper in a medium sized bowl.
Coat the rings of calamari in the flour mixture.
Heat up 1/2" oil to medium-high heat on the stove top.
Cook the calamari in small batches until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes.

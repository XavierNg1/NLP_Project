Remember first impressions count.
Address yourself.
Smile.
Make sure you say thank you.
If they are rude to you back, stick up for yourself but not in a rude way.
If you eat dinner with them, have proper eating etiquette.
They are probably going to ask you questions.
At the end of the day, tell them thank you and goodbye.

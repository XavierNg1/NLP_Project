Have the tracks you want to put on the CD ready to burn.
Purchase the plainest and/or cheapest pack of CDs you can find.
Obtain a set of poster paints, the kind that come as a set of 8 connected by bits of plastic.
Chances are the paintbrush that came with those paints will be useless, so pick up a big box of cotton swabs (not necessarily Q-tips and in some cases not actually Q-tips, as they have quite a lot of cotton on their tips).
Have a fan handy.
Set up your workspace.
Either keep a roll of paper towels handy or cut an old towel up into about 12x12 squares.
Expect to have to give your CD a second or even third coat.
Work slowly!,
If you want to write something on the CD, like 'Christmas 2005', paint a background for it and then use a good quality felt-tip permanent marker.
Once the CD is completely dry, check the back for paint.
Play the CD!,
Give to your recipient!

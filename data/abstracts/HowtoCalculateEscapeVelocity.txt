Define escape velocity.
Begin with conservation of energy.
Define kinetic and potential energy.
Substitute these expressions into conservation of energy.
Solve for v.


12mv2=GMmrv2=2GMrv=2GMr{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}&={\frac {GMm}{r}}\\v^{2}&={\frac {2GM}{r}}\\v&={\sqrt {\frac {2GM}{r}}}\end{aligned}}}


v{\displaystyle v} in the above equation is the escape velocity of the rocket - the minimum velocity required to escape the gravitational pull of Earth.
State the equation for escape velocity.
Understand the variables of the equation.
Determine the mass and radius of the planet you are on.
Substitute values into the equation.
Evaluate.

Select your method of imprinting the circuit schematic on the copper board.
Draw the circuit schematic on either graph paper or a simulation programs such as MultiSim or Eagle CAD.
If a simulation program is being used, test the circuit thoroughly in the simulated environment.
Make sure the circuit functions on the breadboard, or in the simulation software.

,
Acquire a circuit board.
Apply a printed design.
Alternatively: Draw out your circuit on your board with the Sharpie.Put on old clothes, gloves and safety goggles.
Warm the ferric chloride, stored in a non-corrosive jar and sealed with a non-corrosive lid, in a bucket of warm water.
Pour only enough ferric chloride to fill a plastic tray that has plastic risers in it to rest the circuit board on.
Use plastic tongs to lay the circuit board face down on the risers in the tray.
Wash all the etching equipment and the circuit board thoroughly with plenty of running water.

,
Drill 0.03 inch (0.8 mm) lead component holes into your circuit board with high-speed steel or carbide drill bits.
Scrub the board clean with a scouring pad and running water.
Gather the following tools:

Hand-held Drill or Drill Press
Various drill bits
Soldering iron
Solder

,
Before drilling, locate all the positions of the through-hole components.
Drill through the board with a bit wide enough to accommodate whatever part must be placed at that location.
Place the components on to the circuit board at their designated locations.
Soldering is a skill that requires practice, although it is not inherently difficult.
Test your circuit board before installing it into its permanent location.

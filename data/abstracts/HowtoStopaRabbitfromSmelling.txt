Smell your rabbit.
Make sure your rabbit uses a litter tray to ensure all urine and droppings are contained.
Clean the rabbits living area at least 1-2 times per week.
Rinse the litter box and other areas with white or cider vinegar to cut smells.

Take your rabbit to the vet immediately for a check-up if your rabbit smells when its cage is clean and he/she has been neutered.
If your rabbit is ill and has a dirty bottom, very gently rinse off the area with lukewarm water or a baby wipe if desired.
Remember not to keep your rabbit's cage outside.

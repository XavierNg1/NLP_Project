Reaffirm to yourself that being relaxed is the natural state of existence.
Stop the monkey mind chattering long enough to figure out what is bothering you.Bring forth thoughts which make you feel relaxed and happy.
Sit or lay down somewhere comfortable.
Feel yourself getting heavier.
Feel yourself getting relaxed and calmer with each exhalation.
Come back to reality.

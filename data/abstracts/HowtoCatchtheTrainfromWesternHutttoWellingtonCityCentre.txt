Realize that the train station is actually on the other side of a pub.
Simply enter the shopping precinct with signs to the "Station Caf√©" and cross the courtyard towards the pub.
Make it obvious that you want to catch the train and that you are not just using the platform for a place to smoke or down a beer.
Note that the Melling - Wellington line only runs weekdays.
Sit back and enjoy the journey into the city center.
Wait until the train draws into a large station.

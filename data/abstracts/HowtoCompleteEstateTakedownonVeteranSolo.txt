First, bring up your sniper rifle and run out the front door of the boathouse.
Take your sniper rifle and run over to (and to the rear of) a large log pile located to the right rear of the boathouse.
From the log pile, move out from the left towards the first small hill right in front of you (with three-sectioned white fence).
Race inside the open doors of the main house and watch out for another bad guy inside.
Take your WA2000 back out to the left of the main house and slowly slice the pie from left to right.
Move slowly and be careful on this side as the guys here are hidden by brush and trees.
Take the WA2000 and go back towards the armory, but instead of going into the armory doorway, take the NEXT left and it's a short hallway with a laundry room.
Switch back to your automatic weapon and make your way up the stairs.
After clearing the guys in the kitchen, make your way to the back of the house.
As you get down to single digit hostile numbers, beware of more juggernauts.

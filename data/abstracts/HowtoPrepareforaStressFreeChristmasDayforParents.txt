Open up your child's toy prior to wrapping it.
Check, test, and assemble the toy.
If you have decided to assemble the toy well in advance of the big day, find a suitable hiding place.
Invest in a 'Build n' Wrap' gift frame and put it together.
Wake up to excited children.
Let children enjoy playing with a toy for a time.

Consider using branches rather than marble or floral foam when arranging your flowers.
Arrange flowers from all sides, not just the side that will be most visible.
Use a clean vase with tepid water, neither hot nor cold.
Give your flower stems a fresh cut.
Remove any leaves or small stems from the main stem of each flower that would be under the water when you position it in your case or jug.
Keep your bouquet in place.
Keep your flowers both well hydrated and well fed to make them last longer.
Cut flower food contains nourishment, a bacteriostat, and citric acid to control PH.
Every couple of days you should replace the water in the vase and re-cut the stems.

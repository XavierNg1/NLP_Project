Gain some experience editing existing instructional videos with Popcorn Maker.
Avoid the following:


Detailed voice narration: Since audio can't be edited in Popcorn, that means that any verbal instructions can't be updated as the instructions in the article are.
When filming, leave enough room in the frame for text and popups.
Keep in mind that music will make the video harder to edit with certain events.
Give each scene enough time for written instructions to be added.
Leave enough time at the end for links to similar projects.

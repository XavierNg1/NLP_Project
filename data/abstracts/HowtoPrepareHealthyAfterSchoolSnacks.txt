Plan ahead for the week when shopping and make a list.
Serve a variety of healthy choices of foods that include grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy and proteins.
Provide grains by using whole wheat crackers and breads to make snacks with and serve with low-fat cheese or whole fruit spreads.
Wash, peel and store vegetables in airtight containers when you bring them home from the store so that you can grab them to make a quick snack during the week.
Buy fruits that are fresh and firm, not overripe, or you will likely end up throwing them out.
Make a dairy rich snack by removing the lid and placing clean popsicle sticks in yogurt containers.
Get a serving of protein by dipping apple or pear slices in peanut butter.
Serve drinks that are not full of sugar or empty calories with after-school snacks.

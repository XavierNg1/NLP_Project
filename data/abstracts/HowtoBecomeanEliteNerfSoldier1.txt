Buy a Nerf gun, preferably a Maverick, because they work well in melee and are balanced and light.
Practice shooting and aiming at larger targets, then moving on to the smaller ones.
Assemble your full weapon arsenal.
Create a gear pack, with 1 or 2 extra guns, easy-access bullets, water-bottles, some healthy food, spy-gear for indoor use, windbreaker, glasses, pocketknife, flashlight, gloves, hat, map of area, walkie-talkies, etc.

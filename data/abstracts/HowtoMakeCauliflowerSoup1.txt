Prepare the cauliflower.
Bring the water and salt to a boil in a medium-sized saucepan.
Add the cauliflower florets, and cook for 4 minutes, or until the cauliflower turns soft and tender.
Fill a blender or food processor halfway with the cooked cauliflower.
Fill the blender or food processor a quarter of the way with the cooking water.
Purée the cauliflower until it turns smooth.
Pour the mixture into a separate saucepan, then continue puréeing the rest of the cauliflower.
Add some salt and butter.
Bring the soup back to a boil.
Give the soup a final stir, then serve it while it is still hot.

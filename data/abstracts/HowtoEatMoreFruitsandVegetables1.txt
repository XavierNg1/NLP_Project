Think ahead to eating more fruits and vegetables and less junk food, and buy your foods accordingly.
Purchase frozen fruits and vegetables for convenience or when fresh are not in season.
Purchase canned to stock your pantry and for cooking.
Purchase purees and juices for cooking or eating “on the go.” Purees are useful for making smoothies and adding sauces.

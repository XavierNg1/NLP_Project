Wait a while.
Reflect on the problems your relationship faced.
Make little changes now to show that you're different.
Think about what you want.
Find out what he's up to.
Reach out.
Meet somewhere in public.
Look your best.
Tell him how you feel.
Apologize, if necessary.
Listen to what he has to say.
Don't expect an answer right now.
Give him some time to think it over.
Make plans to get back in touch.
Live your life in the meantime.
Start slow, if you decide to get back together.
Call out problems when the rise back up.

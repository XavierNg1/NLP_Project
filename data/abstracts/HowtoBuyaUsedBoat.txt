Decide what kind of boat you want.
Spend about a week looking and comparing prices on used boats you like.
Once you have found what you think is a reasonable price, for a boat you feel suits your needs, call the owner or talk to the dealer.
If, after all these questions, you are still interested, make an appointment to see the boat, and let him know you want to take it out on the water.
When you look at the boat, note any fixed hull cracks, see if any parts look newer than others, and look for signs of neglect.
Find out why the boat is being sold.

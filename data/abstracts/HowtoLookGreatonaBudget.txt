Ignore trends.
Only wear what looks good on you - if you're long-waisted with a soft tummy, don't wear low-waisted pants.
Go to the drugstore for beauty and hygiene products.
Be thrifty with hair products.
Check out thrift stores.
Buy the basic things.
Be creative: altering and mending old clothes/clothes from the thrift store can be great fun.
Don't go for the super-expensive jeans.
Invest in good timeless pieces: splurging on your favorite jeans or boots can be an investment for years.

Don't worry about where you shop - the important thing is whether the item fits, is flattering and a good color.
Shop for off-season clothing.
Look for versatility.
Make sure your new clothes are machine washable.
Go to a discount chain for your trendy shoes - you can get cheap, fun stuff there, because you don't need it to last more than a season or two.
Stick with the basics for makeup: mascara, lip gloss, blush, concealer, and maybe some liner and shadow.
Use men's shaving cream.
Have a black, a brown, and some summery shade (white is classic, but a pale gray or a subtle metallic can actually be more versatile) of purse - they don't need to match your shoes.

Start off with the toiletries.
Be sure to have the right types of tops.
Be aware that for bottoms, it's OKAY to wear the same pairs of shorts multiple times during the cruise, most people do - and it would be crazy to waste money on 7 pairs of shorts.
Don't forget a few dresses.
For shoes, don't bring every pair of shoes in your closet.
Have something to fix up your hair.
Always bring sunglasses, especially if it's a summer cruise.
Hats (optional).
Don't forget your swimming suit(s).
Don't forget the extras.
Makeup (optional).
Bring some of your own money.
Be sure to have a few Snacks.

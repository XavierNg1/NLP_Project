Determine what type of problem it is.
Draw a picture.
Label the distances and velocities given in the problem on your picture.
List all your variables.
Make sure the units match.
Use physics constants to fill in some unknown variables.
If your problem is set up like scenario (2), make sure to use the angle given to break up the initial velocity into x and y components.
Pick a kinematic equation to use.
Find the similar variables.
If there is not an equation you can use to solve for your desired variable, use a kinematic equation and solve for a different variable.
After finding the intermediate variables, use them to solve for your desired variable.
Make sure you include units and draw a box around your answer.

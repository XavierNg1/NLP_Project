Remember that every part of your body and everything on your person has the potential to be used as a weapon.
Open your hands and keep them in front of you in a pleading position when confronted by a potential attacker.
Scream.
Block or dodge an oncoming attack.
Strike with the heel of your hand, or with the meaty little-finger side of your fist.
Aim for sensitive areas such as face, stomach, groin, knee, shin and instep.
If you are in close proximity to your attacker, jabbing with your elbows and fingers can be an effective method of defense.
If necessary, use any hard item available to poke, jab or scratch your assailant's face: a stick, a brick, a pen, a piece of glass, etc.
NEVER kick your attacker in the groin, this gives them a chance to grab hold of your leg.
Using the heel of your palm, hit the attacker's nose upwards.
Squirm.
Once you have taken your attacker down and they are no longer a threat, stop attacking.
Call police once your attacker is no longer a threat.

Cast on 15 to 20 stitches.
Measure around the body just below the armpits, over any garments you will be wearing under the sweater.
Cast on your key number of stitches on a circular needle, join and knit around until you have the length you want for the body.
Put these stitches aside.
You now have a body and 2 sleeves.
Knit across the front, across one sleeve, across the back, across the other sleeve and you should be back where you started at the front again--all the stitches should be on one set of knitting needles.
Before you get any further, measure from below the arms (where you have knitted to so far) to the top of the shoulder.
Divide the number of stitches that you will need to decrease by 4, since you will decrease four times per row, once at each stitch marker.
Continue knitting, making sure to decrease at the markers.
Keep trying it on, stopping when it fits right rather than when you may have planned to stop.

,
Continue to pick up stitches if desired evenly around the neck and rib for a bit if you want.
Finished.

Don't just plant the cheapest stuff, subtract the cost of the crop+15 coins from the coins you get for selling them and determine the profit (strawberries have a 10 coin profit).
Plant about 16 of each crop.

Don't let the crops wither, or it would only waste money.

Manage Costs: These costs are easily managed of course because you're harvesting and selling your crops for more than it cost to plant them.
Maximize yours earnings per hour: Because you'll be needing your coins for so much in FarmVille, you need to maximize the earning potential of your farm.
Manage Time: If you're not going to be able to get back to your farm for 8 hours, you're much better off planting the pumpkins.

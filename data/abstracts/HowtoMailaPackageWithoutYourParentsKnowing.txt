Before you do anything, you need to get a box to mail your item in.
PaddedÂ envelopes can be put in the mailbox, but there is a size and weight limit.
Find out where the nearest post office is.
Decide where you're going to mail the package from.
Consider your methods of transportation and how you're going to get home.
Come up with a good story to tell little siblings who are going through the tattletale phase, strangers who ask where your parents are, or your angry parents who found out you took a detour after school.
On the big day, act normal.
Hide your package in your backpack, or if it's really big, get it out of the house when your parents aren't around and hide it somewhere.
After mailing the package, either destroy the receipt or throw it out somewhere that isn't at home.
Get home as quickly as possible and give yourself a pat on the back!

Come to terms with the event yourself.
Decide how you're going to handle this.
Act perfectly normal.
Don't hide.
Make new friends.
Talk to all of your old friends and acquaintances normally, whether they know about your embarrassment or not, act like it didn't happen and so will they.
Get your mind off it.
Do something else big, so that people will talk about that instead of your summer.
If people start teasing you to your face, you have another opportunity to own the story.
Realize you are going to remember this longer than anyone else will.

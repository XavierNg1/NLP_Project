Using warm water, start with a moisturizing bar soap.
In the morning it is good to start off with a clear smooth face.
As a teen you do probably have a bit of acne(like dozens of other teenagers!).
You know what's great to try?Pads - for your face!Swipe one on and allow it to dry.
Then smooth on a lightweight moisturizer (preferably one with SPF) and the skincare is finally over!

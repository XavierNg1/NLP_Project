Look for spinach with green, crisp leaves.
Check the stem and buy accordingly.
Avoid bags or containers with excessive moisture.Excess moisture will cause the spinach to rot.They will also perish more quickly if stored in a wet plastic bag.
Know that fresh spinach isnâ€™t necessarily the best option.

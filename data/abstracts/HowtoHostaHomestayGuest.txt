Make sure your guest is not allergic to your pet or anything else that may be hard to avoid in your home.
Be natural and welcoming to your guest.
Try not to discuss payment and household rules on the first day your guest is in your home.
Donâ€™t assume that your guest will be familiar with your country's customs and traditions.
Make sure that they always carry your address and home phone number.

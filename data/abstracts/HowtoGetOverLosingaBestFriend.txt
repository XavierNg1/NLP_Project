If this friend wants nothing to do with you, for whatever reason, there is only one thing you need to accept.
Accept that people change.
If you lost a friend over a fight, such as from telling them how you feel, and they won't forgive you, it's their loss.
Take time to mourn over your loss.
Let go.
Do things to get your mind off of this loss.
Join a club, or a hobby group.
Consider getting to know some of your current friends better.
Rejoice in how deeply you care for people and find someone who needs a compassionate pal like you!

,
Remember that life goes on.
If your best friend moved away rather than ended things, try to keep the friendship alive.
Be realistic about the friendship.
Keep in touch.

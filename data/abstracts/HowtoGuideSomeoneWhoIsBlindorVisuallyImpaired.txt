If you see a stranger with a white cane or a guide dog, it is very likely that he is visually impaired.
Ask if they would like you to take them there or if they would like directions.
If they would like you to guide them there, touch your arm to their arm.
If navigating narrow spaces, let the person know that there is a narrow space ahead.
If you come to stairs, tell them whether the stairs are going up or down.
If you need to change arms, never let the blind person lose contact with you.
Coming to a doorway, explain to them which direction the door opens: towards you or away from you and on your right or left.
Tell them whether you are turning left or right.
When taking a seat, place their hand on the back of the chair.
Before you leave them, ask if there's anything else you can help them with.

Think.
Make sure you're alone.
Wear something comfortable.
Grab a hairbrush, or anything else you can use as a "microphone.",
Stand in front of a full length mirror.
Turn on the tunes.
Get a Feel for the Music.
Go for it!,
Watch yourself in the mirror.
Look at the Pros!,
Emphasize the positive.
Strut your stuff in public.
Eliminate the negative.
ENJOY YOURSELF!,
Practice combinations.

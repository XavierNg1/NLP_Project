The very first thing you should do is ask yourself if a reptile is the right pet for you.
Before you buy any animal, you need to do research on the animal you're thinking of buying.
Once you have decided what type of reptile you want, research as much as possible!,
Now that you have all the equipment you'll need, go ahead and purchase your reptile!,
After a while of keeping your new arrival and after you feel very comfortable husbanding this animal, start expanding!,
Remember that each animal must be well researched before purchasing.
A good theory 'plink' sound money makes when being dropped on the counter.

,
Do things correctly from the beginning and you (as well as your animal) will have a much easier time.

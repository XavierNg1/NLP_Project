Identify a canonical (preferably official) Facebook page associated with the topic where applicable.
In the case of official pages, identify relevant metrics including:


Number of page likes.
Compare the metrics for the page with metrics for pages of competing entities, to put it in better context.
Adjust for fake likes and shallow likes.
Outside of, and in addition to, official pages, use the appropriate metrics that make sense.

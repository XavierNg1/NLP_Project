Choose wisely.
When on the field, run at a normal speed, not too much to tire you out and not to slow to make it obvious that you aren't trying.
Hang around the other team.
Make sure you don't get anyone's flag.
When you are out, go to the very back of the line.
If you can choose your position, choose defence.
If playing defence, don't move from your spot and make sure that you watch the ball and maybe step closer to the side of the gym that the ball is on to make it seem like you want to get it.

,
Move your stick around every once in a while.
Look engaged.
If you are doing push-ups, go all the way down and stay for the amount of time that everyone else takes to do two.
Bend a lot.
For sit-ups, only sit up halfway.
Choose the right weights.
Act puffed out.

Pick the Active Camouflage (from here on called "AC" for simplicity) only in a suitable map.
Don't camp.
Move a lot and slow.
Always crouch.
Use when needed.
Keep track of the radar jammer.
Be unpredictable.
Never taste your own medicine.
Be aware of radar jammers interfering with yours.
Try to locate their position by using their jammer against them.
Like said before, be unpredictable.
Sometimes standing still with AC and letting them pass works and gives you the best opening for an attack.

,
Distortion in the area can easily give someone away, so you must be careful even when you're invisible.

,
Attacking is NOT needed.
Silent kills only.
Be patient and time perfectly.

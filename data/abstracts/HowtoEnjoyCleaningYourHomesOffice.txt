Start out by having a family member or friend, who will not be helping you, write down what you need to clean.
Turn on some of your favorite music!,
Get a sibling involved!,
Once you become bored with this game, or you think you have finished cleaning, check the list.
Now, all the trash and clutter is gone.
Now, break out the duster, soap, and sponge!,
Sweep, and mop, the floor until it's shiny.
Now, you're done, and the room is fabulous!

Always look directly at the top of the camera.
Stand as straight as you can and keep your chin up.
Avoid direct angles, instead coming in from above, below, or slightly to the side with the camera.
Consider squinting slightly to exude confidence.
Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and open them right before the camera clicks.

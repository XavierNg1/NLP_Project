Really think about if anyone at your school would join.
Contact a school administrator for permission, preferably the principal.
Find a teacher or parent to supervise.
Compose a list of books that you want to read.
Think of a time to meet.
Do you know what you'll actually be doing?,
Get some members!,
Establish some rules.
After the meeting, make sure that they know when the next one is.

Cut a long band of elastic.
Try on the pants again.
Pin the elastic band together at the point that you marked with your fabric pen.
Choose a 4-way stretch knit fabric or tight t-shirt to use for the section of the bands that will fit over your stomach.
Measure your elastic band with a fabric measuring tape.
Cut a length of knit or t-shirt material that is equal to the width measurement.
Pin the ends of the fabric together to form a loop, as if you are trying to make a tube top.
Fold the fabric tube in half so that the back sides are touching.
Measure a casing for your elastic.
Mark the measurement with a fabric pen or piece of chalk.
Sew along that line using a zig zag stitch.
Insert your elastic loop into the bottom of the fabric loop.
Sew a seam just below the elastic band around the entire tube.

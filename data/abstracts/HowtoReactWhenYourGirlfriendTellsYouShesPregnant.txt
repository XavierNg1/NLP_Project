Listen to your girlfriend.
Stay calm.Take a deep breath before responding to what your girlfriend tells you.Don’t freak out, yell, say it’s her fault, say that your lives are ruined, or anything else overly dramatic.Recognize your own emotions.You might be confused, excited, angry, happy, or feel a combination of all of these.
Let her know you care.Assuming that you will try to be supportive of your girlfriend, you should react by showing that you care about her and the situation, and will support any decision she makes.
Keep in contact with your girlfriend.
Make sure she is pregnant.
Learn about your options.Your girlfriend may have several options for handling a pregnancy.
Be patient.Deciding how to handle a pregnancy, or share the news of it, can be very stressful.
Talk about it.Maybe your girlfriend knows exactly what she wants to do about the pregnancy.
Help your girlfriend tell others.
Ask for help.
Get the information you need to make an informed decision.Becoming a parent, or the possibility of becoming a parent, involves a wide range of personal, emotional, physical, medical, and legal concerns.Even an option that seems like an obvious choice will come along with its own issues and things to deal with.
Talk it out or compromise if you don’t agree.If you and your girlfriend don’t agree on what to do, you will have to realize that in almost all cases the decision about a pregnancy is ultimately up to the woman.
Care for your girlfriend if she has an abortion.
Prepare for the changes pregnancy can cause in a relationship.
Get the knowledge and equipment you need to be ready for birth.You can make the birthing process less stressful by getting all of things a newborn will need (food, clothing, bottles, diapers, etc.),
Work with an adoption agency, if applicable.

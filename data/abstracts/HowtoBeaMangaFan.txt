So you have heard of manga, and want to become a fan.
There are a lot of types on manga.
If you don't like the idea of sitting at a computer reading it, Borders sell a nice selection of manga.
If you have little pocket money, you can also go to the library.
You may need to learn a bit about Japanese culture, food etc.
You may find manga unusual at first, but after a while it becomes a great hobby and can make great conversations with friends at school etc.

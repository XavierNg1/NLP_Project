Remove your clothes and wear whatever makes you comfortable.
Before the massage, a hot sauna or shower, if possible is nice.
Lie on the table, and be aware of your breathing.
Try not to talk for most of the massage.
As the therapist moves the sheet to work on a part of your body, don't move for them or hold limbs up as they secure the sheet.
Think of your massage not just as one artist doing his or her job but two artists - you and the therapist - working together.

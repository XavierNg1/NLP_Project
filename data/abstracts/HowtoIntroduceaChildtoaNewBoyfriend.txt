This first step is one that should be considered in all new relationships where a child is concerned.
Consider your child's age before you make any introductions.
Before you introduce the child to the new man in your life, consider name dropping or voice calls.
To make the introduction on the child easier, keep the venue neutral and in an area where the child feels at ease and happy.
When introducing the child to your partner, it's probably best to introduce him as a friend at the beginning.
To make the transition as easy as possible for your child, try to keep things as simple as possible, particularly in the beginning.
Help your partner bond with your child by telling him about what your child likes & dislikes in advance.

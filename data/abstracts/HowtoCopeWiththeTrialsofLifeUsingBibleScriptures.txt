Consider that the spiritual fight is not against flesh and blood but against evil powers as stated in Ephesians 6:12.
Put on the full spiritual armour of God so that: when the day of evil comes you may be able to stand your ground and after you have done everything to stand Ephesians 6:13.

,
Put on the belt of truth.
Put on the breastplate of righteousness.
Put on the shoes to proclaim the gospel of peace - with your feet fitted with the readiness to go that comes from the Gospel of peace.
Take up the shield of faith with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
Take the helmet of salvation: Think thoughts that are good and acceptable to the Lord.
Take the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God.
Pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests.

Decide when and where you are going to go.
Take time to map out a detailed route.
Try to limit your daily driving distance to a specific timeframe of 1 to 4 hours.
Pick at least 1 sight or attraction that you would like to stop at in each state.
Research and book your lodgings beforehand so you are not wearily searching for a place to stay in the middle of the night in an unfamiliar place.
Learn all the sights and attractions on or around your route, and then create a list of everything you wish to visit before you leave for your trip.
Purchase and set your GPS system before you leave.
Make sure that you get your vehicle serviced completely, assuming you are bringing your own car.
Bring lots of healthy snacks and drinks for the ride, especially if you have children.
Pack for your tour across the United States by selecting mix and match items rather than outfits.

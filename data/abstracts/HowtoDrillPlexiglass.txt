Wear safety goggles.
Buy a plexiglass drill or plexiglass drill bits that can be used with a regular drill.
Practice with smaller pieces of scrap acrylic before attempting to drill into a large sheet.

,
Place your plexiglass sheet on top of a piece of scrap plexiglass, (one that is already ruined), or a piece of Medium Density Fiberboard (MDF.),
Clamp both sheets to a secure surface.
Make sure that the hole you will cut is not near the edge of the plexiglass piece.
Plug in your drill or place a charged battery inside it.
Start to drill slowly into the sheet of plexiglass.
Keep a steady, slow pace.
If your sheet is thick, do peck drilling, going a little at the time so that you can remove the shavings from your hole and allow the drill time to cool.

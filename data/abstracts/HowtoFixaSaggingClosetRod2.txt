Measure your current closet rod's diameter, and how far it hangs away from the wall.
Locate a stud near the center of the closet rod, or two studs equidistant to the center, with a stud finder.
Remove all the clothing from the rod.
Drill the appropriate starting holes for the mounting hardware that came with your new closet bracket or brackets.
Drop the closet rod back into place.

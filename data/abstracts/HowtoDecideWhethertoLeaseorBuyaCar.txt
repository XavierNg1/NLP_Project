Consider your trade cycle history.
Estimate what you can spend on a down payment if buying, and how much you can spend per month on monthly payments.
Some leases may allow you to spend less monthly than buying.
Take all the payments and up front charges and see totals before you decide.

Term, options, and next purchase intentions should factor in your decision.
To save money in the long term, consider buying or leasing a car that's just not new.
Leasing allows you to have more car now than you would be able to buy for the same dollars.
Determine the mileage you expect to put on your car while you own it over the next 2-3 years.
If the average market price is less than the value of the vehicle on the lease, then let the lessor take it back.
If you're considering buying a used car, the warranty might be either expired or close to expiring so ask about an extended service contract.

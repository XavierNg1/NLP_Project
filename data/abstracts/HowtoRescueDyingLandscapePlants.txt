Assess your plants' watering needs.
Buy a lawn sprinkler, a garden hose, an automatic water timer, and an inexpensive rain gauge.
To figure out how much water your lawn sprinkler is putting out per hour, set the rain gauge in its path while watering.
On subsequent waterings, set the timer for the time needed to get an inch of water.
Water your landscape on a regular schedule even if it looks like it may rain.
For the first week of plant rescue, water the landscape so it gets 3 inches (about 8 cm) the first week.
For the second week of plant rescue, water the landscape so it gets 2 inches (about 5 cm) the second week.
For each week thereafter, water once per week so the landscape gets one inch (25 mm) per week.

,
For each week thereafter, water each tree once per week so each gets 2-3 quarts for every foot in height (per week).

,
At week three, get nutrients on your landscape.
Follow the fertilizer package directions and apply balanced liquid fertilizer to your landscape using the garden feeder that attaches to your sprinkler.

,
Fertilize once per month thereafter during the growing season, unless the package directions indicate otherwise.

,
Amend your soil by applying compost or composted manure.
Compost or manure can be obtained at garden centers or hardware stores in 40-pound bags for under USD$3 per bag.

,
Follow directions for spreading the compost on the bag.
If your landscape is mulched, rake away the mulch before applying the compost.
Apply compost or manure only once per year.

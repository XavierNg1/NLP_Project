Don't use any chemical treatment: Any chemical treatment that changes your hair will also at best weaken it and possibly kill it.
Make simple hair styling: styling that tugs at your hair and on glued-in extensions, tight braids, tight cornrows, and hard gel hairstyles.
Minimize or better still, eliminate heat exposure.
Shampoo only to clean your hair from dirt and old skin cells.
Keep hair moisturized.
Wet your hair thoroughly and apply a palm's sized amount of shampoo (Paul Mitchell, Matrix or Motions suggested) on the each side of the head and lather well.
Gently comb out your hair with a wide tooth comb or what most people know as afro comb.
'Co-wash'.
For best results, simply rinse the hair well with warm water, and apply conditioner to the hair, starting about 2 inches (5.1Â cm) away from the scalp, and smooth it through to the ends.
For after-wash care, Begin with towel drying (Pat your hair dry - don't rub, it causes hair to frizz).
Maintenance: Every night, before bed, oil your scalp, brush you hair and wrap it.

Gather together pieces of wood approximately 8 inches / 20.3 cm in length.
Find a piece that you would like to use as your "starter" piece.
Cut your "starter" piece using a band saw.
Cut or find another piece of wood.
Using wood glue, glue the three pieces of wood back together again by sandwiching your new piece between the two cut pieces.
Continue to make random cuts in your block.
Cut the block down to a more "finished" size.
Determine which end will be your "pen" end.
Do not remove the drill bit as now it will be your "poor man's lathe"!,
Remove the bit from the block and use a Dremel tool to round the end to accept the pen insert you have chosen.
Admire your handiwork - you will have a most original pen that can never be duplicated!

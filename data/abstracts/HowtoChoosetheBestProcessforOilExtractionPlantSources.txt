Examine the characteristics of the source for the oil.
Target a particular set of end products:


Common edible oil
Senior edible oil
Special grease products
Industrial oils
Other classes analogous to petrochemicals

,
Realize that the process design is highly dependent on the targeted output oil grade.
Specify the pre-treatment process.
Consider carefully the process elements for your targeted input and output.
Consider the entire oil processing stream - procurement to packaging and distribution as well as each of the side streams:


The by-products
The waste created (disposal/re-use)

,
Provision for unique characteristics of the seed variety and the oil extract.
Choose special oil making processes in order to keep original oil flavor and preferred characteristics of the oil.
Eliminate waste.
Build into the design the appropriate temperature monitoring and control.

,
Perform an initial "economy of scale" analysis.

,
Provision for quality analysis.
Perform selection review.
Realize that the process of selecting and configuring equipment is iterative.
Test a prototypical process implementation.
Analyze scalability and flexibility.

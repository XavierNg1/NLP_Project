Make the sugar wax.
Remove pot from heat and leave to cool.
Transfer the wax into the jar or container.
Test a small amount of the wax on your skin to see if you have an allergic reaction or sensitivity.
Wash your legs in warm water to relax the hairs.
Check your legs to see in which direction your hair is growing.
Test the temperature of the wax by applying a little to your hand.
Apply a thin layer to your legs with the spatula in the direction of your hair growth.
Apply the strip of cloth and rub/massage the strip on to the wax covered part of your leg.
Grab the strip by the end piece and then pull the strip away in the opposite direction of hair growth.
Repeat until your entire leg is hair free.
Wash your legs with cold water, never with hot or warm water.

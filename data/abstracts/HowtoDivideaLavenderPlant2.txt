Begin in spring or summer.
Select a branch with at least two leafy nodes.
Acquire a root stimulator (sometimes optional).
Prepare small pots or a starting tray of special soil.
Cut the branch with a sharp, clean knife.
Cut off all but the top cluster of leaves.
Dip the base of the cutting in a root stimulator (sometimes optional).
Plant the cuttings in the prepared containers, and water thoroughly.
Keep damp and shaded, but gradually expose to less water and more sun.
Transplant into a larger pot or the ground once roots develop.

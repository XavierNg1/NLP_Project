Establish a relationship.
Compliment her.
Start a ball game.
Chat with her.
Just be yourself.
Move in closer.
Ask.
Be confident, but not cocky.
Be perceptive.
If she says no.
If she says "I'll think about it", it's not a good sign, although she could just be nervous, or caught up in the moment, and she's being careful not to make a stupid mistake.
Don't ask her out as a dare or as a joke.
This is the most important rule.

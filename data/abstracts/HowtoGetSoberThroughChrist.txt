Accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior to acknowledge God in all you do or think, before you can be set free.
Receive God's provision and power over sin!,
Put on the whole armor of God (the helmet of salvation, the breastplate of righteousness in Christ, the sword of the Word, the belt of faith, and feet prepared to God's will).
Rid your life of the influences of unruly people, those who deny your right to believe and live in New Life in Christ Jesus -- How?,
Avoid making provision for the "old-man/man of sin"; so, avoid places that would cause you to hate, live riotously, to be lustful outside of true love, nor otherwise to doubt God and/or to fall/slide back into allowing degrading sins of excess and self-centered life to rule.

,
Allow the word of Christ, God's word of the Gospel, as found in The Bible, to reign in your life.

,
Read the Bible regularly.
Be in a spirit of prayer continually.
Acknowledge the Lord in all your ways, by God's Holy Spirit.
Show His love, kindness, truth, including faith, hope, and charity and think on.
Talk to the pastor of your church, or a deacon/elder, if they can help you talk through some of your issues.
Check around for a good meeting place or church.
Persist.

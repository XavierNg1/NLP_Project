Cut off any curled and distorted leaves and flowers on the rose bush with sharp hand pruners and discard them.Aphids may be hiding within them and it is not worth saving them as they will not recover.
Use a garden hose with a spray nozzle to spray the aphids off the roses in the morning.
Repeat this treatment several times a week if the aphids return.

Get a t-shirt.
Wash and dry the shirt.
Get some rhinestones.
Place your rhinestones where you want them to go.
Make a small puddle of glue on a lid or disposable tray.
Use a chopstick or popsicle stick to apply some of the glue to the back of a rhinestone.
Put the rhinestone back into place, and press down on it gently.
Keep gluing the rhinestones on until you are done, then wait for the glue to dry completely.
Wear your new shirt.

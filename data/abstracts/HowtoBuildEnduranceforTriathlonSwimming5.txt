This is not really an endurance training session, for less-than reasonably well-trained and experienced swimmers.

,
The intensity is hard.
To improve the duration of the swim training, you can sustain above your race pace, you need to be able to swim at a faster pace, and have short rest intervals, to allow you to complete a greater total distance than you would otherwise be able to at this pace.
This is a VERY HARD session that you need to be technically very competent, to get the most out of.
The early part of the session will feel OK, because you are swimming quite a short distance, and having with a good rest.

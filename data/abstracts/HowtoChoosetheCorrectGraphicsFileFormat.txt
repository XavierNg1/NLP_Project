Use BMP to print graphics such as logos or icons.
Use TIF for scanned images and photographs.
Use GIF for line drawings and pictures, drawings with large areas of solid color and animations.
Use JPG for photographic images and images with subtle color gradations.
Use PNG for any type of Web graphic except animations.
However, .png sequences can be exported from many applications such as Maya or 3D Studio Max and are excellent for use in film and animations when used in software such as Adobe Premiere or After Effects.

Use .eps (photoshop or illustrator) for logos or graphics you wish to import into programmes such as InDesign.

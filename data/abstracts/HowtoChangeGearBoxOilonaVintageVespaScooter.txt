Do this after the engine has been run and is still warm, but avoid doing it directly after the scooter has been run and when it is still very warm or even hot.
Find the bolt.
Once located, place some sort of drain pan under the bolt.
Let it drain completely.Once the oil has completely drained, place the drain bolt back on the bottom of the case and be sure to use a new gasket if you have one here too.
To fill, go back up to the fill screw on the side of the case.
Now, let the oil drain out the fill hole for a good half hour to an hour.
Kick it over and go for a ride because, you just changed you own gear box oil!#

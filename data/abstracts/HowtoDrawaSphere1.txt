Gather the materials you need to draw the sphere.
Trace your circular object on the paper.
Choose where your light source will be.
Fill the sphere with very light shading.Avoid pressing too hard with your pencil while you shade, as this is your first layer of shading.
Smooth the shading with a cotton ball or tissue.
Add more shading to areas of the sphere that the light source minimally reaches.Gently shade again around most of the circle, making darker shading on the sides of the sphere where the light source cannot reach.
Repeat smoothing out the shading with a cotton ball or tissue.
Darken the outer edges of the sphere, particularly on the bottom and opposite side of the light source.The light source cannot reach these areas, so naturally, they should be darker.
Smooth the darkened shading again.Maintaining a smooth-looking sphere is important in order to help it look realistic.
Make the crescent edge opposite the light source the darkest.This is the final shading step, creating the core shadow.
Rub your cotton ball or tissue over the dark crescent at the bottom to smooth it one last time.This will help to blend the core shadow into the rest of the sphere.

Clean up the edges of the sphere by erasing any smudges that escaped the edges.

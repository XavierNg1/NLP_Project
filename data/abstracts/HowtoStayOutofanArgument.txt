Ask yourself these 4 questions: Is the matter important enough to warrant an argument?,
If you often argue with a person, plan and practice staying calm.
Learn to recognize when a discussion is no longer a discussion, but is escalating to an argument: Raised voices, flushed face or neck, hairs on the back of your neck stand up, feeling defensive.
Identify your "buttons".
Know that others know where to find your buttons.
Say these words in the calmest tone of voice you can muster: "I love", "I care about", or "I respect" you too much to argue with you.",
Prepare yourself for weird looks (the same ones they usually give you behind your back) and another attempt to keep the arguing going... like "That's not true!",
Repeat step 4.

,
Try not to listen too much to the content of what they're saying back to you.
Continue repeating step 4 until the other person walks away or shuts up.

,
If warranted, when both of you ARE calm, ask if this is a good time to finish your discussion.

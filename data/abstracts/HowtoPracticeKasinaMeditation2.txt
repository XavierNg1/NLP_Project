Position your disc in a place you can sit and see it comfortably without developing any discomfort in the neck, shoulders etc.
Observe the characteristic of your disc, such as repeating mentally "water, water" or "space, space" etc.
Gaze gently at the disc and relax into it, as strong, rigid focus can create strain which can be a hindrance.
Find yourself a quiet place with minimal disturbances if where you are is no longer suitable.
Keep observing the new image and noting the characteristic.

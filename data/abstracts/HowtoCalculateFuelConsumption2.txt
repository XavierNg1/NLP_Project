Remember that fuel consumption changes based on your driving.
Record multiple tanks of gas in a row to find your average fuel consumption.
Set your trip odometer to zero with a full tank of gas.
Record how many gallons of gas you purchase each time you fill up.
Drive for normally for several weeks.
Fill up your tank fully after 2-3 weeks.
Add up the number of gallons you bought.
Divide total miles by total gallons.
Know that your car's advertised mileage is often overestimated.

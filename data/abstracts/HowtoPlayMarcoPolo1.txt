Choose one person to be "Marco.",
Have Marco count to ten before searching for anybody.
Have Marco shout "Marco" while everyone else answers by shouting "Polo.",
Marco should follow the sounds of the other people and try to tag them.
The Polos should move away from Marco to avoid being caught.
When Marco tags somebody, he or she will become the new Marco and the game will start over.

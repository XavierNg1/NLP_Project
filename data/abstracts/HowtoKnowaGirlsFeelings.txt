Notice the size of her pupils.
Count how many times she blinks in a minute.
Listen to the tone of her voice.

Ask her to do an activity where you can concentrate on her.
Listen actively to what she says to you.
Ask her how she feels about you or a situation where you are worried about her feelings.

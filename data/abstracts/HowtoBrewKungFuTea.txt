Put together a suitable tea set.
Prepare the tea leaves in advance, so that they are ready to be placed in the pot as soon as it has been warmed.
Rinse all vessels with hot water.
Before infusion, pour hot water over the leaves and then quickly pour it off.
Use pure or mineral water to brew the tea.
Fill the teapot to the top with hot water and cover.
Pour the water into the fair cup to heat it.
Add tea leaves and let steep.
When the leaves have infused their essence, pour the tea out into the pitcher (fair cup).
From the fair cup, distribute the tea in the aroma cups, keeping the pitcher close to the cups and pouring slowly.
After the aroma cups are filled, position one tasting cup, upside down, over each aroma cup.
At this point, the aroma cup can be brought near the nose to receive the fragrance of the tea by inhaling the steam.

After smelling, drink the tea from the tasting cups.

Take out the shoe laces and cover the rubber parts with masking tape.
Come up with a design, and practice it on a sheet of paper or scrap of fabric.
Sketch your design on the shoe using a pencil.
Fill your design in with paint primer if you are using acrylic paint.
Color in your design starting with the largest shapes first.
Wait for the paint to dry before you do the outlines.
Spray the shoe with a shoe sealant or a waterproofing spray.
Remove the masking tape once the sealer dries, and put the laces back in.

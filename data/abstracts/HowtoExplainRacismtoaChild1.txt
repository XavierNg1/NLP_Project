Recognize that children are not color-blind.Unless your child is literally blind, they can see that other people have different skin tones, and may begin making associations if they notice patterns that relate to skin tones.
Expose your child to media involving characters of all races.
Be a good role model.
Explain differences in an accepting, casual manner.
Be truthful about injustice when it happens, and when they learn about it in school.When your child witnesses someone being mean, or something unfair, be honest about the situation instead of trying to cover it up.
Remember that one racist remark doesn't mean your child is 100% racist.

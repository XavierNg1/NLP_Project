Before you pick up the phone, plan out what you're going to say.
Check over your plan and make sure you've included your name, the name of the person you're calling for (if it's a shared line), the reason for calling, the time you called, what time the receiver should call you back (not needed in some messages), and your phone number (if you want them to call you back).
If it helps, say your message out loud before you make the call.
Pick up the phone, take a deep breath, and dial the number.
Be prepared for someone to pick up.
If you get the answering machine, wait for the beep, and then say your message.
Say a proper goodbye or have a good ending to your message.

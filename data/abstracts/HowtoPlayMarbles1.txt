Make a circle on the ground.
Set up your marbles.
Have the first player "knuckle down.",
If the player successfully knocked out another marble (while keeping their shooter in), have them go again.
Shoot from behind the line if a player knocks out your shooter.
Finish the game when all the marbles are gone.

Get a flea comb or tight-toothed comb.
Keep a bucket of water nearby.
Comb out the fleas always in the direction of fur or hair growth.
Take your time.
Repeat this every couple of days.
Be aware that the fleas only hop onto the pet to feed and mostly live in the environment - thus it takes a long time to bring an infestation under control by combing.

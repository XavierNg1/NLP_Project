Develop a good face cleansing routine.
Open your skin pores.
Disinfect your hands or wear gloves.
Sterilize your acne.Prior to using an acne tool, you will want to disinfect the pimples themselves so that bacteria does not inadvertently get pushed further into your pores.
Select the right extracting tool for your acne.Blackheads should be removed with comedone extractors, whereas whiteheads will need to be pierced with a sharp lancet first before removing them with an extractor.
Remove your blackheads with the comedone extractor.You can remove blackheads by centering the loop of the comedone extractor over the pimple you want to remove, and rocking the tool gently from side to side while applying slight pressure.
Remove whiteheads if you are experienced using a lancet.To remove whiteheads, you will need to start by piercing the whitehead with the lancet to break it open.
Treat any bleeding.In some cases, your skin may bleed slightly after using the comedone extractor.
Finish by disinfecting the treated area.To be extra cautious about preventing infection, use additional rubbing alcohol pads to clean your now acne-free skin.

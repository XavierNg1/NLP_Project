During the current holidays, make as detailed a list as possible of everyone you would like to buy a gift for (family, friends, co workers, etc).
Divide the list according to the cost or type (or both) of gift you would like to give.

,
Start shopping for next year the day or week after the holiday.
As you purchase gifts, assign each to a person on your list.
Buy in bulk where possible for groups of people.
Keep an open mind!,
Keep your list and purchased gift items in a central location.
Don't get discouraged!,
In a year or two, you will wonder how you ever did it all at one time!

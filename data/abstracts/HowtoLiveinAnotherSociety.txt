If you intend to live in another place among the borders of your country, you should know the regulations and the habits or the traditions of the society you going to.
if you travelling to another place out the borders “from Manchester to Rome“ here comes the hard work side by side with much more effort.
Try to have friends, new ones in the new society.
Be kind to people.
Be your-self.
Enjoy your new life style “shops and how they buy things, public places and how they deal with each other”


Speak the language not only the mother tongue “Italian” but also how they use it.

,
By using all of that and getting new friends, you are simply one of them now, congratulations!

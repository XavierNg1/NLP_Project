Decide what you want to collect.
Don't trust everything on an online auctioning/shopping website.
Go on a site like Ebay and compare the reviews about the seller with the prices.
See if the seller has other social media accounts.
Look for last-minute deals.
Know when new sets of things are coming out.
If a certain card or figurine is going to go or is out of stock, act fast.
When selling your doubles, see what other people on the site you are selling it on are trying to pay for it.
Know if the item you want to sell is very rare.
Don't bother selling unopened blind boxes.

Plan a ride on Salt Lake City's light rail system, known as TRAX.
Pay for your TRAX tickets online at the Utah Transit Authority website, or find a ticket kiosk located at TRAX stations.
Drive your car to one of the transit's park-and-ride lots and board a TRAX light rail train to get to your destination.
Stay downtown to travel for free on the TRAX light rail.

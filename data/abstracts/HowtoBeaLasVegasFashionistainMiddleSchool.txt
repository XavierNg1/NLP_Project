Review your school dress code carefully: It does not feel good to be dress-coded in a school where you are trying to set the trends.
Look into your closet, drawers, and other places where you keep your clothing: Ideal things you would want to look for would be things appealing to you.
Shopping is an interesting part of a fashionista: Some popular Las Vegas preps would shop at Hollister and A+F.
Be interesting about your clothing choices: Most "preps" would wear layered shirts and a pair of skinny jeans w/ flats.
Have a mixed style in lower wear: Make sure your jeans are good quality.
Footwear does not have to be as varied as the shirt and lower wear, but it is preferred: Examples of classy footwear would be plain flats.
Be careful on accessories: Classy jewelry would include real gold, silver, sterling silver, white gold, and other real materials.
Get a purse: A tote bag is overly common, and tends to repeat itself among people.
Go different on the make-up: One of the most important steps in make-up is to make sure that you are not allergic to it first, so make sure to lightly test it.
Have your hair cut in a trendy style: Most "preps" would have their hair in a poofy rocker style.
Be hygienic: Brush your teeth and gargle mouth wash every morning.
Remove acne from your face by using different products, depending on your skin: Proactive is good, but not recommended for people with gentle skin.
Hang out with whom you want to hang out with: This is for looks, not popularity.

Choose the appropriate solvent.
Dissolve the impure compound: To do so, place that compound in a test tube.

Crystallize the compound of interest.
Collect and wash the crystals: To do this, separate the crystals from the ice-cold solvent by filtration.
Dry the washed product: Final drying for a small amount of crystallized product can be done by squeezing the crystals between sheets of filter paper and allowing them to dry on a watch glass.

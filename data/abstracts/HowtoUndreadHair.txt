Condition your dreads very thoroughly when washing your hair, leaving no dread unconditioned.
Use a strong comb to start combing from the tip of the dread away from your hair.
Continue this process as you go up the dread.
Continue this process around your head, for each dread.
Once you get your hair as well as you can, you'll likely want a wash.

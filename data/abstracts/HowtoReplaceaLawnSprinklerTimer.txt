Determine if you really need to replace your timer.
Write down the existing program on the old controller.
Unplug the transformer from the wall (flat square plug similar to a cell phone charger) or turn off the power to the controller at the breaker.
Disconnect the field wires from the controller and label each one with a piece of tape.
Here is a guide to how to label the wires:


The two most important wires to pay attention to are the COMMON and (if your system is run by a pump without a pressure tank) the PUMP START WIRE.
Replace your timer with the same model and brand as you already have on your system.
Frequently, all the field wires will be a different color.
Unscrew the old controller from the wall and mount the new one.
Re-connect the power wires and turn on the breaker or plug in the transformer.
Note that our system controller should be properly functioning and ready for programming.

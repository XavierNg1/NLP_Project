Gather your supplies.Rolled candles are one of the easiest and fastest types to make, so this is a perfect first project for beginners.
Cut the beeswax and soften it with a hair dryer.Use a straightedge ruler and a craft knife to cut the beeswax sheet into 2 8-inch squares.
Push the wick down onto the wax square and roll.
Seal the candle.After you’ve finished rolling, put pressure on the edge of the wax with your fingers.
Prime the wicks.If you aren’t using pre-primed wicks, you’ll need to prime yours before lighting the candles.
Trim the wicks.Once the wicks are primed, trim both to ¼ inch.

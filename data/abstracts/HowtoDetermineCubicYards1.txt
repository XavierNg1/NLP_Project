Obtain all necessary measurements in yards.
Use the equation L × W × H for rectangular spaces.
For cylindrical spaces, use the equation pi × R2 × H. Finding the volume of a cylindrical space is simply a matter of multiplying the two-dimensional area of one of its circular faces by the height or length of the cylinder.
For spheres, use the equation 4/3 pi × R3.
For cones, use the equation 1/3 pi × R2 × H. The volume of a given cone is 1/3 the volume of a cylinder that has the same height and radius as the cone.
For irregular shapes, try using multiple equations.

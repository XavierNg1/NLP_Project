Find the equation of motion for an object attached to a Hookean spring.
Set up the differential equation for simple harmonic motion.
Rewrite acceleration in terms of position and rearrange terms to set the equation to 0.


mx¨+kx=0{\displaystyle m{\ddot {x}}+kx=0}

Solve for the equation of motion.
Simplify.
Incorporate a velocity-dependent friction force.
Rewrite acceleration and velocity in terms of position and rearrange terms to set the equation to 0.


mx¨+bx˙+kx=0{\displaystyle m{\ddot {x}}+b{\dot {x}}+kx=0}

This is still a second-order linear constant coefficient equation, so we use the usual methods. 


,
Solve for the equation of motion.
Go through the three cases.
Simplify.
Rewrite the solution in terms of the decay time τ{\displaystyle \tau } and damped angular frequency ωd{\displaystyle \omega _{d}}.

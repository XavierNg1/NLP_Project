Read the label to make sure you're buying a meat thermometer and not a candy or oven thermometer.
Buy an instant-read thermometer for meats such as ground beef patties, pork chops or grilled chicken.
Purchase a probe thermometer for meats such as whole birds, ham, beef or lamb roasts.
Use a meat thermometer specially designed for microwave use if you cook meat in the microwave.

Begin Level 32 of the single player campaign, by entering the campaign menu and selecting Level 32.
Read the opening blurb and view the map to gain your bearings.
Move your first worm right under the first ledge and backflip up onto the area just below the first mine.
Get your second worm to place a horizontal girder in the area between the second tower and the third tower, the area with only one mine underfoot.
Move your first worm to the area just above the gap between the first and second towers.
Use your second worm to place a girder as cover over wherever your first worm is, as the enemy worm will begin using his air strikes in the next turn.
Fire punch the enemy worm into the ocean with your first worm, thus winning the level.

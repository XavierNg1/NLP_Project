Combine the sugar, water, and honey in a saucepan over medium heat.
Wait for the sugar to dissolve, then clip the candy thermometer to the side of the pot.
Turn the heat on to high, let the mixture come to a boil, then wait for it to reach the "hard crack" stage.
Take the saucepan off the stove, then stir in your flavorings, if desired.You can leave your honey candy as is, or you can flavor it with some lemon juice.
Pour small drops of honey onto a sheet of parchment paper using a spoon.
Insert lollipop sticks into the drops.
Let the candy harden.

Use squirrel-proof feeders.
Use a squirrel-resistant feeder if you are budget minded.
Use baffles to prevent a squirrel or raccoon from climbing to a feeder.
Buy foods that squirrels do not like.
Mix hot pepper (capsicum) into birdseed.
Try diversion feeding.
Hang some suet in a small suet wire cage several feet from the feeder, in the squirrels' trees.
Consider relocating the squirrels if there isn't much else working.

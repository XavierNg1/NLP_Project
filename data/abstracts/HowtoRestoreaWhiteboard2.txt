Never use abrasive or scratching motions to clean a whiteboard.
Use whiteboard cleaner and a dry towel at the end of every week to keep the board clean.
Remove "ghost marks" or permanent marker by completely covering the board in black dry-erase marker, then erasing it quickly The wet marker actually has chemicals that keep the ink fluid, which will temporarily loosen the ghost marks or permanent marker.
Never use degreasers, soap, or cleaners not specifically formulated for dry-erase boards.
Always dry off a board after wiping it clean with a wet rag.
Clean the dry eraser regularly to prevent build up of dust and marker residue.
Know that restoration will only work so many times before you need a new board.

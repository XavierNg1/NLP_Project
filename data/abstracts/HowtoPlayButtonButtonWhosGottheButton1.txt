Choose a child to be the "IT" or leader for the game round.
Have the children form a circle.
Have the leader go around to each child in the circle.
Start the initial chant before each guess.
Allow one child in the group to guess.
Determine the rounds:

If the guessed name does not have the button, repeat the chant, and have the next child on the left to the previous guesser to choose the potential button holder.

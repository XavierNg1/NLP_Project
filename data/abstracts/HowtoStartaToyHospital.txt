Choose where you're going to have your hospital.
Organise the hospital.
Now it's time for your patients to come in.
Pick your first patient.
Wash the patient first.
Dry your patient with the tea towels.
Give your toy a hospital bracelet.
Inspect your patient.
Show people you mean business.
That's all, so good luck, and good luck being a doctor!

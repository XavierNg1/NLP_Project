Arrange your team into "battle buddies," which are two men or women who will fight together.
This tactic is used for movements, i.e.
The most important step is the cover fire.
The second most important thing in this is timing.
After five seconds if there is no cover, hit the deck even if you are laying in a dip in the ground.
For retreating you do the same thing as in moving forward; the only difference is that you should detour to your partner and tap him on the back to let him know where you are at.

Realize that you're losing your temper with this person.
Breathe deeply and slowly.
Count to 10 in your head.
Be polite and short.
Find a pillow to punch and punch it a few dozen times.
Keep a diary to write in.
Let it go.
Don't linger on the past.
Acknowledge the anxiety and tension that comes with being frustrated and annoyed with other people.
Let go of the need to be in control or to have everything perfect.
Use mindfulness to remain calm.

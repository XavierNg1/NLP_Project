Select a brand, type, and size of paver suitable for your application.
Layout the location the pavers will be set in.
Set the concrete forms, grade and compact the fill material, and place the concrete for the pavers to set in.
Wreck the forms you used to place the concrete for your paver bed.
Fill the paver bed to a suitable depth for laying the pavers.
Level the setting bed, in this case, the sand, with a straight board cut short enough to fit in the setting bed.
Pack the sand (or other non-cementious material with your leveling board by tapping it flatly with the widest side of the board.
Re-level the sand after packing it, by pulling the board over the surface lightly.
Stock pavers around the area you are working in.
Lay the pavers in the pattern you choose, or as specified by the designer/architect.
Tap the pavers down with the edge of a short 2X4 board or a soft rubber mallet to seat them firmly in the setting bed.
Realign the pavers after the whole area is paved, so that the joint around the perimeter is equal.
Check the flatness of the pavers after the joints are aligned and all the pavers are laid in.
Scatter loose, dry sand to fill the joints, or the cracks between the pavers.
Clean the pavers after you have finished filling the joints, leaving a little of the surplus sand for refilling any areas that may settle.

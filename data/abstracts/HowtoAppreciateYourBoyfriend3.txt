Listen to your partner.This may seem common sensical, but when your boyfriend is telling you about his day, about something that is bothering him, or even something that recently made him happy, listen to what he is telling you.Stop what youâ€™re doing, put away any distractions (such as a cell phone) and be involved in the conversation.
Do something unexpected.
Support him in his hobbies and passions.There are likely things that your boyfriend feels passionate about.
Go on dates.When you first met your boyfriend, you likely went out on at least a few dates to get to know each other.
Look nice for your boyfriend.
Be affectionate.

Don't leave your preparation to the last minute!,
Beware of the scams of those UMAT Prep Courses.
Take a speed reading course as part of your UMAT preparation, particularly for sections 1 and 2.
Be organised!,
Make sure you organise to get to your designated testing centre by the designated reporting time on your admission ticket.
Time management is key!,
Utilise your nervous energy.
Have confidence in your abilities.
Be careful if you are trying to think like the test writer or assuming they are trying to trick you (even if they are).

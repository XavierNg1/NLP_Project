Create a Steam account, install Steam (for free), and buy Portal.
Download Portal: Prelude.
Unzip the file.
Open Finder and find /Users/<yourmacosxuser>/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/<yoursteamusername>/portal.
Right-click the portal folder and select "Duplicate".
In the original portal folder, you will see another folder inside it, also labeled "portal".
Open the portal prelude folder that popped up when you unzipped the file earlier.
Launch Steam.
If you want to switch back to playing regular Portal, simply go back to Finder and change the "portal" folder to "portal copy" and vice versa.

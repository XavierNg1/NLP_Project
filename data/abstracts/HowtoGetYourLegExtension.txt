Believe in yourself and believe you can do it.
Develop the ability to do the splits.
Maintain some flexibility.
Start on your splits stretches.
Lunge.
If you feel you are close enough to your splits, it's time to work on your leg extension.
If you can lift your leg head high with furniture holding it, you need to work on your leg muscles so that you can hold it there without furniture assisting you.
Do lunges and more lunges.

Get a spot.
Stand tall.
Start with your lead (good, dominate, etc.),
Lift your back leg off the ground, straightening your standing leg as you do so.
Balance in a handstand.
Lean to your dominate side, lifting your "bad" arm off the ground.
Hold for as long as possible.
Once you bring your other arm down, splits your legs.
Start coming down, while changing your legs from split, to straight legs.
Land, and finish with your arms next to your ears.

State Pascal's Wager.
Consider that if B & ~G (you believe in God and he does not exist), you actually do lose something.
Consider the possibility that God exists, but you have chosen the incorrect God.
Consider the possibility that God exists, but God is the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
Consider the possibility that God truly is all-loving and that our wagerer has led a good life.
Finally, consider the case of a similar God to that described by event L, except that this God despises those that accept Pascal's Wager, considering it demeaning to him.
Realize that one can add infinitely many possible categories of God.

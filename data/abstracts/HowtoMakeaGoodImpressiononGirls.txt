Compliment her, but don't overdo it.
Respect her.
Take it slow.Find out what she's interested in (but seriously, not like a stalker)

,
People like it when someone is sincerely interested in what they think and say.
If you really like a woman and you think she likes you as well, go ahead and ask her out but remember, if she says no it's not the end of the world!

,
If she says yes try to think of something unique and creative to do, but try to make it something that's in public, preferably during the day or on a weekend.
Really, just be yourself.

,
Don't brag, girls hate that.
It's good to agree with her on things, but if every time she asks your opinion on something you just nod or say "sure", she will either not think you're listening or that you don't care, which you might not, but you don't want to give her that impression.

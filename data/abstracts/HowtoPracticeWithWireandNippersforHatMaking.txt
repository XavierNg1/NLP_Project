Familiarize yourself with the wire shapes:



Support brim wires: Support wires on brim include center wire from back to front, support wires from side to side, and diagonal support wires left side and diagonal support wires right side.
Practice until you can turn one wire over another securely and silk on wire is not damaged and no point is felt where wire is cut off.
Practice using tie wire.

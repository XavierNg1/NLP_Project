Soften the beans.
After the beans are softened, place them aside and get another pot.
After the onions have cooked well in the oil, drop the garlic and begin to stir.
Once everything has mixed, add the salt, oregano, and the powder seasoning.
Drop in a celery stick or two, add the parsley stems with leaves, and add half of a bell pepper.
(optional) If you find that your beans are too watery, chop thickly a plantain and pour it in.
Let it boil on low-medium fire for about 15-20 mins.

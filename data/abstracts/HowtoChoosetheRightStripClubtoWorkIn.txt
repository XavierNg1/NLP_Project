Before you decide to work in a club, Google your area and look at the websites of the clubs in the area you want to work.
Once you have a shortlist of clubs, rope a male friend if possible (lucky him!),
When you are at the club.
Talk to the girls and ask them if they like working in the club and if they have been working there long.
Find out what the audition process is and go for an audition to get a real good feel for the place.
If you are already working in a club, before you jump ship, visit another club and work there for one night.

Purchase the correct rice.
Measure out the rice.
Next, rinse and soak the rice.
To boil, you'll need 100 milliliters of cold water for every 100 grams of rice - that is, the weight of the rice before you let it soak, which in this example would mean 600 milliliters (20.3 fl.oz.),
Watch over the pot until it starts to boil.
After the seven minutes have passed, you should turn the heat down from max power to just enough power to let the rice simmer for an additional fifteen minutes.
Optional: Let the rice cool down if you don't want it to get too sticky while you season it.
Make the su.
Mix the su and rice.
If you must refrigerate, then reheat by gently steaming or microwaving with a piece of lettuce leaf or cling wrap lightly covering the rice (so that it does not dry out) until the texture returns to that of soft, freshly cooked rice.
Preheat the oven to 375F.
Put the rinsed and soaked rice into an 8x8 Pyrex dish.








,
Pour the same amount of already boiling water into the dish.

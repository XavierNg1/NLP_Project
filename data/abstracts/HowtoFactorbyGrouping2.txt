Look at the equation.
Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF).
Create smaller groups within the problem.
Factor out the GCF from each binomial.
Factor out the common binomial.
Write your answer.
Factor: 6x2 + 2xy - 24x - 8y


22222(3x + y)(x â€“ 4)

,
Factor: x3 - 2x2 + 5x - 10


(x3 - 2x2) + (5x - 10)
x2(x - 2) + 5(x - 2)
(x - 2)(x2 + 5)

Cut a rectangle of 140 lb.
Draw a simple house starting with a square 3½ in (10cm) on a side, in pencil to represent the body of the house.
Alternatively, trace a miniature wooden birdhouse purchased from the craft or discount store.
Repeat drawing houses until you have four in a row.
Add details to each house such as entry holes for the birds, a picket fence, shingles, siding, or anything you wish.
Embellish the houses with vines, flowers, leafs, beds, berries, tree branches, etc.
Put a bird or two in the picture.
Prepare your watercolors by adding water to each pad if you are using pan paints.Set out brushes, a ½" (1cm) flat for big areas, and some pointed ones in various sizes.
Begin painting by pulling a color for the body of the house, diluting it with clear water and making a puddle large enough to cover the area you wish to fill.
When dry, paint the greenery, flowers, birds, sun and any other touches you can think of.

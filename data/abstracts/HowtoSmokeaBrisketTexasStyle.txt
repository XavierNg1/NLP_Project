Purchase a 12+ pound brisket.
The night before fill a container with enough water to just cover the brisket.
Start the smoker about 1 hour before you are ready to start smoking the brisket using a wood of your choice.
Place the brisket fat side up on the smoker for about 1 hour per pound.
Add a sauce of your choice and serve.

Use a fine-toothed louse comb to help identify living head lice.
Look for nits (head louse eggs) at the base of the hair shaft using the same technique.
Use a magnifying glass to make identification of head lice easier.
If you find lice or nits, be sure to treat the person showing signs of head lice.

Try to figure out why your parents don't want you to get contacts.
If you can convince just one parent, do that instead.
Save up your own money.
Stretch the truth about your age.
Do some research.
Schedule your appointment accordingly.
Don't get 'over-sold'.
Take good care of your lenses so you have no problems.
Hide your contacts somewhere even the nosiest of parents would not find them.

Decide on the basics, are you a Pok√©mon or human?,
Once you have the basics done design your character!,
Think about the setting.
Create a history.
Decide what you want to do.
Create a story.
Once you finish the main parts and get to the ending have a think about it.
Are you having an epilogue?,
Give your manga to a friend or family member that will be able to read it, it's no use giving it to a baby!

If they agree that it's OK, you've finished!

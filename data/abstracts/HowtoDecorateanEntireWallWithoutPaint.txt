Find out exactly how far it is from the ceiling to the floor of the wall you want to cover, and how wide side to side.
Browse your local fabric stores or online and find a pattern of fabric that you like.
Remember that while this is easier to put up than paint, it's more expensive and you won't be changing it very often.
Figure out how wide the fabric is.
Buy the fabric in one length or the lengths of the individual pieces you will need (width of the wall + a few inches).
Buy a spool of upholstery thread that matches your fabric, and a needle for your sewing machine that will handle the thickness of what you're sewing.

,
Pin the pieces together lengthwise so that you can sew them into one large panel.
Trim the end you didn't line up so it's mostly even.

,
Hem the bottom, and both sides.
Buy screws.
Lay the fabric out so that you can access the entire top edge.
Hold the boards up at the top of your wall, against the other walls and the ceiling.
Drill a hole through the front of the fabric, the board, and into the wall for the screw.
Add those nuts to the bottom hem if the fabric doesn't hang straight enough.
Tack the fabric to the wall down the sides in a few places if needed.
Enjoy your awesome wall!

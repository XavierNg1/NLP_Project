Warm up before playing.
Start by warming up in-game by just hitting the ball with the bat slow then moderate then fairly fast.
Practice.
Know that the loop drive is the primary attacking stroke of serious players today.
Understand that depending on the characteristic of the incoming ball, the loop must be modified to hit the ball correctly.
Forehand Loop: From the ready position, bring the right foot slightly back (while transferring your weight to it).
Backhand Loop: This time, the backswing goes in front of your legs, and to do so you should drop your right shoulder somewhat.
Notes on the loop: Since a lot of paddle speed is required in this stroke, the extra backswing, bending of the knees, and the usual waist rotation and weight transfer are all needed, not to mention the wrist snap at contact.
Forehand Drive: Keep the upper arm close, but not flush, to the torso.
Backhand Drive: From the ready position, the waist turns left with the racket pointing towards the 9 o'clock position.
These are the advanced and basic terms of ping pong.

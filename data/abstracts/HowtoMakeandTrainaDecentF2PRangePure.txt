After you have your pesos, buy the leather set of ranging armor, comprised of the following: Leather vambs, cowl, boots, body, and chaps.
Get some herring or sardines, and now you train at Edgevillain Men or Monks until 30 Ranged.
With your 30 Range, actually keep training on Monks until 40 Ranged.
With your 40 Ranged you may train at the following: Monks, Cows, Minotaurs, Wizards at Varrock(7), or even Wizards(13).
At 50 Ranged, you should go to the Hill Giants, and earn some monies!,
At 70 Range or 65, you can go to Flesh Crawlers until 75/80, which will be quite a bore.
At 75/80, you may travel to the infamous Lesser Demon at Karamja Volcano.

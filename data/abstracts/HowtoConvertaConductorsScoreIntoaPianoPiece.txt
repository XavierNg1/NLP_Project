Possess some prior musical knowledge.
Acquire a copy of the conductor's score for the piece you wish to "piano-iffy".
Listen to a recording of the piece being performed to get a feel of which instruments have the melody, which have important lower parts, which have solos, etc.
Transpose everything to concert pitch, which is the key of C (see related wikiHows for help).
Figure out the melody parts.
Write the bass part.
Play through what you've written.
After making those tweaks, play through it again.

Decide what to draw.
Draw the character one square at a time on a sheet of graph paper.
Color the image (again square by square).
Scan the image in your computer.
Outline the objects and / or character.
Delete the template (original drawing).
Prevent body parts from meshing with other body parts, such as the hand with the face if you plan to do a jumping animation (see Mario).
Save the work.

Listen to him or her when they talk.
Forgive them if they get arrested sometimes.
Don't let them stash stuff in your house or do favors for them that can get you in trouble with the law.
Be ready to hang out with people you may not like.
Try to have fun with your gangster.
Try to wear cool clothes and designer styles to impress your mate.
Never ever cheat on your gangster!,
Get into the music your gangster loves.
Don't blame yourself if the gangster breaks it off.

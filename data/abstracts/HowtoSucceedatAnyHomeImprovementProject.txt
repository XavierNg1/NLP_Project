Research your project on the internet and in the library and bookstore.
Before starting any large project, call the local building department and talk with an inspector.
Draw your project to scale on ¼-in.
Keep the construction details as simple as possible to avoid mistakes and unanticipated problems.
Buy or rent all the tools you need – it’s counterproductive to attempt a major project with second-rate equipment.
Get all the materials you need before starting your job to avoid time-wasting trips to the home center - and arrange for deliveries when possible.
Find sources for good advice at the local hardware store or lumberyard.
Investigate local lumberyards and suppliers that cater to contractors.
Make a list of everything you're doing and work out the sequence of steps.
If you have to remove the only toilet in your house to re-tile, plan your work so you can reinstall it temporarily at the end of each day – all you need is a fresh wax ring and a few shims.
If possible, break your job down into small sections and finish each one before moving on.
If you’re following a guide or how-to book, detailed how-to instructions may not be completely clear on the first or second reading, but they'll start to make sense when you get more involved in the job.

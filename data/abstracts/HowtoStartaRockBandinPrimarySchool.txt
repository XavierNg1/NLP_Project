Get people to join.
Get a name and a logo.
Get a place to practice.
Have a jam of some of your favourite songs.
Write your music.
Practice the music you wrote.
Tell people about your band.
Record a demo.
Once you are sure you really are a good, strong band then save up some money to hire a nearby hall int own for a night.
Have fun, stay serious about your band, and you can stay in your band for as long as you like and maybe, just maybe, you may be launching a new CD in a year or two......

Make sure that the drill is disconnected from any power source.

Remove the clamp that secures the power cord to the drill motor housing (this is a stress relief clamp that protects the internal connection).

,
Pull the cord out of the drill housing, and remove the factor boot, or cord protector from it.
Find a replacement power cord for the drill.
Strip the insulation jacket off of about 3 to 5 inches (7.5-12.5cm) of the replacement cord, then strip the conductor insulation back about 3/4 inch (2cm), being careful not to nick or damage the wire strands.

,Slide the cord boot onto the new cord, letting it slip down several inches from the stripped insulation jacket.
Insert the wires into the holes (or clamp them onto the terminals) where the old ones were removed, making sure the same colored wires go on the same terminals.
Re-install the cord clamp and tighten it securely, then slip the cord boot into its slot.
Test the drill to make sure it runs.

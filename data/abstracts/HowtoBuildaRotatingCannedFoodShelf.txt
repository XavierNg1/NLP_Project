Decide the size and number of shelves you need.
Cut the plywood on a table saw or with a circular saw.
Using a router and straight edge, rout slots into the sides 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) wide and 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) deep.
Trim the shelves.
Lay one side flat on the ground with the slots facing up.
Drive 2 inch (5.1 cm) screws through the side and into the edge of the shelf.
Turn the unit over and drive screws in this side also.

,
Turn the unit over so the back is facing up.
From the 16x48 scrap plywood, cut 5 pieces 2x32 inch.
With the remaining plywood and/or additional scrap you have laying around, build a base that the casters will attach to.
Decide the configuration of cans that you need.
One problem you may have is the cans getting misaligned when they drop down.
Another problem occurs when the gap is too large for the cans.
Start using the rotating canned food shelf.

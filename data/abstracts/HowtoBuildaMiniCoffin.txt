Know what the objective is.
Cut the 5 ½” wide board to 1 foot (0.3 m) in length.
Next, measure and mark a horizontal line (2 ¾” from top) for the intersection point.
Since the top and bottom need to be identical, attach the boards together before cutting.
Cut the boards to match the outline.
Cut strips of wood to 1 ¾” wide.
Start with the bottom side.
Without touching the angle on the saw, cut two matching pieces for the long sides.
Cut the top side using the same process as above.
Without touching the angle on the saw, cut two matching pieces for the short sides.
Set the saw to 12.5 degrees and cut the remaining angles for the long and short sides.
Do a dry fit of the pieces to make sure everything will go together cleanly.
Sand wood and stain or paint as desired.

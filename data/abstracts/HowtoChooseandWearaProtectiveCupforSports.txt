Always wear a cup in a cup-jockstrap, cup-brief, or cup-sliding short that's designed to hold a cup.
A cup (inside a cup-jockstrap, cup-brief, or cup-sliding short)should be worn without anything underneath (don't wear underwear underneath).
For a cup to work properly, it must fit tightly and firmly against the body.
Step into cup-jockstrap and pull elasticized leg straps up around legs, and the waist-strap firmly around waist with the hard cup at the front of your body and over your genitals.
Insert testicles into bottom and narrower end of cup.

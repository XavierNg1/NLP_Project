Mix a can of tuna into a bowl along with some mayonnaise.
De-core a fresh red apple.
Add a fair amount of diced apple into the tuna and proceed to mix again.
Prep the tortilla.
Lay down a bed of lettuce onto the roll up, allowing the strawberry jam to "glue" it to the wrap.
Top it off with the tuna and fold the wrap.
Finished.

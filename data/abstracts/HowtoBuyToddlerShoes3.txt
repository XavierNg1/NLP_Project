Measure your toddler’s feet correctly.
Put socks on your toddler’s feet when fitting shoes.
Use your little finger to measure the space between your toddler’s Achilles’ tendon and heels and the back of the shoe.
Make sure your toddler’s toes have enough space.
Check that the shoe isn’t too wide or too narrow.
Ask your child how the shoe feels on their feet.

Remain calm.
Be polite.
Start by offering help on his part.
Calmly explain to him your feelings.
If you have a boyfriend, say so, in a NICE way so it won't hurt him.
Wait for his response.
If he seems really upset and might cry, tell him sorry and get to class.
If he is or may become violent, walk away quickly and tell a trusted adult.

Look at the gecko's tail.
The gecko should also have no signs of disease, and have clear eyes, mouth and nose.

,
If you take a look at the face, it should have no "goop" around or on the eyes, and no scratch, burn or bite marks should be seen, and the jaw should properly close.

,
The gecko should have all toes.
The body should be in-line and smooth with no large lumps.
Take a look at the eyes.
If there is feces in the cage, look at those.
Ask the seller to let you see the gecko.

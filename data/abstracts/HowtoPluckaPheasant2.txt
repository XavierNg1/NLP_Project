Soak the birds quickly in hot water to make plucking much faster and easier.
Set a large pot of water on the stove until it reaches roughly 140–150 °F (60–66 °C).
Holding it by the neck, dunk the body of the pheasant into the scalding water for 30 seconds.
Remove the bird, draining over the pot until water no longer streams down the sides.
Dunk and drain the bird two more times so it "cooks" for 90 seconds total.
Quickly pluck the pheasant as if you were doing a normal dry pluck.
Heat and pluck only one pheasant at a time.

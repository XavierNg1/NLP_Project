Never feed a dingo.
Make the campsite unattractive to dingoes, especially when you're not around.
Leave dingoes alone.
Place all shoes and other small objects away at night, either inside your tent or rig, or in your car.
Keep all bait for fishing locked away in odor-proof containers or inside the car.
Enjoy a campfire at night if permitted.

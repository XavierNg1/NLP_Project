Have a nice, quiet place to work.
Keep your goals in sight.
With respect to goals, it is necessary to set goals that are within your reach and that you can accomplish.
Know what is driving you.
Set your work schedule and hours.
If you do not learn to deal with all of them, including the distractions and procrastination issues, you will never meet your goals and succeed.

Diversify.
Plan ahead.
After writing down what you want, check to make sure you don't already have a lot of these already.
When buying clothes, think about what you already have, and how what you're thinking of buying will work with the clothes already in your wardrobe.
Spend Sensibly


Worst thing about being a teen?,
Spend smart.
Consider changing your basics.
When shopping, you don't have to buy immediately.
Take your time.
Wait.
Give the Finger to Trends.
Don't think just because everyone else is wearing it, you have to buy it now!,
It's better to create your own style than to follow what someone else's.

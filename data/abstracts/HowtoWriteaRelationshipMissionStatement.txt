Listen to your heart.
Don't settle.
Be prepared to make changes.
When you see happy couples, feel free to ask questions.
Think in terms of principles and qualities, rather than specifics.
When you've pondered all these points, start writing.
Store your mission statement in its own file on your computer.
Print out the mission statement and put it in a place where you'll see it often.
As you learn more about yourself and more about potential partners, don't hesitate to do a few "course corrections" and revise your mission statement.
Prepare yourself to live that new life.
Have fun.

Obtain a soprano saxophone to practice on.
Check the case for the following: Clean out rag on a weighted cord, cork grease, mouthpiece and ligature, and possibly a polishing cloth.
Check to be certain the instrument is in good working condition.
If purchasing, shop around online.
Practice the new fingering.
You will need to practice playing the saxophone, especially the upper register notes, to get used to the fingering when your eye falls on each note in the music.
Your lower lip may be sore for a few days with the new mouthpiece and reed on the saxophone.
Enjoy the versatility of the saxophone!

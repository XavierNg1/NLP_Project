Disappear for a while on the night of the full moon.
Be very protective of the ones you love.
Walk like a wolf.
Practice three different stares.
Target someone who loves wolves or is very connected with animals.
After a full moon night, put some dirt and leaves on your clothes and hair.
At places with many people, move as if you're hunting.
When you sleep, sleep in wolf positions.
Hang out with canines more than with people.
Comment on smells.
If someone accuses you of being a werewolf, deny it quickly.
If you are a boy, let your hair grow so it looks like you are quite furry.

 If you're a right-handed golfer, move your grip over to the left a bit. Make sure your knuckles on your left hand aren't visible on your grip, but your right-hand knuckles are. Don't overdo this. A fade can easily turn into a slice if you move your grip too much to the left.Make sure your left hand is on top of your right hand for as long as possible. Hold your club face square to your release path, or even open to it.
 A fade is where the ball starts off left and slowly drifts back to center. To make sure your fade doesn't become a slice, aim slightly left of target with your feet and shoulders.
 On impact, hit the ball so that the toe of the club is tilted slightly rearward and the heel is in front of the toe.This will promote the left-to-right movement that you're looking for with a fade.
 Swinging really hard with an open swing encourages a slice. So don't kill the ball. Swing evenly so that your hands don't turn over., A lower height on the teed-up ball will help you swing more level at impact.

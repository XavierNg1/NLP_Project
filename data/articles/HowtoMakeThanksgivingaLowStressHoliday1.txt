 You can roast your turkey at no more than 250 °F (121 °C). It will take approximately 6-8 hours for a 30-pound bird. Season your bird and prepare it for roasting as usual. Use a meat thermometer and stick it into the thickest part of the thigh of the turkey, avoiding touching the bone. Begin basting your turkey after 4 hours, every 30-45 minutes. Brush on a mixture of seasonings, oil and honey 30 minutes to an hour before it is supposed to be served and turn up the heat for the last half hour to 350 °F (177 °C). Keep an eye on the browning level of your bird during that time so that the sugar in the honey doesn't turn black.;
, Use store-bought stuffing mixes and cranberry sauce to cut down on distracting side dishes. Buy frozen pie instead of making your own. If you enjoy candied yams, make them ahead of time and keep them covered in the refrigerator for a day or two. You could also make them a week or two ahead and freeze the finished yams.
 Speak to family members ahead of time to make sure they know their part in preparing for the Thanksgiving meal. One could be in charge of basting and making the stuffing, one for gravy/cranberry sauce etc., one or two for setting the table, one to help carve the bird or take care of desserts. Don't assume that as the host or hostess, you have to single-handedly prepare everything for a party of 10 or 20.

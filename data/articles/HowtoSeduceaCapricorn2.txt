 Capricorn is an earth sign. The Capricorn people cannot survive in a fickle environment. So if you are a person who is prone to making impulsive and/or irrational decisions, either change yourself or give up, because the Capricorns won't change in this aspect.
 Capricorns will not respect you unless they see that you have a steady source of income.
 If you have planned a date with him or her at 8 o' clock on Monday, then you better be there. Not appearing in case of emergencies once or twice is fine, but more than that will be a warning signal telling them not to trust you.
 Actions may speak louder than words, but that's not always the case. Capricorns are not the kind of people who will give you another chance if you get caught lying. So, in simple words, don't.

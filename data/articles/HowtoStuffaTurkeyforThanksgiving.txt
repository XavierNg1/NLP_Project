 Look it over for any small pinfeathers that may have been left behind when the turkey was plucked, and remove them.






;
, Under your turkey's tail, you will see an empty cavity. You'll eventually stuff this cavity with stuffing.









Remove the giblets (they are most likely inside of a paper package). The neck may also be inside the cavity; remove it as well.
Set the giblets in a dish or resealable plastic bag and refrigerate them if you plan to make giblet gravy later. Otherwise, just discard them.
 You can also put a platter on the bottom of the sink to help support the turkey while you rinse it.









Run some cool water over the outside of the turkey.
Turn the turkey over and rinse out the cavity that you just emptied. Sometimes, the juices leak out of the giblet package and pool in the cavity. You don't want your stuffing to look bloody.
Take your turkey out of the sink and put it on a work surface. Blot it dry with paper towels.
 Make sure to cover both the outside of the turkey and the cavity with your seasonings.
 Make sure that your stuffing uses only cooked ingredients including cooked vegetables, meat and seafood. If you use eggs, then you'll need to use pasteurized eggs.
 Position your oven rack so that you can fit your stuffed turkey into the oven after it's prepared.
 Fold the neck flap down, and lift the wings up and over the closed flap. The wings will hold the flap in place without requiring trussing.
 Make sure that you don't pack stuffing into the cavity because it may not cook completely.
, Stick a meat thermometer into the thickest part of your turkey breast.
 The stuffing inside should be 165 F (74 C).
 Place a tent of aluminum foil over the bird and allow it to rest for 20 minutes.
, Carve it and serve it with the dish of stuffing.

 Center your index, middle and ring finger on top of the ball. You'll be moving your pinkie finger and thumb after you get those three fingers positioned correctly.

, This will help you get a firm grip on the ball in the palm of your hand. Some pitchers choose to touch their index fingers and thumbs slightly to get a better feel for the ball.
 This will add more friction to the ball. While when you throw a fastball, you'll be pushing the ball with your fingers, making a whipping motion, you won't have that with the changeup. Instead, you'll be using your palm to do most of the work, leaving your fingers limp and avoiding that whipping action.









Grip the ball deep in the base of your fingers and then turn it over and inward when you release it.
 Once you've positioned the ball correctly, you should throw the ball to your batter, following the same technique you'd use for other pitches: lift your arms and elbows over your head, move them forward, toward the shoulder of the pitching arm, move your throwing arm above and behind you, bend your knees, and throw the ball with the knee on the opposite foot bend while the leg on the side of the throwing arm lifts up as you follow through and cross your throwing arm over your body as you finish off the pitch.








Move your pitching arm as quickly as you'd move it while throwing a fastball. The beauty is that it will look like the ball will be coming just as quickly as a fastball while actually traveling 10% slower. This is guaranteed to confuse the batter.
Keep on practicing. Learn to alternate between a changeup and a fastball so the batter doesn't know what's coming.
Keep the same arm speed and arm slot as you would for a fast ball. If your arm speed is slower, then the batter will know that your pitching speed will be slower too. The whole trick is in the illusion that you'll be throwing the ball at the same speed as a fastball.

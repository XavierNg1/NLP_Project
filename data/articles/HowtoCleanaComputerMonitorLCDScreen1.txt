Microfiber
Cotton T-shirt
Cotton handkerchief
Cotton tea towel


Avoid the following, as they are too abrasive:

Paper towels
Dish towels
Facial tissue

, Work in small circles, and avoid direct pressure on the monitor. Do not scrape at any smudges; allow the cleaner to dissolve them.

 Make sure that the monitor is completely dry before powering it back on. This will minimize the risk of moisture damaging the internal components.


Do not use blow driers or any other heating mechanism to speed up the drying process. Let the drying occur by air.

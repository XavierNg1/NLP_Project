 You will need about 1 to 3 tablespoons of chopped cilantro per stick of butter.
 It might help to cut the butter into smaller pieces.
 You can leave the cilantro butter as is, or you can add in a few other ingredients to make even tastier. Here are some ideas to get you started:1 clove garlic, minced
Salt and pepper, to taste
Â½ tablespoon of lime juice
Lime zest

, You can use a spoon or spatula. Work quickly, so that the butter does not melt. Add more butter or cilantro if necessary.
 Scoop the butter onto a sheet of parchment paper, making sure that it is close to the edge. Shape it into a rough log shape with a spoon or spatula. Roll it up in the parchment paper.
 Place the butter seam-side-down on a plate, and leave the place in the fridge until it hardens.
 To keep your freezer clean, keep the butter wrapped in parchment paper, and put it into a re-sealable freezer bag or a plastic container.
 This will help you remember when you made it, so that you can use it before it goes bad.

 If you have an issue with a particular rule, feel free to voice it. However, if your parents explain their reasoning and refuse to budge on a rule, you should accept it.For instance, if you have a curfew, observe it, and always notify them if you’re not going to make it in time.
Keep in mind that graciously accepting their rules and their “nos” can make it easier to get more leeway and “yeses” in the future. Chances are, if you stick to the curfew, they’ll trust you enough to extend it later.
 There’s no need to rebel against your parents. Demonstrating positive behavior, like respect for others’ feelings, bodies, and property, is admirable and normal. When you behave well, your parents are likely to treat you well., Often, parents do most of the work of running a household. Pitch in regularly towards keeping the place you live in order, and your parents are bound to take notice of your efforts.You could agree to a daily or weekly chore, like loading the dishwasher, doing the laundry, or mowing the lawn. Or, simply make a point of helping out when it seems like your parents are tired or could use an extra hand.

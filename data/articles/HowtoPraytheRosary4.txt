 Again, depending on the day, a different Mystery is appropriate. Choose from the following:2nd Joyful Mystery: The Visitation of Mary to Elizabeth (Luke 1:39-56)
2nd Luminous Mystery: The Wedding at Cana, when Christ manifested Himself (Jn 2:1-11)
2nd Sorrowful Mystery: Our Lord is Scourged at the Pillar (Matthew 27:26)
2nd Glorious Mystery: The Ascension of Our Lord (Luke 24:36-53)

, Do you see a pattern emerging? Apart from the introduction and conclusion, it's all the same. Big beads are Our Fathers, small beads are Hail Marys, and at the end of each decade (10 Hail Marys) is a Glory Be and, if desired, a Fatima Prayer.
 That is, 10 more Hail Mary prayers, one for each bead.
 Again, if desired, a FÃ¡tima Prayer fits in nicely right here.

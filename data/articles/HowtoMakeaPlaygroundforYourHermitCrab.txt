 It could be within your crab's regular habitat or within another tank. If you choose to have a separate tank to let your crab explore every now and then, be sure to choose an aquarium and NOT a terrarium. Terrariums are not suited for being filled with water or sand. Next, fill your tank with sea sand. Sea sand is available at most pet supply stores. Mix in hermit soil(also available at most pet supply stores) in with the sand to provide proper moisturizer and promote digging. Add a thermometer and hygrometer to the back of the tank. Even if the playground is not your crab's regular habitat, it needs to have proper heat and humidity conditions at all times.
 Tree branches, climbing tubes that are available from pet stores, rocks and shells will all do. Providing variety of these spread throughout the tank will make your hermit start to explore and climb!,

Create a "hermie hut" by turning a plastic or Styrofoam bowl upside down. Cut a half circle on one side of the bowl. Place this new hiding spot inside you crab's playground.
Purchase fake plants designed for aquariums from your local pet store. Spread them around the tank to create hiding places and to imitate a crab's natural habitat.
 To make salt water, use fresh, dechlorinated water mixed in with a salt water solution, NOT table salt. Placing small pebbles at the bottom of the water bowl will help to minimize slipping.

Always offer a separate bowl of fresh water for your crab.

 These are typically located on the back or side of the packaging near the ingredients list under "Guaranteed Analysis." Crude protein, fat, and fiber, as well as the moisture content are the basic nutritional guarantees required by the AAFCO for pet food.The term “crude” refers not to the quality of the nutrients themselves, but to the exact method of testing the product.
 You must do this in order to compare the percentages of protein, fat, and fiber per pound of food for different food brands. You cannot compare foods on their crude percentages alone; this is misleading.Dry matter refers to the mass of the food when it is completely dried. It includes carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
This will also help you determine if you are getting your money’s worth per pound of food.
 By locating the moisture content percentage, you can determine the dry matter percentage. For example, if a dry food contains 15 percent moisture, then 85 percent of the food is dry matter.On the other hand, if a canned food contains 85 percent moisture, then 15 percent of the food is dry matter.
 If the product contains 25 percent protein, then divide 25 by 85. This equals .29 or 29 percent. Therefore, for every pound of food, 29 percent of the food is protein. Use this calculation to compare different food brands’ protein, fat, and fiber content.Use this same method to calculate the percentages of fat and fiber as well.
Remember that these percentages do not refer to the quality of the protein, fat, and fiber. Therefore, a brand may have more protein, but you need to examine the ingredient list to determine the quality of the protein.

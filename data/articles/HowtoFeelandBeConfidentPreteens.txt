 If they tease you in a bad way, like teasing you about divorce or ugliness, just let it go. They're not worth your time, and they have no right whatsoever to tell you that. Pretty means your, well pretty. But beautiful means how you are on the inside. Try to focus on being beautiful rather then pretty.;
, Like I said, they have NO right whatsoever to say that! Try to be confident. Tell them firmly that they're being immature and being jerks. If they laugh at what you say, walk away. That proves to them that your mature and that they just seem like pests that aren't worth your time.
 You have many more perfections! Feeling good about yourself makes you confident. You'll notice that you walk straighter, and walk with bigger strides when you are confident! If you're nervous about your upcoming D.A.R.E essay that you have to present in front of the whole school, remember that we're all humans. We ALL have feelings. So don't be nervous. Feel confident and know that all your friends are supporting you! If you have to dance in a play in front of relatives, friends and strangers, pretend they're cabbages. It may sound corny, but confidence comes from within. People can't make you confident, only you can. We're all a family under the same sky, and we're all humans.

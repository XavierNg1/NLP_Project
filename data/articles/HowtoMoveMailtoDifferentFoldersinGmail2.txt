 It's located at https://www.google.com/gmail/. If you're already logged into Gmail, doing so opens your inbox.


If you aren't logged into Gmail, click SIGN IN in the top-right corner of the page and enter your email address and password.
 It's the bottom option in the option tree that's on the left side of the inbox page.
 This option is at the bottom of the More section of the option tree.
 Doing so will add your label to the tree of options.


You can also check the Nest label under box and then select an existing label to make this label a subfolder.
 To do so, click the box on the far left of each email you wish to label.
 It's a tag-shaped icon near the top of your inbox, just below the search field.


You can also just click and drag the selected emails onto the label that's on the left side of the page and then drop them there.
 Doing so will automatically apply your label to the selected emails, which means you'll be able to click the label in the left-hand sidebar in order to view the emails.


If you want to hide the emails from your inbox, click the "Archive" button (the box with a downward-facing arrow at the top of your inbox). They'll disappear from your inbox but remain viewable by clicking the label's name.

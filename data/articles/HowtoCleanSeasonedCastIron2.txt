 When you’re left with a lot of gunk and grime after cooking, you may need to turn to a solution that works a little better than plain water. Shake in just enough salt to cover the bottom of the pan. Drizzle a few ounces of water onto the salt and stir the two ingredients together until they form a thick paste.Use a more substantial type of salt, such as kosher salt, sea salt or coarse-ground rock salt.The rough edges of the salt grains make it an effective (but not too abrasive) astringent agent for scouring cast iron without fear of damaging it.
 Go over the cast iron lightly using a gentle circular motion. Concentrate on the spots where residue is the heaviest. The salt paste should make it possible for you to lift away messes without a lot of effort.Be careful not to scour your cookware too hard. Always use the least amount of force necessary.
If you’re still having trouble after using salt, heat the pan on the cooktop to burn away the last few bits of solid food. They can then be wiped away easily with a paper towel.
 Flush with warm water to get rid of the last traces of salt. As you rinse, sweep the bottom of the pan lightly with your sponge. There should be no salt or food residue visible on the surface when you’re done.Don’t forget to check for salt on the underside of the pan and inside the grooves of the handle.
Keep rinsing until the water runs clear. Salt can also be hard on iron surfaces.
 Shake off the excess moisture, then towel dry your cookware from top to bottom or heat it briefly on the stove. Afterwards, you’ll need to reseason the cast iron to keep its nonstick finish properly conditioned.Make sure there’s no water left on the pan before you put it away.

 You can find this option under your profile picture on the left side of the screen.
 You can find this option under "Basic Info" in the middle of the right side of the page.
 You can click on the arrows to select the month, day, and year when you were born. Remember that if you recently changed your birthday, you won't be able to do it again for a few more days; Facebook does this on purpose to make sure that users maintain a legitimate identity.
 Once you've changed your birthday, you can select one of three settings:


"Show my full birthday on my timeline." This is the most common option for younger people.
"Show only month & day of my birth on my timeline." This is a helpful option if you don't want people knowing exactly how young or old you are.
"Don't show my birthday on my timeline." This is a great option if you're tired of getting hundreds of wall posts from people you barely know on your birthday. It's also a great way to check who your real friends are--how many of your friends would remember your birthday if it weren't for Facebook?

, Select this option at the bottom of the window and you will have finished changing your birthday on Facebook.

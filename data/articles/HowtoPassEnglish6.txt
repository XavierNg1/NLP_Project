 Rather than staying up all night for one big cram session the night before a test, try studying in small sessions over the course of a week. Studying in smaller sessions will make it easier for you to retain the information that you take in and it will be less stressful for you as well.For example, if you have a test on Friday and you expect that you will need to study for about six hours to get a passing grade on the test, then break your study sessions into three two hours sessions over the course of the week.
Make sure that you take a short break every 45 minutes as well. Most people canâ€™t concentrate for more than 45 minutes at a time, so taking a short break (about 5 to 10 mins) will help you to reset and stay focused., Some instructors offer review sessions before an exam to go over the material that will be on the test. Make sure that you attend these sessions whenever they are offered.


It can be tempting to skip review classes, since it is a review of old material, but you will increase your chances of passing English if you attend.
 Before you take the actual test, taking a practice test may be beneficial. Try asking your instructor for some practice test questions to help you prepare or come up with some practice questions of your own. You can create a practice test based on your knowledge of what will be on the test.When you take the practice test, make sure that you simulate an actual test environment. Put away your notes, books, etc. and time yourself. Check your answers when you are done and use your results to help you figure out what you need to spend more time studying.
 Being well-rested is one of the best ways to ensure that you will be able to focus on a test. Make sure that you go to bed a bit earlier than usual the night before your English test.


For example, if your usual bedtime is 11pm, try going to bed at 10pm instead.

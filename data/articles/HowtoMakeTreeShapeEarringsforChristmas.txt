 Use the image shown here to guide you through the steps in this tutorial part.;
, It must be longer than the spiral you're about the make, to allow for adjustments, etc,, so about 35cm/13.7 inches

, To do this:


Gently roll up or coil the wire to form a spiral. As shown in the image, begin with a very small roll first, then gradually roll the length of wire around this first coil.
Continue until the spiral is large enough. It is recommended that you use about 30cm/12 inches of the length of wire to make the complete spiral.
Cut the remaining wire off but leave a short length that will be used to hold the tree as you work with the beads, before it is later rolled into a circle and/or cut off.
 Place the spiral on one prong of the pliers, then gradually pull the coils apart one by one, to stretch out the tree. Be sure to separate the loops to leave even spaces as you go. (See the image above.) The tree is now ready for adding beads; just be sure to make its partner for a pair of earrings.
 The original coil you made when making the spiral will act as a stopper when the beads reach it.


When you reach the base of the tree, roll a short length of wire into a small loop. This may require cutting off excess wire; judge it before you form the shape.
 Thread the red Czech glass bead onto an eye-pin. Cut the excess wire off the eye-pin, leaving enough to roll into loop the same size as the existing loop at the top of the eye-pin. Attach this piece to the base loop under the tree using one of the loops, allowing it to dangle free.
, Connect a brass link to the top loop of the wire tree with a jumpring, then attach an earring hook to the brass link.


The little bow is optional but makes for a sweet touch.
 The Christmas tree shape earrings are now ready for wearing.

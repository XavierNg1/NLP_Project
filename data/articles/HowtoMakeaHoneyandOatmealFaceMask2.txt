 If you suffer from acne, then this mask may be just the thing for you. It contains ground oats, honey, lemon juice, and tea tree oil. Here are the benefits of each ingredient:


Oats act as a natural cleanser and have both exfoliating and anti-inflammatory properties.Honey has both antibacterial and antioxidant properties, which make it great for managing acne and blackheads.Lemons have antibacterial and anti-fungal properties, which makes them great for managing acne and blackheads. Tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic.Tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic and toner.
 If your oats are whole or too grainy, then you can grind them up in a blender, a coffee grinder, or a food processor.
 Because you are working in such small amounts, you can use anything as your mixing bowl, from a cup to a small bowl to even an old yogurt container.
 Measure out 2 tablespoons of ground oats and pour them into your bowl.
 Measure out 2 tablespoons of honey and add it into the mixing bowl. You want the runny, translucent type of honey.
 You need ½ tablespoon of lemon juice. Using fresh lemon juice is recommended over concentrated lemon juice, which may be too harsh for your skin.


If you don't have fresh lemon juice, simply cut a lemon in half and squeeze the juice out from one of the halves until you have enough. Add the lemon juice into the mixture, wrap up the remaining lemon, and store it in the fridge for later use.
 You will need ½ tablespoon of the lemon juice and 4 drops of tea tree essential oil.
 Using a spoon or fork, mix everything together until you get a thick, grainy paste. This will be enough for one or two facials.

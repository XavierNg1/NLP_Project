 In a medium-sized bowl, blend the cream cheese with a hand or electric blender. Cream for about two minutes until the cream cheese is smooth and fluffy.
 Scrape the marshmallow creme and add it to the cream cheese. Blend again on medium speed for about a minute until well-combined. The mixture should be white and fluffy., Slowly add the Nutella and peanut butter. Blend on high speed for about two minutes until the dip resembles a light brown color and is creamy., Using a rubber spatula, scrape the Nutella and peanut butter dip into a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Refrigerate for about an hour so the dip can chill and become slightly thick., Get out a serving plate and spread any desired ingredients to use for your dip. Examples can range from anything sweet such as apples, bananas, sweet graham crackers, pears, and strawberries to the savory such as salty crackers, pretzels, and potato chips. Remove the dip from the fridge and place it on the serving plate.,

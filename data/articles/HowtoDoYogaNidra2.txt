 It is also an option to sit in a comfortable position, but some have found using this position to be unsuccessful. If you choose to lie down, extend your body as far as you can, flattening your body out. Position your head wherever it feels most comfortable.
 Relax your eyes, letting them simply lay on your eyeballs, not squeezing them shut.
 Breathe in through your nose, gradually filling your lungs with air, then exhale through your mouth. Try to inhale and exhale on a 10 second count.
 Focus only on that body part, not allowing your mind to become distracted by other things.
 You should now feel completely relaxed, all tension

, As you did with each body part, visualize your entire body just as it is now. For some people, it helps to visualize a glowing aura around themselves.
 Gently move your fingers for a few moments, take a deep breath, and then open your eyes. Expect to come out of Yogic Sleep naturally, whether you return after only 15 minutes or a whole hour.
 Do not get up, or try to aggressively rouse yourself. Simply sit criss-cross, or if you are more advanced, try sitting in the lotus position.
 This will help your body to become fully awake, and completely out of Yogic Sleep.

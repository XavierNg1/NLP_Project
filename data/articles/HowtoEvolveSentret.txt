 Sentret is not found in many games, but here are all of the locations it can be found. In other games, you will have to trade or transfer Sentret over:


Gold/Silver - Route 1 and 29.
Crystal - Same as GS, but with Route 43 added.
Fire Red/Leaf Green - Canyon Entrance, Five Isle Meadow and Water Path.
Diamond/Pearl/Platinum - Route 202 with the Poké Radar.
Heart Gold/Soul Silver - Same as GS, but with the Safari Zone added. Also, it is found in the Refreshing Field on the Pokéwalker.
Black/White - Route 7 (Swarm).
X/Y - Route 6.;
, If you traded for it, it will be where the Pokémon it replaced used to be. If you caught it in the wild, it will be closest to your current box when you open the PC as possible (if you had Box 3 opened and it was full, Sentret would be in Box 4 in the space nearest to the start of the box). However, if you caught it while there were spots in your party, Sentret will already be there.
 However, don't go as high as Level 100 (at Level 100, Sentret can't evolve). Use tools in your game such as the Exp. Share and the Daycare to do this, if necessary.
 You can lose or win this battle; Sentret will still evolve. Also, it's worth mentioning that if your Sentret is above Level 15, you can just level it up to the next level possible and the evolution scene will still commence.


Assuming everything is correct and your Sentret isn't holding an Everstone, a cutscene should commence. This varies for different games, due to graphical changes.

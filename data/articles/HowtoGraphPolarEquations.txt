 Coordinates in polar equations are of the form (r,θ), where r represents radius and θ represents angle. This means you rotate θ radians around and go out r units.;
, Take any random values of θ (around ten values would suffice) and calculate r against each of them using the relationship given between r and θ. This will help you plot them out on a graph easier, because you can just refer to a table instead of having to come up with coordinates in your head.

The wikiHow How to Plot Polar Coordinates will be helpful.

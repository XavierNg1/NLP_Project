 Width is the same as your website template (ex. 950 pixels). Height does not matter but should be big enough to easily use Photoshop Slice Tool (ex. 250 pixels). Color should be the same as your website body.;
, Width should be smaller than the larger document (ex. 800 pixels). Height should be smaller than the larger document (ex. 100 pixels). Color should be the same as your content area.
 In the Layers Palette, double click on the word "Background" and change it to any other name. This will free up functionality and allow you to easily add a drop shadow. Open the Layers Style dialog box, click on "Drop Shadow" and set the variables as follows:


Opacity 75%
Angle -90 degrees
Distance 0 px
Spread 35%
Size 35 px
Color #7B7979 (gray shadow)

, Using the examples above, this image will be 950 pixels wide by 250 pixels high with the smaller, shadowed image embedded on top of it.
 Grab the Photoshop Slice Tool from the Tool Palette. In the top toolbar, set the Style to "Fixed Size" to ensure exact proportions. Using the 950px X 250px example, input width and height as follows:


Top slice equals 950px X 100px
Middle slice equals 950px X 50px
Bottom slice equals 950px X 100px

You now have one document sliced horizontally into 3 smaller images.
, Upload the 3 gif images as usual.
 The first row in your table contains the top shadow gif, the middle row contains your middle shadow gif and content and the last row in your table contains the bottom shadow gif.

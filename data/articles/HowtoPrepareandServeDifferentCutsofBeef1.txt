Retail beef cuts receive the following grades: Prime, Choice and Select. All meat is rated based on marbling. Marbling is the white flecks of fat within meat. Marbling promotes tenderness and a higher fat content. Prime has the most marbling and is the most tender cut of meat. Choice and Select grades are each lower in marbling. Standard, Commercial, Utility, Cutter, and Canner grades are normally used in processed foods. They are usually not sold retail.

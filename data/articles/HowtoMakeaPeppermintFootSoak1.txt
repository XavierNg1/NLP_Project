 To start, use a pair of scissors or your hands to cut open both bags of tea. Pour the contents of the tea bags into a mixing bowl. Choose a medium to large sized mixing bowl, as this will likely be big enough to hold all your ingredients., Use a spoon to stir the mixture together. You want the ingredients to be combined uniformly. This should only take a few minutes of stirring.You can use a wooden mixing spoon or a large silver spoon to mix your ingredients.
 A mason jar or another jar with a tight fitting lid will work to store the ingredients. Transfer your mixture to a jar and put it in your bathroom until you're ready to use it to scrub your feet.Make sure you choose a jar with a tight fitting lid. A jar without a lid will not store your ingredients safely.
 When you're ready to use your scrub, use 1/2 to 1/3 of the jar. Mix the scrub in a tub filled with hot water. Then, soak your feet for 15 to 20 minutes. This should reduce any soreness and moisturize your feet.

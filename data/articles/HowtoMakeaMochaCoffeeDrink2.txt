 Here's what you'll need to make a mocha coffee drink using espresso:


Espresso Roast (regular or decaf)
2 tablespoons (30 g) hot water
1 tablespoon (15 g) unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon (15 g) sugar
A pinch of salt
1/2 cup milk (any variety)
1 tablespoon flavored syrup (optional)

, This will make the classic chocolate flavoring you can find in your favorite cafe; it will be so much more gratifying than just pouring Hershey's syrup into your coffee. That stuff is for children.
 You want enough to fill just about half of your mug. If you don't want that much caffeine, consider combining it with a decaf roast or using fewer beans in your brew.
 If you have a steamer, of course. If you don't, you can just add your milk straight to your espresso and heat in the microwave or throw the milk onto the stovetop and heat to 160째F (70째C). But if you have an espresso machine, you probably have a steamer!


Make sure the tip of your steamer isn't too near the bottom or too near the top of your milk. You want it not too be too bubbly and aerated, but also not burned and over-steamed. It should only take about 15 seconds, and if you have a thermometer, stop around 160째F (70째C).
Is your mug Central Perk-style large? Then you may want closer to 3/4 of a cup.
 But be sure to hold a large spoon to the edge of your steamed milk to hold back the foam. You want that stuff to go on top, after the milk and chocolate have combined.


Once all the milk has gone into your mug, spoon out the foam so it rests uniformly on top, putting the proverbial icing on the cake.
 Bam! Mocha created. If you have a flavored syrup lying around that you'd like to add (maybe caramel or raspberry), add it at this stage.
 Because it's not enough that it tastes good, it's got to look good too. You can also top it with caramel, cinnamon, or turbinado sugar. Heck, birthday sprinkles and a cherry if you'd like. Now all you have to do is drink up!

 Another way to help your dog come inside is to train them to come when called. Place them on a long rope lead, long enough that they can run around and play. Start by making it into a game by getting your dog to chase you while saying, “Come!” Give the dog a treat, enthusiastic praise, and a special toy when they come to you. Start when the dog is close to you and expand the distance between you as they learn.Start moving towards the house as you call them. Wait to call them inside until after they learn to come to you while out in the yard.
If the dog doesn’t comply with your command, gently pull them towards you. Don’t punish the dog, yell at them, or hit them. Just pull them to you enough to nudge them towards you.
This helps the dog learn how that coming when you call them results in happy things, like treats or praise.
 You should make your dog associate coming to you with positive experiences, like getting pets, praise, a toy, or a treat. If you call your dog to you to punish them or do something unwanted like a bath or nail trimming, you are giving your dog a negative association with coming to you.For example, never call the dog to you in an angry voice.
After calling your dog to you, don’t hit them, punish them, or do something unpleasant.
 Sometimes, you may be so frustrated with your dog that you want to drag them inside by their collar. This is a negative response which will make your dog fearful of you and being inside the house. You want to avoid making your dog scared of the house.Don’t yell at your dog when they come inside the house. This will make them associate coming into the house with punishment.

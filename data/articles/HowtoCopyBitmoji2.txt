 It’s the green icon with a white winking chat bubble in the app drawer.

There’s no real way to copy a Bitmoji from the Android app, but you can save it to your device to share with other apps.
 To find it, use the icons at the top of the screen to view different categories, then scroll down to see all of the options., It’s the last option (a purple icon with an arrow) in the icon list., Do this if you’re asked to allow Bitmoji to access photos, media, and files on your device. The Bitmoji will now save to a folder called “Bitmoji” on your device., The steps to do this depend on the app you’re using, but you’ll be able to share it with any app that allows you to share images (e.g. Facebook, Android Messages, WhatsApp, Gmail).Open the app with which you want to share your Bitmoji, then look for the Attach button—it usually looks like a camera, plus (+) sign, or paper clip. You’ll see a list of folders on your device.
Navigate to the Bitmoji folder. You may have to choose something like “Local images” or “Local Device” to find it.
Tap the Bitmoji to select it.

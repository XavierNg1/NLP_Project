Set the width of your compass to a small or medium-sized circle. Place the point of your compass on the sketch paper, and gently place the pencil tip of the compass down on the paper. Pivot the pencil tip around the stationary point of the compass to draw your circle.
It may be helpful to lightly hold onto both “legs” of the compass, as the angle can sometimes widen with the pressure of pivoting and drawing. This will help maintain the size of your circle.;
,


Draw the lines as close to the middle from top-to-bottom and side-to-side as you can. This will help ensure that your eyes are placed evenly and at an equal distance from each other.
 Around the baseline of the circle, draw the shape of your character's head.


The shape of the character's head will inspire you in the type of eyes you give your character.
It will also help you determine whether your character is male or female or maybe even an animal or monster!
Drawing the shape of the head will include the chin/jawline, ears, and hairline.

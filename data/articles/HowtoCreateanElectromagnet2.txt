 Once your done wrapping the wire, connect either ends of the wire to the battery. Connect one end to the negative side and one end to the positive side. Make sure the portions of the wire that have been stripped of insulation are the ends touching the battery. Use your rubber band to strap the wires in place by wrapping the rubber band around the battery from the negative end to the positive end.








It does not matter which end of the wire is connected to which end of the battery. It will work either way.If a rubber band is not holding the wires in place, you can use two pieces of masking tape instead.
 You should now have successfully created an electromagnetic. To test the magnet, hover the battery over a metallic item like a paper clip. The paperclip should rise up and attach to the battery. You have created a magnetic charge with the wire, nail, and battery.








If you want to increase the strength of your battery, increase the number of coils running around your nail. This will allow your electromagnet to pick up more objects., In the event your magnet does not work, check the battery. A dead or low charge battery may not be effective in creating an electromagnet. If the battery is fine, review your process. You may have curled the wire in opposite directions, disrupting the flow of electrons. You may also have forgotten to remove the insulation from the wire.

 Not only can the people close to you help with childcare, they can also be good listeners.
 Get together with other parents who have kids close in age to your own. The socialization will be good for you and your children.


Share stress management secrets. All parents feel some sort of stress. Try to get an idea of how others reduce the effects of stress on their lives.
 Whether you want to do the grocery shopping on your own, take a yoga class or spend a romantic evening with your spouse, having a babysitter your kids love on call can greatly reduce your stress as a parent.
 There are support groups available in most areas for all sorts of parents. These can be especially helpful for single parents, or parents of children who have special challenges such as disabilities like ADHD or autism.

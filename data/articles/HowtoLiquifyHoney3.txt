 Stirring the honey with a sturdy spoon will cause friction.Anyone who's gotten a friction burn will know firsthand that rubbing two surfaces together very quickly produces heat. This heat helps liquefy the honey. So if you find yourself with a clump of crystallized honey and don't have a microwave or burner, or simply want to try something new, stir vigorously for 30 seconds to a minute and see if the problem isn't solved.


If you're trying to prevent crystallization in the first place, the type of honey you have will determine how quickly it crystallizes. Honey with high glucose content will crystallize much faster than honey with low glucose. So alfalfa, cotton, and dandelion honey will crystallize much faster than sage, longan, or Tupelo honey.Stirring these types of honey is just a delay tactic.
 Small particles like pollen grains, flecks of wax, and air bubbles become the “seeds” of crystallization if left in honey. Remove them with a polyester microfilter and prolong the life of your liquefied honey.


If you don’t have a microfilter, consider using a fine nylon cloth or even cheesecloth on top of a sieve as a filter.
 The ideal storage temperature of honey ranges from 21-27°C (70-80°F). Try to store honey in an environment with a fairly regulated temperature.
 As soon as you notice crystals forming, liquefy them. The first crystal growth starts slowly but will accelerate if the crystals are left undisturbed, so stay vigilant and you won’t have to deal with a crystallized mass of honey nearly as often, if ever.

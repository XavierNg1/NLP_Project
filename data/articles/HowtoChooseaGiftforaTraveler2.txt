 Lugging around a heavy laptop on your world travels can be a drag. If the traveler in your life tends to travel with a laptop in tow, a lightweight laptop is a great way to lighten their load. Opt for models that have a slim design, a screen that’s less than 13.5 inches (35 centimeters), and weigh in at 3 pounds or less., If the traveler in your life doesn’t need to lug a laptop around with them on their journeys, a tablet is a great gift that will allow them access at a portion of the weight. A tablet is a lot cheaper than a lightweight laptop, and can give your traveler the access they need. Opt for models that are compatible with travel-friendly keyboards to maximize benefits., Reading is an important part of any traveler’s itinerary. Whether you are perusing a guidebook for suggestions on local restaurants, or passing time in an airport with a classic novel, having access to reading material is a must for any traveler. An e-reader will allow the traveler in your life to transport their favorite tales to faraway places for a fraction of the weight., Let’s face it. Air travel can be downright noisy. A screaming baby or a seatmate listening to lousy music a little too loudly can turn an uncomfortable plane ride into one that is nearly unbearable. Save the sanity of your favorite traveler by giving them a set of noise canceling headphones., If your favorite traveler tends to see the world with their significant other in tow, a headphone splitter will allow the couple to watch movies or listen to podcasts at the same time. This budget-friendly gift can be easily stuffed into a stocking or tied on top a larger present.

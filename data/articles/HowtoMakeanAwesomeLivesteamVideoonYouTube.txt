 It is easier if you write a script beforehand, so that you know what to say. However, also play it by ear and add or remove things as you go, and don't make it obvious you are reading from a script. If possible, you could even learn the script off by heart to seem more natural.;
, Are you gaming, singing, responding to comments or just vlogging?

, If you are playing Minecraft, then don't put the title as "eating watermelon" as people will watch wanting to watch something else (in the example, people would want to watch watermelon, and stop watching when they found that it was Minecraft).
 This could offend many people, and many would stop watching your videos. Also keep swearing within reason.
 Don't livestream at 5:00 AM or midnight, as most people won't be online. Some good times are: 12:00 pm, 1:00 pm, 4:00pm, 5:pm, 8:00pm or 9:00 pm, as these times are when people are less likely to be working/sleeping/having a meal.
 You want to look good in front of the world, right? Choose makeup and hair accordingly to what you will be doing and your personality.
 If in one video you say you live in England and in the next video you say you are living in Canada, people may suspect you are lying and they'll stop watching.
 It's fine to be nervous before going live to the world, but act calm and confident. If you say something wrong, or drop the camera etc, play it cool and nobody will think much of it.
 A good length to aim for is between 10 to 20 minutes.
 Be sure to take it into account next time. If someone says "You have good things to say, but you talk so fast I can't quite catch all of it", then speak slower next time.
 If you don't enjoy it, don't do it!

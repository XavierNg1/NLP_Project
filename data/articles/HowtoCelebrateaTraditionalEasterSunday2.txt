 Easter Sunday church services vary in traditions, depending upon the denomination and style of worship. Most Easter Sunday services follow the church's standard order of worship, but usually incorporate festive music. Many churches decorate their worship spaces with Easter lilies or special liturgical banners. Some churches celebrate Holy Communion, while others observe the sacrament of baptism, which is a symbol of new life in Christ.
 The first Easter sunrise service occurred in 1732 at a hilltop graveyard Germany. The attendees celebrated the resurrection of Christ among the graves of the deceased as the sun rose on the hill. Moravian Missionaries spread the concept of the Easter sunrise service around the world, including the United States. Many Christian churches now offer early morning sunrise or "sunrise " services on the church grounds or in a nearby park.
 Many Christian denominations begin observing Easter on Saturday night with an Easter vigil. The vigil typically begins in darkness and involves lighting a large Paschal candle. The service includes readings from the Old Testament and New Testament. When the story of the resurrection is read, lights are turned on and church bells are rung. The Easter vigil concludes with Holy Communion, often referred to as the Eucharist.

 While it is often considered traditional to have "the whole family" together, having your relatives stay in your home overnight is a stressful endeavour. You are then responsible for preparing multiple meals for large groups, entertaining them, and give up a large part of your privacy all at once. You and your guests might not end up well-rested, which can lead to uncomfortable grouchiness. Consider booking a sufficient amount of hotel or motel rooms for your relatives and guests well ahead of time to keep everything as affordable as possible. They will still be spending a large amount of time at your house, so you have a merry time, but this will give you time to rest and restore yourself in the evening, at least.
 Once again, speak to your guests ahead of time so that you are not slaving away in the kitchen for at least 2 breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. Split up tasks amongst your guests, too, especially if they are family members. Ask them to run to the store and restock beverages and snacks, for example. Consider going out to eat to a pancake restaurant for breakfast instead of getting up at 5 a.m. to make 50 pancakes at home.

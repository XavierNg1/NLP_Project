 Laptop users will typically be unable to access the jumper. If you are using a laptop, you will need to use a backdoor password instead. These passwords are encrypted, but can be decrypted by running special key generating scripts.
 When prompted for the password, guess three times. This will lead to the System Disabled screen. Donâ€™t worry, the system is not actually disabled, it will boot up again when the power is reset.
 You will need this to generate the BIOS backdoor password. The series may contain letters as well as numbers.
 On a working computer, visit this site and enter the code from the laptop. The program will generate a password for you. This may take a few minutes.


Some laptops use the serial number of the laptop itself to generate a password. Refer to the table on the More Details section in the above website to see what numbers to input.

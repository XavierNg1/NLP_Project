 The Law of Return is a rule enacted by the Israeli government in 1950 that allows all Jews, both ethnic and religious, to return to Israel as their homeland and gain citizenship.This law was created largely to create a route to safety for Jews who were misplaced by the Holocaust, and for their descendants.
A returning Jew is called an oleh (male) or olah (female).
 If you're Jewish, which is defined as being born to a mother who is Jewish or having converted to Judaism, then there is not much that you need to do. Israel will welcome you with open arms. All you have to do is go there and formally request citizenship. You can also be considered a Jew according to this law if you converted to Judaism and are not a member of another religion.
If you converted to Judaism, you’ll need a letter from an Orthodox rabbi that you can bring to the rabbinical court. This group is part of the Israeli justice system and they determine who is considered Jewish or not., The Israeli government can deny anyone citizenship under the Law of Return who they deem might be a threat to the Israeli population or who might engage in activities intended to harm Jews.This caveat is meant as a safeguard for the existing citizens of Israel and to keep people out who mean them harm.
This means that you should avoid any involvement in extremist groups, especially those who are anti-Semitic. You should also ensure that you have no criminal record and that you aren’t infected with a contagious disease.

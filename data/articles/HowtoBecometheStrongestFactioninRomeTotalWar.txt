 Money is the main thing because if you don't have money you can't build armies, buildings or hire mercenaries. which means you will lose. To get lots of money you have to make your people pay taxes and keep them happy. The main way to make money is to capture as many cities as you can, because it just makes people pay more.;
, To have a good army you have to have good people to train. Now if you're in the beginning of the game all you can hire is town watch, hastati, and peasants. Peasants make come in higher numbers but they're very, very weak and should only be used as a last resort. Hastati are the best people in the beginning of the game but they do throw javelins before they go into hand to hand combat. Town watch should only be used to fight armies coming into the middle of your area. Town watch should also only be used to fight weak armies. To get good armies you just have to build the barracks, stables, and different archery ranges and a good thing to keep in mind is that you want to build the type of building you need the most, you just don't want pure military power.
 Great armies consist of warlord cavalry, principles, triarii, praetorian cohorts,and much more. Warlord cavalry is the generals cavalry and are strong. Principles are the oldest men in the army and are very strong when in numbers. They the Triarii and Praetorian cohorts are what you call heavy infantry. Triarii are best against cavalry and are great against infantry to.
 Firstly, the Greeks. The Greeks are a really powerful faction but mostly depend on spear men not cavalry. Secondly, the Carthaginians. They depend on one unit... elephants. They are extremely powerful and their faction should be destroyed as soon as possible to prevent them from getting armored elephants.

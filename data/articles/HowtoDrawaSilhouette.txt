 Put a rectangle at the bottom, just barely overlapping the lower edge as seen.;
, Add two lines to indicate the shape of the face. At this point it should almost like a stick figure boxing, or reaching up to high-five another stick figure.
 The arc will be the back of the head and the triangle is the curve of the neck.
 Connect the shapes to one another, so the silhouette starts looking more like a face and less like a work of abstract art.
 Draw the shadow of the hair by adding a few tufts near the top and the back.
 Fill the entire thing in with black color to finish up the silhouette.

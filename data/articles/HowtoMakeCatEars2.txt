 For your furry cat ears, you need two clips, furry felt, cardboard, glue (a hot glue gun or fabric glue works best), a ruler, and scissors. Bobby pins are too skinny to work with, make sure to get some clips that are at least half an inch wide. You want to use flat clips, French clips, or an alligator clips.
 You need to cut both the cardboard and the fabric for your ears. You can make triangular or oval ears—depending on what look you want to go for. For triangle ears, cut two equilateral triangles out of your cardboard.
 Wrap your fabric around the cardboard pieces to give you the shape you need. Mark a line where you wish to cut—mark it on the inside of the fabric. Add ½” to this outline and cut your fabric.
 Take your fabric and glue it around your cardboard ears. It will look best if you wrap the fabric over the top and glue at the base of your ear.
, On the bottom of the back of your ears, hot glue your clips. Glue the ears to the top side of the clip—the bottom side will be against your head when you wear them.
 Once the glue dries, put your hair in pigtails. Place the clips above the elastics in a spot comfortable for your cat ears.

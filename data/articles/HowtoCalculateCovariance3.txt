 Several schools, programming companies or other sources have created websites that will very easily calculate covariance values for you. Using any search engine, enter the search term “covariance calculator.”
, Read the instructions on the website carefully to make sure that you enter your data properly. It is important that your data pairs are kept in order, or you will generate an incorrect covariance result. Different websites have different styles for entering your data.

For example, at the website http://ncalculators.com/statistics/covariance-calculator.htm, there is a horizontal box for entering x-values and a second horizontal box for entering y-values. You are instructed to enter your terms, separated only by commas. Thus, the x-data set that was calculated earlier in this article would be entered as 1,3,2,5,8,7,12,2,4. The y-data set would be 8,6,9,4,3,3,2,7,7.

At another site, https://www.thecalculator.co/math/Covariance-Calculator-705.html, you are prompted to enter your x-data in the first box. Data is entered vertically, with one item per line. Therefore, the entry on this site would look like:

1

3

2

5

8

7

12

2

4


, The attraction of these calculation sites is that after you enter your data, you generally need only to click on the button that says “Calculate,” and the results will appear automatically. Most sites will provide you with the intermediate calculations of the x(avg), y(avg), and n.

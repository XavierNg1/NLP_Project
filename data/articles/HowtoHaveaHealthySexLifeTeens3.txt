 You've determined that you enjoy being sexual with your partner, but are still not ready to have sex. Perhaps you're just not ready now, or you may have decided that you want to wait until marriage before you engage in sexual intercourse.


If you are avoiding sex for religious or cultural reasons, understand that some of the practices in this section may be considered sex by your community's standards.
 What is it? Heavy petting is erotic contact between two people that stops short of penetrative sex (vaginal, anal, or oral). The risk of disease and pregnancy are greatly reduced, though there is still a very small risk in either case, depending on the level of intimate contact.
 This can range from all-clothes-on "dry humping," to all-clothes off touching sessions including mutual masturbation and sexual satisfaction. Because orgasm is generally part of the process, it's safe to say this is sexual activity, and does carry a low risk of pregnancy or disease. However, neither result is likely.


Neither partner should feel obligated to perform other sexual acts to avoid intercourse.
 While oral sex can be pleasurable for both partners, it is not without its risks. Pregnancy is not an issue, but disease transmission is still possible.


The CDC reports that over 60% of U.S. residents between the ages of 15 and 24 have had oral sex, compared to about 50% who have had vaginal intercourse.The CDC study also reports that patients visiting STD clinics have shown that 5-10% have gonorrhea in the throat, and can raise the risk for infection by chlamydia, herpes, syphilis, and cancer-linked HPV, and recommends using safe sex techniques when performing oral sex.

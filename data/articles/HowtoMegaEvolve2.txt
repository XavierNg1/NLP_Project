 You won't get access to Mega Evolutions until a little ways into the story. Defeat Norman, the 5th Gym Leader, and then make your way to the next town. You'll meet Steven and then head to Southern Island. Defeat Team Aqua/Magma to receive the Mega Bracelet., All of the Mega Stones that were available in X and Y can be found in Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby as well. Many of them require that you defeat or capture Groudon or Kyogre, which happens towards the end of the game. Some Mega Stones require you to meet other conditions. For example, Lucarionite requires that you obtain the Master Rank in all five categories of a Pokémon Contest, and then you'll need to defeat Lisia. Different stones have different requirements.

* To get Diancite, you'll need to have traded a Diancie from X or Y to your Alpha Sapphire or Omega Ruby game. You'll receive the Diancite the next time that you enter a Pokémon Center.** Rayquaza does not use a Mega Stone to Mega Evolve. Instead, it needs to learn the move Dragon Ascent.
 If you want your Pokémon to be able to Mega Evolve, it will need to be holding its Mega Stone. You can't do this during battle, so make sure that you've equipped it beforehand., This will cause your Pokémon to perform its Mega evolution. If you have multiple Pokémon that can Mega Evolve, only one is able to per battle. The Pokémon will stay in its Mega form until you have finished the battle or until it is knocked out. You can switch the Pokémon out and then back without having to go through the Mega evolution again.

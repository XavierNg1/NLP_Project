 Does house music get you moving, or pop music, Latin beats or Hip Hop? Deciding what music you like is key, because if you enjoy the music played in the class you will enjoy dancing and exercising to it too.;
, Is it just for fitness or is it to learn how to dance? Some classes focus on both learning simple dance steps techniques and routines as well as fitness, others simply getting fit by following the teachers steps.
 watching a video at home, in a class with others or online in a virtual studio? Whichever suits you and your schedule best will ultimately be the best format for you to learn.
 If your friends currently attend a class, tag along. Often teachers will offer bring a friend free to regular attendees.
 If you enjoy hip hop music you will probably enjoy a street dance based fitness class, if you enjoy Latin beats try salsacize or zumba, if you enjoy sassy diva soundtracks try burlesque and jazz dance workouts.
 If the teacher is warm and friendly on the phone/twitter/email/facebook then they will definitely have a warm, fun and friendly class full of similar people.
, 2 years experience of teaching fitness and dance is a good indicator of knowledge and experience, as well as an industry recognized qualification or recommendation.
 Often good knowledgeable instructors will recommend and sell quality products to compliment their classes.

 As with any stain, the faster you move to treat the stain, the more success you will have removing it. This may be particularly difficult with vomit, since handling clothing covered with vomit is not very appealing, but it's in your best interest to work quickly., If treated immediately, a strong blast of water may be enough to get the vomit out of your clothes. Organic stains can sometimes be removed with a little water and agitation.
 Because the stain will be far more difficult to remove if it is allowed to dry and set, immersing the soiled clothing in water will prevent the stain from drying.

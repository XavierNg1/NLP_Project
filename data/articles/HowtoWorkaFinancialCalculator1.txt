 You will often need to execute advanced applications on hand-held financial calculators using the 2 shift keys.


F shift key: This activates the gold alternate functions that appear over the standard-function keys. Some of the important f keys include AMORT (amortization) and NPV (net present value).
G shift key: This key activate the blue alternate function keys that appear slanted on the standard keys. Some of the important g keys are 12x, which you use to adjust an annual interest rate, and END, which you would use for payments set to end at a specific period.;
, If you use certain formulas often, you can store them in the calculator by selecting the f shift key and then pressing P/R. Most hand-held calculators will allow you to save several programs.
 Top hand-held financial calculators can perform basic mathematical equations or complex financial computations, like partial-year depreciation and full investment analysis. For example, to find the percentage your stock lost when it fell from $61.25 per share to $57.50, you would in follow these steps:


Type in 61.25 and hit ENTER. ENTER separates the base number from the second number.
Type in 57.5.
Press the percentage key.
The calculation renders a 6.122 percent loss.
 For example, the basic keystrokes you would use to calculate simple interest on a $500 loan for 120 days with a 5 percent interest rate are:


Type in 120n, where n stores the value for the term of the loan.
Type in 5i, where i stores the value for the interest rate, which in this example is 5 percent.
Enter 500 CHS PV, which stores the principle.
Press f INT to calculate the accrued interest. In this example, it is $8.33.
Press + to calculate the total amount owed (principle plus accrued interest). The total is $508.33.
 Regardless of the complexity of the equation, you must enter data in the correct sequence to render accurate results. Be aware that calculator set-ups can vary slightly from 1 model to the next.

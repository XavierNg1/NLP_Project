 This is the fun part and it's totally up to you which chocolate box you'll use. The only requirement is that the chocolates inside the box come in either their own little cupcake-style holders or there is a blister pack with pre-formed chocolate shapes inside.;
, Lift off the lid with care; keep everything looking as pristine as possible.
 This is the hardest step because you have to do something with those chocolates. Like eat them...


Keep all of the original paper/foil/plastic holders in place; only remove the chocolates.

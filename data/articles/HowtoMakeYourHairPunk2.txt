 You can cut your hair yourself, or you can visit a stylist. Additionally, you can model your haircut after someone else's style, or freehand it in the moment. Decide what works best for you.
 The scissors hair stylists use are sharper and easier to handle than regular scissors. If you're undertaking a complicated haircut, purchase a pair of shears at your local beauty supply store.
 Many punk hairstyles feature a shaved portion of the head. If you're planning on shaving part of your hair off, and you plan to maintain the style over a long period, buy a decent electric shaver. Find a setting you like and touch up your hair every week or two.


An electric shaver is also a convenient way to trim fuzzy neck hairs that might be visible when you put your hair in a mohawk. Keeping your hairline clean will make sure the attention stays on your hairstyle.
 If you're going to re-do your color and you notice your ends looking a little ragged, trim them. Damaged hair will absorb more dye and can be a significantly different color than you intended.

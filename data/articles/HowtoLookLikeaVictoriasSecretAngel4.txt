If you have an athletic body, try a halter neck bra with matching thong.
If you're busty, look for fashionable underwire options and pair them with high waisted briefs.
If you're short waisted, look for low-rise bikinis.
If your body is wider on top, try a baby-doll chemise.
If you have a small chest, try a racerback bralette., Angels are used to working it on the runway, so it stands to reason that off the runway, they look for clothing that is comfortable, while still being stylish.Look for skinny jeans and boyfriend jeans that make your legs look long and lean.
Look for fun basics, like leggings and tunics, that you can easily mix and match.
 Sunglasses are functional – they protect your skin from the sun and keep fans from recognizing you on the street – but they’re also very stylish and add some sophistication to even the most casual of outfits.Look for classic styles, like aviators and half-frame sunglasses.
If you're wearing a show-stopping pair of sunglasses, choose a subdued outfit to balance them out.

 This can be a good opportunity to involve family and friends in the wedding preparations. If you are involving others in the assembly process, be sure to provide a completed invitation as an example. Depending on your invitation, assembly simply may involve putting printed invitations in envelopes; or it may require mounting printed invitations on cardstock, adding enclosures and embellishments, and then placing invitation suites in envelopes.

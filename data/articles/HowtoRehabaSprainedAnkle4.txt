 Because sprains are injuries to ligaments, your ability to balance on your injured ankle may be decreased. This can make it easier to roll the ankle and re-injure it. Do an increasingly difficult balance test, starting at level one. Try to hold your balance by standing on your injured foot for 60 seconds, doing 6 repetitions a day. Once you can accomplish this, move to the next level. If you lose your balance, keep practicing at that level until you can do it.The levels are:

Level one: keep your arms out to your sides with your eyes open
Level two: fold your arms across your chest, and keep your eyes open
Level three: keep your arms out to your sides and close your eyes
Level four: fold your arms across your chest, and close your eyes

, Place a pillow on the floor. Stand on the pillow on your injured leg. Hold this for 10 seconds, rest, and repeat it 10 times. Be careful that you do not fall as you do this activity., Stand on your injured leg. Loop a resistance band around your uninjured leg, with the ends tied to a stable object. Pull your uninjured leg forward and back while balancing on your injured leg. Do this 10 times. Start slowly and get gradually faster as you get more comfortable.For a challenge, swing your uninjured leg behind you and then back.

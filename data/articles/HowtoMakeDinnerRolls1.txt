 Heat until the temperature reaches 120 to 130° F (50 to 55° C). Check the temperature with an instant read thermometer. Don't have a thermometer? The water is ready about a minute after it hits the definitely-hot-but-I'm-not-burning-myself stage.


At 120° the water is touchable. At about 130°, it hits the point where you can't touch it without burning yourself.You want it somewhere in that frame.;
, You know -- one of those ones with a dough hook, like a KitchenAid. It can be done without one, but your forearms are gonna be aching in the morning. That dough hook will make everything much easier.
 On low speed, combine the dry ingredients until they are well combined.
 Make sure the egg is fully incorporated into the dough.
 The dough should be slightly sticky or tacky, only lightly sticking to your fingers when you touch it.
 This should take about 5 minutes. Obviously it'll take longer if you're doing it by hand.
 Leave it to rise for about 10 minutes on the counter or on top of the stove. A "warmish" spot is ideal.
 For the bread to adequately rise in the oven, it needs to go through two rounds of rising beforehand.
 To make old-fashioned pan rolls, pinch off dough the size of a small ball, comfortably fitting in the palm of your hand. Roll the ball of dough between your hands until rounded perfectly.


Continue until all the dough is shaped into dinner rolls of roughly the same size. This recipe should warrant 12-15 rolls.
 You want them to almost double in size -- which should take about 30 to 45 minutes. While you're waiting for this, preheat the oven to 375° to 400°F (190° to 200°C).
 Then, if you'd like, take them out of the oven and brush the tops with melted butter for extra flavor and softness. And then serve almost immediately.


Brush with butter if you'd like, not take them out of the oven if you'd like. Well, you could keep them in the oven, but then you'd never be able to eat them, so where's the fun in that?

 First, you need to know that a game master is an actual job. As fun as it sounds, becoming a GM is a full-time desk job. Not everyone can instantly become a GM just because they've played the game for months on ends. Becoming a GM is not simply all about playing games.;
, You need to know if you meet the basic requirements:


Since it’s an office work, you need to be at least 18 years old before you can apply or be hired by Blizzard Entertainment.
Because you’d be dealing with online players, you need to have excellent customer services skills. Some of the job requirements require you to have a degree or, at least, a certification, but having the knowledge about the game’s concept, rules, and mechanics is much more important.
World of Warcraft is open to international players, so having the ability to speak a second language can prove to be very helpful, especially if the job description requires it.
Note that requirements for a GM post vary depending on what the company needs, so make sure to read the job description first before you apply.
 Write a resumé that highlights your skills, knowledge, and interest with the game. If you have any previous customer service experience, then you include it too.


The application form should be written in English, but if the job requires the use of another language apart from English, then it would be great to create resumés in both languages.
 Head to Blizzard Entertainment’s website’s career section (http://sea.blizzard.com/en-sg/company/careers/). When a new game master position is available, Blizzard will post it here together with the job description and all the requirements needed.


Once you see a GM job posting, click on “Apply Online” to send in your résumé.
 If you’re shortlisted for the position, Blizzard will contact you to ask more about you and probably setup a scheduled interview.


If you pass all the assessment, you can now become a full-time WoW game master.

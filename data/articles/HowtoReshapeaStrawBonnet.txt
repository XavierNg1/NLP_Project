 You'll need a medium-sized glass bowl, plenty of hot, boiling water, the bonnet, and a clean counter.
 You'll reshape the bonnet by using the water's steam, so make sure the water is thoroughly boiling before you use it.
 Nearly all the steam should be entering the hat.
 Place a clean cloth from the uncovered bowl to the brim to ensure efficient usage of the steam.
 Leave it over the steam for as long as the bonnet needs it and as long as you have time. If you're busy you can always return to steaming the bonnet later.


If the steam dies down before you've made much progress, add more boiling water to the bowl.

 The esssentials you need for the audition are:


Point and ballet shoes ( If you're doing ballet )
Jazz shoes ( for jazz )
Resume
Headshot and Full-body shot ( if it's required ).
, It's very helpful for picking out courses you're trying out for. For example, they have a ballet division that shows you information on it. Such as, the credit amount (6), how long it takes ( Full Year ), and Faculty. Then it gives a brief summary of the class. In this one it says:


"A graded study of the exercises and vocabulary of the classical technique with a strong emphasis on placement, alignment, coordination, and movement quality. Pointe work is optional for women. All men are required to take both classical and modernâ€™s partnering."

 Part of becoming more comfortable around him is going out of your way to spend more quality time with him. Make plans with him in settings that feel comfortable to you, whether you hang out one-on-one or with a group.
 Take time to get to know him better so that you have a better understanding of who he is as a person.


“What is your favorite memory from your childhood?”
“What is your family like?”
“What is your favorite thing about your family?”
“What is your favorite genre of music?”
“What do you do when you feel too stressed out?”
“If money were no object, what would you do with your life? Why?”
“If you could go on a vacation to anywhere in the world, where would you go? Why?”
“Have you traveled much? Where have you gone?”
“What is your favorite hobby?”

, Another contributing factor to your nervousness around him might be that you are still trying to put on a certain persona. When he asks you questions about yourself, be sure to answer honestly. Not only will this build trust, but it will also give you the opportunity to be yourself and allow him to like you for who you really are.


It is never a good idea to build a relationship on secrets and lies. Think about how you would feel if you found out that he lied to you about himself.
 Both of you will feel more at ease when your dates are planned around something with which you both already feel comfortable.


Go see a movie you both enjoy.
Go to a concert for a band or artist you both like.
Play a board or video game that you both love.
Attend a group date with mutual friends.

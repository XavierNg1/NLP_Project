 If you want to remove blackheads naturally, it's important to separate the astringent cleaners from the gentle cleaners to keep your skin as healthy as possible. It's likely you'll want to avoid harsh, alcohol-based cleaners, as well as chemical-based commercial cleansers.


It's also important to be gentle with your skin as you wash. Don't pick at your blackheads, or scrub your skin vigorously. Only use gentle scrubbing, even if you're exfoliating. You don't need to dig at your skin to keep it clean.
 Done properly and applied in the correct way, home remedies can be crafted using a wide variety of ingredients that are effective at tightening, soothing, and exfoliating your skin, making your skin more inhospitable to blackheads.
 Using natural-based moisturizers is essential to healthy skin. While many associate oiliness with blackheads, it's true that using excessive products that dry out your skin will actually end up making your skin oilier in the long run. Remember to moisturize regularly with natural plant-based oils and moisturizers to keep your skin healthy.
 Again, this can't be overstressed. Do not squeeze, strip, or pick at your blackheads. They cannot be removed entirely or permanently, and attempting to do so is bad for your skin. However, skin specialists may sometimes use a comedone remover, which is available in surgical supply stores; this applies pressure only around the comedone with minimal pressure, so the rest of the skin does not get damaged.
 Coconut oil contains medium chain fatty acids, which are bactericidal and kill acne bacteria. They also function as a natural moisturizer and prevent comedones from forming. Buy organic coconut oil and use a thin film on your face once a day., It has been known for decades that only people in civilized countries come down with comedones and acne. In native populations of Brazil and Japan where food is eaten containing no milk products, sugar and starchy foods, there is no acne.

 Disney follows strict safety rules, and will only begin the ride once every person is seated. There is no need to run to get to a particular seat. Every seat on most rides have the same vantage points.;
, Make sure to do this, right after getting in.
 Listen to them! Some seats have more harder-enforced sides, as well as a better center of gravity.
,, On some rides, the ride attendant will ask you to lower it yourself, while some may automatically lower without any single force exerted.


Do not block the bar from coming down onto you by any means, by putting any item on your lap (including children or other items).
Don't allow smaller children to sit on a bigger child's laps. Unless told to do differently by the station attendant otherwise, only keep one person per seating area. Failure to do so, could cause the safety-bar to malfunction and the ride to completely not leave the station entrance

, Not only do some rides have turns that could could cause the rider to not experience a sudden change that could confusingly cause your brain to misinterpret this change, but doing so could cause you to choke.

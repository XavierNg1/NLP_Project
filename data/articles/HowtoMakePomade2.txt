 To begin making this medium hold hair pomade, place a double broiler on the stovetop over medium heat. Place one inch (2.54 cm) of water in the bottom of the double broiler and place the top pan back on the double broiler.If you don’t have a double broiler, place a pot on the stovetop and add an inch (2.54 cm) of water to the bottom. Then place another pot or a heatproof bowl sitting on top of the bottom pot.
 Place the 3 tablespoons (44.36 ml) of shea butter and 2 tablespoons (29.57 ml) of beeswax pastilles into the top pan of the double broiler and mix them with a large spoon until they are melted., In a separate bowl, add the jojoba oil, arrowroot powder and the vitamin E if you are using it. Stir them together until all the ingredients are mixed together.Vitamin E promotes hair growth and also helps to strengthen hair. You can find liquid Vitamin E at some health food stores.
Arrowroot is a thickening agent. It can be bought in health food stores or some major supermarkets. You can also substitute cornstarch for arrowroot powder if you have trouble finding it.
 Take the double broiler off the heat and pour the jojoba oil mixture into the top of the double broiler with the shea butter mixture., Add in 10 drops of the essential oil of your choice, then mix the pomade ingredients together with a whisk or hand mixer for two or three minutes until the texture of the pomade is thick.You don’t need to use essential oils, but they can add a nice scent to your pomade.
 Once you add the essential oils, scoop or pour the pomade into a jar or tin with a top, being sure to scrape out the broiler to get out all the pomade. The pomade should be ready to use as soon as it cools.

 Use a search engine to find one and enter your full VIN. Remember to use capital letters.


Follow the instructions below if you want to calculate it yourself instead.
Shady used car salesmen sometimes replace VIN stickers to hide a history of damage. Using an online calculator can quickly confirm whether it's a lazy fake, but a smart criminal will use a real sticker from a similar model. This is where you can compare the VIN in the door to the VIN on the dash or on other body components to see if major components have been replaced with used parts or mismatched parts, indicating wrecks or rebuilds.
 The 9th character is a "check character" mandatory in North America but commonly used elsewhere in the world as well. This character can be used in a mathematical calculation to determine whether the VIN is fake, and has no other purpose.



Note: The check character will always be a number or the letter X. If it is a different letter, either the VIN was fake, the car was made before 1980 and uses a different standard, or the car was made outside North America and, unusually, the makers decided not to follow the check digit standard.
Write down the 9th character now to check at the end of the calculation, or find it again afterward.
 The first step involves replacing each letter in your VIN with a number that can be used in a calculation. Use the following system, and keep the characters in the same order as you replace them.For instance, if your VIN begins AK6, you should rewrite it as 126.


A and J become 1
B, K, and S become 2
C, L, and T become 3
D, M, and U become 4
E, N, and V become 5
F and W become 6
G, P, and X become 7
H and Y become 8
R and Z become 9
If there is an I, O, or a Q in your VIN, it is fake. Real VINs never use these letters, due to how easy it is to mistake them for a number. You can skip the rest of this method, as you already know the VIN isn't real.
 Leave plenty of space between each digit as well as below the number. Consider turning a sheet of paper sideways so you have the room to write it in one line.
 Keep the exact order listed. Note that "10" is one number, and should only go below a single digit.
 Each digit in the top row will be multiplied by the number directly beneath it. Write the results of each problem separately; do not turn them into one long number. Here's an example:


A (fake) VIN with letters turned into numbers as described above: 4 2 3 2 2 6 3 4 2 2 6 3 2 0 0 0 1
The series of numbers to multiply: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 10 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2
Multiply 4 x 8 (the first number in each line) to get 32. Multiple 2 x 7 (the second number) to get 14. Continue until you get the following results: 32;14;18;10;8;18;6;40;0;18;48;21;12;0;0;0;2.
 Add every number you got from the multiplication step together to get one number.


Continuing the example above, we get 32+14+18+10+8+18+6+40+0+18+48+21+12+0+0+0+2 = 247.
 Don't calculate this division problem out to the decimal point, only to the whole number. You can use a calculator, long division or work it out in your head.


'Note": If the remainder is "10", write down an "X" instead.
Using the example above, 247 / 11 = 22 remainder 5. Write down 5.
If you're using a calculator that gives you the answers in decimals, and you're not sure how to find the remainder, use an online remainder caculator instead.
 If this is the same as the remainder you wrote down, the VIN is real. Otherwise, the VIN is probably fake. The VIN is definitely fake in this case if the car it belongs to was made in North America after 1980.


Note that, if the remainder is 10, the matching 9th digit of a real VIN will be "X", since the manufacturer can't use a two digit number (10) as a checking number.
In our example above, the fifth digit of the original VIN is 2 but our remainder is 5. These numbers are not the same, so the VIN must be fake.

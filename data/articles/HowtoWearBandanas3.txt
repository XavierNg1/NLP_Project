 To wear a bandana as a bracelet, fold the bandana in half along the diagonal to create a triangle shape, then fold the top corner of the triangle over to touch the base of the triangle.Start to fold the bandana lengthwise to create a band that is about 3 inches (7.62 cm) thick. Wrap the band around your wrist, then make a knot to secure it, making sure to not tie the bandana on too tightly. Fold the ends underneath the knot if you don’t want them hanging down.
 Wearing a bandana around your thigh gives you a cool rock and roll vibe, whether it be over a pair of paints or around your bare leg when you are wearing shorts. Begin by folding the bandana to create a 3 inch (7.62 cm) band as you would for a bracelet or classic headband. Then tie the band across your thigh and knot it, either keeping the ends of the knot out in the front or swinging the knot around to the back and tucking in the ends.
 Though it’s not an especially common way to wear a bandana, a bandana around your ankle over a nice pair of shoes is a casual and stylish way to give your outfit some color. Fold the bandana into a 3 inch (7.62 cm) band as you would for a classic headband or a bandana bracelet, then tie the bandana around your ankle with the tie in the back.Wear cropped or cuffed pants to show off your bandana.

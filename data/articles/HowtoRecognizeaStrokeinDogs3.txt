 A stroke is caused by an interruption to the blood flow to part of the brain. It is a hallmark of strokes that they have a sudden onset, because of the sudden nature of a blood clot switching off the blood supply to part of the brain. The exact symptoms depend on which precise area of the brain is affected, but there are several symptoms held in common, no matter where the blood clot lodges.A stroke is almost always caused by a blood clot which lodges and causes obstruction in the blood vessel, but it is also possible that it's caused by a plug of fat that has dislodged and circulated to the brain. A stroke can even be caused by a plug of bacteria in the brain.
For many years there was dispute amongst veterinarians about whether animals had strokes or not. But this argument has now been largely won by the "yes they do happen" camp, because sophisticated imaging techniques, such as MRI scans, have produced pictures of the blockages in the brain., Those dogs most at risk are often older, and have pre-existing health condition such as heart disease, high blood pressure, or Cushing's disease. Some veterinarians anecdotally report that dogs with underactive thyroid glands are at increased risk of stroke, but the data to prove this is lacking.
 Other problems that can predispose a dog to a stroke include heartworm, where larvae can break off and circulate to the brain to cause a blockage. Also at risks are dogs with a history of clotting problems, with kidney disease, a high fever, or cancer.The lowest risk group for stroke are young, fit dogs with no health problems that are regularly treated against heartworm.
 Be aware that a stroke in a dog has a different presentation to in people. Whereas a person may be affected down one side of their body and their speech may be affected, this is not the case with dogs. They present in the ways described above.

 There are online marketplaces that work by helping you search for something and referring you to the actual online merchant when you’re ready to make a purchase. These websites are called online shopping portals, or OSPs. The merchant provides a kickback to the OSP, and the OSP provides you with an incentive - such as travel rewards - for using their portal. Often, frequent flyer programs or hotel rewards programs have their own OSPs. This means you can shop through their website to earn extra rewards on any purchases you make.
If you also use an rewards program-affiliated credit card to complete the purchase, you’ll be earning points on the transaction itself too - thus double dipping on your rewards.
 Some credit cards offer certain rewards for certain types of purchases. If, for instance, you like to eat out, it’s likely worth getting a rewards card that gives you double points on restaurant purchases. Within the card's rewards network, you can often specify a preferred loyalty program. In fact, your rewards program may even reward you for linking the card to their program.As such, you can make “double” rewards by using the credit card where it earns double points and assigning them to a frequent flier program.
Further, the frequent flier program may reward you with extra points if it is affiliated with the place you made the purchase. In this sense, you can even triple your rewards!

, Often, you can earn extra rewards towards the program your credit card is affiliated with by spending a certain amount within a certain time frame. In these instances, it’s not the type of purchase you make or where you make a purchase, it’s simply the amount that matters.The most common example is a welcome bonus, for which you might receive a certain amount of bonus rewards for spending a certain amount on your card within your first month.

 Channel your energy towards someone else. If you see him or her struggling through something you can use energy to help him or her.;
, If you place your hand on a place where you are hurt, all the energy currently in your body will flow through that spot. Just focus on the place and feel the energy flowing through your hand. Then you will have a warm feeling and the pain will subside.
 Normally when you try to move any energy you use the energy that is already inside your body. If you do that for the first time in a long time you probably will not feel a lot of effects. Therefore you will need an external energy source. The easiest way to do this is ask the nature around you to send you energy, you can do this by just thinking: "energy, can I please use you to do X".


Now X needs to be something positive, like healing or helping someone else doing something. The rule is: if you want to use the energy for something bad you will get negative energy. This will make your life more chaotic. Now if you want to do something good you will gain positive energy.

;
, Either grate into large pieces or use a carrot peeler to make very long lengths. Leave aside a small piece of carrot for making the hen's comb and beak.



To make the comb, cut a small round carrot slice, then cut in half. Cut one edge zig-zagged.
For the beak, simply cut a small half circle of a thin, round carrot slice.
, Cut a small slit along the top of the egg and slide the straight edge into it to hold. The zig-zagged edge should be facing upward.
 Cut a small slit where the beak should be. Slide the beak in - one end of the semi-circle should slide into the egg slit and the other sticks out, looking like a beak.
, Place the lettuce pieces down first. Then arrange the grated or peeled carrot lengths around the middle like a nest.
 It's now ready for serving.

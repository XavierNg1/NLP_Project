 In pai gow poker, as in some other poker games, the joker is a limited wild card, or "bug." It may be treated as an ace, or used to fill out a straight, flush or straight flush.


Some casinos allow the joker to be completely wild.;
, Unlike other poker games, there are no calls or raises, although there may be side bets.
 The remaining cards are discarded.
 Starting with himself or herself, the dealer counts clockwise around the table up to the number rolled on the dice. That player gets first choice of the stacks; then the remaining players get to choose, going counterclockwise.


If there are fewer than 7 players, some casinos assign the leftover stacks to "dragon" hands, particularly when there is only a single empty seat.
 The banker is the person whose hands must be beaten to win the round. If none of the players wish to be the banker, that role falls to the house (dealer).


The advantage in serving as the banker is that the banker wins all "copies" or ties. The disadvantage is that the banker has to arrange his or her cards according to the rules the house uses for its dealer's hand. Many casinos also require a player who serves as banker to have enough money to cover the other players' bets.
Some casinos allow a player to share banking duties with the house, sharing half of the proceeds or losses, provided the player builds his or her hands the house way.
Some casinos also require a player to have played against the house once before being allowed to serve as banker.
If one of the players serves as banker, the dealer makes a bet for the house equal to the amount that player last bet when the house served as banker.

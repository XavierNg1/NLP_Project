 To throw a punch with your right hand, place your left leg in front of you and your right leg back. Your knees should be slightly bent.
 As you gain momentum, make sure your body is relaxed. It will increase your momentum and the force of your hit.
 The temple is the area on the side of a person's face, between the hairline and the eyebrows, at eye level. If the temple is accurately targeted, the punch will cause the brain to swing violently against the skull lining, causing a blackout., It's sometimes easier to use the palm of your hand for hitting, but in this case a fist is more accurate. Aiming at the side of the person's face, and hitting them from the side, is extremely hard to do with force when only using the palm.
 Generate more force with a hit by twisting your hips while you move into the target. If you want to put more force into your swing, be sure to use your hips as well as your arms.

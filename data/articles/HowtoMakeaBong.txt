, This hole is where the smoke will enter the bong from your bowl and stem. (The tighter the hole is around the stem, the less tape or sealant you will need. This takes finesse!)








, This could be a metal pipe, a hollowed out pen tube, or a stem bought at a store or online. Make sure it's at a positive angle, or else your herbs will get wet.
 If it's not completely airtight than your smoke will go out of the holes where it's not supposed to! To fix this use either gum (works best) or tape. To test that it's airtight, put your hand really close to the seal, and blow through the mouthpiece. If you feel air coming out, it's not airtight. You can use a rubber grommet to make it more airtight (see Tips)








, If you can, pick up an inexpensive glass bowl from your local smoke shop, they will usually run about 5 dollars. You can also roll a cigarette with rolling papers and attach it to the end of the tube. Aluminum foil can be used but it is not recommended. Please check to make sure your bowl material is safe for inhalation before using.
 You can fill it with more, but there will be less smoke in the chamber when you smoke. Make sure you don't put too much water, if you do it will drown your herb!








, The hole shown in this picture is in a ridiculously high place and would not allow the smoke to mix with the air being let in. This will allow oxygen into the chamber.
, Exhale.

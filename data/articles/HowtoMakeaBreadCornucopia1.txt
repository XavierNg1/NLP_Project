 A good tip is to use a plastic bottle as a basic guide for making the cone. Shapes can vary; a two-liter bottle will make a bigger mold, while a smaller water bottle will make a much smaller one. Use sheets of foil to wrap around the bottle until the foil is thick and sturdy enough to hold some weight.
 The shape shouldn't be too curvy, however, just the end; otherwise, it will be hard to take out of the bread when you're done. Stuff the horn with balls of foil for extra resilience and to keep the shape intact., Pizza dough works well, since it hardens well to keep the shape once you're done baking. You'll want to /lightly/ grease the foil on the outside before you start layering the strips as well., Just strap them around and make them overlap slightly for the best result. If you feel like getting creative, you can always weave and curl the pieces of dough any way you like, as long as you cover the entire foil shape. For the lip of the cornucopia, you can braid three strips of dough to give it a nice finish., To do this, just beat one or two eggs with a whisk (until fluffy) and paint over the dough., Check on the baking process frequently, to make sure that the cornucopia doesn't burn. If some areas are getting more baked than others, a strip of foil on that area can keep it from getting too brown., Allow to cool down for approximately half an hour, or until it can hold its shape., Slowly and carefully remove the foil from the bread once it has completely cooled down. You will be left with an empty bread horn., It is good for adding fruit, veggies or anything else edible and dry. Add some sprigs of rosemary if you prefer to scent the bread and decorate it.

Do not add moist or wet food, as the bread will break down.
 Enjoy your masterpiece.

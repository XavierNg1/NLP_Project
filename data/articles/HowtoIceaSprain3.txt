 Simply fill a cup with water and add some ice cubes into it. This method is more effective than placing an icepack over the sprain, as the cold water surrounds the entire finger and injury., Leave your finger in the water for 15 minutes.
 Try to elevate your sprained finger and hand while soaking it in the ice water. This will help reduce swelling., Once the swelling goes away, you may wrap your finger with some medical tape.Always tape the sprained finger to the adjacent finger, even if the adjacent one is not injured. Tape ring fingers and pinky fingers together, and pointer fingers and index fingers together.
If you have sprained your thumb, continue wrapping the adhesive bandage around your hand and wrist.

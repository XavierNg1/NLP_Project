 It can be dangerous to take up archery if you have not been trained properly or do not know technique.;
, They will help you find an appropriate draw weight and size of the bow.
,, Turn the bow to the side and notch the arrow. Once a bow has been given to you, place an appropriate size arrow on the string before placing your index finger above the arrow, and the middle and ring finger beneath, only holding on with the distal phalanx, leaving the small finger away.


Arrows must be as long as your arm, reaching down to about an inch (2.5cm) past your thumb.
Be sure to put the arrow on the arrow rest if your bow is equipped with one.
 This may affect where your arrow goes.
 Draw back so that the tip of the string is on the tip of your nose and your hand under your jawbone.


You can draw back the arrow to whatever spot on your face you feel most comfortable with. Preferably, your chin, cheek, or jawbone notch.
, You should be able to look down the shaft of the arrow, but always be looking at where you want your arrow to go.


If the arrow is not in the center, then adjust the sight, following the arrow. For example, the arrow is too far right so move your sight to the right.
 When the red spot is on the middle, release, sliding your fingers away.
 Watch the arrow wend its way to target and hope that you hit it.
 If you persevere, perhaps one day you will be an Olympic champion (or at least be pretty good)!

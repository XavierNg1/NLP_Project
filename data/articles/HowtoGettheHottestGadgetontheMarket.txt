 Find all you local electronic/hardware dealers that are close to you. Be sure to write down their company name, phone number, address, and opening and closing hours.;
,,


For pre-orders:

Place an order for your device over the phone. Be sure to record down the date it will be ready to be picked up.


For purchasing at the store:

If purchasing on the launch date, ask if they are expecting to have their devices to be sold out quickly. If so be prepared to camp out at the store in the line.
If purchasing after the launch date, ask if they have any in stock. If they do not ask when they are expecting to receive their next shipment, and be sure to record that date.
 Certain devices will go fast. It may be necessary to "camp-out" in the lines.
 Have your method of payment ready, so lines will move faster.

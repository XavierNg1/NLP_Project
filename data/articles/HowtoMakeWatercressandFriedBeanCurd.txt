 Drain it, wrap it in three to four layers of paper towels, and gently hug it with your hands to get rid of extra unwanted moisture. Then, lay your tofu in a large bowl and press down with your palm, fingers spread out.  Press on the tofu a few times (switching directions) to create large clumps, but try to avoid having it look like milk vomit.
  The best way to do this is to put your watercress in a large bowl filled with water, then gently press down several times, and take it out onto a colander. Submerge the watercress a second time in a large bowl of cold water, but carefully inspect them as you take them out. Discard anything unpleasant. Make sure you don't cook up any slugs, weeds, or hard old stems.,, Let it heat up and start frying your garlic and onions. As they start to turn yellow, add your tofu.  Leave the tofu in the pan about 30 seconds before stirring. Continue stirring every 30 seconds until your tofu has dried and turned into a deep yellow. You want the tofu to cook, but you want to avoid having it look too crumbly. Add a few pinches of salt and pepper and give it another good stir. It's done when the tofu has turned light brown, and almost or completely crispy, but not burnt!, Try to separate it into two equal parts. Put in the first bunch, add a dash of soil sauce, stir and cover for one minute. Add the second bunch and a dash of soy sauce, stirring it into the bottom of the pan. Cover for two to three minutes. Take out the cover and gently stir everything together. Turn off the heat, throw your dry chilies on top, and cover for about another minute or two before serving.

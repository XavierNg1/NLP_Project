 This can usually be done with one full rotation of the hand-wheel on the side of the machine. Do this so that your needle won't be flailing wildly while you wind the bobbin.

, The bobbin is a small spool that is located under the sewing needle in your machine. It supplies the underside portion of the machine stitch, but doesn’t come prepared with thread. Remove the covering above the bobbin and take it out of its case; it should be empty of thread.
 Place your spool of thread on the top of the sewing machine, on the spool pin. The spool should be turned so that the thread is released counter-clockwise.
 Tug at the thread to pull it out, and wind it around the bobbin winding tension disc at the top of the sewing machine. If you have a newer sewing machine, there will likely be a diagram at the top guiding you through this process.
 Hold the bobbin up and wrap the thread around it 2-3 times.
 This is a small pin that is likely on the top of your machine. Slide the pin over to lock the bobbin in place for winding.
 As you hold the longer thread entering the bobbin, start winding the bobbin for a few seconds by pushing the floor pedal or press the bobbin winding button. Doing this will make sure the thread is securely wrapped around the bobbin. Then, cut off the excess thread on the short tail end that is sticking out.
 Apply pressure to the floor pedal again or flip the winder back on and allow it to completely fill the bobbin with thread. Likely, your winder will stop on its own when the bobbin is full; the bobbin should still be able to spin easily when full.
 Slide the bobbin pin over and remove the bobbin. The thread will still be attached to the thread spool as well as the bobbin, so cut the excess with a pair of scissors, leaving a 2–3 inch (5.1–7.6 cm) tail. You’re ready to start threading your machine now!

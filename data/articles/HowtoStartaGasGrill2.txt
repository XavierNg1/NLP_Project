 With the lid closed, potentially dangerous explosive gas won’t have a chance to build up. Hook up your gas by attaching the gas line to the gas output, like a tank, and the input, like a connector on the back or side of the grill.


Gas inputs and outputs are usually preceded or followed by a shutoff valve and are frequently shaped like spigots., On the connector that’s linking your gas supply to your grill there should be a shutoff valve. Open this fully to supply gas to your grill. Wait a few minutes after opening the valve to give the gas enough time to fill the line., Place a match in the lighting hole. This should be a small hole located on the grill’s side. Open the regulator for the burner closest to the lighting hole fully. Light the first match already in the lighting hole with a second match. The turned on burner should light.


After your first burner lights, it’s a simple matter to turn on the regulator knobs for the other burners. They should light off the flame already burning in your grill.
Some models of grill may not have lighting holes or might have poorly designed ones. In this case, stand as far from the grill as you can and use a long stick match to light the grill.

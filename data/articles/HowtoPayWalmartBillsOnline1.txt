 If you want to pay your Walmart bill online, you need to create an account with Walmart's bill pay system. The process is fairly easy and should not take too long.


Go to Walmart's website and click the "My Account" tab near the top right corner of the page.This should bring you to a page that asks you to create an account if you do not have one. First, enter name and e-mail address. Then, create a password. Your password should not be a dictionary word and should include a combination of lower case letters, capital letters, and numbers. For example, say you have three dogs named Bonnie, Murphy, and Scout and you were born in 1992. A easy to remember password would be BoMuSc92.Once you've entered your information, you simply click "Create An Account." As long as there are no issues with your e-mail, name, or password your account should be created successfully.;
, Once you've created your account, log in. Enter your e-mail and the password you just created. If you've just created your account, you may have to confirm your e-mail. You can do this by logging into your e-mail and checking for a e-mail from Walmart. You'll probably have to click on a link in the e-mail to confirm.
 Once you've logged into your account, you can pay your bill by clicking on the e-payment link. You need a valid checking account from a US bank to use e-pay. You will need the following information:


Bank name
Checking account number
Bank routing number, which are the first nine numbers at the left bottom of your checks, Once you've entered the necessary information, your payment should go through as long as it was all entered correctly. It will take 2 to 3 to process so don't be surprised if the money isn't immediately removed from your account.

 Lay out your bandana. You want a square bandana in order to make this kind of fold. Take the corner closest to you (the bottom corner) and fold it up so that the point hits the center of the bandana.








If you have a smaller bandana, make this fold smaller—don’t make it reach to the center. This will give you more fabric to stretch over your head.
 Holding your bandana on each corner of the fold, place across your forehead. Make sure the small piece of fabric you folded is on the inside. Move your hands outwards toward the two side corners, pulling them toward the back of your head. The top corner of the bandana will be on top of your head.








If it makes it easier, you can bend over forward to perform this step.
 Use the two side corners to tie a single knot at the back of your head. You want it tight enough so that it feels secure. Be careful not to make it too tight though, because it will be uncomfortable.
 Keep one hand on the knot you’ve created. Bring the top corner of the bandana over the top of your head and to the knot. Place it over your original knot and use your side corners to tie another single knot over this piece. This will catch the top corner in the middle of a secure double knot.
 You can hold on to the front and pull the knot to loosen your bandana. To tighten it, use both hands to tighten the knot as securely as possible. If you have longer ends than you wish, create a triple knot to shorten them.

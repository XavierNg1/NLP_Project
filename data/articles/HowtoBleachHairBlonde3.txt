 In a mixing bowl, mix one part toner to two parts volume 20 developer. The mixture will look blue. Remember to wear gloves to avoid getting the products on your hands.
 Use a clean tinting brush to cover your hair in toner in sections, exactly the same way you applied the bleach mixture. If you ended up with hot roots, pay special attention to those.
 Check the instructions on the bottle to determine exactly how long the toner should stay in your hair. It's usually approximately 30 minutes.
 Run your hair under water until the water runs clear. Use a shampoo made for bleached hair to make sure all the toner is removed.
 Use a deep conditioner for color treated hair. For the next few weeks, treat your hair carefully. Don't use too much heat, and avoid excess chemicals.

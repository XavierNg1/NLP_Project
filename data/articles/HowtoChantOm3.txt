 There are over 500 Om chanting groups around the world. Look for a group by searching online for “find an Om chanting group.” Or, enter your city or state and add the keywords “Om chanting group.” Facebook and Meetup are a couple of places you can find such groups locally.Look for Om chanting workshops where attendees sit in a circle and meditate together.
Look for yoga classes near you. Some yoga classes chant Om before and/or after each yoga session and some don’t, so call or email either the organization or the instructor, and ask if the group chants Om during class.
 Try to feel relaxed but confident so your voice doesn’t waver. Blend your voice with the chant of everyone so that it is one collective chant.Have an open mind about pronunciation. If the group pronounces “Om” in a different way than you’re used to, go with it. There is no incorrect way to pronounce “Om,” as it differs based on factors like dialect and location. The aim is for everyone to match in tone for a group chant.Approach the chant with a sense of reverence and surrender. This will help you to merge into the vibration of the group chant., Tell the participants that if they aren’t comfortable chanting, they can meditate silently during the chant, or simply listen. View chanting as a connection to the meaning of the chant, rather than a performance. Take a few breaths before chanting and summon the positive feeling of the chant.Try practicing alone before leading group chants.
Add instrumental background music for the group chant if desired. Alternately, you can bring a recorded group chant to play in the background.

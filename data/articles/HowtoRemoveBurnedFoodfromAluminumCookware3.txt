 Then add the salt in the water and mix it well. The amount of salt that you need varies depending on the size of your pan. If you have a 10-inch pan, then 4 teaspoons of salt should be good enough. After you are done mixing the salt in the water, let the pan soak for about 8-10 hours., You will see that burned foods start lifting already, and the water will turn into a darkish brown color. After about 15-20 minutes, turn your burner off and wait until the pan cools down. This should not take too much time., You should see that almost all of the stains are gone. All that is left are some stubborn smudges. No worries!, Now start cleaning all the smudges. All the leftovers should clean off pretty easily., Now you should have a like-new aluminum pan.

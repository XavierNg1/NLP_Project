If you want another member of your household to drop off your ballot for you, make sure that person also signs. The envelope will have a specific place for that person's signature.
Some counties require that the person dropping off your ballot must be a member of your household, so read the instructions on the ballot and the envelope carefully.
 Many counties now have pages where you can look up the status of your ballot. It may take a few days before your ballot shows up on such a website. If your county has no such website, phone them and ask, instead.

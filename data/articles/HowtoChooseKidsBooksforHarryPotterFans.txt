 You never know what your librarian can help you find. A public librarian or a school librarian could help you. Give them to the child and see if they like them. If they don't, then ask them why they didn't like them and try again, trying to avoid the books that the child has said that they don't like.;
, If so, they can be a big help in finding something else for a Harry Potter fan to read. Make sure that their child is around the same age as your child/they are around the same age as you, so you read books around the same difficulty.
 There are lots of them, but voracious readers can be picky about their books, so put some thought into it. Some good books to try for 8-13 year olds are:


Whispering to Witches -Anna Dale
Pure Dead series -Debi Gliori
Molly Moon series- (younger end of the scale) Georgia Byng
Inkheart Trilogy- Cornelia Funke
His Dark Materials series- (older end of the scale, for keen readers) Philip Pullman
For older readers (13+) try the Mortal Instruments series (Cassandra Clare) or the Twilight Saga (Stephanie Meyer). However, keep in mind that there are some parts of the books in these series that are inappropriate for readers in the younger end of the scale.
 Keep in mind that these books have been written by non-authors and some are not quite suitable for young children.
 These clubs read books like Harry Potter and canÂ be a lot of fun! They can also recommend good books for your child to read. If there are no clubs in your area, join online forums on book review sites like GoodReads to ask about good books for your child to read.
 You can try Percy Jackson and the Olympians (the main competition).
 Be aware that her adult book, 'The Casual Vacancy', could be considered inappropriate for young children. Try her Harry Potter linked books, 'The Tales Of Beedle The Bard' and 'Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them' instead.

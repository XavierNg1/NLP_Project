 Choose decorative items that you like and have freely available at home.


You can also add sequins, buttons, pieces of ribbon or lace, and so forth.
 The idea is to completely cover the notebook page, so that the original design can no longer be seen. Options for this include:


Stick rows of the same-sized stickers on the notebook.
Use images to make a decoupage or collage look.
Design an image and use the stickers or images to create the design (you can stick a piece of plain paper on first, for the background).
Write your name or another word in stickers or images.
Make a scene, such as a zoo, a field, a city street, inside a house, and so forth.
 Stick carefully so that the items won't come off easily when bumped or carried in your bag

, This step isn't necessary but it can help to prevent 'dog-ears', scratches and loose pieces after you've finished. A layer of Mod Podge, for example, can seal everything in nicely. Alternatively, stick neat rows of tape over it all, to create a splash-proof cover.
 You now have a new and more fascinating notebook.

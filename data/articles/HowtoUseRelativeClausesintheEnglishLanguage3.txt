 When writing a relative clause with a relative adverb, you’ll need a subject and a verb, as the relative adjective does not act as the subject of the clause.


Let’s begin with the same simple sentence: “George grills meat.” Once again, you have two nouns you can modify, “George” or “meat.” Let’s try describing “George.”
For instance, you could describe George by including information on when he grills meat: “George, when he feels hungry, grills meat.” The clause “when he feels hungry” is modifying George. In this clause, “he” is the subject, while “feels” is the verb.
 You can also modify the word “meat.”


As yourself when or where is the meat grilled? Let’s use “where”.For example: “George, when he feels hungry, grills meat where it can get smoky flavor.”
In this clause, “it” is the subject and “can get” is the verb. “Where it can get smoky flavor” is describing “meat,” as it tells where it is located.
 “Why” usually works a little differently from other relative adverbs. “Why” often ends up in the second half of the sentence, even though it describes the subject.


For instance, you could write, “George knows the reason why the meat is smoky.” In this sentence, “why the meat is smoky” is modifying “the reason.”
In fact, you will often use “why” clauses to modify “the reason,” even if it is only implied. The sentence above could read: “George knows why the meat is smoky.”

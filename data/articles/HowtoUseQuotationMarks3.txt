 Quotation marks are essential for notating dialogue, as they signal to the reader the words are being spoken. You should use quotation marks around dialogue in a novel, short story, or poem. For example:“Where is my cat?” the woman screamed.
I demanded, “Let me see her.”

, Always lowercase the word that follows the close quotation mark, or the second quotation mark. Do this if the speaker attribution appears after the quoted phrase. For example:

“What time is it?” the man asked.
“Chop, chop,” she said.
 Place a comma before speaker attributions like “he said,” “she said,” “they said,” “we yelled,” etc. This will signal to the reader there is about to be dialogue. For example:He said, “I can’t make ballet class tonight, son.”
They yelled, “You hooligans!”
“We’re late,” she said to her sister.
“Tell me you love me, “ he said to his lover.
 Any commas or periods that are part of the sentence should be included in the quotation marks, even if the original quotation does not have a comma or a period. For example:“The best way to eat food,” Pollen argues, “is to make it yourself.” (From the original quote, “The best way to eat food is to make it yourself at home, whenever you can.”)
“The best investments today,” according to Smith, “are commodities and emerging-market stocks.” (From the original quote, “The best investments today are commodities and emerging-market stocks, not domestic stocks and bonds.”

, If you are quoting a phrase that already has quotation marks, change the quotation marks in the phrase to single quotation marks. Single quotation marks appear as ‘’. For example:

“So he said to me, ‘You’re going to be a great success,’ and I believed him.”

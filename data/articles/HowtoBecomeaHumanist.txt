 Most humanists such as Corliss Lamont or Carl Sagan agree that humanity must seek the truth through reasoning and use of the scientific method to test hypotheses.;
, For example, the existence or nonexistence of immortal beings is outside the realm of humanism, which concerns itself with mortal human only., A humanist believes that through hard work, humans can do good and make life better for others.
 Focus on the present, not the past or the future. Aim to do good and live well now, and leave the world a better place for posterity. The welfare of humanity is the primary concern for a humanist.
 Because humans are the focus of humanism, a humanist will strive to determine right and wrong for himself. Avoid undue influence from others, superstitions, and prejudices.
 For a humanist, happiness is achieved by doing good and living well.Do good unto others, as you would have others do unto you.

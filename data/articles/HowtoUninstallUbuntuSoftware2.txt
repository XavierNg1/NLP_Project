 Software Center is a GUI package manager that can install and uninstall Linux software. In older versions of Ubuntu, Software Center is located in the Application menu. In later versions, you can find the Software Center in the Launcher, or by entering “software” into the Dash search field.
 In the left frame, click the Installed Software link. This will open a list of all the software currently installed on your system.
 Highlight the program that you wish to uninstall and click the Remove button that appears in the toolbar. You may be asked for your administrator password. After entering the password, the program will be automatically removed.


You can add more programs to the removal queue by selecting them and clicking the Remove button. Once the first program is finished uninstalling, the next program in the queue will begin.

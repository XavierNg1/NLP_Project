 Instead of having "BINGO" at the top of the cards, substitute it with "SOLVE" or "CRIME". Make it creative. Position the "FREE" space in the center of the board, two rows down from the third letter.;

, It's up to you to use the same keywords on every card or have different cards say other terms. This is useful when lots of terms are built up or allow people to have the opportunity to find different things from others.
 Make sure that everyone has enough time so that they know what they're looking for beforehand.
 If the cards won't be used in the future, you can have them cross them out with a marker. You can always preserve them for future games and use tokens or coins to cover them.
 Once a person's card is completely blacked out first, then a winner can be declared. Depending on the complexity of the keywords, people can complete a standard Bingo row or column (up, down, or diagonal).

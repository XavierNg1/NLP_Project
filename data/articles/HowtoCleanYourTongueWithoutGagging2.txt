 In either case, moisten the brush with water and rinse it periodically while cleaning. You want to clean your tongue thoroughly, but not make it bleed and/or cause short-term damage to your taste buds, so don’t use a hard-bristled brush or scrub too aggressively.You don’t need to add toothpaste, or any other product than water.
 Your natural inclination will probably be to brush in a parallel direction to your tongue — that is, from tip to back and back to tip. If you can do it this way without gagging, that’s fine; if not, consider circular or perpendicular techniques.Brushing in small, circular motions may allow you to ease further back on your tongue without engaging your gag reflex — as opposed to what happens when you’re jabbing the brush towards the back of your throat.
Perpendicular (or side-to-side) brushing also prevents the brush from poking towards the back of your throat. With this method, you’ll have more control over exactly how far back on your tongue the brush reaches., Antimicrobial rinses (like Listerine) may help further reduce mouth bacteria,but using plain, clean water to rinse out your mouth is perfectly acceptable. Remember that you’re trying to expel this loosened tongue bacteria, so spit out the water instead of swallowing it., Either pattern works equally well; the important thing is to clean both these parts of your mouth frequently. If you brush your tongue as often as you brush your teeth, you’ll reduce the amount of buildup you need to clean off.If your tongue feels raw or bleeds, give it a day or two to recover. Instead of reducing your cleaning frequency long-term, though, try not pressing as hard or find a softer brush (or a scraper).

 If you want to give up your baby and relinquish your parental rights at the same time, then you should contact an adoption agency. The agency can schedule an adoption and talk to you about your options.


To find an adoption agency near you, you can search the Internet for “adoption agency” and your city or county. You can also see Put a Child up for Adoption for more insight on how to choose an adoption agency.
If your child is older, then it may be harder to place the child up for adoption. You may have to contact your state’s Department of Child Protective Services if you find that you can no longer care for your child.
 You will need to sign a document giving up your parental rights.The document should be drafted by a lawyer for the adoption agency or by a private attorney that you hire.


Often, parents relinquish their parental rights where the other parent’s partner is willing to adopt the child. This adoption can happen at any time in the child’s life, not solely when the child is a baby. If this is the situation, then the other parent’s attorney could draft the affidavit for you. You then could meet with your own lawyer to review the affidavit and make any necessary corrections.
 If you are relinquishing your rights as part of an adoption, then your affidavit must be filed as part of the adoption action at a Superior Court where the child lives.You can let the other parent handle petitioning the court since the termination of your rights will happen at the same time as the adoption by the step-parent. However, you might want to ask the other parent to keep you updated on the case.
 You may have to attend a court hearing before your rights can be terminated. The judge may want to ask you questions in order to understand your reasons for the relinquishment and whether it is voluntary.Be sure to answer all questions completely and honestly. Call the judge “Your Honor” or “Judge” and stand when speaking.

 Add  1 cup (237 g) of borax, 1 cup (237 g) of washing soda, ½ cup (118. 5 g) of citric acid, and ½ cup (124 g) of kosher salt in a large bowl or pot. Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until it is well blended.Borax is a natural mineral that is often used in cleaning products. You can find it at most grocery and big box stores in the aisle where laundry or cleaning products are sold.
Washing soda is a water-soluble sodium salt of carbonic acid that works as a natural cleaner or cleaning booster. You can find it at many grocery and big box stores in the laundry or cleaning products aisle. If you can’t find it locally, it’s also available at online stores.
Citric acid is a natural compound found in citrus fruits that is an ideal disinfectant in cleaning products. You can find it in many grocery stores where canning or brewing supplies are sold, or at health food stores and pharmacies.
 Once the detergent mixture is fully combined, transfer it from the bowl or pot to a jar or jug with an airtight lid. To avoid spilling the detergent all over your work surface, you may find it easier to pour the mixture into the container with a funnel.The detergent may clump if it’s exposed to moisture, so try to keep in a cool, dark closet or pantry with low humidity.
 When you’re ready to wash a load of dishes, take 1 tablespoon (15 g) of the detergent mixture and place it in the detergent cup in your dishwasher. Run the dishwasher as you normally would.The recipe should make enough detergent for 48 loads of dishes.

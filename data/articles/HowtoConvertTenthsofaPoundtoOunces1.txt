 Your starting point should be a number like 5.75 pounds. The .75 denotes the tenths of a pound, so that's the part that you would be converting. Note that the number before the decimal, the 5, is your total number of whole pounds.;
, Make sure that you include the decimal. It will probably automatically add a zero, in which case your number will look something like 0.75 pounds.
 There are 16 ounces in every pound, so to convert from tenths of a pound to ounces, you just multiply by 16. The answer will be your total number of ounces.


0.75 times 16 ounces equals 12 ounces.
Note that to reverse this process, you simply have to divide by 16 rather than multiplying. So, if your original quantity is 5 pounds, 12 ounces, you could just divide 12 by 16 to get 0.75 pounds. Then add the 5 back in, and 5 + 0.75 equals a total of 5.75 pounds.
 The number of whole pounds from your original number is all the numbers to the left of the decimal. The number of ounces is the answer that you got when you multiplied the tenths of a pound by 16.


For the example of 5.75 pounds, the answer would be written 5 pounds, 12 ounces.

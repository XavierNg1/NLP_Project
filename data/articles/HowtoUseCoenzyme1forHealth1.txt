 People who suffer from energy-sapping disorders such as chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia may benefit from NADH supplements. Specifically, NADH is involved in the production of another chemical called ATP that your cells need to produce energy. Talk to your doctor about taking NADH in a treatment regimen if you suffer from fatigue, especially chronic fatigue syndrome.Your doctor may recommend taking niacin so that your body can make NADH. They may also recommend 10 mg of NADH daily with water on an empty stomach.Further research is being done on the potential for NADH supplements to assist those who are chronically fatigued.;
, Some of the drugs used to treat Parkinson’s may cause patients to have depleted levels of vitamin B3 (niacin). NADH supplements may also help remedy this depletion. Ultimately, NADH can help improve brain function in those with Parkinson’s disease, and thus reduce some of the disease’s symptoms.Talk to your doctor about taking NADH if you have Parkinson’s disease. They may recommend 5 mg twice a day, potentially taken via injections.
 Those who suffer from Alzheimer’s disease may suffer from diminished mental function. NADH supplements, however, may help reduce these symptoms. Talk to your doctor about taking NADH. They may recommend 10mg of NADH per day. Further research is necessary to confirm the benefits of taking NADH to treat Alzheimer’s., Vitamin B3 (which, again, allows your body to make NADH) is known to help increase the levels of dopamine in your brain. Technically, dopamine and serotonin are the chemicals in your brain that allow you to feel happiness and contentment. Specific studies have tied NADH to a reduction in symptoms associated with depression. Supplementing with B3 or NADH may help people with depression. Talk to your doctor further about using NADH to treat depression.

 Light therapy comes in a variety of forms, as researchers have yet to find a definitively successful method and dose. This form of therapy works by using light exposure to kill bacteria that causes acne.Depending on the type of light therapy being used, you may be able to complete this therapy method at home, or you may need to visit your doctor's office.
Possible side effects include pain, red skin, and increased sensitivity.
 In this therapy method, a chemical solution (like salicylic acid) is applied to the skin to treat the site of acne. Chemical peels may be highly effective for some people, but should not be used by anyone taking oral retinoids, as the combination may cause significant skin irritation.Possible side effects of chemical peels include severe redness of the skin, scaling/blistering, and long-term skin discoloration.
 If you haven't had any luck with topical or oral treatments, a dermatologist may be able to manually remove whiteheads and blackheads from your skin. This should only be done by a qualified dermatologist in a controlled setting and using a specialized tool, and may cause permanent scarring of the skin., Some acne conditions, like nodular and cystic lesions, may be treated with steroid injections. A dermatologist will inject a steroid treatment directly into the lesion, which may improve your skin without having to extract the comedone. However, this treatment option may cause thinner skin, a lighter/paler complexion, and visible blood vessels at the site of treatment.

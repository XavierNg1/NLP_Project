 Bleach is a strong chemical, but it’s definitely an effective method for stain removal. Keep in mind that this may lead to some discoloration, but that can be fixed. A basic laundry bleach can be used, but it may not be strong enough to remove a deep stain. A swimming pool bleach, like Shock Treatment, is stronger and more likely to work., At this point, it’s a good idea to put on a pair of rubber gloves for protection. Take a cup, bucket, or something you won’t be drinking out of, and fill it with hot water. Pour the bleach crystals in the water until you have a saturated mixture., Pour some of the bleach mixture directly on the ink stain. Apply the bleach with a soft cloth if you’re nervous about pouring too much bleach on the floor. Let it sit for about 10 minutes. It should work quickly. If not, try again. And if you still see the stain, let it sit overnight.You can also apply the bleach with a soft-bristle toothbrush. Just make sure you will never use that toothbrush again!

, After you’ve applied the bleach, pour a little bit of distilled white vinegar on top of the (formally) stained area. This will neutralize the area where you applied the bleach. Basically, it will keep bleach droplets from rising to the surface after you’ve finished cleaning., Use a wet rag to rinse off the area. Scrub for a few minutes to make sure that you’ve removed all of the bleach and vinegar. Then, let the wood dry overnight., This is one of the weaker wood bleaches, but you still might notice some discoloration. Again, don’t panic. Sand down the area and apply a light wood stain. Then, reapply the finish. Your floor should look like new again.

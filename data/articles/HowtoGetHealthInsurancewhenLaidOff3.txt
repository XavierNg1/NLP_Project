 If you live in a state which has expanded coverage under the ACA and you make less than 138% of the federal poverty level, you are eligible for Medicaid. If your state has not expanded coverage, it will be much more difficult to gain coverage under Medicaid. Determine your eligibility at http://www.hhs.gov/answers/medicare-and-medicaid/who-is-eligible-for-medicaid/index.html, If your spouse has coverage, getting added onto their coverage might be a great option. As a matter of fact, if you or your spouse loses coverage, there is a mandatory enrollment period allowing one partner to be added onto the other’s coverage., Although this is likely the most expensive option, it might be your only option if you don’t qualify for a subsidy. The easiest option for going about this might be to contact a broker, as the price from a broker will be the same as the price directly from the insurer.

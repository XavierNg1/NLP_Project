 A great way to showcase a larger collection of hand selected cards is by organizing them in a binder. Purchase a binder and pocket protection pages. You will be able to find the pocket protectors online or at your local hobby store.
 Organize your baseball cards by brand and year. Start with the oldest, most valuable cards, and move to the newer, less valuable cards.
 Decide what the collection is worth as a whole. You may find it helpful to look for similar collections online, to see what they're charging. Take a moment to jot down every card in the collection in the order you are presenting them in. This will help you understand the worth, and inform the buyers of what exactly they are purchasing., Always ask for a price a little higher than what they are really worth. This will open up a negotiation and barter between you and the buyer. Negotiate the best deal you can for your collection. Collect payment before sending your card collection out or having it collected if completing the transaction online.

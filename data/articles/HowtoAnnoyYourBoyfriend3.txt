 Talk about how 'ugly' or 'fat' you think you look, even if you don't feel this way. Ask him if you look fat. When he tells you, 'no', be sure to continue pestering him but don't make him too uncomfortable.Fish for compliments. Never ask directly for acknowledgement, rather user sarcasm or the tone of your voice to let him know that he should compliment you.
 Anytime he wants to go out without you, pretend to whine and pout. Playfully, ask him if he's going out to pick up chicks but reassure him once the joke is over.Make him choose between hanging with his guy friends or hanging out with you. You can make the choice obvious by saying something obviously playful like, "you can either play poker with your friends or you can stay home with me and clean the garage."

, Men absolutely hate it when their girlfriend asks who they were with and what they were doing. Suspicion is not an aphrodisiac so only pretend to be a crazy jealous girlfriend and don't go too far into the role.Stick to light suspicious questioning. If you start checking his phone and computer for evidence of what he's up to when you aren't around, you may have bigger issues in the relationship.
Lightly tease him if he hangs out with other females.
 Female mini-tests of getting proof that he loves you or will choose you over something/one or (god, forbid) will die for you.


Be insecure. Question things he does and pretend that he is doing it intentionally to slight you.

 Sometimes it can get overheated. If you've been playing for a while, touch the console. If it's really warm, then maybe it's time to give your Nintendo 64 a break.;
, Push it in hard to make sure it can give off some signal. If it still doesn't work, get some new a new AV cable.
 Try pushing it down a little harder to make sure it's really able to read it. Because if it's only half reading it, the N64 just gets stuck.

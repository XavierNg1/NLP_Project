 Exposure to lead has also been connected with the development of ADHD.Check your plumbing for lead pipes, especially in older buildings.


If possible, have these pipes replaced. If you canâ€™t have them replaced, then you can install a water filter on your faucet or use a pitcher filter to remove heavy metals.
You can also try running the tap for at least one minute to flush away any lead.
 If you think you may have lead paint, do NOT try to remove it yourself. Lead paint is a hazardous substance and it needs to be removed by a professional.If the paint is in good condition, then you can also paint over it or cover it with paneling, drywall, or a sealant. Consult a painting professional for advice.
Never let your child eat lead paint or put painted toys in his or her mouth.

Marlin
Orange Roughy
Shark
Swordfish
Tilefish
Tuna (Bigeye, Ahi)

, The FDA considers mercury amalgam fillings to be safe for children over the age of six, but some people choose to opt for porcelain or composite fillings instead. If your child has mercury amalgam fillings, then you may consider having them replaced to eliminate a potential ADHD risk factor.

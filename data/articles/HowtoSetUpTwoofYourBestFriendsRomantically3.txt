 Once your two friends actually go out on a date alone, you’ll probably be curious to know how things went. Your friends will likely anticipate you following up with a few questions. However, just because you introduced them doesn’t mean they have to share every detail of their date with you. Avoid pressuring your friends to tell you everything.


Do not interrupt your two friends while they’re out on a date alone. Avoid texting to find out how things are going until you are sure the date is over. Waiting until the next day to follow up is best.
When you do follow up, try asking something simple like, “How did things go?”

, After your friends have gone out once or twice, it might be tempting to continue helping the match along. It is best to avoid interfering, though. Once you’ve introduced them and they’ve made the decision to get to know each other better, your work is done. Unless one of them has specifically asked you to remain involved by mentioning something specific to their date or by organizing another outing, you should stay out of it. Your friends don’t need your help coordinating every step of their potential relationship. Plus, they might get annoyed by your constant interference, which could cause problems in your friendships with both parties., It can be exciting when you match two friends together who end up making a love connection. Things don’t always work out, though. It’s possible that the two people you attempt to set up romantically won’t have any chemistry. There’s nothing you can do about that and you shouldn’t take it personally.If your intentions were good and you genuinely thought your two friends would hit it off but don’t, just accept it and move on.

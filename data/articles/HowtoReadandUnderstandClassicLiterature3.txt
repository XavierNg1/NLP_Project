 After you finish the text or finish a chapter, commit to writing a brief summary of everything important that happened. Restrict yourself to about a half page or less, and make sure you address the major plot points, how those points affected each character, and how that chapter fits into the context of the larger book.Write your chapter summaries without consulting the text or your notes. This will help test your understanding of what you've read., Telling something about something you have learned is a good way to help you understand t better yourself. If you have a friend who also has an interest in classic literature, then you might consider telling him or her about the text.


Even if you have not yet finished reading a text, you may benefit from describing what has happened so far in your own words.
 For many readers, visualizing the characters, setting, and plot points of a book make it easier to absorb the narrative.While watching a movie is not a substitute for reading the actual book, it may help you arrive at a better understanding of the book.


For example, if you are reading a play by Shakespeare, then check out a filmed version of the play. While some versions use creative staging and may cut some of the dialogue, you will still be able to see most of the text come to life.

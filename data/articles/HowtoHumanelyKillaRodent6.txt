 Rodents, however small, are wild animals. They may bite if threatened. Additionally, they can transmit a variety of diseases. Wear tough gloves and long sleeves if you must touch them, but you should try to avoid this as much as is possible by using a sealable bag to contain the rodent.
 Live traps are popular among people who don't want to kill rodents as they offer a chance to release the animal into the wild. Also consider removing the cause for the infestation - the presence of rodents can be a symptom of a dirty, food-rich environment for the rodents to live in.


If you use a live trap, you should know that the survival rate for relocated rats is very low, so releasing them to a new location will often result in them dying.Removing the causes for an infestation is the only way to remain rat-free long-term., If the animal is wounded, releasing it into the wild can cause a more painful, drawn-out death than if it were quickly euthanized. It might be unpleasant, but it can be more humane to kill it, if you can do this.
 Agitating the rodent can cause it struggle, flee, or fight. Minimize unnecessary stimulation - handle the rodent gently, don't shine bright lights at it, and don't make loud noises.

 On almost all pages on Facebook, you can make a new post. There’s a post box located at the top of the News Feed, on your Timeline, and on your friends’ pages. Locate this post box and click in the text field to start making a post.
 ASCII codes are special codes you input into text fields that will create special symbols. There are several codes out there; for music notes, there are two:


Press ALT together with 13 on your numeric keypad to put one music note (♪).
Press ALT together with 14 on your numeric keypad to put two music notes (♫).
 For those who might want a different kind of music note, you can copy the music notes from web pages, like Music Notes for Facebook or Fsymbols.com. You can highlight the music note, and press Ctrl (Windows) or Cmd (Mac) + C to copy it.


Once you’ve copied the music note, go back to the status field, and paste it there (Ctrl/Cmd+V).
 Type in a message along with the music note, and click the “Post” button. Your post will appear with the music notes you’ve put together with your message.

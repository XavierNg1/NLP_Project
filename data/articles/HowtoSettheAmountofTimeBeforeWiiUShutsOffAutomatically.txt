 Press the Power button located at the lower-right of the device to turn it on.
 Tap on the Systems Settings icon at the bottom-right corner of the screen.
 Use the left analog stick of the gamepad to scroll your way in the System Settings menu. Scroll until you reach the Automatic Power Off option of the System Settings menu, and the press A to select it.
 Select “Off” from the options to turn off the feature.
 After enabling the feature after the brief disabling, you will be asked to select the duration of inactivity before the console turns off automatically.
 Simply select the duration of your liking before the Wii U turns off.


Your changes will automatically be saved; just exit the menu when you’re done.

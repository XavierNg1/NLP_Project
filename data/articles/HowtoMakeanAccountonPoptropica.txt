 Wait for it to load (the website can be somewhat slow at times, so wait for it).;
,, A box will pop up, along with the question, "Are you a boy or a girl?" The gender of your character does not have to be the same as your own gender.
 The box will shake as you select you age, and the question, "How old are you?" will also pop up. The age of your character does not have to be the same as your own age.
 The box will explode now, and a random character will come out. Your name will be an adjective and a noun, but you cannot type it in, so you will have to keep changing your character name until you find one that you desire. You can change your characteristics in when you click on "Change" in this step, or throughout the game, so don't worry if you like the name, but don't like their physical attraction.
 Go to an island and have fun!

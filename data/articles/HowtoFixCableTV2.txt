 You can check the cable signal is working by taking the plug from your cable box to your television directly. Be sure to remove any other connections that may cause interruptions or delays such as a VCR, DVD, game console, surge protector or other devices.
 One of your devices may be producing a picture that is not compatible with your display. Check to ensure your television is able to receive a specific signal from your pass through device.
 Check where the video input is plugged in on your television and confirm with your television’s “Input” settings. Check if the television is on channel 03 or channel 04 or if the input should be set to CATV, AV1, AV2, Video 1, HDMI or other similar video inputs.

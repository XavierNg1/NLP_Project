 Look for an oil and alcohol-free cleanser. Excess oil especially can break down the adhesive on your extensions. Opt for a foaming face cleanser or gentle face soap. You can even use baby shampoo.Be careful with baby shampoo because it can be drying.
You can dilute a foaming cleanser with a little water to make it more gentle.;
, Wet your lashes with warm water. Put some cleanser on your fingertips and work it gently into your eyelids and lashes. Use up-and-down movements. Don’t use side-to-side motions or tug your lashes so you don’t lose extensions or damage your natural eyelashes. Rinse thoroughly with warm water.Be sure to clean your lash line well because this is where bacteria and other dirt can build up most.
 Don’t use cotton pads or balls to clean your lashes. The fibers can get stuck in them and you’ll need to carefully pick those out. Also skip using cleansing wipes because those can loosen or rip out your extensions.

In other words, it's much better for your hair, but the contrast will be less stark. You can still style your hair and it may still hold a curl, unlike the results when you use harsh chemicals.
 Very thin or very damaged hair may not pass the test. You should ask the hairstylist whether you can try it or not. Hopefully, they'll be honest with you.

 If you don't already know how to sew, learning how is a must for dressmaking. Find a sewing class in your area, or ask someone who already knows how to teach you. If you want to be a dressmaker, you'll have to know how to do all sorts of specialty sewing, such as hemming dress sleeves, inserting zippers, sewing button holes, making neck lines, etc.;
, This takes a lot of practice to get right, so don't be afraid if your first few creations aren't exactly how you envisioned them. Learn how to sew different styles of clothing, and what colors and patterns compliment each other. With time, you'll learn how to turn what you see in your head into beautiful clothing.
 Buy fashion magazines, keep an eye out for what people are wearing, and watch to see which celebrity trends take off. Your eye will be drawn to what you like the most, but keep in mind that other people will like different things.
 This will help keep you organized. Also, when you start getting more business, being in the habit of writing things down will keep you on track.
 Wear your creations out in public. Make sewn gifts for your friends. If you have kids, dress them in things you made. These home-made garments will be sure to get noticed. Once people know that you sew, you can mention that you are starting a business. This will help you drum up customers. Enter your work in your local fair, and travel to craft shows. You could also start a blog with pictures of your work, make business cards, or advertise in your local paper. Anything to get the word out.
 Make a budget, design your pattern, and select your fabric. A good way to get fabric cheap is to shop at thrift stores and garage sales. You can buy old clothing and make new clothing, or design dresses out of second hand fabric.
 Take any job you can get at first, since you can always be more selective once your business is firmly established. Remember to budget your expenses carefully, so you don't lose more money than you gain.

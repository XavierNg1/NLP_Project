 Put the skillet over medium heat for at least five minutes before you start, so it gets entirely heated.;
, Removing excess surface moisture will help the meat to brown.
, Make sure there's some space between the pieces so they aren't crowded together.
 Once all the pieces are in the skillet, leave them alone. Don't stir them, don't jiggle the pan, and don't pick at them with tongs. Letting them cook for a few minutes undisturbed helps create a good crust.
 After a few minutes you will see the bottoms of the chunks begin to brown. Let them go another minute or so, then stir to flip the chunks over. Leave them alone again to brown.
 When the chunks are well-browned, remove them from the pan to a plate lined with a paper towel to drain off the oil.
 The ground turkey is now ready to be used in recipes for turkey chili, lasagna, pasta, and so on.

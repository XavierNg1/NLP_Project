 If your data fits best around a straight line, you'll want to use a linear trendline. This trendline represents a steady rate of increase or decrease.
 Data such as that for a startup business that experiences a flurry of initial sales that levels off over time can best be represented with this curved line.
 Data that cycles up and down, such as stock prices, can best be represented with a moving average trendline that smooths out the fluctuations to show the overall trend.


Moving average trendlines require setting a number of data points to be averaged; setting the period to two averages of each two successive points (first and second, second and third, third and fourth, etc.) to produce the points in the trendline.
 While a moving average trendline suppresses individual fluctuations, a polynomial trendline brings them out. This can be important for such things as analyzing fuel consumption at a given speed, where a peak (or bottom) value needs to be found.


Polynomial trendlines are classed according to the maximum number of peaks or valleys they contain. An Order 2 polynomial trendline has a single peak or bottom value, while an Order 3 trendline can have two such values, an Order 4 trendline can have up to three such values, and so on.
 This works with data sets such as those representing vehicle acceleration.


Power trendlines are valid only for data sets where all values are greater than zero.
 This trendline can be used with such things as radioactive decay, which progressively slows down over time.


Exponential trendlines are valid only for data sets where all values are greater than zero.

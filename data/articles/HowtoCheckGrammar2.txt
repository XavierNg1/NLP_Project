 Third-person singular verbs often end with "s" or "es," as "he says" or "she argues," while third-person plural verbs don't, as in "they argue." A series of singular nouns ("Smith and Jones"; "Moe, Larry, and Curly"; "Murdock et al.") is treated the same as a single plural noun and takes the plural verb form.


Corporate or collective nouns, which use a singular noun form to represent more than one person or item ("team," "group," "management"), take a singular verb in American English and a plural verb in British English.
 In addition to matching singular nouns with singular verbs and plural nouns with plural verbs, you need to match singular nouns with singular pronouns ("Batman pulled a rope from his utility belt") and plural nouns with plural pronouns ("The Dynamic Duo donned their gas masks").


Some style guides allow using "they" or "their" as singular pronouns or possessives when the gender being represented is unknown, while others prefer the inclusive "he or she" and "his or her."

, Tenses represent when an action occurred or will occur. There are three basic forms: present, past, and future. Use present tense ("he runs") for actions happening now, past tense ("he ran") for actions that happened in the past, and future tense ("he will run") for actions yet to happen.


Many novels and movies describe actions using the present tense. Case studies often describe actions in present tense as well, although the study methods and results are usually presented using the past tense.
 Most nouns take an "s" or "es" suffix to indicate the plural, never with an apostrophe. The exception to this is for plurals of single-letter words: it's acceptable to write "A's" to represent multiple renderings of the letter "A."

, Homophones are words that sound alike, but are spelled differently and have different meanings. The ability to distinguish between homophones is important because spell checkers are designed only to find misspellings, not incorrect uses of correctly spelled words. Some commonly confused homophones are given below:


�It's," the contraction for "it is;" and the possessive "its," meaning "belonging to it."
�To," a preposition; "too," a comparative or synonym for "also;" and "two," a number.
�Their," a possessive pronoun; "there," an adverb denoting location; and "they're," the contraction for "they are."
�Peak," meaning "summit;" "peek," meaning "look;" and "pique," meaning "stimulate."
�Compliment," meaning "to praise;" and "complement," meaning "to go together."
�Bare," meaning "to uncover;" and "bear," the animal.
�Led," meaning "directed;" and "lead," the metal. (It doesn't help that "led" is the past tense of "lead," which is spelled the same as the metal lead but pronounced differently.)
�Red," the color; and "read," the past tense of "read." (This homophone confusion exacerbates the confusion between "led" and "lead.")
�Pour," meaning "to dump or spill;" and "pore," meaning a microscopic skin opening or "to examine." (You pore over a gravy recipe, but you pour gravy over mashed potatoes.)

, The subjunctive form is used when writing about hypothetical situations, usually in clauses beginning with "if": "If I were in your shoes" and "If she were taller" are correct in these cases, while "I was in your shoes" and "She was taller" are correct when not writing hypothetically., When writing a formal essay or business communication to another business, use separate words ("do not," "will not") instead of contractions ("don't," "won't"). Contractions are acceptable in business communications to consumers when a less formal tone is called for.


Also, write out "and" instead of representing it with an ampersand ("&").
 The rule against ending sentences with prepositions (for, in, to, with) is relatively recent, but many regard it as a hard-and-fast rule. If possible, recast the sentence to avoid ending it with a preposition, unless the revision would sound more awkward than ending with a preposition.
 Infinitives are verb forms preceded by "to:" to be, to live, to read, to write. Splitting an infinitive is placing an adverb between the "to" and the verb, as in "to boldly go where no man has gone before." This rule was created at a time when there was a desire to make English more like Latin, whose infinitives cannot be split. In writing for an academic audience, infinitives should not be split, but in less formal writing, they may be.

 You should first understand their opinions on this rule. You might be too young, or they don't think you are ready for this yet. Parents want to keep their kids safe always, and they most likely do not want you to get hurt.;
, If their answer is "You aren't mature enough", then this is one of your best opportunities. You can do things without being asked to, help them out with things, and take things under your own wing. If they complain that your grade in math class is too low, maybe you could go to the teacher and see what you can do to get your grade up.
 You could say things like "I will still follow your rules", and give your own reasons why you should be able to ride the bus by yourself.
 If they are concerned about something happening to you on the way home, your friends can help with that. Power in numbers is a big deal. Maybe walk with two or three other friends so they know that you get there safely. People are less likely to hurt someone if they are with other people. Never go anywhere alone!

, This is one of the easiest ways for them to know where you are.
 If you follow the schedule, they should start letting loose on protecting you. This should create more trust between you and your parents or guardian.

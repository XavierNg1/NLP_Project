 Introducing division to a math problem doesn't change the rules regarding negative signs. If there are an odd number of negative signs, the answer is negative, while if there are an even number of negative signs (or none at all) the answer will be positive.


Let's use an example problem with both multiplication and division. In the problem -15 × 4 ÷ 2 × -9 ÷ -10, there are three negative signs, so the answer will be negative. As before, we can put a negative sign in the space for our answer, like this: -15 × 4 ÷ 2 × -9 ÷ -10 = -__


, Division can be thought of as multiplication done backwards. When you divide one number by another, you're asking in a roundabout way, "how many times does the second number fit into the first?" or, in other words, "what do I need to multiply the second number by to get the first?" See the basic 10 x 10 times table for reference - if you're asked to divide one of the answers in the times table by any number n from 1 - 10, you'll know that the answer is just the other number from 1 - 10 needed to multiply n to get it.


Let's look at our example problem. In -15 × 4 ÷ 2 × -9 ÷ -10, we see 4 ÷ 2. 4 is an answer in the times table - both 4 × 1 and 2 × 2 give 4 as an answer. Since we're being asked to divide 4 by 2, we know that we're basically solving the problem 2 × __ = 4. In the blank space, of course, we would write 2, so 4 ÷ 2 = 2. Let's rewrite our problem as -15 × (2) × -9 ÷ -10.
 As with multiplication, when you come across a division problem that's too difficult to work out mentally or with a times table, you have the option of solving with a long-form approach. In a long division problem, you write your two numbers in a special sideways L-shaped bracket, then divide digit-by-digit, shifting your partial answers to the right as you go to account for the decreasing value of the digits you're dividing - hundreds, then tens, then ones, and so on.


Let's use long division in our example problem. We can simplify -15 × (2) × -9 ÷ -10 to 270 ÷ -10. We'll ignore the signs as usual because we know the sign of our final answer. Write 10 to the left of the L-shaped bracket and write 270 underneath it.

We begin by dividing the first digit of the number under the bracket by the number to the side. The first digit is 2 and our number to the side is 10. Since 10 doesn't fit in two, we'll instead use the first two digits. 10 does fit in 27 - it fits in twice. Write "2" above the 7 under the bracket. 2 is the first digit in your answer.
Next, multiply the number to the left of the bracket by the digit you just discovered. 2 × 10 is 20. Write this under the first two digits of the number under the bracket - in this case, 2 and 7.
Subtract the numbers you just wrote. 27 minus 20 is 7. Write this at the bottom of your growing problem.
Drop down the next digit of the number under the bracket. This next digit of 270 is 0. Drop this down next to the 7 to make 70.
Divide your new number. Next, divide 10 into 70. 10 fits exactly 7 times into 70, so write at the top next to the 2. This is the second digit of your answer. Your final answer is 27.
Note that, in the event that 10 didn't divide evenly into our final number, we'd need to account for the amount of 10 that is left over - the remainder. For instance, if our final act was to divide 71, rather than 70, by 10, we would notice that 10 doesn't fit exactly in 71. It fits in 7 times, but there is 1 left over. In other words, we can fit seven 10s and an extra 1 in 71. We would write our answer, then, as "27 remainder 1" or "27 r1".

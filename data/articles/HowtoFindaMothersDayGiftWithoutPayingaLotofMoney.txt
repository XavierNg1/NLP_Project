 Maybe you'd like to include a collage or a bouquet of origami roses, use anything you want to make it a pretty card. Your mother will love the fact that you put some effort on it.
 You can cook early in the morning so you surprise your mother with a nice breakfast in bed. Make some coffee, eggs, orange juice, anything she likes to eat. She will love the fact that she does not have to cook that day, plus it is always pretty nice to wake up with a surprise like that.
 Moms love that kind of stuff. Maybe try to create perfume or go to a nearby garden to pick some lovely flowers for your mom.
 Find a nice way to create your own packet to put the gift in. You can design it on photo-shop or illustrator.
 Help your mom out with the work she does.
 Give her a manicure or pedicure, a facial, back rub, massage, etc.
 You will want to make your mom happy. Don't act naughty or bad on her day.
 Try to do things without being told. Serve your mom breakfast, cook dinner, set the table, clean the house, etc.

 This isn't necessary for a quick tuning, but for the best results you should always start from scratch. Loosen all of the tension rods so that they are still installed but are placing no pressure on the drum head., If this is a replacement job, and not a simple tuning, place the new head on and tighten the bolts a quarter turn each. Using your palm, press deeply into the new head to stretch it out. A head stretches once it's tightened in place, meaning it will go slack (and need more re-tuning) if not pre-stretched., Tighten the batter head with the same system of opposing pairs used on the front head. Remember that if you tune the 12:00 first, you've got to jump to the 6:00 right after. You can then move to the 3:00 and the 9:00, and so on.
 You're still working in opposing pairs of tension rods. Remember, it is just a 180 turn on each rod to start -- you'll adjust later. If you had a string connecting each tension rod to the rod straight across from it, they would be pulling on each other with even strength.
 Hit the head with a stick at the same point in front of each tension rod. Unless you lucked out on a perfect tuning, each rod will likely sound a little bit different. Use your drum key to get them perfectly aligned.


Test all the rods first and see what sound you like best, or which sound is most common. Tune the rest to this.
Tightening the rod makes it higher pitched while loosening it will make it sound deeper.

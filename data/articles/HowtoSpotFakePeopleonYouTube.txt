 A simple hello or nice channel always works. It gets your respect. Remember, only do this with the intention that they're fake. It's the Internet after all, they're in this for the chase, and to play the game, you must think ahead.;
, The reality is, the girls that use YouTube are in contact with guys anyway. If there is constant communication with the opposite sex, the onus is really on you. That type of girl will be down for that type of thing. There is an age factor, although it takes one to know one.
 Never involve your heart with your head. It is a game. To win, you must never show your true character, make it obvious your a fake person too. Chances are, they will spot it, and it will be harder for them. Girls want us to chase them, make it clear it should be the other way around.
 Play the game, if you must, make it clear on her wall that they are fake. From there, cut off all contacts. In some instances they can possibly disable you from viewing their page.
 People come and go. Keep it real and enjoy it.

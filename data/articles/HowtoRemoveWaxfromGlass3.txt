 Ideal for the job is a sharp razor blade or window scraper to gently remove wax from a flat surface, such as a glass table top. These are more ideal than a pocket-knife or other rounded blade that might scratch the glass. You want to be very gentle if you try to scrape the wax off a surface that you're unable to heat or wipe.
 Soak a sponge in some very hot water and try to moisten the wax and loosen it slightly before you go at it with the scraper. You might even be able to wipe it off completely, making scrapes unnecessary.
 Focus on using soft, gentle strokes to prevent the razor blade from slipping, and to also prevent the blade or scraper from leaving scratches on the glass surface. Continue to scrape until all wax residue has been removed from the glass surface.
 Use a damp, warm cloth to remove any small amounts of wax residue that have been left behind, cleaning it thoroughly. It's easy to leave behind a waxy or cloudy residue, making the wipe-down particularly important.









Alternately, you can spray glass cleaning solution on the wax and clean off using a paper towel or soft rag. It might take several passes before you get it up completely. Be diligent!

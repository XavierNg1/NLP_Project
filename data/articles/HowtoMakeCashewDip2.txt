 Add ½ cup (75 g) of raw cashews, 2 chiles in adobo, 2 garlic cloves, and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of water to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse the mixture until it is smooth, which should take 10 to 15 seconds.If the dip seems too thick after you process it, you may want to mix in a little more water. Add it a tablespoon (15 ml) at a time, though, so you don’t thin it out too much.
If you want a milder dip, you can reduce the chiles to 1. If you prefer a spicier dip, you can add additional chiles.
 After you’ve finished processing the dip, give it a taste. Add as much salt and freshly ground black pepper as you’d like to season it to your preferences.If you like, you can further season the dip with fresh herbs, such as finely chopped cilantro or parsley.
 Once the dip is properly seasoned, transfer it to a serving bowl. Sprinkle a pinch or two of chopped cashews over the top to garnish it, and serve.Vegetables, crackers, sliced pita, and tortilla chips are all delicious with the dip.

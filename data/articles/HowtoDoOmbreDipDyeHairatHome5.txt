 Do not make it too hot or cold or it will damage your hair. Aim for a warm temperature that feels comfortable to you.
 You don't need to shampoo your hair, just deep condition and use the conditioner and shampoo included in the kit. Continue to use conditioner that came in the kit anytime you shampoo in the next few days. Try to put off shampooing your hair as long as you can after the initial rinse.
 Let your hair air dry to avoid damaging it further.

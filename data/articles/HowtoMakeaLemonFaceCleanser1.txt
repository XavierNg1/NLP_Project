The lactic acid in it is also naturally exfoliating, so it will help make your skin brighter and softer.To get the most benefits from this cleanser, use full-fat yogurt instead of low-fat or non-fat.
 You cannot go wrong with adding honey. It is both antibacterial and moisturizing, making it ideal for those with acne or dry skin. If you not have any honey on hand, however, you can leave it out of the cleanser., Keep stirring until the color and texture are consistent. You don't want any streaks or "puddles" of lemon juice.
 Splash your face with warm water first, then gently massage the cleanser in, making sure to avoid the area around your eyes. Wait 1 to 2 minutes, then rinse the cleanser off with warm water. Follow up with a slash of cool water, then pat your face dry.








To make this cleanser even more effective, place a warm, damp towel over your face for 1 to 2 minutes first, then apply the cleanser.
Apply your usual moisturizer afterwards. This will keep the lemon from being too drying.

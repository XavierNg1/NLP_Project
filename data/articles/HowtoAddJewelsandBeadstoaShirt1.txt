 Youâ€™ll want a color and design that will compliment the beading and jewels you plan to add (or you may want to match the jewels and beads to the shirt).


Consider choosing a shirt that is 100% cotton as this fabric will hold the beading better than a more delicate material.
Pre-wash your shirt so that you have the proper fit and size prior to sewing (to avoid having the shirt shrink after the beads have been sewn onto the garment).;
, Visiting a bead store will be your best bet to have the widest selection. Consider bringing your shirt with you so you can see what the beads/jewels will look like before you make a purchase.


Make sure each jewel/bead has a hole that will allow you to sew it into place.
Ask the bead store clerk how the beads/jewels you select will hold up being washed.
 Go for stronger thread since you will be attaching a bulky item to your shirt.


Make sure the thread color matches the beading/shirt color so the thread will be unnoticeable.

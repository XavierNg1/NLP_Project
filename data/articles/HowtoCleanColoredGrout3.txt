 A sealer will make your colored grout stain-resistant, since it makes the grout more resistant to oil- and water-based products.If your grout is very soiled, you could also re-apply the color sealant originally used to color the grout.Depending on the amount of wear and tear and the type of sealant you choose, you will need to re-apply it every year or two.
If you are not sure whether your grout is sufficiently sealed, drip some water on it. If the water stays on the surface of the grout, it is sufficiently sealed. However, if the grout absorbs the water, you need to reseal the grout.When you purchase the sealer, ask if it is both hydrophobic and oleophobic. Some sealers are only water repelling or hydrophobic, whereas others will repel both water and oil-based substances.
 When coffee or soda spills on your colored grout, you should wipe it up right away. This will reduce the amount of work involved in cleaning the grout., When you finish your shower, use a squeegee to quickly wipe down your shower tiles. This will prevent the accumulation of lime, soap deposits and rust stains on your colored grout.

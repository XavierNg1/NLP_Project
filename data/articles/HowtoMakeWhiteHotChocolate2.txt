 Pour the milk into a microwave-safe mug, and heat it for 1 to 2 minutes. Pause the microwave every 30 seconds, and give the milk a stir.
 Put the chocolate into a microwave-safe bowl. Take the mug out of the microwave, and put the bowl in. Heat the chocolate for 1 minute, then give it a stir. After that, heat it at 15 to 20-second increments, stirring in between, until it melts.You can use solid chocolate or chocolate chips for this. If you choose to use solid chocolate, be sure to cut it into chunks first.
For best results, use high-quality white chocolate.
 Keep stirring until everything is mixed together. If the milk has cooled down too much for you, you can pop it into the microwave for another 30 seconds.
 You can serve it as is, or you can add some mini marshmallows or whipped cream for an extra-special treat.

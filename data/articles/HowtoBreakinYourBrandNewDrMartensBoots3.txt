 You want the boots to feel tight, so use woolen or winter socks., You may need to force your feet to fit into the boots, and this won't be the most comfortable experience. Without a tight fit, however, the leather won’t have any reason to stretch or expand.


If the boots still feel loose, try putting on two or three pairs of socks at once.
 Keeping the hair dryer about six inches away from the shoe, blow hot air on the tight areas of the boots for about 30 seconds, flexing your feet and wiggling your toes as you go.Each problem spot should receive its own 30-second heat treatment.
 Keep wearing your new shoes until they’ve cooled down, walking around and flexing your foot as you wait. The boots should be about room temperature to the touch before you remove them, otherwise you’ll negate the heating process.
 You may need to repeat this method several times, paying close attention to which spots need the most attention. Focus the heat treatment on those areas.


Try wearing a thicker pair of socks if you find it necessary to repeat the steps. It’s possible your fit wasn’t tight enough to force the leather to stretch.
 Heat removes moisture from the leather, which may cause cracks or breaks in the shoes. Avoid this side effect by applying products designed to restore moisture and keep the leather supple, such as Dr. Martens Wonder Balsam.

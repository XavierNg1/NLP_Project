 If you drop your finger over to the side before you release the ball, expect to get more cut than sink on your ball.;
, This will give the pitch a little clockwise rotational spin, causing it to move into a right-handed batter if thrown as a right-handed pitch.
 lowering your arm-angle will make the pronation you apply to the ball more natural, in addition to putting less pressure on your arm.
 You can adjust the sinker in the following ways to get a different movement to it:


The lower you throw it in the strike zone the more it will drop.
The faster your (arm) speed, the more break you tend to get.
If you flick your wrist, it could help with the drop. This, however, will put more strain on your wrist. See if it feels comfortable.

 Place these ingredients in a large, heavy stock pot.;
, Pour enough beef broth and red wine into the stockpot to cover the ingredients.


Start with the beef broth and make up the difference with the red wine.
If you still do not have enough liquid to cover the ingredients, add a little water or additional broth.
 After it begins to boil, stir it, cover the pot, and reduce the heat to medium. Let it simmer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.


Stir the oxtails every 15 to 30 minutes to ensure even cooking.
If the liquid is still boiling rapidly after dropping the heat, you may need to drop the heat to medium-low. The oxtails should cook in simmering liquid, not rapidly boiling liquid.
Remove the pot from the heat after the designated amount of time has passed.
 Heat the oil first for 30 to 60 seconds before adding the flour. Stir continuously for 3 minutes.


Vegetable oil, bacon drippings, or shortening can also be used instead of olive oil.
 Add this liquid to the skillet and stir continuously until a thick gravy forms.


You can also add a few dashes of browning sauce to the gravy to deepen the color.
The gravy can be flavored with additional salt, pepper, and garlic powder, if desired.
Remove the skillet from the heat.
 Transfer the oxtails from the stock pot to the skillet, coating them with the gravy by stirring them in. Heat over medium-low for 5 minutes.
 Allow the oxtails to rest for 3 to 5 minutes before serving.

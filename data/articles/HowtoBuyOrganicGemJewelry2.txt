 The gemstone is not quite as valuable as pearl and does not appear in chain store jewelers frequently, but small jewelers and online merchants are more likely to sell it. Buying amber in person is preferable to buying online, though, since fake amber is commonly sold as the real deal and is easier to check if purchased in person.


If you do buy amber online, only buy from trusted, certified merchants who have a decent return policy.
 Amber is made from fossilized pine tree resin and usually has a rich golden honey or light brown hue, but one shade is not necessarily better than another. Blue amber even exists, but since it is quite rare, it tends to be expensive.
 Amber is not a gemstone that is meant to look smooth. In fact, some of the most valuable and expensive pieces contain inclusions of insects, plants, or pyrites. The inclusions and veins found in amber give it more character and do not ruin the quality or durability of the stone.
 Amber floats in salt water, but plastics meant to mimic amber usually sink. If you buy the amber as loose gemstones instead of in a solid piece of jewelry, the float test is a good way to test for fakes.
 Heat a needle and gently touch the needle to the bottom of the stone. Real amber will give off the scent of pine when heated. Fake amber will usually smell acidic or otherwise unpleasant.
 Wipe a cotton swab dabbed in acetone over the amber gemstone. Real amber will feel the same way before and after, but a fake will feel soft and sticky afterward.

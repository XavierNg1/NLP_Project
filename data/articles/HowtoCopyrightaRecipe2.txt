 If you can answer yes to all these questions you have a patentable invention, provided all other elements fall into place.Is the invention patentable subject matter? Is it a process, machine, manufacture, or composition of material?
Is the invention useful? Does it actually apply to something functional?
Is the invention novel? Is it new?
Is the invention non-obvious? Is it a copy of an existing invention, even though it's new?

, It states, "Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title." You should hire an attorney and do a patent search. Then you apply for the patent, and wait to be approved or rejected, which is an expensive and long drawn out process.

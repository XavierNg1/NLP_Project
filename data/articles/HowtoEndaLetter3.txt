 If you've said all that you need to say, there's no need to add a postscript, or a "PS." In fact, there are certain occasions when you actually shouldn't - namely, when you're writing any type of business letter.
 Postscripts are often added after a letter has been signed as a way to include information that was accidentally left out, or that is not important enough to warrant its own paragraph in the letter. For example,


"PS. I bought you a souvenir! I'll give it to you when I get back."
"PS. My aunt says 'hi.'"

, Sometimes postscripts are included as a way to lighten a letter's tone with a joke, or to playfully flirt with the recipient. Since postscripts are usually just a sentence or two, they can be used as a way of including information without the pressure of writing an explanation. Take these, for example:


"PS. I already finished off the box of chocolates. Please send more supplies."
"PS. Oh, I forgot to mention one thing: I'm madly in love with you."

, It should flow seamlessly from body to conclusion, with no inconsistencies in tone or message. If it doesn't, erase what you wrote or press "Delete" and keep working on it. People often read letters more than once, and some even save them forever. It's worth taking a few extra minutes to make the letter perfect.

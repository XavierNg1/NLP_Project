 If your suede gloves are work or gardening gloves, they probably have old water stains on them. To get rid of those stains, start by rewetting your gloves completely. The best way to do this is to run your gloves under a faucet. This ensures an even application of water, which can prevent water stains after this process is over., Use paper towel to blot up the water by pressing down on your gloves. Don’t push down too hard, as this can actually force stains further into the suede. Use only slightly more pressure than you would get from resting your hand on top of your gloves., Once you’ve blotted up the water, let your gloves air dry completely. Don’t put them in the dryer, as this will cause your gloves to shrink. You might need to use a suede brush or paper towel to fluff up the suede once they are dry.

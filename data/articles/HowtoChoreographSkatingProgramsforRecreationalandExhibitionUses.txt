 Unlike dancing in a club, spontaneity is not a good idea, unless if you only want to work on your turns and do no spins and jumps. Even when you are skating recreationally and the DJ plays the songs, it is better to have a few of your favourite songs and songs you know well already in your memory and talk to the DJ and request them, or have your own mix tape ready.;
, Just like singing, where there are songs you simply can't sing to, don't try to force to plan an overly ambitious program if you can't perform a triple Axel or land a jump combo, or skate to a song that simply doesn't suit you.
 For example, if you are a jump expert, fit a couple of jumps here and there, but if you are better at step sequences, change the speed of skating.
, Remember: Figure skating is as much about artistry and expressive interpretation as well as technical prowess. Your face is also a part of interpreting your music as well as the costume you've chosen and body movements on the ice.

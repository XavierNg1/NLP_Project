 If you can't find a matching color, choose a neutral color that is a similar shade. For example, if you have a dark blue shirt, and you can't find any dark blue bias tape, get black bias tape. If you have a light blue shirt, and can't find any matching bias tape, get some light grey bias tape instead.


This method works great on shirts that you are sewing from scratch!

, How much longer you cut it depends on the width of your bias tape. This will typically be about Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters).
 Make sure that you are pinning the right side of the bias tape to the right side of the shirt. You will eventually be folding the bias tape inside the shirt.Leave about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of extra bias tape to either side of the shirt., Use the crease along the bottom fold of the bias tape as a guide.
 Fold the bias tape down first, then fold it inside your shirt. The raw edges should now be under the bias tape. The bias tape also should not be visible from the outside. The seam between the bias tape and the shirt will be right along the bottom edge of the shirt., Use a heat setting that is suitable for the material you are working with. Each fabric will require a different heat setting.
 If you'd like, you can clip the corner of the bias tape first to reduce bulk., Sew with the inside of the shirt facing you, so that you can get as close to the top edge of the bias tape as possible. Use a bobbin thread that matches your shirt color, and a sewing thread that matches your bias tape color.Remember to sew back and forth a few times at the start and end of the shirt.
Pull out the pins as you go.
 Your shirt is now ready to wear!

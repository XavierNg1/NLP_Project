 A fledgling pigeon can be housed in a small cardboard box or bird cage. A young fledgling may be kept in a high-sided cardboard box. The box does not have to be large because this is only a temporary solution. You should take a found fledgling to a wildlife sanctuary or release the bird into the wild as soon as possible.If you are housing the pigeon in a closed cardboard box, make sure there are lots of air holes.
 Fledglings pigeons need to be kept warm, especially if they are injured. Place an electric heating pad or hot water bottle in the cage. You should cover the heating pad with towels so that the bird has an indirect heat source.Alternatively, you can place a heating lamp over top of the bird's cage to help keep the bird warm.
 Try and mimic a nest, by lining a small bowl with a dry towel. Place this “nest” in the bird’s enclosure. This will allow the bird to feel cosy and secure.Change the towel daily in order to keep the nest clean.
Do not place the bird on a slippery surface, such as plastic. This could cause their legs to splay, which can impact their development and mobility.
 It is also important that you provide the bird with water. Fill a small deep and heavy bowl with water. The fledgling should be able to drink water on its own.Do not squirt water into the bird’s mouth.
 Place the bird’s habitat in a quiet space away from other pets. You also want to choose an area that doesn’t get a lot of human traffic. This will help to calm the fledgling.

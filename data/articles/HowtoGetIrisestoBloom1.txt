 The first and most likely cause for irises failing to bloom is overcrowding. Irises must be dug up, divided and replanted every three to four years.If this does not happen, it becomes less likely that your irises will bloom.;
, Use a shovel to begin working the soil roughly six to eight inches away from the stems of the irises. Loosen the clump of iris roots away from the dirt.


When it is loosened up, lift the clump out of the ground with the tip of the shovel.
 Pull multiple rhizomes apart by hand. Make sure there is a healthy fan of leaves attached to each rhizome.
 Re-plant the remaining, healthy rhizomes right away. Choose a spot that is bright and sunny. The soil should drain quickly or else your irises will get soggy feet, which can also halt their ability to bloom.

 Maybe you like the idea of holding the wedding at your home. If someone close to you has a scenic home, a lovely garden, or is on the beach, consider asking if you can hold your wedding at their house. Of course, this can be asking a lot.


Be considerate of their home and yard, and any parking limitations, and how the number of guests you’re inviting will fit into the space.
Also, be aware of bathroom usage. Be aware of any water usage, septic, or just plain not enough bathrooms in the house.
Keep in mind things like parking, bathrooms and handicap accessibility. Make sure people are able to get to your wedding. Renting a portable toilet is an option if there are not enough bathrooms for the number of guests.
 If you rent one space instead of two, you will usually save money. Many venues, especially if they hold weddings frequently, are fully equipped to handle the ceremony and reception, and are able to make the switch easily between the two. , If you live in a city, venues may generally be more expensive. Move the celebration to a smaller town adjacent to your city and you might find that your costs decrease., By selecting a location that looks beautiful or interesting, such as an art museum, aquarium or manicured garden, you may not need much in the way of decorations. There may already be beautiful decorations or floral arrangements in the venue, which means you may not need to do as much for decorating.

 Fit the shirt into the ironing board like you were putting it on a person. The fabric should lie flat but not be too stretched.
 Smooth out major wrinkles with your hand and make sure everything is as flat as possible.
 The main trick with ironing a tee-shirt, as will any knit fabric, is that you should not move the iron in the normal circular or arced motion. Instead, press the iron to one spot at a time and do not move it around when it is touching the fabric (as much as is possible).


Knit fabrics stretch easily if you push and pull the fabric by moving the iron while it is hot.
, Lay the shirt as flat as possible until it cools, making sure that all wrinkles are smoothed out.
 Fold the shirt or hang it to prevent wrinkles from forming before you wear it.

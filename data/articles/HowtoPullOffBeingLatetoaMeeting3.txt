 If you find yourself suddenly stuck in traffic, the best business etiquette is to call the person or their administrative assistant, apologize and ask:


If it is okay for you to still come in and keep the appointment, even though you're going to be 15 or more minutes late. It is vital to estimate a reasonable time for your late arrival, as this allows the receptionist to check the diary to see whether or not your being late will cause other things to be out of schedule.
If you're going to be late by half an hour or more, ask for a rescheduling of the appointment or if it's still okay to come.
Take your cue from their answers. Either turn up as fast as you can, or turn up on time for the rescheduled appointment.
 Give a short, factual reason for your late arrival and let them know that you are now keen to get down to business.

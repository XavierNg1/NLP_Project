 Forcing a restart interrupts your iPhone's functions, shuts it down, and reboots it.


iPhone 6S and earlier: Press and hold the sleep/Wake button + Home button.

iPhone 7 and 7 Plus: Press and hold the sleep/Wake button + volume-down button.
 When you see the Apple logo, release both buttons.

Because a force restart can cause data loss, it should only be used when your iPhone can't be powered off normally.

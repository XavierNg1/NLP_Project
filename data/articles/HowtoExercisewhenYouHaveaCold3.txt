 When you are sick, your body is not at its peak. Your muscles are weaker and you fatigue faster. Because of this, you are likely not going to be able to perform to the same standards as you typically do with weights.


This means that you are at greater risk of injury while you are sick, especially if you try to do the intensity and weight you are used to doing while healthy., Vigorous team sports are not a good idea when you are sick. Although some physical exercise may make you feel better, a large game of football or soccer could cause you to worsen your symptoms. Your friends may also crash into you while you are weak with a cold, which can do more harm to your body when you aren’t feeling well.


Plus, you are likely to spread your germs to the other players if you are all handling the same equipment, which isn’t safe for them., If you are sick with a cold, avoid going to the gym. Not only are you more likely to do a more vigorous workout that can weaken your body more, you are also at risk of spreading your germs to those around you.


Consider if you would want a person with your symptoms using the machines at the gym before you.
Instead of going to the gym, do a simple, gentle exercise routine at home., If you are training for a marathon or triathlon, take extra care when you get a cold. Instead of heading out for your long-distance run like usual, run for a shorter length of time or skip a day all together. Long-distance running takes hours and puts continual stress on your body over this time period, which is not good for your immune system.


Studies have shown that intense bouts of strenuous exercise actually compromise your immune system for up to a day afterward. This means your body would be more susceptible to increased or additional sickness in the time after your run.

 Going to the arcade, etc. will make it happy. If you want to go to the arcade or something, switch to another pet.;
, Don't even feed it gack - even though it seems gross, it will still make your pet less hungry and more healthy. When you're not playing at the arcade or doing anything that makes it happy, switch back to that pet so it gets hungrier (it will get hungrier if you do things with it without feeding it).
 Log in and out with the pet you want to make sick, but never put it to bed.
 Leave the Webkinz screen up and logged in, and eventually, Webkinz will log you out. Once this happens, log back in and do it again. Even while you're not playing, your pet will continue to get hungrier.
 Once it has an icepack on its head, do not take it to the doctor yet. Wait until it also has a thermometer in its mouth. Then you can take it to Dr. Quack.

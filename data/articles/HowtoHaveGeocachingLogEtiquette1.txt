 After writing a meaningful sentence or two, you could end your log with one of the common acronyms but don't make it the only thing in your log.:


TFTC = Thanks For The Cache
TFTH = Thanks For The Hike
TNLN = Took Nothing, Left Nothing
SL = Signed Log.;
,


Always note in both the trackable and cache log if anything is missing. This way, the trackable owner will be notified where it went missing and who the last person to hold it was - as well as notifying anyone who searches for the cache.
Write down any trackables that you take or leave, despite it appearing/disappearing in the trackable list. A lot of trackables have travel missions, so it's always interesting to read if something goes to another country or overseas.
 Whether the log is damp/wet, almost filled with signatures, or missing, notify the owner immediately. In such an emergency, you can use a notification icon pertaining to the situation. If you can, take a photo of the cache condition to post with your 'needs maintenance' log. Don't wait for a cache logbook (log sheet) to become completely full before reporting it. Note the almost full log in your online log.
 Every cache is placed in a different environment. Any muggle obstacles? Wildlife? Hiking experiences? How easy or hard was it to complete the puzzle? Did you take anyone with you?

, The entire concept of geocaching is like "finding the treasure at the end of a rainbow." Don't spoil it for other people by describing the immediate area (or "ground zero"). If you have the need to, always cipher (encode) that section of your log.
 Autumn foliage, snow cover, animals nearby, historical statues, and other interesting sights can enhance your online log for others to enjoy.

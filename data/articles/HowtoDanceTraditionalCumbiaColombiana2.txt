 Over time, the step sequence changed and became more formalized. Instead of short, sliding steps, they became a simple 4-count, “two-step” forward and backward motion. It’s not necessary to use this pattern if dancing in the original style. However, it’s important to know it as most people dance the cumbia this way today.


This appears to be largely due to the addition of other musical instruments to the cumbia, such as the guitar, accordion, tambora (a large, two-sided drum), maraca, conga (a Cuban hand drum), horns and the piano., Stand with your feet close together, which is the neutral position. You can hold your skirt with one or both hands and wave it. Or you can bend both arms at the elbows and roll them inward in circles close to your body – in the space between your shoulders and hips.


Women can tilt their wrists up for a feminine flair., As you step back, pivot your left foot so that your right curls slightly behind your left and a little to the side. It should be about a 1–2 feet (0.30–0.61 m) behind your left.
 As you’re doing the dance, be enthusiastic and smile flirtatiously.
 Lift your heel and step forward on your toes to the neutral position.


Pause for a beat to switch your weight from left to right.
 Do this as you did with your right foot, but now pivoting your right instead.
 Pause when your left foot comes to the neutral position. Then repeat the basic moves, starting with your left foot.


Move your hips and torso from side to side to the rhythm as you do the steps.
Mouth or count to yourself for each beat: 1 when your right foot goes back, 2 when your left steps in place, 3 when your right moves forward, and 4 when it comes to neutral.
When you repeat and move your left foot back first, start counting from 5-8.

 Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper and allow it to sit in the buttermilk for at least 2 hours.The salt and pepper should be to taste, but if you aren't sure how much to use, start with 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt and 1/8 tsp (0.625 ml) black pepper.
Make sure that the chicken is in a nonreactive bowl. Some metal bowls have an adverse reaction with the slightly acidic buttermilk, so it is best to use glass, ceramic or plastic.
Cover the bowl and allow the chicken to marinate in the refrigerator. It should sit for at least 2 hours, but it can be marinated overnight.
 When you are ready to cook the chicken thighs, heat the oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius).


Use an instant-read candy thermometer to monitor high oil temperatures.
A deep-fryer works best, but in a pinch, you could also use thick metal stockpot with tall sides. Heat the oil in the stockpot over medium-high heat.
 Place the flour, beaten eggs, and cornmeal into bowls.


The bowls should be wide and shallow to facilitate the dipping and coating process.
If desired, you can also season the cornmeal with a dash of salt, pepper, and paprika.
 Dunk each thigh into the flour, egg, and cornmeal, in that order.


Remove the thigh from the buttermilk, holding it above the bowl to allow excess buttermilk to drip off.
Cake both sides of the thigh with flour. The flour keeps the coating on better. Hold the thigh above the bowl of flour, tapping it slightly against the side to remove excess.
Dunk the floured chicken into the egg wash. Allow excess to drip off by briefly holding the thigh above the bowl.
Dredge all sides of the thigh in the cornmeal. Make sure that it is completely coated.
 The chicken should be golden brown when it is finished, and the internal temperature should reach 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius).
 Let the chicken thighs rest on a plate covered in paper towels for 5 minutes to drain. Serve while still hot.

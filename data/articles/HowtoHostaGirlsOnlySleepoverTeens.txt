 Now the first step to any amazing sleepover is to ask your parents. If they say no. Don't keep whining and being a baby. Just be extra good and ask them later on in the month.;
, What's a sleepover without the guest list first. you don't want things getting out of hand do you now? no. Send invites through mail so no-one feels left out.
 How can you not have a sleepover without food and supplies huh? You can't. Remember to stock up on cakes, Cadbury's, sweets, pretzels, fudge, cookies, brownies, toffee apples, nail polish, lip gloss, mascara, foundation, eyeliner, blusher, eyeshadow, eyelash curlers, Tango, coke, Pepsi max, water oh the list is endless.
 Introduce your parents and maybe siblings and pets. Tell them now if there's a rule about shoes. Set ground rules and stick to them.
, Get the mags out. Great mags are girl talk and we love pop.

 Bullet point the negatives and the positives you find in your suitor. There should always be a longer list of positives if you want to maintain a healthy relationship.


Keep adding to the list because everyday you could learn something positive or negative about your suitor.
After a fight take a look at the list. It may help you appreciate what you have, or realize what you're lacking.
This is a great exercise to put your relationship into a logical perspective. It may come in handy in times of stress. You might realize it's not your partner making you miserable, it's actually, for example, your job or your diet.
 Your perfect match should complement your current status and help you flourish.Relationships are not stagnant, they will roll and fluctuate with progression and regression. But ultimately you want to find your relationship make positive leaps and bounds.


Think about important aspects like:

Does your suitor support your goals?
Will your suitor push you to reach new heights?
Does your suitor inspire you?



, Remember the Golden Rule, "treat others the way you would like to be treated". If those you are pursuing lack major components that are important to you, do not overlook this.


Pay attention to how your love interest treats others. Your suitor may treat you well, but if others are treated with disrespect, take that into future consideration.
Think about what your suitor's relationships are like with their friends and family. Depending on circumstance, this could give you good insight into how your relationship might turn out.

 Omegle allows you to choose interests so you can be matched with people who like similar things. But beware: some interests are more dangerous than others, so proceed at own risk. Religion and other controversial topics are especially prone to extremists, trolls, and people you don't want to meet.

If you notice there are lots of trolls or bots with a certain interest, remove it and try again after a week.;
, Saying "ASL" or "I'm horny" isn't a good start. You could say "Hi."or simply "Hello, what's up?"

, After introducing yourself, say something like, "I don't want to be rude, but if you are horny, can't speak English, or don't want to actually have a conversation, please disconnect."

, There are key ways to point out people who are trolls. They may say something very random and offensive at the start of the conversation, or simply say "I'm horny". They usually type first, and type often, as well. Bots leave automated messages and are often instant replies that don't relate to the subject.
 If the person you are talking to seems to be weird, simply disconnect. Also, if the person starts a conversation by saying "asl" they are most likely looking for someone to have cyber sex with.
 Some people may say something random, so play along. If it is offensive, disconnect, but sometimes the best conversations start the weirdest.
 They may send you a message saying Omegle has tracked your IP address, or that Omegle has classified them as a sex offender, usually ending with fake contact information. These are all fake, don't be tricked.
 You'll come across the people who seem to be honest, the obvious liars, the trolls, the horny people, the people looking for a laugh, the people who say they are on the verge of suicide, the people who are going through boredom and the normal people. Learn how to handle the people and you can turn almost any conversation into a fun one.

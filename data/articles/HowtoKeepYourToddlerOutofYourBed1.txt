 Her answer might make overcoming this challenge much easier. Keeping communication open between you and your child may also help her to feel safer, which is important when your are trying to overcome a challenge like this together.


For example, if your child thinks there is a monster under her bed, and she feels safer in your bed, then “kill” or send the monster on his way in order to make your child feel more comfortable. (The process of doing this will be described later in the article).;
, Explain to your child that you expect her to sleep in her own bed, all night long. Remind her that nighttime is for sleeping, not for walking around the house from bed to bed. Also remind her that your bed is only big enough for sleeping adults, and that your bed does not have enough space for her at night.


Tell your child that even though you both may be sleeping in different beds, you are only a little ways away, and that you are always there for her.
Tell your child that you expect her to stay in bed all night because you want her to have lots of energy for all the fun activities you are going to do with her tomorrow.
 Praise characters that sleep all night long in their own beds. You can purchase specific picture books that deal with the issue of a child staying in her own bed all night long.
 Say things that might deter your child from wanting to sleep in your bed, like the fact that Daddy snores, or that Mommy rolls around a lot and might squish anyone who gets in her way.


Remind your child that she could get hurt walking around the house in the dark, which is another reason why she should stay in bed.
 Alternatively, talk to your child about how comfy and spacious her bed is. Say that you wish you could sleep in here, but that the bed is made specifically for your child, and that you wouldn’t fit in it.


Praise your child’s strength for sleeping in her own bed, and tell her how lucky she is to have such a soft, warm bed to sleep in.

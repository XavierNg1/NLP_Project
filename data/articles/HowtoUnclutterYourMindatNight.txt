 This old trick is an easy and efficient way to help the mind unclutter. Breathe out all the unneeded, unwanted information. Repeat as much as you need.
 You can try any type of meditation. The goal to aim for is about five to ten minutes before bed toÂ feel your stress melt. More time is always accepted, of course. Not only does meditation clear your brain, but it also leaves you happy and refreshed. Find a quiet room and meditate for as long as you can., List all the good things that happened today. Maybe you did what you wanted or managed to figure something out. If you're stressed out about tomorrow, write down what you're going to do tomorrow to save time and worry., It doesn't have to be much. Just a little notebook where you write your thoughts down before you go to bed. Right before you turn the lights off, start writing.

Writing everything down will calm down your mind, assuring that everything is in place, even when it isn't.
You can write gibberish or whatever you feel is consuming too much space in your mind.
Think of your bed journal as a recycle bin. It's a place for unwanted thoughts that can, however, still be useful. Write anything and everything.
Keep the bed journal on your nightstand or wherever you can access it if needed.
If you wake up during the night and can't make yourself go back to sleep, start writing in your journal until you feel drowsy and your mind grinds to a halt.

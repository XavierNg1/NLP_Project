 There are several types of polishes, but cream polishes work best to moisturize and add shine to your boots. Find a leather cream polish in the same color as your boot, or a neutral polish that isn’t colored.Only cowboy boots with a finish should be polished. Don’t polish suede, naked or nude finished leather, patent or micro suede leather.
The advantage of using a colored polish is that it can restore color to faded boots.
 Just like with the conditioner, add a dollop of polish to a clean white cloth and rub it into your boots. Add another thin layer if you want more shine., Follow the directions on the package to either wipe away excess polish or let it set into the boot. Don’t wear the boots until your boots are dry to the touch.

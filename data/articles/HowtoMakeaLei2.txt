 To make a crepe paper lei, you will need strips of colored crepe paper ( 20 long and 2 wide) — the number of strips you need will depend on how long you want your finished lei to be. You will also need a needle and thread and a pair of scissors.
 Take one strip of crepe paper and fold it, accordion-style, along the entire length. Each fold should be about 1/4 inch in length.
 Pass the thread through the eye of the needle, double it and tie a knot at the end. You'll need approximately two yards of thread, but again this will depend on how long your want your finished lei to be.
 Push the crepe paper to the end of the string.
 Use your hands to open the threaded piece of crepe paper slightly, then twist it clockwise to form flower-shaped twirls. Try to keep the crepe paper twisted as tightly as possible — this will produce a fuller-looking lei.
 Take a second strip of crepe paper, in a different color (or the same color, if you prefer) and repeat the process of folding, threading and twisting. Keep going with each piece of crepe paper until you have filled the thread.
 Once you have filled the thread with twisted crepe paper (this may take up to an hour, depending on how tightly packed the twists are), pass the needle through the crepe paper at the opposite end and tie a knot to close the lei. Cut off the excess string.

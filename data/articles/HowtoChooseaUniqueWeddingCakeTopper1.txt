 On top of being unique, this can also be a romantic way of remembering how you and your significant other met. You can use an item from that day as a reminder of it, or you might want to print a high-quality picture of the place you met, attach this to a skewer, and use that as the topper instead.


When using a high-quality picture, you may want to use Photoshop to add a little message or explain the topper. Something as simple as “Where we met, and now, together forever” can make your choice in topper more obvious to guests.;
, This can be a nice way of remembering a family member who’s passed on or a family tradition. Beyond these reasons, heirlooms are often ornate, which means they won’t look out of place topping your cake.Be sure you clean these thoroughly before using them as a topper. If you plan on using jewelry, you may want to have the piece cleaned by a jeweler first.
Some heirlooms might be able to nest right on top of the cake. However, in some cases you may need to attach the item to skewers to make it more visible.
 If you have a close connection with your home state, or if you and your partner are from different states, this can be a fun way of remembering your roots. Make cut outs of your home states, mark your home town with a star, and complete the topper with your initials written somewhere on each cut out.These toppers can be made easily with high-quality paper and then attached to the cake with skewers or toothpicks.
You may want to use card stock or some kind of rigid paper for this topper idea. Otherwise, the paper might not stay upright.
 If you or your fiancé planned an extravagant proposal, you may remember this event fondly. Use a memento from that day as a topper, print out a picture of the location the proposal happened, or use a picture of the proposal itself.


If a friend or onlooker caught your proposal on film, you can use this image to commemorate the day you were engaged.

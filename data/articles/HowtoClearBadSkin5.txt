 You may have tried to cover up pimples with layer after layer of foundation, concealer, and powder. Unfortunately, this strategy can actually make the blemish more visible.


Instead, think about light-diffusing makeup, which will make your whole face look more luminous and will distract attention from pimples or other imperfections.
For pimples that are begging for concealer, use a concealer brush to dab just a tiny bit right on top of the pimple, then set with powder., Remember what you learned in art class — colors opposite each other on the color wheel can balance each other out. Today, this same logic has been applied to skincare products. The newest products will make you look balanced, not like an extra on Star Trek.If you’re worried about a sallow complexion, look for purple-tinted primers.
If redness is a problem, try a green-tinted product.
 These days, many makeup products pack a wallop in the skincare department, too. Find the product that addresses your particular issue.Acne sufferers will find products that contain skin-clearing salicylic acid, tea tree oil, and other compounds.
Mineral makeup contains zinc oxide to treat acne and will sit on top of pores rather than clogging them.
You’ll also find products geared toward treating uneven skin tone, fine lines and wrinkles, and more.
 If you’re applying makeup with dirty hands and/or brushes, you risk making acne and other conditions worse.Wash your hands before applying makeup (and touching your face in general).

Wash your brushes every two weeks to avoid oil and bacteria buildup. There are a number of products on the market just for this purpose, but soap and water will also do.
Your makeup becomes bacteria-ridden, too, so replace it every six months (three months for mascara).
 If you’re wearing makeup every day, your skin doesn’t have a chance to breathe. Take a break so you don’t get caught in a cycle where you keep needing even more makeup!

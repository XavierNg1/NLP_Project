, His trunk is long and curves round, with a heart-shaped end.
 The top of his mouth goes along the bottom of his trunk. Don't forget his tongue!

 His ears should go to the middle of his mouth.
 He has fingerless gloves and a flower on his jacket lapel.
 As a finishing touch, draw his bow tie.
 He has a short, stripey tail. His body is made of candy floss, so don't press too hard with the pencil while doing his body and use sweeping lines.
 He has short, stumpy legs that are stripey. The left foot is slanted upwards with the heel resting on the floor and the right foot is crouched down.
 Do some finishing touches. Draw texture lines on Bing Bong's body to represent the candy floss and do the criss-cross pattern on his jacket. You may wish to leave him in pencil but if you want to colour him in, look up pictures of him on the internet to do the proper colours.

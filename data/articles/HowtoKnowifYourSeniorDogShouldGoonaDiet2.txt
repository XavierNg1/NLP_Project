 If your senior dog has a health condition such as heart disease, diabetes, or liver disease, it is important to consult a veterinarian or veterinary nutritionist to help you formulate a diet. A professional can make dietary recommendations specific to your individual dog.
 If your senior dog has heart disease, it is best to feed them a diet lower in calories and sodium. Restricting sodium is particularly important, as dogs with heart disease can lose the ability to excrete salt from the body., If your senior dog has diabetes, it is important that they eat a diet that is low in fat and high in fiber. The goal of this diet is that it will delay the absorption of food, which helps blood sugar rise at a slower rate. Talk to your vet about what type of food you should buy for your dog.A higher-fiber diet can also be beneficial for senior dogs who struggle with constipation.
 If your dog struggles with joint pain and/or arthritis, you should consider feeding them a dog food that contains these supplements. You can also give your dog a glucosamine and chondroitin sulphate supplement, but make sure it is formulated for dogs and not for humans.While supplements are useful, dogs with arthritis and/or joint pain will benefit the most from weight management.

 Combine 1 ½ cups (355.5 g)  of citric acid, 1 ½ cups (355.5 g) of washing soda, ½ cup (209 g) of baking soda, and ½ cup (130 g) of sea salt in a large bowl or pot. Stir the mixture so all of the ingredients are well combined.If you don’t have sea salt, you can substitute kosher salt.
 When the detergent ingredients are fully mixed, carefully transfer it to a jar or other container. Make sure to choose a container with an airtight lid because the borax-free detergent is especially prone to clumping when exposed to high humidity.If you live in an area with high humidity, place 2 tablespoons (30 g) of powdered bentonite clay inside a piece of cheesecloth or pantyhose. Secure the fabric so the clay won’t spill out, and throw the packaged clay into your container of detergent. The clay will absorb the excess moisture so the detergent doesn’t clump.
 When you need to wash a load of dishes, place 1 tablespoon (15 g) of the detergent mixture in the dishwasher’s detergent cup. Set the dishwasher as you normally would, and allow the cycle to run.

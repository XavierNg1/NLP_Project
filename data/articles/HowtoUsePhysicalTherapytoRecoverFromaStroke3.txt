 Sit down on a bench with a book on either side of you. The books should be roughly the same size. Place your hands on the books. Lean to one side, shifting your weight to that side. Gently return to center before shifting your weight to the other side. Do this ten times.


You can also practice shifting forward and back. With your hands on the books, gently lean forward while keeping your hips straight. Then slowly move into a small back lean., Sit on a bench or firm bed. Lean on your arm so that your forearm is resting straight against the surface; you can place a pillow under your elbow if it hurts. With your hand, push down against the surface so that your arm straightens and your body rises. Slowly bend the elbow back down until you are in the original position.If you are having shoulder problems, do not try this exercise until you have strengthened your shoulder.
 While sitting on a firm chair, stretch your arms out in front of you and clasp your hands together. Lean forward slightly before straightening again. Try this five times every day until you have regained your balance., When you are comfortable with leaning forward, you can try standing as you reach out. Keep your hands clasped, and slowly rise as high as you can from the chair. If you cannot stand completely yet, do not push yourself. Simply lower yourself back to the chair.Never try this unless you have someone there with you to catch you if you fall.

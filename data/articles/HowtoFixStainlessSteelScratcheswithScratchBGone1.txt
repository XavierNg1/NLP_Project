 Letting go of clip lever prematurely may result in injury.) Slowly release clamp to lock position. Repeat on other side of handle. Pad is secured when stretched tightly along grip base. The Grip handle can be used horizontally or vertically as long as your pad strokes follow the direction of the grain.
 Apply small amount to pad in an “S” pattern. Keep just enough ULTRA SHINE on pad to maintain cutting effectiveness during restoration process. ULTRA SHINE leaves surfaces dry to the touch upon wiping. Do not use ULTRA SHINE on 1” x 6” Finger Strip. Tightly secure bottle cap on unused ULTRA SHINE and store in a cool dry place.

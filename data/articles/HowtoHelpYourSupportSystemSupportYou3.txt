 Let your support system know that you’ll be there for them when they need you. Ask what they need the most help with in their lives, and follow through if they make a request.Sometimes people avoid asking for help simply because they don’t want to inconvenience others. If your loved ones say they don’t need anything, check in with them every once in a while, so they know your offer of support is genuine.
 Spend time with the people in your support system regularly, and be sensitive to what your friends and family are going through. If you think a loved one could use a hug or some help around the house, don’t wait for them to ask – reach out and offer your support.For instance, if your friend has been acting sad lately, you could take them out for coffee and ask if everything is okay.
 To keep your relationships healthy, talk with your friends and family about what kind of help you and they are comfortable giving and receiving. Establishing your expectations and needs will prevent misunderstandings later and help everyone feel respected.For example, you might refuse to borrow money from family members because you don't want to complicate your relationships. You might tell a loved one who offers, "I have a rule about not accepting money from family. I really appreciate the gesture, but I can't accept this."
By communicating and standing firm in your own boundaries, you give your loved ones a model for which they can build their own.

 A non-corrosive acid cabinet is the best place to keep acids. This will help you separate acids from other chemicals. This is an important safety note, as chemicals produce vapors and what’s “in” a container does not necessarily stay there., Some acids, such as chromic acid, are strong oxidizers. This means that they will react very readily with most organic materials, as well as any strong reducers. These reactions will most likely be violent in nature and result in fire, explosion, etc., Bases and active metals (such as alkali earth metals) will react violently with acids. These chemicals are nucleophilic (proton deficient), and acids donate protons by definition. You should also keep acids separate from any reagents that will mix with an acid to form toxic gases. Bleach is a perfect example., Most acids (but not all) are stored in glass containers. You should place those containers in an unbreakable secondary container, such as a plastic crate. This will prevent accidentally shattering the glass and spilling acid.
 Shaking and jarring containers of acid could certainly be considered pushing your luck. Using an elevator is much safer than using stairs, however, only the person transporting the acid should be in the elevator. Should there be an accident, fewer people trapped in the elevator is better.
 Labeling acids (and all chemicals) is a good way to remember what material is stored in each bottle. Even if you are sure you won’t forget, someone else may come along and mistakenly pick up your bottle. This is an important safety step that should not be ignored.

 You may already have one growing in your yard or you might have to purchase one. Choose an aloe plant with mature leaves growing near the base of the plant. If there are no leaves growing at the root of the plant, then it is not ready for harvesting.


Aloe vera plants are inexpensive and don't require much care. They are a type of succulent, which need lots of light, but little water. Aloe vera plants can last for years if well cared for.;
, You'll need to cut, not tear, the leaves. Choose healthy green leaves near the base of the plant and cut at an angle., Leave the plant for 10 to 15 minutes. The gel will slowly leak from the leaf into your container.


If you cut too many aloe leaves and need to store them, simply wrap the leaves in foil or place in a sandwich bag. Refrigerate them for up to five days., Using a sharp knife, cut off the tip and rough sides of the leaf. Then slice lengthwise through the leaf. You'll then want to scrape the gel into your container.
 Fill the ice cube tray with the aloe gel before you hit the beach/pool in the morning or the evening before. Take a proactive approach so that if you are in pain you can reach for relief immediately.

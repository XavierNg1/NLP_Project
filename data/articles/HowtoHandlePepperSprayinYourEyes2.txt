 The water temperature should be warm, not hot or cold, and should be a temperature that is comfortable for you to flush your eyes for a long time.There are a couple different methods you can use to flush your eye:


Stand under a shower.
Put your face under a faucet with running water.
Spray your open eyes with a kitchen sink sprayer or a garden hose very gently.
Fill a tub or pan with water and then immerse your face in it with eyes open.
Pour water from a pitcher, jug, or water bottle over your open eye., If it is still painful after fifteen minutes, consult a physician. Some sources, however, argue that pain is normal for up to two hours after pepper spray exposure to the eyes.

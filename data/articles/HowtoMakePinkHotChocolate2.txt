 Make the milk powder by pouring the milk powder package into a small saucepan. Add the specified amount of water noted on the package. Often, one package will require one cup of water.Warm up the milk powder in the water on low heat until it dissolves, stirring constantly.
 Strawberry flavored Nesquik will allow you to make the hot chocolate pink and strawberry flavored. You can find strawberry flavored Nesquik online or at your local grocery store. Dissolve the Nesquik in the milk powder and water in a small saucepan. Use a spoon or a whisk to do this.
 Once the milk powder and the Nesquick have been combined, pour in the instant pudding. This will give the drink a white chocolate flavoring. Stir the instant pudding until it dissolves.
 Pour the pink hot chocolate into mugs. Then, add toppings like mini-marshmallows, whipped cream, and sprinkles. If you are preparing the drink for a friend or loved one, you may let them add their own toppings as they see fit.

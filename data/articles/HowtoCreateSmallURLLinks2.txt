 You'll find this located at tinyurl.com. You'll find a welcome message and a couple of text boxes at the center of the page., Simply enter the original web address into the text box that says "Enter a long URL to make tiny." Once you've copied and pasted said address into the text box, simply click the "Make TinyURL!" button to the right. You'll be sent to a new screen with an abbreviated URL and an alternate "preview" version of that URL.


If there are any errors contained in your original URL (like spaces), TinyURL will present you with fixed options once you hit the "Make TinyURL!" button.
You may wish to customize the abbreviated URL with wording that better reflects the link in question. To do so, enter your preferred wording in the text box labeled "Custom alias (optional)" before clicking on the "Make TinyURL!" button.
 This optional process will leave a button on your browser's links toolbar that expedites the creation of abbreviated URLs. To do so, click on the "Make Toolbar Button" on the main page's lefthand menu. Then follow the instructions by dragging the specified link to your toolbar. Upon doing so, you can create an abbreviated URL for the page you're currently on by clicking the toolbar button.


Your links toolbar may not be currently visible depending on your preferences. To enable it, select View from your browser's menu and then click on the Toolbars menu to make it visible.
If you're unable to place the link on your toolbar or prefer it to be located among your bookmarks, you can also drag the place the link in your favorites or bookmarks folder for easy access. This may be a worthwhile investment for anyone using Bitly for business purposes.

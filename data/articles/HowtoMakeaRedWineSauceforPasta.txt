Preheat a deep, nonstick saucepan over medium heat. Add olive oil and let the oil heat for a few minutes.;
,


Add minced garlic to the heated olive oil. Saut√© for 2-to-3 minutes, stirring continuously, until the garlic has softened and starts to become translucent.
Reduce the heat if the garlic starts to turn brown or smell bitter. This means the garlic is cooking too fast and is starting to burn, which could make your sauce taste bitter.



Pour crushed tomatoes into the pan. Stir to incorporate the garlic into the tomatoes. Cook the tomatoes over medium heat for 10 minutes or until they're heated through.



Add salt, pepper, basil, oregano and red pepper flakes to the tomatoes. Stir the tomatoes well to incorporate the seasonings evenly throughout the sauce.
Taste the sauce and adjust the seasonings to your taste. Add more red pepper flakes to make the sauce spicier or more basil and oregano to enrich the herb flavor.



Gently pour wine into the tomato sauce. Stir the mixture thoroughly to work the wine into the sauce.



Add a heavy lid to the saucepan.
Reduce the heat under the saucepan to low.
Simmer the red wine pasta sauce on low heat for 30 minutes.



Cook your pasta of choice while the sauce is simmering. Strain the pasta well and portion it onto plates or pour it onto a serving platter.



Pour the finished red wine sauce over the pasta. Serve with Parmesan cheese.

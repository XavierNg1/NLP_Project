  You can use a compass, trace a cup or glass, or free-hand it.  Whatever works for you.  Add a few, curved lines in between the two circles.  This gives it that tied-together look.;
,,  Most dreamcatchers have a flower pattern as a basis, but you can do whatever you want.
  Add prints inside you lines.  Be creative with your lines and drawings! Remember: there is no right or wrong.  Zentangle is extremely free-spirited!

,, These are for your feathers to "hang" onto.  You can do as many as you want - a few strung in a row, or a whole bunch over-lapping.
 Divide your feathers into sections.  Fill each division with a pattern or print.  Don't be afraid to go a little wild!

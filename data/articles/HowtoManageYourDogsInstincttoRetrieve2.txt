 Another way you can control your dog’s retrieval habits is to encourage them to retrieve only their toys and leave other items alone. To do this, you may play with them using their toys and encourage your dog to fetch their toys. Play fetch with your dog indoors and outdoors. This will get them used to retrieving their toys, rather than other items.If your dog does go towards an item they are not supposed to pick up, use the “leave it” command.
You can also try distracting your dog away from the item by holding up their toy and calling their name or saying “come.”
If your dog knows the “no” command, you may also use it to discourage them from picking up items other than their toys.
 You can also get your dog to stop retrieving items they are not supposed to by getting them to focus on treats instead. Carry treats in your pocket while you walk your dog. If they come across an item and start to try to retrieve it, distract them by pulling a treat out of your pocket. Encourage your dog to walk away from the item by holding up the treat and give it to them once they continue on the walk. Often, dogs will react better to being distracted from items rather than yelled at or yanked away from the item.You can also get your dog to focus on treats instead of items by asking, “What do you have there?” or “What’s that?” when your dog starts to pick up an item. Then, take out a treat and offer it to your dog instead.
 If you are still struggling to get your dog to leave items alone and stop retrieving items they shouldn’t, you may need to create an outdoor area that is free of these items. You may have a fenced in yard that does not contain any food, garbage, or other items that your dog may be prone to retrieving. You could then limit your dog to going outside and playing in this area so they do not pick up any items they shouldn’t.

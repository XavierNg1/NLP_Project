, Everyone likes a person that is always being kind to strangers and helpful to those in need.
 No one wants to feel like they are being judged, a bother, or intolerable. If you have an air of tolerance, people will think of you to be a kind, nice, and polite person.
 Home and fix. in work, school and somewhere

,, If you are given an object, a letter, gifts or compliments always say thank you. This shows you appreciate that someone has taken the time to give you a gift, or notice you. If you are asking for something, always say please. Stay calm when you speak and never shout. If you burp in a public place, always say "Pardon me."

, Whether it's a senior citizen struggling with heavy shopping bags, or your mother who is looking tired mopping the floor, offer to help. If someone kindly turns your gesture down, smile politely and walk away.
 If you want to talk on your phone, only do so when you're in your bedroom,home or in place where you are alone. Never talk on your phone while you're driving. Not only is this bad manners and very dangerous, it's also illegal in many places and a bad idea. Instead, purchase a headset, so you can easily and safely chat while driving. If you're eating, keep your phone out of reach.
 If someone is older than you, or of a different religion, be just as polite as you would be to someone who was your age or your religion.
,, If a friend is in need, offer them some gum and ask if they want to talk about it with them. This not only makes you look kind, but it is a very sympathetic act.
 Open the doors for strangers. Give the last brownie to that person next to you. Compliment people about their clothing, new haircut, rose garden, or delicious homemade cookies. Not because you want them to like you, but because you actually like whatever it is your complimenting them on.

 You can eliminate all of these if you try hard enough.;
, if neither of these are possible, just try to keep your hair out of the smoke. After smoking, use spray deodorant or citrus spray or something to mask the smell (but don't over-do it)

, Remove any jackets or scarves or anything you can, so they don't absorb the smoke. After smoking you can use dryer sheets or an odor eliminator spray to remove the smell. Febreze works best because it neutralizes odor instead of masking it.
 Really there isn't much you can do about it except showering, or using lotion/deodorant.
 Again, don't over-do it because it can be obvious your hiding something (sometimes you can be tricked into thinking you smell when its just your breath, because your mouth and nose are connected)

, Use a piece of paper or a wrapper or something to keep any part of the object being smoked from touching your hand. The smell is especially transferred when inhaling.
 If you don't know what that is, it's a toilet paper tube or any tube filled with lots of dryer sheets. You exhale through this device and the smoke leaves it with a fresh scent.

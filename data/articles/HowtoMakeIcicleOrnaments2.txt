 For best results, use a clear bottle. A translucent blue bottle may also work. Don't worry if the bottle has any bumps or ribs. Make sure that there is no paper or glue residue left on the bottle, however.
 Don't worry about being too neat here; you will fix any jaggedness in the following step.
 Taper the strips slightly so that they are flat at one end, and pointy at the other, just like real icicles. They should be no wider than 1 to 1Â½ centimeters (2.54 to 3.81 inch) at the widest point., Hold the strip close enough so that it heats up, but not so close that it starts to melt or burn. Keep the tapered/pointed part of the strip closest to the flame.Use a short, stubby pillar candle instead of a long candlestick. It will be less likely to tip over.
 Pull gently on the ends so that they don't warp or bend. You want the icicle and coil, but you don't want it to curve or bend., You should now have a coiled strip of plastic. Don't get disappointed if your first one doesn't turn out perfect; some people need a few tries to get it right., Hold a needle or nail over a candle flame until it gets hot, then use it to poke a hole through the top part of your icicle. Wait for the plastic to cool before moving on., You can use any color you want, but white, silver, or clear thread would look the best. If you'd like to make a garland instead, make several icicles, then thread them onto a long piece of string instead.

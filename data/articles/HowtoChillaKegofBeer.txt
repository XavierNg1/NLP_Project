 To chill a keg, you will need a large, durable container into which the keg will fit with a little room surrounding it. The best option is buying a specialized keg tub, which can be found at many liquor stores and home brewing supply stores.


Another ideal container is a large trash can. Most high-capacity outdoor trash cans can easily fit a keg of beer inside with room to spare.
A third option is placing the keg of beer directly into a bathtub in your home. This will prevent you from having to procure a separate container, but will of course require your guests to fill their beer glasses from your bathroom.;
, After you have prepared a keg tub, pour a layer of ice into the bottom of the tub about 12 inches (30 cm) thick. This ice will rest underneath the keg and help keep it chilled.
 Partner with 1 or 2 other people to lift the keg into the tub. Lift the keg carefully and slowly, keeping it upright throughout. Lower it as gently as possible onto the layer of ice in the keg tub. Moving the keg around too much can cause the beer to be too foamy when dispensed.
 After the keg is lowered into the keg tub, pour ice into the tub until the keg is being contacted by ice over as much of its surface area as possible.
 Ice alone will help chill the keg, but for the most effective chilling an ice water bath is preferable. Pour cold water over the ice in the keg tub until the water reaches the level of the ice.
 To keep the keg chilled throughout your party or gathering, add fresh ice to the keg tub if too much has melted away. Excess water can be removed either by scooping it out with a pitcher or by punching a drain hole near the bottom of your keg tub.

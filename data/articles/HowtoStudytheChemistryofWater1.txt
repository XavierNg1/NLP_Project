 Knowing what the chemical formula H2O actually means is important. It means that you need two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom to come together to make a water molecule. It also means that if you break apart a water molecule, you will get two hydrogens and one oxygen.Splitting water is often done with electricity in a process known as electrolysis.
Plants also split water to carry out photosynthesis.;
, The oxygen and hydrogens of a single water molecule are covalently bonded. That is to say that they share electrons. However, water molecules also experience intermolecular forces. The most important intermolecular force for water is the hydrogen bond. These bonds allow the hydrogens of one molecule to interact with the oxygen of another.Research suggests that one water molecule is likely to form hydrogen bonds with two others.
 Every chemical has a particular geometric shape. Water is no exception here. Each water molecule has what is referred to as a bent structure. The two hydrogens are forced closer than 180 degrees to each other because the oxygen has extra electrons that alter the shape.These unbonded electrons are known as “lone pair electrons.”

, Since oxygen holds electrons more effectively than hydrogen, they are not shared evenly. This creates a negative end (at the oxygen) and a positive end (at the hydrogens) on the water molecule. Molecules with a positive and negative pole are known as a polar molecules and they interact well with other polar molecules. This is why water is a great solvent for alcohol (a polar liquid), but a poor solvent for vegetable oil (a nonpolar liquid). , Water is amphoteric. This means that it can be either an acid or a base and will act differently depending on the environment. In acid environments, water displays basic properties (accepts protons). In a basic environment, water will act as an acid (donates protons).

 Look for support groups and counseling services that involve your peers who are affected by bipolar disorder. You might receive tips on how to get through obstacles and challenges you are experiencing in school. Meeting others who also have the same disorder as you may help you feel like you’re not alone and could stop you from becoming isolated if the depression starts to become too much.


Talk to your school counselor or contact the National Alliance on Mental Health Illness to find a support group in your area., Stay in touch with your family and friends regarding your condition. In addition, allow them to help, whether it is contacting your instructors when you have a problem or allowing them to clean and shop for you. Don’t feel bad about accepting help from those around you: they are doing it because they love you, and it allows you to focus on staying healthy.


If you are uncomfortable having your parent step up as your advocate, however, you’ll need to address the situation directly. Let them know that you appreciate the help, but it is overwhelming and preventing you from being able to stay focused on your health and school responsibilities., Visit the disability center at your school to document your illness. Doing so potentially allows you to connect with an advisor who can stay in contact with you to ensure you are maintaining your health.


Plus, if you’re having problems, the advisor may be able to help you speak with your instructors about what is going on.

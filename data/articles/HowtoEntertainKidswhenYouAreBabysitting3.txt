 Ask them what they like playing first- some children may not like things that are suggested to play.
 Older children about age 10 may enjoy board games or things that are not as energetic as the games that younger kids may like. Don't do anything that is too old for the kids because you want parents to want you to come back.


When playing with the kids, be sure to not be rough with them, especially when you have a younger age group. This may turn them off and somebody could get hurt.
Musical chairs is a fun game appropriate for all ages. Just make sure the chairs are small enough for the kids.
 Sit the kids down into a semi-circle and make funny faces. Whoever laughs first has to make silly faces with you. The last person not to laugh wins! Give all the kids a small prize, like a colorful band-aid or a half of a cookie.
 Have the kids "feed you lunch" by having them give you an already prepared snack, like fruit snacks and a juice box. Then let them decide the game you play next or what their snack is.
 A great game to play is called step one step two. You make up the first part of the song/story, then the next person makes up the second part of the story and so on.
 If you have a lot of children, play freeze tag, or a team game where everyone needs to be involved.

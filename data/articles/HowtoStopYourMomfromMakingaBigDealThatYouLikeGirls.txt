, For her, it's one more sign you are getting older and will leave the house in a few years. She loves you and this may makes her a bit sad.
 And that will mean happy things down the road like your senior prom, your first girlfriend, your wedding, and maybe having grandchildren one day.
 She might tease or act "all weird" because she doesn't quite know what do about this.
, In private, tell her what she's doing that is making you uncomfortable--she may not actually know you were embarrassed. Tell her yes, you are noticing girls, and you don't want her to make you feel weird about it. If she's a good mother, she'll try to avoid embarrassing you.(Note: Mothers will embarrass you from time to time no matter what. Sorry, it's true. Fortunately, everyone else's mother does too!)

, This will be uncomfortable but it's about her, not about you. Remind her you're still her boy, you love and need her. She might initially get even more emotional, because she'll get all happy that you love her, but at least she'll think you're the sweetest, most thoughtful son in the world.
 Brothers and sisters have a way of using the fact you like girls to be pests. Your mother should stand up for you, as there's nothing wrong about thinking girls are neat.
 When they make fun of you for wanting to kiss a certain girl, say something like: "Yeah, she is really cute, and I'd like to kiss her."

, (Bear in mind, if you like guys too, or just guys, this is perfectly normal; there are likely plenty of articles on this site to help you deal with this.)

, Growing up is the hardest part of any parent's life, so doing something like watching TV with her or do a small activity with her will help her adjust while reassuring her that you haven't forgotten about her. Remember, she's the girl that has been there from day one and will always love you.

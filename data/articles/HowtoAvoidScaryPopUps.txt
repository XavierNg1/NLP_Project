 According to videos, scary pops usually come at the end but some pops can come in the beginning or in the middle. In games, the pops might come up if you struck in the wrong place or at the end of the level or game.


Stop the video or don't play the game first (even if your brothers, sisters, and friends tell you to do it).
Look for signs that means it's a trick (e.g:youtube comments, subject or others).
Ask friends/family members, they may warn you.;

If it's unusually loud at the end or the middle part, it may be a trick.
 Sit in a place where you can see some, but not all, of the screen. Let it play.


If you see something pop up, then it's a pop-up trick.

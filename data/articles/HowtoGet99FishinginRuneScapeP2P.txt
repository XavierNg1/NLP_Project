 Fish crayfish from behind the Lumbridge church. You can obtain a crayfish pot from a man in a building right near the general store in Lumbridge for free! It won't take long to get level 5 fishing.;
, Once you are level 5, grab a fishing rod & some bait and head on over to Draynor Village and bait fish there. Bank the fish you catch so you can use them for cooking. You will catch sardines and herring.
 Get some feathers and a fly fishing rod and head to Barbarian village to fly fish. You will catch trout and salmon. To get from 1-40 shouldn't take long, only about 50 minutes.
 Choice A - You can just fly fish all the way to 99 and if you bank your items and sell them, you will get a profit of about 30-40mil. Choice B - From level 40-99 you can fish lobbies (lobsters) in Karamja and get a profit of about 70mil. Choice C - You can get 48 fishing and go to Otto's Grotto and barbarian fish (this is the fastest way).
 (Looks even more awesome trimmed.)

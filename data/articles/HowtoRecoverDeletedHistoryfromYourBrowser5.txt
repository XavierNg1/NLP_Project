Install professional recovery software, which may cost a bit, but stands a better chance of recovering any lost data.
Opt for professional data recovery services. Not only does this option cost a lot, it also means that you will have to send your hard disk to them.
 Regular backups is always the best option to avoid a scenario where recovering deleted data becomes too difficult or impossible.

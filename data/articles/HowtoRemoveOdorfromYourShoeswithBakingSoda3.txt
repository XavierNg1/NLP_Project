 The socks can be old or even mismatching, but they need to be clean and without any holes., Gently shake the socks to help get the baking soda all the way down to the toe area., You can also use a rubber band as well. Try to tie the socks off right above the bulge caused by the baking soda., You won't have to worry about getting baking soda everywhere., You can also leave them there for much longerâ€”up to 24 or 48 hours. During this time, the baking soda will absorb any bad odors., Keep in mind that the baking soda will eventually lose its deodorizing power. This is because it will have absorbed all of the odors in your shoes. You can expect the baking soda to last 1 to 2 months, however. Once the baking soda has lost its deodorizing power, you will need to dump the old baking soda out, and refill the sock with fresh baking soda.

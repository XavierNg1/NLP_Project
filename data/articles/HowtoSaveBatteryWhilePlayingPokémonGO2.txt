 Location services are highly energy-consuming for your phone, and while playing Pokémon GO, you will already have one open by default. Close any other map applications (such as Google Maps or Apple Maps) to keep location services' energy uses at a minimum., Vibrations use more of your phone's energy than rings. This can be draining both in the Pokémon GO app as well as when contacts or other apps send you notifications. To turn vibrations off:


On an iPhone, head to Settings -> Sounds. Turn off "Vibrate on Ring" and "Vibrate on Silent".
On an Android, head to Settings -> Accessibility -> Sound. Uncheck the phone's option to vibrate.
 Apps continue to use power even if you are not using them if they remain open. When playing Pokémon GO, close any apps you aren't using or frequently returning to. To do this:


On an iPhone, double tap the home screen button. Swipe upwards on any apps that you aren't using.
On an Android, go to Recent Applications. From there, tap and hold any apps you don't want open. Swipe to the right to close the app., By limiting your phone's brightness, you will use less power and drain its battery less quickly. To turn down your phone's brightness:


On an iPhone, head to Settings -> Wallpaper & Brightness. Turn off Auto-Brightness and drag the brightness bar to its lowest option.
On an Android, go to Settings -> Device -> Brightness. Adjust your brightness to be at its lowest setting.

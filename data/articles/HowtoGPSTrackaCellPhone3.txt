 If you have a Windows phone with an associated Microsoft Account, you can track the phone through the web interface available at the Windows Phone website.
 This is located in the upper-right corner of the page. Select "Find My Phone" from the menu. You will be asked to sign in with your Microsoft account. Ensure that you sign in with the same account that is linked with your phone.
 Once your phone has been located, the map will center on it and the phone details will be displayed above the map. You have several options to choose from:


Print - This will print the map showing the last known location of the phone.
Ring - This will make your phone ring, making it easier to find if it is lost nearby.
Lock - This puts a new lock code on your device, keeping others from accessing it. You can also include a message that will appear on the lock screen.
Erase - This will wipe the data from your phone in case it is completely lost or stolen. Be careful when selecting this option, as it is irreversible.

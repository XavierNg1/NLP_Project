 After you talk to your parents, they might decide to punish you. You should gracefully accept their punishment. Dealing with your punishment in a mature way shows them you can handle the responsibility of driving.


Say: “I understand that I have to accept the consequences.”
Don’t whine when you’re told what your punishment is.
 You might tell your parents that you want to go to driving school so you won’t get points on your license. Going to driving school can reduce your insurance premiums. It also demonstrates how serious you are about keeping your license and having a clean driving record.


Do some research and show your parents what you found out about driving school.
Make a plan for getting to driving school and paying for it so they know you are serious.
 Pay the ticket if you can afford it. If you don’t have enough money, offer to pay what you can. Taking this level of responsibility for your ticket is the best way to show that you can handle the responsibility of driving.


If you want a job, this might be a good time to talk to your parents about getting one so that you can pay for car-related expenses.
Ask your parents if you can gradually pay them back for the ticket. Setting up a definite plan to pay them back is another way to show your maturity and that you can handle the consequences of your actions.

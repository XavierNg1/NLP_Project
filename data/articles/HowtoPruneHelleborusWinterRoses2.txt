 In order to avoid unwanted seedlings, prune off the flowers as they begin to fade or die. This type of pruning is commonly called deadheading. Deadheading also helps the plant put its energy towards new blooms, rather than trying to keep the old blooms alive.Cut the stems all the way off at the base.


Any flowers that are left on the plant will drop seeds onto the soil and new seedlings will emerge around the parent plant the following spring.
 The seedlings that grow from dropped seeds the previous season can be allowed to grow. However, they should be carefully dug up and moved as soon as they are large enough to handle to prevent overcrowding.
 If you remove the seeds from your roses, you can collect those seeds and grow them in a greenhouse.


Keep in mind that the seedlings may not look like the parent plant. Seeds from hybrid plants often produce plants that look like winter roses from a previous generation.

 Both give you a safety rating for the sites you are on and give a rating on your Google searches as well, from green (safe) to red (dangerous). Web Security Guard will have a pop-up saying that if a particular website has been reported as dangerous. You can choose to continue and go to the site or don't go to the site. One example of a dangerous site is smileycentral.com. One example of a safe site is https://www.google.com. Web Security Guard will also have a gold "shield" if the website has been reported but is not severely dangerous and will not give you pop-up about the website.

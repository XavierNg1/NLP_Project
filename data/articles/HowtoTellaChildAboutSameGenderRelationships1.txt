 Provide honest, factual answers, and keep it as short as is reasonable.;
, Treat it the same way you'd treat questions like "Why do people get married?" or "Why do people have crushes?" This sends the message that same-gender couples are normal, and nothing to get worked up about.
 Frame a relationship as one of responsibilities, personalities, identities and mutual support and caring - things that make everyone human. Don't discuss LGBT+ sex in a way you wouldn't discuss heterosexual sex.


If your child is curious about sex, then give them honest and accurate information. If they turn out not to be straight, they may have a same-sex relationship, and you'll want them to get information from a reliable source.
 The most credible answers to any child about sexual orientation are answers that are solely informative based on credible information, and are without any agenda, political affiliation or religious dogma. Keep out rhetoric or judgment.


Look to credible sources such as the American Psychological Association (APA) when looking for facts.
 Most kids are only looking to understand the basics, and if they want greater detail in an area, they'll ask. Simple is usually the best. They are two people who love and care about each other.


More inquisitive or older children may be interested in marriage, taxes, sex, and other issues. Young children probably aren't ready for this.

 There are many auto parts stores that accept your old battery as a deposit toward a new one. If you need to replace your battery, wrap it in plastic and bring it to the auto parts store you intend to buy the new battery from.You may want to call the auto parts store first to ensure they accept old batteries as a deposit.
Be sure to drive the battery to the store wrapped in plastic and sitting upright.
 Speak to the clerk at the front desk to get help finding the specific size battery you will need in your vehicle. Provide them with the year, make and model of the vehicle, as well as the engine type if you know it.If you are unsure of the type of engine you have in your vehicle, refer to the owner’s manual for assistance.
 When you purchase the new battery, the store will charge you an additional fee unless you provide a “core” battery as a deposit. The old battery you brought serves as that core. Trade them the battery in exchange for a lower price on your new one.The store will have the battery drained and refurbished to be sold again as a new battery.
You may have to pay more for a battery if you do not choose to recycle your old one through the auto parts store.

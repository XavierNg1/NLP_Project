 If you’re on an Android or iOS device, you can use the Emoji symbols built into your phone’s touch keyboard. Tap the round smiley-face on the keyboard, then scroll to the right until you locate the heart.


If you’re using an iPhone or iPad but don’t see the Emoji keyboard, you’ll need to enable it first.
, This will work on any platform. One of the most common ways to make a heart is by typing <3. Similar to the famous : ) emoticon, the <3 looks like a heart when flipped on its side.


If you want to express heartbreak instead of love, type </3 to make a broken heart., Add some style to your <3 by including other symbols, such as (*~<3~*. You could also try <333 if you're really feeling the love!

, If you have characters to spare, just type it: "I {heart} this!" While it takes up more space, it has its own style that may work better in some cases.


You can, of course, use all of these ideas in one tweet! Your followers will ♥ ♡♥ ♡♥ that!

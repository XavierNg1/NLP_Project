 Whatever you want to use for the base of your card -- cardstock, printer paper, scrapbook paper -- will be fine. Just make sure it can support the weight of your pop up!








, You can rummage through your scrap papers for this part; your pop up should be about half the size of your card. If the paper is too big, cut it to size. Once you've found one that fits your needs, fold it in half, short ends together, just like you did with the primary card.
 For this method we'll use a heart shape. Draw half the heart with the center on the fold; cut it out, open it up, and fold it the other direction. Your heart needs to be very bendy as it's doing the popping!








, These are tabs at the bottom of your heart that will make it pop up when the card is open. About 1/4" (.6 cm) from the bottom, draw a 45Â° angle both ways, starting from center. If you have a knitting needle or bone folder, score the paper on that line. If you don't, just form a really firm crease.









Fold it back and then fold it forward along that crease. This is the tab that will attach the heart to the card.
 Make sure the center of your heart matches up with the center of the card! The tab should be facing out, visible when opened. After all, it completes the shape of the heart.









When the heart is attached, force it to fold outward and down. That way, when the card closes, it hides in the center.
Glue does work, but it's much messier and less reliable.
 Pop up complete, now it's just time to add your message and final touches! Write on the front, the heart, or anywhere in between. Sprinkle on some glitter, a ribbon, or whatever you can find in your craft drawer. DIY success!

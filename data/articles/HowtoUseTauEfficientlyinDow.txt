 Tau are very expensive in terms of both power and requisition (an 8-man fire-warrior squad costs nearly 1000 req.!!!) A good starting point on a 4-player map is about 4 SPs captured by 3 stealth-teams, which should be built and dispatched immediately. keep these teams moving and capture as many points as you can before the enemy starts crusading around the map.;
, A good commander doesn't lose a man, avoids fighting and causes minimal destruction. I personal build a nice big, balanced force on the fringes of my base's nearest SPs, and send an expeditionary force of about 5-6 beefed-up Stealth-teams buzzing around the map and into the enemy base. some Devilfish transports are an excellent distraction to your main sneaky assault, as some players think they're getting swamped when all those burst cannon tracers start hammering their guys and they can't see what the hell is shooting at them.
 Capture the enemies source of economy and stop them from reinforcing their front lines. whether you're using the proposed stealth-tactic above or an augmented version of your own, it always pays to have the player breaking out in sweat when he sees the second, bigger force rock up behind his troops and start killing off his dreadnoughts.
 Don't forget to use their jet packs, and don't be afraid to venture into the middle of the map as all the other players are usually too scared to go there. but, NEVER UNDERESTIMATE YOUR OPPONENT!!

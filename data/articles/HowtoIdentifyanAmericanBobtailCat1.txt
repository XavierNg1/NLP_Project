 The most distinctive characteristic of the American bobtail cat is the short tail, which is about a third to half the length of the average cat tail. The tail may be straight, slightly curved or slightly bumpy.Every cat has a slightly different tail, but they are all quite short.;
, One of the reasons this cat looks like a bobcat is that it has very long hind legs. The hind legs are a bit longer than the front legs, which gives them a very alert and dynamic stance., The eyes are wild looking and have an almond shape, which is quite distinctive. The brow and the eyes give the cat a hunting gaze and make it look very smart., If you look at the face of the cat, you will notice a fairly broad head, wedged inward, with soft whisker pads and a medium muzzle. You will also see a fairly well sculpted chin., If the cat is standing still, you will be able to see that it has a fairly rectangular stance. If you look at the chest, it will look pretty full compared to other cats. Looking at the long hind legs, you will notice that they are attached to hips fairly high up on the body., The coat may come in any color or pattern. They often have grey, brown or earth tones.

 This will require strength, as it can be secured quite tightly. If you don't want to keep the old grip, then tear it. Start tearing from lower end. When torn in half, remove the other part of grip by pulling it. , Hold the bat cone firmly with one hand. Pass the new grip onto the thin end of the bat cone while pulling it to full extension. Hold the bottom edge of the grip between the thumb and index finger of your other hand., Fold the rubber over itself until it forms an "O" shape. Leave only a small part of the grip unrolled at the top of the cone.
 Pass the grip back on the thin end of the bat cone, with the unrolled portion going on first.
 Do this step carefully, being sure not to roll or unroll it further. Slip the hollow edge of the bat cone over the butt end of your cricket bat.
 Push it onto the shaft of the bat without unrolling the grip. Do this until it reaches the shoulder of the bat., You will need to keep it tight so that it doesnâ€™t slip off. Be sure to align it flush against the edge of the shoulder., Now you are ready to unroll the grip down the handle of the bat using one hand, holding the grip firmly in place at the shoulder with the other hand.
 Cut off any excess grip hanging past the edge with scissors. Excess grip could get in your way while playing, so take your time to do this.
 Wrap electrical tape around the edge where the grip meets the shoulder to secure it in place. Your bat should now be ready for a game of cricket.

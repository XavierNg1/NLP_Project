 Put the bare-rooted phlox into boxes, buckets or pots and move them into the shade if you are transplanting on a hot, sunny day. Cover the plants with newspaper to help them retain moisture.


Mist the roots and the newspaper lightly with water if the plants are still waiting to be planted after a couple of hours.
, Enrich the soil with organic compost if necessary. Phlox prefer rich soil with good drainage.
, Make sure the crowns of the plants are at ground level, and fill the rest of the hole with soil.
 This prevents moisture from accumulating on the leaves. Phlox grown in areas without enough sun or ventilation or with too much moisture are prone to powdery mildew disease.


Space new plant clusters at least 3 to 5 feet (1 to 1.5 m) apart. You can space the divisions at least 10 inches (25 cm) apart if you are growing smaller clumps or single phlox in a row or border.
 Avoid getting the flowers and foliage wet.

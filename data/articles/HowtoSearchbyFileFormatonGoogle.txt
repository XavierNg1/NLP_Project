, For example, if you're interested in finding out what Android is, that will be your search query.
 For example, perhaps you'd like to get PDFs that explain what Android is and can do. PDFs are often a good choice because they may include articles, instructions, diagrams, and the like and can be easily downloaded for keeping.
 For the query used here, for example:


Type in the file type as: File Type:

Add the file type: File Type:PDF

Add the query: File Type:PDF What is Android?


, You'll then receive a bunch of returns focused on PDFs only, that should address at least some of your search query in the PDF contents.
 You can search for any specific file format using this trick.

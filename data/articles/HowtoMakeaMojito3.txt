 (30 ml) cream of coconut into a tall, sturdy glass. Make sure you shake the can of cream of coconut well, as it can settle while sitting in the can.Coconut milk and cream of coconut are not interchangeable, so don't try to substitute. Coconut milk is too thin and doesn't have the rich thickness of cream of coconut.There is a difference between "coconut cream" and "cream of coconut". Coconut cream is unsweetened, and cream of coconut is very sweet, almost like condensed milk. If you can only find coconut cream, you will have to sweeten it quite a bit before it is suitable for a cocktail.If you can only find cream of coconut in powder form, mix it with a little water so it is thick and has the consistency of condensed milk. Taste it before you add it to your drink to make sure it is sweet enough., The room will fill with the aroma of mint when the essential oils are released. This will signal you to stop muddling.Take care not to press too hard or be too vigorous in your muddling. If the mint leaves are shredded and the veins tear, your drink will be bitter and taste like grass.If you don't have a muddler, use the back of a metal spoon or the end of a wooden spoon or rolling pin.If you are nervous about muddling, you can hold the mint leaves in the palm of one hand and clap your other hand on top of them. It won't be as effective, but this will bruise the leave enough to release some of the mint flavor.Allow your ingredients to sit for a few moments after muddling so the sugar can absorb the mint and coconut.



Mix the drink to incorporate all the flavors and prevent the cream of coconut from settle on the bottom of the glass. Your drink should turn a milky white.
 Garnish with a sprig of mint, a wedge of lime, or even a pinch of shredded coconut.

 Gather them legally. Do not steal these items. Look around your home or buy new, it doesn't matter where from or how you gather these items the important thing to aid you to relax all day is that you gather them. Get as many of each as you think you'll need, and then a little more, just in case.;
, If you don't have a long table, set things out on the floor. If you have two short tables, line them up to form the requisite empty 1.5 feet of space.
 Again, gather the snack food, fruit, drinks and edibles legally. You may like to pick fresh fruit from a local fruit farm or simply see what's in the fridge. Gather as much of these items as you think you will need.
 If you are unable to perform the feet of transforming yourself into items of clothing, simply dress yourself in pyjamas and fuzzy socks. If you believe you can relax all day without being dressed in these items, try wearing something else but be warned, you may not manage to relax the whole day if you don't. You might only manage to relax for 9-10 hours without pyjamas and fuzzy socks.
 Get them and get under the blanket with the hot water bottle full of hot water. Or, if it's the middle of summer and lovely and warm, don't bother.
 It's relaxing to not move from a sitting position all day for some woman and girls. Try it if you think you'll like it. You can also lay in bed, sit on a lounger in the garden or recline anywhere of your choosing. You may even find sitting on the sofa all day boring and not relaxing at all, so only follow this step if you are the kind woman or girl who likes sitting on the sofa all day long.
 Try to do so without getting up from the sofa if possible.

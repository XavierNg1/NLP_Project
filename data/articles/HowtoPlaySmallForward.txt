 First you need to make sure you got the right height and weight to play for an adult or young adult you want to be about 6'7-6'9 and about 245-260 lbs. For ages 12-14 you want to be about 5'6-5'8.;
, You need a whole bunch of practice first you need to be able to shoot from basically anywhere on that court so probably about 40% layup and up close 35% mid range and about 25% three point range.
 As a small forward you will be expected to cut or drive to the basket, and shoot the mid range shots. Maybe add in a sweep or a jab step and then drive or when your shooting add a little bit of fade to get space between you and your defender. Try to limit your 3 point shots unless you are weakly guarded. Remember when you're shooting BEEF: Balance, Eyes, Elbows and Follow through.
 Unless you are injured, you need to work out. Every small forward you see in the NBA has amazing bicep, tricep, chest, leg, forearm, back,and ab strength! Also get a good amount of carbs and protein and try to limit fatty foods.

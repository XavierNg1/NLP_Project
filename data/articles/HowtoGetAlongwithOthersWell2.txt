 Think of your manners as the coat of paint on your personality-- if you keep it clean and pleasant, it leaves a wonderful first impression when you meet someone.
 This tells them that you are interested in what they have to say and want to be comfortable around them. When meeting someone for the first time, make good eye contact and shake their hand firmly as you introduce yourself.
, If you are rude and arrogant, people will not like you.
 The golden rule is still the most important rule for getting along with others. Think of how you would like your friends to act around you. If you treat people with love and respect, they will treat you with the same.
 Gossip has a way of traveling around, and hearing that someone has been speaking ill of you behind your back is a sure-fire way to ruin a friendship. If you wouldn't say it to them in person, it is best not to say it at all.
 Be confident. Don't let it show that you're trying to be liked. Talk loud and clear, speaking slowly enough to get your words out without mumbling. You don't need to yell, interject, or rush words out -- take your time and make each word count.
 Forgiveness is not only polite, it leads to stronger friendships. No one is perfect, so judging someone for a fault is not fair when you expect them to forgive your mistakes too. Be willing to accept an apology and try and think of things through someone else's perspective -- were they really trying to be hurtful, or did they make an honest mistake?


Having the humility to give and accept forgiveness is a great way to show people that you are a reasonable, kind person.

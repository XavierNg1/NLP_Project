 In this method, you identify specifically which shares were sold. You find out the cost basis, or original cost, for each of these shares, and calculate the loss or gain accordingly. This requires the most record-keeping, but it allows for very accurate tax information., Suppose you had purchased 100 XYZ fund shares on February 12, 2014 for $5000 ($50 per share), an additional 100 shares of XYZ on March 5, 2012 for $3,000 ($30 per share), and a third 100 shares on July 7, 2005 for $1000 ($10 per share).
 Subtract the cost basis of the shares from the selling price. The difference is your taxable gain or loss. This is the amount you would report to the IRS for tax purposes.The specific share identification method allows you the freedom to select which of the shares you hold in your portfolio to sell.


To maximize your total gain, you would sell the shares purchased on July 7, 2005 for $10 per share. The cost basis of the shares would be $500 (50 x $10). The proceeds of the two sales would be $3,000. As a consequence of your selection, you would report a $2,500 capital gain.
Conversely, you could select to sell the shares purchased on February 12, 2014 for $50 per share. Your cost basis would be $2500 (50 shares x $50 per share). Since your proceeds are $3,000, your capital gain would be $500 ($3,000 - $2500).
 This method gives you more control because you can choose the most advantageous shares to sell. It also makes your tax bill more accurate, and potentially lower than the other two methods by allowing you to specify what to sell to generate the highest possible tax loss. Since you hand-select which shares to sell, you can maximize your gains and manage your income for income taxes.You can sue your tax losses to offset your capital gains or up to $3,000 in ordinary income., The process of selecting specific shares to sell and calculating the cost basis and capital gains and losses is not automated. It involves a lot of record-keeping. You need to keep track of all of your purchased assets and any adjustments to the cost, including stock splits, commissions and any other transactions. In addition, you need to keep accurate records of the sale of the assets in order to calculate the capital gains or losses.

 For the following steps in this method, we'll be trying to memorize these states and their capitals:


For rote memorization, we simply repeat and repeat what we need to memorize until it's committed to memory. This repetition makes your brain form new connections and patterns to help you produce what you're memorized - as neurologists say, "neurons that fire together wire together".;
, Memorizing through repetition encourages your brain to form the necessary connections to say or do what you've memorized.


Rote memorization is very good for manual tasks and short lists of items like a shopping list, starting a car, or ironing a shirt.
Rote memorization is not very good for memorizing a large number of separate items or single complex ideas like the elements of the periodic table from left to right, the idea of dialectical materialism, or the components of a car engine.
 Make sure your list is complete and in the sequence that you need it.
 For these states, that's simply reading off your table, over and over again, the names of the states.
 Try covering part or all of your list with a piece of paper and reciting what you've just covered over. Scroll down so that the previous table is covered - can you remember what goes in the last two blanks?

At first you'll get a lot wrong - don't get frustrated! This is just your brain getting used to the work. Keep at it and within a few minutes you'll be able to remember everything you've memorized.

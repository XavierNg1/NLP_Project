 Pick one designed to stretch the area you need, or you'll expand the boot in the wrong places.Stretchers are an excellent way to achieve significant stretching, especially when paired with shoe stretching liquid.


A two-way stretcher will stretch the foot's length and width.
A toe stretcher lifts the toe portion higher.
A vamp or instep stretcher lifts the foot portion higher.
A calf stretcher will widen the shaft of the boot. The term "boot stretcher" can also refer to this variety or to any long-handled shoe stretcher, so the packaging carefully.
If you don't know your boot size, bring it in to the shop to compare to stretchers. Stretchers apply to a range of sizes, so the fit doesn't need to be perfect.
 The boots will gain much needed flexibility if you apply shoe stretching liquid first, making adjustments easier.


If you don't want to buy a shoe stretching fluid, mix rubbing alcohol and water in equal amounts to increase your own.
Make sure the liquid you use is suitable for your boot material, then apply on the tight areas until the shoe is wet. Continue to the next step immediately.
 Use the knob to adjust it to a snug fit before placing it in the boot. If the handle is swallowed up by the ankle, you'll need to either unzip the boot or use a stretcher with a longer handle.
 Rotate the handle, usually counterclockwise, to make the wedge wider. You should feel or see the boot expanding slightly in the area the stretcher is designed to affect.


This typically takes 1-3 turns, but you should judge the amount by looking for a slight expansion and a tight feeling.
 Typically you should leave the stretcher in for 24â€“48 hours, but if you're worried the boots might become too loose, you should test them after 8 hours of waiting.


If you test the boots and they are still tight, you can put the stretchers back in immediately or first apply additional shoe stretching liquid.

Running the original motorcycle allows you to maintain registration or licensing more easily, as you are running an original manufacturerâ€™s vehicle with their registration numbers.
Ride the motorcycle, get a feel for what you like "as is" and what you want to modify.






Modify any original parts, taking advantage of the original mounting brackets and hardware.






Add or subtract parts as time and money allow, while keeping the bike in running order, to minimize down time and prolong your riding enjoyment.

, A rolling chassis includes the frame, both wheels, the front forks, handlebars and clamps that hold the bars to the forks, and customize with body work and drivetrain.


The registration numbers belong to the frame, so you can start either with a salvage project from an original manufacturer, or with an aftermarket manufacturer specializing in rolling frames.



As the wheels, front suspension and frame already work together as a unit, you know what drivetrain will fit the basic dimensions of your bike, lessening the guesswork involved.

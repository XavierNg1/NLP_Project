 If you have a picture in your phone already saved, log on to cocoppa. Once there, you should spot a button in the very top right corner that looks like a gray picture frame and a camera. Click that.;
, (We're doing icons as an example).
 You will see it after you choose.
Â Use Camera will enable you to take a picture at that moment and use it as an icon. From Gallery will transfer you to your galleries so you can pick a photo or picture.
 Crop if needed.
 (The color pink would be for a pink photo, or a Halloween category if it's a ghost or something.)

, If you choose public, after a few hours (or days) of cocoppa's system checking if it's appropriate, it will be there for the whole world to see! (If it's approved, of course!) If private, that icon will only be available to you and to you only. There may be some waiting too. And note if Cocoppa's system doesn't like your picture for some reason, it will become private.
 It may take a while, don't worry about it.

 It’s lonely road at the southern foot of Mount Chiliad and northwest of the Alamo Sea. You can get here by taking the Great Ocean Highway north from Fort Zancudo, and making a right turn towards an exit just before reaching North Chumash., As you drive along North Calafia Way, you’ll see a woman standing next to a pile of logs. Drive up near her and she’ll approach your car, asking for a lift. Your character will agree and she will get inside your car. Inside she’ll say that her name is Ursula.

Note too that you can only pick up Ursula if you’re using either Trevor or Franklin as your main character. Ursula will not show up in the location if you’re playing as Michael.
 Ursula will ask you if you could give her a ride to her house, which is in El Gordo Lighthouse found in the eastern edge of San Andreas. To get there, keep driving along North Calafia Way heading east. Count five corners and make a left turn on the fifth called Grapeseed Avenue. Keep driving to the end of the road until you see the Lighthouse on the horizon.

At the end of the road you’ll find a house. She’ll ask you to stop here and she’ll get out of your car. Unlike with Timm, there’s no time limit to getting Ursula to her home, and she won’t give you any money either, but you’ll earn 5 points on your driving skill.

, Ideally if the other person starts off, and you are ready to respond, a meaningful conversation can ensue. If you're not sure, ask the other person.

 Most dialogues (with no preformed strong opinions) would require a level of trust. If there is a lack of trust on either side, the first step would possibly be to build some trust. It can be built through the conversation itself and sometimes by being upfront and open about the level of trust. Unless you understand and put the problem on the table, the solution will not emerge.

Or record yourself through a camera having a conversation and play it back--it's amazing what you'll see and hear.
 People give you instant feedback through their body language, tone and voice.It is great feedback to work on yourselves and the conversation.

 There is one medication that veterinarians use to treat cognitive dysfunction. This medication is called deprenyl (Anipryl), and it has been shown to help with symptoms and increase brain concentration in dogs.However, it does not work with all dogs. Some dogs will see no to minimal improvement.
The medication can take a couple of weeks to work.;
, When you take your dog to the vet, you should talk with them about how to make a care plan for your dog. The vet can give you suggestions on activities and foods to give your dog to help slow the advancement of CCD.For example, your vet will give you an exercise plan for your dog and suggest toys to help with mental stimulation.
 The symptoms of canine cognitive dysfunction are similar to other conditions that may afflict senior dogs. This means you need to take your dog to the vet to get checked out. While there is no official test for CDS, your vet can rule out any other condition.Your vet may do blood tests, fluid analysis, or imaging tests. Based on test results, your dog’s age, and the symptoms, your vet may settle on a diagnosis of CCD.
 Cognitive dysfunction can have a poor prognosis. Generally, a dog’s condition will deteriorate as they continue to age. While your dog may live a happy life for awhile, there may get to be a time when the dog’s mind is not functioning enough for them to live a happy life.Talk to your veterinarian about pet hospice care or euthanasia options for when your dog’s condition gets too bad for them.

 You may even want to arrive the day before while the staff is setting up at a large concert venue. You might be able to slip in unnoticed and hide under a truck or stage. Musicians usually arrive earlier in the afternoon at smaller venues to load their gear and perform a sound check. Security is pretty low before the concert, so getting in early is often your best chance at success.
 Big music festival venues usually have large, high fences. You may need to bring in a tall ladder to even have a chance at getting over. You can try to rig up a rope ladder to draw less attention to yourself. If you do make it over without injury, be prepared to run away from security and try to lose them in a crowd.


Climbing over a high fence is not easy or safe. You could fall or get injured, which will also mean getting caught.
 Look like a roadie by carrying an empty guitar case, walkie talkies, and papers that could pass for set lists or event schedules.


Wear an ID badge. Have a forged ID ready if possible to identify you as 'crew.' Most security guards don't look closely at them and you might be able to get past. Be careful though, if caught with false credentials you could be charged with a crime.
 Many large concerts give out wristbands to ticket holders that allow them to get in and out of the venue. Save your old concert wristbands to try and find one that looks similar enough to get you inside. If you are at large outdoor venue, you can have someone inside remove their wristband, attach it to a rock or water bottle, and throw it over the fence to you.Then you can put it on and calmly stroll inside.
 Go for it. Don't turn back, don't hesitate. When there's a break, go for the doors as stealthily as possible. You're best off to wait for a distraction before trying. If you need to, make the distraction yourself. Tell the security there is a fight going on around the corner, or get a friend to ask a security guard some questions while you try to slip by him.

 In order to build an ear for any language, you have to listen to it as much as possible––Uzbek is no exception. If you conduct a simple Google or YouTube search, you will find a mosaic of Uzbek audio and video clips, media sources, and the like available for you to listen to. One excellent resource is BBC Uzbek.
 If you are aware of an Uzbek diaspora where you live or you have access to penpal websites and online chatrooms, find Uzbek speaking friends. You need to immerse yourself in Uzbek food and culture as well as have people to practice your language skills with.
 There is nothing better than learning under the proper guidance of an experienced teacher. Although finding language instruction for Uzbek may pose an incredible challenge because of its rarity outside Asia, it doesn't hurt to still look. There may be a visiting Uzbek student studying in your area who would love to do some tutoring!

 Access the control panel from the Start menu. In the "Classic" control panel view, double-click the "Display" icon in the control panel folder. In the default view, click on "Appearances and Themes" and select "Display."


Select the "Settings" tab in the upper right corner of the Display Properties dialog box. Click on the "Advanced" button in the lower right corner of the dialog box. Of the 2 options available in the "DPI Setting" pull-down menu, only the "Normal size (96 DPI)" setting can reduce your system's DPI. If your system is already set at 96 DPI, you will not be able to reduce the DPI any further.
 You must restart your computer for the desired changes to take effect. Your font sizes will appear smaller upon reboot.

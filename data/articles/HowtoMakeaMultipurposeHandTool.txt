 You can see the chuck key to the right of the drill. The key has the most important role throughout this process. Remember to save the chuck and key of any electric drill that has died before throwing it away. Keep an eye out for drills with chucks that others have tossed away too.;
, This is the right of the drill, as it is shown in the photo.
 When you get the knack, you can do it with the ball of your right hand.
, This ball is used in the handle tips of levers in gardening, farming, etc.


Check that the ball threads in properly. Hold the Hand Tool with the key inserted for an easier and safer job when securing the ball in place.

You can even attach a metal saw or a part of it. You can fit a small saw blade for little wood or plaster jobs.
Now a metal drilling bit has been attached. This comes in handy when hand drilling inside a wooden cabinet.
With an allen bit (key) you can do the first approaching turns with the screws of a piece of furniture bought in kit. Judge if you finish the tightening with a proper allen key for a stronger leverage. Good for your wrist, perhaps.



Make the holes that fit the screws, then enlarge them with this bit about 1 cm (1/2") deep.
Put the screws fixed tight in and cover the big holes with little pegs of the same wood. This finishing looks quite professional.

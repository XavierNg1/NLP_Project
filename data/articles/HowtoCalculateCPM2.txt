 Often a CPM rate is established by someone selling ad space. You can instead use this formula to determine how much your campaign will cost you for a certain number of ad views.


Total cost = (Total impressions x CPM) / 1000.
For example: 1,000,000 impressions at a rate of 50 CPM (that’s 5 dollars per 1000 impressions) would cost 50,000 dollars.
 Similarly, if you have a set rate and budget, you can determine if the potential audience is worth the money spent.


Potential Audience = (Total cost x 1000) / CPM.
For example: A 50,000 dollar advertising budget at a CPM of 10 can get up to 1,000,000 impressions.
 If you have a website and want to earn advertising revenue, CPM will be calculated by your site’s traffic and the amount of money a company is willing to spend advertising to that audience.


In web advertising this is often done automatically with a service like Google Analytics. The value of your ad space is calculated and sold to those who bid for it.
 CPM rates are useful to companies and advertisers trying to get their product to the largest audience for the most reasonable advertising cost. CPM is highly variable and can be used to compare costs across different media and spaces.


Of course, other factors such as demographic information and ad visibility will influence the overall effectiveness of an advertising campaign. CPM is best used as a baseline for cost analysis.

 Some people have a difficult time not trying to control every aspect of their life. Release your controlling grip and tell yourself that there are some things you just can't predict. While you can steer your life in a certain direction, you'll inevitably take a few wrong turns or be thrown off course by a third party. And hey, that's ok!


If life were all planned out, it'd be boring as all get out. It's the uncertainty that makes it worth living! If this is an issue for you, consciously put uncertainty in a positive light -- what little surprises will happily greet you today?

, What's done is done and what hasn't happened yet, well, hasn't happened. Don't stress yourself out by dwelling on an embarrassing moment or expecting one to happen.


There is such a thing as a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you concentrate on messing up your big speech tomorrow, you might end up messing up your big speech tomorrow. Focusing on the now grounds you in what's going on and lets you keep a level head.
 You can't avoid everything, but by practicing being in uncomfortable situations, you can grow to ease your nerves over time. If getting up on a stage in front of a crowd is something that makes you intensely nervous, try practicing on smaller stages alone before working your way up to bigger stages.


Foster a support group of family and friends that will help you meet those challenges with poise.
 This is the old "imagine the crowd in their underwear" trick, but it can actually work! Even though your boss might be extremely intimidating, tell yourself that s/he is only just another human being. S/he too probably feels nervous at times and has been in several vulnerable situations before.


The old adage, "Everybody poops" is an old adage for a reason!

, Even if you adopt several relaxation techniques into your daily routine, there will still be days when the nervousness will win. Prepare yourself for both success and failure and take each step day by day.

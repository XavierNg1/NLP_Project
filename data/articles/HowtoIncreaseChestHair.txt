Again, if you have normal levels of testosterone and you take supplements, an enzyme will convert the excess testosterone into a follicle-shrinking hormone. Not a good recipe for hair growth.

 If you have any chest hair already, shaving will help it get thicker, not help hair grow where it isn't. (This one of the reasons girls wax instead of shave.)

Tell the truth, mention your intention of growing chest hair and maybe they can let you in on their secrets. You may have nothing to worry about.
Just say that you were wondering and wanted to talk about something random.

 A "photo-printer" dedicated to printing photo-quality images will produce higher quality images than a device designed to accomplish multiple different tasks.


Avoid "all-in-one" or multipurpose printers. These printers typically do not provide the same level of quality as a device dedicated to printing photo-quality images and graphics.;
, Resolution quality may be the most important factor in determining the quality of the final product. The resolution capability of an inkjet printer will range between 4800 and 9600 dots per inch (dpi). To achieve the highest quality image quality, purchase a printer capable of printing at 9600 dpi.
 Prices for a dedicated photo-printer can range from $100 to $6000 (USD). Depending on the intended application of the final product, the most expensive option may exceed your particular needs.
 Inkjet printers offer a variety of image size options. Smaller, compact photo printers can accommodate image sizes ranging from wallet-size to letter-size. Some desktop inkjet printers can print larger sizes, ranging between 17 inches (43 cm) and 24 inches (61 cm). Commercial printers can print even larger sizes.

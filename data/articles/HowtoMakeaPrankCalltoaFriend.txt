 The ideal standard is not to be recognized by the receiver. A deeper voice is usually a good idea, but it's all relative, you are attempting to masquerade. Also, if you can do accents (British, Irish, etc.) use them to your advantage! They can make the prank really funny.;
, There is absolutely nothing more embarrassing than discovering that you have made a prank-call to someone who has absolutely no idea who you are, or who you're pretending to be.
 If you're pretending to be an admirer, don't lavish on the romantic stuff if you know that the person in question is rather shy. Also, make sure your person sounds convincing. If there's no way in the world that lets say Jade would call up Kayla and they know it, it's very likely a bad idea.
 You really don't want to waste this person's time, do you? And, minutes of your life are also disappearing while you pretend to call someone.
 You can do this by dialing *67 (in the U.S. and Canada) before the number. If done correctly, it will look like this: *67-123-456-7890

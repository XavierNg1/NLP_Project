 Using your web browser, find the website of the app you want to install, and the app download webpage (for Linux if relevant). Search for the download link that ends in '.deb'. If there are options for different computer architectures (for instance, '32-bit' and '64-bit'), make sure you choose the right one for your computer.
 Click on the download link and wait for it to fully download.
 Using your file browser, find the downloaded package file, right-click on it, and choose 'Open in Software Center'. Then you'll see the app information page. You can install it just like the previous method, but with 2 differences: you won't be able to choose any additional 'optional add-ons', and the app won't need to be downloaded before it gets installed (so it's a lot quicker to install).

 Often people who have this condition live in guilt when they eat. Eating may be pleasurable for them but they are ashamed to “admit” the need for this pleasure from food. The guilt is due to a feeling that they are doing something wrong. It is possible someone may eat a pint of ice cream and then feel a tremendous amount of guilt after eating it. This may be a sign of a food addiction.;
, This is a sign that you feel you are doing something wrong. Hiding your action can be a sign of an addiction. You may hide the fact that you are eating in a meeting or in a social gathering. You are not comfortable that others may know you are eating this food. It can be junk food or healthy food. The key to remember is that hiding implies something is wrong; you do not want others to know abut it.
 Those with a food addiction often hide food in cabinets and under the bed. It is their comfort food that they reach for often at night. This does not imply an addiction but when the habit of hiding junk food has become your needed “secret stash” it can be the sign of a food addiction.
 This is one of the lesser know signs of an eating addiction. If you find yourself lying about the amount of food you ate in a day this can be a sign of trouble. This sign indicates that you feel you are doing something wrong. You want others to feel that you are eating less than you really are and if this matters to you it is a sign of a food addiction

 Unfortunately, vanilla orchids cannot bloom until they are three years old. If yours is younger than three, it will not bloom and cannot be rushed.;

If they are dark green, that means they are getting too much sun exposure. Move the plant to a less sunny area.
If the leaves are yellow or even a brown color, this means that there is not enough sun exposure. Try moving it to a sunnier spot, such as a window ledge.
If the leaves are a light green, that means there is a perfect amount of sunlight reaching it. The incorrect amount of sunlight can inhibit the blooming.
 Vanilla orchids require fifty percent humidity in order to bloom.


If the air seems too dry, try placing the plant on a tray and fill the tray with water so that the air fills with humidity as the water evaporates. Top off the tray as often as needed, to ensure the tray has standing water in it at all times.
 Orchids require a temperature of 70 °F (21 °C) during the day but allow a ten degree drop in the evening in order to bloom properly. Set your indoor temperature controls to make sure the temperature is set just right for proper blooming of your orchid plant.
 This plays a huge role in the proper blooming of Vanilla orchids.
 Cut back on fertilization every six months when the orchid grows more slowly. Under-fertilization will result in no blooming at all or just a few small blooms.

 Organic items are made of natural materials and don’t include harsh chemicals or man-made products.


Some parents choose to use organic products on their babies because they like knowing exactly what is being put on their child and that the environment was hurt as little as possible to make the product.
 Other parents use organic materials, especially diaper cream, because it helps their baby’s sensitive skin. Organic products are free from many of irritants that can cause a baby’s skin to turn red or itchy.


A baby’s skin is very absorbent and drinks in everything that is placed on it, which makes organic diaper cream even more important.
 If you are using cloth diapers instead of disposable diapers, organic baby cream becomes even more important. If you are using cloth diapers, commercial diaper cream may not be as effective and can even ruin the diapers. Homemade organic diaper cream is safe for all kinds of diapers and all kinds of baby skin.

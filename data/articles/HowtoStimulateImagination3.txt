 Being surrounded by creative, interesting objects can help us imagine new ideas and scenarios. Create spaces in your home or office where you can display interesting souvenirs, works of art, books, maps, and curios. If you hit a creative block, you can turn to these objects for inspiration and new ideas., Studies show that people think more imaginatively and effectively when they are surrounded by natural materials. Use sunlight instead of fluorescent bulbs, and use natural wood instead of drywall if at all possible.Seek out spaces with these natural materials for your creative pursuits. If you cannot find one, consider working out-of-doors when the weather is nice: you will feel less stifled.
 Having creative, intelligent people in your social circle will help keep you inspired, invigorated, and imaginative.Maintain friendships with highly imaginative persons. You can spend time with them in purely social scenarios (such as dinner parties), or you might wish to design specific activities that are rooted in creative pursuits (such as forming a writing group).
 People are more creative when they work together in groups. By building off of one another's ideas, they are able to push their own ideas further and come up with imaginative solutions to difficult problems. However, people might also be intimidated and fearful of rejection. To keep members of a group from silencing one another, it is recommended that everyone write their ideas down and share them anonymously. The group will be more imaginative as a whole, and nobody will be too fearful to share their own thoughts.

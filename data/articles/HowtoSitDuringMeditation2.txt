 The Burmese position is considered to be the easiest of all unsupported, seated positions, and is great for beginners. To achieve this position, sit flat on the floor, and bend your knees so that your feet are both in front of you. Sit so that the heel of your left foot is touching the top of your right foot (or ankle), but don’t actually cross your legs.The Burmese position places little strain on your legs, knees, and feet.
 This is a relatively simple cross-legged pose. To get into the Quarter Lotus, cross your legs in front of you, by keeping your left foot on the floor below your right thigh, and cross your right foot over to rest on your left calf.If you struggle to achieve this pose initially, try sitting on a small pillow. This will elevate your body and make it easier to fold your legs.
 As the name suggests, the Half Lotus is similar to the Quarter Lotus pose. Move your body into a Quarter Lotus pose, but cross your right foot so that it rests on top of your left thigh (instead of your left calf).If this pose becomes difficult to hold, move back into the Quarter Lotus.
 To achieve the Full Lotus, begin by sitting in the Half Lotus position so that your right foot is resting on top of your left thigh. Then bring your left foot up over your right leg, and rest your left foot on top of your right thigh.The Full Lotus is the most symmetrical and stable meditation pose.For beginners, this pose can be uncomfortable, as you have to put both feet on top of the other leg’s thigh. Never force your body into this pose, as you can hurt your knees.
 Although this is an uncommon position, it’s fine to recline flat on your back in order to mediate.As long as you can breathe properly, you feel comfortable, and your spine is straight, feel free to practice meditation on your back.


If you find it uncomfortable to lay directly on the floor, put down a blanket.
Avoid becoming too comfortable while you’re meditating in a reclining pose. You don’t want to fall asleep.

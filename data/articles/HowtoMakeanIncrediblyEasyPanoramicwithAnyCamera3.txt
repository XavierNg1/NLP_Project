 When you copy your photos from your camera to your computer, take a look at them and choose at least four.


Make sure the photos you choose all have the same brightness and none have any blurred spots.
, Take all the photos and use the Move tool to align the images as best you can so they are more or less fit together.


Don’t worry if they’re not perfect; you will deal with that part later.
 Masking is where you try to make the visible incongruities between the photos less visible. Simply use the Soft Edge blending tool to merge them together.


Although this may take a bit more than using the Photomerge option, the end result looks very much the same.
 If you find the alignment wasn’t as straight as you wanted, you can always crop the image to your satisfaction.

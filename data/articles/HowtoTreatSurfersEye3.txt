 Since exposure to UV light is one of the great contributing factors to the development of surfer’s eye, you should substantially limit your exposure to UV.


Limit time outside when the UV index is high. Most weather websites and applications will reference the UV level outside on any given day.
Wear polarized eyeglasses or sunglasses that are rated with UV protection.
Consider wraparound sunglasses if you spend a prolonged amount of time outside., Ultimately, by limiting your time in environments that are dry and dusty, you’ll reduce the chance of another occurrence of surfer’s eye. This is because dry and dusty environments aggravate the eye and trigger the growth of pterygium.


Limit time in dry and dusty environments. For instance, if you need to work outside and you live in the Desert Southwest, limit this time to an hour a day or less.
If you have to spend time in dry and dusty environments, make sure you wear protective glasses., One of the best ways to counter the dangers of dry and dusty environments and to help prevent surfer’s eye is by making sure your eyes are properly lubricated.


Talk to your doctor about solutions that may be good for you.
Consider using artificial tears to keep your eyes lubricated.
Think about using eye drops to address irritation caused by exposure to dry or dusty environments.
Your doctor might also prescribe mitomycin eye drops to be used after surgical removal of abnormal tissue.

 Put your saucepan on low heat and melt 1T of butter or 1T oil. When warm enough to saut√©, add the chopped onion, garlic & rice. Stir very well but don't allow to brown. Keep the heat low if needs be.;
, Keep stirring until it is absorbed which could be 2 or 3 minutes. If you have hard vegetables to add such as pumpkin, add them at this stage.
 Continue to stir and add firm vegetables if you picked the capsicum or zucchini recipes.
 At this stage the goal is the vegetables should be 1/3rd cooked. You can add asparagus at this stage as it doesn't take as long to cook.
 Add the next cup when it is absorbed continue to stir, but aim not to mash or stir furiously, it's a gentle stir. Put on some music if this helps.
 If you picked the fried mushrooms or frozen peas option add them now with seasonings together.
 If it needs a little longer, turn off the heat and put the lid on for 5 minutes. The consistency should be distinct rice grains & vegetables in a creamy sauce. It shouldn't ideally be soupy, or stiff like mashed potato but in between.
 Serve with extra grated cheese if you wish.

 To prepare the 19 x 19cm panel, draw a circle around it using a compass as a guide. Leave a decent amount of edge space between this circle and the edge of the fabric.
 Pin in place then sew along the straight edge to attach it to the fabric.
 Once you reach the end of this circle, it's time to start layering the petals all the way into the center of the pillow panel.


Sew the second layer of the petals. Place the straight edge of the petal just below the straight edge of the petals already sewn on, aligning the petal so that it sits over the junction or meeting point of two petals already sewn in place (see image).
Repeat this all the way around the second circle. Keep using the large petals for now.
Continue to add more layers of petals each time you reach the end of a circle. Eventually you'll need to swap to the smaller petals, to give the impression of decreasing petal size.
 As you reach the center of the felt rose, you'll need to place fewer and fewer petals, as the space becomes tighter. Just be sure to keep aligning the petals neatly and to cover any gaps so that no fabric shows through.


At the very end, sew two petals at the heart or center of the rose.

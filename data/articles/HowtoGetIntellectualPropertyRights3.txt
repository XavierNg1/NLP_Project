 Patent examiners expect non-provisional patent applications to be written and compiled in a certain way, using a lot of arcane language that you probably don't know.


For this reason, the USPTO recommends hiring a patent attorney or registered agent to draft your non-provisional application so you can avoid wasting time and money on an application that turns out to be incomplete or incorrect., Before you go through the trouble of applying for a patent, make sure a patent will provide the intellectual property protection you need, and that your particular intellectual property isn't better protected either by copyright or trademark.


For 20 years from the date the patent application was filed, you have the right to exclude others from using, making, or selling your invention. This means if someone does any of those things without your permission, you have the right to sue them in federal court.Utility patents, which protect a process, machine, or other manufactured items, are the most common, and the patents with which people are most familiar. A new hand tool would be subject to a utility patent, as would a computer application that performed a certain process for a machine. Design or plant patents also are available.Patents protect useful objects, not the words or pictures that may appear on or within them., You can buy time to draft your non-provisional application by filing a provisional application, which allows you to take up to 12 months to file the full application while still taking advantage of the earliest filing date.Since U.S. patent law grants priority to earlier applications filed, your provisional application filing date can protect you against competitors developing similar technology.Provisional applications are cheaper to file, and don't have the same degree of complication or technical specification that non-provisional patents do.
After you file your provisional application, you can use the phrase "patent pending" to indicate that you have intellectual property rights in your invention.Your provisional application must include a written description of your invention along with the names of the inventors. The application must be accompanied by a cover sheet that provides names and contact information for the inventors, the title of the invention, and identifies any agents or attorneys who helped you prepare the application.You can file your application using the USPTO's electronic filing system, or you can mail a paper application.Filing fees for a provisional application may be as low as $65., Before you file your non-provisional application, you must conduct a complete search of "prior art" to make sure no one else has already patented an invention that is identical or similar to yours.If you find a similar invention, you must be able to differentiate your invention from the earlier one in the section of your non-provisional application covering prior art disclosures.You also must review other patents in your industry to make sure your invention is not obvious. The USPTO won't approve patents for technology that would have been obvious to other inventors in the same field.A patent attorney or other agent licensed to practice before the USPTO can help you conduct a thorough search of prior art and ensure your invention is patentable before you spend the time and effort drafting your non-provisional application., Your complete application will contain a number of forms that must be included when you file. You can download these forms from the USPTO's website.You must complete forms including application transmittal and fee transmittal forms, an application data sheet, specification forms, and an oath or declaration page.The specification forms constitute the bulk of your application, and include detailed drawings and descriptions regarding your invention and how it is made or used. In addition, you'll provide a background and summary of your invention, the claims you're making in the invention, and disclosures of prior art., Once you've completed your application, you must file it with the USPTO to begin the process of getting intellectual property rights in your invention.


If you're planning to file electronically, you must first determine your processing fees and apply for a customer number and a digital certificate.Your processing fees will vary depending on the number of claims you have, and the total amount may be reduced if you qualify as a small or micro entity. Individuals or companies with fewer than 500 employees are generally classified as small entities. Small entities that have filed fewer than four non-provisional utility patents and have income below a certain level qualify as micro entities and pay even lower fees.After you've filed your application, you can use the calculator provided on the USPTO website to estimate how long it will take before a patent examiner takes action on your application., Your patent examiner will review your application and reject claims. Although you may argue the patentability of those claims with the examiner, you may not revise your application after the examination process has begun.Keep in mind that it could take years for you to hear back from a patent examiner regarding your application, depending on the type and complexity of your invention.After you receive the first action from the patent examiner explaining which claims are lacking, you have a maximum of six months to file a response and argue the patentability of your claims.If the examiner twice rejects any claims, he or she can make the rejection final. At this point, you have the ability to revise your application and cancel or amend claims to accommodate the examiner's concerns on rejection.Provided you overcome the examiner's objections, your patent will be issued as soon as you pay the required issue and publication fees., Once your patent is granted, you must pay periodic maintenance fees to keep your protection active.These fees are due 3.5, 7.5, and 11.5 years after the date your patent is granted. the amount of fees varies each year, and is reduced for small and micro entities.

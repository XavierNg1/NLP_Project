 When you lose fat, you don't necessarily lose muscle — and muscle weighs more than fat. So consider that number on the scale arbitrary — it's much more about how you look and feel.


That said, checking in on the scale at least once a week does seem to benefit long-term weight loss plans. So, don’t throw away your scale, but do find the frequency that works for you., People under excess stress tend to make less healthy food choices, and they may also burn fat more slowly. Excessive stress is bad for your skin, it's bad for your sleep, it's bad for relationships — it's just bad overall. So find a healthy way to get rid of it! You’ll feel better no matter how much it helps you in losing body fat.Many people find success in reducing stress through meditation and yoga. But maybe long walks in the park or listening to relaxing music will do the trick for you. Keep trying until you find what works.
 While everyone’s needs vary, plan to aim for around 7-9 hours a night. You may think that sleep would be counterproductive in losing fat, but properly rested bodies tend to process carbs more efficiently.Also, if you're not properly rested, you start craving sugar. Your hormone levels (cortisol, ghrelin, and insulin) go of out of whack and your body starts clinging onto fats and sugars left and right. Prevent this by getting the sleep you need.
 Even the slightest amount of activity is better than none at all. Studies show that fidgeters, on average, weigh less. Non-fidgeters are even more likely to store calories as fat. So in addition to cleaning the house, walking the dog, and parking on the far side of the parking lot, find time to fidget, if that’s your kind of thing!Little opportunities can always be had. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Go around the grocery store in the most inefficient way possible. Fake out your chair by not quite sitting down — that is, by doing squats. This stuff adds up without you even realizing it.

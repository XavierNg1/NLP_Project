 Beer mugs are common in Indonesia but they serve as tea mugs. Teas are often over-watered and flavorless so they need to drink a lot of it, but thatâ€™s another story. Add sugar to the kopi tobruk if you wish.;
, Do not allow it to go into a roiling boil as this will cause the water, as subsequently your coffee, to taste flat. Pour enough water to fill your mug to about a centimeter from the brim.
, This will give the coffee grounds time to settle to the bottom.
 Discard the dregs afterwards, but not into the sink as this will eventually clog your sink's P-trap.

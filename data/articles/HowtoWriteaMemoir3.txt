 Has it said what you ventured out to say? Is anything left out? Are questions raised and not answered? Is your wording clear? Does it move you?


A good memoir is entertaining. It doesn't necessarily have to be funny, but it should be deliberately something. What is the reader getting from it? Why would they drop their own worries and start caring about yours?
In addition to checking for content errors, check for grammar, spelling, and punctuation mistakes. Your computer will not catch everything. If you have a close friend or family member that is particularly good at this, ask them for assistance.
 Not everything you write will be gold. After you've taken a break, start back at the beginning, dissecting and removing. Weed out what's unnecessary and repetitive.


Not every instance of your existence is worth noting. If an event isn't part of a flowing transition into another, it doesn't have to make it to the page. Include only what gets you to your end point without meandering from your path.
 After you have revised as much as you can, give your memoir to some trusted friends for feedback. You may see a pattern in their comments, and that's a good indication of what needs further revision. Don't be shy and seek a professional editor if needed.


If they're in it (or not in it), be careful. Don't hurt anyone's feelings by putting them in a negative light (or not putting them in one at all) and then forcing them to read it. You'll only get a negative reaction.
Constructive criticism is vital to your work. Sometimes you may not see things that others will point out, and it may help you improve your work.

 Your device, whether it’s an iPod, laptop, or smartphone, has an audio input that your headphone jack should fit into perfectly. An mp3 player only has one input, which takes any guesswork out of the equation. For a laptop or larger device, you may need to check around the perimeter and on the back to find the right audio input.


The headphone jack should pop into the input without having to be forced. If yours won’t fit, the headphones may be incompatible with the device.
If you have wireless headphones, use your device’s Bluetooth connection to link the headphones to it.;
, Many headphones specify which ear cup goes over the left ear and which one goes over the right. Check around your ear cups for the “L” and “R” markings, which mean "Left" and "Right."If you find these markings, follow the instructions for distinguishing which ear cups goes over which ear.
If you don’t find these markings, you can wear the cups over either ear.
 The band that connects the cups should fit snugly over the top of your head. Most headphone bands are adjustable, so if the fit isn’t comfortable, try adjusting it. Tug at the band to see if it gets smaller or larger, then adjust as needed.
 Adjust them a bit so that the cups cover your ears comfortably.Over-ear headphones, which have large cushions as ear cups, create a slight seal effect over each ear, which cancels out noise during use. On-ear headphones are smaller, and the cups are usually around the size of your ear. They will fit directly over the ear hole.You may need to remove your earrings if you find that the cups push into the jewelry uncomfortably.

 During the consultation with your stylist before your perm, tell him or her exactly what you expect from the process. Outline how you usually style your hair, how big you want the curls to be, and which products you tend to use.


Know that a perm that results in larger, looser curls is sometimes referred to as a body wave. If this is what you want, use that term to communicate it to your stylist.
 If you think you'll get bored, grab a few magazines from the reception area, or bring a paperback book that you won't mind losing if it gets chemicals dripped onto it.
 The chemicals used to perm hair can smell noxious, and might irritate your nose. If this begins to happen, request a damp washcloth and hold it over your nose and mouth, breathing through it.


If the chemicals start irritating your eyes, keep them closed. It won't last forever.
 Keep in mind that your curls will be a little tighter immediately after the perm than they will be in a few days. If you're unhappy with any aspect of the style, tell your stylist your concerns before you leave the salon. He or she can make plans to address any lapses as soon as possible.

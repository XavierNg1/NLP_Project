 Insecurity during April is very common for autistic people, so the autistic community often holds events to help everyone stay positive. Look for...


Flashblogs
Give aways
Memes and hashtags like #RedInstead (formerly #WalkInRed)
Art events
Outreach opportunities to educate others, Enjoy a fun outing, catch up with each other, or just sit and watch movies about things you love together.


If all your autistic friends are online, that's okay. Message them and catch up with each other.
If you have no autistic friends, look for disability or autism clubs and support groups in person, and the hashtags #askanautistic and #actuallyautistic, where you can join conversations.
 Appreciate your autistic strengths, which may include focus, special interests, pattern recognition, passion, and creativity. Try making a list of your talents (autism-related and otherwise).
 Balance out the dehumanization of autism with media that celebrates and reassures autistic people.


Look at autistic art, especially pictures of people stimming.
Read autism positivity blogs.
Look through WikiHow's autism category and the illustrations of happy autistic people.
Read other people's autistic headcanons.
Create your own material.
 Wear shirts with neurodiversity messages, stim in public, and wear red for #RedInstead.This can affirm your self worth and send out positive messages to the public. Make your goal this April to care less about what other people think of you.


If you don't feel comfortable outing yourself, you can always say that it's for an autistic person you love (i.e., you).

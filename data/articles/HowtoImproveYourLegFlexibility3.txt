 Stand facing a wall with your arms extended and hands held flat against the wall. Your legs should be shoulder distance apart, with one leg extended behind you and feet flat on the floor. Bend your forward knee and lean toward the wall while keeping your back straight, feeling the stretch work through the calves and hamstrings of your back, extended knee.Hold this pose for 30 seconds to a minute, and repeat on the other leg. Proceed with 5 to 10 repetitions for each leg.
 Get on all fours with your hands under your shoulders with your knees bent under your hips and held apart at shoulder distance. Spread your fingers apart for wide support and walk your hands slightly forward. Bring your hips up toward the ceiling as you tighten your core muscles.Try to keep your heels close to or on the ground, and feel the stretch work through your calves as you keep your knees straight.
Hold the pose for thirty seconds to a minute, or longer if youâ€™re able to do so. Proceed with 5 to 10 repetitions.
Try bending one knee at a time while keeping your toes in place to extend the stretch through your hamstrings.
 Start by laying on your back with your buttocks facing a wall. Tuck yourself as close to the wall as you can, and bring your legs straight up against the wall. Keep them as straight as possible, so your torso on the floor and your legs against the wall form a 90 degree angle. Flex your feet by stretching your toes toward your torso, and feel the stretch work through the backs of your legs.Try to hold the pose for 2 to 3 minutes.
If you have an elastic strap, try looping it over your feet and hold each end in your hands to increase the stretch.

 To send the signal you just want to be friends, keep the guy in question in your friends group. Avoid solo hang outs. When inviting him out, make it clear a whole group is coming and not just the two of you.For example, invite him to a movie night with a group of friends.
You can also redirect him if he asks you to go somewhere with him. For example, say he asks you to go to a party with him. Say something like, "Oh, I'm going with a whole group of my friends. You're totally welcome to join."

, Many people are casually touchy with their friends. You may hug friends hello or goodbye or casually pat friends on the shoulder during conversation. If you think a guy likes you, refrain from engaging in these rituals with him. This can easily send the wrong message., It's normal to compliment your friends. However, you don't want to go overboard complimenting a guy you think likes you. This may make him think you're interested when you're not.For example, say he's wearing a shirt you like. Saying something like, "You look nice today" could come off as flirtatious.
Instead, find a less flirty comment. Say something like, "Nice shirt!" You could also forego commenting altogether, just to be safe.
 If the guy starts flirting with you, try your best to ignore it. Responding to flirtation could be read the wrong way. If the guy, say, grins at you from across the room, return his gaze with a curt nod rather than smiling back.


If a guy is persistently flirting with you in ways that make you feel uncomfortable, say something. For example, "I really don't like you touching me all the time."

 Landlords and other business owners should follow their legal duties of ensuring all water systems on their premises are properly maintained and operated.Depending upon what state you are in, there are specific regulations and requirements you need to comply with in order to legally operate your business.
Working with a water treatment company may be necessary if you do not have the skills, knowledge or competence to perform your legal health and safety duties.
 Businesses should test pH levels at least twice a day, more when the hot tub is crowded. Chlorine should be at 2 – 4 ppm (parts per million), bromine should be at 4 – 6 ppm, and pH at 7.2 – 7.8 ppm. You should also change the water regularly, replace the filter as recommended by the manufacturer, and remove slime and other biofilm with daily cleanings., You should have a professional risk assessment performed at least once every two years. You should also consider an assessment after changes to the water system, the building has changed used, or any cases of Legionnaire’s disease have been reported by customers.Water sampling should be done by an accredited laboratory or by the proper authority. Use your state-recommended provider to make sure you receive accurate results.
Note that all systems house some Legionella bacteria. The issue is how much and whether the bacteria is being distributed from the water system to customers.

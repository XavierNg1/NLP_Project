 Generally, you need to burn more calories through regular activity and exercise than what you take in through food to lose weight.One way to eat less is to use smaller plates.
Another way to track how many calories you're eating, and thus, reduce them is to keep a food diary. Just write down everything you eat in a day, including portion sizes, then calculate your calories using an online calorie counter. You can also find apps for your phone that will help you count calories.
 In place of chips at lunch, choose the broccoli instead. When you're going through the drive-thru, opt for a side salad instead of the fries. At dinner, eat spinach instead of a bowl of rice. By making a few simple switches, you'll lower your calorie intake while still eating enough to feel full. In addition, the extra fiber will help you feel fuller.Remember when you're grabbing a salad that not all salads are healthy. Some have fatty cheeses or dressings that add extra calories. Look for salads that are mostly vegetables and fruits with low-fat dressings, though be sure to add some protein if it is your main meal., Protein takes a while to digest, which means you stay filled up for longer. Eat a protein-rich breakfast, such as a couple of boiled eggs paired with fruit, to stay fuller all day., Sugar can quickly add up when it comes to calories, especially if you're drinking it in juice or soda. Also, the American Heart Association recommends that women only eat about 6 teaspoons of added sugar per day. Sugars in fruits and vegetables are fine, but try to cut out refined sugar where you can.Always look at food labels. Foods can have added sugars without you even realizing it, such as breads, dressings, and condiments. Don't forget that sugar can be under other names, such as "high fructose corn syrup," "molasses," and "sucrose."Add other flavors to replace the sugar. For instance, you could add cinnamon to your coffee instead of sugar or sweetener.

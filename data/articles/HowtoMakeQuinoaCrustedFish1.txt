 First, line a large baking sheet with some parchment paper. Then give the paper a light spray of cooking spray and set it aside. Next, set the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius) if you’re making your fish to serve immediately, as opposed to prepping a meal to serve later on in the week., While the oven continues to preheat, coat the bottom of a large skillet with a light layer of vegetable oil. Turn the burner to medium-high heat. Once the skillet heats up, add the quinoa. Stir periodically for three to four minutes, or until the quinoa begins to toast., Give it about ten minutes to cool off, since steam from hot foods can upset the lid to your food processor while you’re using it. Once it’s cooled down, add it to the processor. Pulse for about 20 seconds.

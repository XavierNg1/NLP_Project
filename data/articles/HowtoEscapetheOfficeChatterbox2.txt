 By keeping piles of papers stacked on your desk, multiple spreadsheets and emails open on your computer, and a mile-long to-do list clearly visible in your workspace, you can create a aura of busyness that might help discourage would-be interruptions.


Continue working and do not make eye contact. Keeping your eyes fixed on your computer monitor, continue to read, open mail, or type when the chatterbox approaches your desk. She may notice that you are busy working and quietly walk away.
 In modern offices that may no longer have doors or even cubical walls to give workers any sense of privacy, headphones may be the only remaining way to create any sense of solitude in the office. The chatterbox will not know whether you have the headphones turned on or off, and this may discourage visits and conversation.


If you choose to turn the headphones on, listening to relaxing music may help you better concentrate in a noisy office as well as escape the unwanted exchange.
If the chatterbox doesn’t take the hint and talks to you anyway, take off the headphones and act surprised at the interruption, as if you were actively listening to something important., The gesture should communicate that you have to somewhere important to be, or that you are acutely aware of the time. It may also help to set an alarm on your watch or phone at a time that the chatterbox usually interrupts you, such as right before lunch.


If the person still doesn’t take the hint, you can say “I’m sorry, but I’m running late for an appointment.” or “Oh is it already 2:30? I need to catch up on some work.”, If nothing else seems to be working, try standing up at your workstation, so that the person interrupting you is suddenly at eye level rather than standing above you. This sudden switch may make the person uncomfortable, and will send a signal to them that the conversation is over.

 To make your nose appear thinner with makeup, you'll need the proper makeup brushes. You'll need your foundation brush, a small, angled brush to contour and shape your nose, as well as a fluffy blending brush or beauty blender to soften lines. Using the proper brushes will help your makeup to look natural and well-blended., To highlight your nose, use a luminous concealer that is 1-2 shades lighter than your natural skin tone or foundation. If you want to add a shimmery highlighter to your nose, do it after you've applied all of your other makeup. Sometimes shimmery highlighters can draw unwanted attention to your nose, so use them lightly or not at all., To make your nose appear smaller, you'll need to use darker shades of makeup to create shadows. These shadows will make your nose appear thinner, and will look natural once blended. Choose a powder, eyeshadow, or foundation that is about 2 shades darker than your skin tone.
 If you're unsure of the types of highlighters and darker contouring makeup to buy, invest a little more money to get a contouring kit. Contouring kits are used by both beginners and professionals, and they make sculpting your nose with makeup much easier. Contouring kits can be purchased at professional makeup stores or at local convenience stores.

, The paper can be white, black, or any other color, depending on what color you want your iPhone to be. Carefully fold the paper over the styrofoam block to completely cover it in paper. Glue or tape the paper to hold it in place.
 Use silver sharpie or colored pencil on black paper to make it stand out. On lighter colors, draw the logo and camera on in black. Add details to them so they look realistic.
 Make sure to add the camera, the outline of the screen, and the home button. Again, add details like the little square on the home button to make them look realistic. Use pictures of real iPhones as references so that you know what to draw.
 Use wide tape like boxing tape so that it fits the screen. This gives your screen a glossy look, but it will also become an important part of protecting the paper phone when we get to changing screens later.
 Draw a detailed representation of the iPhone lock screen on it. Print a picture to be the background image, or use plain paper and colour it so it looks real. Add details like the amount of battery left,

, The reason why you are not drawing your lock screen on your iPhone is so that it looks like it actually works when you change screens, instead of just having one screen.
 Draw a detailed home screen on it. Include any apps or other details you want, and color it in so it looks realistic. Again, stick a piece of tape on the paper to allow for easy sticking and un-sticking.
 This will allow you to stick and unstick it easily, so that you can swap out which screen is on your iPhone.
 The more screens you have, the more realistic your iPhone will be and the more it will be able to do. Swapping them in and out often will make it feel like your iPhone is actually working.

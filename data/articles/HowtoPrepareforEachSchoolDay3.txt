 Make a list of things you will need to do in the morning and any after school activities. Allocate time to each task. Many people allow themselves an hour to get ready, while others only take about fifteen minutes to get themselves ready for the day. On a weekend or an extended vacation, practice your morning routine and see how long you will need for each lesson. You do not need to plan out every aspect of your after school activities, but make some things certain, such as your study time, a bedtime, and a dinner time. A good after-school schedule might look something like this for the average middle schooler:


Come home-3:00
Do homework-3:30
Go to basketball practice-5:00
Come home and eat dinner-6:30
Study-7:00
Shower-8:30
Watch TV-9:00
Go to bed-10:00.
 It should be somewhere away from the TV and other distracting noises. Be sure to have plenty of materials and supplies needed, such as paper, pencils, etc. Have a snack available during study.
 Be sure to empty backpacks of unneeded items.

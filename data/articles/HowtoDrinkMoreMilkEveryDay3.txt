 Some people who have a hard time digesting lactose (found in dairy products) find that combining milk with food makes it easier to digest., These over-the-counter pills can be taken right before meals to help your body digest milk and dairy products., Some dairies and milk producers add lactase directly to milk, so you can get the taste and nutritional value of milk without the risk of digestive problems.Unsweetened almond milk, coconut milk and rice milk are all great alternatives.
 If drinking milk is not an option, opt for other milk products, like yogurt or cheese. Even though these foods are still made with milk, they may be easier to digest.

 These two methods are currently the only supported way of adding friends to your clan. You cannot look up people by their Clash of Clans name, and that feature is likely never coming..


Supercell (the Clash of Clans developer) is currently looking into adding support for Google+ friends through Google Play Games, but this feature is not yet available.;
, This will allow you to find your Facebook friends that also have Clash of Clans connected to their own accounts.


Open Clash of Clans and tap the Trophy button.
Tap the Friends tab and then tap "Connect to Facebook."
Confirm that you want to connect accounts in the Facebook app or website that opens. You will need to log into Facebook if you aren't already.
 If you are using an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, you can find your GameCenter friends in Clash of Clans. You can add people to your GameCenter friends list as long as you know their GameCenter nickname or email address.


Open the GameCenter app on your iOS device.
Tap the "Friends" tab at the bottom of the screen.
Tap the "+" button in the upper-right corner.
Search for your friends using their GameCenter nickname or Apple ID email address.
 After you've connected your Facebook and GameCenter accounts, you can invite your friends from those services to your clan.


Tap the Trophy button in Clash of Clans and then tap the "Friends" tab.
Tap the friend you want to invite. You'll only see people listed who have also connected Clash of Clans to either Facebook or GameCenter.
Tap "Invite" to send a clan invite. This option will only appear if that person is not already in a clan.
 You can find other users by searching by their clan tag, if you know it. Note that you won't be able to invite them to your clan because they are already in one.


Tap the "i" button at the top of the screen.
Tap the "Join Clan" tab.
Type in the clan tag with a "#" before it. For example: "#P8URPQLV."

 While stains are one thing, taking time to care for your carpet as a whole will ensure it gets its best possible longevity. Getting your carpet cleaned every 12-18 months is optimal. You can either hire a professional cleaning company or buy a carpet cleaning machine. It's generally recommended you hire a pro if you can afford the expense. A professional job will ensure the carpet is as clean a it can be, and minimizes the risk of complications. , The best way to solve a stain is to prevent it outright. Unlike a carpet, a mat can be easily thrown into the laundry or cleaned by hand. Placing mats in areas with a high risk for stains and you may well save yourself time and stress in the future.


The front door to your home is a choice area to place a mat; not only is it one of the most highly-trafficked areas in your home, it'll also come with the threat of dirt and mud trailed in from the outside.
Placing mats beside kitchen and bathroom sinks is a good way to trap water. The same goes beside baths and showers, as anyone using the shower will track water and suds with them when they get out.
 If you have carpets, vacuuming is an absolute must. Dust and dirt can get trailed in and make your carpet feel gritty pretty fast. Vacuuming every day or two will ensure your carpet's always looking and feeling its best. If you don't have the time to vacuum regularly, investing in a robotic automatic vacuum is relatively inexpensive and a great way to keep your carpets clean without having to invest a great deal of time into it.
 Left for more than 24 hours, wet or damp carpet will encourage mildew and bacterial growth. Needless to say, this isn't the sort of thing you want in your home. A dehumidifier will help suck up excess moisture if your home has a tendency for such.
 Stains become much more permanent the longer they're left unattended. If you solve them as soon as they first happen, you'll be saved a lot of trouble in the future.

 To get an initial sense of each student’s background and interests, pass around a questionnaire for them to fill out at the start of the year. At the top of the form, have students write their full name and classroom number. Include questions that require more detail than a simple yes or no, such as:”What is your favorite subject at school?”
”What is your favorite hobby?”
”How many siblings do you have?”
”Who do you most admire?”
”What career do you hope to have?”

, Use course work to get to know students better by assigning projects that reveal more about each student’s unique persona. If you are teaching an English class, for example, assign a project where students write about their favorite book of all time, and what it means to them. Having students present these projects to the class is also a way to help students get to know one another beyond their basic interactions., Keep detailed accounts of students’ progress to get a better sense of what they are like individually. Note the students who are falling behind (e.g. not turning in assignments or participating in classroom activities) and approach them about their work habits to find out if any particular obstacles are standing in their way. Take note of students who may be struggling with course material, as well as those who are excelling and may need extra challenges.

 You will use just the front "cover" of the card for this project.
 Mark where you will score and fold it. One fold will create a short tab about 1/2" (1cm) long and the other fold will divide the remaining section into two equal parts.

You can put the short tab either on the top or the bottom, so take a look at the design on the card and decide how you'd like it to line up on the finished pouch.
 You can use a nail or an empty ball-point pen to do this.
 The short end will create a tab. Fold the tab towards the inside.
 Align the object so its edge is tangent to the edge of the card and so that the arc is centered. Do this to both ends of the folded tube.
 Score on both sides. Do not draw or cut these curves. Line the round object up so that it just meets each corner of the tube.
Cut all the layers of the card along the curves you just traced.,,,,, Your recipient only needs to unfold one end of the pouch to retrieve the gift.

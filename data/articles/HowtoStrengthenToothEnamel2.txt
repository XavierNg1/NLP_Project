 Tooth bonding might be necessary if your teeth are very rough and discolored. This procedure will smooth and whiten the teeth. This helps them blend in with the teeth around them. Tooth bonding is easier and less costly than getting either a veneer or a crown on your tooth to repair it. , Applying veneers are another option for rough and discolored teeth. A dentist will create a custom-made shell, or veneer, to cover the front of your tooth. The veneer is then bonded to the tooth itself, creating a smooth white surface to repair the affected tooth. , Fitting a crown might be necessary to cover and seal the entire tooth to save it if you are suffering from extreme enamel loss. Crowns, like veneers, are custom-made for the patient's tooth. The crown will cover the exposed dentin to prevent infection and act as the enamel did, smoothly protecting the tooth.

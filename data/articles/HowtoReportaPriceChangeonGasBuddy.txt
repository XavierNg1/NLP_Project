, There you'll find all the state's pages for a more-localized view.
,, You'll see a big box of a lot of options that is labeled "Report Gas Prices".
 The first line of options will ask you to provide what types of gas types you'll be reporting. Click the checkbox to the left of the item's type to enable another (at first) hidden box. Type the price in (omitting the 9/1000 gas tax number).


Be sure to add the period in between the dollar and cent amount. It's an awful difference for the system to compare when a price of 3.59 a gallon turns to be 359.00 a gallon (or so the system believes).
 You'll be furnishing the station ("Station (other)"), the area (Area (other)" and/or station address. Click the corresponding drop-down box underneath the label. If the item isn't listed, click the "(other)" link, and the drop-down box will turn into a text-box for you to type into.


Do a complete search on the station type. Many times people tend to look for one version of the item and when that's not found, they tend to look for the other, and when both have been exhausted, tend to type it in another way, to make sure. If it's still not found, you'll have to request a new gas station be entered at the address.
 While the comments button is rarely used by many people, the "Time spotted button is crucial, in telling people when this price was spotted and entered" and can be beneficial if a price change is soon to be on the way".

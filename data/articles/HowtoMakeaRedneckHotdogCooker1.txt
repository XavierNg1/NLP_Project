 The idea is to stick the hotdog on the end of something like a rake so look for either a garden rake, garden claw or any other tool that will allow you to make the transformation.

Consider something with a long pole. You don’t want your tender fingers near the flame, so make sure you choose something that gives you enough distance between the hotdogs, fire and your hands.



 


Make sure the item can be near a flame. Anything made of plastic or rubber will melt and product noxious fumes once heated. Only use old fashioned steel or metal for cooking.

, If you want to approach the job using traditional cooking utensils, consider creating your own cooking device using a variety of tools or items from the kitchen and garage.

Join a skillet to a shovel. Use wire to bond the skillet to the shovel and you’ve created a long handled skillet that allows you to sit by the fire with beer in one hand, skillet in the other.






Transform a stand-alone sprinkler into a shish kabab hot dog cooker. Stick metal rods or even wooden sticks in old sprinkler heads, position next to the fire and allow the dogs to cook on their own. Remember to turn and rotate for even cooking.
 While it may take a few minutes, cleaning the garden rake or any other tool you find in the garage will help you maintain sanitary cooking conditions. And help you to avoid anyone becoming sick.


Use dish soap and hot water to clean tools. Give the tools a good scrubbing with a lot of soap and water, then rinse and allow to dry before using tool as a cooking device.

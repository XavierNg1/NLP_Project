 Not every sequence begins with the numbers 0 or 1. Look at the list of numbers that you have and find the first term. This is your starting point, which can be designated using variables as a(1).

It is common in working with arithmetic sequences to use the variable a(1) to designate the first term of a sequence. You may, of course, choose any variable you like, and the results should be the same.

For example, given the sequence 3,8,13,18{\displaystyle 3,8,13,18}…, the first term is 3{\displaystyle 3}, which can be designated algebraically as a(1).
 In this working example, the common difference is 8−3{\displaystyle 8-3}, which is 5. Checking with other terms in the sequence provides the same result. We will note this common difference with the algebraic variable d.
 An explicit formula is an algebraic equation that you can use to find any term of an arithmetic sequence, without having to write out the full list. The explicit formula for an algebraic sequence is a(n)=a(1)+(n−1)d{\displaystyle a(n)=a(1)+(n-1)d}.

The term a(n) can be read as “the nth term of a,” where n represents which number in the list you want to find and a(n) is the actual value of that number. For example, if you are asked to find the 100th item in an arithmetic sequence, then n will be 100. Note that n is 100, in this example, but a(n) will be the value of the 100th term, not the number 100 itself.
 Using the explicit formula for your sequence, fill in the information that you know to find the term that you need. 

For example, in the working example 3,8,13,18{\displaystyle 3,8,13,18}…, we know that a(1) is the first term 3, and the common difference d is 5. Suppose you are asked to find the 100th term in that sequence. Then n=100, and (n-1)=99. The complete explicit formula, with the data filled in, is then a(100)=3+(99)(5){\displaystyle a(100)=3+(99)(5)}. This simplifies to 498, which is the 100th term of that sequence.

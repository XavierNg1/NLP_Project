 Locate the app icon on your Android device home screen or app drawer. The app icon has the Twitter logo on it.
 Tap the icon with three vertical dots on the header menu bar to show a submenu. Tap “Settings” from here, and the Settings screen will appear.
 The General settings screen will appear.
 Tap the checkbox for “Image previews” to leave it blank. This will disable Image Previews for the tweets.
 Tap the back button on the leftmost part of the header to save your changes and go back to your main wall. When you check tweets, you will no longer see any photo or video with them. If you want to see them, you have to tap on the links so that they can be opened for viewing.

 Share the bathing, hair combing, tooth brushing, dressing, and other grooming routines with your daughter.


Showing her how to care for herself and establishing a routine during which she can count on your personal attention teaches her from a young age that you are there to take care of her.
 Imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and it also indicates that your daughter is trying to learn her cues for behavior from you. If your daughter tries to mimic your body language, activities, or routines, invite her to participate and to learn from you. However, keep in mind that she is an individual. Encourage her to participate in activities with you, but let her explore her own interests.


Set good examples. If you have negative feelings toward your looks or body shape, you risk passing on these same issues to your daughter. Learn to embrace your size and your imperfections and teach her to love herself regardless of the often unrealistic media images presented on the "perfect body".
Always talk to your daughter openly about body image issues. Be honest about your own feelings and avoid being judgmental of how she looks. If you find it hard to talk about, there are excellent resources available in books and online for helping you approach body image and related issues with your daughter.
 If you love to jog, bring your daughter with you in a jogging stroller; if you love to shop, people-watch, garden, cook, or read, find ways to bring your daughter with you or help her to be a part of the action at your side.


Involve your daughter in chores early on, as a way to develop personal responsibility rather than enforcing an "expected role." If you have sons, include them as well, doing the same amount of chores, so that your daughter and sons learn that chores are the shared responsibility of all householder, to ensure the smooth running of a household.

 If you are at the gym, you can do this exercise on a bench (this exercise is also known as a "bench dip." If you are home, a chair with a back that is at about hip-height will do. Sit on the edge of the seat, with your hands placed on either side of you on the edge of the chair. Your feet should be planted flat on the ground. , Gripping the seat of the chair with your hands at either side of your hips, slide your butt off the chair seat so that you are supporting your weight with your hands. Keep your feet flat on the floor., Bend your elbows as you slowly lower your body in front of the chair. You only need to lower a few inches. Keep your torso upright or leaning back slightly to keep your shoulders aligned above your wrists. Your feet and thighs should remain flat, and your arms need to be firmly gripping the chair. Pause for two seconds at the bottom, then slowly straighten your arms to lift your body back to the starting position.
 Start with sets of about 10 or 15 reps, resting for at least 40 seconds in between each set. If you are having difficulty doing this many reps, you can start with eight to 12 reps. Work your way up to higher reps per set.

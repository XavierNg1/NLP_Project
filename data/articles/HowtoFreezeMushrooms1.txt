 While steaming may preserve more flavor in frozen mushrooms, blanching or parboiling will still keep the mushrooms fairly high quality for up to 12 months, although experts disagree on the effects of exposing mushrooms to water.This method requires no equipment other than a pot of water and a heat source, and the mushrooms will stay tasty for up to a year in the freezer afterwards.


This method is especially useful if you intend to use the frozen mushrooms for soup, since the slightly soggier texture will go unnoticed.;
, You'll need enough water to cover the mushrooms, plus a little extra because some will boil away. If you'd like to preserve the mushrooms' color, you can add a teaspoon (5 mL) of lemon juice for each quart (L) of water., While your water is heating, you may chop your mushrooms in quarters or slices. Do this if the recipes you plan on using call for chopped or sliced mushrooms.


While you may wash the mushrooms under running water to remove stuck-on dirt, the boiling water should clean the mushrooms during cooking., Because the mushrooms are room temperature, the water will probably stop boiling when you add them. Wait until the water boils again, then turn off the heat after 1 or 2 minutes of boiling. Do not fully cook the mushrooms, as this may make them soggy.
 Prevent the heat from overcooking the mushrooms by placing them in a container of cold water. Wait until they are cool to the touch.
 The containers should be freezer safe, sealed, and have a small amount of air inside them in case the mushrooms expand during freezing. The mushrooms should retain their quality for up to 12 months.Add the frozen mushrooms directly to the dish you are cooking. If making mushroom soup, add 20 minutes before the soup is ready.

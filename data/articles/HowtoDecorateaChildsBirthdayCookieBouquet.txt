 Try finding cartoons, shows, books, or hobbies best.


Some examples of favorite cartoons could be Blue's Clues, Dora the Explorer, Peppa Pig, Max and Ruby, Go Diego Go, or Little Bill.;
, A good color theme makes your bouquet the best! Girls may like yellow, pink, or red while boys may like blue, green, or black. It really depends on your child's likes.
 Imagine what your bouquet will look like and draw it out. Use coloring pencils to color it in so you can understand what colors will be used. Sketching may also help bring theme ideas or anything else particular.
 It should have plenty of space, be decorative, clean, and easy to carry around.
 Rip a large piece and crumble it up neatly. Place it in your bouquet. You may need to crumble more if needed.
 Try to have them standing up so they can be seen better.
 This can be very fun for kids and great birthday treats. Cheap plastic toys can be found at the Dollar Tree, and so can stickers.
 Examples could be adding little 'Happy Birthday' post-its around your bouquet, threading ribbon around the basket handle, throwing in glitter, or adding more mini toys.
 Watch them be amazed as they see their beautiful birthday gift!

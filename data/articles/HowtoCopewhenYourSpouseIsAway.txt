 It's okay to cry if you know your partner is leaving. Just remember that their departure is not the end of the world, and be sure not to procrastinate. The farewell may seem ages off, but give yourself plenty of time to prepare.;
, Treat them to a meal at their favorite restaurant, take them to the cinema to see the movie they've been dying to watch. Enjoy your time together and make them realize how much "they'll" miss "you"!

, However, don't make them feel guilty for leaving. If they think you're upset with them, they'll worry about you and won't be able to enjoy their trip.
 Have a movie marathon, read web-comics, settle in with a good book. Don't let your mind linger on their departure.
 But remember that they're busy, either getting their work done or trying to relax. Constant interruption might prolong their stay. Call or text them goodnight to show that you're thinking of them. If you call during the day, keep it short but sweet.
 On your calender, mark the halfway point of your spouse's trip. Work towards that first half, crossing off every day they've been gone. Once you complete that, the second part will get easier.
 Make plans with family and friends, or get around to those things you've been putting off. Even if money won't allow you to do something special every day, new experiences will give you something to share with your spouse upon their return, and will return happiness to your life.
 If you think happy thoughts, you will be happy.
 Improve yourself while your partner is away. Break those bad habits, start the diet you've been talking about. Present them with a brand new you when they return.
 It'll soothe you and allow you to be stronger, since those pent-up emotions won't be weighing you down.

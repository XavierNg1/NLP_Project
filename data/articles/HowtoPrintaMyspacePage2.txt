 After you've gone to the page you want to print, simply right click on your computer mouse. This will bring up a menu on your screen. Among the options in that menu is “print.”


Click on “print.” A new page will open up that is the print screen. Under “destination” on this page, you will see the printers available. Choose the one you want.
You can also change the number of copies you want to print. The default will be set at 1. Now, all you have to do is hit the “print” button, and the page should print. You will have to do this for each page you want to print.
 Another option is to choose “Control P” on your computer keyboard if you don’t want to use the mouse. On a Mac, this function would be “Command P.”The process is the same. You will see a print page, and must hit the “print” button after selecting the printer you want to use, and the number of copies.
Remember that these steps work for printing any computer page, not just a page on Myspace. On some computers, the Control button is "CTRL."

, This is another way to print a computer screen page, including your Myspace page.


Open the side menu of your browser (if you are using Chrome). Open the menu of your browser (if you are using Firefox).
Select “print.” Print the page.

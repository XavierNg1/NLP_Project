 Ingesting a large amount or high concentration of hydrogen peroxide can cause difficulty breathing. If a victim loses consciousness and exhibits shallow breathing, a weak pulse, or no breathing or pulse, you (or someone CPR certified) should administer CPR and call emergency services immediately.Even if the victim can breathe and CPR isn’t required, emergency personnel may still offer a respiratory mask to someone who’s ingested hydrogen peroxide, especially at higher concentrations.
 You’ll require emergency assistance if the victim has ingested large amounts of household hydrogen peroxide or a high concentration solution. You can call emergency services or your local poison control center. If you live in the United States, call poison control at 1-800-222-1222.Be prepared to describe the victim’s age, weight, and condition. Tell the emergency operator the name of the product ingested and solution strength. Let them know the time and amount that they swallowed.
 Drinking 4 to 8 ounces (120 to 240 mL) of water or milk may effectively treat ingestion of a small amount of household hydrogen peroxide. For cases involving larger amounts or higher concentrations, you should still drink water or milk, but be sure to contact emergency services as soon as possible.Try gargling repeatedly with cool water if your mouth is the only affected area.
 While hydrogen peroxide can cause vomiting, you should not induce it if the victim is not vomiting already. You should also avoid using activated charcoal, as it will have no effect on ingested hydrogen peroxide.If your case is severe enough for hospitalization, medical professionals will administer an endoscopy to examine your digestive tract. Activated charcoal will interfere with this examination.

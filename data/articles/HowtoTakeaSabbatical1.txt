 You are much more likely to be granted a sabbatical after you have been working for your employer for several years and have become well respected by your boss.However, if the reasons for your sabbatical are time-sensitive and clearly benefit the company, it might be worth asking even if you do not meet these criteria.


For example, an intensive training course that would teach you job-relevant skills might be a compelling reason for the company to grant you a short sabbatical even as a relatively new employee.;
, Talk to the personnel department to find out if your company has an official sabbatical policy. If it does, your company may offer no pay, partial pay, or full pay. Many companies do not have an official policy, but may be willing to grant a sabbatical anyway if you make a good argument as described in the steps below.


Make sure your job will be kept open for you during a sabbatical.
Check whether your benefits will be suspended, and whether alternate health care plans or other benefits will still be available through your company., There are many reasons why a sabbatical will make you a better employee. Any sabbatical should leave you more motivated and creative after your return, and a company struggling financially may appreciate the short-term savings of granting a sabbatical. However, try to come up with more specific plans, along with reasons they would benefit the company:


Will your travels abroad or participation with a volunteer organization provide new language skills, international contacts, or cultural understanding that will assist you in your job?Will you learn new skills, either through classes, self-directed projects, or visiting other organizations?
See the section on "getting the most out of your sabbatical" for more ideas.
 Sometimes, you'll only need a few weeks off to take a training course or get certified in a specific task. Only ask for more than three months off if you are well-respected, a longtime employee, and have a compelling reason why the longer sabbatical is necessary. Unlike in the academic world, taking a corporate sabbatical for too long could hurt your reputation in the organization., Present a plan that describes the benefits to the company and yourself as a worker, and proposes a duration for your sabbatical. Mention that you are willing to train an interim employee if necessary, or to assist coworkers who may be taking on some of your duties.


If possible, make your request six months before the intended start date of your sabbatical, so your supervisor and coworkers have time to make necessary changes.
 If your employer will not pay you during your sabbatical, you will need to finance your break by yourself. Try to save money in advance by paying off debts, and reducing expenditures. If this isn't enough, consider the following options:


Take out a home equity loan, or ask for personal loans from family and friends.
If your sabbatical lasts longer than a couple weeks, spend it in a region with a much lower cost of living. If you rent out your old place, sublet it with the permission of your landlord, or arrange a house swap, you could reduce your costs significantly, or even break even.
Consider getting a part time job, such as freelancing or pet-sitting.
 If the company cannot function without you for the length of your sabbatical, it may need to find a temporary employee to cover for you. Train this person in your duties before you leave, or show willing coworkers how to cover your most important or time-sensitive duties while you're gone.
 If you have any recent job experience or certification that needs to go on your curriculum vitae, add it to the CV now. You may not remember to do this after you return from sabbatical.
 You can "make your own sabbatical" by resigning, then pursuing other non-work opportunities. After several months or even a couple years, you can search for a new job. There are obvious risks to this plan, as there is no guarantee you can get another job promptly. However, if you have the financial security to take an independent break, and you are pursuing genuine goals, you can put your "sabbatical" accomplishments on your resume when you decide to apply for a job again.

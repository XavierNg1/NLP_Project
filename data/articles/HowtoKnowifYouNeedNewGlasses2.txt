 It’s easy to simply keep on wearing your glasses without worrying too much about your prescription over time. However, almost everyone’s eyesight naturally weakens over time. Even if you don’t think your prescription needs to be changed, schedule yourself an eye exam every one or two years at the very least.If you’re over sixty years of age, or have complications with your eye health, yearly checkups are especially important.
 You’ll likely start by sharing any frustration or discomfort you’ve experienced when speaking with your optometrist. However, it’s important to mention anything that you’ve noticed about your vision since you last saw your optometrist, even if it doesn’t seem too significant.Note things like, “I’ve realized it’s harder to see things that are moving quickly, like a tennis ball.”
If you’ve been experiencing headaches, be sure to mention where they occur in your head, and what you’re usually doing when the headaches occur.
 One of the benefits of getting regular eye exams is taking advantage of new technologies. This applies to both assessment equipment, as well as actual eyeglasses. In fact, improvements in lens design are somewhat frequent, and more and more types of lens are becoming available.Especially if you tend to use your glasses for one thing in particular, or notice issues with your vision during certain types of activities, ask your doctor something like, “Is there another type of lens I should try considering what we’ve talked about?”
In fact, you may find that your prescription is fine, but that a different type of lens will give you even better vision.

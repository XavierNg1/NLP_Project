 After finding all of the pieces, the following will happen:


The Ghost Medal will then form together and unlock Ghost Kirby.
Multiple ghosts will fly into all eight worlds.
Instead of a mini boss, a Ghost will appear with little ghosts around it.;
, You will then turn into Ghost Kirby. (If you already unlocked the secret world in the middle of the map, the Ghost Kirby bubble will appear.)


(Also, you can get the Ghost Kirby power by getting all pieces of the map that will lead you to the room with all the powers in the game.)

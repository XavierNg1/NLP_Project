 If you plan on refilling your empty water bottle to drink from it again, using a BPA-free bottle is your safest bet. Water bottles are made from a variety of plastics, and these plastics, like BPA, can leach. Exposure to BPA has been linked with diabetes and cardiovascular disease in humans.A more suitable alternative for a refillable water bottle would be a stainless steel or glass bottle. These do not leach.;
, A bottle meant for reuse will typically have a wide opening that will allow you to clean the bottle easily.Refrain from drinking from a refilled, disposable plastic water bottle. Disposable plastic bottles are hard to clean, so they can easily host bacterial growth. They also contain chemicals which could cause cancer or reproductive health problems., You should use hot soapy water to clean your bottle. Do this at least every two days to minimize bacterial contamination. As long as you clean your bottle, you should not have to worry about chemicals from a non-BPA bottle leaching into your water., Let your bottle air dry. You can also use a dishwasher to dry your refillable water bottle as long as the bottle does not contain BPA, since heat will increase the rate at which chemicals leach from the plastic.

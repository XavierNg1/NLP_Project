 If you're not receiving the notifications you want, find “Settings” at the top of your Facebook home page and click “Notifications” on the left. Here you can access settings for notifications of all types including: email notifications, push notifications on your phone, app requests and notifications, group notifications, close friend notifications, pop-up notifications, or event notifications

, Open your notifications list. In the corner of each listed notification is an ‘x’ icon. Click this to disable future notifications from this source specifically.


Note that the notification you clicked next to will not be removed.
 Private messages and friend requests will not appear in the general notifications list. Press the ‘people’ icon to view a list of friend requests and the ‘chat box’ icon to view private messages sent to you (this includes Facebook chat).

 Easter attire traditionally reflects the colors of the blooming trees and flowers of spring. Select Easter Sunday clothing in pastel hues, such as yellow, lavender and pink.


Opt for colors that flatter your skin tone. Not everyone looks good in pastel colors. If pastels make you look washed out, consider brighter tones. For example, instead of wearing a pastel yellow, choose a canary yellow that brightens your complexion.
Pair pastels with dark colors for women's Easter outfits. Depending on your shape, an all-pastel outfit may not be flattering. Women may pair a pastel top with a navy skirt or black pants for a more flattering outfit that incorporates traditional Easter tones.
Add color to men's outfits with pastel shirts. Men can add a subtle splash of color to Easter Sunday outfits by incorporating colors like melon, robin's egg blue and mint green into shirts, sweaters or ties. These pastel hues pair well with khaki, wheat and camel tones for a masculine Easter look.
 Because Easter marks the beginning of spring, floral prints are popular options for Easter Sunday attire. Consider floral sundresses, skirts, blouses or accessories.


Choose flattering floral patterns for women. Large patterns add bulk and can make women look heavier. Women with larger frames usually are better suited to delicately patterned floral tops paired with solid color bottoms.
Consider a floral jacket or cardigan for a chilly day. A floral jacket or cardigan provides layering versatility for an Easter Sunday outfit while also incorporating a springtime motif.
Select floral ties for men. Easter Sunday is not the appropriate time to wear a floral Hawaiian shirt. Rather, men may incorporate a sophisticated floral pattern into a tie or handkerchief paired with a suit.

 The soil should never be allowed to dry out. After the first two years, water it when the top inch or two of soil becomes dry., If the boxwood it not getting enough water or if is getting too much water, it will appear drought-stressed with brown or yellow leaves.
 This will help the soil to retain moisture and keep the roots cooler in the summer.


Shredded bark mulch is ideal.
 Keep it back a few inches to reduce the likelihood of stem disease brought on by excessive moisture.
 Sprinkle fertilizer with a 10-10-10 ratio (Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium or N-P-K) evergreen shrub fertilizer on the soil beginning 6 inches from the stems and extending to about 2 feet beyond the outer edge of the shrub branches., Water the fertilizer into the soil. If the soil is very sandy, give the boxwood a second dose of fertilizer towards the end of spring. Fertilizer is washed out of sandy soil more quickly than loamy or clay soil.
 Doing this could cause the boxwood to grow new leaves in the fall. These new leaves may not be mature enough to withstand winter weather without sustaining damage.
 Boxwoods that are not given enough fertilizer will grow very slowly. Too much fertilizer will cause brown, burned areas along the leaf edges.

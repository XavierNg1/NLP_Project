 Focus on your thumb while you inhale. Focus on an object 10 feet (3.0Â m) away while you exhale, and repeat 15 times to increase eye flexibility.
 Scan the edges of your vision in a circle for 2 minutes. Breathe while you keep your eyes moving around the room in a fluid motion.
 Place cupped hands in front of your eyes, making sure the palms do not directly touch the eyes. Stare into your palms for 20 to 30 seconds, until your vision becomes darker.


When you see almost complete darkness, you will know your eyes are relaxed and you can continue. Studies have shown that eyestrain and visual stress place you at a risk for glaucoma. A few eye exercises or resting periods each day can help to reduce the risk.
 Lower your neck so that it almost sits on your right shoulder. Breathe deeply and roll your neck from your right shoulder, past your collarbone to the left shoulder.


Repeat this exercise 10 to 20 times in a slow, fluid motion.
 Allow the toes to curl until they are at a right angle to your feet. Hold for 10 seconds and repeat if necessary.
 Repeat the motion for 15 seconds and then switch to a counter-clockwise motion.
 Breathe deeply and raise them slowly until they are straight up in the air. Raise 1 hand a time, as if you are trying to pick apples of a tree, then lower it and raise your opposite arm.


Repeat 10 times with each arm before slowly lowering them to the ground. On the last 2 repetitions, when you are done with your "apple pickers," lean back in your chair. Gently arch your back and take your arms back as far as they can go.
 Place your palm down and push down gently on the top of the wrist with the other hand for 10 seconds. Place your palm face up and push gently on the tops of your fingers with the other hand.

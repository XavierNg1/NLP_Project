 It's an app that appears as gray cogs, which can usually be found on one of your home screens.


If you can’t find the app on one of your home screens, it may be in a folder labeled Utilities.
 It’s located at the end of the third section.
 It’s the first option, at the top of the menu.
 The space to the right of the button should be white. Now your location will not be shared with any apps.


This function can always be re-enabled by sliding the button to the “On” position (the space to the left of the button will turn green).
Note that location services is required for many apps to function properly (such as GPS tracking).
You can also enable or disable Location Services for specific apps (in the list below the “Share My Location” option).

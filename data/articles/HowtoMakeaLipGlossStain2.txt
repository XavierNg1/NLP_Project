 Heat the petroleum jelly for 30 seconds, then take it out and stir. You want it to be fully melted into a liquid for this, so put it back in the microwave for 15 second increments until it reaches the desired consistency.


Be careful! The petroleum jelly will be very hot, so handle with care.
 Add only a little Kool-Aid powder at a time, stir, and then keep adding until you reach your desired shade.Use presweetened Kool-Aid powder if you want your final product to be sweet.
Feel free to experiment by combining different Kool-Aid flavors to create customized hues!

, Add a few drops of water (at most, ¼ tsp) to the mixture and you will notice that the color is “activated” and the hue becomes vibrant.


Continue mixing until the water is fully blended in.
 A contact lens case would be great for this, or one of those small, round pill containers that can be found in pharmacies, or you can re-purpose an empty lip gloss pot.


The lip gloss stain will be ready to use within an hour, once the mixture cools and sets.
 Melt 1 cup of petroleum jelly in the microwave, stirring at 30 second intervals until you have a liquid.Add the Kool-Aid powder to the liquid until you reach your desired shade. Stir very well until fully blended.


Pour the mixture into small containers and allow to cool and set over the course of a few hours.
Use presweetened Kool-Aid for this, if possible.
If you only have unsweetened Kool-Aid, add 1-2 packets of sweetener (to taste) to the mixture so that your gloss won’t be bitter., Buy some cute little tins or pots (try craft stores or order online) and pour your lip gloss stain mixture into them. Allow them to cool and set (give them a couple of hours).


Create and print out nice labels on sticker paper for the little pots, or decorate them however you wish.
These make awesome gifts – but don’t forget to keep a few for yourself!

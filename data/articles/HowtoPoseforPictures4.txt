 The same rules apply to couples shots as with individual. If you are posing with someone else, try to avoid stiffness and inequality between the two of you. Make sure you and anyone else in the photo is acting equally relaxed so that no one stands out with an unnatural pose.


Don't take photos head on, make sure to angle your body., Instead of having a group of people all mimicking the same pose, allow everyone to stand comfortably in their own way or pose each person differently.


Having everyone pose differently gives the photo a natural look. It also helps avoid someone standing out as the best or worst if everyone is posing the same way., The tendency for group photos is to take them all from the front and center. Instead, try taking group and couples photos from different sides and directions to place the focus on different people in the group.


Instead of having everyone look at the camera, have people look at each other. This is a great way to pose if you are taking a couples photo. Look at each other or have one of you look at the other., Because a group or couples photo has more than one subject, having too much happening in the background can be distracting to the eye. Instead, use a shallow depth of field or a quiet background to place the focus on the people.

 This will make finding the pet even harder. Instead, get your eyes ready for a search.;
, Just remember: the pet can't have gone far yet.
 If the pet didn't get loose on a designated "lot," then turn on the Collection Helper (if you have it) and set it to whatever kind of pet you lost. You can get it with 40,000 Lifetime Happiness points, which you can earn by fulfilling Sim wishes or making them happy. (Not sure if this works but you can try)

, If you lost the pet inside, it will turn up eventually. But if you lost it while outside, then search fast.
 If you see the pet, then get a Sim that's free, click on the pet, and choose "Recapture ."

, Place the pet in a terrarium so it doesn't escape again!

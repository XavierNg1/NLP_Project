 Is it very strong or is it extremely weak? What things can be done to strengthen and improve your relationship? Mentally work out what areas you and your brother/sister could work on, but do not confront your sibling yet.;
, Is your sibling at the point where he/she is going through puberty or is it you? This could cause you and/or your sibling to deal with each other more differently and erupt into fights more often. If this appears to be the case, know that the situation isn't permanent and let puberty run its course while you try to make the situation as comfortable and best as possible.
 Are there some things that you and/or your sibling has done that resulted in your situation and relationship today? Perhaps you didn't mean to humiliate your sibling on his/her birthday, but if you never apologized for that and/or your sibling is holding a grudge against you, that could be why he/she fights with you a lot. Maybe it's even you that is holding a grudge against your sibling.

 Make sure that the wire is thin enough to go through your bead.
 Bring the wire 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of the way through the looped part of the bobby pin.
 Twist the wire only 2 to 3 times. Next, use a pair of wire cutters to snip the stub off as close to the twists as possible.
 Move the bead to the bumpy side of the bobby pin. This is technically the underside of the bobby pin, but the grooves will give the beads and the wires something to hold on to.
 You may have to push the bobby pin open so that you can get the wire between the two prongs. Do not wrap the wire around both prongs, or you won't be able to use the bobby pin.


The bead may start to shift as you wrap the wire. If this starts to happen, use your fingers to hold the bead in place.
 Give the wire a gentle tug first, then thread the bead onto it. Hold the bead in place as you wrap the bead through the bobby pin once more.
 How many beads you use will depend on the side of your bobby pin as well as the size of the of the beads. The smaller the beads are, the more beads you will need.


The beads can be different colors, but they should all be the same shape and size.
 Wrap the wire about three times, as tightly as you can. This will seal your beadwork shut.
 If the beads have large enough holes, you can wrap the wire back through the beads and under the bobby pin prong. If the holes are too small, simply pull the wire under three beads (keep it between the beads and the top of the bobby pin). Snip the excess wire off with a pair of wire cutters.


For added security, add a drop of glue under the wrapped wire at the tip of your bobby pin. Use jewelry glue; it dries clear and is suitable for metal.

 You don't want to get a game over on round 6 do you??

Find people you can rely on, like friends you know are good at Zombies and Call of Duty in general.
 You want to get a third gun and pack-a-punch it., For more points, do 7 Shots in the leg and a knife, until round 4+., The person with the second least amount of points should open the second door upstairs(the 2 people with the most points should open). Do not open the downstairs doors because this will make it a lot harder on you later in the game., Camp in the containing the MP40 until after the first hellhound round has been passed (the first hellhound round should come at around level 6).,

Have everyone save up until they have 8450 points and then turn on the power.
Have everyone buy Juggernaut and a random box if you know where it is. (You can find out its position by looking at the light above any random box.)
You should still have 5000 points left so link the teleport and all of you use it at the same time. (It should now be around level 11).
 Have the people who are waiting to upgrade or who have already upgraded throw grenades at the zombies below (you can buy them off the wall next to you for 250 points)., Proceed outside through the doors in the power room not the first room.,, This will give you time to go and get some., After this, it becomes very difficult and the chances are that you will die very quickly, but by this point you should have reached about round 24-26.

 If your child has had a sudden change in the frequency or consistency of his or her bowel movements, then diarrhea is probably to blame. You can treat your child’s diarrhea at home, but you should still talk to your child’s pediatrician about the best course of action. Diarrhea can be the result of food sensitivities, infections, or something else that may need medical treatment.
 When diarrhea lasts for less than two weeks, it is called acute diarrhea. This form of diarrhea is common, but it can be severe. Acute diarrhea may be due to:Inflammation
Bacterial or viral infections
Antibiotic use
Food sensitivities, food allergies, or food “poisoning”

, Chronic diarrhea is less common, but it can also be severe. Chronic diarrhea is when diarrhea lasts for more than two weeks. Chronic diarrhea may be due to:Dietary factors
Infections
Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Celiac disease

, Your child’s diarrhea should improve within three to four days. If your child does not improve and/or your child shows signs of dehydration, then call your physician right away. Take your child to the emergency room if you cannot reach your physician. Signs of dehydration in children include:Crying without any tears
Dry or sticky mouth or tongue
Sunken-looking eyes
Infrequent urination or dry diapers
Lethargy or excessive sleepiness
Increased irritability
Dizziness
Vomiting
Fever over 101°F (38.3°C)

, Some serious symptoms may accompany diarrhea that can indicate an emergency situation. Take your child to an emergency room or call 911 if you notice any of these serious symptoms, which include:Bloody stools
Lots of vomiting or vomiting blood or green bile
Abdomen that is distended, tender, or enlarged

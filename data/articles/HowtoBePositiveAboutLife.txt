 Not so much that people are scared of you, but so people feel relaxed about talking to you. This will help you make lots of friends and make you feel better about yourself.;
, Instead of, for example, thinking, "This article is rubbish," think "mm. This article isn't bad." Don't rush yourself into making judgment. You aren't running for Jesus, so just take it bit by bit, and soon, you will be positive in no time.
 Think of the future. Ignore those who deliberately try to hurt you, and focus on those who have always been there for you.
 Nagging makes other people feel insecure and annoyed. Stand your ground, don't just agree with what they say, or they will think you are boring. Come across as interesting, even if you aren't.
 Have a nice relaxing shower or bath, and you will feel clean and refreshed.
 That means you have more time to relax, instead of worrying and letting it hang over you.
 It doesn't matter if you're laughing about something your friend said last week or something you read or saw, it matters that you are laughing.
 A smile is just as good. A smile brings a warmness and content, making you happy for a short period of time. So smile back.

 This is easy to make and can be put in the corner of the room that has a wasp problem.


Scissors
Empty plastic bottle (2L)
Tape
Bait (watered down dish soap);
, Be sure to do this carefully with your scissors. You can also use a razor blade if the scissors don’t seem to be cutting through the bottle.
 If you want to add vinegar, it will still attract the wasps but won’t attract bees.
 This is going to form your at-home trap.
 The wasps will be attracted to the bait, fly through the neck of the bottle, and get stuck in the bottom where they will die.


If you wish to hang it, heat two ends of a wire and stick them into either side of the bottle and hang it once the wire is secure.
 If too many wasps die, they can make a sort of raft for other wasps to live on in the bottom of the trap.

 For a quarterly investment, the formula to calculate the annual rate of return is: Annual Rate of Return = - 1. The number 4 is an exponent. In other words, the quantity "1 + quarterly rate of return" is raised to the fourth power, and then 1 is subtracted from the result., Again let's say your quarterly ROR is 1.5%. First divide 1.5 by divide it by 100. 1.5 percent divided by 100 is 0.015., Continuing this example, use 0.015 as the quarterly ROR. Thus, the annual rate of return = (1 + 0.015) raised to the fourth power.


Add 1 to 0.015 and you get 1.015.
 If you do not have a calculator that works with exponents, you can search for one on the Internet or buy one at your local office supplies store. 1.015 to the fourth power is 1.061364.


You can always multiply 1.015 x 1.015 x 1.015 x 1.015 if you don't have a calculator.
The example formula now looks like this: Annual Rate Of Return = 1.061364 - 1.
 This equals .061364. This is your annual ROR expressed as a decimal. Multiply that decimal by 100 to get your percent rate of return.In our example, .061364 x 100 = 6.1364% for the annual rate of return.

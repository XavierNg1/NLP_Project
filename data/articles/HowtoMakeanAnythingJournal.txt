 Find a journal that you like, or you can even use a composition book if you want. The choice is yours. It is your journal after all. Make sure that the journal has enough pages, and that the pages are large enough to hold more than one photo or item.;
, Find anything that you saw that you might like. That might include a magazine, photos, poems, music, or anything you like!

, Look through the magazine and other things that you have gathered and find what you would like to put into your journal.
 Cut out all the things that you liked. Make sure to cut them a little larger that needed so that you have room for editing and trimming if you need.
 Try different spots on the page(s) for where you can place the things. If you think there's too much available space, spruce up your page with embellishments or ribbon. Even try tape! Don't glue your things down until your sure that there isn't a better spot or place to put that in.
 After taking a final placement check, glue in your things one at a time. Don't put too much glue, as the pages will get very stiff and your pictures will have very many creases due to the glue. This is especially important with magazine clippings, because they are so thin. Try spreading out the glue to avoid that problem.
 Maybe you want to trim the edges, or write something in describing what that item is.
 Then when its done, you can enjoy all the memories and thoughts that you had.

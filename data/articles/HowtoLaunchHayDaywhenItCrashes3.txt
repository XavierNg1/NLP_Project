 Sometimes your device may have lots of apps running at the same time. This consumes a lot of system memory and can slow down your device and the apps.


If your device is an iOS, double-click the Home button to see all the running apps.
For Android, open the Application Manager from the Settings, and swipe to the left to see the list of Running apps.
 Closing some of the apps you’re currently not using can help free up some memory and speed up your device.


For iOS devices, swipe up on each of the app you aren’t using to close them.
For Android, tap on each of the app you aren’t using, then tap the “Stop” button.
 Though not necessary, restarting your device can sometimes help free up memory and speed up your apps.
 Tap the Hay Day app icon on your home screen or app drawer. Once open, you can play the game where you left off.

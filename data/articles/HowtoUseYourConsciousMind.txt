 It's all in the subconscious.


There is a technique similar to affirmations, and some call it affirmations, look it up if you like. "Generally", you ask positive questions towards life/problems/goals/tasks/wishes in front of you to easily motivate yourself to do them.

, Once your conscious mind understands and learns this tool more, you will be able to better direct and develop it into any part/area of life you want!!

, Ex: If you need to do laundry, you should start with something like this:


What are some good reasons to start and continue my laundry?

It will make me feel better about myself.
I have enough free time right now to do it.
It isn't hard at all, after I start, I will probably want to do it!


What should I do first to achieve this goal?

Get up and pick up my clothes!
What's something little I can reward myself for this achievement?
I will already feel better for doing it.
I'll eat two straw-berries with homemade whipped cream on it.
 Make sure you complete the little things! Once you build up this "tool," you'll learn how to direct your life, by doing asking the right questions towards things you can see now! Even if it is one little thing, start with something!

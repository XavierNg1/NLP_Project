 Wash the container. Then use a hot air blower or a hair dryer to help peel off any labels still on it. Set it at a low level of heat, to avoid burning your skin or melting the container.


Choose the container that looks like a jar, the type which has an oval hole made for ease of handling.





;
, Cover this line with painter's tape. The barely visible seams that join together the two sides of the container will help you stick the tape symmetrically.
 Move the cutter with a sawing motion to avoid getting stuck.


Wear gloves to protect your hands while cutting and keep a steady hand.
 Hold the cap tightly in the vise until it cracks loose. You may have to move the bottle around a little to achieve this.


Again, be sure to wear gloves to protect your hands.
 For instance, mount it on a board in the same manner as in Part #3 for the holster below and it can hold the light that often comes with cordless drill/driver sets.
 This will avoid sliced hands while using the holster/container. DO NOT OVERHEAT as this will melt/warp the holster.


Wear gloves to protect your hands while heating and do not touch the plastic until cooled.
 Cut or poke a screwdriver/awl through this hole in a central position, making it about 2 to 3cm/1-1.5" down from the new rim of the bottle. See the image for guidance. The drill holder is now completed and all you need to do is attach it somewhere convenient on your workbench.


Rotate the screwdriver or awl to get a neat hole.



You could also drill a hole for the chuck key, if desired. This will keep it handy and secure.
 Use a screw with a washer––the washer will prevent tearing of the plastic when the weight of the drill is added inside.


The screw and washer must be sturdy enough to withstand normal use.
 Use the holder to store the plugged-in drill. When you're finished, unplug and wind the flex around the drill. Done!

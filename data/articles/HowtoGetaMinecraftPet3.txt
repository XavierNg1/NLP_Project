 Fences with a fence gate makes a great barrier, as you can still see the animals but they cannot jump over the blocks. This can be done by holding the respective food, they are as follows


Sheep - wheat
Pig - carrot
Cow and Mooshroom - wheat
Chicken - wheat seeds

, If you want to keep the animals you just lured, make sure they can't escape.
 Using the same food that you lured the animal with, feed two of the animals and let them breed. You can then make more animals to breed with, and harvest the parents.

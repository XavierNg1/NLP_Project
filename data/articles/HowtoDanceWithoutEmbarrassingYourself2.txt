 In order to dance to music, you need to be able to identify the beat. Listen to a song and try and tap your foot or clap your hands along to the beat. Depending on the song, the beat may be slow or fast. When you are first learning to identify the beat, listen to music that has a strong drum beat. This will make it easier for you to hear the rhythm.For example, try dancing to Beyonce's "Crazy in Love" or The Bee Gee's "Night Fever.", Once you have identified the beat of the music, you can try moving your body to the beat. When you are first learning to dance, it is best to isolate different movements. Begin by keeping your feet firmly planted on the ground and move your arms to the beat of the song. You can move your arms from side to side or up and down.Your arms are also connected to your shoulders and torso, so try moving them as well.
Experiment with non-linear arm movements by creating waves.
 Now that your arms are moving to the music, try adding in your feet. You can start out simple, by picking up one foot and then the other, kind of like marching on the spot. As you get more comfortable you can try bending your knees and bouncing in time with the music. Continue to bounce and then add in steps to the side.Try to incorporate your hips and other parts of your lower body into your dance movement.
 Search online for dance studios in your area and research the different beginner classes available. Choose a dance style that you are interested in learning. For example, you could try hip hop, jazz, contemporary, ballroom, etc.Alternatively, if you are looking for something more casual, you could find a dance class at a local community centre or YMCA.
You can also watch instructional dance videos online or purchase one on DVD.

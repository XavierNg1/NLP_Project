 Fill a bowl with lukewarm water and add a few drops of liquid soap into it. Stir the solution enough so that the soap and water combine but not so much that it begins to foam.


Use a mild liquid soap, such as hand soap or dish soap. Avoid harsh detergents as they can damage the amber.;
, Microfiber or flannel work best. Dip the cloth into the bowl and wring it out so that there is no dripping water left. You want the cloth to be damp, not wet.
 Wipe the jewelry again immediately afterward with a dry cloth to dry it.If you are cleaning more than one piece of jewelry, clean and dry each piece separately. Do not leave the amber to dry by itself, or you risk it turning cloudy.
 This not only removes grease marks, but also helps polish the amber. Apply a small amount of oil to your hands, and then rub the oil over the amber. Wipe it away immediately afterwards with a soft, dry cloth.


If you do not have olive oil, you can use almond oil instead.

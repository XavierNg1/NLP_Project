 When the other person finds out that you told a lie, your trust quotient will go down. Tell the truth.;
, In that way, they won't think you are keeping something from them.
 You don't define your whole self through one breach of trust, so forgive yourself and build on what is strong and desirable in yourself instead of wallowing about what has happened.
 Help the other person know that they can rely on you from here on by being reliable and doing things or turning up when you say you will. Help them to see that you've learned your lesson and won't be repeating it around them.
 Earning back trust can take a long time, depending on whom you've hurt. For some people who hold high standards and deep grudges, it can take a lifetime but you don't need to judge yourself by their inability to forgive. Just keep being trustworthy around them and your own account is settled, whatever choice they make.

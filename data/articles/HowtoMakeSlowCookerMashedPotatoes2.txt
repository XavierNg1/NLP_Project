 Wash the spuds and use a peeler to remove the skins from about 4 pounds (2 kg) of russet potatoes. Then, place the potatoes on a cutting board and quarter them or chop them into one-inch (2.5 cm) chunks. The smaller the pieces of potato, the more evenly they will cook., Place the potato chunks in a 6-quart (5.5 L) slow cooker. Add ½ cup (120 mL) of beef stock and 2 tablespoons (28 g) of butter. Cover and cook on high for 3 to 4 hours or on low for 7 to 8 hours., While the potatoes cook, peel and dice 2 pounds (1 kg) of onions. Add the onions to a nonstick pan. Cover and cook them over medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes. Once the onions begin to brown and stick to the pan, remove the lid and lower the heat to low. Add 1-tablespoon (15 mL) of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt. Cook the onion for another 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.If you refrigerate them properly, you can cook the onions ahead of time. You can also cook them one hour before you intend to mash the potatoes.
 Once your potatoes are soft, you should warm ½ cup (120 mL) of heavy whipping cream, 3 tablespoons (42 g) of butter, and ¼ cup (60 mL) of milk on the stovetop or in the microwave. Cook the mixture until the butter melts and then pour it in with the potatoes. Use a masher or an electric mixer to smash the potatoes. Finally, mix in ½ cup (50g) of shredded Gruyere cheese and the majority of your caramelized onions.Be sure to set aside some caramelized onions to serve as a garnish for your potatoes.
Add salt and pepper to taste.

 This means to stack the numbers on top of each other, as you normally would when multiplying. Note that this method only works for products through 19×19{\displaystyle 19\times 19}.

For example, if you are multiplying 18×16{\displaystyle 18\times 16}, you would write or think of the numbers with the ones digits lined up vertically (the 8 and the 6), and the tens digits lined up vertically (the two 1s). It doesn’t matter which number is on top.

, You might visualize this as a shape that looks like the African continent. The only digit that should not be inside the circle is the bottom tens digits.For example, if you are multiplying 18×16{\displaystyle 18\times 16}, you would draw a circle encompassing 18 and 6.
 You should be adding the top number and the bottom ones digit. Make sure you add rather than multiply.

For example, 18+6=24{\displaystyle 18+6=24}.
 You can do this easily by adding a 0 to the end of the number. Set this number aside, as it is your first partial product.

For example, 24×10=240{\displaystyle 24\times 10=240}.
 Make sure you multiply this time, instead of adding. This is the second partial product.

For example, 8×6=48{\displaystyle 8\times 6=48}.
 This will give you the product of your two original factors.For example, 240+48=288{\displaystyle 240+48=288}. Thus, 18×16=288{\displaystyle 18\times 16=288}.

 If you comment on someone's photos, they are most likely to check your photo stream out. The more comments, the better.;
, Adding somebody's image as a favorite is even better then commenting. If somebody added your photo as a fave, you'd check their photo stream out, wouldn't you? That's how other people are!

, They will probably comment on your gallery saying: Thanks for adding my photo to your gallery!

, The most clever way is to add your photo to groups. There are very good nature groups out there, that a lot of nature lovers add their photos to. Or, you could try a dog group if you are interested in dogs.
 If you go to someones profile, there will be a little yellow envelope at the top. Click it, and you can send this person flickr mail. You should start by saying you love their photos and if they reply, they will look at yours and then reply, saying they love yours! The easiest way to get attention on Flickr, would be making friends. Some users will check out your photo stream from time to time to see if you have uploaded anything new.

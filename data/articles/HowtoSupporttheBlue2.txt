 If someone is committing a small crime, e.g. smoking in a nonsmoking area or not wearing a seat belt, say "Please don't do that. That can hurt people/you." Be watchful for larger crimes that take place.


Call the tip line, if you recognize a perpetrator who is on a video shown on the local TV news showing the commission of a crime, or on "most-wanted" posters at the U.S. Post Office.
Join or organize a neighborhood crime watch association.
 Sometimes looters will take advantage of the activity to try to cause harm. Encourage peaceful protesters to go stop the looters if they see it happening.

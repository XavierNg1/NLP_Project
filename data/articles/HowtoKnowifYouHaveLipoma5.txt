 The most effective way of getting rid of lipoma tumor is having it surgically removed. Generally, surgery is only reserved for tumors that have grown to roughly three centimeters in size. Lipomas usually will not grow back after being removed, but rarely they will return. When the tumor is right underneath your skin, a slight incision is made in your skin, the growth is removed, and then the wound is cleaned and patched up.
If the tumor is located in an organ, which is much more rare, than you will have to go under general anesthesia to have the tumor removed.
 The technique uses suction to remove the fatty tissue. Generally people who choose this option are wanting the tumor removed for aesthetic reasons. It is also used in cases where the growth is softer than normal.Keep in mind that liposuction creates a small scar, but it will become invisible after it is completely healed.
 This is the least invasive way of getting rid of a lipoma tumor. A mixture of steroids (triamcinolone acetonide and one percent lidocaine) is injected into the middle of your tumor. If the growth doesnâ€™t go away within a month, the procedure can be done again until it does go away.

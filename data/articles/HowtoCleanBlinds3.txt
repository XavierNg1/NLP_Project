 Get two "S" hooks and hang them on the inside of your shower curtain rod. Make sure the shower curtain is pulled to one side. Detach the set of blinds from above the window and bring them into the bathroom. Hang the blinds on the bottom of the "S" hooks by looping them through the thin metal rod at the top of the blinds. Make sure it is secure. Turn on the faucet and allow the water to grow warm. Squirt some soap on a soft scrub brush and wet it in the water. Scrub the blinds thoroughly.


Start from the top and scrub from side to side. If you have vertical blinds, scrub them up and down.






Rinse the scrub brush and add more soap as needed.






Flip the blinds to the opposite position and scrub each blind on the other side.






Run the water through the shower head and use it to rinse the blinds when you're finished scrubbing.






Let the blinds drip dry, or use a towel to dry them off. Rehang your gleaming blinds.
 Extra dirty blinds can be washed outside with a hose. Take your blinds outside and lay them on a mat or rug. Fill a bucket with soapy water. Use a scrub brush or sponge to scrub the blinds on both sides. Use a garden hose to rinse the blinds on both sides. Towel them off and rehang.

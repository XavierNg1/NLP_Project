 The screen will say "Welcome to NX" at the top.  To begin modeling, click on "File" at the top left corner, then click "New" from the drop-down menu.;
, When the New window opens, make sure the "Model" tab is selected at the top and that the "Model" row is highlighted in blue in the Templates box.  Select your units (millimeters will be used for this tutorial), name your part, and select a folder in which you want to save the file.  Click "OK".
 In the top, left corner, there will be a button labeled "Extrude". Click the small arrow to the right of the Extrude button to open the drop-down menu. Click on "Sphere". This will open a small window on the left side of your screen.
 Within the "Sphere" window, select "Center Point and Diameter" under the Type drop-down menu. Here you would input the center point and diameter of your sphere, but for this tutorial, keep the center point at the origin (this is the default setting so you don't need to click anything) and input 100 for the diameter. Click "OK".
 First recall the Sphere command as you did in step 2. Again, choose "Center Point and Diameter" as the Type. Next to "Specify Point", click on the grey button with the plus sign. This will open a window titled "Point".
 XC, YC, and ZC represent the 3-Dimensional center point for your second sphere. For this tutorial, select "inferred point" as the Type and input 0, 45, and 60 for XC, YC, and ZC respectively (see image above). Click "OK". Input 65 as the Diameter and select "Unite" under the Boolean drop-down menu (see image in step 5). Click "OK".
 Under the "File" drop-down menu (see step 1), place your cursor over "Close". When the sub-menu opens, click on "Save and Close". This will return you to the initial welcome menu.

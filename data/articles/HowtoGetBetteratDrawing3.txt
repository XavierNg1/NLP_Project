 Your object has volume and weight, which, when light falls on it, results in shadows and highlights. Instead of drawing the outline of your object, try starting by sketching a well-balanced separation of light and dark areas.


Approach shadows as you would a flat, graphic shapes. Some may be darker than others, but within individual shadows there should be a minimum of contrast and texture. Use the side of your charcoal pencil to create these shadow shapes, rather than scribbling in lines.
Transition from shadows to highlights with halftones. Here, create gradations of contrast with darks from the shadow side and lights from the highlights.
Your highlights may have some texture, depending on the material. There may also be areas without any texture., Hold a charcoal pencil like a brush. Use the length of the charcoal to produce thin lines, and the side for softer, thicker lines. You can also transition the line from thick to thin to produce a taper (great for lines moving between shadows and highlights)., If you are drawing from life, walk around the model or object and observe it from all angles.
 If you're having a hard time conveying light and shade properly, make a basic model of your subject with moulding clay. It needn't be perfect: the point is to help you see how light bounces off the shape, creating highlights and shadows., Negative space is all the space between objects. Looking at negative space can be very helpful in understanding volume, as well as for measuring distances between things.


As an exercise, you can draw negative space only (rather than the object). This is particularly effective when working with a heavier medium like charcoal., This is a trick you can use to make your picture "pop": it brings out strong contrast and drop shadows, which often give the illusion of reality.

, Both the Firefox and Internet Explorer along with Google Chrome contain toolbar extensions for which you can use to review websites in your browser to submit to StumbleUpon.
 Provide your login information in the dialog box that is displayed. Make sure the checkbox labeled "Sign-out when I close the browser" is not checked, as it will save you time later on, if you should ever want to submit other new links to their database with known URL's. For StumbleUpon, it's best to try to stay logged in all the time, so you can submit new sites that aren't in the StumbleUpon database whenever you stumble upon a good one.
 Once you are logged in to the toolbar, you will see several buttons. One button in particular, advances you from page to page. This button is known as the "Stumble" button. Please take visual note of the location of this button now.
 If you are on the Chrome extension, you'll need to submit the page as a new bookmark from their website and skip over the next step (open up your Chrome web browser to your StumbleUpon account, click your personal icon from the top right corner of the black toolbar on the web page, click Add a page).

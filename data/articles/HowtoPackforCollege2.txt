 Moreover, few colleges have personal bathrooms; on the whole, expect to share and be prepared to make it more bearable by having the right gear. As well as a shower tote, the following items are considered must-haves:

Bathrobe. You will likely have to walk a distance to the shower, often in areas like hallways. Bathrobes provide modesty, especially in co-ed dorms. Try to pick easy-to-pack robes in fabrics like flannel rather than bulky, fluffy robes in terrycloth.






Bath towels; bring at least three bath towels so you can wash one while you use the other, leaving an extra just-in-case or as a swim towel






A washcloth or shower pouf.






Shower shoes; rubber flip-flops work well; the floors of community showers can be really filthy, and walking barefoot on one is a certain way to get a fungal infection.






Suction hooks to hang your gear and clothes from––or, get portable, folding over-the-door hooks






Toothbrush case and teeth cleaning items like dental floss, toothbrushes, toothpaste, etc.






Soap case; keep your soap in a case; liquid shower gel is a nice alternative to bar soap, and it's easier to keep intact






Bar or shower soap, shampoo, conditioner, and any other shower items you use






Other toiletries you consider essential, such as sanitary ware, aftershave, deodorant, etc.
 This is just in case one gets dirty. If you like to read on your bed, a bolster or U-shaped cushion might be an added help to keep you propped up without causing back or neck strain.

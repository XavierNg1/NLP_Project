Avoid using a chemical fertilizer as this could result in burnt sod. An organic fertilizer, such as Milorganite or Ironite, is recommended.






Spread the fertilizer by hand and rake into the sod, or use a seed spreader to apply the fertilizer.






Continue to use fertilizer once per month.


Cease watering the sod for 1 day and apply a fungicide to the sod at the first signs of disease.






Choose a granular or spray fungicide sold at any gardening center. Granules can be spread by hand or seed spreader. In severe cases of fungicide, a lawn care company with commercial products might need to be utilized.



Water twice a day for the first 3 days, then once a day for the next week to 10 days if sod is installed in hot weather (over 80 degrees F or 26 degrees C). After that, water every other day for a week, then every third day for the next week.
Change the watering schedule to twice a day for the first 2 days, then once a day for 4 days if sod is installed in cooler weather (under 80 degrees F or 26 degrees C). After the first week, water every other day in Week Two, every third day in Week Three, and once every 4 days in Week Four.
Adjust amount of water applied during the above cycles. In the beginning, apply 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of water. As application times decrease, soak the sod with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water during each watering period.
Check that the water is saturating the ground beneath the sod.
 Mow for the first time two weeks after installation and if sod is about 4 inches (10.2 cm) or higher.

Do not cut more than 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) during each mowing.






Keep the grass at about 2 inches (5.1 cm) high.

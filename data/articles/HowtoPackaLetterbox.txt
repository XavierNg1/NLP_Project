 The spot should be discreet and your box should not be visible or you run the risk of it being mistaken for trash or catch the eye of a curious vandal.;
, You may also want a box to include a pen, pencil, special ink-pads or even a "hitchhiker".
 You may want to double bag the journal/logbook. Quart size works well.
 A lousy hand carved stamp is better than a purchased stamp, but if you aren't an artist, consider purchasing a stamp that represents your hiding place well or have one custom made.
 Or you can be creative and make a unique journal, index cards, cash register receipt scrolls or you can make a custom journal to fit your letterbox.
, Do this in case someone accidentally finds your box and wants to learn more. An example label:


DO NOT REMOVE! -- DO NOT REMOVE! -- This is a letterbox -- “PEACE PILGRIM” -- Please sign our journal if you like, but replace everything just as you found it. -- For more info about this game: www.letterboxing.org / your email/ Letterbox Number.
 Try using nail polish or permanent marker.

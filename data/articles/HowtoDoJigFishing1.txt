 For jig fishing, purchase a heavy action or extra-heavy action rod. A stronger rod will handle large fish better and hold up if your line gets caught in the heavy cover (e.g. seaweed) that they often hide in. Shop for a fishing rod at your local sporting goods store to properly gauge the feel and sturdiness of different models. , Purchase a heavy braided fishing line of 50 pounds or more for jig fishing to avoid breaking. Heavier lines will not stretch, allowing you to pull in bigger fish more efficiently. A sturdier line will also stand up to thick cover like heavy vegetation and be easier to free if it gets stuck., If possible, try to use jigs that resemble the prey of the fish you are trying to catch (e.g. smaller fish local to the body of water). Jigs come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. To start, buy an assortment of jigs to experiment with, and to use in different water temperatures and with different types of cover.

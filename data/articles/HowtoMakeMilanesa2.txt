 Here's what you'll need to make Uruguayan Milanesa:


A cut of beef, chicken, or fish of no more than 1/2" (1.25 cm) thick
2 eggs
3 cups breadcrumbs
Garlic and salt to taste

, Beat your eggs lightly until a uniform liquid. Add your chopped garlic (in pieces as small as possible) and salt. If you like a garlic-y, salty, dish, go nuts. For salt, a starting point is a teaspoon (5 g).
 First with the egg mixture and then with the breadcrumbs. Make sure the crumbs surround the steak evenly. If they're not sticking on certain places, baste on more of your egg mixture, then add on more breadcrumbs.
 With cooking or olive oil, fry your steak on med-low heat until it shows a golden color. This will take 6-10 minutes.


If the stove isn't your thing, place it in the oven on LOW bake and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Bake until melted.
 In addition to a garnish of mozzarella, serve it with white rice. Fries, salad, mashed potatoes and vegetables are good, too. You could also top with a lemon or lime wedge.

 If you don't read books, you're really going to suffer a downfall. Fiction is not a problem- as long as it's up to your level. The Percy Jackson series are recommended for middle school students, and Paulo Coelho for 6th Grade- 12th grade students. Notice the descriptions carefully and try to make your writings better.;
, Comprehension books help you to analyse the information and think logically and help you for the unseen comprehensions in your examinations. Try doing ones higher than your level. It might seem tough at first, but you'll get the hang of it.
 Use the dictionary to learn new words or an electronic dictionary if you can't afford to turn the pages so much or cope with the small handwriting. An electronic dictionary has synonyms and antonyms or a thesaurus included in it, so it's a great deal. Not to mention it corrects your spellings if you enter the word whose meaning you don't know wrong.
 You can never become good at English without the passion to succeed. Have fun while learning new words and think of it as entertainment. Even if it's not the subject you'd give the best preference, you should still try to develop a passion at the very least.
 Observe what made you read till the very end, and use it in your writing.
 Write random jokes, stories and articles, or even pictures with wordings you like or collect them and keep them together in a single place. Be constant in your writings and make sure that you don't run out of writing instruments.

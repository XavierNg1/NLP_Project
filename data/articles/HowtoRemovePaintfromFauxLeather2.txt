 Since the paint has already dried on the faux leather, you will need to find a sharp knife or pin to remove it with. Gently scratch at the surface of the paint with the tip of the knife or pin. Be careful you do not scrape or puncture the faux leather.
 If you cannot easily remove the dried paint using the tip of a knife or pin, try a toothbrush. Use the toothbrush to make gentle circular strokes, so that the dried paint begins peeling off the faux leather.


Do not apply too much pressure or you might scratch the surface of the faux leather.
 Mix 1 quart/950mL water with 1 ounce/30mL dish detergent. Dip a sponge or soft cloth in the cleaning solution. Wipe the affected area down with the hot soapy water. This should help remove any remaining flecks of dried paint.For tough stains, dip the toothbrush in the cleaning solution and scrub the stain.
 Once you have removed the dried paint from the faux leather, dry the affected area with a cloth made of microfiber or cotton. You can also use a paper towel to dry the faux leather.
 If you have a tough stain on faux leather that doesn't respond to hot, soapy water or scrubbing, you might need a special cleaner. Look for cleaners that are specifically formulated for faux leather, and use the cleaner according to the manufacturer's instructions. You can use these cleaners on wet or dry paint.

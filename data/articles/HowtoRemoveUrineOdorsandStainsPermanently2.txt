 Outline the ones that cannot be seen with the naked eye with chalk to ensure that you don't miss anything.
 Do not use hot water or any sort of steam treatment. The heat will cause the proteins in the urine to bind to your carpet, rendering them almost impossible to remove. If you do not own a wet vac, you can rent one at a place like Home Depot.
 Hydrogen peroxide and baking soda are both famed detergents. Mix together with a few drops of dish detergent and you're ready to go. Pour into a spray bottle, spray on, and work into the urine stain with a brush or sponge. Let set for 10 or 20 minutes and inspect the site. To create the hydrogen peroxide solution, mix into a spray bottle:









8 fl oz peroxide
3 Tbsp baking soda
2-3 drops any dish detergent, This should be used in the same way as it would be for wet stains.
 If stains are your real problem, try priming the area (be it carpet or clothing) with a little bit of cool ammonia water first. For each cup of cold water, mix in 2 tablespoons of ammonia.Using a spray bottle, spritz the area until it is fully covered. Hit the area with a brush scrubber. Wait at least 45 minutes before attacking with the hydrogen peroxide cleaning solution above.
 There are a number of shampoos meant specifically for removing pet stains. Be sure that you hit the area thoroughly, and that when done, you've gotten all the shampoo out of the carpet.
 You should be finished with cleaning. Your stain should be gone and your odor eliminated.

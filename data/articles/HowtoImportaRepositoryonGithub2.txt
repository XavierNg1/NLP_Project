Fill in the bracketed information with your own pertinent information., This command should say "cd *.git*", followed by "git push --mirror https://github.com//.git" on a separate line. Exclude the quotation marks and brackets, and fill in the bracketed information with your own pertinent information., This command should say "cd ..", followed by "rm -rf .git" on a separate line.

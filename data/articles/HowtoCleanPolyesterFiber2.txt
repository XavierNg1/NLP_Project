 Follow the instructions closely to avoid damaging your mattress pad. Pay attention to the recommended cycle (regular or gentle) and which fabrics you can wash the pad with. For example, if your mattress pad is white and the tag specifies “like colors,” avoid throwing dark or dyed materials into the washing machine with it., Spray the product directly on any stains you find. Commercial pre-treaters are usually safe to use. You should only avoid them if the tag warns against them., Always default to cold water, even if the tag doesn't specify a temperature or allows hot water. Cold water will prevent shrinkage and decrease wear over time. Any kind of laundry detergent is acceptable. Avoid using bleach, which can damage the material., Low heat will prevent shrinkage of the material or stretching of the elastic. Add two dryer balls (available in most big box stores) if the pad is larger than twin size. If you don't have dryer balls, use two tennis balls. This will prevent the pad from twisting into a ball shape and allow it to dry more thoroughly., Hang it on a clothesline or lay it on a clean flat outdoor surface. Place it in direct sunlight for the quickest drying time. If the weather isn't cooperating, air dry the mattress on a drying rack or clothes hanger in the warmest location in your home. Make sure both sides are dry before putting it back on your bed.

 If you need help that cannot be provided through the 2-1-1 service or your local United Way branch, or if you live outside of the United States and Canada, contact United Way worldwide through the online contact form.


That contact form can be found here: http://apps.liveunited.org/contact/

You will need to provide your first name, last name, and e-mail address.
When applicable, you can also include the name of a company or organization you represent.
Including your zip code is optional but not necessary. If you include it, though, the United Way will be able to direct you to a local branch that can serve your needs better.
After filling out the necessary information and typing your question or comment in the indicated box, click on the "Submit" button to send your request.
 You can contact the United Way headquarters by calling: 703-836-7112


Follow any phone prompts you encounter until you reach an operator who can help you with your specific request.
Once you reach an actual operator, be prepared to answer questions about your request. You might need to provide information about your location so that the operator can direct you to a local branch that can help better.
 Many organizations and agencies partner with the United Way on local, state, and national levels. If you already know of a United Way partner you wish to contact for help, you can contact that partner directly without going through the United Way first.One such partnership is FamilyWize, a community partnership aimed at reducing the cost of medicine for children, families, and individuals who do not have prescription drug coverage. You can apply for a free FamilyWize card based on need and use it for prescription medications.Contact FamilyWize by phone at: 800-222-2818

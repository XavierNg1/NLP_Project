, The lower the grit number, the rougher the wood will be, the more stain will absorb into the wood and the darker your project piece will be. (And that's on the first application). The opposite is true as well. The higher the grit number, the smoother the wood will be, the less will absorb into the wood and the results are a lighter stained project piece.
 Next use a higher grit number (100 or 120). Keep in mind what depth of stain you are looking for in your finished piece. If you want a finished (med.) depth of stain, stop with the 100 or 120 grit. If you want it lighter, go with a higher grit number.
 Experiment on a scrap piece of wood to see what is right for you.

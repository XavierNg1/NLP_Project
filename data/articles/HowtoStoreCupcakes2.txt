 Place both frosted and unfrosted cupcakes in airtight containers.Avoid stacking the cupcakes. Space them apart with enough room for you to reach in and remove them later.
Use tall containers for frosted cupcakes to avoid upsetting the frosting.
Do not wrap unfrosted cupcakes in plastic wrap. When storing them at room temperature, moisture can build up in between the wrap and the top of the cake. As a result, the tops will be sticky and difficult to frost later on.;
, Instead of leaving the cupcakes on your countertop, place the sealed containers in your pantry or in another covered location free of sunlight.


During the hot and humid summer months, you may also need to find a relatively cool area, like a basement pantry.
Humidity and sunlight can heat up the container and the cupcakes, causing the cakes to "sweat" moisture and become sticky or soggy around the edges., Place the cupcakes in your chosen location and use within one or two days. After that time, the cupcakes will start turning stale.


Note that cupcakes decorated with fresh fruit should be consumed within one day when stored at room temperature.

 At harvest time, get two boxes labelled "Mild" and "Hot".
, Put the chillies in the compartments corresponding to the labels.
 Or, rent or buy an existing one. Canvas tent stalls are perfectly fine â€“ the needs depend on how hot, wet or cold your market gets.

 Have some lists they can take home, with a contact number, email address, and website address if you have one, for future and postal sales.

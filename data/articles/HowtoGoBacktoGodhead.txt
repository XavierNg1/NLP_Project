Chanting can be done congregationally or individually. The idea is to chant as much, and as regularly, as possible.
Individual chanting on prayer beads is recommended; 108 sequences of the mantra compose a full cycle on the prayer beads. Each cycle represents one round. Gradually increasing chanting to 16 rounds daily is considered the necessary minimum standard to progress towards bhakti (spontaneous devotion). It takes about 2.5-3.0 hours to chant 16 rounds, at a pace demonstrated by Prabhupad, about 11:30 minutes per round. You can find a sample at prabhupada.
Any number of rounds is beneficial.
 It is best to be attentive and respectful while chanting. Avoiding offences is an important consideration.
 Morning hours are considered especially beneficial and are particularly recommended. For example, daily chanting of the Maha-mantra, from 5 am to 7 am, out loud, on beads, can nicely become part of one's daily routine.

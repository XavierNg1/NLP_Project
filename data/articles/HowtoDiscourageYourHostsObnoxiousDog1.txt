 Many dogs like to jump on their owners and their owners’ guests when they enter the front door. When you see your host’s dog making its way toward you, immediately give the dog your back. By giving the dog your back, you are signaling that you do not tolerate this type of behavior., When your back is turned, cross your arms, as well. This prevents the dog from making any contact with you. If not, the dog will try to lick or mouth at your hands to get attention.Remember that any kind of contact can be perceived as attention.
 While your back is turned and your arms are crossed, stand still like a statue. This way, you can avoid sending signals through your body language that encourages the dog to interact with you.Try to avoid pushing the dog off of you. Instead, stand still until the dog leaves you alone.
 If you are standing with your back turned and your arms crossed, but the dog comes around to see you, simply turn around again. Make sure you are facing away from the dog when you turn, and do not make any eye contact. Keep turning until the dog becomes disinterested and leaves you alone.Do not be tempted to look at the dog and tell it “No.”

, When the dog is walking or running toward you, do not put your knee up to prevent it from jumping on you. You might inadvertently harm the dog if you use the knee-to-the-chest method, especially if the dog is running toward you.Plus, this method is not very effective because the dog will either try even harder to appease you, or become fearful or aggressive, if hurt.

This will allow you and your friend to have closure to move past the ending friendship.If you are ending the friendship because your friend has offended you in a way that you cannot forgive, tell them what they did as calmly as possible. For example, you could say “I know we have been friends for a long time, but your comments about the way I parent crossed the line. I think it is best that we go our separate ways.”

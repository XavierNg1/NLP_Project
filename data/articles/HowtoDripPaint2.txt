 Inexpensive watercolor sets can be found at general stores and art supply stores. To prepare the paint, add water to it. Many watercolors come in containers, so all you need to do is dip your brush in water and dampen the paint., Set the paper upright to take advantage of gravity. You can use a slanted workstation or an easel. You may also hold the paper up after youâ€™ve applied the paint. Watercolor paper, a rough paper like cardstock, or a watercolor canvas works best here since these options absorb paint evenly.Remember to place more paper or other material beneath the paper to catch paint runoff.
 Color your brush with the paint. Dab the paint onto the spot above where you want drips. The key to dripping is to add more paint to that spot. Continue adding paint until it begins to drip. More paint will lead to a longer drip line.Another way to do this to use an object like an eyedropper to pick up the paint. It can pile up a lot of paint in a single area., Clean off your brush in water. Take the wet brush to the paper and use it to make a drip line. Dab the brush in a little paint, then touch it to the top of the water line. The paint will quickly run downwards and fill the line. Water is useful for guiding the paint and creating precise drip marks., When you are finished, lay the paper flat so the paint can dry without dripping. When the paint is wet, it can drip into other wet paint. Watercolor dries quickly, but you can still combine wet colors to create unique effects.

 Outlook is Microsoft's current free email client which, in 2013, replaced Hotmail, Microsoft's older email service.Here, you have the option to sign into an existing account or to create a new account, which we will do.
 Below the login boxes, you should see a sentence that says "Don't have a Microsoft account? Sign up now." Click the "Sign up now" link to proceed to the account creation page.
 On the next page, you will be asked to enter your name, location, birthdate, and gender. You'll also need to decide on a username, which will serve as your email address when followed by "@outlook.com," and a password. Your password must be at least eight characters long and is case-sensitive.


You must also enter either your phone number or an alternate email address, which are used to help recover your username or password in the event that you forget either.
 When your account information has been completely filled out, you'll need to verify that you are a human being and not a computer program. Scroll down until you see a string of distorted letters and numbers. Enter this into the text box below. Because computer programs have a very difficult time completing this simple task, by doing this, you confirm that you are indeed human.
 This completes the account creation process! You'll be brought to your new Outlook account, where you are free to read and write new emails.


Don't forget to un-check the "Send me promotional offers from Microsoft" box before clicking "Create account" if you're not interested in receiving email advertisements!

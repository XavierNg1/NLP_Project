, This step is going to make your fingers hurt. (Sorry!) Basically, once you get the torsion spring in place, you use one or two fingers to push the top part of the spring all the way around to the spring's catch. It hurts like hell, but that strong tension is what keeps your Emtek lever or knob from sagging. Look at the pictures to see someone else's fingers suffer through the process. If the torsion spring or keyed washer didn't look broken, it's possible that the Emtek spring just slipped off its mount. If that's the case, make sure that you put the spring on correctly in this step.
 After placing the Emtek torsion spring back into place, you need to set the washer that goes on top of it. This washer keeps the spring in place and gives the top clip something to press down on.
 This is the piece that holds the washer, torsion spring, and keyed washer together. You can start sliding this in with your fingers, but eventually you will probably need a screwdriver to get it tightly in place.
 Put the spring on the turn post and hold it in place with one finger. You will need to hold it in place until you use the Allen Wrench to tighten the lever.
 To put the Emtek lever or knob back together, tighten the bolt with an Allen wrench. At this point you should be able to tell if the new parts fixed the lever. If it feels stiffer than before, you've fixed it. No need to buy a new Emtek lever!

, If your lever is stiff, place it back on the door the same way you took it off. If this guide didn't fix your Emtek door hardware, be sure to call Emtek!

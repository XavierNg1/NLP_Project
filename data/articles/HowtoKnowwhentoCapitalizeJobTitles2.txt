 When the job title refers to a profession or class of jobs rather than to a specific or official title, do not put it in uppercase.For instance, “Janice Buckley is a microbiologist,” or “Here are some tips from painter John Green.” In both cases, these job titles are being used to describe a profession rather than an official title, so they shouldn’t be capitalized.
 If a title is isolated from any names and used as a standalone noun in a sentence, it should not be capitalized. This is the most common use-case for job titles, which means that they most often don't require uppercase.For example, “John, who is a salesperson, works at the dealership,” or “The clerk helped us with the documents.”

, This is true whether or not the title is specific or general, official or unofficial.For example: “John Smith, editor in chief at Grammar Central, hates typos,” or “Helena Briggs, social worker with the NHS, is a handling the case.”

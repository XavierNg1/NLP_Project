 Use a comb or brush to remove any knots or tangles in your hair. The topknot style does not use a part, so you can choose to brush your hair straight back for a smooth look, or use your hands to pull your hair back for a messier appearance.
 Gather all of your hair starting at the front and then working your way towards the back, into a handful on the top of your head. Make sure that there are no loose strands and that all your hair has been gathered into your handful.
 Take the entire handful of hair and twist it in the same direction, creating a rope-like piece. Then, wrap it onto itself to create a knot-like spiral.
 Wrap a ponytail around the topknot you have created, making sure that the elastic doesn’t get caught on strands in the middle or top of the bun, but lays flat against you head at the base of the bun.


Pull out strands of hair to give it a messy appearance, or leave it as-is.
If you have very long hair, your knot might be a little too ‘vertical’ for you. In this case, you can lean it to one side and pin it. Otherwise, allow the knot to stand upright.
 Because this style sits on the top of your head, you may have hairs at the nape of your neck that didn’t manage to be include in the look. Pin these into your hair with a clip, and then give your entire head a quick misting of hairspray. Add any hair accessories you may want.

, Continue the cut all the way to the throat.
, The cut will be toward the head. Continue the cut so the head can be removed.
,,,, Take your knife and insert it behind the ribs along the base of the backbone. Gently work the knife toward the other end of the ribs (toward the outside). Make sure you cut as close to the ribs as possible so you salvage as much meat as you can. You should be able to see the blade of your knife at all times as you go through this process. Work your way all the way down as far as the ribs go.
 Continue this careful nature as you cut all the way back to the tail.
 Again, when you get to the tail at the bottom, keep your knife as tight to it as you can.
 You need to do this the entire length of both sides of the fish. You will know you are doing it right if you the sound of the small pin bones being cut can be heard. If you hear this, you are on the right track!

, Right now you should have 2 fillets lying on the table on either side of the middle column. If you have cutters available to remove the center from the rest of the fish, that works great. Often you can break the center piece off with your hands.
 Gently run the tip of your knife along the fillet to locate them. You can get rid of these bones by cutting out the part of the fillet where they are present. Another trick is to use some pliers to grab and pull them out. The good news is, there is not an abundance of them. You can still cook and enjoy trout even with these small pin bones present. In fact, on small trout, these small bones can be eaten as they become soft and barely noticeable.

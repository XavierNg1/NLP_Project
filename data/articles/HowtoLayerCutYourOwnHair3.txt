 It's easiest to turn your head upside down and use a comb to help you gather it. Use an elastic band to secure the ponytail at the top of your head.









The ponytail should be on the top of your scalp, not the crown of your head. This ensures the layers will be positioned correctly.
Make sure it isn't cocked to one side, since this could result in uneven layers.
 If you want short layers, stop sliding the elastic several inches from the tip of your hair. For longer layers, slide it down until it's about one inch from the end of the ponytail.









Alternatively, slide your fingers down instead of the elastic. This method may be more beneficial to those with longer hair.
 Use the scissors to chop off the section that's sticking out from the ponytail.









If you have thick hair, it may take more than one snip to get through all of the layers. Make sure you cut them all in the exact same place.
Don't cut at an angle, or the layers will look jagged. Make sure you hold the scissors horizontally and cut straight across.
 You will have even, natural-looking layers around your head. Trim individual pieces if you want to alter your look.

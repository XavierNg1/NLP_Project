 When working in your garden, wear gloves. Gardening gloves are readily available at most home improvement stores. When you’ve finished gardening, wash your hands thoroughly. This will prevent transfer of the parasitic larvae to your mouth and other surfaces within your home.
 Keep your crops in raised box beds and off the ground. Incorporate compost and organic matter into your garden to prevent the cool, moist conditions that slugs and snails thrive in. Place copper strips along the edge of your garden boxes, or install a low copper fence around the edge of your ground-level garden.


Other barriers you could surround your garden with to prevent snails and slugs include coffee grounds, diatomaceous earth, and sand.If you’re really desperate to keep slugs and snails out, bait and traps are available at most gardening or home improvement stores.
 Prevent the spread of the parasite by setting up mouse traps to kill rodents in or near your home. Place them against walls both inside and outside your home, and check them frequently. When you catch a rat, use disposable gloves to put it in the garbage.


Do not use rat poison if you have small children or other pets in your home.

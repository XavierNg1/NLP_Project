 Cut the fabric to its desired shape and size, Be sure to have it big enough to be able to place your MP3/ iPod inside.;
, Be sure to place the part you want on the outside on your end product facing the inside when you first sew it together because you will later be flipping it inside out. Sew along the edges of the pillow, BE SURE TO SEW ONLY 3 SIDES LEAVING ONE SIDE OPEN. Be sure you stitches are strong so you won't run into tearing or ripping issues later on.
 that are roughly 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) bigger than your MP3 or iPod. This will serve as its pouch.
 Sew along the edges of the smaller sheets and then be sure to LEAVE ONE SIDE OPEN so sew 3 sides and not all 4.
 Be sure that your MP3 or iPod fits in the smaller pouch comfortably.
 Sew a button on the inside of your smaller pouch (look at other buttons to see examples of how to sew it on) cut a small hole that will fit the button on the other side and make sure your MP3 or iPod can fit in the pouch with the button on there.
 Before attaching the smaller pouch to the big pouch flip the big pouch inside out (so the nice side is facing out)

, Stuff the big pouch of your pillow and make sure you don't over stuff it and provide problems later on but don't under stuff it so its uncomfortable.
 Attach the smaller pouch to the large pouch by opening the small pouch in the big pouch like a mouth and then sewing it around in a circle so you don't sew our pouch shut. (make sure the button side is exposed to the outside.)

, Lastly sew all of the access fabric closed on the 4th side BUT BE SURE NOT TO SEW THE SMALLER POUCH SHUT.
 To use this pillow simply place the iPod or MP3 inside the pouch and close the button to prevent it from falling out and getting lost in the night, or during a pillow fight! You can easily remove it for charging or just to take it out. Place headphones in for calmer listening or take them out to hear your pillow from anywhere!

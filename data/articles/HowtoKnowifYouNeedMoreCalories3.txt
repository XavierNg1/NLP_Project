 Instead of just three meals a day, eat snacks between meals.Try to eat as often as possible until your caloric intake or weight rises to the point where you want it. Tasty snacks that might help you consume more calories include:


Baked sweet potato fries
Crunchy carrots with hummus
Apple slices with caramel dip
Rice cakes

, Snacks like trail mix (nuts, raisins, granola, and chocolate nibs), dried fruit, and starchy vegetables like potatoes will help you boost your daily calorie count.There are lots of high-calorie snacks out there that are not healthy. Cheesy snacks, potato chips, and processed pastries are loaded with calories but not much else. Instead, stick to healthy high-calorie snacks, which also provide essential nutrients.
 Just serve yourself an extra helping of whatever your favorite part of the meal is. For instance, an additional scoop of mashed potatoes or an extra ladleful of soup will add more calories to your diet. Remember, every little bit counts.
 Quinoa is a healthy grain loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and protein. Just one cup (cooked) has 222 calories.Eat it the same way you would eat rice. Quinoa pairs well with steamed broccoli and cauliflower, and makes a good ingredient in tacos and burritos.
 Peanut butter has 100 calories per tablespoon, so if you’re trying to increase your calorie count, it’s the perfect choice.It works especially well on toast and cinnamon raisin bagels. And you can’t go wrong with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Try heating your peanut butter over the stove and mixing with a few tablespoons of water to create a savory Thai-inspired peanut sauce for rice and noodles.

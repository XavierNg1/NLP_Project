 Once you realize that important files have been deleted from your PC or media storage device it is imperative that you stop using that device. If you continue using the device, the deleted files could be overwritten and become harder to recover. This is especially true if files are saved to the drive or device you need to recover files from.
 As mentioned in step 1, do not download the software to the drive that you want to recover files from. There are two major types of data recovery software: free and not free. The importance of the files that you are trying to recover should dictate whether you pay for data recovery software or not. While free data recovery software can be used to recover files, software that you pay for will do a more thorough job of recovering files and may be able to retrieve files that the free software cannot recover.
, If you do not know what kind of file was deleted then do not select a particular type of file and let the program perform a search for all files.
 If you do not know where the file was stored then you can choose to have the entire PC scanned.
, The file should now be available for viewing.

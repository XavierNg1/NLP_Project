 There are a lot of ways you can try to read the signals, but the easiest thing to do is just be upfront with the girl. Ask her if she really likes you, and don't be afraid to say that you feel insecure about it sometimes. If you do this constantly it might get on her nerves, but there's nothing wrong with asking her. Don't accuse her, just say sometimes you worry.;
, It may seem counterintuitive to open up emotionally to someone you think might be playing games with you, but it could be the perfect solution. If you are sincere and she knows how you feel, she'll be more likely to answer honestly. If she is playing games with you, she may recognize that this isn't a joke to you.
 Don't be passive aggressive, just tell her that sometimes the way she acts hurts your feelings. No one is completely heartless â€” if she's playing games with you she may stop because she knows that it hurts you. Once again, don't get angry. Just let her know calmly that it makes you sad when she acts a certain way.

 As you're heating up the grill, cover the grate loosely with aluminum foil. The intense heat will cause any debris to break down and dissolve, starting the cleaning process for you. This also minimizes sticking. At its highest heat, this should only take about 10-15 minutes."Blasting the heat" is another way of saying very, very hot. We're talking around 550°F (288°C) here.So, obviously, cover your grill while this process is going on. The heat will sear the fish initially, sealing it. If you throw it on a warm grill, it'll stick.
If you're using a charcoal grill, those babies need to be gray, not black.;
, If you used aluminum foil for the previous step, remove it now. Using a stiff-wired grill brush, scrape the grate clean. Fold a couple of sheets of paper towels into a small square or pad. Grasping the paper towels with tongs, dip the paper towels in oil (vegetable or olive) and rub over the bars of the grate.


Continue to wipe the grate with the oiled paper towels until the grate is somewhat glossy. Plan on doing this about 5 times. It's a good idea to re-dip the paper towels in oil for each application.

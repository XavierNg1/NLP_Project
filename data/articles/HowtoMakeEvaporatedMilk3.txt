 Because these substitutions are not cooked, it doesn't have the light caramel flavor found in most evaporated milk. It does have about the same fat percentage and consistency, however, so it works well as a substitute in baked goods and other recipes where milk isn't at the forefront.
 To substitute 1 cup (240 mL) evaporated milk, mix ¾ cup (180 mL) milk and ¼ cup (60 mL) half-and-half.Use the same type of milk called for in the recipe. For example, if the recipe calls for full-fat evaporated milk, start with full-fat regular milk.


If the recipe does not specify a type of evaporated milk, assume it means full-fat.
 If you don't have both milk and half-and-half, you can scour your fridge for last-resort alternatives:


Half-and-half is close enough to work as a substitute. You can substitute buttermilk instead if a tart flavor is appropriate.Cream is an extra-rich substitute. You could try half water and half cream as a rough alternative, but only in cooked sauces or soups, not in desserts or baked goods.
Whole milk is a risky substitute, as it will not thicken sauces as well as evaporated milk.

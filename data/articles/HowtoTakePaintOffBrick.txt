 Don't cover an area larger than you can work on in 10 minutes - the paint remover will evaporate and you'll have to start all over again., Take off as much as you can a while the paint is still loose, and if there is still some paint left saturate the area again with the paint remover and repeat the above steps until all the paint is removed.,, Since brick is porous, there may still be an odor of paint remover left in the brick once you are finished. It should dissipate in a few days. If not, it can be neutralized by scrubbing the brick with a mixture of water and vinegar., You can usually tell by the age - if the brick is the newer than 40 years old, the chances are that it is actually stamped concrete, not clay brick. Concrete brick tends to be rougher looking and will have some visible aggregate in the brick, whereas a clay brick is solid in color. Concrete will be more porous than clay brick, which is baked in a kiln.

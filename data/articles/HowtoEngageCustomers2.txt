 Study the things that are important to your company and the people that buy your products. Focus on communicating company culture, rather than simply self-promoting, in all your customer communication.


For example, become a part of a local business organization or post information on your social media accounts that tout your city and state.
 For example, if you are a retailer of cowboy boots, perhaps it is a good idea to have a hashtag on Instagram that called #travelling boots so that your customers post pictures of themselves wearing their boots.
 Try sending a customer satisfaction survey or customer product input survey at least once per year. Send the survey out over Facebook and email.


Ask your customers to have a hand in buying new products or refining those you already carry.Send an email after someone has received their goods to see if they are satisfied.
One e-commerce site, ModCloth, asks customers to “Be the Stylist” and vote on their favorite outfits, so that ModCloth restocks the most popular items. You can also suggest other dresses that they don’t currently carry.
 Invite customers to celebrate with you when you open a new location, expand your hours or receive an award. They will want to know that they are supporting the best businesses out there.
 Build loyalty by offering timely discounts and incentives.
 Try to tailor your messages to each group. For example, a new customer would get different emails than a customer that has buying for years.
 Not only do comment sections and reviews help your website rank more highly in search results, but they create a forum for customer service.


Unless a comment is highly inflammatory, try to handle concerns publicly, so people can see your willingness to provide good customer service.
 Have a weekly drawing or customer of the week, so you can get customer perspective and participation.

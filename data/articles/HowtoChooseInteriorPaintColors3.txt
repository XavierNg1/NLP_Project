 Cool colors seem fresh and relaxing. Lighter shades seem fresh and clean, while darker shades can almost be therapeutic.
 Green is a color found most prominently in nature, allowing it to blend in easily with most rooms. Green walls tend to give off a calm, safe feeling, but green can also reflect light poorly and make your skin tone look unattractive, especially when green is used on the ceiling. Therefore, green may not make the best choice for bathrooms.
 Light shades have a cool, heavenly appearance, while dark hues make the ceiling look as though it is advancing, making dark shades more suitable for tall rooms.
 Violet is a regal and romantic color. It has less energy than red but more energy than blue. As a result, violet walls can give a room a sense of balance and harmony.

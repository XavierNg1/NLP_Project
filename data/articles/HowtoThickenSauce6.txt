 Don’t let it boil. This method works well with most sauces, because as a sauce heats up, the water will evaporate, leaving a thicker and more concentrated sauce behind.


Reducing a sauce will particularly concentrate sweet, sour, and salty flavors, but it may also boil off some of the herb and spice flavors, so taste the sauce as it reduces and be prepared to adjust the seasonings when it has fully reduced., As the water evaporates and the sauce reduces in quantity, it will continue thickening. Depending on what you’re making, your recipe may tell you to reduce the sauce to half, a third, or even a quarter of its original volume.
 If you aren’t working from a recipe, the rule of thumb is that a sauce is ready when it reaches nappé consistency, which basically means it will coat the back of a spoon without running off.

 Makeup really gives Nicole her look.



Eyeshadow. Nicole usually wears a black or gray colored eyeshadow. Just never wear any light eyeshadow colors, such as yellow, light blue or light green.






Lipgloss. Nicole's lips are a pale color. Use lip balm and pale pink or a color that matches your lip color, but one shade lighter.







Mascara and eyeliner. With mascara you don't need a lot. Snooki rarely ever puts on mascara, but you could put one layer. For eyeliner just use a reasonable amount. Not too much for people to notice from 5 feet (1.5Â m) away from you.

, Nicole's skin is not orange! It's a bronze color. Go to a tanning salon and get a tan. Or, you could just either get a bronzer or foundation because tanning kills your skin.


Avoid acne. Snooki has flawless skin. Try using Proactive or cover it with foundation.
 Snooki has a very fun and frilly personality. She also knows how to have fun and party. Just go crazy and be yourself. Don't be afraid to kiss girls and wear no underwear when you go to the clubs. She is also very emotional at times and doesn't enjoy when her friends/men (such as Pauly D) yell at her.
 Snooki can be outrageous but she's not a slut, she's just unique.


Club. When you go to the club, wear tight and short or medium length dresses with a cute little necklace and some hoop earrings.






At home, try wearing a plain black tee, some white shorts, and some big, fluffy sneaker-like slippers!







, Occasionally wear the "poof" on your head using a Bumpit hair accessory.

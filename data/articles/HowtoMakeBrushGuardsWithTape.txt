 Your brushes need to be free from the pigments and dirt before drying them and using the brush guards. Rub the brushes thoroughly in soap on the palm of your hand, and rinse in warm water in a sink. Then gently pat them dry with a paper towel.;
, Take a piece of tape and place the non-sticky side below a clean brush.
 The sticky ends would meet and seal. Make sure it is not too tight nor too loose, and it is the desired size.


To extend the length of the wrapping, simply add another piece of tape, overlapping the previous one.
 Slide it until the end of the tape extends a little more over at the tip. Half an inch is a good length.
 The tape should be towards the bottom with the handle up. By using this method, the water will run down towards the bottom of the container, and the extra tape at the tip will keep the germs away.
 Once dry, slide off the tape. Your brushes will be looking brand new!

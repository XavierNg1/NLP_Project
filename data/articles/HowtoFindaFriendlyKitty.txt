 There are friendly and grumpy cats of both ages however your perception will be influenced somewhat by your expectations. Some people will never find a kitten's playful antics to be 'friendly' when claws are involved. Also, a kitten's personality may change as it ages (especially post-puberty) whereas, with an adult cat, it's more a case of what you see is what you get.;
, Acquire as much information about the cats/kittens as possible - age, health, color, sex, temperament, history, etc

, Determine if you can reserve one, adopt one that day or must go through an application process., Ask to take them into a room with you that will allow you to interact with each animal individually.
 You should look for an inquisitive, out-going kitten who isn't scared of you. A kitten who plays with its siblings and isn't withdrawn.
 It is just that genetically, calico cats are almost always female. However, several vets have said that male gray cats tend to be the most laid back of all the cats.
 That should allow you to see closer to the real personality. Cats, like people, get nervous in new situations.
 Good owners/breeder should know their animals well and should have been interacting with them daily., Do not take a kitten from its mother before it is 8 weeks old. Kittens need that time for socialization with their mother and siblings.
 Talk to her/him when you come home and when you leave. Play daily. Talk to him/her when you feed them and anytime you walk by each other in the house. You wouldn't ignore another person so don't ignore kitty.

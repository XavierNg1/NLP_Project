 Navigate to the file or folder you want to delete and left-click on the name or icon once to select it. Note that this option is available through Gnome and other Linux platforms, but may not be available for all Linux platforms.
 Pressing Ctrl + Del on your keyboard will temporarily delete the file and send it to your Trash, where it can be reviewed before permanent deletion. This is usually the preferred option.
 Press and hold â‡§ Shift first before pressing Del. You will be asked to confirm your request, and upon confirmation, the file or folder selected will skip over the Trash and be permanently deleted from your computer.
 If you have deleted your files and folders the traditional way and they are waiting in your Trash for deletion, right-click the Trash icon in the sidebar and select the "Empty Trash" option that pops up.


Depending on your Linux platform, this may or may not permanently and securely wipe the files from your hard disk. If it does not, it will only delete the link or pathway allowing you to access that data without deleting the data itself.

 There are a variety of factors that could potentially be causing your speakers to sound distorted or fuzzy. Mismatched equipment is one of the most common factors. Check that the amplifier and receiver support the ohms that the speakers draw, and that the speakers can handle the wattage output of the amplifier. Check the documentation for all of your equipment to ensure that everything matches.
 If you've accidentally swapped the positive and negative wires on your speakers, you likely will not hear anything coming out of them. Double check all of your connections, and ensure that the black cables are inserted in black clips, while the red cables are inserted in the red clips.If the speaker is too far away and you aren't using a proper gauge wire, you can experience a lot of distortion. Try to move the speaker closer to the receiver and then shorten the wire, or run newer, lower-gauge wire.
Crossed wires can short out your speakers and cause serious damage. Make sure the black and red wires are not touching when bare at the ends.
 Check that the speakers are not physically damaged. A blown-out speaker can sound terrible, so ensure that the woofers on the speaker aren't torn. If you see any physical damage, try replacing the speaker.

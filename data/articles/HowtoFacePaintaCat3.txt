 Begin with white paint or white, creamy eye shadow. You will use this to create the white streak down Grumpy Cat’s face and around his eyes. Start in the center of the forehead. Paint a streak that is about an inch wide down your face until you reach the bridge of your nose. From there, it should get wider. The white paint should cover your nose, inner cheeks, jaw, and lips.








You can use a white lipstick for your lips instead of paint.
 Cover the rest of the face with a light brown paint or golden brown bronzer. Make sure it doesn’t run into or blend with the white paint. Since Grumpy Cat’s eyes are darker than the rest of the face, you can use a darker color or apply the paint or bronzer heavier around your eyes.
 You can use light pink paint or lip liner. It’s okay if you have covered your nose in white paint. The light pink paint or lip liner will cover the white paint. Cover the tip of the nose and nostrils with the paint. Bring the paint just below the nose to create a point, similar to a cat’s nose. You can mix the paint with a light brown at the point for a more realistic look.
 To emphasize the grumpiness, you can use light brown paint or eyeliner to draw on frown lines. Frown and follow the natural lines of your face. The lines shouldn’t be too thick or plentiful. Make sure to keep an unhappy look on your face so people will know what famous cat you’re trying to look like.

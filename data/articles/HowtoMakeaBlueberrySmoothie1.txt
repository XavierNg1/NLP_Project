 You can use any type of yogurt you want, but blueberry, plain, or vanilla will taste the best.;
, You can use fresh or frozen blueberries. If you use fresh blueberries, make sure that you rinse them in a strainer/colander under running water. If you are using frozen blueberries, just toss them in. You do not need to thaw them.
 If you'd like a thicker smoothie, leave the milk out., If you are using frozen blueberries, you won't need to add any ice. They will already give you the thickness you need., If you are using a flavored yogurt, such as blueberry or vanilla, you probably won't need to add the honey at all.
 From time to time, you may need to open up the blender, and push the mixture down the sides using a spatula. Don't worry if the smoothie looks "grainy." These are simply the blueberry skins. Most blenders will not be able to grind them up all the way.


If the smoothie is too thin, add some more ice. If the smoothie is too thick, add more milk.
 This will be enough for one large servings, or two smaller servings. If the smoothie is very thick, use a spatula to help "guide" it into the cups.

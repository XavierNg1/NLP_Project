 Before you do anything else, clean your house. Vacuum, dust, do whatever you have to do to get it sparkling clean. This will be the biggest factor in making a home look nice.;
, People buying a house want to maximize the amount of space they will have. It won’t matter how big your home is if it’s filled to the brim with clutter: it will look small and cramped. Make it easier for potential buyers to envision the space by removing as much clutter as possible.


Generally, a good rule of thumb is that if it has a home somewhere else: it’s clutter. The object should match with the function of the space that it is in and should need to be in that specific place. Piles of paper, boxes of items, clothing, old computers, and appliances are all examples of clutter.
 Buyers want a house which is bright and airy. Open curtains and replace them with sheers, if possible. Remove any obstructions, such as trees, bushes, or objects within the home that keep the light from pouring in.


Additionally, try to show the house during times of day when it is brightest in your home.
 You want a potential buyer to see the house as theirs, not yours. Remove personal items like family photographs, personal trophies, and other items which are specific to you and your family.

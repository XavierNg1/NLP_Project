 If the event involves two routines or passes from each gymnast, use the scores from the second routine when using the tiebreakers listed below.
 At these competition levels, go through each of these steps in order, until the tie is broken:


Add each gymnast's two highest execution scores together and compare the result.
If still tied, use the highest judge score for each gymnast, ignoring other judges.
If still tied (including if there is only one judge), the tie stands.
 At level 10, junior elite, or senior elite competitions, use this system instead:


Compare the highest total score.
If still tied, compare the highest execution score from a single judge.
If still tied, compare the highest difficult score.
 If two or more gymnasts are still tied, the tie stands and they both share a spot in the standings. Here's an example:


Two gymnasts tie for 2nd place.
The 1st place medal is awarded as usual.
The 2nd place medals are then presented to the tied gymnasts.
The next gymnast came in 4th, since there are three gymnasts ahead of her. No 3rd place medal is awarded for this event.

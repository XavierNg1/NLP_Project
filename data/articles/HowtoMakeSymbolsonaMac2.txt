 Click the text field where you would like to enter an emoji. This should work in most text fields, such as emails and text documents. If you want to make sure it works, try it in TextEdit.


If you want to keep the special characters window open as you type, click anywhere on your Desktop instead.
 Look at the bottom of the drop-down Edit menu for this option. Depending on your OS X version, this will be called Emoji & Symbols or Special Characters....You can also open this menu with the keyboard shortcut âŒ˜ Command + Control + Space.
 The special characters popup has several categories. Click the tabs at the bottom to switch between them. Click the arrows tab to scroll to more categories.


If you're having trouble finding something, scroll up in the special characters popup to reveal a search bar.
You can switch between this small view and a large view using the button in the top right corner. You may need to scroll up before this button appears.
 Double-click on a symbol to insert it into your text field. You can also drag-and-drop it into the field, or right-click, select Copy Character Info, then paste it into your text field.


On some older OS X versions, use the "Insert" button instead.
The next time you use this menu, recently used symbols will appear in the first tab for easy access.

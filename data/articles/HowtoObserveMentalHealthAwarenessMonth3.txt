 Mental Health First Aid training sessions are offered in many countries, and are available several times each year in some locations.


The sessions are available to community members, teachers, and health professionals alike.
 After registering for or receiving the initial training, consider encouraging others to attend the training or learning how to train others yourself.
 Once you have learned the first aid skills, do not be afraid to put them to use â€“ they may save the life or health of someone you love.

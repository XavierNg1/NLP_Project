 Inspect your cut to see if it is deep enough to require stitches, or if you can treat it at home. If the wound is gaping, jagged, or exposing muscle or fat, see a doctor as soon as possible. The cut should be stitched within a few hours to reduce the risk of infection or scarring., It is important to remember to wash your hands before touching your cut or scrape to avoid infection. Wet and lather your hands with an antibacterial soap, then scrub for twenty seconds and rinse. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer., Shallow cuts and scrapes will usually stop bleeding on their own. If bleeding persists, apply pressure to the wound with a clean cloth. If possible, elevate the wound to help stop the bleeding., Rinse the wound gently with clean, drinking-quality tap water. Wash the surrounding area with a gentle soap and water, avoiding the actual open wound, and pat it dry with a clean cloth or piece of gauze. Sterilize a pair of tweezers by cleaning them with alcohol, then use them to remove any dirt or debris that might be stuck to your cut.If dirt or debris remain in the cut, contact your doctor as soon as possible.
Avoid using hydrogen peroxide or iodine to clean the wound, as they can further damage the tissue around your wound and make it harder to heal.
 Shallow cuts or scrapes can heal on their own, but adding an antibiotic ointment can speed up the process. Purchase an ointment (such as Bacitracin ) at your local pharmacy. Apply a thin layer to your cut after cleaning and drying it thoroughly., Once the wound is dry, cover it with a bandage. Alternatively, cover the area with a small piece of gauze and attach the gauze to your skin with medical tape. The bandage should be changed whenever it gets wet or dirty, or if blood soaks through.The dressing can be removed after a few days, once the cut has closed itself.

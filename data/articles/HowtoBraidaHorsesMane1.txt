 If the horse's mane is dirty, wash it with horse shampoo. Do not use conditioner, which makes the mane slick and difficult to braid.
 If your horse's mane is thick, "pulling" it with a mane comb will make it much tidier and easier to handle. If the mane is already thin, you can instead trim it to an even length with a blade.Manes are typically cut to no longer than a hand (about 4 inches, or 10 cm), although this is less important for button braids.


Ideally, washing and pulling should be done at least a day before braiding.
 Tie your horse in a quiet area free from distractions. Encourage the horse to stand still with a hay net, unless your horse tends to move while eating.


Leave standing room to braid the mane on the right side of the horse, which is traditional for hunter and dressage competitions. For jumper competitions, you may braid the mane on whichever side it falls naturally., Before you begin, there are a few steps that can make the process easier:


Sweep hay and other ground cover away from the horse so you can find dropped objects, especially if you are using a needle.
Place a stool next to the horse if you cannot reach the horse's neck easily. Working with the mane at waist level might be easiest.
Put down a container for your tools, or wear an apron or overalls with a large pocket.
 Take a soft body brush, and dip it in water, egg white, or hair gel for horses, to keep the mane flat and easy to work with. Brush gently to remove all tangles.
 Continue on to any one of the sections below, or use these tips to decide which you want to try:


The band method makes easy, dangling braids, best for short manes.
The yarn method is harder, but makes sturdy, attractive looped braids.
Sewing creates small "button braids" often used in dressage. You'll need to use bands or yarn first before you can sew these on.
A running braid is quick and easy, but not suitable for competitions.

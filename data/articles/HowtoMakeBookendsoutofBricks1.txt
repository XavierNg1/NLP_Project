 A brick is pretty much a brick but there are some things to be wary of when choosing your bookend bricks. For example, be sure to use completely dry bricks before beginning the project. This might mean leaving the bricks to dry somewhere first if you've unearthed them from a wet outdoor location. Second, avoid bricks that you can't sit evenly. Bricks that have chunks of mortar stuck to them or that have missing corners that make them wobbly might not be suitable for the bookend, although by all means test their balance first and see if you can't knock off that mortar with a few well placed hammer knocks. And of course, ensure that the bricks are clean before proceeding––a cloth dipped in hot soapy water and rubbed over dirt and stains should help to remove the worst of any grime build-up. Be sure to use solid bricks not the ones with holes. They may not be heavy enough and will not give you a smooth surface.mor


It's recommended that you make the bricks in pairs each time, as clearly having one brick for each end of the bookshelf is helpful in most cases.

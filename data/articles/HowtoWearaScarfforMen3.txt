 Fold the scarf in half lengthwise so that it effectively becomes half its original length.Since this scarf style requires you to halve the length of your scarf, the best type of scarf to wear this with is a long rectangular scarf. The ends can either be rounded or fringed.
This style can be moderately warm to very warm depending on how tightly you tie it.
This type of knot has also been called the European Knot, European Loop, Loop Pull, and Slipknot.
 Hang the folded scarf off the back of your neck, bringing the loose ends and looped end across your chest.


The loose ends and looped end should hang straight down over your chest on opposite sides.
This draping effect should mimic the classic drape style, except for the fact that the scarf is folded in half.
 Stuff the loose ends through the loop and pull them through, tightening the loop into a knot around your neck.


The knot should be positioned in front of your neck.
Only the loose ends should hang down in front of your chest now.
 You can make the knot as loose or tight as you want.


A somewhat loose knot is generally more comfortable. It also creates a more casual, laid back style than a tighter knot would.
Straighten out any twists in the loose ends of the scarf so that the ends lie flat against your chest.
Note that you can wear the loose ends of the scarf over your jacket or tucked inside your jacket. The former is more fashion-conscious, while the latter is warmer.

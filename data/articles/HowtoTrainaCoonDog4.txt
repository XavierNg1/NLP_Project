 Desensitizing your dog to gunfire should take place in a secure area. Do not shoot a gun in an area that is populated with other people, and only use a firearm that you are legally registered to use. Your dog should be secured in a crate.
 You should be within a dozen feet of your dogâ€™s crate while you are shooting. Never shoot your gun into the air, always aim at a target.
 If they seems frightened, stand farther away from the crate and repeat the exercise. Say calm and encouraging words and reward them with a treat when the exercise is over.


The alternative to this process is to have someone else fire a gun at a distance while you give your puppy a treat or toy at the same time the shot is fired. During this process, they will associate the loud noise with something they like and will be less likely to be frightened by it.
 Over several days, repeat this process until your puppy is no longer startled by the noise. This may take a few weeks if your puppy continues to be startled by the noise. Some dogs are more skittish and bothered by gunfire than others. This process may take repetition over the following days, or weeks.

WARNING: Make sure burner is completely cool from any previous use.
Lift up on the burner. One side will lift while the other stays in place.
Gently pull on the side that has lifted up. Pull away from the side which is in place as if you are trying to unplug it.
The burner will come out, revealing two prongs on the burner and a socket that the prongs plug in to on the stove.
, If your meter reads a resistance, often between 10 and 50 ohms, your burner is good. If your meter shows no reading, there is no continuity and the burner needs replaced. New burners can be purchased at a hardware store or major retailer.
 You must insert the burner at an angle similar to how the old burner was removed., If it does not sit flush, pull it back up and make sure it is plugged in to the socket all the way., The stove should now be working properly.

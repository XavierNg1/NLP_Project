 Add 1 cup (267 g) of coarse sea salt to a glass jar or container. Pour in ½ cup (118 ml) of liquid coconut oil, and mix with a fork until the ingredients are fully combined.If you don’t have coconut oil, you can substitute olive oil.
 Once the salt and coconut oil are fully combined, mix in 5 to 7 drops of grapefruit essential oil. Stir the scrub well to distribute the fragrance throughout the mixture.You can use other citrus essential oils if you prefer, such as lemon, lime, or orange. However, grapefruit is particularly good for the scrub because it has antibacterial and antiseptic properties.
 You can use the scrub once or twice a week. Keep it beside your sink so it’s easy to remember to use it when your hands feel dry and rough.Be sure to store the scrub with a lid on to keep it airtight.

 The first step is to bring up the command prompt that is running the operating system.;
, On the keyboard push down and hold the Windows button, and at the same time push down the keyboard key R.This will bring up the run Windows for those who do not have Run under the Start Menu.
 Or click the Start Menu button and then select the Run command found on the Start Menu dialog box.
,, You will get a small box that has system information and has a black screen in the background of the Windows box. This is the command prompt where you can start to ping the network.
 After typing in the ping command you should get information about the Internet connection.
,


To check to see if the right ping is set type ping 127.0.0.1 (no periods after the one in the code), after this you should get a reply message from your computer. This means that the IP address is correct.






If that fails than you need to type these codes in to the Command prompt.






Type ipconfig /release (this releases the IP address), second type in ipconfig /renew (the computer knows the right address to assign to the computer by itself).

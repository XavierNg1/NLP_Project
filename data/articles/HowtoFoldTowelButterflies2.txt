 Place the towel on the bed or other surface where you want it to lay. Bring the two long ends of the bath towel together so that it’s folded crosswise. Then bunch the folded towel together crosswise in the middle. Fluff the “wings” with your hands.Use a colorful bath towel if you want a colorful butterfly! The bath towel will form the wings.
 Tuck the edge of the washcloth into the thick end to form the head. Lay the rolled washcloth on top of the bath towel, in the middle.No binding is necessary, as the towels are stacked loosely on top of each other so they can be readily used.
Due to size, the best place to lay your butterfly towel is on the guest’s bed. However, you may also lay it on a large desk, counter or armchair.
 Use your imagination to decorate the butterfly however you like. For example, take a bit of string and tie a knot on each end. Loop the string through the head of the butterfly (or simply lay it down underneath the head) for antennae. Use eye and mouth stickers, if desired.

 Mildew in your home is linked to respiratory problems and other health concerns. In addition to being ugly, it is important to remove it from your toilet for these reasons. In order to remove mildew, you can use the same products as you would for mold--white vinegar, bleach, or tea tree oil--but the procedure is a little different. To begin, select which product you want to use., Place the solution of your choice--bleach water, vinegar water, or water with 10-15 drops of tea tree oil--into a spray bottle. You can re-purpose an old spray bottle you have at home, or purchase a new one., Mildew loves water and thrives in damp environments (like your toilet). In order to clean it effectively, you need your toilet to be a little bit dry inside. So flush your toilet to start the cleaning process.
 While the inside of your toilet is empty (or as close to empty as possible), use your spray solution to coat the inside of your toilet bowl with your cleanser., As quickly as you can (before the toilet refills with water), vigorously scrub the mildew from the inside of your toilet bowl. You may need to repeat this process until all of the mildew is gone.

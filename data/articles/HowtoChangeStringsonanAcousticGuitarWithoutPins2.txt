 Pull the string until the ball end is fully seated.
 Pull the string all the way through the tuning peg until it is taut, then give it enough slack so that the string will be able to wrap about four times around the string post.
 The first wrap of the string should be above the loose end of the string.
 For the beginners it is best to use an electronic guitar tuner.
 Be careful not to cut the string too short or the string will come loose.

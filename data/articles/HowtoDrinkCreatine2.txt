 When you're loading creatine, 5 grams is the recommended dosage to start with; unless a doctor has recommended otherwise, 5 grams is a safe bet.


Use the plastic measuring cup that came with the powder to measure it out.
If your can of powder didn't come with a measuring tool, measure one heaping teaspoon, which is roughly equivalent to 5 grams.
 Pour the powder directly into the water and use a spoon to quickly stir it. If you're using a bottle with a cap, you can close the cap and shake it.


If you don't have a container that is exactly quart-sized, measure four cups of water into a large container and mix in the powder.
You may find it convenient to buy a quart-sized water bottle with a lid, which you can carry with you for times when you want to take a dose of creatine outside the house.
You can also mix creatine with juice or an electrolyte-containing energy drink.
 As mentioned above, creatine beings to degrade when it is mixed with water, so you must consume it right away to get the maximum benefit from the supplement.


Chase the creatine with more water. It's important to stay well hydrated while you take creatine, so follow it up with another cup or two.
Eat and drink as normal. There are no dietary contraindications for creatine, so you may eat a normal meal before or after consuming it.
 When you're loading creatine, you need a total of 20 grams a day for the first five days. Space out the doses so you have one at breakfast, one at lunch, one at dinner and one before bed.
 After the initial 5-day load, taper off to a comfortable maintenance routine. You can safely take up to 4 doses a day, but taking 2 or 3 has the same effect once you're in maintenance mode. Since creatine isn't cheap, you might want to cut back the dosage.

 Look for the game app on your device. Its name is Spider-Man with the classic Spider-Man on the logo. Tap on it to launch it.
 Check how many lives you currently have. The number of lives is displayed on the header beside the Spidey face. Each time you play, a life is consumed. A life gets replenished every 10 minutes, up to five lives.
 You can only buy a full set of lives. This means you can only buy when you don’t have any life left. When this happens, there will be a plus icon beside the Spidey face on the header. Tap on it, and a “Refill Your Spidey Energy” banner will appear.
 On this banner is a “Buy Refill” button. Tap on this. A refill of a full set of lives costs 3 ISO-8. You will now have a full set of five lives and can continue with playing the game.

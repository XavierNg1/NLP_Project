 Pearls are highly valuable and desirable enough to appear in just about any jeweler's stock. A chain store jeweler is a reliable source, but you may not always get the biggest selection or the lowest cost. You can buy from smaller, family-owned jewelers or only for a better selection and price, but you need to do your homework on these sources first. Check reviews, ask if the jeweler is certified by an official gemological organization, and make sure that there are no complaints filed against the company.;
, Most pearls are not naturally grown. Instead, they are harvested from oyster farms specifically created for the formation of pearls. Both types are considered organic, however.
 Luster refers to the way in which light reflects from the surface of the gem. To determine if a pearl has high quality luster, look at how well images are reflected in the surface. The clearer te reflection, the better the luster.
 As far as taste goes, whether you choose large or small pearls is a matter of personal preference. Larger pearls will generally cost more, though, simply because there is more pearl there.
 No two pearls are exactly alike, and each one will vary slightly in shape, color, and size. If the differences are too noticeable, the piece will look unbalanced. It is important to note, however, that a piece made from pearls with very few differences will be more expensive.

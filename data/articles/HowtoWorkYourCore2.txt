 Swiss balls (or stability balls) allow you to perform classic exercises while amplifying their effectiveness. While you’re likely well-accustomed to traditional sit-ups, incorporating a Swiss ball into this exercise will provide a better workout in less reps. To position yourself, sit upright on a Swiss ball, as though you’re sitting on a straight-back chair with the soles of your feet flat upon the ground in front of you.Swiss balls can be purchased at most stores that sell exercise goods. They are balls made of a soft elastic material, and vary in size. Choose a size based on your height.
Start doing six reps at a time, and repeat the exercise for three sets. Increase the number of reps per set as you are able to do so.
If you can easily do sit-ups on a Swiss ball, hold a weight plate across your chest while doing so to increase the level of challenge.
 Begin in a push-up position with the Swiss ball just beside your lower legs. Carefully lift one leg at a time onto the ball, supporting the weight of your body with your hands on the floor and the ball beneath your shins. Pull the ball forward along your shins by contracting your abdomen, and pulling your knees towards your chest, then allow the ball to roll backwards by slowing pushing your legs back out.Keep your hands directly beneath your shoulders.
Shoot for three sets of six reps each to start, increasing the number of reps as you’re able.
 If you can easily complete multiple reps with the ball beneath your shins, do the same thing with the ball beneath your toes instead. This will make it much harder to pull the ball forward and push it back, as well as increase the distance you are able to roll the ball. When the ball is beneath your toes, take care not to roll off of the ball.To add to the challenge even further, trying rolling the ball forward and backward while balancing on one foot. Don’t forget to do so with each leg.

 Rinse herb springs and/or flower petals in a sieve or colander under running water. Allow the sieve to drain. Spread the herbs out on paper towels. Blot them lightly.Some examples of edible flower petals are nasturtiums, violets, pansies, rose petals, violas, calendulas, dianthuses, marigolds, geraniums and daylilies.Some examples of herbs you may want to use are parsley, apple mint, tarragon, lemon thyme, fennel, lemon balm, marjoram and mint.
You can use the leaves or flowers for certain herbs, such as scented basils, bee balm, chamomile, chive, garlic, ginger, rosemary and lemon verbena., If the stems aren’t woody, you can chop the herbs with the stems included. Otherwise, separate the leaves and discard the stems. Chop enough herbs and flowers to firmly pack your measuring cups.For example, rosemary, thyme, tarragon, oregano and marjoram all have woody stems. Pinch the top of the stem with one hand. Strip the leaves with your other hand by running your fingers down the stem from top to bottom.Soft herbs like cilantro, parsley and chervil have tender stems. You can chop their stems along with the leaves., Brew tea using the herbs you’d like to include in your jelly. You can use any edible fresh, frozen or dried herb leaves and flowers, if desired. Some flavor combinations will blend well, and some won’t, so this is a good way to test the taste before committing to a jelly flavor., Choose water if you want the flavor of your herbs to stand alone. For example, you may want to use water for strong flavors like fennel or basil with cloves.To use wine or juice, select complimentary flavors.

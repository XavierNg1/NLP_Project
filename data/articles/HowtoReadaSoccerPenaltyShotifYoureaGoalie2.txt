 The general tendency of a kicker is to shoot the ball opposite the goalie. Knowing this tendency can help you more effectively anticipate where a kicker will shoot the ball.


One study showed that almost 70% of penalty kicks taken went to the side opposite the kicker's dominant foot: right-footed players kicked to their left and the keeper's right and vice versa.This mimics the natural swing of the foot across the body because it is difficult to shoot to the opposite corner using an instep kick.
If you can’t read the player or the ball, it’s best to assume that you should go right for a right-footed kicker and left for a left footer., Just as it’s important to pay attention to the other team’s players during the game, it’s also wise to study them before you meet them on the field. This will give you an idea of how they generally play and also highlight any playing patterns by individual players.


Watch videos of the other teams matches to acquaint yourself with their playing style.
If you are near your opposing team or cannot get a video of them playing, visit one of their games.
Studying the motions of a player on a computer can also improve your ability to read the movements a shooter makes because these give away clues about how they will play., Knowing how to anticipate any body’s movement is something that can help any goalkeeper defend shots on goal. By learning the principles of kinesiology, or the study of movement, you can become a much more effective goalie, especially against penalty kicks.


Most colleges offer courses in kinesiology, though you can also find online courses at places like the University of Utah or Sam Houston State University.

 One way to stay engaged in class is to sit near the front of the classroom. This also deters you from wanting to sleep because you are closer to the teacher. Being close helps you focus on the teacher’s lesson instead of daydreaming.Sitting closer to the front of the room can help you focus on the material instead of drifting off and not paying attention. You may see an improvement in your grade.
 Staying in the same position for an hour can make you feel drowsy. Move around discreetly so you can get a burst of energy but not disrupt class. For example, you can cross your legs, shift the position in your seat, or bend down to get a new pen from your bookbag.For some people, jiggling their foot or hand can help them stay awake.
If you cannot keep your eyes open anymore, you may ask for a bathroom pass just so you can get up and move around.
 There are certain ways you hold yourself that may make you want to fall asleep. This includes slumping back into your desk. Sit straighter so your body position is more alert.Don’t place your head in your hands. Leaning against your palm or propping your chin in your hand may make you want to fall asleep.
Never put your head down onto the desk. This will more than likely lead to falling asleep.

 However, they are still a great resource for information and can provide you with an entire range of services, which will make your trip run smoothly, as well as save you time, problems, and money.;
,


Things you will need:

Date, Place, and price range of your trip.
List of agencies in your near by area.
List of questions



, They will ask where youâ€™re going and why, how you would wish to travel, how long you plan to stay, and what your travel budget is. Be open and honest with your answers. A good agent will gladly put together a sample tours that describe availabilities in transportation, accommodations, and estimated costs.
 However, while an agent will typically ask questions to get this type of information from you (and you should take it as a bad sign if the agent does not), you will also need to do your part by speaking your mind.


Clarify the main purpose of your trip.
Decide where you want to go and when, making sure the trip will fit into everyone's plan.
Choose your mode of transportation, whether it's Airline, Cruise, rental car, or something else.
Try to determine a realistic budget for your trip based on all your other considerations.
 You should ask most of these questions to person, in addition, when you meet with those agents:


What kind of travel do you specialize in?
Can I contact you 24 hours a day?
Which services do you charge for and how much will they cost?

, As you start to discuss travel options with an agent you like, keep these guidelines in mind:


Do not rely on vocal agreements alone.
Do not suppose your accommodations will look as impressive as they do in the glossy direct mail.
Always read all the paperwork carefully before you sign it, especially when it comes to package deals.

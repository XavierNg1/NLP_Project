 Set up your two equations in standard format and look at the coefficients of each of your variables. You are looking for the circumstance where the numbers are the same but the signs are different.

Consider this example:


x−3y=5{\displaystyle x-3y=5}


2x+3y=19{\displaystyle 2x+3y=19}



By examination, you should see that the first equation contains the term −3y{\displaystyle -3y}, while the second equation contains the term 3y{\displaystyle 3y}. These two terms are opposites of each other.
 Working across the system from left to right, add each term of the first equation to the corresponding term of the second equation. It may be helpful simply to draw a long horizontal line across the bottom of the two equations and add downward, as you would with any ordinary addition problem.

The above example works out as follows:


x−3y=5{\displaystyle x-3y=5}


2x+3y=19{\displaystyle 2x+3y=19}

-------------------------


3x=24{\displaystyle 3x=24}




, Because you were adding, and one of your terms contained opposites, then one of the variables should be eliminated from the problem. Rewrite what you have left as a single equation.

In the example above, the y{\displaystyle y} variable was eliminated. The remaining equation is 3x=24{\displaystyle 3x=24}.

Because one of the variables gets eliminated in this method, as with the prior subtraction method, some textbooks will refer to this as the “elimination” method of solving a system of equations.
 What you have left should be a fairly simple, one-variable equation. Solve it by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient.

In the example above, divide both sides of 3x=24{\displaystyle 3x=24} by 3. You will be left with the solution x=8{\displaystyle x=8}.
 Take that solution, in our example x=8, and substitute it in place of x{\displaystyle x} in either one of the original equations.

Choose the first equation:


x−3y=5{\displaystyle x-3y=5}          (original equation)


8−3y=5{\displaystyle 8-3y=5}          (insert value of x)

-3y={\displaystyle 3y=}-3{\displaystyle 3}       <subtract 8 from both sides)


y=1{\displaystyle y=1}            (divide both sides by -3, to get solution)




, Verify that you have done the work correctly by checking your solutions. You should be able to place your two solutions, in this example x=8{\displaystyle x=8} and y=1{\displaystyle y=1}, into each of the original equations. When you then simplify the equations, you will get true statements.

For example, start with the first equation:


x−3y=5{\displaystyle x-3y=5}         (original equation)


8−3∗1=5{\displaystyle 8-3*1=5}        (insert values of x and y)


8−3=5{\displaystyle 8-3=5}         (simplify multiplication)


5=5{\displaystyle 5=5}           (simplify subtraction to get solution)

The true statement 5=5 shows that the solution is correct.



Now try the second equation:


2x+3y=19{\displaystyle 2x+3y=19}           (original equation)


2∗8+3∗1=19{\displaystyle 2*8+3*1=19}         (insert values of x and y)


16+3=19{\displaystyle 16+3=19}           (simplify multiplication)


19=19{\displaystyle 19=19}            (simplify addition to get solution)

The true statement 19=19 shows that the solution is correct.
 The final solution, which you have proven to work in both equations, is x=8{\displaystyle x=8} and y=1{\displaystyle y=1}.

If you are working on graphing linear functions, you may also write your solution as an ordered pair. This for this example, you would write x=8{\displaystyle x=8} and y=1{\displaystyle y=1} in the form (8,1){\displaystyle (8,1)}.

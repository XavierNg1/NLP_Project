 Try to gently chip off as much of the top layer of paint as possible. Any paint you can remove this way will be less paint that the alcohol has to cut through. Be careful not to dig into the wood and leave scratch marks behind.
 Use basic rubbing alcohol, which can be purchased at most drugstores or grocery stores. Place the cloth on top of the open bottle and shake it once or twice to saturate a small section of the cloth.
 Keep adding alcohol to the cloth and continue rubbing until all the paint is gone. Alcohol can damage the wood's finish, so only use it on the exact area of the paint stain., Moisten a clean cloth with a bit of water and wipe the area with it to remove all the remaining residue. The wood may still smell of alcohol, but that will dissipate over time.
 Rub the damp spot until all excess moisture is removed. The wood will still be wet, but should dry within 24 hours.

 This not only includes the price paid for the rights but also the specific terms of the agreement. These terms can include the specific mineral(s) you want to extract,the legal description of the property, how you’ll access the property, what steps you’ll take in preventing damage to the property, how you’ll fix any damage that occurs, the use of any available fresh water and many other factors.In most mineral rights transactions the buyer has the most say in how the mining will be conducted, when it will take place, how and what will be done, if anything, to fix the property afterwards. If the seller wants any control when the mining starts, he must think about what could go wrong and develop a contract that will cover his wishes, and that of future generations., Make sure both you and the owner understand all the terms set forth before both of you sign the agreement to finalize the deal. If you’re unfamiliar with negotiating to buy mineral rights, you should consult an attorney who specializes in the sale and transfer of mineral rights.Include access to fresh water in the agreement. Oil and gas mining requires a large quantity of fresh water during the mining process. If you can have access to nearby water, it will save you a lot of money.Confirm both access, price, and any limits to use of water.
The agreement should cover a long time period as you may not want to begin mining right away.
 If you decide to lease the mineral rights, the agreement will have extra terms, such as the length of the lease and amount of the royalty payment for the owner. The royalty payment is typically a combination of cash and royalty; a percentage of the production value or a fixed amount per ton or barrel of produced minerals.Do not attempt to write up the mineral rights lease yourself. Contact an attorney experienced in mineral rights leasing. Some states have laws that require mining and drilling companies to pay a minimum royalty percentage to property owners.

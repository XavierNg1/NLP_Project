 Before you can begin your bee-hunting adventure, you’ll need the proper tool to catch them with. Like all insects, they must be caught with the bug net.


If you don’t already have a bug net, you can buy one for 500 bells at the Nookling Store run by Timmy and Tommy. This store can be found in the shopping plaza—simply head north, past the train station, and up the cobblestone to reach the plaza.
Make sure the net is in your inventory when you begin searching for bees.;
, That is, not fruit trees. This is because beehives will not fall from fruit trees.


Beehives can be found during any time of day, during any season, however only about 3–4 will appear each day. Bees can only be found by shaking trees; a hive will fall out after a tree has been shaken.
 To shake a tree, approach it without anything equipped, and hit “A.”


Always stand to the north of the tree, and make sure there is plenty of room to run upwards. Do not shake trees south of rivers and buildings.
 If a beehive falls out, the player will pause for a quick shock reaction, before being chased by the insects. As soon as you can move, run north. Do this by pressing the analog stick upwards while holding down the “B” button.


Once you’ve run far enough so that the bees are no longer visible on screen, hit the “X” button to open your inventory. Equip the bug net—doing so should automatically make your character face south, so you will be ready to catch the bees once they catch up.
When you’re ready, hit the “X” button once more to close the inventory. Keep an eye out for the bees; once you see the swarm at the bottom of the screen, hit “A” to capture them.

 Many people have problems because they didn't groom their cat's coat in earlier life, because it wasn't necessary to do so. However, as the cat gets older and needs a little help, they are unfamiliar with what you are trying to do and can resent the tugging and pulling on their skin. The cat then hisses or spits, and it can become dangerous to continue.In an ideal world you would plan ahead and get the cat used to being groomed and accept it as a pleasant experience from kittenhood. This involves short daily grooming sessions accompanied by lots of praise and a treat or two. Kittens under around 18 weeks of age are receptive to new experiences so the more she is brushed before she reaches this age the more she accepts it as normal.;
, Cats shed hair all the time. Mostly the cat grooms out the shed hair or else it is rubbed off on your sofa and clothes. However, older cats that are arthritic and stiff, can have difficulty turning around to get to all parts of their body. This means the shed hair doesn't get shifted and sits in place clogging up the rest of the coat.


You can usually tell if your cat has this problem because the coat has a "felted" appearance and is dull. If you grasp some of the hair tips in the felted area and pull gently the hairs come away painlessly., Long-haired cats usually have a soft coat that is subject to static and tangles easily. The first places to get knotted are those areas where fur rubs on fur, such as in the armpits, between the back legs, under the chin, and behind the ears. However, when the cat curls up to sleep the fur can also mat up.Certain breeds of cats, including Persians, Birmans and Himalayans, have silky, fine hair that is especially prone to matting. Pay extra close attention to brushing and grooming these breeds and other long-hair cats.

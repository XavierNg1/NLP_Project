 The ink cartridge is the part of the tag that juts out of the plastic. It is on the opposite side of the pin, which is the round part of the tag.;
, Move it as far away as possible so the ink doesn't ruin the clothing as much if the sensor cracks.
 The rubber band should be large and thick enough to be strong, but thin enough to fit around the pin. This will loosen the pin.
, The pressure of the pins should be strong enough so that the pin eventually pops off or easily pulls apart from the rest of the tag.


If the rubber band didn't loosen it enough, try again with multiple rubber bands.

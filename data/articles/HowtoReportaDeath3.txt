 You may need to speak to the human resources department or another company representative. If the person is retired, but receiving a pension, call the office responsible for the pension.
 Contact your representative at the insurance company and report the death. You may need to fax or copy the death certificate to start compensation procedures in motion.
 You may be asked to come into the bank and fill out information. Bring the death certificate with you when you go.
 Mortgage companies, lenders, financial planners and pension companies should be called so that the necessary arrangements can be made to change the name on the accounts and continue any necessary payments.
 Instruct the companies to close the account because the account holder is deceased. Include a copy of the death certificate and all former addresses in each letter.

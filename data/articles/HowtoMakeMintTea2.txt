 Using the ratio for a larger batch, make your hot mint tea. Just place the mint leaves in a large heat-safe bowl and pour the boiling water directly over the top. Allow to steep.


To make a single serving, use the same mint–water ratio and method as you would for a mug of hot mint tea.
 Once the tea is ready, squeeze the lemon juice into the tea, making sure you don’t get any seeds in the tea. Add your sweetener of choice, to taste, if you want sweet tea. Stir vigorously to break down the sugar particles.


Agave nectar also works well as a liquid sweetener and honey substitute.
 Once it’s cool, strain the tea into a pitcher and discard the used mint leaves. Refrigerate until it’s cold., When the tea has chilled, and you are ready to serve it, fill your glasses with ice. Thinly slice a cucumber and add a few slices to each glass. Pour the tea and enjoy.

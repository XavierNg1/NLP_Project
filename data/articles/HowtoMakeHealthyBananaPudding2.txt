 Separate four eggs, keeping all of the egg yolks. In a medium-sized glass, whisk together the yolks, honey, and arrowroot powder. Whisk until the ingredients are thoroughly mixed., In a small saucepan, heat the coconut milk over medium heat for five minutes, stirring it occasionally. Then slowly pour the warm coconut milk into the egg mixture, whisking it constantly. Pour the entire mixture back into the saucepan and cook it over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir regularly to avoid boiling and remove it once the pudding thickens.Stirring regularly helps heat the mixture evenly and prevents it from burning.

Feed it through until curled slices of the zucchini are produced., Put all of the ingredients into a large bowl. The “zoodles” should also be in the bowl. Gently toss the salad to mix all of the ingredients together., Put olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, salt, and pepper into a smaller, separate bowl. Whisk all of the ingredients together. Pour the dressing over the salad, and toss the salad to coat it in the dressing., Put the salad into the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes after it has been coated in the dressing.

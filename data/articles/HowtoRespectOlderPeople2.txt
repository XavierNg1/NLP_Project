 Older people can often feel isolated because they usually aren’t working any longer and it’s not always easy for them to go out. That’s especially true for elderly people who live in a nursing or retirement home. Take time out of your schedule to visit with the older people in your life as often as you can, so they know that they’re still important to you.If you’re very busy and can’t make it to see the older people in your life as often as you’d like, calling them can be a good alternative. You might even set up a time to call each week, so you have a schedule to stick to.
 It’s easy to think that older people don’t have much going on because they don’t do many of the things that they used to when they were younger. However, many elderly people are still active, and lead full, busy lives, even if that just means playing bingo, waking in the park, and gardening. When you visit or call the older people in your life, make sure to ask about their favorite activities.If your grandparent, aunt, uncle, or other elderly loved one has a hobby that they particularly enjoy, you might even offer to do it with them. That’s a great way to show them just how interested you are in what’s important to them.
 While it’s true that your elderly loved ones may need help with some details of their lives, such as chores around the house or making sense of tax forms, they probably aren’t completely helpless. You should offer your assistance, but it’s important to respect them enough to let them make their own decisions as long as they’re able to.

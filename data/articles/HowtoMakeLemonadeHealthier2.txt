 Watermelon is sweet enough that you can use it in lemon juice without having to add extra sugar. Simply blend four cups of cubed watermelon with a tablespoon of lemon juice in a blender until you have a slushy mixture. Add more lemon juice, about a teaspoon at a time, until you have the right flavor.For added taste, serve the lemon juice with fresh mint leaves at the bottom of each glass.
 In a large jar, place four thinly sliced strawberries, a handful of raspberries, and two slices of lemons. Fill the jar with water and leave it in the refrigerator overnight. Pour out the water from the jar. The fruit gives the water a sweet, tangy flavor. This makes for a great sugar- and calorie- free lemonade., Make herb-infused water by boiling one to two ounces of dried rosemary in a quart of water. Then, allow the water to steep for 15 to 20 minutes. Strain out the rosemary and add three medium-sized lemons, cut into slices, into the water as well as a quarter cup of honey or maple syrup. Add a cup of raspberries. Then, chill the mixture in the refrigerator. The water should be flavored naturally by the fruit.If the mixture does not have enough of a lemonade taste, try adding some lemon juice to the water.
 In a blender, combine two cups of cubed mangoes, the juice from a medium lemon, and twelve ounces of water. Blend everything together until you have a smooth, even consistency.For added sweetness, you can add one to two teaspoons of honey. However, this is not usually necessary as mangoes are a very sweet fruit.
If the water, mangoes, and lemon juice are cold enough, it is not necessary to chill this mixture. However, it may be a good idea if you were using room temperature supplies.

 Use a trapezoid shape with softer edges for the head, and mark a cross inside that same shape. Use a rectangle for the body. Notice that kittens have bigger heads in proportion to the body as compared to a full grown cat.


The cross in the face should help you determine where the eyes, nose, and mouth go. The middle point of the cross should be at the approximate middle of the face.
Note that the head should overlap the body. The top line of the body should roughly match the horizontal cross-line of the face.;
, Sketch a draft of the kitten’s limbs. Each limb should be a rounded triangle coming off the bottom of the body rectangle. Note that the legs on the "far" side of the kitten should be slightly smaller than those on the "near" side.


Similarly, draw two large triangles over the top corners of the head. For a cartoonish look, these triangles should be bigger than those made for the legs.
 You can draw a wavy, rounded tail or a more angled one depending on personal preference. Either way, the tail should have at least one bend in it; do not draw the tail perfectly straight.
 Using the cross inside the square as guide, draw two small circles for the eyes, placing them evenly on either side of the vertical center and just above the horizontal center.


Add the nose and mouth. The nose should land on the vertical center and rest below the horizontal center. The mouth should look like a rounded "W" with the center attached to the bottom of the nose.
 You can draw slim curved lines for a furry effect. Add three straight whiskers on each of the kitten’s cheeks.
 Many cats have striped fur, so you can add this detail if you want. Draw a few triangular stripes on the kitten's back and tail.
 This includes overlapping lines and the cross-lines of the face.
 You can use any colors desired. Consider giving the kitten light brown fur. If you added stripes, make the stripes a slightly different shade.

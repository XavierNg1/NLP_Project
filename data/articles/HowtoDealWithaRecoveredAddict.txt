 During recovery an addict is struggling to subdue that characteristic in themselves, but it is still there. Nonetheless, given that they are honest and intent on changing, there is nothing stopping them from becoming a respectable person. With a sincere change in their thinking process and enough time, they can overcome the characteristics that led them to addiction.;
, Remember that abstinence from use does not necessarily mean a change in their thinking process. How do they treat you and those around them? How do they care for their belongings? Do they still have addictive tendencies (smoking, for instance, or compulsive behaviors)? Do they excuse wrong behaviors? Do they seem sincere or are they apologizing too much? What has really changed?

, Do not instantly become close again. Give them time to consider exactly what has been lost to their habits and the thought process with which the habits were established, and make it clear that severe relapse might lead to the end of the friendship.
 Be steadfast, and set an example of consistency in all aspects of your life. Do not flaunt or push too strongly for your friend's consistency. Instead, be a calm paradigm.
 Without seeming manipulative, introduce them to activities conducive to a clean life. Once they have truly changed their thought process(recovered), they will begin to disassociate themselves more from addicted friends and associated activities. Encouraging them to participate in productive activities, especially those involving service and other activities that establish self worth, will be a great benefit in assisting the transition from 'recovering' to 'recovered'. The goal is to create a drug free environment for your friend to grow accustomed to, and to ease the recovery process.

 We hold onto things because they 'may come in handy someday'. Let go of that fear.;
, How many times have you bought multiples of the same item because you couldn't find something you bought earlier in the year? It does you no good to squirrel dozens of things away if you can't find them when you need them.
 If you don't love it, toss it! Better yet, donate it to someone who could really use it. Stop piling up things for a yard sale you know you're never going to host. Get rid of it!

, If you block out time on each Wednesday on your way to work, or on the way to your Bridge Club meeting, you can get things out of your house on a weekly basis.
 Never keep more than two issues of any publication around. You can keep the current issue and the last issue. If you have not read these by the time the next issue comes, you are never going to read them, so recycle them now.
 If it needs to be filed, do so. If it needs to be signed and returned, do so. Keep your calendar near your 'checking' station so you can write down important dates and then toss the paper clutter!

,, When your things are organized, you can find them more easily and are less likely to purchase duplicates. If you don't have a good place for something, you should evaluate whether you really love and need the object, or whether someone less fortunate would be better off owning it.
 Do you really need a cappuccino maker for that once a month special coffee you like to make? Maybe you can borrow the machine from your neighbor who does not have room for garden equipment. You can lend her your wheelbarrow every once in a while in return.

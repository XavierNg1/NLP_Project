 Make your way around your home, giving the wood siding a look over. You want to look for spots that are especially grimy or might have collected mildew. Make a mental note of these spots.This is also a good time to look for any structural problems, such as cracks and dents, as some of these may let water in while you clean.;
, Usually, water is sufficient for cleaning wood siding. Work your way from the bottom of the wall to the top. Make sure to keep your garden hose aimed downwards; this will prevent water from going up and getting stuck in siding panels which could damage it.


If your home’s siding is pretty dirty all over, you may want to use siding cleaner. You can find it in bottles that attach to garden hoses, allowing you to easily clean your home’s exterior., Use a cleaner specifically designed for cleaning siding and always check the label to make sure it’s safe for wood. Use a spray bottle to squirt cleaner onto the grimier spots and scrub with a soft brush.


After scrubbing thoroughly, make sure to rinse the cleaner with a garden hose.

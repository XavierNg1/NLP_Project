 This helps greatly reduce the incidence of electric shock. If working on a bare floor is not an option, consider applying a light coating of anti-static spray to the rug or carpet prior to handling electronics.;
, Pets with hair such as dogs, cats, and ferrets can increase the risk for electric shock if they come into contact with you or your electronics.
 Static electricity buildup occurs most frequently in dry, cold environments.
 Items such as paper, plastic bins, and cellophane can all generate static when being moved around on your desk or workspace.
 A grounded object is something that has a direct conductive path to the earth, such as a water pipe, wall, or wood table. When working with computers, the most ideal way to ground yourself is to touch the exterior metal box of your computer's power supply before unplugging the machine.
 This device prevents static buildup by tethering you directly to your computer so the charge is shared, and discharging cannot occur., These types of mats, also known as ESD or grounding mats can help prevent electric shock.
 This prevents any electric currents from running through the machine as you work.
 Electricity is normally transmitted via exposed pins, connectors, and circuitry located away from the edges of CPU and components.

 Guernseys are typically fawn to brown with white patches. Most white markings are found on Guernsey cattle on the shoulder or behind the elbows, up from the flanks and sometimes in front of the hips; though some cattle may have many more patches behind their shoulders on the rest of the body.Guernseys often have white on the belly and on each leg often below the knees and hocks.
Many other Guernseys will have a white diamond or star-shaped patch on the center of their foreheads.;
, Guernseys are a dairy breed, so they often have an angular body shape and large udders (in cows only, remember) Guernsey cattle are only slightly larger than Jersey cattle.Bulls also have the angular shape in the rump, unlike most other beef bulls.
Most Guernsey cows do not exceed 1200 lbs.
 Guernsey cattle can be identified by the unique characteristics of their heads as compared to other cattle breeds. Guernsey cattle are medium sized, with proportionate, but slight, heads.Guernsey males and females both have fairly feminine looking features when compared to other cattle like Red Angus.
Guernsey cattle are born both horned and poled (or naturally without horns).
 In order to properly identify Guernsey cattle, you will need to determine the animalâ€™s gender. Gender is usually easily determined visually from a distance, but in the event the bull is malnourished, the differences between the genders may be less apparent.Males, or bulls, will usually have heavily muscled shoulders and much thicker necks than females.
Bulls also often have a hump just behind the neck that is easily visible from a distance.
Both male and female Guernsey cattle may have horns.

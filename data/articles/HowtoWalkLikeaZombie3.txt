 Act like you’re still capable of thought. Remember that a zombie is reanimated flesh, which includes the brain; the only change is that it's decayed and not working as well as it used to.Impair your thought process. Know exactly what you want (food–or, more specifically, yummy human brains) but be far less sure of how to get it. Pretend that even the simplest tasks require way more problem-solving than normal, including problem-solving!, Think of how decayed your body is, including all the relays between your brain and each part of your body. Imagine every joint in your body as a relay station that isn’t working right. For every command your brain sends to any part of your body, picture the command traveling down the wire and meeting interference along the way before it reaches its final destination.
 Think one thought: “Me want brains!” Focus on your one objective. Move with that one purpose. Ignore everything else.
 Since alcohol clouds the thought-process and impairs motor function, drunk people pretty much act like zombies, so study their behavior to mimic later.Notice the way they hardly ever walk straight. Note how they have to constantly stop what they’re doing and rethink how to do it. Also pay attention to what stimuli they fail to react to right away or even notice at all.

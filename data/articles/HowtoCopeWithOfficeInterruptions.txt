 If you have an actual office, close the door when you need to get something done. Make it absolutely clear, either by sign or by oral discussion with colleagues, that when the door is closed, you're out of bounds but when it's open, you can be interrupted. Be sure to make a good balance between shut and open door times though; no shutting yourself off all of the time!


For those working in cubicles, it's a lot harder to create a physical barrier to shut people out for a set period. Perhaps try using a sign that says "Please don't interrupt the flow until 3pm" or move your chair, a bookcase, a filing cabinet, large plant or something else in such a way that makes it hard for anyone to get near you or at least indicates that your privacy is currently paramount.;
, Don't take calls for set periods of time when you need to get something done.
 That way, you can get on with things without being sidelined by usually non-urgent email messages.
 If someone does wander into your office or over to your desk, try this simple solution. After hearing out their first few sentences, simply stand up. Don't move away or say anything, just stand up. This is such a pace changer that the other person will get the message that they need to wrap up and move on.
 Develop codes together for indicating politely when a person doesn't wish to be interrupted.

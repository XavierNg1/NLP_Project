 First, draw a diagonal line and then an identical line to the first one, just to the opposite direction.;
, Draw a curved line with the ends connecting with the chin. Make sure it is a bit lighter than the chin, for you will need to erase it or draw over it eventually.
 Draw two curved lines coming off of the chin. Then draw almost straight lines, fluently coming off the neck, and then curve it for the shoulders.
 The torso will not be connected to the shoulders or anything yet. To draw the bosom, you will draw two half circles near the shoulders. For the waist, you will curve two lines in, from the bosom, and then curve them out.
 For this, you will need to curve two lines the opposite direction of the waist. Make sure it is flowing from the waist.
 From the lines you drew for the hips, just draw a straight line connecting the hip lines.
 Draw a curved line coming off from the hips, and then stop curving it in to make the line straighter. Do the same on the other side of the leg, but the opposite direction. For the other leg, do one line to the right of the first leg so it looks as though one leg is behind the other.
 You pretty much just draw the rest of the leg, just make it a little wider. Then draw her feet with a slight point at the ends. Make both shoes pointing opposite directions to each other.
 Draw a slightly bumped bun on top of her head. Then draw the same thing on the inside of her head, going with shape of the top of her head. Now you could either erase the top of her head, or just color it in.
 Then put two circles/triangles underneath each 'eye lid'. For the nose, add two symmetrical-in curving lines. Then add a little rectangle for the nose. The eyebrows are just curved lines that are identical to the eyelids.
 You could really do anything you want with the arms.
 Uhura has a sort of slant to her collar and on her insignia thing she has a spiral.
 You're done!

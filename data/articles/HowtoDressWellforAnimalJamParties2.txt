 Use any girly head item, and a glove or bracelets. All necklaces are allowed. If you don't have a glove or bracelets, you can buy a pair of high heels of any color. The color should match your outfit.

For little girls: Designer skirt, head flower and leg armor. If you wish, you could wear these in pink , purple , or magenta.


Boys: Get a tuxedo if possible, but otherwise, drop it out, and maybe use a boy coloured blanket. Wear a tie, and a glove if you have one. Black and white colors are good.

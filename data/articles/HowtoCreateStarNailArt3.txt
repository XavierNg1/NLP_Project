 Adding a touch of glitter to your stars can also help to enhance them. Try painting some glitter nail polish over a finished star shape, or apply glitter nail polish over your entire nail.

Choose a glitter that will go well with your nail polish. For example, silver might look good with blue nails and white stars, or gold glitter might look nice with green nails with gold stars.
 Drawing a few different sized stars on each nail is another way to add interest to your star nail art. Try drawing one large star and two smaller ones or vice versa.You can vary the stars between nails as well. For example, you could do a large star on each of your ring fingers and then do smaller stars on the rest of your fingers.
 You can transform a star into a shooting star by adding a few swoops of nail polish behind it. Try using a couple of different colors or a glittery nail polish to get a shooting star effect.

To turn a regular star into a shooting star, use the paint brush to paint on a few arching lines extending from one side of the star. This will look best with a smaller star that has some room next to it for the arching lines.
 Your stars do not need to be completely visible on your nails either. You can start a star near the edge or corner of your nail and just draw as much of it as you can.Drawing stars this way works best for larger sized stars. Try painting two larger sized stars on one side of your nail, or cut a star shape in half and place it near the edge or tip of your nail.

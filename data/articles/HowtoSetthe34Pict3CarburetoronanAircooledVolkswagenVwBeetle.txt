 Ensure the air cleaner is ON when adjusting the carburetor.
 It is controlled by the accelerator cable that runs to the accelerator pedal in the cabin.

On the top of the throttle arm, facing to the rear of the car, is a screw called the Fast Idle Adjuster.

This works with the choke to give a smooth idle on a cold engine.
As the choke warms in concert with the warming engine, the butterfly valve in the throat of the carburetor opens and the Fast Idle Adjuster moves down the stepped cam, reducing the engine idle speed.


Make sure that the choke is fully open and the Fast Idle Adjuster screw is resting on the very bottom of the stepped cam.

Unscrew the Fast Idle Adjuster screw until it is clear of the stepped cam.
Screw it in until it just touches the very bottom of the stepped cam -- NOT on any of the steps themselves.
Now screw it in another 1/4 turn. This sets the throttle butterfly open the required 0.004 inch (0.0Â cm).
 Turn the Bypass Screw (the larger one) out a couple of turns, to get things started.

The Volume Control Screw is the smaller of the two adjusting screws.

Screw it in GENTLY until it bottoms.
Now unscrew it exactly 2-1/2 turns. This is the starting setting.
Start the engine and use the Bypass Screw to set the idle at 850 rpm.


It should not be much outside the range of 2-3 turns 1/2 turn in/out from the basic 2-1/2 turn out setting.
Turn the screw back IN very slowly until the revs drop by about 25-30 rpm.


If you find it difficult or impossible to make these settings, it is possible that you could have stripped threads on any of these adjusters, a damaged hole for the tapered screw, or a damaged needle valve or O-ring.

If you find it difficult or impossible to make these settings, it is also possible that you have a vacuum leak (i.e., leaking of air into the intake manifold).

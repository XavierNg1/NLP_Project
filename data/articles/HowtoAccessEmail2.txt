 These kinds of programs lets you access your email accounts without having to log into any websites. It also downloads your messages and contact information locally on your computer so you can access it even while offline.


Common email client applications include Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, Lotus Notes, and Apple’s Mail app.
These applications normally come with either your computer (Mail app) or with the office suite package you’re using on your PC (MS Outlook and Mozilla Thunderbird). On the other hand, if you don’t have any of these applications yet, you can download it over the Internet and install it on your computer. There are several websites available on the net where you can get these programs.
 During the first launch, you’ll be asked to enter your email account information. These details include your email username and password. Supply this information on the text fields provided to set up your email account on the client application.


You’ll also be asked to input your email account’s POP3, SMTP, and port settings. You may contact your email service provider or your firm’s IT personnel (if you’re setting up a company email) to acquire these particular settings.
 After providing all the necessary information, save the settings you’ve entered to finalize and complete the setup.
 The program will start downloading all your messages and contact information from the server and saving it locally on your computer. This may take a few moments depending on the number of messages you have on your account.


After syncing, your inbox will contain all the messages you have. From here on, you can access your email account’s inbox, and send and receive messages using the email client software.

 Use slightly contrasting colors of paint, applied with a rag to get a textured appearance to the ceiling. You can also use a sponge in a similar manner to get another texture.
 You can mix joint compound into the paint in order to get a faux plaster look. You can buy either a mix or the prepared compound. You will likely need a great deal of the material (at least 6 lbs of the prepared compound) but how much will depend on the area you are covering and how thick you want it to be.
 You can also use textured rollers to get other textures to your paint without having to apply multiple coats. You can use shaggy rollers or other textured rollers. These should generally have examples of their final textures on the packaging.

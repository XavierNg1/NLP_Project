 Welcome every guest to your home and tell them how pleased you are to have them. Show you care about their comfort by taking their things and offering them a drink. Even if you can’t meet them at the door during a party, be sure to stop whatever you’re doing to say “hello” and “welcome.”, Take a few minutes to interact with every party or overnight guest so they continue to feel welcome. At a party you should also introduce your guests to each other at the beginning of the evening. Look out for your shy party guests. Help them feel included by asking them to help you with the food or the music.
 Give guests a tour if they haven’t been in your home before. Or ask them to explore and make themselves at home if that’s okay with you. This is a good time to share any boundaries in your home and to tell them about any quirks in your house, like plumbing problems or doors that don’t lock.For overnight guests, prepare a map of your area (even if you need to draw it yourself), a spare key to your house, a list of emergency contacts, and any household instructions, like how your alarm system works.
 It’s very important that you enjoy yourself. Set the tone for your guests by relaxing and having a good time. Keep up a positive attitude and be flexible, especially if things don’t go as planned.


If you do run into a problem, ask your guests for help. Most people will love to pitch in.

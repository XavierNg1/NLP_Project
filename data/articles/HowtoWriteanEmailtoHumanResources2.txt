 First, thank the representative for taking the time to look into your case, as this will immediately set a tone of courtesy in your conversation. Be sure to reply to any response human resources sends quickly. This will indicate that you remain concerned about the problem, and it should also communicate your desire to address it sooner rather than later.
 Prepare yourself for the meeting by creating a special file folder containing any documents you plan to bring. If you have a policy question, bring the employee handbook with the specific policies bookmarked. This will help the meeting run smoothly once you arrive., If you’re worried about protecting yourself from any actions the company may take against you, talk to a lawyer. They can provide you with information about your rights, and you may decide to bring them to any in-person meetings. You might want to inform human resources of your plans to employ a lawyer if you choose to go this route.Be sure you’re aware of the costs associated with hiring a lawyer. Most will be costly, so you’ll need to weigh these budgetary concerns with your need for legal protection.
 A week is generally considered an appropriate amount of time to wait before sending a follow-up email. If you’re dealing with an especially urgent problem, you can send a follow-up after 24 hours. Rather than worrying that you’re nagging your representative, remember that they have many responsibilities. They may need a reminder that you’re one of them.

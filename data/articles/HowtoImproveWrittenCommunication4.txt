 Writing concisely means you must convey your message in as few words as necessary. Eliminate any extra or unnecessary words that convolute your message. For example, don’t write, “I am emailing concerning the matter of your last report.” Instead try writing, “I am emailing about your last report.” Try substituting “regardless of the fact that” with a simple “although.” If you feel the urge to write “due to the fact that,” try writing “because” instead., Combining pairs of words with similar meaning should be avoided. Doing so only clutters the sentence and does little to convey your message. Examples of redundant pairs include sudden crisis, each individual, future plans, and past history. Don’t write, “The true facts of the case are clear.” Instead try writing, “The facts of the case are clear.”, You should not use words that do not add meaning or have relevance to the sentence. Words like obviously, basically, very, really, and clearly should be eliminated from effective written communication. For example, you should not write, “Actually, Amanda kind of looked at the elephant when it was basically urinating.” Instead write, “Amanda looked at the elephant while it was urinating.”, Oftentimes you can eliminate an entire phrase by simply replacing it with a single word. For example, phrases like “in the event that” and “under circumstances in which” can be replaced with the word “if.”

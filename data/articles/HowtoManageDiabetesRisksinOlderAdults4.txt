 A great way to manage the risks of diabetes is to eat healthy. However, older adults with diabetes face an array of challenges when trying to eat healthy. Not only do you need to manage calories, sugar levels, and nutrition, but you have to be very weight-conscious in order to avoid cardiovascular disease.


Avoid excess sweets.
Eat a well-balanced diet.
Make sure to get enough vitamins., Frequent exercise is key to managing diabetes risk. However, older adults are at special risk since their age makes exercise more difficult and opens them up to larger dangers than younger adults.


Make sure to adopt a frequent exercise schedule. Try to exercise at least 30 minutes a day.
Consider low-impact exercises such as using an elliptical or cycling.
Be mindful of the dangers of a fall. One of the biggest dangers to older adults who exercise frequently is the danger of a fall. Older adults should be especially mindful of this danger since they may not heal as quickly due to age and due to diabetes.
Watch for the danger of overexertion. Older adults, especially, may be susceptible to overexerting themselves, pulling muscles, or aggravating heart conditions or similar cardiovascular diseases.
Consult with your doctor before you commit to any exercise routine., Don't let your diabetes get in the way of you enjoying your life. Maintaining a vibrant social life is an important part of staying healthy -- both mentally and physically. Consider:


Frequenting the senior center in your community. You might find other people, talks, or education offered at your senior center.
Enroll in continuing education courses.
Join diabetes support groups.
Become more active in your neighborhood or community.

 Many times business owners lease rather than purchase equipment. While lenders do not have to charge an explicit rate in a lease agreement in the U.S., finance firms making the loan are required to calculate the cost of borrowing for you.


For example, a food products company needs to lease a large pasteurizing machine. They decide to lease rather than purchase it. If the total cost of the lease is $1,000 and the company makes 12 payments of $100 per month, then the lease agreement has an implicit interest rate of 20%.
 When purchasing bonds, an implicit interest rate is the difference between the current yield (dividend) paid on a bond and the rate that the bondholder will receive at a fixed point in the future. The implicit rate may change from the rate stated in the bond contract at the time of purchase, since bonds can rise or fall in value during the bond term.


For example, you purchase bonds with a promised dividend of $5.00 per share to be paid in one year. Due to fluctuations in the marketplace, you receive $10.00 per share on the one-year due date. The implicit interest rate earned is 50%.
 If there is not an explicit interest stated, you should always calculate the implied interest rate before signing a lease or taking out a loan. This rate will determine your total financing expense. Do not rely only on monthly payment amounts or short-term yields on bonds before making financing decisions.

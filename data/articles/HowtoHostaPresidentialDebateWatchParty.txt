 Typically, debates are held on a weeknight in the evening or late afternoon, depending on your time zone and the actual location of the debate. Unless you plan on hosting more than one presidential debate party, you will need to decide which party's debate to view (Democratic or Republican, held on different dates).;
, For example, if viewing a Democratic debate, send out blue invitations with donkeys on the borders to match that party's color and symbol. Let your guests know exactly where and when the party will be held.
 The most important item you will need is a large TV or projection system to view the debate, as it is being broadcast on national television. Other items you will need include the following:


Open, comfortable sitting area or plenty of chairs in view of the TV
A good sound system
Party food and drinks

, During commercial breaks, socialize with your guests and get their opinions on who they feel is winning the debate, what the best lines of the night have been thus far, etc.
 One idea you can get creative with is presidential debate bingo. Make cards with certain topics on different squares, and as they are brought up in the debate, or the specific scenario happens, mark it off.

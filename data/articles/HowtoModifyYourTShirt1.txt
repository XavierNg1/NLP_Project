 Keep in mind that if the shirt is especially long, you can use it as a dress. If it makes an especially short dress, you can wear leggings or skinny jeans underneath for a casual, Bohemian style.;
, If you are altering a lot of shirts, try to locate a tape measure and measure what to cut of each one.
 You'll want to use 3 to 5 pins running from the armpit to the bottom. If you're going for a tight fit, you might want to use safety pins so you don't get poked as you're taking off the shirt. Try to pinch equal amounts of fabric on each side.
,

For length adjustments, fold the fabric towards the side that will be against your skin to make a hem. For seams, just sew the fabric together, making sure it doesn't bunch up. You can do this by hand or machine.






If you're not sure whether your markings will result in a good fit, use a long stitch that will hold the fabric together but will be easy to remove if the shirt doesn't fit well. Don't do any cutting yet.
 Mark where it's too tight, loose, long or short.


If it fits well, go over the seams again with a stronger stitch. This would be a good point to use a sewing machine if you have one, though it's not necessary.
If it doesnâ€™t fit properly, repeat the above steps, tearing out any previous stitches before sewing new ones until the shirt fits the way that you want.
 Your T-shirt should now be fitted, sleek and lump-free.

 Rinse 4 mangoes under running water to get any dirt particles off.;
, Use a serrated vegetable peeler to remove all of the skin. Cut them in half and try to cut away as much meat from the pit as you can.
 Cut each mango into small slices or 1 inch (2.54 cm) pieces. Ensuring the fruit is in small pieces will be very helpful in cooking and pureeing.
 Measure and add about a cup of water into a large saucepan. Add a steamer basket in the saucepan so that it fits perfectly.
 Ensure that the fruit is spread out through the basket instead of clumped in the middle. Cover the saucepan with a lid.
 Allow the water to bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and allow the fruit to cook for 5 minutes. Reserve the liquid for pureeing.
 Remove the pan from the heat and let it sit for about an additional 5 minutes. You will know when the fruit is properly steamed when you can easily mash it with a fork.
 To make it easier for the fruit to puree, add about 2 to 4 tablespoons of liquid from the saucepan.
 Allow the mixture to come to a smooth texture. About halfway through, completely stop the processor and scrap the sides down.


For a juice, pour over a strainer to catch any pieces to make it more drinkable.
 Using a tablespoon, fill in each ice cube slot just below the rim of the tray.
 Place the ice cube tray(s) in the freezer and allow the mixture to freeze overnight.
 Use a permanent marker to jot down what food you made and the current date.
 Remove the cubes from the trays by placing the backs of it under running hot water or gently bending the trays back and forth.
 Frozen baby food will keep for about two months. Any defrosted food will keep in the refrigerator for two days, so only take out as much as you need for the time being.

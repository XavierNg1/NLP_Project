 Spray the cardboard with some spray-on adhesive and cover it with a piece of colorful fabric. Trim off the excess fabric and turn the panel over so that the back/undecorated side is facing you. Place a square of double-sided foam tape on each corner.Pop each panel into the spaces between the shelves. Press down on the corners to make the tape stick.


You can also use drawer liner, wallpaper, or even wrapping paper. The drawer liner does not need to be glued onto the cardboard, as it already is sticky on the back.
 Choose a ribbon that is the same width as the edges of your shelves. Cut the ribbon so that it is the same length as the shelf. Apply some double-sided tape along the edges of your bookshelf where you want the ribbon to be. Press the ribbon down onto the tape.You can also use scrapbooking tape. It comes in many different colors and patterns. Stick the end of the tape onto one of the ends of the shelf, and roll it across the edge. When you get to the other end of the shelf, snip the tape off.
 You can secure them by taping the rope part to the top corners of the bookshelf. You can also drill a tiny hole into each top corner of the bookshelf and twist in a small cup-hook; the garland or lights can drape over this.


You can purchase flower garlands and battery-operated string lights at an arts and crafts store.
Most flower garlands are between six and eight feet long. You can trim them down to the width of your bookshelf using a pair of wire cutters, or you can leave the garland as it is; the ends will drape against the sides of your bookshelf.
 Purchase a set of battery-operated shelving or cabinet lights and some double-sided foam mounting tape. Peel the tape off the card and stick it to the back of the light; try to get it as centered as possible. Peel the backing off, and then press the light to the underside of the shelf.

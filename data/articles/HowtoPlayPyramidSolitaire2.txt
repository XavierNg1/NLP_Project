 Place matched cards in a separate discard pile. This is the fundamental move in pyramid solitaire.


Cards are only considered free when no other card is on top of them.
Ace is low in this game and has a value of 1.
Face cards are assigned special values: Jacks are 11, Queens are 12, and Kings are 13.
Kings do not need a second card to form a match. Any free Kings can be removed on their own at any time., A certain percentage of hands are unwinnable, and learning to recognize them will save you some frustration. The main thing to look for are instances where all four of a particular card are part of a tableau below one or more of their matches.


For example, if the very top of your pyramid is an ace and you have two Queens in your bottom row, one in your sixth row, and one in your fourth row, you have an unwinnable hand. At least one Queen is inherently impossible to match, making the top ace unreachable.Many computerized versions of pyramid solitaire weed out the unwinnable games for you.
 The waste is a second stack of cards that is essentially the stock in reverse. Like the stock, the cards are oriented face up and the top card is free. You don't have to be stuck without a match to do this. In fact, it's prudent to move a playable card to the waste first. Doing so may reveal a second playable card underneath or otherwise give you more information for forming you strategy., Your aim is to match every card in the deck, and matches between the stock and waste are less likely to occur than matches to the tableau. You will have multiple chances to cycle through your stock to match with the tableau cards.
 For basic pyramid solitaire, the game is over when:


You have matched and removed every card in the tableau, stock, and waste. This means you have won the game.
You have gone through the deck (moved all of the cards from the stock to the waste) three times. This means you have lost the game.

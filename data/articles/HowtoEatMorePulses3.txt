 Dry pulses can be found in many grocery stores, super markets, and specialty food stores. Dry beans, chickpeas, peas, and lentils are inexpensive and can often be purchased in bulk. Look for seeds that are uniformly sized, brightly colored, and have smooth skins. Be sure that they do not have chips or shriveled shells. , Dry pulses can keep for several years if they are preserved in a tightly sealed container and kept in a cool, dry place. Glass containers are best for storing and preserving dry pulses.Although dry pulses can be kept for several years, it is recommended that you consume them within a year. They will become drier, smaller, and tougher over time, which will increase their overall cooking time.Store your dry beans, lentils, and peas high on a pantry shelf and away from direct sunlight. Keep the containers away from water and other liquids, and do not store on them on the floor of a pantry.
 Like dry pulses, canned pulses are inexpensive and can be purchased in grocery stores, super markets, and specialty food stores. Most markets will carry a wide variety, including chickpeas, lentils, fava beans, kidney beans, garbanzo beans, and many more. Canned pulses are pre-cooked, which makes cooking with these seeds convenient and simple., Store canned pulses in a dry, dark pantry. Canned beans, peas, and lentils will often have an expiration date listed on the can, but an unopened and intact can of pulses can last one to two years past the expiration date. If the can is dented, the pulses may be bad, but not necessarily. If the top of the can is dome-shaped and rounded, then the packaging has definitely been compromised and the contents absolutely should not be consumed.Once you have opened a can of pulses, you can store the leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to five days.

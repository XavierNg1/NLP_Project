 Multiply this by 100 to get the percentage of overhead used by each worker.


When this number is low, it means your business spends its overhead costs efficiently.
If this number is too high, you might employ too many people.
 Divide your overhead costs by the amount made in sales, then multiple by 100 to get your percentage.This is a simple way to see if you are selling enough goods/services to keep yourself in business.


Ex. If my business sells $100,000 worth of soap a month, and it costs me $10,000 to keep my office running, then I spend 10% of my revenue on overhead.
The higher this percentage, the lower your profit margin.
 Wondering why you aren't making a huge profit? You might be paying too much rent, or need to sell more products to cover overhead costs. Perhaps you have too many workers and are not spending wisely to keep them all employed. Use these percentages to take a closer look at your business model and make changes accordingly.


All businesses pay overhead, but those that manage their overhead costs wisely turn a higher profit.
That said, having low overhead isn't everything. If you spend money on good equipment or worker satisfaction, for example, you might have higher productivity and higher profits.

 Choose your prefered colour of 1 Â½ inch wide wire edge ribbon from an arts and crafts store. You will also need a pencil and needle-nose pliers., Tie a simple knot at one end of the ribbon. Gather the ribbon so that it becomes ruffled along the wire. Gather the ribbon by pinching one end of the wire and pulling the other end of the wire as you move the material of the ribbon toward where the knot is, which is the pinched end.Use your fingers to create more of a ruffle as you keep the material of the ribbon tightly gathered along the wire and fluffed out in a ruffle as you move away from the wire.
 Create a tight center around the pencil as you roll the ribbon around it. Start just after the knot and keep the knot below the roll and alongside the pencil. Once secure, remove the pencil but continue to create the rest of the rose by rolling the rest of the gathered ribbon around the center that you have created with the pencil., Secure the rose by wrapping the pulled wire around the base of the flower as tightly as you can. You should wrap the wire above the knot. Use needle-nose pliers to grasp the center of your creation as you tighten and secure the layers by twisting the wire. Use your fingers to enliven the petals by flattening and spreading the material of the ribbon to your preference.

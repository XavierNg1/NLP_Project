 The main way people add each other in Snapchat is by trading usernames. This allows you to add people that aren't in your phone's contact list. There is no way to add someone to Snapchat using an email address or real name. You'll need to ask the person what their Snapchat username is.


Note - Snapchat has two names: Display names and Usernames. The Display name is the name that appears first to other people, and can be changed, but is not used to add someone. The Username is the user's permanent account name. You'll need the Username to add someone.;
, You'll see your Snapcode, display name, username, and Snapchat score., This will open the Add Friends menu., This will open the user search.
 You cannot enter a partial username and have Snapchat finish it for you. You must type the entire username to find the person. You can only search by Snapchat username; you cannot search by real name, phone number, email address, or any other name or address.


If you want to add someone using a phone number, add them to your phone's address book first then follow the steps in the previous section.
 This will add the person to your friends list. This button will only appear if you've typed the person's entire username correctly.
 The other person may need to add you back before you can start talking to each other and send Snaps back and forth. This depends on the other person's privacy settings.

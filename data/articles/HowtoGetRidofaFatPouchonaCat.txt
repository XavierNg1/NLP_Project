 It is important to have your cat assessed before deciding on a diet and exercise regime for the cat. It is quite possible that your cat has a natural pouch that is simply part of its genetic makeup. It may also be possible that the cat has a medical condition or disease and this is something that only a qualified vet can determine.
 This means ensuring that the cat is fed appropriate food that meets its nutritional requirements at set mealtimes. Keep the quantities small, in alignment with the weight that the cat ought to be and taking into account its age, health and gender. Your vet can advise you more about this aspect, along with how many meals a day would be appropriate in the case of your cat.

Do not free feed the cat. The cat will keep on eating until the food is gone, it doesn't care about its "fat pouch"; if the food is there, the cat will eat it.
 This means playing with your cat regularly, using cat toys that cause the cat to move around a lot and chase, jump and run after. Moving toys are great because they can be chased by the cat in its own time, while a laser pointer is great fun for both you and the cat, as the cat chases it around and pounces on it.

If possible, take your cat on daily walks using a cat harness and leash. This can be done in the safety of your own yard or anywhere else that you consider to be safe for the cat. Realize that not all cats will permit this. You can try to shine a laser pointer ahead to encourage the cat to move towards it.

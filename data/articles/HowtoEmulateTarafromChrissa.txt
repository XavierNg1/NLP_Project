Make sure this is pink, purple, or anything bright because those are signature "Tara" colors. For your hair, you could put it in a french braid, a high ponytail, or just simply leave it down with a headband or barrette. Have some of your friends wear the same hairstyle too.;
, Tara loves to swim and is very, very competitive when it comes to this sport. Practice your diving, or swim laps whenever you can. Even in the winter, Tara does the indoor swim club, and in the summer, she is in the water a lot, diving and practicing different strokes.
 Tara has a posse of three girls that they like to call "The Queen Bees. (also known as the Mean Bees.) Usually, they wear something that is matching. For example, they all wear their hair in high ponytails. Make sure to talk with your friends if you would like to form a little club. If they would, try forming a name that describes you.

 Always show people that you are a girl who doesn't like to mess around with things. Sit at the "cool", crowded table, be competitive, or push boys around. Tara and her friend are known to taunt Chrissa's brother Tyler, on the bus and at swim club.

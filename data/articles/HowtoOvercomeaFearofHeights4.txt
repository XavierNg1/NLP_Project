 People are often told to face their fears by doing something that would normally terrify them. For someone suffering from a fear of heights, this could mean something like riding a roller coaster, going skydiving, or looking over the edge of a cliff. Recent research has shown that acrophobia is an innate, rather than a learned condition,which means that pushing acrophobics "in to the deep end" may have no effect at all. It may even aggravate the fear.


Further research is needed to find a definitive cause for acrophobia. Until the fear is fully understood, it is not a good idea to expose acrophobics to extreme heights without first treating the fear with therapy, medication, etc.
 If a fear of heights keeps you from working, relaxing, or doing the things you love, it's a genuine condition and not something that you should try to tolerate. "Getting tough" or "just dealing with it" aren't good strategies for living with a real phobia. You can actually create extreme stress and make poor decisions if you try to hide your fear of heights with a tough exterior.

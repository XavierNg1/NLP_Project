TracFone is a prepaid service provider, so it won’t be hard to request one. However, they will require your prepaid account to be active before they can give you an unlock code. The representative will either dictate it to you over the phone (so have a pen and paper ready) or send it to your email.;
, You can use any SIM card, either local or international, as long as it can still be detected.
 Press the Power button of your unit to shut it down. Depending on the model of your Samsung phone, you can simply pry off the back cover off the phone to reveal its back side.
 Replace the TracFone SIM card on your phone with the SIM card from another network. Replace the back cover and press the Power button to turn your unit on., Once it starts up, instead of the usual home screen, a message will be displayed notifying you that your phone needs to be unlocked first before it can use the SIM card from other networks.
 Type in the unlock code you got from the TracFone representative using either the on-screen or physical keypad (depending on the model of your Samsung phone) and press the “OK” button to enter the unlock code.
 A confirmation message will appear on your screen telling you that the unlock code has been accepted and you can now use your Samsung TracFone to other network carriers.

 You may notice that your cat rubs its face on items in your house, especially new items. The cat is leaving a scent behind when it does that. Basically, the cat is saying, "I've looked at this item, and it seems safe." When another cat approaches the item, that cat sees it as "safe." Pheromone sprays and diffusers play on this sense of safety by recreating that smell, giving your cat a sense of safety.Try using a diffuser in the room where your cat most often sees the outdoor cat. The scent should help keep your cat calm. You can find these diffusers at pet stores or online.
 In some cases, an anti-anxiety medication may be appropriate if your cat is getting very upset and aggressive. The best way to proceed is to talk to your vet and see if they think a medication is appropriate for your cat. Keep in mind that this type of medication is usually seen as a temporary solution., If your cat is still having problems, a behaviorist may be able to teach your cat coping techniques. For instance, the behaviorist may try to help your cat stay calm when it sees another cat. They may also try to calm down other aggressive behaviors, particularly those directed towards family members (both human and non-human).Ask your vet for a recommendation for a behaviorist.

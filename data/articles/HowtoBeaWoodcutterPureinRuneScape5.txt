, CHOKING IVY IS BY FAR THE FASTEST, BUT THE ONLY MONEY YOU GET IS FROM NESTS!!

Mahogany trees can be found in the Hardwood Grove by Tai Bwo Wannai (Members only). Players must pay 100 trading sticks, the currency in Tai Bwo Wannai, each time they enter the fenced-in area where the trees are. They are also found on Ape Atoll and in the Kharazi Jungle.






Magic Trees become available at level 85, and are located at Seers Village, in Mage Training Arena near Duel Arena, or near Lletya (You must complete a quest to be able to woodcut near Lletya.)






Choking ivy can be found by the yew trees south of Falador. It is found east of the south entrance of Falador.

 The last thing you want is a Jaguar leaping onto your back unexpectedly from a tree!;
, If you see a Jaguar that doesn't spot you, then don't disturb it.
 If the Jaguar spots you, avoid eye contact, this can be seen as a challenge.
 You will be viewed as prey, plus, Jaguars are faster than you.
 If the Jaguar charges at you, don't run, instead, hold your ground, wave your arms and shout, making yourself seem bigger and more dangerous than you really are.
 If the Jaguar does not stop charging, poking it in the eye or punching it on the nose could well discourage it from pressing its attack.
 The jaguar is a very unusual killer. Rather than biting the neck, it goes for the back of the head to pierce the brain and kill the prey. Protecting your head could help you survive, although this cat has very strong teeth.

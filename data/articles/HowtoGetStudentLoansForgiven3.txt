 AmeriCorps is a federal program dedicated to civic education and public service. You don’t get paid for your service, but you can defer your student loan payments while you volunteer, and after a year, you’ll be granted an award of $4,725 to pay down your student loan debt.


AmeriCorps also runs a program called Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA), which is specifically dedicated to solving the problems of homelessness, poverty, and illiteracy. The same guidelines apply for volunteering with this program: you can defer your loan payments and then qualify for $4,725 to pay down your debt.
 Teach for America is a selective program that places recent graduates in teaching positions in low-income communities. For each year that you work for Teach for America, you’ll qualify for $4,725 to pay down your student loans.
 Many employers offer help with student loan debt for new employees, so remember to ask about these programs and take advantage of them when available.
 If you become permanently disabled, you may qualify for a Total and Permanent Disability Discharge (TPD).In general, you can only qualify for TPI if you can prove that you have a medical disability that will last for at least five years or will likely result in death.
 If you took out a PLUS loan so that your child could attend school, and he or she dies, you may be able to have that debt discharged.


Contact your loan servicer for more information. In most cases, you will have to submit a copy of the death certificate directly to the lender.

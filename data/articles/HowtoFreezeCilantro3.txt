 Lay the cilantro down on a cutting board and chop it up into inch (2.54 centimeter) long pieces. You can include the stems, or leave them out. This does not have to look neat, as you will be chopping the cilantro up further in a blender.
 If you do not have a blender, you can use a food processor instead.
 If you want a more intense cilantro flavor, increase the cilantro to 2 cups (100 grams).Also, if the strong flavor of olive oil bothers you, try using another cooking oil, such as canola or vegetable.
 Make sure that the lid is secure and that there are no leaks. Keep blending until the oil turns green and the cilantro has broken up into smaller pieces. Do not blend it for too long; you still want to see bits of the herb.
 Fill each well about 3/4 of the way. Do not fill it all the way; the puree will expand when it freezes.
 Set it down on a flat, stable surface. Leave it there for a few hours to overnight.
 This way, you will be able to reuse your ice cube tray. If you do not have any freezer bags, use two regular bags instead, one inside the other.
 If you are storing other kinds of herbs in the freezer as well, consider writing "Cilantro" on the bag as well.

 A v-cutter will give the cigar smoker a bigger draw by cutting deeper into the head of the cigar. One drawback of the v-cutter is that it sometimes produces too big of a draw, making the cigar smoke too hot.A very good v-cutter will sit on a table, but is too big to carry with you. A small one is the same size as any other small cutter and can cost as little as $4.00.
A v-cutter will not remove too much from the head of the cigar, which can result in the unwrapping of the cigar.
, Take care not to wedge the head of the cigar too deep into the v-cutter, or the cut may be too big.
 Remove any loose tobacco by tapping the cigar on an ashtray or by blowing lightly into the wedge.

 You should stop letting your indoor/outdoor cat go outside if you notice signs that it’s losing its vision. All cats, especially those with vision and other health problems, are safer indoors. A cat with poor eyesight will have a harder time steering clear of threats like cars and other animals., Cats typically adapt well to vision loss by relying on their hearing, smell, and whiskers to navigate their surroundings. You should make sure it knows where its food and water bowls are located. If necessary, bring it to its food and hold its paw to feel where the bowls are set.Be sure to keep its food and water in one spot. Don’t change the location of your senior cat’s food and water.
 If your senior cat is blind or has poor eyesight, it’s best to keep it on one floor, as stairs can pose an injury risk. If your cat does move around multiple floors, keep a litter box upstairs and downstairs to prevent accidents.Senior cats often develop arthritis, so consider using litter boxes with shorter sides for easier access. Make sure your cat knows where its litter boxes are located and keep them in those locations.
 Other senses, whiskers, and memory will help your blind or vision impaired cat move around your house. However, you should do your best to make sure its environment is consistent. Avoid changing around your furniture or introducing new obstacles to your cat’s surroundings., It's easy to accidentally sneak up on a blind or visually impaired cat, so you should take steps to avoid startling it. When you approach it, call its name so it knows you're coming. Only pick it up if it knows that you're nearby and you are already interacting with it.

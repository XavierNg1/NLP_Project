 Foods that contain high amounts of water work best for freeze drying. Their structure remains intact after the process. These foods hold up particularly well:

Fruits like apples, bananas, berries, persimmons and pears.
Vegetables like potatoes, peppers, carrots, sweet potatoes and parsnips.
After you're familiar with the process, try freeze-drying chicken breasts, cheese, and even entire meals, like spaghetti and meatballs. Any food that contains moisture can be preserved using the freeze-drying process.;
, Freeze drying food at the peak of its ripeness or freshness helps make sure it will taste good when it's reconstituted.

Fruits and vegetables should be freeze dried when they are in season and fully ripe.
Meat should be freeze dried right after it has been cooked and cooled.
Full meals should be freeze dried as soon as they have been cooked and cooled. Don't freeze dry them after storing them in the refrigerator for a few days, or they'll taste like leftovers when you reconstitute them.
 Berries and apples don't need to be reconstituted - the freeze-dried version of these fruits tastes good as it is. Freeze dried meat or spaghetti, on the other hand, will need to be reconstituted with moisture in order to be edible. Don't freeze dry foods for which this won't be possible.

Bread is not a good choice for freeze drying since its texture is so dependent on freshness.
Cake, cookies and other yeast-based foods are not good candidates for freeze drying.
 Get the food ready to be preserved by doing the following:

If applicable, wash and dry the food thoroughly.
Slice the food into small pieces. Cut apples, peppers, potatoes and other fruit and vegetables into small chunks, so that the moisture is easily removed.

Cosmetic mouthwashes that don’t have any antibacterial ingredients may temporarily stop bad breath, but they don’t address the root cause of the problem.Look for mouthwashes labelled antibacterial or plaque-inhibiting that include ingredients such as cetylpyridinium chloride, thymol, eucalyptol, menthol, and methyl salicylate.;
, Use a mouthwash that contains fluoride, especially if you have dry mouth (known medically as xerostomia) or are otherwise prone to cavities. Fluoride occurs naturally in water and soil, and it’s been proven to prevent and restore tooth decay.You can find a list of recommended non-prescription fluoride rinses and mouthwashes on the American Dental Association (ADA) website., Dry mouth, or xerostomia, is a side effect of many prescription drugs and medical treatments. Avoid mouthwashes that contain alcohol if you experience dry mouth, as alcohol will worsen your condition. Choose a lubricating mouthwash labelled specifically for dry mouth that contains xylitol., Most over-the-counter whitening mouthwashes bleach teeth with hydrogen or carbamide peroxide. Both of these ingredients can cause gum and tooth irritation, and their long-term effects aren’t well studied. Avoid using whitening mouthwashes if you have sensitive teeth and gums.Stop using whitening mouthwash if you experience any burning or irritation of your teeth, gums, or oral tissues.

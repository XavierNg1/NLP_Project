 When a dog isn’t eating, oftentimes she isn’t drinking either. Dehydration is a major concern and can cause serious problems. Keep an eye on your dog to make sure she doesn’t become dehydrated. To do this, check her gums. They should be pink, wet, and slick, not dry. You can also press a finger to your dog’s gums until they change color. When you remove your finger, the color should return immediately. If it takes a few moments, the dog may be dehydrated.Dogs who are vomiting or who have diarrhea are at a high risk for dehydration.
 Never try to force water down your dog’s throat. Forcing water down her throat can cause more problems if she doesn’t swallow. Instead, try techniques to encourage her to drink on her own., If your dog has been vomiting, solid food probably will make her sicker. Give her salt-free broth or beef bouillon three to four times a day. This will help keep her hydrated while giving her needed nutrients.Homemade broth is better than canned broth., Unflavored Pedialyte, which is a drink for children containing electrolytes, can help your dog if she has not been eating or drinking. The Pedialyte can help replace much needed electrolytes., Sometimes, you can get your dog to lick a wet surface so she can get some water. See if your dog will lick water from your hand or fingers. You can also try to see if your dog will lick an ice cube., Sometimes, adding an ice cube to your dog’s water can help. She might be more willing to drink it with the ice cube inside, which makes the water cooler.Some pets like to drink running water instead of still water, so also try a drinking fountain to encourage your dog to drink., Dehydration can cause serious problems. If your dog refuses to drink anything, take her to the vet. The vet can give her fluids through an IV and find out if there is an underlying condition.

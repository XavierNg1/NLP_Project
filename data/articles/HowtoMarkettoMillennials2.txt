 Studies have shown that millennials seem to trust user-generated content more than content created by marketers. Thus, try to use user-generated content in your advertising campaigns whenever you can.


Take advantage of Instagram, Snapchat, and other services to gather and channel user-generated content into your marketing campaign. For instance, you may set up a “selfie” contest and have users submit their own selfie with your product. Use submitted selfies in future ad campaigns.
Use the wiki approach to gather user-generated content.
Create channels that users and others can contribute to your marketing campaign., As a group that are very in-tune to their peers' opinions and tastes, millennials are very interested in user created review videos. They see these videos as authentic and honest.


Hire millennials to review your product.
Create videos based on these reviews.
Keep the videos short and packed with information.
Consider creating an “unboxing” video of your product, in which a millennial opens the product and explains the virtues of the product., Guerilla marketing is a type of marketing that is relatively low-cost and focuses on unconventional approaches to promoting a product. This approach is often distributed and comes across as organic to the consumer. Millennials, as a group, have been shown to be very open to guerrilla marketing.


Hire someone to demonstrate or show off your product in very public areas. For instance, create a giant coffee cup and have someone give samples of coffee on a busy public street.
Provide branding stickers in your products. If someone likes your product a lot, they might put the sticker on the back of their car or elsewhere. Apple and the maker of Yeti products have successfully used this marketing approach.

 Call blocking for landlines is a carrier-side feature. To enable it, you'll need to contact your phone carrier and see what options are available to you.
 This feature will allow you to reject private and blocked calls. The feature may cost extra, depending on your carrier.
 Most carriers allow you to block specific numbers if you're getting harassed by someone. The process varies depending on your carrier.


For example, if you have AT&T or Verizon home phone service, you can dial *60 and then add follow the spoken instructions to a number to your block list.
 This feature may allow you to change your phone's ring for certain numbers, allowing you to determine if you want to answer it.

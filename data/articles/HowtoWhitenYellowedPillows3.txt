 To keep your pillows in prime working condition, change your pillowcases and bedding at least once per week. If the bed’s owner is prone to sweating, bedwetting, or wearing makeup to bed, change the sheets and pillowcases twice per week.Keep at least two sets of sheets on hand--one on your bed, and one at the ready when laundry day rolls around. Regularly rotating your sheets will keep your mattress and pillows clean, and will help your sheets last longer.
 To keep your pillow smelling fresh and clean, use linen spray in between washes. Many linen sprays are made from safe, fresh ingredients such as witch hazel or essential oils, many of which can be tailored to suit your preferences. A quality linen spray will keep mold and mildew at bay.Linen sprays can double as sleep aids; a spray using lavender or cedarwood oil, for instance, may help you relax and get to sleep.
 Some experts recommend machine-washing your pillows every 3 months, but all agree that pillows should go no longer than 5-6 months before getting a thorough cleaning. Washing your pillows regularly will help prevent yellowing and buildup.The number of times you clean your pillows will, again, depend on your body’s natural composition and your sleep habits. If you are prone to sweating during the night, your pillows will need more frequent washings.
If you often go to sleep without cleaning your face and hair, you may need to wash your pillows even more frequently, such as every two months.
 Although you do not have to shower each and every night, quickly washing your face and brushing your hair will help prolong the life of your pillows and pillowcases. Many cosmetic ingredients are harsh and can not only discolor fabric, but also break fabric down.Sweat and oils from your face and hair are inevitable, but their effects can be minimized with a simple cleaning routine each night. Even doing something as simple as splashing water on your face and tying your hair back can extend your pillows’ life.

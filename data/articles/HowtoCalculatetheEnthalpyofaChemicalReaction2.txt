 Nearly all chemical reactions involve forming or breaking bonds between atoms. Since, in a chemical reaction, energy can be neither destroyed nor created, if we know the energy required to form or break the bonds being made (or broken) in the reaction, we can estimate the enthalpy change for the entire reaction with high accuracy by adding up these bond energies.


For example, let's consider the reaction H2 + F2 → 2HF. In this case, the energy required to break the H atoms in the H2 molecule apart is 436 kJ/mol, while the energy required for F2 is 158 kJ/mol.Finally, the energy needed to form HF from H and F is = -568 kJ/mol.We multiply this by 2 because the product in the equation is 2HF, giving us 2 × -568 = -1136 kJ/mol. Adding these all up, we get:
436 + 158 + -1136 = -542 kJ/mol.
 Enthalpies of formation are set ∆H values that represent the enthalpy changes from reactions used to create given chemicals. If you know the enthalpies of formation required to create products and reactants in an equation, you can add them up to estimate the enthalpy much as you would with bond energies as described above.


For example, let's consider the reaction C2H5OH + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O. In this case, we know the enthalpies of formation for the following reactions:C2H5OH → 2C + 3H2 + 0.5O2 = 228 kJ/mol
2C + 2O2 → 2CO2 = -394 × 2 = -788 kJ/mol
3H2 + 1.5 O2 → 3H2O = -286 × 3 = -858 kJ/mol
Since we can add these equations up to get C2H5OH + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O, the reaction we're trying to find the enthalpy for, we can simply add up the enthalpies of the formation reactions above to find the enthalpy of this reaction as follows:
228 + -788 + -858 = -1418 kJ/mol.
 It's important to note that when you use enthalpies of formation to calculate the enthalpy of a reaction, you need to reverse the sign of the enthalpy of formation whenever you reverse the equation of the component reaction. In other words, if you have to turn one or more of your formation reaction equations backwards in order to get all of your products and reactants to cancel properly, reverse the sign on the enthalpies of the formation reactions you had to flip.


In the example above, notice that the formation reaction we use for C2H5OH is backwards. C2H5OH → 2C + 3H2 + 0.5O2 shows C2H5OH breaking down, not being formed. Because we turned the equation around in order to get all of the products and reactants to cancel properly, we reversed the sign on the enthalpy of formation to give us 228 kJ/mol. In reality, the enthalpy of formation for C2H5OH is -228 kJ/mol.

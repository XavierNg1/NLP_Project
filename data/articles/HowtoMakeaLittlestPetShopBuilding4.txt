, They can go up or sit side-by-side.

 This will make the LPS house a home for the LPS pets. Here are just a few simple ideas:

Shelf: Use a square piece of cardboard and fold a tiny tab at the top. Glue the tab to the wall.






Bed: Use a rectangular piece of cardboard on top of a rectangular piece of foam or Styrofoam. Cover with scrap fabric to make a mattress. Add scrap fabric sheets and duvet, plus a pillow or two. Pillows can be made by wrapping fabric around cotton balls and gluing in place.






Computer: Fold a small piece of paper over a small wooden block or a square of thick cardboard. Cover with white paper. Draw a screen on the top. Make a rectangular piece of cardboard for the keyboard. Cover in white paper, then draw little keys onto it. For fun, use a small Lego or similar mouse as the computer "mouse".






Rugs: Cut out rug images from magazines or print-outs; use scraps of fabric; use carpet offcuts, etc.

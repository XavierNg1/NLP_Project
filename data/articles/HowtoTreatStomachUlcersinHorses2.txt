 This will ensure that no reflux of acid will reach the non-glandular part of the stomach. During exercise and training, a lot of acids are refluxed, because exercise puts pressure on the stomach. Rapid movement that occurs during training can also cause acids in the stomach to splash. The stomach contains rapidly dividing cells. Resting the horse will ensure that the damaged lining will be repaired.
 Horse stomachs secrete acid in a cyclical fashion. This means that the acidity will increase and decrease throughout the day--sometimes a horse’s stomach will have a pH of 5 or it can drop to as low as a pH of 1. When a horse has hay 24/7, his stomach will always be full. Hay causes the horse to chew more, thus creating more saliva; saliva protects against strong acids.


The chewed hay will float in the horse’s stomach and will form a protective layer that prevents the reflux of acids into the non-glandular part of the stomach.
Roughage like alfalfa hay, for example, contain a lot of substances that act as antacids like calcium, magnesium sulfate, saponins, and mucilage proteins.
 After you have let your horse rest for a week, you can begin to reintroduce him to exercise. Thirty minutes before the exercise, feed him small amounts of alfalfa hay or 500 grams of alfalfa chaff. The alfalfa will create an alkaline layer that blocks acid splashing into the upper non-glandular section of the stomach.

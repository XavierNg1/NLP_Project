 Tape the fingerprints on a notecard or a white sheet of paper. Record each family member’s name, birthday, and gender.


You can catalogue one finger or all ten if you’d like. If you record all ten fingers, it will be easier to identify found prints.
 Fingerprints come in three categories: arch, loop, and whirl. These patterns are found in the lines from the fingerprints. An arch looks like a short bump. A loop looks like a long, thin arch. A whirl resembles a circle surrounded by smaller lines. These classifications are important when identifying fingerprints.


Write the fingerprint classification for each family member on their fingerprint card.
The different shapes can also lean left or right.If so, indicate which direction the whirl, loop, or arch leans on the family members fingerprint card.
 When you find fingerprints around the house, compare them to your catalogue. Look for matching classification and tilt. For example, if the fingerprint you found was a whirl that leaned to the left, you would look through your catalogue for a similarly identified print.


Store successfully identified fingerprints on the back of their respective fingerprint card. This will make future identifications easier.

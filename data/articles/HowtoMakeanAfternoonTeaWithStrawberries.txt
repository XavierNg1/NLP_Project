 Invite the people you want to come using an invitation shaped like a strawberry or featuring strawberry images. If emailing the invitations, include lots of strawberry designs.;
, If you can, use plates with strawberry designs on them. Check auction sites or thrift stores for possibilities. Add strawberry decorations, either purchased or handmade, to the table and anywhere else that you can decorate.


Look for napkins or serviettes with strawberry designs on them and even a tablecloth with strawberries.
If you have strawberries in containers, place some of these on or near the table.
Use fresh bowls of strawberries as both decorative features and food at one and the same time.
 This will be a centerpiece feature for the afternoon tea. If the cups accompanying it also have strawberry designs, even better!

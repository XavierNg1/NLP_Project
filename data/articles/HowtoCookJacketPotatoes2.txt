 Use a vegetable brush to scrub the potato skins thoroughly to remove any dirt. Since you won't be peeling the potatoes, it's important to get the jackets clean. Dry the potatoes thoroughly.
 Make 8 to 12 holes all over the potatoes. This will allow moisture to escape during the cooking process. If you skip this step, they may burst in the microwave.
 Rub the jackets with olive oil and sprinkle them with salt. This will bring out the flavor of the skins. You can skip this step if you don't like to eat the jackets.
 Place them all in a single layer.
 The top half of the potatoes will cook and grow soft.
 After three minutes, poke the potatoes to see if they're done. If they're still stiff in the middle, microwave in one-minute increments until they're completely soft., Slit each one in half lengthwise. Use a fork to fluff the potatoes. Top with butter, salt and pepper, cheese, and any other ingredients that pair well with potatoes.

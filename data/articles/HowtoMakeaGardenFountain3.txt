 You'll need a pain with a downspout, a water can, and a large metal tub. You'll also need a pump, 1/2" tubing, a wooden wedge, something to drill or puncture the metal with, and silicon or Sugru.
 Puncture a 1/2" hole in the side of the metal tub and insert the tubing through it. Attach the tubing to the pump and then seal off the hole with Sugru and/or silicon so that it is watertight.


This punctured hole should be very close to the bottom of the tub.
 Puncture a similar 1/2" hole in the side of pail thread the end of the tubing through it so that the tube ends in the pail and seal the hole similarly to how you sealed the tub.
 Arrange the containers on steps, ledges, or boxes so that the downspout on the pail flows into the watering can and the watering can pours into the tub. The watering can will need the wedge underneath to make it pour.
 Ta-da! Your garden fountain is done! You can add as many pails and watering cans as you want to the chain.

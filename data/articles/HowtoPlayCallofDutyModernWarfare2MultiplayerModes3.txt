 Now, we will look at Domination. Domination is sort of like "Capture the Flag." In this mode, there are two teams and three checkpoints on the map. When a person dies, they can respond instantly. To earn points, a team has to "capture the flag" by standing close to the checkpoint for a certain amount of time, and then holds it without letting the other team capture that point. For every 5 seconds that a team holds a checkpoint, they earn a point. A team wins by accumulating 200 total points. There are two strategies on how to approach this mode. One would be to try to run around and capture as many checkpoints as possible for your team without worrying about killing the enemy team members. This can help your team dominate the checkpoints and earn the points required to win. Another strategy would be to hide near a checkpoint that your team has already captured and wait for the enemy team to try to capture that checkpoint, and then kill the enemy team members. This can help your team prevent your captured checkpoints from been lost to the enemy. The video above shows a player who uses the first strategy of running around trying to capture all the flags for his team without worrying about killing and deaths. We can see that after his team capture flags, the points on the bottom right of the screen start going up every five seconds.

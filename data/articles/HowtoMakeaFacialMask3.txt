 Acne tends to pop up during stressful times of life. This face mask soothes inflamed skin and includes essential oil to calm your mind, too. Take a trip to the grocery store for the following ingredients:


Lemon juice, which has astringent properties and tones your face. Buy a fresh lemon and squeeze the juice; pre-squeezed juice may have preservatives that are hard on your sensitive facial skin.
Honey, which softens the skin and eases inflammation.
Egg white, which brightens and tones skin.
Lavender or rosemary essential oil.
 Place a tablespoon of lemon juice, a tablespoon of honey, one egg white, and a few drops of essential oil in a bowl. Use a spoon or a whisk to stir until the ingredients are completely incorporated.









This mask is made with perishable ingredients, so any extra mask mixture should be stored in the refrigerator in a jar with a lid.
You only need a couple of drops of essential oil; a little goes a long way.
 Smooth a liberal amount of the mixture over your face, gently applying it to the areas where you have acne. Don't rub or scrub it into your face, since you risk inflaming your skin even more. Let the mask sit on your face for 15 minutes.
 Use lukewarm or cool water to rinse away the mask, then pat your face dry with a soft towel. Apply an oil-free moisturizer to finish.

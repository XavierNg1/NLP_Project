 If you are travelling at the speed limit, or going with the flow, slow down slightly and look for the first opportunity to move out of the way of the tailgater so they can pass you safely. The only place where you want a tailgater to be is in front of you. If you are on a two-lane road where passing is permissible and you're already going as fast as you are comfortable going, slow down and encourage the tailgater to pass. Waving someone forward to pass you is generally considered acceptable on country roads.
If you slow down gradually, the tailgater will respond by slowing down as well. This way if something unexpected happens in the road, and the tailgater hits you, the accident will be much less severe because the momentum will be lower and they will hit you with much less force.;
, In most places, faster traffic moves in the inner lanes (the "fast lanes") and slower traffic in the outer lanes (the "slow lanes"). Moving to this lane will also give you a chance to pull off onto the shoulder (if one is available) in case you need to pull out of traffic completely.However, if you pull off the road and the tailgater does the same, pull back on the road and find a populated area (like a shopping mall or a rest area) to pull off at. People have been robbed because they were hit by a tailgater and pulled off in the middle of nowhere. Always be cautious and safe when pulling off of the roadway.
 If you notice that the route you take to get wherever you're going is a constant source for tailgating or other road rage, it might be safer to find another way to go, not to mention much less stressful.Try taking city streets instead of congested highways when possible. Tailgating is more common on busy highway roads and interstates where people can drive at faster speeds.

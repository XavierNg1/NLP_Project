 Well-made tea lasts longer. It has undergone high heat fixation process that kills tea enzymes. It should be dried to to 2% to 3% moisture level.;
, The best green tea is harvested from February to April. Buy early spring and enjoy them for the rest of the year.
 Make sure your vendor uses a heat sealed polyfoil laminate. It is the only air-tight container. Other containers such as polythene bags, Ziploc bags and tea tins are not truly airtight.
 Once you open your sealed pouch, store in a cool, dark cupboard, in a part of the house where temperature is fairly even. Temperature change can induce water inside the tea container.
 As your container is not likely to be truly airtight, try to consume it as soon as possible, preferably within 2 months.
 Unopened pouches may be stored in a fridge or freezer. Temperature cycles can cause ice crystals and "freezer burn" to form. The ideal fridge is a chest freezer, as cold air stays below when the lid is opened. Insulate pouches in a box.
 Wait for it to warm to room temperature before opening. This will prevent air moisture from condensing.
 Once you have opened your sealed pouches, do not keep them in a freezer. This is because the tea will be somewhat damp, and re-freezing and the subsequent thawing will dampen it even further.

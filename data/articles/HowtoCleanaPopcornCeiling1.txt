 A vacuum cleaner provides a way to suck up the cobwebs without rubbing the delicate popcorn texture. Choose a handheld vacuum with a hose extension that reaches the ceiling. For high ceilings, you’ll need a ladder. Point the vacuum and let its force suck away stubborn cobwebs., When you don’t have the right vacuum cleaner, a feather duster will do. Use a feather duster on a pole extension or climb up with a ladder. Move the duster under each cobweb and lift it away so it doesn’t leave marks.


Remember to clean the cobwebs off the duster before you use it again so they don’t leave marks elsewhere.
 Get non-sticky lint roller tubes from the store. These can be used to replace paint rollers heads that work with extension handles. Tape the ends of the rollers to protect the walls. Roll over the ceiling, then throw away whatever webbing comes down. Replace the tape as the webs stick to it.

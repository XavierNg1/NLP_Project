 With a recent boom in blogging has come a boom in blogging help - including creating a personalized blog signature. If you don’t want you actual signature online or lack graphic design skills, you can visit a website that will generate dozens of signature options for you. Simply visit a signature-creation site (such as Signature Makeror Sign Now), and follow the step-by-step directions to create your e-signature., If you’re big into graphic design, put your talents to use and create a personalized signature for your blog in your favorite photo-editing/graphic design program. Use the assortment of fonts that come with your program, or try your hand at drawing your signature electronically. This can then be saved as an image, and uploaded at the end of every blog post in a custom size.
 Although you may not want your real signature floating around the internet, you can draw an attractive version of your signature on paper and scan it onto your computer. This can then be downloaded onto a photo-editing software on your computer, edited to make more clear, and then uploaded as an image to your blog.


Some phone’s offer apps that take scanner-like images for your blog or to save onto your computer.
 If you don’t want to have to deal with adding your signature manually to the end of each blog post, you can add a bit of code which will do all the work for you. Copy and paste: <img class="left" alt="post signature" src="YOUR IMAGE URL"> in the post template for your blog.

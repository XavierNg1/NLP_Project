 Remember that you'll be drawing a bunny, not a human, so create an initial sketch or perhaps look at a sketch of a rabbit which someone else has done which is similar to the type of picture you aim to draw and pay attention to the proportions and the shape of the legs.;
,, This is a good time to also fill in detail to the ears.
, Round out the legs if you haven't done so already.
 Consider drawing clothes, eggs, or a basket to your bunny.
 Use anything you like (for example, ink or paint). Wait a few moments and erase all the unnecessary pencil guidelines.
 Add gradients or texture as you see fit.

 Don't get too carried away, however; choose about 3 to 5 blingy items to use as your statement pieces. Brooches, cabochons, and scrapbooking embellishments (such as resin roses) work especially well for this. Choose pieces that go well together, or your phone case will look too cluttered.Use pliers to break off the backs from clip-on earrings, stud earrings, or brooches.
 Arrange the pieces on your phone case, but don't glue them down yet. Again, do not get carried away; you will be filling in the negative space with smaller pearls and rhinestones. Do not cover up any of the holes for the camera, buttons, or microphone., Choose a strong, industrial-strength glue, such as E6000. Pick up one of your embellishments, and squeeze out some glue onto the back. Press the embellishment back into place on the case. Do this for all of the pieces.You can also apply some glue to the case itself, then press the piece into it.
 Squeeze out some of your glue onto a disposable tray or lid. Use a pair of jewelry tweezers to pick up a rhinestone/pearl. Dip the back into the glue, then press it onto the phone case. Fill the rest of your case in a similar manner.Buy rhinestones/pearls that come in a variety of sizes.
Start with the bigger ones first and finish with the smallest.
 Industrial-strength glue typically has both a drying time and a curing time. This can take anywhere between 24 and 72 hours. Check the label on your tube of glue for more specific drying times.

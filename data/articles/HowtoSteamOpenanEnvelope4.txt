 If you are trying to steam open an envelope, you probably want to know how to go about re-sealing it again. First of all wait for the glue melted by the steam to cool and re-gain it's stickiness.
 The first thing to try is simply licking the adhesive strips and closing the envelope as you would normally. The glue should have re-gained it's tackiness and you should be able just press it closed.


Bear in mind that you may have to hold the strip down for a little longer than usual to get it to stick.
 Another way to reseal the envelope is to put the adhesive side of the flap back in the steam briefly. Get your water back to the boil and hold your envelope over the boiling water for around twenty seconds.
 While you hold it over the water, run your finger along the adhesive strip to close it down. Be careful not to crease it or allow too much stream to wet the envelope.
 Now remove the envelope from above the water and place down on a table or surface and apply pressure to the adhesive strip. You may have to hold it down for thirty seconds or so, or you could put something heavy like a book on top of it. Soon it should be re-seal and ready to go.


If it does not all reseal on the first try put it back in the steam briefly and press it together lightly. Make sure not to rub the envelope, because when it is damp it may rub and tear.
 If all else fails, donâ€™t panic! You can use some Elmer's glue, but make sure that you spread it around very well so that it looks like a normal envelope. You don't want to have some areas with glue marks staining the envelope, or soggy gluey patches. A light even covering should do the trick.

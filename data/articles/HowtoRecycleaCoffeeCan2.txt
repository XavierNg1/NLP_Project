 Coffee cans can also make inexpensive and elegant cubbies for holding pencils, office supplies, knitting supplies, and anything else you can think of. To tailor the aesthetic impact of your coffee can cubby, remove the label and paint the can your desired color.
 If you want to build an entire storage rack from the coffee cans (for example, for storing many skeins of yarn), you can attach them together. You can glue the sides of each coffee can to the next using a hot glue gun. Coffee can cubbies assembled in this way can even be mounted on the wall.
 These cubbies are great for storing pencils, pens, and scissors on a desktop. They are also excellent for storing knitting needles or yarn and for organizing paperclips, staples, and other small office supplies. They can even be used in the kitchen to organize different kinds of teabags or individual packs of sweeteners.

 You will do better on your test if you are well rested. If you are sleepy, you will have difficulty thinking and will be more forgetful. If you are a teenager, you need between 8-10 hours of sleep a night.If you are between the ages of 6 and 13, you need 9-11 hours of sleep each night.Cramming for the test the night before won't help you. It is better to relax and get a good night's sleep instead.
Adjust your schedule the week of the test so you can get enough rest.;
, Don't spend the night before your test worrying about it. Do an activity that you enjoy and that will take your mind off of things. Spend time with your friends or family, watch a movie, play video games, or read a magazine that is not school related.


You will do better on the test if you are relaxed and in a good mood.
 You do not want to be in a rush the morning of your test. This can cause you to feel even more nervous and anxious. Pack your school bag the night before with everything you will need for the day.


Make sure you have all necessary materials for the test, including pencils and erasers.
 Wake up early enough to eat a nutritious breakfast. Food is necessary to fuel your brain. If you take your test without eating, you will be more distracted and have problems concentrating. Do not experiment or try any new foods the day of your test either.Good breakfast choices include fruit, whole grain-cereal, and protein rich foods (e.g. eggs, nuts, and yogurt).
Stay away from processed and sugary foods such as cookies, cakes, etc. Also avoid eating a carbohydrate (e.g. bread, pancakes, etc.) heavy breakfast because it will cause you to feel sluggish and sleepy.
If you do not feel like eating in the morning, try having a smoothie or a breakfast shake.

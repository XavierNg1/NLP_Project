 The ledger board connects the deck to the house. It bears the deck’s weight. You may need to go under the deck to get a good look at it. Make sure the board is secure to the house. If the screws and bolts are loose or the board is separated, tighten the bolts.The board needs to be held by ½-inch (12.7 mm) steel screws and bolts rather than nails. Nails are not strong enough.
 Look once over all screws, bolts, and plating that holds the pieces of the deck together. Go back and reexamine any that you skipped. Look for signs of rust, warping, separation, or locations where the deck is held only by nails and make repairs so the deck holds strong.Steel screws and bolts are most resistant to water but will rust eventually.
Nails alone are not strong enough to hold together a deck and should be supplemented with other fasteners.
 If your deck has a staircase, walk up and down it. Press on the railings to see if they feel stable. The staircase should not wobble. Repair any damaged wood pieces and bolts.

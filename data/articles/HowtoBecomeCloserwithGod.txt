 Patience is a virtue. Jesus, Buddha, Gandhi, they were all patient with people, even if people weren't patient with them. Whenever you express patience towards others, keep in mind that your intention is mainly to become closer to God.;
, Be sure to thank God for the good things in your life, and don't just pray for your own good, pray for others as well! At the very least keep praying just to keep connected with God.
 Keep in mind whether or not they were written by man or God. Use interpretation to decide what you feel like God wants you to do.
 Try your best to be the best you can be, and if you do sin, always repent, if that is a ritual included in your religion. Your friends will appreciate you being nice to people, as will your God.
 If your religion has laws for how to behave, then follow these laws faithfully.
 Even when Jesus was sent to die a horrible death on the cross, he still felt no hate for anyone. When Musa (A.S.) was sent to visit the Pharaoh, Allah encouraged him to be kind and polite despite the Pharaoh's atrocities. Thus, a major theme in most religions is love.
 They say that every week, a church has a message for someone there, even if it may not be for you.
 This is the most important step. Contemplate on the great and amazing things that God has done and still does, and your spirituality will soar!

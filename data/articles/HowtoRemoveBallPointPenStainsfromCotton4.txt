 Gel ink manufacturers all confess that removing gel ink can be difficult, if not impossible, due to the highly-pigmented nature of the ink. Your best bet is to get the stain out as quickly as possible using an all-purpose cleaner. Add a small amount of your normal detergent, stain removal gel, or even liquid hand soap directly to the stain, and rinse thoroughly with running water. Then try to blot out any remaining ink by pressing the fabric between two absorbent cloths, or stacks of napkins or paper towels., Dissolve 1 teaspoon of household ammonia in warm water. Soak the garment in the ammonia solution for 1 hour. Rinse thoroughly, then hand-wash with your normal detergent, scrubbing the stain with a soft brush, if needed.If the stain is responding to this treatment, repeat as needed until the ink is gone, and launder as usual.
If the ink is not coming out, continue on to the next step.
NEVER mix ammonia with chlorine bleach.
 Mix 1 cup of rubbing alcohol with cup of vinegar. Place the garment on a clean dry towel, and apply the solution to the stained area with a rag or a spray bottle until the fabric is thoroughly saturated. Allow the solution to soak in for at least 5 minutes, then pour a small amount of table salt over the stained area. Wait 10 more minutes, and then scrub the stain with a soft brush, and rinse with hot water.


If this method removed some, but not all of the ink, repeat until the stain is gone.
 Gel ink formulas differ, and while some simply can't be removed, others may respond to alternative treatment options. If the above methods didn't work, you can always try the methods for removing ballpoint or rollerball ink. Just make sure to rinse the garment very thoroughly between experiments to avoid mixing chemicals. You might get lucky, or you might have to learn to live with your newly-enhanced garment.

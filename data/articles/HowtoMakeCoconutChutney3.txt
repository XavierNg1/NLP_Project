 Place 1/3 cup (35 g) of packed grated coconut, 1/2 tablespoon of the chopped shallots or pearl onions, 2 to 3 chopped dried red chilies, 1/2 inch of fresh peeled ginger and 1/4 cup ( of water in a small food processor or spice grinder. Close the lid and grind the ingredients until you have a smooth paste.If you want a more savory flavor, you can substitute 2 cloves of garlic for the fresh ginger.
 Scoop the base mixture into a small heat-proof bowl using a spoon or spatula. You can put the base in a tempered glass bowl or a steel bowl. Taste the mixture and add salt according to your taste. The mixture should be a pasty orange color.If the mixture is too thick or chunky, stir in another tablespoon or two of water to help smooth it out.
 Heat 1 tablespoon of coconut oil in a small deep pan on the stove over medium-high heat. When the oil starts shimmering, add 1/2 a teaspoon of mustard seeds to the oil. When you hear the mustard seeds crackle, add 1/2 a teaspoon of urad dal. Cook this seasoning until it turns golden.The oil may sputter so stand away from the pan and use long utensils and oven mitts when handling the seasoning.
 Add 8 to 10 curry leaves and the remaining tablespoon of chopped shallots or pearl onions directly into the tempering seasoning and oil in your pan. Let these ingredients fry in the tempering seasoning until the shallots or onions turn golden brown.The curry leaves should also crisp up as they cook.
 Carefully hold your pot of tempering seasonings and oil while wearing oven mitts. Slowly pour the mixture over your red coconut curry base in the heat-proof bowl. Take a spoon and stir the mixtures together. Serve the Kerala-style red coconut chutney immediately.The oil may separate from the coconut chutney, but just stir it again to combine.

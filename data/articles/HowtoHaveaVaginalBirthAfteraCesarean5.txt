 Childbearing women with a history of a prior cesarean are given the option to labor for a VBAC or to schedule a repeat cesarean. Women should be informed of all of the risks involved with both procedures as well as all of the benefits before making a final decision.



It would be very beneficial to both you and the baby to begin eating a healthy and nourishing diet.
Keep yourself fit with daily physical activity.
Get plenty of rest.
Keep all doctor appointments to ensure good prenatal care.
Avoid stressful situations when possible.
 Unforeseen complications are a factor with any birth and may have nothing to do with your attempt at a VBAC. Umbilical or placenta problems, preeclampsia, breech positioning or unprogressive labor often require an emergency cesarean.
 To date, there have been less than 0.01% of deaths to mothers due to uterine rupture. Proper prenatal care, trained VBAC birth attendants, careful monitoring of labor and quick response to a uterine rupture usually result in mother and baby doing well. Fetal death due to either VBAC or repeat cesarean is very rare.
 It happens swiftly while laboring or delivering. Some studies have shown that fetal monitoring electronically may be helpful in detecting a uterine rupture.
 Know the directions to your nearest hospitals. Be sure the hospital is equipped to handle an emergency. Make certain that there will be emergency newborn care.

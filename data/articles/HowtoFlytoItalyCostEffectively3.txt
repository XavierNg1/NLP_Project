 Charters to Italy are not readily available in some areas of the world, and those that do operate are often out of a normal travelerâ€™s price range. An agent can set you up with other people who are looking to make a similar trip, thereby facilitating the process more quickly than having to do the legwork yourself.
 Even though the agent can help you find other passengers, you can still help move things along by locating others who would be willing to join you on the flight. The more passengers you can recruit, the lower the cost of the charter will be.
 Make sure you have the proper identification, as you will likely face customs and border inspection upon your arrival in Italy.

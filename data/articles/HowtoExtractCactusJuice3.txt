 Use lukewarm or cool water and scrub them clean with a vegetable brush.
 Cut off approximately 1/2 inch (1.27 centimeters) from both ends of the fruit, essentially removing just enough to cut away the skin and expose the inner flesh.
 Use a sharp, heavy knife. The slit should only cut halfway into the fruit instead of the entire way through, and it should extend from the top end of the fruit straight through to the bottom end.
 Fill the pot with enough water to cover the fruit by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Bring the water to boil over high heat.
 The fruit needs to simmer until the interior becomes soft and mushy. This may take between 45 and 60 minutes. Check the softness of the interior by inserting a fork through the slit. If it is still hard, continue to simmer it in 10 minute intervals until it softens.
 Allow it to cool to room temperature before attempting to handle it.
 Cut into the slit, slicing the fruit through to the other side.
 It should be soft enough to remove with a spoon by this point. Place the pulp, seeds and all, into the center of a large square of cheesecloth.
 Knot or twist the ends into a tight bundle to prevent any pulp from escaping through the top. Hold the cheesecloth over a large bowl.
 Squeeze the bundle of cactus pulp through the cheesecloth, pushing in a downward motion to direct the juice out through the bottom of the cloth and into the bowl below. Continue squeezing until juice no longer drips from the bottom of the cloth.

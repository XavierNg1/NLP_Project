 In addition to basic soldering equipment and wires, you'll need the following components:


470Î¼f capacitor
Micro motor
3 volt solar cell;
, If you have not tried this before, review the basics of soldering electronics. You'll need to solder two connections:


Solder a red wire to the positive pin of the solar cell
Solder a black wire to the ground pin of the solar cell

, Now it's time to add the capacitor, so it can store a charge from the solar cell:

Connect the positive pin of the capacitor to the positive wire of solar cell.
Connect the negative pin of the capacitor to the negative wire of the solar cell.
 Attach the motor to the solar cell so it can draw power:


Connect the positive wire of the motor to the positive pin of the solar cell.
Connect the negative wire of the motor to the negative pin of the solar cell.
 The motor will start spinning once light hits the solar panel.
 Photons from the light source hit the electrons in the solar cell, causing it to produce power (a continual supply of energy). The capacitor stores up enough energy to get the motor started, and smooths the output of the solar cell. The motor is a solenoid (a coil of wire) around a metal core, surrounded by two magnets. The energy passing through the solenoid temporarily magnetizes the core, so that the magnets cause it to spin.

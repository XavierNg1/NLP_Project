 Snap open each fava bean pod and pop the individual beans out of the shell.

Locate the string/stem side of the pod. Snap the tip, peeling the string away in the process.
Continue peeling away the string down the length of the pod until you reach the very end, then use your fingers to pry open the pod along the newly exposed seam.
Pluck the individual beans out of the pod using your fingers. Most mature pods will contain four to eight beans.;
, Bring 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water to a boil in a small saucepan, then place a steamer basket over the top of the pan.

Ideally, the steamer basket should be wide enough to fit the beans in a single layer.
Make sure that the boiling water does not touch the bottom of the steamer basket. Only the steam should be allowed to reach the basket.
 Toss the beans into the basket. Cover the steamer and gently cook the beans for 30 to 60 seconds, or until the outer coating of each bean starts to shrivel.Once the coating shrivels, you should remove the basket of beans from the steamer and allow them to cool for several minutes, just until they are cool enough to handle with your bare hands.
 Peel away the shriveled skin from each fava bean.

Carefully pinch the end of each bean, grabbing the skin without grabbing the bean itself. The inner bean should pop out when you do this.
Keep the inner beans and discard the waxy coatings.
 Return the beans to the steamer basket, and return the steamer basket to your saucepan of boiling water. Cover and continue steaming until the beans are tender.The exact amount of time will depend on how large the individual beans are. Check the beans for doneness every 5 minutes or so. Even with large beans, the process should not take longer than 15 minutes.
 Transfer the cooked beans to a serving bowl. Toss with melted butter (or olive oil), salt, and black pepper. Enjoy the beans while they're still hot.

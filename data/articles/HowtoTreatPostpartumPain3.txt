 Breastfeeding is healthy for your baby and will improve your breast pain. Sore breasts after delivery are caused by engorgement – milk being produced in your breasts. Breastfeed to help alleviate the pressure and ease pain.You can also use a breast pump to express milk.
 Apply warm compresses to your breasts to alleviate some pain from engorgement. This can help release milk. Use clean washcloths or towels every time so you don’t introduce bacteria to your breasts and nipples. You can also soak in a hot bath, or stand in a hot shower., When you’re not feeding, put cold packs, bags of ice, or cool washcloths on your breasts to relieve some discomfort. Wrap ice in towels so you don’t damage your skin., If you’re not breastfeeding, take measures to minimize your milk production. This will alleviate breast soreness. Wear firm, supportive bras like a sports bra.


Don’t rub your breasts or use a breast pump – this will encourage more milk production.
 If you’re experiencing pain during breastfeeding, a lactation specialist can teach you techniques to make breastfeeding more comfortable. They can also help you watch out for any problems you might encounter while breastfeeding (like mastitis).

 Pregnancy only lasts 72 Sim hours in The Sims 3. If you hear music while the Sims are trying to conceive a baby, they succeeded.You can also tell if your female Sim is pregnant if you press "Go Here" and you have no options like "Run" or "Walk.";
, Although unconfirmed, there's a rumor that Story Progression tries to keep your town's gender ratio balanced.In other words, if your town has more women than men, the game might force the next baby to be male. It's worth turning this off in the Game Options menu, just in case.
 According to the Prima strategy guide, eating three apples during pregnancy makes it very likely that the baby will be a boy. This does not guarantee it completely, but it's the closest you can get without downloading a mod.


To be extra safe, some people recommend three apples each trimester (first, second, and third day of pregnancy).However, others have said that more than three won't increase your chances.
 This works the same way in the other direction. Have the pregnant Sim eat at least three watermelons to make the chance of conceiving a girl very likely.


Ever since an early patch (1.3), the fruit will only work when raw. Eating cooked foods that contain apple or watermelon has no effect on the baby's gender.

 If you feel your business and another business have a similar approach to customers or have products that would complement each other well, consider forming an alliance. The alliance is different from a merger as you will not be taking over the other business or combining your assets. Instead, you may feature the other businessâ€™ products and vice versa so you can both appeal to a different market. For example, if you have a restaurant, you might advertise that you get your vegetables from a locally owned farm. You may also collaborate on a new product with the other business that you roll out together and promote, doubling your customer base.There are five main types of business alliances:A sales alliance: This is where you make an agreement with another business to sell products or services that complement each other.
A solution specific alliance: This is where you and another business make a formal agreement to develop and sell a particular product or service together.
A geographic specific alliance: This is where you and another business agree to market certain products and services in a specific geographical area.
An investment alliance: This is where you make an agreement with another business to combine funds to create a shared investment.
A joint venture: This is where you make an agreement with another business to share control, profit, and loss in a specific economic undertaking.

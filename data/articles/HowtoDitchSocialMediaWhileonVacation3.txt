 Studies show that social accountability has a major impact on you sticking with a commitment. Let everyone know that you are planning to stay off social media for the duration of your trip. If you happen to slip, they’ll help get you back on the right track.You might simply tell your companions “I won’t be logging onto social media while we’re away.” Or, you might tell the world by updating your status, “Sorry, guys, but I’m headed on vacation. Won’t be posting until I return.”

, Technology is quite helpful when it comes to staying accountable. Lucky for you, there are numerous applications you can download that help control your smartphone usage. You can block your access to the internet for a short time with apps like Freedom or Self-Control. Or, you can stop yourself from using social media apps specifically., Another conditioned response many people have is uploading photos immediately after taking them. If this describes you, it may help to depart from your smart phone camera for the trip. Slip your smart phone into your bag, and use a real camera. You may even get better photos., Checking your phone is almost like second nature. Keep yourself accountable and resist the urge to log back in by leaving it behind. If you’re with someone else who has a phone, you’ll still have contact to the outside world.

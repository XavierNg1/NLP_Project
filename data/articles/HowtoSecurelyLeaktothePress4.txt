 Make copies of any documents with care. Make sure that any printing, scanning, or downloading you have to do cannot be traced back to you.If you have an extensive number of documents, you might want to consider downloading them to a thumb drive and mailing that instead. You can buy a thumb drive at most any discount or electronics store.
Make sure there is nothing on the thumb drive that can be traced back either to you or to a personal or work computer.
 You need thick manilla envelopes and stamps for mailing. You also may want to invest in a postal scale, so you can accurately determine how much postage will be necessary.Don't go to your usual post office to buy your supplies, and don't order them online. Instead, go to a post office across town to get what you need. Pay for your mailing supplies with cash, and don't give any identifying information to the postal clerk.
Don't get rare or collectible stamps, just get basic, standard stamps. Another option may be to get a pre-paid, flat-rate mailing envelope.
 When you address the envelope, use nondescript, block letters if you're hand-lettering the envelope. Another option is to type up a label on the computer and use that., The envelope will be post-marked, and authorities can use that information to narrow down where you might live or work. For that reason, it's important to use a sidewalk mailbox in some other part of town where you don't normally go.As with any other trips you've made in connection with the leaking of documents or information to the press, do not use any credit or debit cards, or anything else (such as a public transportation pass) that can be traced back to you. Use only cash.
Try to find a mailbox that isn't near or within range of any surveillance cameras. For example, you don't want to use a mailbox that's sitting in front of an ATM, because the mailbox likely can be seen from the ATM's surveillance camera.

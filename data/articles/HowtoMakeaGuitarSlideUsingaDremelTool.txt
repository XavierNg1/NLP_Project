 There are a couple ways to do this: You could ask around, see if some friends/parents recycle glass bottles. Many people will gladly give you their old bottles. You could also try dumpster diving, but be aware that this may be illegal and possibly dangerous. Finally, if you absolutely cannot/do not want to try the other methods, you can always just go to the store and buy some glass bottles.;
, This will help guide your hand as you cut the neck off.
 This is not optional, as glass dust inhalation can cause silicosis, a fatal condition that results from particle inhalation, and glass shards could fly from the bottle, and damage your eyes. The only alternative is to have a rig set up to constantly drip water onto the cut, or for the bottle to be submerged while you cut, as this will keep the glass dust from flying.
 Make sure to insert it properly and tighten the collet properly.
 As long as you are around this speed, you'll be okay, but you will need a variable speed dremel for this.
 Remember, the key to using a dremel is not to put pressure on the material, but to use the speed to remove the glass. Just let your diamond wheel lightly touch the neck, and rotate the bottle. This will take many passes.
 Don't rush this, let it happen on it's own, in order to create a clean cut.
, Wash it until the glass dust is gone from the slide.

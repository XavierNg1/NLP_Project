 Homemade lens cleaner won't damage the coating on your lenses like some other cleaning agents might, but you can count on it to cut through the clouds and smudges on your glasses. This is also a cheap alternative to ready-made eyeglass cleaner in the event that you ran out or weren't given any at your previous visit to the eye doctor. To make your own lens cleaner, you will need:


Dish soap
Isopropyl alcohol (or witch hazel)
Measuring cup
Microfiber cloth
Small spray bottle
Water, You should clean your spray bottle and measuring cup before mixing your glass cleaning solution. This is because any dirt or dust left behind in these can contaminate your homemade lens cleaner. This is especially important if you are using a general purpose spray bottle that might have previously contained other household cleaners.
 Now that your measuring cup and spray bottle are clean, you should measure your water and isopropyl alcohol in a 1-to-1 ratio and add each to your spray bottle.Swirl your bottle gently to mix the solution.


For example, you may want to combine 1 ounce of water with 1 ounce of isopropyl alcohol in your spray bottle.
 Put one drop of dish soap into your mixed solution of water and isopropyl alcohol. Cap your bottle and swirl its contents gently to infuse the solution with soap.
 Spray a moderate amount of your lens cleaner onto each lens. Now you can take your clean microfiber cloth and wipe away all the gunk that has accumulated on your glasses.If you don't have a microfiber cloth intended for glasses, clean cotton should do the job.

  For figure references use snapshots you've taken, magazines or even the daily newspaper.;
,  Use your pencil, but hold it loosely near the top, rather than close to the lead, as you would to write.  Start with a lightly curved line for the spine.  Cross it almost at the top for shoulders, a few inches lower for the waistline and lower again for the hip line or pelvis.  This establishes the body's central mass.
  Remember to bend the arms at the elbow and wrist. ,  Allow for the neck. Drop lines off the two sides of the hip line for legs.  Do them in three parts, just as you did the arms.  Bending legs at the hips, knees and ankles gives movement to the figure.,,  Paint directly over the pencil lines. ,  Keep it wider at the shoulders and tapered slightly at the hips. 

,, Add small triangles for feet and hands.  You will now have the shape of a person.  Let this dry thoroughly.
  Paint right over the flesh-colored body, keeping your watercolor dense enough to let the colors shine, but still transparent. 

,  When the under layer is dry add more details up to three new layers.  Don't forget hair and facial features.
  Bear in mind that people come in all shapes and sizes.  Use your photo references as a guide only, don't try for a realistic image. Also, try doing the stick figure in diluted paint with a small brush.

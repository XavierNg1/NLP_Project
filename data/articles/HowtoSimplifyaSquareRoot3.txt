 For example, in the problem, √25, "√" is the radical symbol.
 You will need to find the square root of this number. For example, in the problem √25, "25" is the radicand.
 This is the number that the square root is being multiplied by; this sits to the left of the √ symbol. For example, in the problem, 7√2, "7" is the coefficient.
 For example, 2 is a factor of 8 because 8 ÷ 4 = 2, but 3 is not a factor of 8 because 8÷3 doesn’t result in a whole number. As another example, 5 is a factor of 25 because 5 x 5 = 25.
 Simplifying a square root just means factoring out any perfect squares from the radicand, moving them to the left of the radical symbol, and leaving the other factor inside the radical symbol. If the number is a perfect square, then the radical sign will disappear once you write down its root. For example, √98 can be simplified to 7√2.

 In a large bowl, dump the cornstarch and squirt the cornstarch.;
, Combine ingredients with a wooden spoon and then begin to knead with your hands until well-combined.
 This dough may tend to be more wet or crumbly depending upon your measurements but also the environment (humid environments may require more corn starch). Add ingredients in small increments--you may only need a drop or two of hair conditioner or a few sprinkles of corn starch to create the perfect consistency.


Add corn starch if dough seems to be too wet--you want the dough to be silky smooth but you also donâ€™t want it to stick to your hands.






Drizzle more hair conditioner if the dough appears to break apart.

 Music can prompt a powerful emotional response in you. And, while you may be searching for inspiration to get work done, typically your work passions are connected to your emotions. Find songs that encourage you and create a playlist.For instance, if you are feeling down, listening to an animated song can lift you back up. Or, you don’t have to listen to words at all. Try playing classical music as you work for inspiration.
 If you’re searching for inspiration, nature is perhaps the greatest source. The great outdoors has inspired many to create or do. It will likely offer you the same spark of enthusiasm. Plus, just getting outside for a few minutes is a terrific way to reduce stress.

Go for a walk in nature. Or, sit in the sunshine or near a body of water and marvel at what you see., Admire the works of artists to find inspiration. Paintings, sculptures, and other art forms can spark your own creativity. What’s more, by noting the multitude of different styles, mediums, and subjects of different artists, you’ll remember that everyone, including you, has something unique to offer the world., Experiencing a positive emotion can trigger new ideas and possibilities. Plus, if you tend to lean in the direction of “all work and no play” it can be helpful to treat yourself every once in awhile. Think of a way to indulge your senses. This could be through gourmet foods or a luxurious massage.

When you partake in this indulgence, be all there. Fully engage your senses and let yourself soak up the experience. You just might leave feeling much more relaxed, and inspired.

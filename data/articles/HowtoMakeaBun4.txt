 Brush your hair to remove all knots and tangles. You can choose to have a part or to have all your hair pulled straight back, so brush it accordingly. If your hair is very frizzy consider lightly misting it to dampen it.
 A braided bun can be placed at any location on your head. It can be created using a brush for a very professional and sophisticated look, or finger-pulled back for a more relaxed appearance. Use a ponytail to secure the location on your head.
 Start at the base, and form a normal braid by splitting your hair into three sections and crossing them over each other. You should start by moving the section on the right over the center piece, and then taking the section on the left and moving it over the center piece. Continue this pattern until you reach the end of your ponytail.









When you get to the end, simply hold onto it. You will pin it to your head, so there is no need to use an elastic.
If you feel that you absolutely must use an elastic with this style, try to use a small clear one to minimize its appearance. Otherwise, you will be able to see it inside your bun.
 When you get to the ends, tuck them beneath the base of the bun. Secure your hair with a few bobby pins, making sure that your hair will not fall out.
 If you want, you can pull a few strands of hair outside of your bun to create a messy look. Coat your hair with hairspray, and add any cute accessories you might like. A headband goes especially well with a braided bun for a more bohemian feel.

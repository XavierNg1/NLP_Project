Sun-lightening can help with stained or otherwise discolored hemp. If you've got a stained hemp item, wash it thoroughly, then air dry it in the sun for a long period of time to help naturally "bleach" the stain.

In general, most hemp items will dry extremely quickly compared to other fabrics. You can usually get away with not needing to worry much about drying them, especially on high heat.
 Dry cleaning hemp draperies, upholstery, slip covers and other home furnishings will shrink and ruin the items. It's usually recommended that you dry clean fabric that is used for home furnishings and high end garments, reducing the risk of shrinkage, but the opposite will be true with hemp. Wash upholstery as you would clothing and other items described above.

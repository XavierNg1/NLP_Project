 If you want to change the background for all of the slides in the presentation, you’ll be able to do that shortly.;
,, To make the background a single color, choose Solid fill. Click the “Color” button to select a color from the palette.
 Select Gradient fill to effectively make one (or more) color(s) fade into another. Select one of the preset gradients from the menu or design your own. Use the Direction menu to view different gradient pattern options, and the “Gradient stops” slider to adjust where each color begins and ends.
 Select Picture or texture fill to use any personal photo as your slide background.


Click “File” to select the location of your custom image. Or, if you prefer, choose one of the preset textures from the list.
You can move the Transparency slider to adjust how opaque the image or texture will appear. If you choose a “busy” image or pattern, you may want to raise the transparency so the text on your slide remains easy to read.
 If you have PowerPoint 2013 or later, you can select the Pattern fill option to choose from a list of simple preset patterns. Modify the colors in these patterns with the “Foreground” and “Background” menus beneath the pattern palette.
 If you decide you don’t like any of the background options, click the “Reset Background” button to return to the previous background. Otherwise:


If you only want the new background to appear on the current slide, click “Close” to save the changes.
If you would like every slide in your presentation to have the new background, click “Apply to All.”

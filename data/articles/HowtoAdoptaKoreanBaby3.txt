 Unless the child is a previously adopted child who has legally resided with you for two years or more, your new baby must be an orphan in order to apply for an immigrant visa.


Typically, an orphan is a child who has lost both parents. Both parents may have died, or they may have abandoned the child. Children in single-parent households are rarely labeled as orphans, but an exception may be made if the parent cannot care for the child and turns custody of him or her over without demanding any rights later on., Form I-604 must be completed after you have a specific child in mind, and the investigation officially determines whether or not the prospective adoptive child presently has legal orphan status.
 Once the baby arrives home, the U.S. adoption agency will perform several home visits spaced six months apart. The U.S. agency then sends a report back to the South Korean agency, which holds the reports permanently. A Korean baby is not officially adopted until after he or she resides with the adoptive parents for one year, and these follow-up visits usually last until the child becomes a naturalized citizen.

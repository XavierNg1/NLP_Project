 Open Notepad and type the following commands in the file.


xcopy /s /i "THE FOLDER ADDRESS YOU WANT TO COPY" "DESTINATION LOCATION";
,, You have to make some minor changes in the batch file you just created. In the code, type the actual values instead of the capital text.


For example, if you want to copy a folder named folder1 from D: to E:, then enter D:\folder1 instead of THE FOLDER ADDRESS YOU WANT TO COPY and E:\folder1 instead of DESTINATION LOCATION.
 Save the newly edited batch file and place it anywhere you want.
 Your specified file will be copied from its current location to the one you have specified in the destination address.

 In order for a blow dryer to work, you need to dampen the clothing first. Don't douse it. Just make it a little wet, perhaps with a spray bottle. Then, turn the dryer on the lowest setting. A plastic focusing tip really helps.









Hold the dryer about two inches away from the clothing so you don’t make it too hot. You don't want to burn the clothing or otherwise damage it.
You could also hang the wrinkled clothing first, and then direct the blow dryer’s heat on it, again standing one or two inches away.
 Maybe you're in a situation where you don't have any way to apply heat or steam to your clothes. You're in luck. You could try rolling or flattening it.


Take the wrinkled clothing and roll it up very tightly. Make it look like a burrito. Then, place it under a mattress or something else heavy for about an hour. When you remove the clothing and unroll it, there should be fewer wrinkles.
Alternatively, you could flatten the clothing with a damp towel. Place the wrinkled clothing on a flat surface. Dampen a towel (or a paper towel if you don’t have a bath towel). Put the towel on top of the clothing (where the wrinkled area is). Press down. Then let it dry. These methods will take a little longer than usual, but with some smoothing from your hands through the towel, your clothes should be relatively wrinkle free.
 Steam removes wrinkles, so you could boil water in a tea kettle. You want to hold the clothing about 12 inches away from the tea kettle’s steaming spout, though, or you could damage the clothing. One benefit of this approach is you can drink a cup of tea afterwards! This approach works well for small problem areas on the clothing.
If you have a larger wrinkled garment, it’s best to use the steam from a hot shower instead.

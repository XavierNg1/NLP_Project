 If you're on the defensive, counter-attack your opponent after they make an attack. This should help to put you on the offensive. Then, use repeated power attacks to keep your opponent on the defensive and batter them down., Djem-So is all about dominating the duel using (Force-enhanched) strength. For this reason, some of the more pacifist Jedi frown upon it., This attack is special to Djem So. The handle is held behind the head withe blade pointing downwards or backwards. The lightsaber is then swung up and over the head, and down onto the opponent, with as much force as you can muster. This attack is very useful for breaking an opponents defense.,

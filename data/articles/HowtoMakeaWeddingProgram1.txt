 A wedding program is basically a list of the events at your wedding ceremony. You will want to ensure that the events are listed in sequential order on the program. Here is a list of items to consider for your wedding program:Name of bride and groom.
Date and location of the ceremony.
Processional and recessional music selections.
Greetings from the officiant.
Special readings (cite the readings and also include the name of the reader).
Prayers or religious customs.
Exchanging of vows and rings (some people like to print their vows in the program. This will take up extra space and may cause the program to be too long.)
Lighting of unity candle or special song.
Pronouncement of marriage.;
, Typically, the person officiating your wedding will have a general outline for how they perform a wedding ceremony. Make sure that you talk about any additional readings or songs you would like to include and arrange where they should be placed in the ceremony.
 A wedding program is a great place to provide the names of the bride's and groomâ€™s parents along with the wedding party. Remember that many people attending your wedding will not know each other. A list of names can allow you to introduce your parents and bridal party to your guests.For example, list the parents of the bride, parents of the groom, maid of honor, best man, bridesmaids, and groomsmen.
You may also want to include the names of grandparents.
 If your wedding reception is in a different location from your wedding ceremony, it is a good idea to include the address for the reception on the back of the program. This will help your guests with traveling from the ceremony to the reception.


You may also want to include a map and directions to help your guests as they travel.

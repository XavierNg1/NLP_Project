 This aftershave feels like the cool breeze of autumn on your face — for half the day. The twin powers of menthol and eucalyptus soothe and purify your skin. Comparable to the popular green brand of Proraso aftershaves.


1/2 Cup of Rubbing Alcohol or Vodka
1/4 Cup of Witch Hazel
1 Tablespoon Glycerin
1 Pinch Alum
2-5 Drops Peppermint Oil
2-5 Drops Eucalyptus Oil

, Comparable to the classic line of aftershaves, this sweet yet woody scent is perfect for winter. Mix all the ingredients in a mason jar, seal, and place in a dark, cool place for 10 to 14 days. Strain the residue through a coffee filter or fine mesh sieve.


1/2 Cup of Black Rum
1/4 Cup of Witch Hazel
1 Tablespoon glycerin
2 Dried Bay Leaves (not the kind they sell at the grocery store; rather, the kind that's available at natural food stores — pimenta racemosa.)
1 Teaspoon Cloves, crushed
1/2 Teaspoon Allspice, ground
1 Stick Cinnamon, broken in pieces
2-5 Drops Orange Oil

, If you love hints of fennel and licorice, you'll love this aftershave.


1/8 Cup Absinthe
1/3 Cup Vodka
1/4 Cup Witch Hazel
1 Tablespoon Glycerin
1 Pinch Alum

, (Don't worry, the ACV doesn't smell once it dries.) For more sensitive skin.


5 Tablespoons Apple Cider Vinegar
5 Tablespoons Orange Flower Water
3 Tablespoons Witch Hazel
5 Drops Bergamot Oil
5 Drops Lemon Oil
3 drops Neroli Oil

, As if one powerful coolant weren't enough, this aftershave recipe capitalizes on two: cucumber and mint. Simple but incredibly refreshing.

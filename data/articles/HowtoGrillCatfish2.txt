 Whether you caught them yourself or you're buying them from a fish market, make sure the fish you want to grill have clear eyes and undamaged skin. Grilled whole fish should be fresh, not frozen, for best results.


If you're buying the catfish from a fish market, have the fishmonger clean and skin the fish for you.
If you caught your own fish, you'll need to clean and skin it on your own.
 For whole grilled catfish, seasoning plays more than one role. Seasoning the inside and the outside of the catfish is meant to both flavor the meat and keep it moist while it grills. Mix up the following ingredients (double if you're grilling two catfish):


1 tablespoon melted butter
1 tablespoon lemon juice
Salt and pepper

, Coat the inside cavity of the fish with the mixture, and rub it into the outside as well. Make sure every part of the fish is coated so it won't dry out as it cooks.
 Heat your outdoor grill to medium high (about 375°F to 425°F). Use a paper towel soaked in cooking oil to coat the metal grill rack with oil, so the delicate flesh of the fish won't stick. Let the grill heat completely before you start cooking the fish.


When you're cooking a whole fish, it's important to cook it low and slow. Otherwise, you'll end up with a fish that's burned on the outside and raw on the inside. Make sure the grill never gets too hot while you cook.
 Instead of placing it directly over the hottest coals, place it on a part of the grill that doesn't get direct heat. This will prevent the fish from burning.
 The larger the fish, the longer it will need to cook. It's ready to flip when the underside of the flesh is firm with a set of dark grill marks.
 The fish is ready to eat when the flesh easily flakes apart when poked with a fork. It should be completely opaque and hot through to the middle.

 After you start supporting effective charities, you should start encouraging others to do so as well. Spreading the word about charities that are having a large impact on people’s lives will lead to more donations for those charities and more lives saved as a result.


Use social media to tell your friends about effective charities. Post articles, share information about effective charities, and encourage others to donate through your social media posts.
Talk to your friends about effective charities and share data with them about how these effective charities are helping people.
 Singer explains that some effective altruists have adopted a vegan diet as part of their efforts to reduce the harm caused by factory farming.Vegans avoid foods that contain animal products such as meat, milk, and eggs. Adopting a vegan diet has the added benefit of reducing your personal contribution to global warming, because raising animals contributes more to climate change than the entire transport sector.#Donate a part of yourself. Consider donating blood, bone marrow, or even a kidney to prolong the lives of others. Some effective altruists see donating blood, tissue, and organs as an important aspect of doing the most good that they can.Donating blood is the easiest way to help others and it is minimally invasive. Watch for blood drives in your area to contribute.
Donating bone marrow is slightly more invasive. It used to require anesthesia and donors experienced some bruising and pain in the days that followed the procedure. But now most donors give stem cells, and this is more like donating blood, and is painless.
Donating a kidney is a much bigger decision, but we can live with only one kidney and, on average, a kidney donation will add 10 years to someone’s life.

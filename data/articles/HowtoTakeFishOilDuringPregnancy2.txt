 Despite the controversy around fish oil supplements, it’s undisputed that fish oil is rich in EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), and also that these fatty acids are essential to your body’s function. DHA supports the nervous system and thus is particularly crucial for the developing brains and eyes of babies in the womb.Though the role of EPA and DHA in cognitive development is undisputed, studies are inconclusive as to the ability of fish oil supplements to deliver these omega-3’s effectively to the pregnant woman and her fetus.
Research suggests that you need 200 mg of DHA every day to support the growth of your baby’s cognitive and visual systems., Some studies suggest that fish oil supplements can improve your baby’s development significantly. For example, one recent study shows that toddlers born to mothers who ingested fish oil supplements displayed better hand-eye coordination than other toddlers whose mothers did not do so.Another study in Denmark found that the babies of women taking fish oil in the last trimester of pregnancy had a lower incidence of asthma., Despite some studies supporting the advisability of ingesting fish oil capsules, the evidence is far from conclusive. For example, a study in Australia concluded that the children of women who took fish oil during the last trimester of pregnancy performed no better on cognitive and language tasks than the children of women who did not.Even the above-mentioned Danish study warns against overly optimistic conclusions from their study. Despite their results, the researchers acknowledge that the fish oil consumption of the women in their study was well above the recommended dose, so they still cannot recommend that pregnant women follow suit.

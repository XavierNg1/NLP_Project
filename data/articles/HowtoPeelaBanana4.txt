 Take the stem in your dominant (throwing) hand and make sure that the banana is curving toward, and not away from you. Stand over a cutting board, a table, or something else that can stop the banana from flying out too far away from you.
 Hold on to the stem and thrust your hand and the banana outward in a natural motion that curves downward. Just snap your wrist and use enough force to fling the banana forward. If done successfully, you should be left holding onto the stem and a sliver of peeled banana skin. If it doesn't work the first time, then try, try again -- this method does take some practice.
 Now that you've already peeled off a sliver of banana, you can peel the banana the traditional way, from the bottom up, before you enjoy your treat. This method definitely gets creativity and flashiness points.

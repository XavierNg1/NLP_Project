 It will likely look like a small hole. When you find it, use a straightened paperclip or toothpick to insert into the reset hole and press. This will reset all your radio settings and your clock to 12:00, but it should cause the unit to eject your CD(s) when you press the eject button.;
, If you can get one like the doctor uses with a long wooden handle that would be good, otherwise get a small package of REAL Q-tip branded swabs. What you're looking for in a swab is a handle that won't bend too much.
 This will cause the eject-sensor pins to line up and thus release the CD for the unit to eject. You may need to remove the unit's face (hopefully yours has a detachable face) and grasp the CD and manually finish pulling it out of the load-slot. Re-attach the face and spray some canned compressed air (like for computers) into the unit followed by a good CD laser lens cleaning disc. What most likely has happened is there is dirt dust and grit accumulated in the tracks where those pins travel. If you fail to get the unit to load the CD laser lens cleaning disc you may either need to get the Q-tip and swab from the right side back to center then the left side back to center which will re-set the unit to accept the new disc, or try putting the disc in the loading slot partway until you feel the unit "grab" and pull the CD. Let it take it in some but keep your grip in the disc, and gently pull like you're trying to pull it back out. After 2 to 4 seconds, turn the disc loose and see if the player loads it. If all goes well, a little squirt of WD-40 will help keep the pins traveling in their tracks freely, but you'll have to use the cleaning disc again after you do that.

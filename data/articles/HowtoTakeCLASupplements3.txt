 The manufacturer should provide directions for use and information about how to store and consume your supplement. Your supplement will probably be a small tablet or capsule that you need to take with water. The instructions label might also feature a chart that provides information about how often to take the supplement.Your doctorâ€™s instructions and knowledge of your own health should supersede any recommended intake advice provided by the CLA manufacturer.
 There are a number of side effects associated with CLA supplements. These mostly include flu-like symptoms such as watery stools, vomiting, nausea, and general lethargy and fatigue. You might also experience headaches, dizziness, constipation, and/or hives (a kind of rash in the form of small, red bumps on the skin).Clinical symptoms include higher levels of cholesterol, an enlarged liver and/or spleen, increased risk for diabetes, and reduced nutritional value in breast milk.Most people report that the side effects subside after about two weeks of regular use., Some people believe that supplements are an acceptable alternative to medication. However, medications receive far more testing and evaluation than do unregulated supplements like CLA. Medications are prescribed by a doctor, and carefully dosed in order to provide you with the right amount. CLA supplements cannot substitute for doctor-prescribed medications.
 CLA supplements come in different concentrations. Some supplements are 500 milligram (mg) tablets, others are 1,000 mg tablets. Research suggests that the average person needs no more than 3-4 grams of CLA per day. So if your supplement is 1,000 mg, you could take it three times per day and meet your daily CLA intake goal.

 Knowing when to contact a doctor or get help is essential. Stomach pain is a symptom of many different issues and some can be serious, such as peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, appendicitis, autoimmune disease, gall bladder issues, cancer, and more. Generally for stomach pain, get help immediately if:You have abdominal pain that is sudden and sharp, or you have pain in your chest, neck, or shoulder
You’re vomiting blood or have blood in your stool
Your abdomen is hard and tender to touch
You can't move your bowels and are also vomiting

, Though these conditions are typically minor and can easily be treated with over-the-counter medicines, you should see your doctor if:Your symptoms last longer than a few days or do not improve with medication
You lose weight you were not trying to lose
You have sudden or severe pain. Get immediate care if you feel a crushing or squeezing pain.
You have trouble swallowing
Your skin or eyes look pale or yellow
You vomit blood or have bloody, dark stool
Your stool looks like coffee grounds

, The other symptoms also associated with “stomach flu” can lead to a situation where you should see a doctor. These include:You have been vomiting for more than two days
Diarrhea persists more than several days or is bloody
You have a persistent high fever of 101°F (38.3°C) or higher
You have lightheadedness, fainting, or confusion when standing

, If or when you do decide to see a doctor, do not take aspirin, ibuprofen, or any other anti-inflammatory medications or narcotic pain medications unless your doctor has seen you and has prescribed these. They can worsen some stomach pains.If you know that the source of your cramps is menstrual, however, anti-inflammatories can be taken.Acetaminophen is acceptable if your doctor has verified that your pain is not related to your liver.

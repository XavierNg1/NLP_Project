 The choice of a godparent is not yours alone. To begin the decision process, sit down with your significant other and talk through what you both want in a godparent and any people they may have in mind.
 Discuss the selection of a godparent with your minister or clergy leader. The clergy leader will be able to help you determine what characteristics are most important in the godparent you choose.
 This is a good way to get firsthand advice on how to choose a godparent. Ask the person to explain their thought process when choosing a godparent for their child. Also compare what youâ€™re looking for in a godparent to what they were looking for.

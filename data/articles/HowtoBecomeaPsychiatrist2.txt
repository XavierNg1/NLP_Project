 Do research on the different sub-specialties and figure out what you want to pursue during your residency. Consider the following options:


Addiction psychiatry, which involves treating patients who are dealing with addiction (such as substance abuse, gambling, food, and sex addictions).
Child and adolescent psychiatry.
Geriatric psychiatry.
Emergency psychiatry, which involves dealing with emergency situations that may endanger a person's life (for example, suicide attempts, violent changes in behavior, self-harm, psychosis).
Forensic psychiatry, which is psychiatry within the field of criminology, often dealing with the use of the insanity defense in a trial.
Neuropsychiatry, which is psychiatry connected to diseases of the nervous system.
 After you have your DO or MD, you'll spend the next four years getting hands-on experience with patients under the supervision of licensed doctors. The first year of residency will include several months in internal medicine and neurology. You'll put into practice all that you learned in the classroom while you pursued your medical degree. Your residency will be set up through your school and completed at a hospital or clinic.Your residency will include general medicine rotations, neurology, psychiatry and electives geared toward the specialized fields of psychiatry that interests you. You'll work in both outpatient and inpatient psychology.
Many students of psychiatry complete their residency working in the psychiatric ward of a hospital. You will work with patients to treat problems like clinical depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychosis, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, dementia, post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociative identity disorder, and sleep disorders.

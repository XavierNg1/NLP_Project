 What do you expect of this business and how will you run it? This document is important for sorting out exactly what you hope to achieve from your cupcake truck. Things to note in your business plan include:


Table of contents
Executive summary
Values and mission statement
Management team and expected staff
The goals for your business
What products you'll sell
Marketing strategy (which includes observing the competition)
Action plan or a timeline
Financial strategy (including the risks you're likely to encounter, along with risk-abatement measures);
, Choose something catchy and interesting that will give people a reason to take a second look. When considering the name, already be thinking about the logo and colors.


If using your own name, be very certain that this will be a great match for your cupcake business. For example: "Gill's Cupcakes" might be great except for the fact that Gill down the road has already named his business "Gill's Pies".
 This is a cupcake truck, and so it's simple. Perhaps you'd like to expand later, and that's fine. Just don't get hung up on this aspect for now.

 Place your teeth together naturally making sure your jaw remains relaxed without forcing your teeth together. This helps your teeth to position naturally and you can identify if your teeth overlap at the bottom.


Do not force your teeth together as this may produce exaggerated results.;
, In order to self-diagnose an overbite, you need a mirror to help you visualize your teeth. While standing in front of a mirror, smile and reveal your teeth.


Position yourself as close to the mirror as possible and smile so that you spread your lips away from the teeth.
Check to see if your upper teeth fall over the top of your bottom front teeth.
If your teeth noticeably overlap the bottom (more than 3.5 mm), your bite alignment is off and you have an overbite.You may also feel your lower row of teeth biting close to or into the roof of your mouth.
 When your teeth are not properly aligned you suffer from a condition called malocclusion. There are two categories of malocclusion classified as overbite and one classified as underbite.Class 1 is the most common class. If you have a class 1 overbite, your bite is normal; however, the upper teeth overlap the bottom teeth.
Class 2 is when the upper jaw and the teeth significantly overlap the bottom jaw and teeth. When viewed from the side, the chin is behind the normal position.
Class 3 malocclusion (also called underbite or prognathism) is when the lower jaw protrudes so that the teeth overlap the upper jaw and teeth.
 If the home test indicated that you may have an overbite, it is best to have it checked by a dentist who can do it during a routine exam.


If left untreated, an overbite can have some health consequences such as headache, tooth decay, speech difficulties, mouth breathing, and difficulty chewing.It can also lead to TMJ disorders which can influence your posture.

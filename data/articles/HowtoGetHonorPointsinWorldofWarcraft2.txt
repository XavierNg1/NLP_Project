 A battleground is an area where two teams of players fight against each other to accomplish a specific objective. The objective of a battleground is not simply to kill players on the enemy team, however there are plenty of opportunities to do so.


To enter a battleground, you can press “I” on your keyboard or you can click on the Group Finder icon on your menu bar. The menu bar is located on the bottom of your screen, to the right of your action bar (the bar with your abilities and spells) and to the left of your bags.
On the menu bar, look for the icon of a green eye. Click on the green eye and it will bring up the Group Finder window. Once you have opened up the Group Finder window, look on the bottom and you should see 3 tabs—“Dungeons & Raids,” “Player vs Player,” and “Challenges.”
Click on “Player vs Player” and you will see a list of options in the window. You can either select “Random Battleground” or choose a specific battleground. Once you have made your choice, click on the button that says “Join Battle,” and you will be placed into the queue to enter a battleground.
Note: The minimum level required to enter a battleground is 10. You will not be able to queue for any battlegrounds until you are at least level 10.
 Once confronted by the enemy, just kill away. Battlegrounds are a quick and effective way to obtain Honor Points. Every player on the winning team of a battleground is given a certain amount of Honor Points (usually around a few hundred) for the win. Even if your team does not win, there will be plenty of enemy players you can kill to get honorable kills.

The hotter the water, the better it will dissolve the glue under the label., If you can't find any dish soap, you can also use ordinary hand soap. This will help loosen the label and make it easier to remove.
 White vinegar is somewhat acidic, which will help dissolve the glue holding the label to the jar. It will make removing the label and residue easier., Take the lids off the jars, and lay them down on their sides so that they fill with water and sink to the bottom.
 The longer you wait, the more time the vinegar will have to dissolve the glue under the label. About 30 minutes should be plenty for stubborn labels, but you can check your jars after 10 minutes.
 It should slide off easily. If you get any residue, try to scrape it off using a scrubby sponge.
 Once the label is off, rinse the jar off, and dry it using a clean towel. Your jar is now ready to use!

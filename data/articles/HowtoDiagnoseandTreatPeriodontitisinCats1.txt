 Sometimes, the only noticeable symptom of periodontitis is bad breath. If you notice that your cat has persistent bad breath, you should take them to the vet to be checked out.A healthy cat should not have a strong or offensive smell on their breath.
It is normal for the cat's breath to smell like their food after they eat, but it is not normal for the cat to have persistent bad breath. If you believe that your cat has periodontitis, do a smell check a few times a day for a few days to see if the bad breath is consistent.;
, There may be a few visible signs of periodontitis that you can notice by gently checking your catâ€™s mouth, teeth, and gums. Sit with your cat on your lap. As you pet and talk to your cat, gently tip their head back. Use a finger to part their lips to see their teeth and gums. Note that your cat may not let you inspect their mouth. If they resist your attempt, stop immediately. Take your cat to the vet instead for a full oral exam. Signs of periodontitis include:


Red gums
Gum recession
Loose teeth
Swelling around the mouth or face
Drooling
Yellowed teeth, If your cat is experiencing tooth pain, they may be acting strangely. You might notice them pawing at their face frequently. They may also have difficulty eating.

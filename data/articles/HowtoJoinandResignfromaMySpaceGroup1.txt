 You can find a link at the top of the page.;
, The index is categories of all the groups, such as "Food, Drink, and Wine" or "Schools & Alumni". If you click on a link, it's defaulted to the most popular groups (groups with the most members) at the top. You can change that option to "Newest" (the newest created groups) or "Group Name" (groups within the category are alphabetized).
 Public groups are groups that anyone can join & on the other hand, private groups need the consent and acceptance by the group moderator (or the administrator of the group). However, some private groups will have a restriction, as you must be invited by the group moderator or a member of the group to join or view their pages.
 Next to the group moderator's picture on the right hand side, you will see buttons. Click on Join Group. If it's a private, but viewable group, you must wait for the moderator's approval or denial.

 Silken tofu does not need pressing, as it is softer and used more often in blended dishes. Firm and extra firm tofu almost always needs to be pressed, as it's density allows it to keep more water when cooking. Whether or not to press tofu depends, more often than not, on how you plan to cook it:


Blending, mixing, or raw: Don't press.

Frying, grilling, baking: Press as much water out as possible.;
, Water and oil do not mix well, so any cooked or fried tofu needs to be drained. This water is to help the tofu stay fresh in stores -- dump it all out now and rinse off your block. Pat dry when done.
 Make sure you drain off all the excess water, then wrap the tofu in towels. Give it a good, firm press with your hands, draining off any water that comes out., After the initial pressing, you'll need to weight the tofu down and let it sit for 30 minutes or more to remove the rest of the water. Wrap the tofu in something to absorb the water, the place on a cutting board, plate, or shallow bowl., Place a flat board on top of the tofu, then add weight (cookbooks, pots of water) to the top of the cutting board. Make sure you evenly distribute the weight.
 Once you've got the water out, you don't need to press anymore. Use a fresh towel to pat the tofu dry and start cooking., Make sure that your cuts aren't too small -- generally keeping chunks at least 1" big in every direction. Cut the tofu so that it is still sliced but holds it's original block shape, then proceed.

 Look for a nail polish remover that contains acetone. Put some on a cotton ball and rub it onto the ink to be removed. If on the face, be very careful to avoid getting it too close to your eyes or mouth.

, This works very similarly to the nail polish remover. Put some on a cotton ball and rub it onto the ink to be removed. If on the face, be very careful to avoid getting it too close to your eyes or mouth.
 Use pads which include alcohol. Wipe at the affected areas. These will work better if the ink is on your face.
 Use either olive oil or baby oil. Either should help to remove some (but probably not all) of the ink.
 You can also use sugar, in combination with any of the above methods, to scrub the area with the ink. This should help remove the dead skin cells which contain some of the ink.

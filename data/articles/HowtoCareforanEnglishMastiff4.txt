 English Mastiffs have a short, low-maintenance coat that should not require much grooming. However, they do shed quite a bit, especially in the fall and spring. Use a rubber curry brush to comb them daily at the most or weekly at the least to control their shedding and remove any dirt or mats in their fur., Mastiffs have deeply wrinkled faces, and bacteria can sometimes hide in the crevices. Wipe their wrinkles at least once a week with a baby wipe and then towel them dry to prevent any potential infections., English Mastiffs are a naturally clean breed who should not require much extra attention. Frequent washing dries out a Mastiff’s skin and compromises the natural oils in their coats, so they should only be bathed when necessary. Use a mild, hypoallergenic dog shampoo to lather up your pooch from the neck down, and rinse with warm water.
Because of the logistical difficulties involved with bathing such a large beast, you may want to consider taking them to a professional groomer to do the job for you. Keep in mind that the rates will usually be higher for Mastiffs because of their size.
 Use a large clipper especially designed for dogs to trim your Mastiff’s toenails on a regular basis. Go paw by paw, starting with the ones in front. Be sure that your dog stands still while you do it.Always look at the underside of your dog’s toenail before you clip it to see where their nerve ends. You should only trim off the part that extends beyond the nerve, and always err on the side of leaving too much rather than painfully cutting your pooch’s nerve endings.
 Brush daily if possible, or 2-3 times a week at minimum. This will prevent bad breath, tartar buildup, and bacterial infections. Be sure to use a brush and toothpaste that are made especially for large dogs.

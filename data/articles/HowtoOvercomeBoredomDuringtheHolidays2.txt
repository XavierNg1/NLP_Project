 Whether you're crafty, handy with wood, crazy about it or itching to cook something, you can choose a distinct project to start and perhaps even finish within the holiday time. Make a slideshow, bake a cake, make a paper mâché, write a play. Your project might even involve redesigning your room or house, planning a trip overseas or creating a budget to follow.


Now is a good time to focus on a few things you've been putting off, like cleaning out the eaves, putting your tax receipts in order or de-fleaing the cat. Doing something constructive is always more effective than sitting about focusing on how bored you're feeling.

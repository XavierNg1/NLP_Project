 Since she's a shy girl, it is important during this stage that you don't force her to talk with you. She might need time to adjust to being around you or to speaking with you, and rushing her into conversation could cause her stress.When checking to see if she likes you, first talk about low-stakes topics, like the weather, teachers, classmates, or daily life. Be patient and it is likely she will become more comfortable with you.


It might take time before she's ready to break out of her shell, so be persistent if she is even slightly responsive.
 Studies have found that people naturally speak more around those that they like and have romantic interest in.When you share conversations with her that go on and on, or if you find her more conversant around you, take this as a sign of interest. Also, speaking with her more should put her more at ease around you, which will make asking her out less difficult. Some topics you can use to get her started include:


Future plans
Hobbies and sports
Family
Favorite class
Dream job

, After weeks of wondering, "Does she like me?" you might be ready to ask, but with a shy girl, this might not be the best decision. Try to approach whatever question is on your mind in a way that gives an escape if the question is too uncomfortable.Whatever you do, do not comment on how shy she is, as this could make her even more self-conscious and less willing to talk.Instead of asking, "Want to go to a movie with me?" you might instead mention, "That movie looks really great. I was hoping to see it next week when it comes out, but I don't have anyone to go with."

, If you see a lot of the signs and signals of romance in your relationship with her, and you believe that she likes you, trust your instincts. And remember, though rejection is rarely enjoyable, if you never try, you'll never have a chance of finding that special someone.

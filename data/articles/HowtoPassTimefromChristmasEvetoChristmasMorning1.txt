 Don't think about tomorrow, as you will become more excited and anxious for the joys that await, and you won't be able to concentrate on doing anything, and when you're waiting for something to happen it'll feel like a lot longer than it actually is.;
,


To do this you should treat the day like it's just an average day. Activities such as meeting up with friends and doing something (NOT shopping as you may accidentally purchase something someone has already got for you.) or walking/running, swimming or even staying at home and doing homework, cleaning your room will keep your mind off the christmas and on the task at hand so you don't feel super christmassy.
 If you find yourself without any work (any type of work or activity is homework, cleaning, wrapping etc.). Your mind will find it's way back to christmas! So this is probably the first time you'll ever read this, but skip a nights homework! It'll give you something to do.

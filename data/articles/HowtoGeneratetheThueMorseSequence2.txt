, Use the following equations alternatively to calculate the values:



t2n+1 = 1 - t2n (Eq. 1)

t2n = tn (Eq. 2)
For example:


n = 0, substituting in Eq. 1: t1 = 1 - t0 = 1 (t0 is 0)

n = 1, substituting in Eq. 2: t2 = t1 = 1


n = 1, substituting in Eq. 1: t3 = 1 - t2 = 1 - 1 = 0


n = 2, substituting in Eq. 2: t4 = t2 = 1


n = 2, substituting in Eq. 1: t5 = 1 - t4 = 1 - 1 = 0


n = 3, substituting in Eq. 2: t6 = t3 = 0


n = 3, substituting in Eq. 1: t7 = 1 - t6 = 1 - 0 = 1

 Place 1 cup (80 grams) of instant, nonfat dry milk into a blender. Add 1 cup (80 grams) of old fashioned or instant dry oats and 1 cup (142 grams) of almonds. Blend everything together into a fine powder.


Do not add water to the milk.
Powdered milk contains whey.
 Place the remaining 2 cups (160 grams) of instant, nonfat dry milk into the blender. Pulse the blender once more until everything is smooth.
 Use a container with a tight-fitting lid, such as a jar. Keep it at cool room temperature, and use it within 2 weeks. If you won't be able to use it within that time, keep it in the refrigerator instead; this will prevent the almonds from going rancid.
 Measure ½ cup (46 grams) of your protein powder into a blender. Add 1½ cups (350 milliliters) of milk (or any other liquid). Let the mixture sit for 5 to 10 minutes, then add any desired extracts, fruits, or yogurt. Blend until smooth, then drink it.


You have to let this protein powder sit for 5 to 10 minutes to allow the oats to turn to pulp.

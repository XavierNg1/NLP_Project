 Having a strong core is an important part of being a strong runner. Planks are great, versatile exercises for working your core muscles.To do a basic plank, get down on the floor as if you are going to do a push up. You can hold your body weight up on your elbows or on the palms of your hands. Keep your legs straight and your butt down. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart with your toes supporting the weight of your lower body.
Hold this position for 30 to 60 seconds. Then, come down and rest for a minute before repeating the exercise up to two more times.
 A side plank will work your oblique muscles as well as your legs and arm muscles. It is similar to a basic plank, but you will need a little more balance to achieve it.To do a side plank, get into a basic plank position and then lift one arm up and reach up to the ceiling. Turn your shoulders and hips together, keeping them squared like the corners of a cereal box. Your hips and shoulders should be in a vertically stacked position. Keep your abs and thighs firmly contracted as well to avoid uncontrolled twisting of the spine.
Balance in the position for 30 to 60 seconds. Then, slowly come back down into the basic plank position and then come down to rest. Rest for a minute and then repeat the exercise two more times.
 A bridge is a core exercise that also works your hamstrings, glutes, and abs. To perform a bridge pose, you will need to lie down on the floor on your back and then bring your knees up. Place your feet flat on the ground and place your palms on the ground next to your body.When you feel ready, raise up your butt so that only your shoulders, arms, hands, and feet are on the ground. Use your arms and hands to stabilize yourself.
Hold this position for about 30 to 60 seconds. Then, come back down to the ground and rest for a minute before attempting the pose again. Repeat the exercise two more times.

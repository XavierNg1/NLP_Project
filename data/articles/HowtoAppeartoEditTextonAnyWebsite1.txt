 The simplest way to do this is just by Googling, “edit current website bookmarklet.” This will bring up a number of pages with the appropriate link., You can edit the website you on which you found the link by simply clicking it, but you will more likely want to drag it into your bookmarks bar. This will enable you to use it on any website.
 Navigate to the website you want to appear to edit, and click on the bookmark. Clicking it won’t have any noticeable effect, but you will now be able to go into the text of the website and edit it as you see fit.

 The flowchart map allows you to examine a process and see the multiple options for getting it done. The flowchart can be linear and can just flow from one concept to the next, but it can also have multiple elements for examining a variety of outcomes. The starting point can be a process or a problem that needs a solution. Let's use the starting point, "Lamp doesn't turn on.", For the problem, "Lamp doesn't turn on," the most typical solution is that the lamp is not plugged in. Just write, "Lamp plugged in?" and connect it with an arrow to "Lamp doesn't turn on."

, Write a line from "Lamp plugged in?" that says "no" and another that says "yes." If you follow the line that says "no," then the response would be "Plug in lamp." Connect this response to "no" with a line. You've completed one flow of the concept, starting with "Lamp doesn't turn on" to "Plug in lamp." If you follow this "flow," then it should solve the problem.


But if the lamp is plugged in, you'll follow "yes" to another option: "Bulb burned out?" This is the next logical solution.
 From the question, "Bulb burned out?" you'll need to branch out two terms: "yes" and "no." If the answer to "Bulb burned out" is "yes," then you'll need to connect this word to the solution, "Replace bulb." You've completed another flow of the concept, because this should fix the broken lamp. But if it turns out that the bulb is not burned out, you'll have to follow "no," to the last option: "Repair lamp."


You have now completed a flowchart for the problem of a broken lamp, which will lead you to one of three solutions: plugging it in, replacing the bulb, or repairing the lamp.

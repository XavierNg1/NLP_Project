 You can purchase pre-paid phone cards from local convenience stores, chain pharmacies, and national retailers, like Wal-Mart or Target. The cost of a card ranges from $2 to $30 dollars. While some cards are located on wall and spinning racks near the register, other cards are located behind the register.Before purchasing the card, ask the clerk which cards they recommend.

By setting up an account, you can choose a phone card from a variety of options and reload your card online., Each card has an 800 number or a local access number, as well as a PIN number. In order to make a call, first dial the access number and enter your PIN. Then, listen for the prompt and input the phone number you are calling.Make sure to manually dial the full number of the party you are calling, including the international dialing code, country code, and area code.Most cards are activated at the time of purchase at the register. While some cards have a scratch off coating that conceals the PIN number, other cards will have their PIN numbers located on the receipt.
 Before purchasing the card, make sure to check the cardâ€™s cost per minute, i.e., rate, surcharges, rounding rates, and expiration date. Rates vary depending on which country you call, as well as what kind of phone you use, for example, a cellphone versus a payphone. Furthermore, some cards have disconnect fees, maintenance fees, and surcharges of 35 cents or more. Call the toll-free number on the card to find out about rates and fees if they are not listed.Some cards employ rounding where they round up in increments, like increments of three. This means that a one minute call is charged for three minutes.Cards might also have an expiration date of 30 days meaning if you do not use the card, it will not work after that date. Other cards might charge a non-usage fee if you go a certain amount of days without using the card.

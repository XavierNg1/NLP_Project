 You can store it in either the bottle that it's pumped into or in another container designed for breast milk storage. Make sure to label the containers and use the oldest milk first., If you have extra breast milk, you can freeze it in plastic containers designed for breast milk storage. Fill the containers 3/4 full to allow room for the milk to expand. Label the containers and be sure to use the milk within three or four months.


Don't freeze milk in bags that are not designed for this specific purpose. Certain plastics can leach chemicals into the milk. Disposable bottle bags are too flimsy.
When you're ready to use the milk, thaw it in the refrigerator first. Don't thaw it at room temperature.
Don't add fresh milk to a container of frozen milk.
 Rather than storing a big jar of milk, store it in small serving-sized containers in portions of 2 - 4 ounces, depending on how much your baby usually takes.

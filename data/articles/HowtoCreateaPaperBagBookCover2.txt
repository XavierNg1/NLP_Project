 Make a crease along the bottom cover. You can use double-sided tape to secure the fold, if you wish. This will help secure the cover.
 Wrap the paper up across the top of the book. Make a crease along the top cover. Again, feel free to use tape to hold the fold in place. Then, remove the book from the paper.









Measure the folds. They should be at least 1.6 in (4 cm) in length., You should have a strip of paper big enough to cover the book from top to bottom.









Try not to create new folds on top of preexisting folds in the paper. This will cause your book cover to tear more easily., Wrap the paper across the front of the book from left to right and adjust the book position until the two ends of the paper are even.
 Make a crease. Then insert the front cover of the book into the slot created by the paper folded over at the top and the bottom. Slide the paper over the book until you hit the crease.
 Make a crease. Then insert the back cover of the book into the slot created by the paper folded over at the top and the bottom. Slide the paper over the book until you hit the crease.
 If it seems a little loose or the top and bottom folds are not lying flat, you can use small pieces of tape to pull the front and the inside flap together a little more securely.









Do not tape the paper cover to the actual cover of the book; the paper cover will move a little when the book opens, and you could damage the book cover., Remove the book and add stickers, drawings, or designs to the paper. You can add a name tag, or use fancy fonts or scripts to write the title of the book. You can make designs out of paper and attach them with rubber cement or double-sided tape. When you are finished, put the cover back on the book.

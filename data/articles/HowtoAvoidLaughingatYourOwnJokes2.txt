 If you want to tell jokes at parties, you could benefit from preparing some “staple” jokes. If you have some jokes or stories that have been rehearsed (and that you know are funny), you can use these to break the ice. Best of all, the more times you tell a joke, the better it becomes and the less likely you are to laugh.

Think back to the wildest thing that has ever happened to you. Can you tell this story in a humorous way? Be sure to include all the major details, and include one joke or funny outburst every few sentences. Keep your story under 5 minutes.
Another alternative is to think up some thematically appropriate jokes. For example, if you will be attending a non-profit ball, you can try something like, "How many board members does it take to change a light bulb? Response: Six! One to change the light bulb, and five more to divert the founder!"

, Laughing at your own jokes in usually the result of nervousness or feeling awkward. Focus on the experience of telling the joke, and try not to even think about whether or not anyone will laugh. This helps to curb the knee-jerk reaction of nervous laughter following your punchline.You can relax yourself by taking deep breaths. Breath in to a count of 4, 5, or 6, and try to make your exhale the same length.
Alternatively, you can count your breaths. Try to take 10 slow, deep inhales and exhales.
 If the people in your company don’t laugh at your joke, just let it go. Don’t try to encourage them to laugh by explaining the joke, or by laughing maniacally. This only comes off as desperation, and nothing is less funny than that.


Try to believe in your joke. If you believe what you’re saying is funny, other people will hear this in your voice.

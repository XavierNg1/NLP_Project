 Use your hands and a hairbrush to pull your hair back towards the nap of your neck. Try to get it as smooth as possible.
 Use your other hand to pull the elastic off and wrap it tightly around the ponytail.
 Bring both the ribbon and the tail end under the ponytail, and tie them into a tight knot.









How long you cut your ribbon depends on how far you want to wrap it. Plan on cutting the ribbon about twice the length of your ponytail.
You can use any type of ribbon for this, from velvet to suede to satin.
 Grab your ponytail by the base, avoiding the ribbon. Pull your hand downwards, smoothing it. Give it a slight twist to make a thick rope.
 Wrap the ribbon tightly, but keep each "row" 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) apart. You should have something that looks like a spiral.








As you make your first wrap, be sure to tuck the tail end of the ribbon under itself.
 You can cover just a few inches, half of it, three-fourths of it, or even all of it.
 Hold the end of your ponytail with one hand, including the ribbon. Grab another hair tie that matches your hair color, and wrap it tightly around the end of your ponytail and ribbon. This will hold everything together.








For a neater finish, wrap the excess ribbon around the hair tie, then tuck it in under itself.

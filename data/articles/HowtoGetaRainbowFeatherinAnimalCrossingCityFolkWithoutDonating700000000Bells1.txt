, That's how much the rainbow feather will cost. Earn money the short way by selling fruit that you didn't have at the beginning of the game (if your town only had pear trees at the beginning of the game, you'll get only 100 bells per pear). Each fruit is 500 bells so if you had a pocketful of fruit, then you will get 7,500 bells if you sell it to Tom Nook. You can sell coconuts or foreign fruit. To get foreign fruit, read the guide on How to Get Foreign Fruit on Animal Crossing.
 And soon you will get a rainbow feather.

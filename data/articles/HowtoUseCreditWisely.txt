 Credit cards are unsecured loans. Credit cards allow you to use the bank’s money. Many people that use credit cards think of the balance on their card as their money, when in essence, this is the amount of money that the bank is willing to lend you. Everything that you borrow must be paid back with interest. Credit cards cost lots of money to use. It will amaze you, but a person that borrows 5 grand in a year and then pays off the minimum balance will be paying off the debt for over 10 years and with significant interest. In many cases it can cost you twice as much for the item once interest costs are added on.;
, This is not true. Always be responsible with your credit cards. You can build a very decent credit history with just one or two credit cards over the years. You don’t need to take out every conceivable loan in order to show creditors that you can pay them back on time. In fact, too many credit cards or loans can work against you.
 Credit cards give the user the illusion of being able to afford an item when in fact the opposite is true. Just because you are carrying around an unsecured loan of $5K does not mean that you should spend it on luxuries. If you are impulsive then you will find that credit cards can be your worst enemy. Never spend the balance on your credit cards for items that you know you won’t be able to pay back in the short term. Only use credit for convenience or when an emergency arises.

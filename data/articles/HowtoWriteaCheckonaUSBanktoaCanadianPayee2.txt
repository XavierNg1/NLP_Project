Make sure you know what options are available before writing the check. If you are writing many checks and are hit with fees, sometimes as much as $40 dollars per check, this can really affect your bottom line. You will also want to know whether the receiver will have to pay a fee so you can accommodate for this in your transaction.
 Every bank will have their own regulations, but there can be a holding period before the funds are released, sometimes as much as 28 days. If you are making a time-sensitive payment, make sure you know the holding period of both the Canadian recipient, and your own bank. If both banks have a waiting period, these will need to be taken into account. If you are in a time-sensitive situation, you may want to look into other methods like wiring the money, credit cards, or online services like PayPal.
 Sometimes you may think you're paying a certain amount to the payee, but the conversion rate will make the payment too much or not enough. Make sure you understand how the cross border payment will affect the amount using a calculator that is current on conversion rates. Sometimes conversion rates can be beneficial or detrimental to a deal depending on the valuation of respective currency.

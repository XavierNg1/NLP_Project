 You will want to remove any items which make a room or home look dated. Flamingos, hula girl lamps, plastic furniture coverings, and other similar items will make buyers feel like they walked into their grandparent’s house. Remove items like these and, if you can, replace them with more up-to-date items.
 Make sure that you are using the space in your home effectively. Rearrange furniture, replace large pieces with smaller ones, use smart storage solutions, and reduce the amount of furniture in a room to make the space seem larger and more functional.
 Yellow or green fridge and stove? Not most people’s idea of an attractive kitchen. People won’t want to buy a house that they feel looks dated and appliances like these will go a long way towards dating a home. They also won’t want to have to worry about replacing appliances as soon as they move in. To combat this, replace the appliances with something more modern. Be sure that the new appliances match each other.

 You'll need:









5 cups water
2 1/2 cups salt
3 tablespoons cream of tartar
food coloring, optional
10 tablespoons vegetable oil
5 cups flour

, Place them in a large saucepan and stir till well combined.
 Stir the mixture constantly over medium-low heat until the mixture is hot. Then, stir in the vegetable oil.
 Add one cup of flour at a time and stir really well after each cup you add. The mixture will be sticky and shaggy. Just keep stirring.
 The dough will start pulling away from the side of the pan. Turn off the heat and scoop the clay onto a dry surface.
 Once the clay is cool enough to handle, knead the clay until it's smooth.

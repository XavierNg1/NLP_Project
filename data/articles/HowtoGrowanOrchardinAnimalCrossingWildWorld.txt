 Use the Axe if there are trees in your way.;
, You can obtain them through wifi and ds to ds if you pick them from others towns. You could also send a letter to a resident in your town which has your native fruit attached. They may then send a non-native fruit (or a shirt) back, that is, if your letter is only 1 row long. For example you could send the letter with the line "This is a fruit gift." and they would happily send you either a fruit or shirt back.
 Hopefully, in 5 days, the tree should have grown and bear fruit.


If the tree wilts, water it and wait another day to see if it perks up. If not, dig it up and start the tree over with another piece of fruit. (Note: This will restart the whole process)

, Just 1 tree of non native fruit is 1,500 bells! Sell it to Nook and rake in the cash!

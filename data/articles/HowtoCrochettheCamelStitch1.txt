 Start by making a chain appropriate for the length of your project.The length of the chain will depend on the gauge of your yarn as well as on the types of project you want to create.


For example, if you are creating a blanket with a 10mm hook and bulky weight yarn, then you will need to make a chain of 178 or more.;
, For the second row, skip the first stitch in your chain and then start your half-double crochet on the second stitch.Then, continue to half-double crochet to the end of the row.


To half-double crochet, loop the yarn over the hook before you insert it into the back stitch (top stitch furthest from you) and then loop the yarn over the hook again. Pull this yarn through the back stitch, then yarn over again and pull this loop of yarn through the other three loops on your hook., For the third row, first chain two stitches and then half-double crochet into the third loop. The third loop is on the back side of your stitches. Half-double crochet into this third loop.To locate the third loop, count three stitches moving from the front to the back. The first is the front stitch (the one closest to you and nearest the top), the second is the back stitch (right next to the front stitch), and the third stitch is right behind the back stitch.
Continue to HDC to the end of the row.
 For the next row, you will be half-double crocheting into the front stitch, which is the top stitch closest to you. First, chain two and then HDC. Continue to HDC to the end of the row., To complete your project you will simply be alternating your rows between half-double crocheting into the third loop and half-double crocheting into the front loop. Continue to crochet in this fashion until you have achieved the desired length.

 Click the “Traffic” button on the header toolbar of the map, and the streets will be color-coded based on the traffic situation on them. You can see four different levels of traffic through the colors: 1) green for light traffic, 2) yellow for light-to-moderate traffic, 3) orange for moderate-to-heavy traffic, and 4) red for heavy traffic. If you see all green lines, this means the traffic is very light and you will have an easy time traveling through them. If you see red lines, this means your travel would be very slow as there will be lots of cars in the area.


There will also be warning signs on areas with possible traffic disruptions, such as scheduled constructions, accidents, road blocks, and others. These should aid you in planning your routes.

 Example: the equation 6X^2 -11X - 35 = 0 has 2 roots in opposite signs.






If a and c have same sign, the 2 roots have same sign






If a and b have opposite signs, both roots are positive. The equation: 21x^2 - 23x + 6 = 0 has 2 real roots, both positive.






If a and b have same sign, both roots are negative. Example: the equation 15x^2 + 22x + 8 = 0 has 2 real roots, both negative.
 Their product should equal to (c/a), meaning c = c1c2 and a = a1a2.






Their sum is: (c1/a1) + (c2/a2) = (c1a2 + c2a1)/a1a2 = -b/a.






The sum c1a2 + c2a1 is called the Diagonal Sum of a root pair.


The Diagonal Sum of a TRUE root-pair must equal to (-b).






If it equals to (b), the answer is opposite in sign.






If a is negative, the above rule is reversal in sign.



In this case, the diagonal sum becomes the sum of the 2 real roots. Solving results in finding 2 number knowing their sum (-b) and their product (c).





;
, Solve: x^2 - 9x + 14 = 0.


Solution. Both roots are positive. Write down all factor-pairs of c = 14. They are:






(1, 14),(2, 7). This second sum is: 2 + 7 = 9 = -b. The 2 real roots are: 2 and 7







, Solve: x^2 + 27x + 50 = 0.


Solution. Rule of Signs shows that both roots are negative. Write down all factor pairs of c = 50: (-1, -50),(-2, -25)...Stop! This sum is -27 = -b. The 2 real roots are: -2 and -25.
 SolveÂ : -x^2 - 26x + 56 = 0.


Solution: Roots have opposite signs, a is negative. Factor pairs of ac = -56. They are:






(-1, 56),(-2, 28)... Stop!. This sum is: 28 - 2 = 26 = -b. According to the Rule when a is negative, the answer is opposite to the second set. The real roots are: 2, -28.
 Solve: x^2 + 34x - 72 = 0.


Solution. Roots have opposite signs. a is positive. Write down all factor pairs of -72. Stop when you find the sum = b (or -b).






(-1, 72), (-2, 36)...Stop!. The sum of this set is 34 = b.






The answer is opposite to this set. Two real roots are 2 and -36.
 When a = 1, solving quadratic equation in the form x^2 + bx + c = 0 by the Diagonal Sum Method is simple, fast and doesn't require factoring.

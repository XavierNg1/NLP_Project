 Use one cup (236.6 ml) of water, a teaspoon (4.93 ml) of dish soap and a teaspoon of baking soda. Mix the ingredients together until they are well-combined and the baking soda is dissolved.If this does not make enough solution, then just double or triple the recipe.
 Make sure the gold is fully submerged in the solution. Let the gold set in the solution for 20 to 30 minutes., Use a new (or unused) soft bristled toothbrush to do this. Scrub the gold with the toothbrush until all of the built-up dirt and grime are removed.Only scrub the gold if the solution did not remove the built-up dirt and grime.
Avoid scrubbing your gold too hard; you may scratch the gold by scrubbing it too hard.
 Place your gold under warm running water. Rinse the gold thoroughly until all of the solution is removed. Use a soft cloth to dry the gold thoroughly until all the water is removed.This method is safe to use on gold pieces that contain diamonds.
This method is not safe for gold that contains pearls.

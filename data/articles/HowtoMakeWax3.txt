 As it does, it will rise to the surface of the water. When it is completely cooled, it will form a hard white disc on the water's surface.









Cover the bowl with a piece of cling film to prevent possible accidents during this cooling period.
Consider placing the bowl in the refrigerator to speed up the cooling process.
 The hardened wax should lift easily from the bowl in one or two pieces. Carefully release the wax from the bowl and rinse it with cold water. The liquid remaining in the bowl can then be discarded.









The wax may be sticky on the side that was facing the water. Use an old knife or metal can to scrape it off and throw it away.
Don't pour anything that touched the wax, including the water, down the sink. The wax residue can clog the pipes. Strain the water through a cheesecloth and pitch it outside, then throw the cheesecloth and wax away.
 You can store the wax whole or cut it into smaller pieces. Place the wax in a clean Ziploc and store it in the freezer for up to 30 days. Label the outside of the bag to prevent possible confusion.

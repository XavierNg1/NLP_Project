 Combine the bananas, butter, and brown sugar in a large skillet. Heat the mixture over medium heat; stirring constantly to avoid the ingredients burning, but until the sugar is dissolved in the butter. Add the rum to the skillet and continue mixing for an additional two minutes.;
, To avoid splattering, you can lay the individual banana slices in the middle of the tortillas and then carefully drizzle the sauce on top.
 You'll want to securely enclose the mixture inside the tortilla.


Lift up the bottom portion (closest to you) over the mixture.
Layer the two sides inwards onto the bottom flap.
Roll the tortilla tightly away from you to make the form of a burrito.
 Be sure to leave at least an inch (2.57 cm) of space at the top, to avoid splattering and overloading the skillet. Fry the chimichangas for about a minute or two on each side.
, You can also sprinkle a pinch of cinnamon sugar on top as a garnish.

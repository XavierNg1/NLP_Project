 The backup process may take a while, so it's best to have your iPhone connected to a power source before starting.
 The backup may be quite large, and can eat up all of your mobile data in one swoop. Connect your iPhone to a Wi-Fi network before beginning the backup process.


Open the Settings app and tap "Wi-Fi." Select the network you want to connect to and enter the password.
 This will open your iCloud settings for your iPhone.


If you aren't logged in with your Apple ID, tap "Sign In" and log in. You'll need to be logged in with an Apple ID in order to save your backup data to your iCloud storage.
 You'll have to scroll a little to find it.
 This will enable automatic backups to iCloud. This needs to be enabled in order to start the backup process.
 This may take a while, depending on how much data you are backing up.


The iCloud backup process will not back up anything already stored in iCloud, such as your contacts, calendars, and iCloud Photo Library.
If you don't have enough storage available on your iCloud account, you won't be able to create a backup.
 Since iCloud storage is limited, you can control what is stored in your backup, as well as delete old backups you don't need anymore:


Open the Settings app and select "iCloud."
Tap "Storage" and then "Manage Storage."
Tap the backup that you want to manage.
Toggle off any apps that you don't want to back up data for. You'll be prompted to confirm, and then that data will be deleted from the backup.
Tap "Delete Backup" to delete the entire backup from iCloud.
 To restore an iCloud backup, you'll need to erase your iPhone and set it up as new, then restore the backup:


Open the Settings app and select "General."
Scroll to the bottom and tap "Reset."
Tap "Erase All Content and Settings" and then confirm.
Wait while your phone erases and resets.
Proceed through the Setup Assistant and select "Restore from and iCloud Backup" when prompted.

 For example, say, "Arthritis is a disease that makes joints get inflamed. You know when you scraped your knee last week and it got red and puffy? Well, arthritis makes joints - like knees and elbows - always red and puffy." Make sure your child understands everything you are saying, and adjust your vocabulary to accommodate his/her age and maturity.;
, A kid with arthritis may get frustrated because they can't always do the things other kids can. It is okay to have these feelings of frustration and kids with arthritis can also be very happy. They should be treated just like other kids.
, Say things like, "If a person has arthritis, they may not be able to run as fast or keep up with everyone else. That's okay though, because there are many things children with arthritis can do.
 This will create a positive inspiration and will motivate them to be the best that they can be even with arthritic joints.
 If they ask, "Why me?", remind them that it will shape who they are.
, Some kids may become ill or sick from treatments, or they may have to take lots of medicine and get lots of shots.

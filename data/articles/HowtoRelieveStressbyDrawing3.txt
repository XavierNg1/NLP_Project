 Music can powerfully affect your mood by relaxing and inspiring you. Consider your music selection. Soft, rhythmic music (ideally without lyrics) will be especially effective in putting your mind at ease.


Vary the music depending on your mood – faster music can energize you as long as it doesn’t distract you or make you uncomfortable.
Play songs you know well. Lyrics can be welcome if you already know them. Singing along or mouthing the words without thinking can have a calming effect that distracts you from whatever has been stressing you out.
 You don’t need to achieve a certain level of ability to benefit from the mood-improving and calming aspects of drawing, but getting better can make drawing even more rewarding.Community colleges often have low cost classes taught by well-qualified teachers, and classes often meet in the evenings.
Lots of communities also have arts councils that will also offer fun-oriented, open-enrollment classes in drawing and other creative mediums.
 Keep at least a note pad and pen or pencil with you so you can draw whenever inspiration (or stress) strikes. As you go about your day, jot down ideas of what you’d like to draw later on. Simply visualizing yourself drawing will both calm you down and increase the satisfaction you derive once you get the chance to do so!

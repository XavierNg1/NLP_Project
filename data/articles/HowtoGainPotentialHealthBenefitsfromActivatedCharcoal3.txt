 Activated charcoal keeps your body from absorbing certain things. Therefore, if you take it with your normal medication, you may not actually absorb any of it. Make sure to wait at least 2 hours after taking activated charcoal to take any of your medications., Some people swear by activated charcoal for a hangover. However, charcoal doesn't actually bind with alcohol, so it doesn't do much for a hangover. The alcohol will just stay in your body., If you notice that you have pain in your stomach after taking charcoal, call your doctor soon. Swelling in the stomach is another rare side effect that requires medical attention.Less serious side effects include diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting, which don't necessarily need medical attention, though you should stop using the activated charcoal.

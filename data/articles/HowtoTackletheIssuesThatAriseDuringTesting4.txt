 Testing is done not only to ensure quality but to validate whether the product that is being developed is in sync with the userâ€™s requirements. So if the requirements are unclear, incomplete, general and less than perfect, problems are bound to happen.
 The quality of a product can be guaranteed only if the requirements are clear, complete, detailed, cohesive, attainable, and above all testable.


So it is highly essential that there should be flawless access to latest info and also business requirements.
Not only that, the team developing requirements and the team performing the test should work hand in hand so that the testing process goes off without any glitch and the expected results are obtained.

 Sometimes, small changes can make a big impact in how much time you're spending online. Simply rearranging the desktop on your computer can help. Get rid of shortcuts that take you to games or websites you enjoy. Keep your laptop or computer out of your bedroom so it's not the first thing you think of in the morning. These are minor changes, but they can help you avoid temptation., Any small thing you can do to delay gratification can deter you from using your computer. When you're not using your computer or laptop, turn it off. If you know you have to wait for it to power up again before use, you may be less likely to spend a spare 10 minutes online., If you have a smart phone, it may encourage the temptation to use your computer. Checking the internet and your social media profiles might tempt you to open up your laptop. Simply scheduling some time away from the phone can help lessen your computer usage.


Make a rule about no phones out during mealtimes, even if you eat alone.On occasion, go for a walk without your phone. If possible, attend a social event and leave your phone at home.
 Oftentimes, big commitments are hard to maintain. Change takes time and you may not go from being a computer junkie to spending 2 hours a day technology free. If you're struggling to make a transition, try making small 5 to 15 minute commitments.


Promise yourself you'll take a 15 minute walk 3 times a week. Try to honor this commitment no matter what occurs. This may feel more doable than a goal like, "I'll spend an hour a day working out instead of using the computer."Scheduling tiny pockets of time can add up. You may find you enjoy your 5 minutes away from your laptop and you'll begin to naturally desire to spend more time offline.

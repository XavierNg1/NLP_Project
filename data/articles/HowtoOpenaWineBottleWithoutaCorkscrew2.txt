 The blade has to fit easily into the neck of the bottle. You can also try using a serrated knife so that it grips the cork better.Exercise caution when using a knife. Make sure not to cut yourself.
 Carefully work the knife back and forth into the cork, using very little downward pressure. It should go all the way through the cork., With the blade buried in the cork, twist the knife with a slight pull, and slowly work it out. Be careful not to break off pieces of the cork into your wine.
 Use the knife to pry the cork out from the side. Carefully insert the knife between the edge of the cork and the bottle. Apply slow, even pressure on the cork by pulling the knife towards you so that its blade moves inward, like a lever.









If applying pressure from the side, it works best to grip the bottleneck with your free hand slightly below the knife.

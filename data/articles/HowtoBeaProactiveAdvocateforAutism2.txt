 If your community lacks outspoken autistic people, you can step up to open the floor. Start by researching events and groups in other communities that have been successful. Think about what type of leader your community will embrace as an autism advocate, as well as what kind of representation autistic people want to see.
 Whether you decide to host a social gathering, participate in an already established local event, support local autistic artists and business owners, or any other form of advocacy, you have to commit. If you aren't sure how to handle it, look for advice on running events, fundraisers, advertising, and any other aspects of your activity.
 Whenever you start a new activity, it can be exciting to throw yourself into it. However, don't lose sight of your original goal. Once you find autistic people in your community, encourage them to contribute or advise on your efforts. Delegating can be hard, and it's important to think about how much you can do to avoid micromanaging.


This is especially important if you are autistic yourself. Your feelings may be difficult for you to understand, so you may not realize that you have hit your limit.

 Cut the food you don’t like into the smallest pieces you can so that you don’t have to chew as much and you can mix it in easier with other foods. You might even be able to swallow pieces whole, but be careful not to swallow too-large or hard pieces that might get stuck in your throat.;
, Surround the food you don’t like with other food you do like on your plate. If you don’t like asparagus, for example, you could push it into a ball of mashed potatoes before putting it in your mouth. Also try simply putting a bite of something you like in your mouth and holding it there as a sort of barrier for your taste buds before you put in a bite of the bad food.
 Sip from a glass of water, soda, juice, or alcohol right before you take a bite, and then take another sip directly after to replace the taste quickly and help wash the food down.
 Add salt and pepper, butter, some lemon juice, ketchup or mustard, or anything else available on the table. Be careful not to noticeably overdo on your seasonings, or ask for something that’s not already available or would clearly not go with the dish, to avoid offending the cook or your fellow diners.
 Breathe in through your nose before taking a bite of the offending food, then try not to breathe in or out while you’re chewing and swallowing to dampen the flavor.
 Don’t feel like you need to eat the entire quantity of the food you don’t like at a dinner party or other social situation. Eat enough that it appears that you’ve enjoyed most of it and are just too full to have the rest. Leave small amounts of other foods on your plate too, so that it doesn’t look like you neglected one thing.

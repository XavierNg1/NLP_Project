 A small corner of your room, your empty walk in closet, or an empty guest room will all work!;
, If you have a small space, like a corner of your room, it is best to just do 1-5. A medium space, like a walk in closet, can house 6-10 bears. And a large space, like an empty guest room, will house anywhere from 11-60 bears, depending on the size of the room.
 If cardboard boxes are going to be the houses, it is best to go with something such as a Beanie Baby. If your city is in your walk in closet, best not chose the 10-Foot teddy bear you won at the fair last week. And even if you have a huge room that your city will be in, try not to use the 10-foot bear, as it will hog up the whole room! Your city will look neater if all of your inhabitants are the same size (18 inch, 12 inch, etc)


Conclusion - Rooms, bears, and sizing all come to mind when choosing an appropriate population for your city.

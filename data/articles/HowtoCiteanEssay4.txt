 Just like in MLA, the Chicago Author-Date style inserts a parenthetical citation at the end of the sentence, before the period. But the information included in the parenthetical is more like APA: author, date, and page number. There is no punctuation between the author and date, but the date and page number are separated by a comma:


The worldwide population of bees is in significant decline (Brown 2011, 203).
Brown points out that the worldwide population of bees is in significant decline (2011, 203).
 If you have multiple essays by the same author, the reader should be able to distinguish them by the year you've provided. But, if you have two articles by the same author and published in the same year, you mark them with a letter, like in APA. The letter again corresponds with the alphabetization of the essay titles by first major word: (Smith 2005a, 192).
 The Notes-Bibliography system does not require a bibliography, but the Date-Author system does. Like in MLA or APA, the reference list appears after the text of your essay has finished. The first line of each entry is unindented, while all subsequent lines are indented. Entries are listed in alphabetic order.

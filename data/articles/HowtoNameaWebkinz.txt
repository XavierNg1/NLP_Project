 For example, you get a new Yellow Lab, and you make her a sweetie. Name her "Sweetie Pup" or "Sweet Candy" or just plain "Sweetie" for a good name! Try to base their name off of what you think of them.;
, If you got a Rainbow Armadillo for your birthday, name it "Cupcake" or "Sprinkles" or possibly even "Sugar Cookie" for a fitting name! Try to find one that works very well under all the circumstances. "Cupcake" or "Sprinkles" fits your birthday aspect and the fact that they are rainbow.
 Try babynames.com; they have tons of people names that would be perfect for your Webkinz. How about "Molly" for a Black Lab, "Katie" for an Irish Setter, or "June" for a Pink Pony?

,, Don't forget to enjoy your newly named pet!

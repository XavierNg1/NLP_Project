 Soy milk will usually begin to curdle even if you do not heat it, but to create the maximum amount of curds, you should pour the milk into a saucepan and heat over medium heat until it starts to steam.


Soy milk curdles more easily than standard whole dairy milk, but if you add an acid to the soy milk without heating it first, the resulting curds will be smaller and less firm. Moreover, they will also take longer to form. If you only need the soy milk to sour or become grainy and do not need actual curds, you can skip the heating portion of this method, though.
 Whisk in an acid, like lemon juice, to thoroughly incorporate it. You should notice some curds beginning to form already.


Lemon juice is the recommended acid of choice for curdling soy milk.
On average, you will need about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of lemon juice for every 1 cup (250 ml) of soy milk. Note that adding more acid will cause more prominent curds to form while adding less acid will cause smaller curds or grains to form.
 Remove the saucepan from the heat, if applicable. Let the acid and soy milk combination stand at room temperature for 10 minutes.


If you heated the soy milk before adding the vinegar, you should notice curds beginning to form. If the curds have not reached the desired size or consistency yet, you can let the milk sit longer or return it to the heat for a few minutes.
 If using the soy milk curds for vegan cheese or another similar recipe, you should strain the curds through cheesecloth to separate them from the liquid whey.


Note that you may need to let the whey drain for several hours to a day, depending on how runny your curdled milk is when done.
If you do not need to separate the curds from the whey, you can use the curdled soy milk without straining it.

 Do not peel the potato; this way, your fingers won't get wet as you use it. Keep in mind that you will not be able to rinse these stamps. If you want to use more than one color for a certain shape, you will need to make a new stamp using a new potato for each color that you wish to use.;
, Position a small cookie cutter against the cut side of one potato half. Press the cookie cutter into the potato until it is half way in.You will be cutting around the cookie cutter, so it might be best to choose a simpler design.
 Press the tip of your knife into the side of the potato until it bumps up against the wall of the cookie cutter. Cut your way around the cookie cutter., You should now have raised shape in the center of your potato that is the same shape as your cookie cutter.This is your stamp.
 Choose some blank wrapping paper, such as white or brown craft paper, or butcher paper. Spread the paper down on your work surface, then tape or weight down the corners.
 Acrylic paint or tempera paint will work best for this. If you are using acrylic paint, make sure that you are using the watered-down kind that comes in a bottle. The kind that comes in a tube (like toothpaste) is much too thick for this kind of project.


You can only use one color for these stamps. If you want to use more colors, make more stamps, and put the paint on a separate plate.
 Spread it around until the stamp is coated with a thin layer of paint. Use the edge of a spoon to scrape off any excess paint. If you use too much paint, your design may turn out smudged., Keep pressing your stamp against the paper at various points until your design is complete. Every so often, dip your stamp into the paint to re-ink it. If you want to use a new color, it would be best to make a new stamp.


Create layers and multicolored designs by allowing the paint to dry, then stamping more colors on top.
 Homemade wrapping paper is great for any gift, especially a homemade one.

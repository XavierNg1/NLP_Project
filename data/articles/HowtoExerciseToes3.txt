 Grip a pencil, marble or any other small object with your toes and repeatedly hold it for six seconds before setting it down. This is an easy exercise to do when watching television, reading or working because it does not require much attention.

Take 20 marbles and see if you can drop them into a bowl one at a time for an added workout., Place the towel at your feet and slowly curl it towards you by only using your toes. Repeat this five times for both feet. If you would like to increase the resistance of the towel add some weight to the end of it., Find some rocks (make sure they are not sharp or jagged) that you can walk on comfortably. Your feet will grip the rocks naturally and the changing surface of the rocks will work out the nerves in the feet that actually connect to the lower back, strengthening both.

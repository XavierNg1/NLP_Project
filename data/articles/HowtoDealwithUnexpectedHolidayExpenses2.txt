 The holiday season offers many opportunities to make extra money, as many businesses require extra help during this time. Look at online job boards or company websites to see what part-time positions might be available, and have your CV ready to apply to as many as possible. You’re likely to find work at:


Major retail stores (e.g. Toys “R” Us, Best Buy)
Shipping companies (FedEx or UPS)
Restaurants and bars

, Babysitting services are in high demand during the holiday season, particularly for parents wishing to attend holiday parties or shop for their kids. Advertise locally in churches, community centers, and on bulletin boards of local businesses. You can also advertise on a website that connects babysitters and parents (such as Sittercity).Rates for babysitting can range from $7-10 per hour in smaller towns up to $20 in larger cities like New York.
 If you want quick cash to cover your unexpected holiday expenses, try selling some of your unwanted belongings. Post ads on Craigslist, Ebay, or social media sites (e.g. on Facebook "buy and trade" groups) and be sure to include clear pictures that convey that the items are in good condition. If online resources don't work, you can also opt to sell things at a flea market or yard sale. Renting a table or getting a permit will both cost a fee, but the odds of selling your items are good.For instance, you can try to sell a lamp that no longer fits your decor by posting an ad on Craigslist (with a good picture of the lamp included.)
If you wish to sell a collection of books or DVDs, a yard sale or table at a flea market is an easier option than posting ads for all the individual items in the set.

 You should sanitize all the breast pump parts once each day. To do this, place the parts into a large pot. Completely cover the parts with water. Boil the water, and let the parts stand in the boiling water for 10 minutes.After letting the water cool, remove the parts with tongs. Don’t touch with your hands.
Let the parts air dry.
 If you are going to be pumping on the go, you may want to look into buying breast pump wipes. These wipes are a convenient way to wipe away breast milk and do a quick clean if you don’t have access to water, soap, or a microwave.When you get home, make sure to clean the breast pump well.
You can order these wipes online or purchase them in baby stores.
 Some breast pumps are made so you can put the parts in the dishwasher. Check the manual that came with your breast pump to check if your model is dishwasher safe.If it is dishwasher safe, you can place the parts on the top shelf and wash with the rest of your dishes.
 You can buy microwave sterilizers to use for your breast pump parts. These sterilizers are not FDA-approved for sterilization. However, they will sanitize your breast pump parts so they will be cleaned and ready for use again.Only microwave the parts if the same person is using them. Never microwave between different users. The microwave sterilizer will not adequately sterilize the parts for multiple users.

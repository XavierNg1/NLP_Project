 It is relatively simple, all you have to do is, complete homework on time and be charming. If you already have a bad reputation, do not worry. You will probably be forgiven if you follow most of the steps below.;
, You have to know every nook and cranny. Later in your time in school you may get access to keys. Use this opportunity to check which doors they open, and if necessary, make a map. This would be very useful if you attend a huge school.

 If you're not into sports, volunteer to help in the school-library, computer lab or help with the newsletter. These are relatively simple jobs and can gain you access to much needed materials for Ruling The School.
, You could hang out in the library all day, every day just chatting and playing games on the net. If there is no such place in your school don't be tempted to mitch/skive/ditch school (explained later), as this is really pointless unless you have something to do.
 When you are skipping class, walk into the library without a pass and just smile at them. They'll trust you enough.
 Whilst supervising in the library and computer-lab you may have the power to dish out detentions and kick people out. 'With great power comes great responsibility,' and all that, but swiftly use your power to reprimand students that are being cheeky to you, not necessarily ones that are breaking the rules. This will earn you a sort of respect and the younger students will eventually do your bidding.

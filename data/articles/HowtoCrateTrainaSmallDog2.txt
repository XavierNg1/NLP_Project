 Take the door off of the crate (or prop open the door, if this isn't possible) and allow the dog to explore it freely. If your dog does not approach the crate on its own, try encouraging it in a soothing voice. Drop treats near the entrance to the crate, or toss treats and toys inside to encourage your dog to go in. Be patient and allow your pet to explore at its own pace., If your dog is comfortable enough to enter the crate, begin feeding it regular meals in there to increase positive associations. Place your dog's food dish towards the back of the crate; if your dog has not fully explored the crate yet, place its dish near the front instead. Do this a few times, then close the door while your small dog eats; open the door as soon as it finishes its meal.If the dog cries or whines, shorten this time period and open the door sooner; if your dog seems comfortable, prolong the time to ten minutes after it finishes eating.
 If your dog gets comfortable with the process of eating in its crate, start practicing longer crating periods. Draw it towards the crate with a treat and soothing words; encourage it to enter, then close the door behind it and feed it the treat, offering lots of praise. Sit by the crate for 5-10 minutes, then leave the room and wait another few minutes before returning to let your dog out. Repeat this process several times a day, increasing crating time gradually.

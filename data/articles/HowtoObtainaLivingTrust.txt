Decide if the living trust is a shared or an individual trust. An example of a shared trust is one that includes you, your spouse or a business partner.
Decide who runs your living trust. You can preside over the trust or pick someone to be the trustee. However, be careful to pick a successor trustee to manage the property once you've died.
Select the property you want to include in your living trust such as bonds, real estate, and stocks.
Pick the beneficiaries you want to inherit the assets in your living trust, like friends, charities, or family members. It is also important to list contingent beneficiaries. These beneficiaries would only receive the inheritance if the original person you pick dies before you do.;

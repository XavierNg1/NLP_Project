 A classic blazer can easily dress up a simple shirt and jeans, transforming it from everyday casual to business-casual. Look for a fitted blazer in a traditional color, like black, navy, or deep gray.


Alternatively, look for a blazer in a bright color to add a little spice and personality to your look.
 A belted jacket adds structure to your outfit, easily dressing up even the simplest of shirt/jean combinations.
 When you want to play up your femininity, a fitted cardigan in cream or white is just the thing. Look for a cardigan with feminine details, like faux pearl buttons, in order to make your jeans look even dressier. Consider wearing it over a lacy camisole or another notably girly top.

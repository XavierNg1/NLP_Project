 First, you must know how much 1X stock you want before you can calculate how much 10X stock you will need. The amount to make will be dependent on the type of experiment you are doing.


If you just need an aliquot of 1X stock to have around, make around 500 mL. You can use this 1X stock for a while and won’t have to make it as often.
 To calculate the amount of 10X stock needed, you simply divide your total volume by 10.Remember, to get the correct volume, your units must match: if the volume you are making is in milliliters, the volume you add will be in milliliters.


For example: If you want 500 mL of solution, divide 500 by 10 and you get 50 mL. You need 50 mL of 10X stock to make 500 mL of 1X.
For example: If you want 2 L of solution, divide 2/10 and you get 0.2 L. You can convert this to mL by multiplying by 1000. You need 200 mL of 10X stock to make 2 L of 1X.
 To determine the amount of water needed to dilute the 10X stock, you just need to subtract the calculated 10X volume from the total volume that you want.For example: To make 500 mLs, you need 50 mLs of 10X stock. 500 – 50 = 450, so you need 450 mL of distilled water to dilute.
 Using the volumes that you have calculated, add distilled water to the 10X stock. You have now made a 1X stock of PBS.For example: Add 50 mL of 10X stock to 450 mL of distilled water to make a 1X PBS stock. Swirl the container to mix.
 Sometimes the dilution process affects the pH of the buffer. It is prudent to check the pH of the 1X stock and make sure it is at 7.4 following dilution.Use the pH meter to measure the pH and use HCl or NaOH to correct the buffer to a pH of 7.4.

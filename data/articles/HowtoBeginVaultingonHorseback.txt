 Email or call one of the clubs in your area and a coach will contact you. You can't vault without a horse, a skilled lunger, and a coach.;
, The listserves also have info about horses and barrels for sale. A Vaulting Barrel is what vaulters practice on when they don't have a horse, or the horse is tired. It's also a great way to learn skills correctly before you get on the horse.
, Get your shoes at Pegasus Vaulting Supply--you can order on line.

 Here are some things you may want to focus on; eye color, hair color, height, shoe size, type of clothing, etc. Looks are not everything! Of course it's nice to have a boyfriend with all the right features but do not look blindly past men or guys that don't pass all the tests. No ones perfect.;
, Here are some classes to consider; sporty, popular, musical, smart, funny, kind, shy, etc. Do not be fooled though; just because a person isn't a popular or sporty as you wanted them to be doesn't mean they can't be. However, don't try to change a person and two opposites may attract so try think out side of your comfort zone.
 Here are some personalities to try; artistic, funny, kind, calm, overprotective, organized, athletic, etc. Notice the personalities may also seem like "types", but this does not mean the same rules apply. Personalities are something to take into deep consideration; you may have one or two personalities you like but someone else may have a wide variety. Not having a lot is not a bad thing, and having a lot isn't either. Just remember either way it's better to be picky about certain personalities.
 With every pro should come a con so they should both be about equal. Prepare to be frustrated in the lack of hope you may have in your perfect guy after.
 They will not appreciate it and you will not appreciate it if they aren't what you expect, so don't do it. And if you really have to, compare them in the beginning of your relationship. You may even be surprised to figure you out your soul mate is not your perfect guy. That's okay. No one is perfect anyway!

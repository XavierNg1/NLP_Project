 Get onto your pegs and start going slowly on flat ground.
 Bunny Hop with Seat Pinch with Hand Spin!!


Have all your pads and safety gear on. Even more important than normal.
Do not look at the ground! Look at the handlebars.
 Catch the bars when they come around and slowly lean forward and step back onto the pedals.
 Take it easy on the landing until you get it. The slow lean forward it key.
 Practice doing your bar spin going faster, with a higher bunny hop, or on a ramp.

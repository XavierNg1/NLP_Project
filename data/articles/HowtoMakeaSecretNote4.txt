 Choose a short passage, making sure that every letter in the alphabet is used to begin a word in the passage. If it’s too hard to find one with any Xs and Zs, you can write your own.


Number each of the words. Starting with the first word in the passage, count the words and then number them left to write. It should look like: “A1 fine2 day3 to4 go5 out6 running7…”, etc.
Write your message using the numbers. In the example, A = 1, F = 2, D = 3, 4 = T, 5 = G, 6 = O and 7 = R. To spell the word “far”, you’d write 217.
Share the passage with your friends. Leave it un-numbered, and have them count the letters mentally. To everyone else, the key will look like a normal paragraph, and no one will know it’s the key to a code.
 Like a passage cipher, you’ll use the words in the book to make up the words of your message. You’ll make up a rule that determines how the words are found, and this will be used to transmit them message.Pick your book. This should be a common book that both you and the receiver of the message own. It must be the exact same edition so that the words and pages are in exactly the same places.
Determine your method. Book ciphers often use three numbers separated by commas to denote information. (100,28,5) might mean that the target word is on the 100th page, the 28th line and the 5th word in that line.
Write your messages using the method. Your “words” will be made up of groups of numbers and almost impossible to break. Book ciphers are so difficult to crack because to break it, someone will have to know and possess the exact edition of the book you used.

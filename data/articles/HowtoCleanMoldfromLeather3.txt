 Using a stiff nylon brush, dry brush the material to remove as much mold and mildew from the surface as you can. Mold spores spread easily so try to do this outdoors so you don’t spread the mold., Mix equal parts vinegar and water and test the solution on a tiny part of the material. If the colour doesn’t change, continue to clean the mold off with the mixture. Do not over saturate the material., Dip a soft cloth in the vinegar mixture and gently clean the material. Do not use force as you may damage it. Set the material aside and let dry.


This method commonly works well for leather shoes but can be applied to other leather goods as long as you test how the vinegar mixture affects it to make sure there is no discoloration.

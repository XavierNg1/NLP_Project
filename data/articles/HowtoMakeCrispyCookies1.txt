 Flour, eggs and brown sugar all hold on to moisture, leading to fluffy moist cookies. If you are look for a crispier treat, try using less of these three ingredients., All-purpose flour has a higher protein content compared to other flours. Extra protein helps create a browner appearance and crispier texture., This will allow the cookies time to spread before they firm. It will also help dry out your cookies as well., Compared to shortening, butter has a lower melting temperature. This will allow your cookies to spread more during baking. Butter also has protein in it, which helps with browning and crisping., Avoid using brown sugar, which holds on to moisture, and instead use a processed sugar. This will lead to a drier and crispier cookie., Eggs hold a lot of moisture and, when cooked, they release lots of steam. This steam acts as a leavening agent, making cookies moist and fluffy. You will get a flatter, thinner and crispier cookie without eggs.You can substitute applesauce instead of an egg, but applesauce also has a lot of moisture in it.You could also try out vegetable oil.

 The software development field has excellent job growth. Software engineering is a particularly desirable focus compared to basic programming. Median software developer income is roughly $80,000 â€“ $100,000 a year in the United States., Practical software design and coding should be your first priorities. There are a variety of ways to earn this experience:Teach yourself programming through online tutorials or friends willing to teach you.
Take a massive open online course (MOOC).
If you already have some experience, collaborate with other programmers on GitHub.
A coding bootcamp is one of the fastest ways to learn, if you're willing to invest money and free time.
 Software may be a specialized subject, but your previous career doesn't have to involve computers to give you an edge. Software engineering can rely heavily on analytic skills, problem solving, and teamwork. In addition, familiarity with an industry may help you design software for that industry.


Even hobbies and side interests can ope up networking opportunities, or at least add passion to your job. Game apps, digital music suites, or business software are all examples

, It's very possible to land a programming job after a year or two of side experience, or even a few months with enough dedication. However, a "proper" engineering job, where you're responsible for designing software rather than just coding it, typically requires a bachelor's degree. If you already have a bachelor's in any subject, along with some coding skills, consider going straight for a master's in software engineering.
 Almost every industry needs software developers, so your network from a previous career can be invaluable. Also consider joining a professional association, such as IAENG Society of Software Engineering, the IEEE Computer Society Technical Council on Software Engineering, or the Association for Computing Machinery.

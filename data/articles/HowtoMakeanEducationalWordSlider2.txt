 Make sure your handwriting is legible and don’t write in cursive (italicized writing).


Use a variety of three-letter words so that the student learns different word groups and sounds (groups of “op” like mop or pop and “at” such as pat or sat).

Fold the top portion downward to join the bottom half.
Run a piece of clear tape along the bottom and top halves to join the paper together.
 Keep the stack of index cards facing down so the student cannot see what word is coming next.

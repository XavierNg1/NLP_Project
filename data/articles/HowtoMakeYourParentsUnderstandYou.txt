 Make sure they know that you care.;
, It's difficult being a teen. Studying at school all day and the constant pressure of peers always competing to be the best is exhausting. Everyone needs 'me' time.
 Contribute to household chores and offer to take care of siblings. Parents need a break as well.
 Give them something to keep them happy. Let them know what school's like for you, name a few friends and if you're interested in someone, let them know. Parents are happy knowing that you're happy, so acknowledge them in a small way. By doing this, parents will know that when you don't want to talk, it's fine. The parent should understand that you just simply want to be left with some privacy.
, It's not fair and they were once kids as well. Let them know you will help them where you can. For your parents to understand you, you have to talk. No one is born with a set of instructions, so open up.
 Even if you don't think your parents care, someone somewhere does. You can sort the problem out, and who knows? You might start helping others as well.

 Even if your friend did something bad to you, don’t talk badly about them to your mutual friends. Never make your friends pick between the two of you, as this will put them in an impossible situation, and you might find that they won’t choose you.Say instead “I want you to know that you don’t have to choose sides. I have been friends with you for a while, too and I really want to maintain our friendship.”

, Improve from what you learned at the end of this friendship. Though this end could be because of something bad your old friend did, acknowledge any role that you played, as well. Work to be a better friend and choose better friends in the future.Always be loyal and honest with your friends.
 Though you likely had many mutual friends, spend some time with those that you did not have in common. Though you should not forsake your mutual friends, they will serve as strong reminders of the friendship that you lost, and that could delay the healing process.


Connect with family, as well.
 Though being around people during this time is good, spending time alone will be instrumental in your healing. Avoid making plans with people every single day, and opt for every other day instead.

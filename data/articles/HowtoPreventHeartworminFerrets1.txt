 Heartworm is transmitted by mosquitos. If a mosquito bites an animal that is infected with heartworm and then bites your ferret, your ferret may become infected as well. If you do want to take your ferret outdoors, try to avoid doing so during warm, moist weather when mosquitos are most numerous. Further, avoid taking your ferret outside at dawn and dusk, when mosquitos are most active.Heartworm is most common in the U.S. within 150 miles (241 km) of the Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico and along the Mississippi River. However, heartworm has been found in every U.S. state.;
, Do not leave doors or windows open unless they are screened. Repair any damage to screens as soon as it occurs. If you need motivation to do so: people can be infected with heartworm too (though adult heartworms are usually unable to develop in human bodies).Take it for granted that some mosquitos will get into your home. They may even survive in certain areas of your home year-round. Be sure to clean eaves, crawlspaces, and attics regularly if you have pets., While DEET is a standard ingredient in many bug sprays designed for human use, DEET is extremely dangerous for your pet. Avoid spraying your ferret with any bug spray designed for use on humans. Similarly, don't use bug spray meant for dogs. There are several natural bug sprays designed for use on pets. They are available online and at most pet stores. Before using these sprays, check with your vet to make sure they're safe., Though medications that can kill adult heartworms do exist, they are especially dangerous for ferrets. These medications are even dangerous for larger animals, such as cats and dogs, as heartworms killed by the drugs can clog arteries. Since ferrets have especially small blood vessels, this risk is even greater. In short, take great care in preventing your ferret from becoming infected with heartworm, as treatment is challenging and dangerous.

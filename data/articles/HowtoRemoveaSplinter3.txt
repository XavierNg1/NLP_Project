 You can also use glue, such as white school glue, to remove a splinter. Just apply a layer of glue to the splinter and surrounding area.Make sure that the glue is thick enough to fully cover the splinter.


Do not use instant glue. This may not come off of your skin and trap the splinter in your skin instead of removing it.You can also try using a wax hair remover or wax strips the same way that you would use glue.Wash and dry your hands and the area around your splinter before you begin.
 The glue must dry completely before you can remove it or it may not stick to the splinter. Leave the glue on your skin for about 30 minutes to an hour. Check it now and then to see if it is dry yet. When the glue is dry, it should not feel tacky or wet.
 After you are certain that the glue is dry, grasp the edge of the glue and pull it in the direction that the splinter entered your skin. Pull slowly and evenly. As you pull at the glue over your splinter, the splinter should come out.
 After you have peeled away the glue, look at the glue to see if the splinter is stuck in it. You should also check to see if any parts of the splinter are left in your skin. If so, then you may need to repeat the process or try a different splinter removal method.

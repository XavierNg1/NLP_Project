 Inspect the age and quality of your bear. Also check the materials from which it is made, as well as those that adorn it. Since a machine-wash will be much rougher on the toy than a hand-wash, err on the side of caution and hand-wash it if you determine that your bear might not survive the machine. Do not machine-wash the following:Old teddy bears, those that are delicate by design, and those that have become fragile due to lots of use.
Bears that are made of wool, mohair, alpaca fur, or rayon.
Any with attached add-ons like sequins, buttons, or eyes that have been glued on.
 If your bear has any clothes than can be removed, take them off to prevent tangling and to make sure that the bear itself is washed thoroughly. Trim any loose threads and sew up any tears or holes so the problem doesn’t grow any worse during the wash.Give your bear extra protection by closing it within a sealable pillowcase or mesh bag., First, add an appropriate amount of detergent to your washer. Then set the machine’s cycle to “Hand-Wash” or “Delicate.” Finally, select cold or warm water. Then start the wash cycle.Do not use hot water, since this may ruin the bear.
Do not include items that are excessively dirty or whose colors may bleed in the same wash cycle as your bear.

 Find where you saved the downloaded application. This is, usually by default, in your Downloads folder. Or, if you manually saved it, wherever you manually saved it to.


If you are Mac user, it may prompt you to open it as soon as it is downloaded.
 Whatever software you are using should give you instructions on how to successfully install it. It should ask you things like:


Where to save the software -- this means where in your computer’s memory will it be saved. Generally this is a hard drive. These days, many of these programs offer to save information online in the “cloud.”
If you want a desktop shortcut -- this is just a shortcut allowing you to easily access the software.
If you agree to terms of use or end user license agreement (EULA).
 This might include setting up a login name, password, e-mail, etc. Make sure you use secure password.
 Some software allows you to connect your bank accounts directly to the software. This allows for easier transactions reporting.


Banks often have security systems that will not allow automatic syncing unless you talk to your bank representative.

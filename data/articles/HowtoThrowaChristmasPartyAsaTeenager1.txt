 You will probably have to shoulder the responsibility of cleaning, inviting, and preparing, so make sure you're ready.
 Before you go to ask your parents for permission or help, make a list of menu options (such as homemade, catering, bring-your-own-side-dish, etc.), activity options (board games? Holiday movies?), date and time possibilities, and special-case plans (such as what to do with young children, etc.).
 Calmly and respectfully, present your ideas to them and offer them the different options.
 Be careful to consider friendships, rivalries, space constraints, and personal issues (such as extreme shyness or alcoholism).
 It will make it much easier to purchase or make decorations if you already have your theme in mind.
 Depending on your theme, you may wish to host your party earlier or later in the day. Be sure to schedule it before people leave for vacations, and remember work and school hours.
 The best idea may be to host at your home, where you and everyone else will be familiar with the surroundings. However, you may wish to look into renting a small banquet hall or room at a restaurant.
 Be sure to provide a phone number that you can be reached on, and give clear directions. Write neatly!

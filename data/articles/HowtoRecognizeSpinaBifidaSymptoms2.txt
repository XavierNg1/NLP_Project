 During the second trimester (it’s not detectable in the first trimester), at roughly 16-18 weeks, spina bifida is typically detected via the MSAFP which measures something called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Higher levels of AFP are a potential sign of an uncovered neural tube.Keep in mind that the MSAFP test is not 100% accurate, and further tests may be required.
 If your AFP levels are high, then your doctor will probably want to do an ultrasound. An ultrasound can provide images of an unborn baby’s spine and spinal cord, which may enable the doctor to diagnose spina bifida., During amniocentesis, the doctor extracts some amniotic sac fluid that protects the fetus. Using the fluid, the doctor can screen for high levels of AFP. The one downside to this test, however, is that it is not thorough enough to know the degree to which spina bifida has affected the baby., Scans that are postnatal, after the baby is born, are often the only way milder forms of spina bifida are discovered. An x-ray, MRI, or CT scan examination can be performed. This option is used primarily when the spina bifida symptoms are not clearly visible.

 These instructions assume you are running iPhone OS 3.0 or above.
 The app to use on the iPhone is called MobileTerminal and it’s available for free in the Cydia store.
, You’ll be prompted for the ‘old’ (current) password for the mobile user. Enter this as the old password: alpine

, You’ll then be prompted to enter the new password – so just type in your desired new password. Use good password principles if possible (long and strong). You will not see characters appearing on the screen as you type – that’s normal, not a concern.
 You’ll then be prompted to re-enter the new password. Do that.


You should then be returned to the Mobile$ prompt that you started on when opening the MobileTerminal app. There’s no success message to say the password was changed – but if you’re returned to the prompt and do not get an error, the change was successful. And you’re done with change for the mobile account.


Enter this: alpine

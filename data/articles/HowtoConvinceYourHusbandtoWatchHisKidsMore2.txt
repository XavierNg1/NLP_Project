 If you have been the primary caretaker for your kids in the past, your husband may not know how to do things that are second nature to you.


Teach him to give the baby a bottle, braid your daughter’s hair, or cut up carrots for your four-year-old., The idea of taking over solitary childcare duties can be intimidating for someone who isn’t used to doing it. Help your husband get more comfortable watching the kids by having him take care of them when you’re doing housework or reading a book in another part of the house. He’ll feel less nervous knowing you’re just a few rooms away if something goes wrong., If your husband isn’t used to watching the kids, he’ll probably make mistakes with them occasionally. Unless his mistakes could have an impact on the kids’ health or safety, don’t criticize him or step in to take over. Criticism will make him feel discouraged and unhelpful.For instance, if your husband puts the diaper on wrong, you could say in a light-hearted way, "Sweetie, it's on backwards! No worries, though! I've done it myself a few times!"

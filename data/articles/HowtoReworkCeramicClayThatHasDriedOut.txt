, Stirring stops up the porosity and prevents good slaking (soaking to mush).
 In a few days, even the largest chunks of dry clay will turn into mush.
 When the clay has settled and turned to mush, remove extra water from top. Dip water off or siphon it off.
 You can stiffen the mush by allowing it to set for many months with the lid off. To dry it faster, spread the mush a few inches thick on clean dry porous surfaces. You can use dry plaster, clean concrete, canvas or denim. Smooth the top to avoid getting small dry pieces on the surface. For quicker drying, position a fan to blow air across clay.
 When it is nearly dry enough, make coils for future use. This clay can be stored in an airtight plastic, double-wrapping in sandwich bags if you expect to store it an extended length of time.

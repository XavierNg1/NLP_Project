 Isosceles triangles have two equal sides and two equal angles. The equal sides are marked by one hash mark on each of them, indicating that the angles across from each side are equal. If you know the angle measurement of one equal angle of an isosceles triangle, then you'll know the measurement of the other equal angle. Here's how to find it:


If one of the equal angles is 40°, then you'll know that the other angle is also 40°. You can find the third side, if needed, by subtracting 40° + 40° (which is 80°) from 180°. 180° - 80° = 100°, which is the measurement of the remaining angle.
 An equilateral triangle has all equal sides and all equal angles. It will typically be marked by two hash marks in the middle of each of its sides. This means that the angle measurement of any angle in an equilateral triangle is 60°. Check your work. 60° + 60° + 60° = 180°.
 Let's say you know you have a right triangle, with one of the other angles being 30°. If it's a right triangle, then you know that one of the angles measures exactly 90°. The same principles apply. All you have to do is add up the measurements of the sides you know (30° + 90° = 120°) and subtract that number from 180°. So, 180° - 120° = 60°. The measurement of that third angle is 60°.

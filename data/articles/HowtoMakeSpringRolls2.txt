 After heating cooking oil, pan fry garlic and ginger on high setting for thirty seconds.Add onions and green peppers and cook for two minutes.Stir in carrots, cooked noodles, cabbage and saute for another three minutes. Stir the pan often to prevent your ingredients from burning. Once done, remove the pan from the burner.Cut the noodles before adding them to your pan. Cutting your noodles avoids long, stringy pieces from falling out of the roll. Quickly cut your noodles into pieces 2 inches (4 cm) long for most spring rolls., After turning off the heat, add ketchup, salt, and szechuan sauce.Mix the pan well until the liquids have evenly coated the vegetables then set aside the filling until needed.


If you wish to add meat, such as cooked ground pork or roasted shredded chicken, add your precooked meat along with the liquid ingredients.
 Lay out the wrappers in a diamond shape in front of you. Scoop up a spoonful of filling and place it 3/4 of a single wrapper. Take the horizontal ends of the wrapper cover the filling.Using your fingers, tightly tuck the exposed, shorter end over the filling. Roll the filling up in the rest of the wrapper.If youâ€™re having trouble getting your wrapper to seal, mix up a little bit of flour and water. Dip your fingers in the mixture and tap it along the seal of the roll. This will help keep the paper sealed., In a wok or deep pan, heat up a thin layer of oil on medium. Once the oil is crackling, add the spring rolls in. Cook for approximately 2 minutes or until golden roll. Remember to flip the spring roll constantly to ensure it is evenly fried. Once all sides are a beautiful brown color, they are ready.Before and after cooking, store the spring rolls on absorbent paper, such as paper towel. This will help remove any water before cooking. Use a paper towel to remove any excess oil after cooking as well.Try serving your Chinese spring rolls with a side of soya sauce.

 Most washers come with a troubleshooting manual. If your washer is giving you an error code, check to see what the manual says the problem is. The most common error code for long drain time is F9 E1, but your washer may be different. If the manual says your pump needs to be replaced, you need to call a repair man or refer to How to Replace a Washing Machine Water Pump.;
, Remove the drain hose from the back of the washer. Run a moderate to high pressure water stream through it (an outdoor water hose connection works great). If it is clogged, this should force the clog out.


Replace the hose on the machine, ensuring that the outlet the hose goes into is not more than 8 feet (2.4 m) from the floor, that the end of the hose is no more than 4.5 inches (11.4 cm) into the drain hole, that the drain hole is not taped shut, and that the hose is not kinked or bent. These can all affect your drain time.
 If it drains, you are done. If it doesn't, proceed to step 4.
 First, unplug the machine. Then find out where the pump is located on your machine. It is usually in the back for top loaders and in the front below the door for front loaders. You may have to remove a panel to get to it. When you find the pump, there will be a section that is round with an oval handle in the center. It will probably be white plastic.
 Don't be afraid to apply pressure, it is a very tight seal. Make sure you have a bucket and towels ready to catch any water that gushes out. Inside, you will probably find a lot of lint, some change, and possibly some small pieces of cloth or socks.
 Stick your finger in the hole to the right of the screen and make sure nothing is caught in the pump fan and that it moves freely, then replace the filter, turning it clockwise until it is tight, and then replace any panels you removed.
 Your washer should drain quickly. If it does not, your pump needs to be replaced, in which case you can call a repair man or refer to How to Replace a Washing Machine Water Pump.

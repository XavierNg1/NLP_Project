 Once the chicks are dry it’s important to raise them in a brooder for the first four to six weeks of their lives to ensure that they are safe, warm and are being kept healthy.
 Chick starter provides more protein than a quail's average feed and should be given to your chicks for six to eight weeks to keep them healthy.
 Fill the water bowl daily and make sure that it isn’t too deep for your chicks as they can fall in and drown. A common trick is to put pebbles/stones is the water bowl to make it shallower.


Remember to clean the water bowl once a week to prevent diseases and the water from getting dirty.
 Depending on the amount of chicks you have and how old they are, it’s important to clean the brooder often as the waste can cause serious disease to your chicks.

 Especially when management or a CSM (Customer Service Manager) is walking around, you don't want them catching you playing around with a cell phone or MP3 player.
 You don't have to say "Welcome to Walmart!" if you think it sounds cheesy, instead, you can say "Hello, how are you?" or "how are you doing?" instead., Throughout the day you may have to peel those little "happy faces" off the roll and applying them to various customers throughout the day. Your fingers/hands will likely take an abuse so make sure you properly stretch and exercise the fingers. NOTE: most customers will not want a sticker so your next option would be to tear a few off the roll of stickers., You should always check anyway, but do not overdo this, you don't want to stress yourself out if you miss a few customers here or there, this will happen and this is normal. Some rush out the door, some stop and hand you a receipt if you ask them, and some customers are angry either way, so be careful., If you do not have one of these, just write them up. Write your initials, the date, how many items they have and you should be golden., Basically whatever you can do to keep yourself from being bored. Remember that management will be watching you and, whatever you can do to help them out will be a really big help to them, because they have a lot of responsibility, so you should treat this job as important as any other., This is by far the easiest job in the store. You have it made, and you're making money to stand around, even more overnight. Not too shabby. It is going to get boring, but my suggestion to you would be to grin and bear it until something better comes your way.

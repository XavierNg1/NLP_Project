 Or use your computer, if that works better. This is the first thing you need to channel a character -- a blank canvas.
 It can be the name of a person you know, a person you read about, or just something that randomly pops into your head.
 Under the name, start making a list, ask yourself questions like: Who is this person? How does he/she look like? Does this person have any siblings, if yes then who?

, Allow the character to form in your mind, see the character in your head, become the character.
 What is it like when the character wakes up in the morning? Does he/she go to work or school? How does he/she feel about his family? What does he/she like to have for lunch? All of these details add up to a life.
 When you are done with the list, read through it and hopefully you will be able to place this character in a scenario, that might spark the idea for a storyâ€¦ maybe just one detail you came up with can spark your interest in an entire story.
 Surprisingly, this game is a great way to cut yourself out of writer's block. Start with any random sentence, for example "One day there was a girl named Destiny" then you continue the story with "and then" after every sentence. "And then she met a guy named Daniel. And then she found out he was a vampire" etc. That might not be how you write a story, but, the deeper you get, you end up finding a plot.
 Create tons of info about your main character -- why is her hair so short when all of the other girls have long plaits? Her hair was like that too, but an evil man tried to cut her neck in a chase and she ducked, her hair flying up, causing him to slice it, instead.

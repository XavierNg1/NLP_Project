 If you plan on sending and receiving text messages on your unlocked cell phone, you will need to program your carrier's text message service center number into your messaging settings.


Contact your GSM carrier directly or perform an Internet search to locate the correct text message service center number for your carrier.
If ATT is your carrier, the text message service center number is +1-312-314-9810.
If T-Mobile is your carrier, the text message service center number will be +1-206-313-0004.



Refer to your manual to determine where the text message service center number can be modified from within your cell phone. In most cases, you can navigate to your messaging folder and select "Settings" or "Message Settings," then choose the "Text Messaging" settings folder to locate your messaging service center number.
 This will allow you to determine if you efficiently modified your text message settings and used the correct text messaging service center number.


Send a text message to your own phone number from your unlocked cell phone. If you successfully receive the message, your text message settings are correct; however, if your message failed to send and you received an error message, you will need to contact your GSM carrier.
Contact your GSM carrier and explain that you cannot send or receive text messages. Your carrier may be able to send you an over-the-air (OTA) update with the correct text messaging settings or walk you through steps to correct the error.

 A Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) monitoring tool delivers real-time monitoring for your entire network base. It finds active IP addresses and monitors every device on your network such as WAN links, servers, and applications.
 Using a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) monitoring tool will help you:

Find the highest traffic links
Identify protocol errors
Provide a diagnosis of specific problems
Describe your systemâ€™s configuration

, Checking system security includes network configuration, communication, encryption, remote access, and privacy policies, among others.,, Weak links are easily identified by using a speed testing software:

Search for a Local Area Network (LAN) speed testing software and download
Run the software and allow it to complete
If your link speed is 100Mbps, then expect a transfer rate of around 11Mbps to make sure your network is healthy

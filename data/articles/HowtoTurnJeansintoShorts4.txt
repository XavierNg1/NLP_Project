 Sew on beads and sequins in a pretty pattern, or use paint to decorate your shorts.









You can buy sequin and bead kits at most fabric stores if you need a little help deciding what pattern to create.
Fabric paint is also available at fabric stores. Use stencils to create a neat image.
 Do you want your shorts to look like you've had them for years? Use sandpaper a cheese grater or steel wool to "destroy" them.


Rub the tools around the pockets of the shorts and along the thighs for that "distressed" look.
Rub the tools around the bottom of the shorts to create a gradual fray effect.
 Cut slits in the front of your jeans with a pair of scissors or an Exacto-knife.









Customize your look as much as you want: Opt for a lot of slits or just do a few, and cut the slits at different angles or try to get them parallel.
Use a scissors to cut small holes in the shorts. Gently widen the holes with your fingers. The next time you run them through the wash, the holes will have a frayed, authentic look.
 You can make a bleach pattern to lighten certain areas or bleach your new shorts completely white.


Mix two parts water and one part bleach in a plastic container.
Place your pants in a dry bathtub and sprinkle the bleach solution over your pants.
Concentrate the bleach in certain areas if you wish, and experiment with different patterns depending on how you spray the bleach.
Once you're satisfied with the color, run the jeans under cold water and then wash them in the washing machine, alone, without detergent.
Use rubber bands for more of an acid-wash or ombre effect. Simply bunch up your parts of your jeans and tie them off with rubber bands. Stick the jeans in a vat or tub filled with a bleach solution of two parts water to one part bleach. Leave there for 20-60 minutes, depending on the desired color, and wash them off under running water. Then, run them through the wash, alone, without detergent.

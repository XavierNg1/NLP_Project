 After you have met Zelda at the palace and are escorted out by Impa, you're standing right in front of the drawbridge. Instead of heading over immediately to Death Mountain like Impa tells you, look straight ahead of where you are standing. There should be what looks like a group of houses on top of a hill. This is Lon Lon Ranch.;
, This is where Talon (the man you woke up at the palace to access the path) and his daughter live. Run straight in between the two buildings when you first enter and you will find yourself in a place that looks like a ranch, with a sort of circular racetrack.
 Enter the pen where the horses are running around and you will see a small girl standing in the middle, singing. Talk to her. She will thank you for waking up her father, and go on about the song she is singing. Take out your ocarina and learn “Epona’s Song.”

, Play out the next two dungeons as planned. After the dungeons are complete, go to the Temple of Time to become grown up.
 You will see that it is no longer the happy wonderful place it was when you were a kid. Now the farm has been taken over by Ingo, who has pledged allegiance to Ganondorf. You’ll see that the ranch is now used for a horse riding game. Pay Ingo the money to get in, and choose any horse and ride around. You cannot do this on the first go, so don’t try. After the time runs out, he will kick you out.
 Epona will run over to you. Get on her and ride over to the entrance where Ingo is standing. While on the horse ‘Z’ target him and press the ‘A’ button to talk. He will challenge you to a race, betting you 50 rupees. Accept the terms of the wager.


Practice riding Epona first. Move the joystick in the direction that you want to go; riding her is really as simple as that.






Press the ‘A’ button to feed Epona a carrot for a burst of speed. Epona will go faster, but you'll lose a carrot. Only use these from time to time.

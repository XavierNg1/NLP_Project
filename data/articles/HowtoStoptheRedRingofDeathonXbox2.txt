 These kits typically come packaged with an Xbox 360 opener, new thermal paste, new heat sinks, and new washers. Some will include all of the screwdrivers you will need as well. Performing this fix yourself can be difficult, but can fix most cases of RRoD.









To fix it yourself, you will need to open the 360 and remove the motherboard from the case. After removing the motherboard, you will remove the heat sinks from the CPU and GPU. They are removed by prying the clamps off the back of the motherboard.
After removing the heat sinks, you will need to scrape off the old thermal grease and apply a new layer. You may need to use acetone or nail polish remover to remove the old thermal paste. After removing the thermal paste, you will remove the squishy thermal pads.
Replace the heat sinks and the thermal pads with the new parts and reassemble the Xbox.
 There are many establishments, both online and in brick-and-mortar shops, which offer Xbox repairs. They will essentially be performing the steps outlined above. They may also reflow the solder using a heat gun. These repairs can be costly, but may be more reliable than doing it yourself. Be sure to choose with a trusted establishment.
 If you are still under warranty, Microsoft will replace or repair your failed console. You may have to pay shipping or additional fees depending on the details of your warranty. If you are out of warranty, you can pay Microsoft a fee to repair the console. The fee is less if you register online here.

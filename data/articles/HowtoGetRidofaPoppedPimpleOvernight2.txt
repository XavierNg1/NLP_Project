 Wash your hands thoroughly before you touch your face. Gently clean your face with a mild soap or facial cleanser and warm water. Use light circular motions as you wash your face. Rinse your face off with warm water and pat it down with a clean cotton towel when you're done., You can find these in most drug stores, pharmacies, or department stores. Cut a large enough piece of hydrocolloid dressing so that it can fit over the area of skin where you pimple is. Once it's the right size, you can remove the paper backing to uncover the adhesive.If the dressing is already an appropriate size for your pimple, you can skip this step.
If your dressing does not have adhesive, you can secure the edges of the dressing with medical tape.
 Press the sticky side of the dressing onto the pimple. Flatten out the dressing onto your face, making sure to smooth over any wrinkles or creases in it.Hydrocolloid dressings absorb fluids in a wound and reduce swelling.
Examples of hydrocolloid dressings include Nexcare Acne Absorbing Covers, Johnson & Johnson Tough Pads, or DuoDERM Dressing.
 Leave the hydrocolloid dressing on your face overnight. Replace the dressing in the morning when you wake up. You should see a reduction in both pus and inflammation around the area.If your skin gets irritated or a rash forms, stop using hydrocolloid dressings.
Gently pick up one corner of the dressing and peel it away to remove it.

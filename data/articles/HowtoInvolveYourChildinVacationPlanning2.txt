 Tell everyone in the family to pick one activity that they want to do. These are the activities that you will do on your vacation no matter what.Younger children may need a little more guidance in what they pick. You should give them two options. You can say, “Do you want to visit the children’s museum or the water park?”
Do not prioritize one child’s activity over the other. Everyone should be able to pick at least one activity.
 Give your child a map of your destination, and circle where some interesting activities are located. Ask them if they can plot a path for the family between the different places.To get them thinking about organization, you can ask them:


“How far it is between each place?”
“How would we get to each place? Would we walk, drive, or take a bus?”
“How long do you think it will take us to reach each place? Do you think we have time for it all?”

, Older children and teenagers may be able to handle planning software, apps, and websites. These will help your child figure out how to make an itinerary. Find a collaborative site where the entire family can post their ideas and opinions.Some good collaborative sites include:


Travefy
TripIt
Pana

, Do not try to pack too many activities into your vacation. Leave some room for flexibility. While you should let everyone pick one activity, you do not want to overwhelm the children or stress yourself out.Give yourself at least an hour or two of free time a day. Decide what to do during this time once you're there. For example, you might decide to go swimming in the hotel pool or to take a nap.
You might want to make a reservation for one nice dinner, but most meals should be spontaneous. Wait to see how the rest of the family is feeling, and give them an opinion when the time comes.

 So you’ve decided to go for it. How do you get started spying? One method is a simple glass held against the wall. The reason this works is that you create an “acoustic coupling” between the wall and the glass, allowing sound waves to travel from one side to the other.A soda or beer glass works best. Some eavesdroppers also swear by Dixie cups, but glass seems to conduct sounds better than other kinds.


Experiment with different types and shapes of glasses to see which one works best for your purposes.
If you have an iPhone, you can download the Amplitude Pro app and hold the iPhone to the glass against the wall. This app allows you to hear distant sounds much more clearly, but it also records and saves the amplified noise.;
, Some places on a wall will transmit sound more clearly than others for reasons of structure or distance from the source of the sound. Experiment to test the sound quality, until you find the best place. Sometimes this can be difficult if the sound is coming from the ceiling. If you're too far away from the sound on the wall, you won't hear things very clearly.
 Remember, in order for it to work you have to couple the wall and glass acoustically. Do this by placing the glass flat, rim down, against the wall. Now sound waves will go from the wall into the glass and make it easier for you to detect them.


Once the glass is in place, put your ear to the bottom of the glass. Continue to move the glass on the wall if you can’t hear well.

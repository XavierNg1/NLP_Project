 Reverse lunges are a variation to the standard front lunge. To perform a reverse lunge, step back with your left leg until your toes touch the floor. Lower your body until your knees are at 90 degree angles. You should end in the same position as your front lunge. Push yourself back to a standing position.


Repeat with your other leg by stepping backwards.
The reverse lunge is almost the same move, but in reverse. Because you are stepping backwards instead of forwards, this can be a more difficult more for people.
 To perform a side lunge, step your right leg to the right. Shift about 70% of your weight to your right leg, and keep the other 30% of your weight on your other leg. Bend your right knee until it is at a 90 degree angle. Your left leg should be at a diagonal and with no weight on it. Your left foot should be flat on the ground. Push yourself back to standing with your right leg.You should have a distance of around two feet or 70 cm between your legs.
Switch to the left leg when you are done.
 To complete a walking lunge, step forward into your front lunge. When you push up, do not return to the starting position. Instead, bring your left leg forward by balancing on your right leg. Place your left leg on the ground heel first, and shift your body forward into a left leg front lunge.Each time you push yourself out of the lunge, bring the back leg forward into a lunge. You should be walking across the floor as you lunge.

 In MLA style, always use the author’s last name in the in-text citation. This will help your reader to understand where your information came from.;
, In a normal in-text citation, place the information at the end of the sentence. The author’s last name and the page number you found the information on go in parenthesis:


“Ice water can be used effectively to show how evaporation works (Hess 24). Therefore, I used it in my experiment.”

, If you are using the last name at the beginning of the sentence, you don’t add the name in the parenthesis, but you still put it at the end of the sentence. For example:


“As Hess states, ‘I like ice water’ (33).”

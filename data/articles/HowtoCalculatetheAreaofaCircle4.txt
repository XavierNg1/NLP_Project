 In some problems, you may be told information about a sector of the circle and then be asked to find the area of the full circle. Read the problem carefully and look for information that will say something like, “A sector of Circle O has an area of 15π{\displaystyle \pi } cm2. Find the area of Circle O.”, A sector of a circle is a portion that is sometimes also referred to as a “wedge.” A sector is defined by drawing two radii from the center out to the edge of the circle. The space between these two radii is the sector., Use a protractor to measure the central angle made by the two radii. Set the base of the protractor along one of the radii, with the central point of the protractor aligned with the center of the circle. Then read the angle measurement that corresponds with the position of the second radius forming the sector.Make sure you know if you are measuring the small angle between the two radii or the greater angle outside them. The problem you are working on should define this for you. The sum of the small angle and the great angle will be 360 degrees. 

In some problems, instead of having you measure the central angle, the problem may just tell you the measurement. For example, you might be told, “The central angle of the sector is 45 degrees” or you may be expected to measure it.
 When you know the area of a sector and its central angle measurement, you can use the following modified formula to find the area of the circle:Acir=Asec360C{\displaystyle A_{cir}=A_{sec}{\frac {360}{C}}}


Acir{\displaystyle A_{cir}} is the area of the full circle


Asec{\displaystyle A_{sec}} is the area of the sector


C{\displaystyle C} is the central angle measure




, In this example, you have been told that the central angle is 45 degrees and that the sector has an area of 15π{\displaystyle \pi }. Insert these into this formula and solve as follows:Acir=Asec360C{\displaystyle A_{cir}=A_{sec}{\frac {360}{C}}}


Acir=15π36045{\displaystyle A_{cir}=15\pi {\frac {360}{45}}}


Acir=15π(8){\displaystyle A_{cir}=15\pi (8)}


Acir=120π{\displaystyle A_{cir}=120\pi }


, For this example, the sector was one-eighth of the full circle. Therefore, the area of the full circle is 120π{\displaystyle \pi } cm2. Since the sector’s area was given in terms of π{\displaystyle \pi }, you can assume that your area for the full circle should be reported the same way.If you want to report a numerical value, you can multiply 120 x 3.14 to get a value of 376.8 cm2.

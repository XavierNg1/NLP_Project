 Makeup can change your look for better or for worse, depending on how you use it. Here's a general routine to get you started:Pick a shade of foundation that matches your skin as closely as possible. If you're allowed to test samples, rub a dab into your throat. If it becomes invisible against your skin, even under bright light, it's a good match.

Wear eye makeup. Choose a light, fresh eyeshadow that flatters your coloring and apply a thin line of eyeliner over your upper lashes (you can also apply eyeliner on your lower lashes for an extra-dramatic look). Finish off with mascara.
Find a shade of blush that doesn't stand out too much on your skin, and use a bit on each cheek. Remember that the goal is to look naturally flushed, not like you just put on makeup.
Use bronzer sparingly. A little can go a long way. Use a light shade and dust it along your cheekbones for a naturally tanned glow.
Wear a tinted lip balm or gloss. Or, if you choose to wear lipstick, keep it looking fresh with a light coat of gloss on top of it., If you're not sure how to apply makeup or what might look good on you, schedule a consultation at a department store or beauty supply store. These consultations are often free, and a trained makeup artist can help you figure out what suits you.
 Wear deodorant and perfume, or body spray, in moderation. While you want to smell nice, you don't want to be over powering. Let your smell draw people in, not announce your presence. While most people should wear deodorant every day, refrain from overdoing it on perfumes. 1-2 small squirts along the neck should be fine.

 For every 1 quart (1 liter) of juice, add about 1 ounce (30 ml) of cream of tartar. Cream of tartar has preservative qualities. Stir the two together until thoroughly mixed.
 Letting the juice stand at room temperature lets the cream of tartar and lemon juice combine more effectively. Stir the mixture frequently during this time.
 Remove pulp and chunks of un-dissolved chunks of cream of tartar by pouring the juice through muslin or a coffee filter rested inside of a strainer. Use a mesh strainer with small holes to achieve the best results.
 Use a funnel to prevent juice from spilling out as you pour.
 Olive oil is another natural preservative. It works by cutting off the supply of air to the contents of the bottle. As a result, air is unable to reach the lemon juice in the bottle, preventing it from spoiling.
 Tightly fit a cork or other seal into the mouth of the bottle.
 Do not shake the bottle when you open it, since doing so would combine the oil and juice. Once you do open it, pour off the oil from the top of the juice before using the juice itself.

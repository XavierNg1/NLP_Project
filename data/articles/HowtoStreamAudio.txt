 If the file already exists online, you should reference the URL link for the page it resides on.;
, Different file extensions call for different web addresses, so pay attention the type of audio file it is. For example, if you want to stream an mp3, type in "http://www.yourwebsite.com/audio/clip1.mp3". (Type your actual domain name in place of "yourwebsite" and the actual audio file name in place of "clip1.")


, The full save name would be "youraudio.m3u", where "youraudio" represents the name of the directory you save your audio to. m3u is a universal audio extension that can be played by most media players online. You can create a streaming playlist by putting several web addresses in the same text file.
 Once you have done this, the audio file presented on your website should allow users to stream it.

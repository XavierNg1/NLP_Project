 Not all yoga teachers will be experienced enough to work with children with ADHD. You should look for a yoga class taught by an instructor who has a solid foundation in yoga and is also aware of how to interact with individuals with ADHD. The teacher may be certified to work with developmentally challenged children or have extensive experience teaching children with ADHD.Most yoga classes for children with ADHD will have two to three children at a time. This will allow the yoga teacher to work patiently and carefully with each child.
 You can get professional yoga instruction on a budget by looking for yoga videos online that focus on poses for individuals with ADHD. You may subscribe to a few video channels online so you can view new videos every week and integrate them into yoga sessions with the child.You may also ask parents or teachers who work with children with ADHD for recommendations on yoga video channels or sites.
 You may opt for hiring a yoga instructor for private lessons for the child so they get one on one attention. Look for a yoga instructor who is certified to teach children with ADHD and who has worked with children with ADHD before. The instructor should appear patient, confident, and open with the child in the one on one sessions.The teacher may also include brief rituals in their sessions, like lighting incense or setting up a mat, so the child gets used to focusing on specific tasks. They may then do a series of poses, taking the time to get the child to focus and relax during the session.

 Performing Istikhara is appropriate whenever you have to make a non-obligatory decision. It’s a powerful prayer of guidance for whenever you are unsure about a decision. Examples could include:Choosing a university or graduate school.
Deciding whether to take a job offer.
Choosing a spouse.
 It’s always best to recite two rak’ah before asking for guidance. It’s advised to incorporate Istikhara into your morning prayer (Salat al-Fajr) or after Salat al-Lail. Salat al-Lail is a voluntary late night prayer. It does not have a mandated number of rak’ah, but if it you perform it, it must be after the obligatory Isha, or night prayer., When you recite Salat-al-Istikhara, you should also seek advice from those you believe are wise and knowledgeable. Avoid thinking that your answers will simply come to you in dreams or visions.For example, suppose you are deciding whether to take a new job. You should consult a knowledgeable elder, like a relative or mentor. Ask them, “Will you help me understand how this new job might affect my life and my faith? Do you think this is a good decision?”

 Without your knowledge, there could be someone attempting to hack your computer to access your personal files. However, you can prevent hackers from accessing your information by installing security software to your computer. Some examples of security software include Norton and McAfee., Though you may desire to share many aspects of your personal life onto social media, don’t post overly personal information, like your address or phone number. Be very hesitant in trusting the world with that kind of information., Your passwords will allow access to your most personal information, including your email and bank account. Never share this information with anyone, especially those who you have met online.Make sure your passwords are slightly complex and are something only you would know.
 Beyond your address and passwords, you should be cautious with everything that you are posting. Pictures, statuses, and location updates all give strangers more and more information about you, information that could potentially be dangerous. Ask yourself “would I want everyone to know this?” before you post anything.Avoid posting overly revealing pictures as these can elicit responses from potential predators online.
 Remember that online, people can pretend to be anyone. Though you may have seen a picture of someone, you have no way of knowing if that is really them unless you FaceTime or Skype. Also, any information people share with you could be completely false. Remember this and proceed with caution.Should you choose to meet, meet in a public place in the middle of the day and make sure you are not followed home.
Consider meeting them with your friends as a group.
If you are younger than 18, ask your parents if you can meet someone online.

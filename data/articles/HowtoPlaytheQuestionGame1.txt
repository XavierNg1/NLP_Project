 Either one-on-one or in a group, the oracle then makes the decision of what the word or subject of the game will be. It can as vague as a word from the top of your head or as specific as a person, place, or thing.Use a dictionary as to help assist with coming up with words or subjects to center the game around.
Use the immediate environment as inspiration. Look around the room for something subtle so that the guesses that follow are more challenging to the players.;
,


The questions will all be of a deductive nature, creating clues to investigate what the subject might be.
Only twenty questions in total may be asked.
 If a player feels like they know the answer based off of others' questions, when it is their turn, they will use their turn to pose the question: "Is it a ?" The question will include their guess of what the specific object may or may not be.


Is it a thing?
Is it stationary?
Does it move on its own?
Is it blue?
Is it round?
Is it a ball?
If the player guessed correctly, the game continues with it now being their turn to lead the game as the oracle.
If the player guessed wrong, the guess counts as an additional question, and the game continues until the remaining twenty questions are asked.

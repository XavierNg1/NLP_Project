 It takes a while for ovens to reach this high temperature, so get it preheating while you are preparing the vegetables.;
, Combine the mushrooms, broccoli, spinach, pepper and onion in a large bowl. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon (15ml) of the olive oil over the vegetables and mix well to make sure everything is coated., The vegetables will roast best if you keep them in a single layer. Sprinkle the vegetables with the salt, pepper and provence seasonings., Put the baking sheet of vegetables in the oven and bake for about 10 minutes. The vegetables should just begin to soften or be tender-crisp when you take them out of the oven., While the vegetables are roasting, prepare the pasta. Put the pasta in a large pot with 6-8 cups (1.4â€“1.9 liters) of water. Follow directions on the box for how long to cook.


About 2 minutes before the pasta is supposed to be done, take out a piece and taste it. Pasta is done when it is al dente. It should not be stiff, but you should feel resistance if you bits into it. The pasta will continue to cook and soften as it cools.
 Pour the pasta into a colander to drain. Put the drained pasta into the same large bowl you used to mix the vegetables.


You can use tongs, a long fork or a slotted spoon to remove the pasta directly from the cooking water if you do not have a colander.
 Pour your tomato sauce over the pasta and sprinkle with shredded mozzarella cheese. Mix it all together and pour the mixture into a casserole dish. Sprinkle the remaining olive oil over the vegetable/cheese mixture. Then spread the parmesan cheese over the top., Place the casserole dish in the preheated oven and bake until the cheese is bubbly. After you take the casserole out of the oven, let it sit for about 10 minutes to cool slightly. This will make it easier to serve.

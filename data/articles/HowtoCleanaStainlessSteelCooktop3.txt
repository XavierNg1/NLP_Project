 If your cooktop is hot while you’re cleaning it, you run the risk of burning yourself during the cleaning process. Additionally, you might cause the cleaning agent you’re using to vaporize, causing irritation to the eyes or skin.Don’t assume your stainless steel cooktop is cool just because it is off. Hold your hand just barely above the cooktop to detect heat.
Alternately, wet your hand and flick a few drops of water at the stainless steel cooktop. If the water sizzles, the cooktop is too hot to clean.
 Chemical cleaners or formulae containing chlorides (bromine, iodine, chlorine, fluorine, and so on) can damage your stainless steel cooktop. Likewise, cleaning agents containing alcohol, mineral spirits, and ammonia can cause your stainless steel cooktop to corrode. To avoid using these products, carefully read the label on the exterior of any cleaning product before utilizing it.If you’re unsure whether a stainless steel cleaning agent might damage your stainless steel cooktop, apply it to a small, relatively hidden portion of the cooktop (the back or sides, for example) and wait a day or two. Examine the stainless steel cooktop. If the area appears damaged or corroded, do not apply the cleaning agent to the rest of the cooktop.Avoid cleaning compounds that contain grit.
 Do not use steel wool or steel brushes. Both steel wool and steel brushes can scratch your stainless steel cooktop. Instead, use a microfiber cleaning cloth. These cloths are specially designed to wipe away even the most firmly embedded grime or stains.

 Start smiling a lot and laugh. Talk to people and try to avoid arguments, bad language or people that make you upset. Hang around with your friends and be the cheery one in your group. If your personality is already quite quirky and happy, you don't need to worry about this step.;
,, You might not be that into colours and you just want to add a tad of colour into your fashion style. You might want to go all out in your colours and absolutely explode with colours. You might want to be a bit in between. Anything is fine. Here's a few ideas:


Just a little bit of colour added: find colourful scarves, bangles, necklaces, hats, shoes, handbags, glasses, belts, makeup and nail polish.






In the middle: A colourful T-shirt, hats and shoes are still an open option. Tone it down with some jeans or wear a black or grey long-sleeved shirt underneath your shirt.






Going all out: Is exactly what it comes down to. Colourful shirts, pants, belts, shoes, hats, gloves, glasses, make-up, long socks or jackets. Go crazy!!







, Maybe cut tear marks into your T-shirt and wear it over another shirt. Knit yourself a bright scarf. Dye your jeans. Wear bright nail polish or eye make-up. Add badges and jewelry to your outfits. Anything you can think of editing slightly, try it out! Have fun with it!

, If you're shying away wearing all those bright colours and bazaar accessories, it won't look quite right. Try adding a spring into your step, wipe a smile across your face and laugh out loud.

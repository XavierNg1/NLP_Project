 Cyclic hydrocarbons work like non-cyclic hydrocarbons as far as naming - those containing no multiple bonds are cycloalkanes, those with double bonds are cycloalkenes, and those with triple bonds are cycloalkynes. For instance, a 6-carbon ring with no multiple bonding is cyclohexane.
 There are a few notable differences between naming cyclic and non-cyclic hydrocarbons:


Because all the carbons in a cyclic hydrocarbon ring are equal, you don't need to use a number if your cyclic hydrocarbon only has one constituent.
If the alkyl group attached to the cyclic hydrocarbon is larger or more complex than the ring, then the cyclic hydrocarbon may become a substituent instead of the parent chain.
If two substituents are on the ring, they're numbered in alphabetical order. The first (alphabetically) substituent is 1; the next is numbered going counterclockwise or clockwise - whichever results in a lower number for the second substituent.
If more than two substituents are on the ring, the first one alphabetically is said to be attached to the first carbon. The others are numbered counterclockwise or clockwise - whichever results in the lowest numbers.
Like non-cyclic hydrocarbons, the final molecule is named in alphabetical order, excluding prefixes like di-, tri- and tetra-.

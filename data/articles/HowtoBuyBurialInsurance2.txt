 If you already have life insurance, part of the proceeds can be directed for use in covering your burial expenses or you can buy a separate policy that only covers these expenses.


Life insurance with a family member as beneficiary provides funds to the person who will plan the funeral and burial according to your wishes. You will need to discuss your wishes with that family member.
Life insurance with a funeral director as a beneficiary allows the funeral director to use the policy's proceeds for your funeral and burial. You will make arrangements with the funeral director to provide the services you want.



A policy purchased with a lump sum payment will provide the full value of the policy immediately--your beneficiary will have all the funds needed to provide the funeral and burial you want even if you die the day after paying for the policy. You may only be offered a policy with a lump sum payment if you're older.
A graded benefit policy will provide a certain amount of the face value depending on how many payments you have made. For example, if you choose a policy that will be paid for in 5 years, your beneficiary will only receive all the funds after 5 years; if you die before then, your beneficiary will only receive part of the funds and will have to pay the difference or choose cheaper options.
A traditional policy will provide full coverage immediately as long as you make the payments, but will be canceled if you stop paying.

 A drop veil is created out of a single piece of fabric. The fabric is not gathered. The total length of your full combines the first measurement (measurement of the longer veil) with the second measurement (measurement of the blusher). Add together the two measurements and cut your veil to the appropriate length., Lay the material on a flat, clean surface and smooth out any wrinkles. Fold the material in half lengthwise. Fold the material in half widthwise., Find the corner of the folded material where all four layers are separate. Round off the corners with a pair of fabric scissors. You may eyeball the curve or measure the curve. After cutting, carefully trim off the rough edges., Unfold lay the material out flat. Fold the top edge of the veil down so that it lays on top of the bottom layer of material. Adjust the length of the top layer until it matches the length of the blusher measurement., Fold the material in half lengthwise. Mark the center fold of the veil with a pin. Unfold the veil., Use the pin to help you center the hair comb, curved side up, along the top edge of your veil. Once you are pleased with your placement, remove the pin. Use a threaded needle to secure the comb to your veil.

 The first thing the doctor will do is to make sure you're pregnant. The doctor will also take down your medical history, including information about your period, and run both urine and blood tests to make sure you're healthy.They will also want to know what medications you're on, in case any of them shouldn't be taken while you're pregnant., They will also want to conduct a physical exam, including doing a Pap smear to check for any disease-related problems. They'll also do things like check your blood pressure and weigh you.To determine how many weeks pregnant you are, the doctor will check the size of your uterus, usually by pressing on your abdomen. From that information, they will have a general idea how far along you are., Another way to check how many weeks pregnant you are is to have an ultrasound. However, you usually don't have an ultrasound until you're about 10 to 13 weeks pregnant (plus 6 days). When you have an ultrasound, the sonographer will measure your baby, giving you a better estimation of how far along you are.

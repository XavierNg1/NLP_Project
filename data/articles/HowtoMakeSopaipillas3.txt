 Find frozen or refrigerated puff pastry and your choice of toppings. The puff pastry will need to be baked, not fried, so you donâ€™t need any oil for them.
 Follow the package instructions for baking temperature and times, and set your oven to heat up while you do the prep work.
 Allow time for the pastry to thaw if it is frozen, and then slice into triangles no larger than three inches across.
 This step is optional, but you could fold the pastry pieces over to hide a morsel of chocolate or caramel inside.
 Follow the directions on the pastry package and cook for the allotted amount of time, until the pastry has risen and is a golden brown.
 Let them sit for ten minutes to cool, and then add your toppings of choice.

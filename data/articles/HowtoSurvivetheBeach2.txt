 Sand is one of the most fun things to play with. You could make sandcastles, dig a tunnel or even just make a hole. Don't bother if the beach is shingle or pebble.


You could bring a few water bottles to wash the sand off when you're done playing in the sand. Stand on a towel or body board to keep your feet clean while you do it. Many beaches have taps to rinse feet, bags, paws or anything else Sandy off. Use these if they are available.
 It's great fun to ride the waves back to the beach.


Be sure to get the ones with straps so your child can wrap it around his/her wrist or ankle.
 Many people take beach balls, volley balls, or even just soccer balls to play with at the beach. It's a great way for the whole family to get involved and have fun.
 A few magazines or paperback books can pass the time pleasantly born the beach. Heavy, hard back books are less easy to handle on the beach and might be damaged by water or sand.

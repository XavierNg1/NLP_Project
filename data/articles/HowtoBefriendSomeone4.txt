 Unless you work by yourself, there are usually a lot of opportunities to create lasting relationships in any work place with a wide variety of types of people.You may like or feel comfortable with a particular person at work. In normal everyday interactions there may be a few people who you know you “click” with. Those are your potential friends.
While you probably won't connect with everyone you work with, it's important to make a good friend at the place where you spend most of your waking hours.
 In order for you to befriend someone at work you will need to show them that you are nice to be around. While work can be stressful at times, be sure to keep an air of approachability and pleasantness even when having difficult conversations.
 Even though you may not enjoy every conversation, you will figure out who you enjoy hanging out with and who you do not.
 Try to familiarize yourself with what interests and hobbies the other person might have. You may be surprised to find that you might end up sharing interests or hobbies with someone you work with.
 Friendship is not something that can be built in a day, it takes time and commitment at both ends, just like any other relationship. If you want to be friends with a coworker you will need to spend time with them outside of your workplace. Build your friendship off of common interests and fun activities, not just proximity during work hours.

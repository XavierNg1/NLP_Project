 You can implement SOLE beyond your home too, such as when you travel as a family, when you are out and about and when you are stuck in a traffic or a long queue. There are always opportunities to use SOLE, provided you can access the internet.


Use outings to promote SOLE learning at home. For example, if you and your family visit a museum, art gallery or similar place, or you go and see a movie or watch a sports match, you can use these as a basis for asking questions about things observed or not understood related to the event.
 SOLE is great for ages 8-12. During these years, your children's thinking abilities will change quite a lot, and you'll find that giving questions in greater complexity as your child grows older will help challenge them more.


You could also continue the SOLE activities for older children but this will likely depend on the level of schoolwork and other activities that they're engaged in. Hopefully by this stage, having used the SOLE process will set older children in good stead for deeper self-directed learning in their curriculum studies, as they will draw on the skills learned from your home-initiated SOLE activities.

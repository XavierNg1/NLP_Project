 If you choose to have your event outdoors, prefer a location that is near an indoor back-up location. For example, you could decide to have a garden party that is near a clubhouse, garden conservatory, or a cafe.
 It will be important to have the rights to move everyone indoors if the weather turns sour. This might necessitate paying extra and keeping those responsible for the indoor venue updated about your intentions, especially from the early hours of the actual day of the event., Purchase a marquee or erect a temporary structure to house people should the rain pour down or the icy winds gust. This can be left shut if the weather remains glorious, or used as a coat and gift area to save guests having to hold everything they came with. If the weather changes during the event, be sure to have helpers who can shift everything quickly into the temporary shelter so that the event can continue. You will need to arrange for helpers to move things in at one end to allow guests to mill around out of the weather's way at the other end., The easiest option and possibly the most cost-effective as you will use both venues, is to plan to have an indoor event that encourages outdoor flow. This makes the best of both opportunities and also allows people who feel more comfortable indoors to remain inside when others go out.

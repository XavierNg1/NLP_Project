 Pick a leather Oxford or other quality leather dress shoe in the same tone or darker than your suit. Care for your dress shoes by regularly cleaning and polishing.Socks should either match the color of the shoe or be a shade darker than the suit so they don’t stand out when legs are crossed.
 Pair a quality leather belt with matching color shoes and buckle that is not too showy. Ideally, the buckle’s metal will match the metal features of your watch or ring.


Buy a reversible belt with brown and black sides to easily pair with either shoe color.
 Wear cufflinks to fasten your shirt sleeves closed and to provide a little extra ornament to your outfit. Choose ones that will complement your suit or match the color of your tie., Invest in a classic leather band watch if you wish, preferably that matches the color of your belt and shoes.


You can also add a ring to your ensemble, but any jewelry beyond that is usually too much., Choose a brown or black shade of leather to match the color of shoe and belt you most often wear, and polish like you would shoes.

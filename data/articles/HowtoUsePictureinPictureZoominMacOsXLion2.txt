 If you would rather have a stationary zoom window (instead of one which moves with the cursor), press the button next to "Stationary."Alternatively, you can choose "Tiled along Edge." This will display the zoomed area along the left edge of your screen.
 If you choose the "Stationary" option, you can control where on your desktop the zoom window appears, as well as how much space it takes up. Click the "Adjust Size and Location" button, then drag the box that appears to your chosen place. You can change the size of the box by dragging the corners. Click the "OK" button when you are done.
 Click the "Crosshair" button if you would rather see a crosshair style cursor in the zoom window (instead of a normal mouse pointer).
 If you can read better with a black background, tick the "Invert Colors" box. This will invert all of the colors in the zoom box.

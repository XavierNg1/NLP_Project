 While there is no scientific evidence that they make a face thinner, they could still help you tone your face. Here are some exercises to try:









Make a fish face by sucking in your cheeks and pursing your lips. Hold this for a few seconds.
Tilt your head back so your chin points toward the ceiling. Drop your lower jaw and then raise it up. Hold this position for a few seconds while you stretch your neck.
Shift your gaze to the left for a few seconds, then to the right.
Shut your eyes tightly and scrunch up your face for a few seconds, then open it as wide as you are able to.
 If your face is round due to weight gain and not bone structure, try to cut back on overly sweet or fatty foods, such as fried foods, sodas, candy, and fries. Instead, try to eat more vegetables, fruits, grains, and lean meats.
 Drinking too much alcohol can make your face look more bloated and less thin the next day.
 If your face is round because you have gained weight, you can make it slimmer by getting into shape. Try going swimming, jogging, running, or walking a few times a week. Working out for just thirty minutes a day can have a dramatic impact on the way your body looks.
 The most expensive and permanent of face slimming techniques, face-lifts and plastic surgery are not without risks and may result in scarring and bloating.An untrained technician may also give you less-than-pleasing results. If this is something that you are considering, speak with an experienced plastic surgeon to review your medical history and see if this is an option for you.

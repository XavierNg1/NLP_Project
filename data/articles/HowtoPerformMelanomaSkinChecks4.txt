, Everyone should check their skin for melanomas. It is a good idea to keep an eye on any moles to see if they change shape, color, size, or texture. Even if you are not at risk for melanoma, check your skin once every three to twelve months using the melanoma skin check process.If you are a low risk candidate, decide if you want to check yourself every three, six, or 12 months. If you have had more exposure to the sun and UV rays, or you have a lot of moles, you may want to check yourself more often than if you don't.If you are unsure about how often you should check yourself, contact your doctor.
Almost every skin cancer caught early can be treated and cured. The chances of cure decrease with later detection.
 Melanomas often occur on the chest and the back in men. In women, they usually occur on the legs. Melanomas can often be found on the face and neck in both sexes.


Much less commonly, melanomas can develop on the eyes, the mouth, the genitals, and around the anus.

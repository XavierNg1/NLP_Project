 Similar to a mutual fund, these funds offer exposure to a wide array of companies for average investors who may not be able to afford a large investment.
 One example is United States Natural Gas Fund, which trades more than eight-million shares every day. It is the most popular natural gas fund on the market.
 You might find some funds are buying high and selling low, which can adversely impact the amount of money you're earning.

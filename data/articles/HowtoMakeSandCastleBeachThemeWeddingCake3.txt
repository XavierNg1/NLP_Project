 Once the mixture has melted cool for about five minutes and place on the mixer stand. Add a little Crisco to the paddle attachments.
 Take them out and very carefully stir with a wooden spoon, they are very hot and thin and accidents happen easily at this point. Add a little Crisco. If using corn syrup add now and stir with the wooden spoon or the mixer.
 When half the sugar has been incorporated knead by hand for about seven minutes, or use a bread hook on the mixer. Whilst you are kneading dip your hands in a light coating of Crisco and knead it in. Use sparingly to start with, as the finished product will be sticky if you have added too much. Add a little more sugar once the last cup has been incorporated. If it is too hot to do by hand then use a wooden spoon. This mixture will become very stiff and resistant to handling as you add more sugar. Re-grease your hands and rework the MMF until it is smooth and elastic and pliable.
 If you are doing it with the dough hook then keep it on low and knead for about four minutes.

 Melt two ounces of olive, sunflower, or sweet almond oil, two ounces of coconut oil, one ounce of shea butter, and four teaspoons of beeswax together over low heat. Stir constantly until all the ingredients are melted and blended together. This will take five minutes or less., You can also carefully pour the mixture into twenty standard lip balm tubes. Be careful you do not burn yourself as you pour the dog balm into the storage containers!

To protect yourself, try wearing gloves during this step as the mixture will be hot.
 Once you have poured the dog balm into the storage containers, itâ€™s important you let the balm cool completely. It should be hard when it is cool enough. After it is cool, place the caps or lids on the storage containers.

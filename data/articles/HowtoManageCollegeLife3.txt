 The faculty at your university or college are there to help you. If you are struggling in a class or need help managing your work load, don’t hesitate to email your professors or visit them during office hours. They may be able to offer you advice or help you figure out a schedule that works better for you.
 If you’re feeling really stressed out, it can help to talk to someone sympathetic. Talk to a supportive family member or friend. If they are in college or have been to college in the past, they may have advice to offer. Even if they don’t have specific advice, just talking about how you’re feeling can be helpful. Keeping in touch with people at home can also be helpful for dealing with feelings of homesickness and loneliness.

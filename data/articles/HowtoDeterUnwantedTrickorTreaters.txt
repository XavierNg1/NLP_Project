 Porch lights are the unofficial "signal" to trick or treaters that you have candy or not. Parents whom walk with their kids would acknowledge homes that aren't lit in front, while older kids might not get the hint if they see house lights on through the windows. You can also bring in any Halloween decorations around your yard to avoid any additional misunderstandings.;
, If you have a baby whom you are trying to get down to sleep or an alert dog, you might want to put the signs closer to the sidewalk rather than the porch. Make sure that they are well lit and big enough to read clearly, so that eager children don't miss it.
 Be sure to leave a large note with light stating specifically that it is the candy bowl for the entire night and trick or treaters should take one piece of candy per person. This option has a pro and con to it, as you won't feel obligated to get up from your couch every time the doorbell rings, but the candy might be all grabbed up by an unknown amount of kids in a short amount of time.
 Make sure that every light is off and windows/doors locked. Majority of the kids accompanied by their parents usually start in the mid-afternoon, while there's still daylight outside. Teens whom circle around neighborhoods typically end around 9 to 10 pm.
 Halloween candy is not a requirement to purchase and you have every right to turn anyone away if you aren't giving things out.

 Using tobacco can damage your heart and blood vessels and is a major risk factor for heart disease like stroke and heart attack.It also has a negative impact on your lungs and how well you can breathe during exercise. Quit smoking to greatly improve your cardiovascular and overall health.


Talk to your doctor if you need help to quit smoking. There are gums, patches, and medications that can make it easier.
Your risk of heart disease starts to decrease as soon as you quit smoking.
 Ideally, do not drink alcohol at all. Alcohol consumption can raise triglycerides in the blood, cause high blood pressure, heart failure, increase risk of stroke, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmia, sudden cardiac death, and increase calorie intake (which can lead to obesity and higher risk of diabetes).If you do drink, do not drink excessively. Drinking “in moderation” involves having no more than one serving daily for women, and two servings daily for men., Good sleep is good for your cardiovascular health. Research shows that most adults need seven to nine hours of sleep per night. Try sleeping in a quiet, dark room with a cool temperature. If necessary, you can use a sleep mask or earplugs.A white noise machine (or app) or a fan is useful for a lot of people.
Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day and night--even on weekends.
Avoid technology for at least an hour before bedtime. Try reading a book instead of checking Instagram.
 Stress releases a hormone called cortisol in your body, which can cause weight gain, poor sleep, and damage to your circulatory system.Do relaxation techniques to help you to feel calmer and reduce those stress hormones. Try meditation, deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, journaling, listening to music — whatever helps you relax.

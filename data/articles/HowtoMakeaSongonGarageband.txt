 Select the Songwriting project under the New Project tab.;
,, You should now be on a blank GarageBand project similar to this:

, This will allow you choose instruments and certain loops to mix and match and create a song.
 Click the All Drums button and scroll through the available kits. You can also specify your search and click the buttons highlighted to find a certain type of drums. To hear the drums just click on them. Once you find your drum set, drag it out to the center of the screen and it will automatically set itself on the timeline.


You can copy a drum set (or any music/instrument) and paste it to create longer songs more quickly.
 Now lets add some guitar. Click the reset button (double arrows pointing backwards) and then select the guitars tab. Again, you can narrow your search down to the exact type of guitar. Once you have a guitar selected, drag it out to the timeline underneath or above your drumâ€™s line.


Use a combination of instruments playing with each other and/or solo by spacing them appropriately on the timeline.
 Drag it and adjust it to fit your song.


At any time you can hit the play button (or space bar) to hear what your mix sounds like.

 Check with the administration at your institution to see if there is a specific template to be used for a scheme of work. Ideally, look at a scheme of work left by your predecessor. If one isn't available, ask a few colleagues if you can see their schemes of work and look for predominant commonalities between them to gauge what is expected at the institution., Schemes of work are available on teaching resource websites for purchase and download. Search for one to save yourself time in the lesson planning process, or to have a template to modify. Be sure that any school or department-specific requirements are acknowledged and listed on the document you end up with.For instance, schemes of work are available on Click Teaching, a teaching resource website that teachers can subscribe to for approximately $50 a year., Use a Word document (and make a table on it) or create an Excel spreadsheet to write your schedule of work. Start by adding the basic information and add to the document as you wish (e.g. adding a column called “Initials” or “Signature” at the end of the chart to sign and show that a learning goal was completed on schedule . Create several main columns in the chart, labelled:


“Date” or “Lesson number”, to delineate each interval
“Topic” (i.e. the overall subject matter of a specific unit)
“Lesson content”: a brief overview of the lesson planned, which can be broken down into sub-topics
“Specific objectives”
“Learning Activities”
“Resources”
“Assessment”
“Remarks”

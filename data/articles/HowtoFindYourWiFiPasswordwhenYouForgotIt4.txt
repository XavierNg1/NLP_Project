 This button is usually on the back of the router. You'll probably need a paperclip or needle to press the "Reset" button.


Resetting your router will also disconnect every device you have connected to the router. For this reason, resetting the router should be your last resort.
 Do so for at least 30 seconds to ensure that the router completely resets.


The lights on the router should flash or briefly turn off when the router has officially reset.
 This information is usually found on the bottom of the router, and includes the following:


Network name or SSID - Your network's factory name that you'll see in the Wi-Fi menu.

Password or Key - Your network's stock password.
 When entering the password, you'll use the factory password that's printed on the bottom of your router.


You may have the option of changing the password before you connect to the Internet.

 A promissory note is just another term for a loan agreement. Under either title, this is a contract that identifies the loan given to the borrower and specifies the terms of repayment., A mortgage is a legal term used to describe an agreement between the parties that certain real estate will be given as collateral to secure a loan. The simplest mortgage just needs to identify the parties, describe the loan, and identify the property. Depending on the amount of the loan and the identities of the parties, some mortgage documents can become quite complicated.Some online resources exist to help you create your own mortgage agreement. One such resource is Rocket Lawyer, which provides templates that are valid for most U.S. states. You simply identify your state, provide the details of your loan, and the program creates a mortgage document for you.
You should have the mortgage witnessed and notarized. In some states, this is a requirement, such that failure to do so will nullify the mortgage. In others, it may not be required but is still a good practice.
 To finalize the secured loan with the real estate collateral, you must file the completed mortgage and loan agreement with a state office where the property is located. The requirements for filing differ from state to state. You should check with a local attorney or the secretary of stateâ€™s office for the state where the property exists to determine the appropriate filing method.For example, in Massachusetts, the loan documents are filed with the Registry of Deeds in the county where the property is located.
In Connecticut, mortgages are recorded with the town clerk where the property exists.
In New York, you must file the mortgage with the county clerk for the county where the property exists.

 What kind of artwork will you be putting on your skin? Size and detail are usually the first considerations of your placement. Is this a small, or a large tattoo? Does it have a lot of fine details such as swirls or shading that won't be visible if the art has to be scaled down?;
, The back is a favored canvas because of its broad, gentle curves. To a lesser extent, the thigh, the stomach, upper arms, or the back of the calf are also good choices for very large designs.
 A small tattoo may lose impact if you choose a broad, empty area of skin, but an unexpected word or doodle offers an almost "treasure hunt" appeal to your body. You may try behind the ear, around a finger, or behind the joint of your ankle. Some artists have even started offering tattoos on the forward helix (this is the curved outside rim of your ear, from the very top down and forward to your tragus, which is the little tab of cartilage over the ear canal), the inside of the lip, and even on the tongue!

, For the obvious reasons, it behooves you to choose an area that will allow the artist to complete the design evenly, such as the upper forearm, around the bicep, or just above the ankle (rather than directly on the boney, tender ankle itself).

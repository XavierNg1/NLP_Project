Look casual and calm.
If you make it, say "Yes!" and look happy, but don't gloat.
If you don't make it, say, "That's all right."
Each director has their own rules about casting.  Some will cast everyone who comes to callbacks and then some.  Some will cast only a few who go to callbacks.  Keep your hopes up!

Do everything listed in Step 1 of Part 1 to prepare yourself.
Evaluate your performance at the audition.  Decide what you could have done better and what you did well.  Jot down your thoughts.
Using your notes, practice improving sketch areas (this step is important whether or not you make it in to callbacks because you will be auditioning for other plays).



Wait patiently for your turn.  Do not talk to your neighbors during other people's auditions, but appear friendly and smile.
Be polite.  Ask questions where needed.
Sing your best!  If you don't know the song very well, look at the music but raise your head slightly.  Smile!  If you know the music well, look right into the directors eyes and be as happy as possible!
Dance your best.  Do everything listed in Step 3 of Part 2.
Do cold readings as well as you possibly can!  Read your lines with expression.  Look at the directors and other actors participating with you.  Look at what you should say ahead of time.

 If you kiss someone with a fresh piercing, you are introducing foreign bacteria into their body that could result in an infection. Wait until the piercing heals before even considering it.


Tongue piercings take 4 to 6 weeks to heal fully but vary from person to person.A lip piercing typically takes anywhere from 6 to 10 weeks to fully heal.Labret and Monroe piercings take 2 to 6 months to heal fully., Use an antiseptic mouthwash like Listerine, Orajel, or Biotene if you can't help but kiss someone. However, it's also important to note that you should stay away from overuse of mouthwash because it could result in an oral yeast infection.If your tongue or mouth begins to turn white, keep mouthwash usage to a minimum.You can ask your partner also to use an antiseptic mouthwash before kissing you to reduce the chance of infection.
 If your piercing becomes dislodged or tears because of rough kissing, then visit a doctor to avoid infection. Often the piercing will have to be removed and then re-pierced once it's fully healed. Effectively caring for a torn piercing will reduce the chances of more severe infections or complications in the future.

Water. How much will you need? Is it a full one - day hike, or just an hour long hike? Pack several small bottles of water, and a box of water purification tablets, just in case. For example, if you get lost in the woods, the water purification tablets will make any river water safe to drink. Spread the water around the bag, but put the tablets near the top.
Matches. Get a small box of waterproof matches, swathe them in plastic bag or cling film, and keep in a side pocket.
Food. How much food will you need? Pack plenty of energy bars, possibly a few tins of food (if you are planning on lighting a fire, or taking a gas cooker, you can take tins of potatoes, carrots etc), a few sandwiches, possibly some crisps or other starch based snacks, some fruit in an airtight container and any other food you want. Keep the food near the top, but make sure it isn't squashed.
Clothing. Pack a warm jumper, a waterproof coat and possible a scarf, hat and gloves. Keep these near the middle.
Torch. Pack a torch that has brand new batteries in it, and some spare batteries.
Lavatory paper. If you are caught in the woods and need to excrete your bowels, you will need it. Keep it in a separate pocket, wrapped in a plastic bag to keep it dry.
Money. Pack a little money, just in case you need to use a pay - phone.
Cell/Mobile Phone. Charge it up, and pack it just in case. Keep this in a clean, dry pocket.

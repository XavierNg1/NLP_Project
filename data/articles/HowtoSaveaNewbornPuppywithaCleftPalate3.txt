 Not all vets perform cleft palate surgery. If yours does not, find a local animal hospital that not only performs these surgeries but has a high success rate. Some dogs might require multiple surgeries, but with an experienced surgeon, this chance decreases.Ask your vet for a referral. They will probably know of an animal hospital that can help.
Cleft palate surgeries are very difficult on young animals, and your vet will probably want to wait until they are three to four months old. Some surgeries may not take place until the puppy is eight or nine months old.
 Some cleft palates may close on their own. If your vet advises you to wait until the puppy is older, you should check the palate frequently to see how it is healing. If you think that the palate is growing wider, you should call the vet to consider your options., Your puppy will likely be required to wear an Elizabethan collar for one or two weeks after the surgery. This is to protect their mouths. In addition, you should avoid giving them toys, hard foods, treats, or other objects that they will put into their mouth.If you notice the puppy playing with their sutures or chewing on something they shouldnâ€™t, try to distract them. Call their name, clap your hands, or pick them up and remove them from that spot. This can help prevent a second surgery.
 To protect their sutures, you will not be able to feed them hard kibble, treats, or other foods for at least two weeks. Do not feed them any food that they have to chew. Your vet will have specific instructions for their post-surgery diet.If they have a soft palate cleft, you can feed them canned food for two weeks.
If they have a hard palate cleft, you will need to blend their food. You will need to feed them by hand or by feeding tube.

 If you have a printer that does not connect to the wireless network, you can use your computer to turn it into an AirPrint server. The printer will need top be connected directly to your computer via USB, or connected to the router via Ethernet if the printer supports it.
 If you don't have iTunes on your computer, download the Bonjour Print Service from Apple at support.apple.com/kb/DL999. This will install the necessary drivers for AirPrint.


iTunes comes with this service installed, so if you use iTunes you can skip this step.
 Your printer will need to have sharing enabled in order for the AirPrint service to work:


Open the Start menu or screen and type "devices and printers."
Right-click your printer in the Devices and Printers window and select "Printer Properties."
Click the "Sharing" tab and check "Share this printer."
Click "OK" to save your changes.
 These are programs that mimic the AirPrint service, allowing you to turn printers connected to your computer into AirPrint printers. One of the most popular free options is Elpamsoft AirPrint Installer, though it's not the most user-friendly program.


The original developer's site is gone, but you can find Elpamsoft AirPrint Installer on a variety of different download sites.
 Elpamsoft AirPrint Installer will likely download as a ZIP file. Double-click this file to open it, then click "Extract" at the top of the window. This will extract the files into a new folder with the same name as the ZIP file.
 If you aren't logged in with an administrator account, you'll be prompted for the admin password.
 This will install the new AirPrint service on your computer.
 This will automatically start the service when Windows start.
 This will start the new AirPrint service.
 Now that the service is up and running, you should be able to select your printer by tapping the Share button and selecting "Print." If the printer has a padlock next to it, you'll be prompted to enter your Windows user password.Your printer will need to be turned on and you'll need to be logged into Windows in order for the printer to appear on your iPhone.

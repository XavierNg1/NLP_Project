 Go for a short run, jog in place, or do fifty jumping-jacks.;
, Get into a pike, (both legs straight out in front of you,) and flex your feet. Lean over and pick a comfortable spot to sit at. Breathe in, and while you let your breath out, push yourself until you feel a little pain. Pain=good. Too much pain=injury. No pain=no stretching. Hold this for an 8 count, and then come up.
 Hold your hands above your head, ballerina style, and lean to the left. Count to ten, then come back up. Repeat this, but on your right side now. Once you are done, stretch your feet out as far as possible into the middle splits, (little pain,) and lean down into the middle. Aim for your elbows or chest to reach the floor; not your head. Hold this for as long as you want. The longer you hold it, the better and deeper you will get into your splits.
 Stretch one foot out in front of you, and fold the other one. Pull the other one up towards your chest. Hold for ten seconds, and then relax. Repeat on other foot. After you do this stretch, go back down in the pike. You will see that you have gone down a little more.
 Now, let's get into the splits!

, Step out with one foot as far as you can without pain. This doesn't have to be very far. Now, put the top of your back foot on the ground and get into a lunge. Stretch and feel it in your groin and back of the leg. Repeat on other foot.
 Now, try to touch your toes. Repeat on each leg.
 Put your hands down on the ground to support you. Now, lift your body off of the floor and lower yourself to the ground. Go into your splits. You don't need to go all the way down, but hold this for ten seconds, then relax. Now switch feet.
 Repeat each of these several times a week, and soon you will have your splits! Good luck, girls!

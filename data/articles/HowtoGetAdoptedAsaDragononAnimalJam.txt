 You can be a dragon, or even an egg.


Note that players don't always like to adopt Western dragons.;
, Also find some wings (these should probably should match color of body) and maybe a tail.
 This is the most likely place to get adopted. The forest might also work. Call out your type of dragon.
 At all times, be nice; potty mouthed dragons don't get adopted. For example:


Say something like "is a fierce dragon and will protect your home".
If you're a baby, say "is cute little baby dragon that needs a home".
 Stay in character and say something like "roars nicely" or " likes mommy" because then the mother will like you even more.
 If there is a plushie you might say "wrestles playfully with plushie".
 Some of the things you could say include:


When you are tired say "yawns and begins to stretch and lays down".
When you are hungry say "chews on (say whatever here) and gabbles".
When you are mad say "kicks and screams and throws (say whatever here)".
When you are lonely or sad, then cry.
 Whenever your mom takes you somewhere with other babies or you have a sister or brother, then act nice! Don't be mean or the mother will give you up.

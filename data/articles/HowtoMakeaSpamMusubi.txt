 Rinsing or washing the rice is traditional in preparing Japanese rice, however, you are also washing away nutrients.






;
, A 3 US-quart (3,000Â ml) rice cooker will be enough for 10 to 12 spam musubi, depending on how much rice is going to be divided amongst each one.









Put half an inch of rice on both sides of the spam.
 Lay them shiny side down (so that the rough side is to you). Set these aside for now.
 Open can, remove spam. Cut the spam horizontally into slices.









Use a sharp knife.
 Try frying, baking, or boiling the spam. Spam is pre-cooked, so you don't need to cook it long.









Microwave: Cook approximately 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.
Frying/baking: Cook until it turns brown or crispy.
Boiling: Boil the spam in 1/2 part soy sauce, 1 part water and sugar or sweetener for approximately 5 minutes.
 Mix equal parts of soy sauce and brown sugar in a small bowl and allow the cooked spam to soak for a little while.
 Moisten the musubi mold and place it in the middle of the seaweed. Don't wet it too much, or else the seaweed will be too "gooey."








, Add 1/4 inch (0.64 cm) to 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) of rice, depending size of the mold. Flatten the rice.









Sprinkle furikake on the rice. (Optional).










If you want the spam on top of the musubi, fill the mold with more rice and flatten it hard. Sprinkle with furikake, place the spam slice on it, and wrap with seaweed.
 Moisten the back of a spoon or the top of a musubi mold to flatten everything down.
 Holding down the top flat piece, slowly slide the mold up around the top piece and off of the musubi. Take the flat piece off afterwards, being careful of the stickiness of the rice.
 This action is very similar as tucking a baby in a blanket. Dab some water on the edge to seal it.
 Note that the rice has to be hot. If you are using refrigerated rice or standing rice, microwave it for a couple of minutes before making.

 When cutting the strip, the measurements do not need to be accurate, these are just suggested. Try to keep the width even so that you have a long thin rectangle.To simplify the process, you can simply cut down the edge of a plain sheet of paper to make your strip.;
,


The size you make the letters doesnâ€™t matter, but the position of each one is important for the twist step.
 Hold the two ends in your hands, give the A-C side of the strip a half twist and join it to the B-D side. Match the letters, A to D and B to C and tape the edges together. Once the edges are taped, you have completed the Mobius strip.You can twist the paper more than one time and still have a Mobius strip., Using a pen or pencil, start at any point in the middle of the strip and draw a line all the way around without lifting your pen. Eventually, the pen will end up back at the point you started drawing. You have drawn a line on both sides of the loop - but without lifting your pen or crossing any edge. How did this happen? The paper has only one side!Start at a different point in the Mobius strip and see if the same thing happens.
 Take a highlighter and start coloring the edge of the Mobius strip without lifting the highlighter from the strip. Continue with the marker until you reach the point at which you started. You'll find both edges are colored. This indicates that the Mobius strip has only one edge!

, With a pair of scissors, poke a hole into the middle of the Mobius strip and cut along the line until you reach the beginning cut. It does not, as you'd expect, fall apart into two separate loops; instead you now have a single, larger one-sided loop!, Like you did cutting through the center line, take the scissors and this time, cut about 1/3 of the way from the edge of the strip. Continue cutting until you reach the original cut.When you have finished cutting, you should have one small ring and one larger ring that are connected together.

 Start by removing the lid and label from the coffee tin. Use the label as a guide to cut a piece of construction paper to fit the can. Glue the construction paper onto the coffee tin using craft glue.If you can't use the label as a guide, use a ruler to measure the width of label area on the tin. Draw a rectangle on the construction paper that is the same width and as long as the piece of paper is. You can cut off any overlap.
 Use a hot glue gun to glue a square of fabric to the top of the coffee tin. Trim the excess fabric leaving about one to two inches of extra fabric past the glue.The square of fabric should be about double the size of the top of the tin. For example, if the lid of the tin is about 3x3 inches, the fabric square should be 6x6 inches.
 Put the lid to the coffee tin back on to secure the fabric in place and create a solid surface for the child to drum on. You can hide the edge of the lid by gluing on a ribbon over it.
 Use markers, stickers, feathers, or other decorative material to decorate the drum. You can draw designs on the paper around the drum or hang feathers down from the lid to the coffee tin. Use your imagination and have the child make the drum unique., Find lightweight wooden sticks to use as drumsticks. Use wooden dowels, chopsticks, or unsharpened pencils to drum on your new drum.

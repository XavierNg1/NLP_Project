 Vintage brands such as Puch have more complicated starting processes. First, if the lock has been engaged, start unlocking the moped using the keylock right below the handlebars. Move the handlebar to the right. Put the key inside the lock.


Be aware that different brands may require more or less steps to start.
 First turn the key to the right. When it is turned to the right, you should be able to push it in. Once you do that, turn the key back to the left until the moped is unlocked., On a Puch Maxi, for example, you’ll find the fuel valve on the right side of the moped’s frame. This is a switch you must turn off when you park the moped. You may see the “on” and “off” labels on your moped. Pull the lever into the “on” position.
 Look near the handlebars for the engine switch. On the Puch Maxi, it’s on the right side. Make sure the switch is flipped to the “run” position.
 This only needs to be done if the engine is cold from disuse. Locate the carburetor. It’ll have a small black bar poking out of it. This is the choke, which you need to press and hold. While you do this, look downwards and find the small primer button on the carburetor. Press this too., Hold the front brake, which is on the right side of the handlebars, so you keep the moped under control. Find the starting lever under the left handlebar. Keep the pedals level as you pull it., Continue holding the starting lever as you begin to pedal. The engine should start and you should be free to go. If it doesn’t start, you may need to try pedal starting it.

 Quick release knots aren't a proper hitching method for these type of horses; they soon learn how to release themselves and get away from you. Make sure you halt the horse with a proper tie and that it doesn't have more that 30–40 centimeters (11.8–15.7 in) to move its head around, so he won’t be able to bite you when you are standing right beside his belly (not giving the 30 centimeters space to horse’s neck is necessary will result in more resistance from the horse.);
, Even with a secure tie, the horse can still bite when you're at the neck, so you want to grab the halter with your hand and groom with other one. Whenever the horse wants to bite you, just push its head away, and with a calm and firm voice say “No”.


Horses test everything to make sure that they haven't got it wrong; therefore it might try a couple of times to turn his neck towards you and bite you. Don’t push his head around all the time cause it makes it uncomfortable; apply pressure whenever it’s necessary.
 This is right beside the horse's belly, where the horse’s head is unable to reach you if you apply the secure tie correctly. Now you can let go of the halter and continue grooming the horse’s belly and hindquarter.
 While you are grooming the horse’s belly and hindquarter, it might try to turn his back around to kick you, and that is total opposite of what we are trying to achieve here. So whenever he moves to do so, push his body away by pressing your body at its side and force it to stay in its space. Use a firm "No" again.
 Some horses are very sweet and kind, they like to groom you back - as they do it in nature . As long as there is no biting, it’s OK and none of the above steps are needed. Following the above steps for this type of horses will teach them bad behavior .

 Most makeup, like lip-stick or mascara, is oil-based which means that water will help the stain set, and make it harder to remove it.
 Some makeup isn't liquid, which means that it's sometimes possible to lightly brush a lip-stick or mascara stain off before it seeps into the fabric. But be very careful, as you don't want to grind the stain deeper into your jeans.


If this wasn't enough, go ahead and try the next steps below.
 Shaving cream is especially useful for foundation spills. Just cover the stain with some shaving cream, and toss your garment into the wash.


As an alternative to this step, you might consider the next one.
 If you're dealing with lipstick stains, hairspray can be quite effective at removing spills and smudges. Saturate the stained part of your jeans with the hair product for about fifteen minutes. Then blot it with a damp rag or cloth until the stain is gone.


If hairspray makes you cringe, or you don't tolerate the smell, skip to the method below.
 If you're dealing with spray tan or tinted moisturizer spots, make a mixture of warm water and a little dish detergent in a cup. Dip in a sponge and then gently blot your jeans' stain with it until your garment is clean.

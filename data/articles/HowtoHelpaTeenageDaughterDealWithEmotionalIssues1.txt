 Your teenage daughter will not open up to you if she feels she cannot trust you. How you've treated her in the past will influence this part of your relationship, but if you show genuine respect for your child's feelings, you can grow her trust in you.


Show your child that it's safe to open up to you. Even if she reveals something that is punishable (experimenting with alcohol or drugs, sneaking out, etc.) most of the time understanding is a more effective course of action than consequences.
Take off your "Parent Hat" once in a while. Your daughter will feel more comfortable telling you things if you come to her level at times instead of always acting as the authority figure. She may tell you things that don't make you particularly happy, but she will be more likely to share with you if she knows you won't explode and ground her for life.For example, if your daughter comes to you and says, "I'm thinking about sleeping with my boyfriend," talk to her about birth control, safety, and taking care of herself emotionally and physically. Don't just blurt out, "No way! You're not allowed to have sex yet!";
, Be careful how you react to the information that she may share with you. In other words, don't flip out if she says something that surprises or angers you. The way you react will either encourage or discourage her from sharing her feelings and concerns with you in the future.
 If you want her to trust you, show her what it means to be trustworthy. Do what you say you're going to do, and always keep your promises to her. Sheâ€™s watching to see how you deal with situations in your life, so she will know how to deal with the situations that arise in her own life.Practice resilience. After a stressful encounter (with your daughter or otherwise,) let her see that you have the ability to bounce back and refocus. Modeling this for her helps her learn to do the same thing.

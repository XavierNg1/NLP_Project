 As a preteen, wearing large amounts of makeup can look tacky, so remember that less is more. A little lip gloss in a soft color and maybe a little swipe of mascara once in a while is generally all you need. But only wear it if your parents are okay with it!;
, It will make your skin nice, smooth, and rich.
, Wash your face everyday to keep acne away, and to keep your face clean.
 You can shop at stores like Ralph Lauren, Tilly's, and Abercrombie and Fitch. If you cannot afford these however, shop at stores like Forever 21, Wet Seal, and Charlotte Russe. If you are too young for those, go to places like JCPenny, or Kohls, or Target. Even Justice will do.
 Being a great preteen is not just about being pretty and fashionable, but having respect for others and yourself. You must have good values in life to even try to attempt all of this. No calling names, cursing or saying anything rude. Even if someone is mean to you, they might become nicer someday, and they will be happy that you were always nice to them. You don't have to like everyone, just be polite and respect them.
, Being "sassy" is not cool, it just makes you look like a brat.
 And who knows, a boy might see you and ask you to dance with him!

, When you start middle school, you will see a bunch of kids who seem to act similar, dress similar, like similar things, and be clique-ish. Don't try to fit into one of their stereotypes, it makes you boring, un-original, and like a "poser."


Don't forget who you are! Everybody is different and nobody is the same. Wearing the same clothes or being an identical twin doesn't mean you're just like the person you look like. You're all different, and be happy with who you are.

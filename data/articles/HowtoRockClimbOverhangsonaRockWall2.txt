 Get your gear and get skilled.
 It's important to have a safe route for your first go. Make sure the holds are large, it's not too steep, and there are lots of protection points.
 You'll learn how to use the holds better without ever feeling them. Plus, you'll get stronger, which is very important.
 Introduce yourself to others at the crag or your local gym. Even if they don't want to work that route, ask them for beta if you want it. You might make a lifelong friend and climbing partner.
 If the wall has a crack, work on the right type of jams.
 With your newfound friend, your knowledge of the holds, and your technique practice, you should soar right up the route. Make sure you're rested and fed on red pointÂ day, and tell yourself positive things. If you fail, try, try again. Work the moves you've failed. Remember you have as long as you want. The routes don't disappear once you fail them.

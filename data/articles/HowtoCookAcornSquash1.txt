 On a cutting board, use a chef's knife to cut the acorn squash in half, from stem to end.;
, Place each half in a baking pan, skin-side down.


Butter the pan or use a non-stick spray to prevent the bottom of the squash from sticking to the pan.
 Sprinkle the brown sugar and maple syrup evenly onto each half.
 The squash should be very soft, and the tops browned. Remove from the oven and allow to cool before serving.

 If you’re stocking your home bar cart, take a little time to personalize it and make it your own. Themed carts are becoming popular in some circles. One favorite is a vintage-themed bar cart. You could stock it with vintage glassware and vintage-style tools. You could even go all-out and invest in a bar cart that is vintage.Sports-themed bar carts are also popular. You could deck yours out with team-themed drinks, napkins in team colors and a decal of your favorite team’s logo right on the cart.
You could also base your theme around a particular type of drink and stock the bar with only the items needed for that. For example, you could set up a martini-themed bar cart for a party.
 There are no rules about specific bar cart set ups. You can arrange yours however you’d like. You could take the practical approach and organize yours according to what you use the most. On the other hand, perhaps you have some really beautiful bottles or rare vintages – in that case, arrange your cart to showcase them.
 A basic book of cocktail recipes is good to have on hand no matter what. Of course, these days you can just keep one stored digitally in your smartphone, but traditionally every bar set up includes one of these books. Home bar set ups often have personalized recipe books, sometimes even leather-bound and monogrammed.


If you’re having a party, whip up a few signature cocktails for the event and keep the recipes listed nearby, just in case you need a reference point.

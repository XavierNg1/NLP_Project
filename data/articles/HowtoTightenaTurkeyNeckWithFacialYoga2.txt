Try to sleep on your back with your neck straight instead., The skin on your neck is thinner than in other areas of the body, and it tends to dry out and wrinkle more quickly. Use a moisturizing lotion every day to keep it firm and elastic. If you want to give it an additional boost, try a skin-firming cream that contains retinol or an anti-wrinkle formula.This will help repair the skin and keep it looking young.


Apply cream using a gentle circular motion, working from the bottom of the neck toward the chin. Avoid pulling at your skin and dragging it down, since stretching it every which way could make matters worse.
In addition to cream, you should also wear sunscreen on your neck. Sun damage can lead to wrinkles and skin damage.

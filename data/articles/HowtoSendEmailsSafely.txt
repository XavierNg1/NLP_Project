 Remember that companies will pay money for email addresses, hoping that the mail they send you will get you to buy their product. Because of this, you have to remember to minimize the amount of your contacts' email addresses you send out.;
, Instead of using the "To:" and "Cc:" forms to list recipients, use the "Bcc:" (Blind Carbon Copy). This makes the recipients unable to view who else it was sent to (including their addresses), securing the addresses from being sold.
 Remember to delete any previous information from the message when forwarding messages. Leave only the message. Any information about where the message has been and who it's been sent to should be removed.
 There are many e-mail petitions out there, or scams saying that they're trying to make a world record by having a lot of signatures. Don't sign these! They're just ways of collecting lots of email addresses to either attack with a virus or sell to a company.

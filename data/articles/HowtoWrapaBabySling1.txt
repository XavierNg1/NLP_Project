 Before you can master the different methods for wrapping your baby in a sling, you need to learn how to fold and secure the sling itself. If your sling does not have rings, you’ll cross the fabric and secure it with a knot. To begin, fold the entire length of the fabric so that it isn’t as wide.


Do not twist the sling. You want it smooth and even.;
, Take the folded fabric and wrap it against your stomach. Check the placement – you want the middle of the fabric to be hugging your stomach.
 Bring the ends of the fabric, criss-crossed, around your back, so that the crossed ends come over your shoulders and hang over your chest.
 Take the ends of the fabric hanging over your chest and cross them again, tucking each end under and through the fabric on your waist.
 Bring the ends of the fabric around your back again.


Note that if your fabric is still too long, you can repeat this process, bringing the sling around your front and back until it’s a good length to tie in a knot.
 Tie the ends together in a knot, and smooth out any crumples and creases.

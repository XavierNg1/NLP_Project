 Locate the Copy app on your iPad. It’s the app with a white background with an origami crane. Tap on it to launch it.
 If you’re already logged in, you may skip this step. Otherwise, input your Copy email address and password, and then tap the “Login” button.
 Navigate through your Copy folders by tapping on them until you’re in the folder where the items you want to share are located. Navigation is done on the left panel.


Once inside the proper folder, tap the icon of three small squares found on the lower right corner of the left panel. Doing so will add selection circles on all the items inside the folder. Tap on the circles of the files and folders you want to share.
You can select multiple items.
 After your selection, tap the Share link found on the bottom toolbar of the left panel. A submenu of Share Simply options will be shown. Tap on the Facebook icon for Post to Facebook.


A Facebook post window will appear where you can type in your message and set the audience level.
 In the message box, type in your message to go with the share link. You may also define the level of audience this post will be visible to by tapping the Audience option.
 Once you’re done, tap the Post button found at the upper-right corner of the Facebook post window. The post containing the share link will be posted on your Facebook wall.


Your Facebook account must be properly configured and integrated with Copy for this to work.

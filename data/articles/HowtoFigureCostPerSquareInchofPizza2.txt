 The formula is A=l×w{\displaystyle A=l\times w} where l{\displaystyle l} equals the length of the rectangle, and w{\displaystyle w} equals the width of the rectangle., Usually menus will only give you one measurement. You will have to contact the restaurant and ask if they will provide you with the length and width of the pizza. If it is a square pizza, the length and width will be the same.

For example, you might want to find the value of a square 16-inch pizza. Both the length and the width will be 16 inches.
 Due to the commutative property of multiplication, It doesn’t matter which dimension you use for the length and which you use for the width.

For example, for a square 16-inch pizza, your formula will look like this: A=16×16{\displaystyle A=16\times 16}.
 This will give you the area of the pizza in square inches.

For example:A=16×16{\displaystyle A=16\times 16}A=256{\displaystyle A=256}So, the area of a square 16-inch pizza is 256 square inches.
 This will give you the cost per square inch of the pizza.

For example, if a pizza costs $32 and has an area of 256 square inches, you would calculate 32÷256=.125{\displaystyle 32\div 256=.125}. So, the cost per square inch of pizza is about .13, or 13 cents.
 The pizza with the lowest cost per square inch will have the best value. However, you should only compare similar types of pizzas when looking for the best value (for example, two veggie pizzas). A pizza with fewer toppings will cost less per square inch than a pizza with several toppings, but that doesn’t necessarily make it the best value.

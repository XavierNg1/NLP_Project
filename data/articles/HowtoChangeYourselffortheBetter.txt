 No matter who it is, always be nice to people. Don't judge people by their social status or discriminate. Everyone is human, so treat them that way.
 Hating won't get you anywhere. Try to become friends with everyone, even your enemies. Try to like them and have them like you. Don't hold grudges and never seek revenge. Being vengeful causes you to keep carrying the burden and will make everything worse for you., Swearing constantly is debasing and a lazy way of communicating. Watching your language will help you to stay happy. Also, never swear at someone., Give back to the community. Volunteer, donate. Try making a goal. Maybe do some community service every week,, Stay Happy! Don't say "I hate this or I hate that." Replace it with "I'll try it, I'll give it a go and keep an open mind about it.", Be happy on the inside out and smile often. Let people feel that they can rely upon you and come to you in times of need.

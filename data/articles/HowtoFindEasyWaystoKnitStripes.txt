 This is a plastic tube you slide onto a needle that counts rows for you. You can purchase a little knitting counter from any good knitting or craft supplies store. Use this counter to help you keep track of the stripes rather than trying to keep the numbers in your head and forgetting them instantly when distracted! This saves a lot of time when you count down or mark the rows.;
, If you do this, it will cut down on the number of ends that need to be sewn (darned) in later.
 This way they will stay neat and the look remains seamless.
 They do the work for you and create the stripes as you knit! Make sure you know the effect before starting your project; ask your knitting supplier salesperson to help you with this.

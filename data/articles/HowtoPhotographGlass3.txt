 This setup results in a brightly illuminated glass object, with black lines creating a silhouette-like effect. Color and detail are generally easier to emphasize compared to the white-line setup, and the bright lighting can make weak reflections and glare invisible., Place the glass in a black photo box if you have one, or surround it with black matte barriers underneath, behind, and to each side of the object. Pull these side barriers close together, or use additional barriers, to block light from the front and leave only a small gap for your camera lens.


You can hold off on completely enclosing the area until after the setup below is complete, but keep this final goal in mind.
You may need to use a "ceiling" for the area as well, if reflections are getting in over the top of the walls.
 This can be white or grey; the brighter the light source you'll be using, the darker this panel can be. Set this up directly behind the object from the perspective of the camera, and make it no wider than the object itself. If the panel is too wide, you could end up with white reflections or lens flare interfering with the clean, silhouetted appearance., You can use a specialized diffuser, or imitate the effect by covering your light source with a white tissue. Point this at the background panel. Use flags or barriers if necessary to avoid illuminating the glass directly. You're going for a soft "spotlight" effect on the background, which will in turn send light through the glass toward the camera.


You can also try illuminating the glass directly from behind, sending the light through a sheet of white acrylic or a transparent canvas.This setup may be more difficult to adjust.
 Photograph the glass, and take a look at the result. If you aren't satisfied, adjust the brightness of the light source, or use additional photo flags or barriers to eliminate undesirable reflections.

 Corrective pruning helps direct more energy toward the foliage. As a result, you will end up seeing more dramatic flower production once the days start getting shorter.


Avoid hard or major prunings during the heat of the summer. Knockout roses are already stressed due to the heat, so a major pruning could only weaken them further.
 Pruning to stimulate growth is not necessary, but if you want to maintain a beautiful rose bush, you might need to do a little pruning for this purpose.


If a few new shoots start growing faster than the others and quickly exceed the length of other surrounding shoots, you can trim the long shoots down so that the plant is uniformly even.
In addition to growing upward, shoots will also grow below the plant and outward. This "leggy" under-growth should also be trimmed away throughout the growing season.
 Throughout the active growing season, the majority of your pruning should be for the sake of keeping the plant healthy. This is primarily done by removing parts of the plant that could damage the plant further if left alone.


Diseased parts of the plant should be removed immediately to prevent the disease from spreading. Similarly, dead and damaged wood is an invitation for fungi and bacteria to attack the plant, making it vulnerable, so these elements should also be removed as soon as possible.
 Deadheading is the practice of cutting away large or faded flowers. This can be done for both aesthetic reasons and health reasons.


Cut just above the five-leaflet closest to the flower cluster or the first five-leaflet leaf below the flower cluster.
During extreme heat, only cut back to just above a leaf rather than going further down the stem. Cutting off faded flowers 6 to 8 inches (15.25 to 20.32 cm) below the flower is appropriate.

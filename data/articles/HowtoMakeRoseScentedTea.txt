 Oolong is an excellent choice for this recipe. If not, ask for advice from your local tea specialist.;
, If you haven't already dried the rose petals, you will need to do so. Select only high quality petals from highly scented rose varieties. If you don't grow your own roses, ask a neighbour for some petals. Always be sure to check that the petals are not sprayed with chemical preparations. It is also possible to purchase dried rose petals at specialty stores.
 When the petals are evenly distributed through the tea, it is ready for storing.
 Tea lasts best in tins (they block out the light and prevent odour cross-contamination). However, if giving as a gift, it is prettier when presented in a glass jar or cellophane packet, with a ribbon; you could also add a storage tin with it.
 Make the tea as per the instructions for the quality tea. The tea will have a delightful rose-scented flavour. Serve with rose flavoured treats such as Turkish delight or rose petal jam on scones.

For herby tuna fish patties, add parsley, dill and garlic powder.
For spicy tuna fish patties, add dijon mustard, tabasco and chopped green onions or chives.
For creamy tuna fish patties (with a kick) add cream of mushroom soup and some Worcester sauce.
Tuna patties are very versatile, so you can also experiment with your own combination of herbs, spices, vegetables and other flavorings!

, Use a fork to mix all of the ingredients together, until they achieve an even consistency.
 Take about 1/4 of the patty mixture in your hands and roll it to form a ball, then use the palm of your hand to flatten it into a patty.


Do the same with the remaining mixture, then place the patties on a baking tray lined with wax paper.
If you have time, allow the patties to chill for an hour in the refrigerator. This helps them to hold their shape during cooking.
 Olive or sunflower oil will both work, although a little butter is great for adding flavor. For healthier patties, use a low-fat cooking spray.
 This should only take 3 to 4 minutes on each side.
 Serve the tuna patties with a wedge of lemon, some tartar sauce or sprinkled with a bit of dill. You can also serve the patties on slider buns to make tuna burgers.

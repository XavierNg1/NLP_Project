 When practicing or teaching your toddler to self feed, try to prepare the area where you will feed her to lessen your frustration (and added work!) and capitalize on her success, which is the most important part in this whole experience. When feeding, make sure that there aren’t other things on her table or nearby that will distract her from eating.
 Put down a mat or towel under the bowl or plate you give to your child. Doing this will make cleanup easier. You can also protect your child from spills by putting a toddler bib on her. The bib should cover most of your toddler’s chest so that her clothing is protected.


If you don’t have a bib, dress your child in old clothing that you don’t have an attachment to. By doing this, you won’t have to go through the hassle of trying to get a stain out if your child spills on herself.
 Sit your toddler at the dining room table together with the whole family during Mealtime. Yes, it can be quite a long Mealtime when you have to wait for her to finish her meal, but it is important that she see every member of the family eating with utensils.


Keep in mind that you and your family are role models. Show her how you use your utensils so that she learns by observation.
 Encouragement and praise are key to helping your toddler use her own utensils. When she finishes her meal on her own, however messy it got, praise her and tell her she did a good job. This will give her confidence the next time she eats.

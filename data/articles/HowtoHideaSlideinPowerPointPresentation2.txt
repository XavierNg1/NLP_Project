 You may wish to create a link to the hidden slide so that you can still access it while in presentation mode. It can sometimes be embarrassing to switch back to editing mode during a presentation.
 Click the Insert tab from the top of the window. This tab controls everything you can insert into a slide, including pictures, videos, etc.
 Highlight the text you wish to create a link from. This will be what you click to access the hidden slide during a presentation, so choose a place that makes sense. You may wish to add some text at the end of the presentation saying something like, "More information," and creating the link from that text.
 Click the Hyperlink button from the options within the Insert tab.


Choose Place in this document from the options on the left side of the pop-up window.
Select the hidden slide and click the OK button from the bottom right of the window.

 Though you may be tempted to scratch at the itchy areas on your belly, try to resist this urge. Scratching at the itchy areas will only irritate it further and spread the itch to other areas of your belly. This is because you are stimulating substances in your skin that cause you to scratch your belly even more., Try not to expose your itchy belly to heat, such as hot showers or hot baths. The heat will only irritate the itchy areas more.You should also avoid using harsh soaps or bath products with irritating fragrances or ingredients. They will only make your itch worse. Instead, go for mild, glycerin based soaps as they will be less irritating.

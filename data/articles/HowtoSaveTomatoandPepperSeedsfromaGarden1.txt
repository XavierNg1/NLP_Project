 For example if you grow "Beefsteak" tomatoes and harvest seeds, more than likely they will produce some different, inferior tomato the following year. With tomatoes, the seeds you want to harvest are "Heirloom" tomatoes. Heirloom seeds are simply a variety where the seed can be harvested form a plant, saved, replanted, and the same variety will regrow the following year.;
, Often you can simply scoop of the seeds from the tomato that you are about to eat. Collecting seeds from overly ripe fruit is also a great idea too. So, collect your seeds depending on what works best for you.
 There are methods out there for fermenting the seeds to achieve this. However, you can also simply to put the seeds in a fine mesh colander, and run water over them. Maybe run your fingers over them to help the little fellas out. You know when you are done, because the seeds should stop clumping in a big messy mass.
 Then place them between a couple of sheets of paper towels for a day or until completely dry.
 Keep them in a place you'll remember easily, so that you can plant them next season.

 Focus on how you will search for processes that do not hamper any employee's ability to perform his or her job properly, but that will enhance the enterprise's overall value.;

Look for local, state or federal laws, grants or tax breaks that your organization can use. Write down what conditions you need to meet in order to qualify.



For instance, if you work with highly polluting materials, the goals could be to find alternative, eco-friendly materials and find green ways of disposing of waste products.
If your company produces intellectual property such as graphic design, then your environmental management plan could focus on recycling office supplies, using less energy and moving to a green property to conduct business.
It can be helpful to decide on a timeline to implement change. For example, "By 2015 we will reduce our energy consumption by 10 percent and use primarily green power sources."

If your goal is to reduce energy consumption, a process could be to always turn off office computers when leaving at the end of the day. This could be implemented by installing alerts on employees' computers at the close of business or by appointing somebody to check that all computers are turned off. The progress can be measured by comparing energy use on the office's energy bill before and after the policy was implemented.
The process could be more lengthy if your goal is to find alternative materials. This involves finding materials that are as practical and cost effective as the current materials. If alternatives are found, but prove to be costly, find out which incentives, grants or tax breaks will provide a solution. If none is forthcoming, you'll need to continue the search for a more cost effective alternative.
 Periodic reports and press releases can provide an effective way of sharing your achievements.
 Provide graphs or images to illustrate your points, if necessary. Distribute it to your business partners, employees and other interested parties.

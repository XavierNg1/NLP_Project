 Before you get to the store, explain your rules to your children. You can't expect them to behave if you don't lay out what behavior you want from them. Plus, telling them right before you go in keeps them from weaseling out of situation by saying they didn't know any better., If you try to skip over snack or nap time, your children will just be cranky. Try to go after you've finished both of these activities. You can get around the snack time one a bit by bringing snacks with you for your kids to snack on. Keep in mind, though, some stores may frown upon your kids having outside snacks around the merchandise., If you aren't going to a store with shopping carts, you're going to want to have someplace that will help keep your kid contained. A stroller is ideal, as it keeps your child near you while also keeping them from getting too tired from walking around., Think about what you need to buy, and map out the best route around the store. Make it as efficient as possible, so you don't need to spend more time in the store than you have to. You can get in and get out with little fuss.

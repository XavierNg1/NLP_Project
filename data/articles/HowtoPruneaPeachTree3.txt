 You can remove the following growth at any time of year:


Dead or fungus-infected branches
Suckers: the shoots that come up near the roots of the tree.
Water shoots growing from the top branches
Dried fruit from the previous year’s harvest

, This is the most important step in pruning, as it is responsible for the ultimate growth pattern and fruit production of the tree. You want to choose 4-6 primary branches to work with, and cut off all the rest.


All the branches you cut should be growing up at a 45 degree angle. Any branches that grow vertically or horizontally need to be removed, as they are likely to break when the tree begins bearing fruit.
Prune your tree in a V-shaped pattern. All branches should have the appearance of the letter “V.”
Cut off any branches that cross over each other, since these block sunlight. The best shape for a peach tree is an open vase, with a clear center to maximize sun.Remove any branches on which the new growth is growing upwards above your head. This will make it difficult to pick the fruit.
 You want to cut the tree at the same angle of growth, about ¼ an inch from the lateral bud.


Avoid cutting the branch at too steep an angle or too close to the collar at the base, as this opens it up for infection.
For branches exceeding 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter, use three cuts to aid in pruning. Make the first cut about halfway up the branch from the underside. Then, make a cut from the top down about one inch further. The weight of the branch will help the branch to break easily. Then, make your cut near the collar of the branch.

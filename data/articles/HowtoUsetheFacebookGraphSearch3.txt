 If you have never used Graph Search before, activate this feature using this link: www.facebook.com/about/graphsearch. Once the page opens up, click on the “Try Graph Search” link.
 To search for people, pages, groups, photos, music, restaurants and the like using this method, you need to use very specific keywords or a combination of those.


For example, in the Search box, you can write “Photos of my friends taken in Paris”, “Pages liked by my friends,” “Photos of Coffee Shops in San Francisco, California,” “Friends who live nearby,” “Italian restaurants in Dubai,” “Music liked by (insert name of a friend),” and so on.
 Choose the one you think is closest to what you are looking for.
 Using advanced filtering in your search will enable you to zero in on what you want. Once you’ve clicked on a retrieved suggestion, you should see an advanced search box on the right side of the page that opens up.


Click on the “SEE MORE FILTERS” link, and select your preferences from the drop-down menu for each of the filtering options.
Your preferences will automatically update the results displayed on the page.

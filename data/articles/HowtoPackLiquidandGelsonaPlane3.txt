 If you have checked baggage, this is less of a concern, since you can pack liquids and gels weighing more than 3.4 ounces (100 ml/g) in that. However, if you only have a carry-on, remember that any liquid or gel souvenirs that you purchase must be that size or less. Also keep in mind that they will have to fit into your single 1-quart (1 L) bag for non-essential liquids and gels. Limit your purchases by size and quantity accordingly.Also keep this in mind when deciding on what non-essential items to bring on the flight there. To make room for the return-trip, consider only bringing items that you can jettison at the end of your stay.
 Make packing for the return trip that much easier by shipping liquid and gel souvenirs separately. Ask retailers if they offer shipping themselves. If not, bring your purchases to a parcel service like UPS, FedEx, or DHL to pack and ship your items home.If you are travelling internationally, be aware that your items may be subject to customs fees upon delivery, depending on the item and countries in question.
 If you are travelling internationally, consider saving any souvenir shopping for liquids and gels for the flight back. Make your purchases before your flight at the duty-free stores located within the airportâ€™s secure area. These items are exempt from carry-on rules, as long as:The sealed, clear security bag provided by the store at the time of purchase has not been opened or otherwise tampered with.
You keep your receipt for inspection.

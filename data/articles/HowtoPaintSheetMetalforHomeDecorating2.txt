 A primer, sometimes referred to as an undercoat, is a preparatory substance that allows paint to adhere better to surfaces. The primer also adds a layer of rust-protective coating to the metal and keeps the paint from peeling.


Brush or spray on the primer. Rust-resistant primers are available in both spray paint and brush-on options. Apply 2 thin coats of the primer, allowing the first coat to dry completely before applying the second coat.

  This basically means to be yourself.  Everyone's different, and everyone has differences.  Accept that you aren't the flawless, super prettiest person in the world. Someone in the world does think you're pretty without any makeup at all.  Don't change your personality because you think you're not sexy or popular enough, because you'll regret it.  So basically just be yourself and chill.
  Confidence makes you look prettier.  Don't care about what others think of you. Don't whine about how ugly and fat you think you are everyday.  It's annoying, and unattractive. Be super confident, and walk tall and straight.  Be confident with your body, personality, because as sad as you may feel, you can't change yourself, and you don't need to because you're already awesome!

,  Smiling lights everyone's day up.  Smile as much as you can, and look happy most of the time.  Make sure you laugh a lot, and don't take everything so seriously.  Be happy, and don't give a fake, forced smile, just give a normal, kind, genuine smile.  Do it to anyone, they usually smile back.

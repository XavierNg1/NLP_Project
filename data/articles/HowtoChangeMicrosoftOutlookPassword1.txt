 This will display the "Account Information" screen.


If you're using Outlook 2003, click the Tools menu and select "E-mail Accounts.";
, This will open a new window with all of your connected accounts.


If you're using Outlook 2003, select "View or change existing email accounts."

, Note that you'll be changing the password that Outlook uses to access the account, not that account's actual password. If you need to change the password that protects your email account, you'll need to do that through your email service. For example, to change your Gmail password visit the Google Account Recovery website first, then change the password in Outlook.


If you want to change the password used to protect your Outlook data file, see the next section.
 This will open the details of the account you selected.
 You'll find this in the "Logon Information" section.


Remember, this does not change your actual email password. This only changes the password that Outlook tries when it accesses your account.
 Outlook will test the account and attempt to login with the password you provided. If everything is successful, you'll get a "Congratulations!" message.

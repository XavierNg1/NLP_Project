 Rinse the melon under running water and scrub it thoroughly with a vegetable brush. This will remove dirt and pathogens from the skin, and prevent food-borne illnesses., Lay the cantaloupe on its side on a cutting board. Hold the melon steady and trim half an inch (1.3 cm) from the top and bottom to remove the stem scars. This will also give you a flat surface to rest the cantaloupe on, and make peeling the rind easier., Turn the cantaloupe and stand it on the flat top that you just cut. With a sharp knife, carefully cut from top to bottom to remove strips of rind from the melon, following the rounded contour of the fruit. Turn the melon and continue cutting until you’ve removed all the rind. Then go around again and cut off any leftover green sections.As you peel the rind and green flesh from the cantaloupe, try to preserve as much of the edible orange flesh as possible.
 Once the rind and green have been cut from the melon, cut the cantaloupe in half through the center. Place the halves cut-side up on a flat surface. Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds from the center, but don’t scoop out the sweet and juicy orange flesh.

The seeds can either be discarded into a compost bin or cleaned and roasted like pumpkin seeds., Turn the cantaloupe halves over so they're cut-side down on the cutting board. Cut each halve into 1-inch (2.5-cm) strips. Then cut those strips widthwise to form 1-inch (2.5-cm) cantaloupe cubes.Once the cubes are cut, you can eat them alone with your fingers or a fork, turn them into other treats, or add them to your favorite foods.
 Transfer any leftover cantaloupe chunks to an airtight container. Store them in the refrigerator for about three days. For longer storage, keep the cantaloupe in the freezer for up to a year.

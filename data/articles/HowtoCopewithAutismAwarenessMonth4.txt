 Each time you think a bad thought about yourself, stop to consider it. Would you talk to an autistic friend that way? Would you be okay with someone saying this out loud? If not, consider what kind words and advice you would give to a friend who had been told the same thing you told yourself. Then apply it to yourself.
 If you notice yourself falling into anxiety or a guilt spiralÂ , stop. Do one or two relaxation exercises. Then try to be mindful of your thoughts and feelings, without placing value judgments on yourself or trying to read other people's minds.
 Repressing negative feelings won't help you. It's okay to feel down when people are saying awful things about you and your community, and when others are supporting the group that does this. Give yourself time to process your pain, instead of pushing it to the side and letting it bottle up.
 If you're routinely feeling upset or down about yourself, tell someone you trust. You aren't being selfish by sharing your sadness; in fact, other people can usually tell that you're unhappy, and would rather have you open up to them than keep wondering and worrying about what's wrong. You deserve support, and you are not a burden.

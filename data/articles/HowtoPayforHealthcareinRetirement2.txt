 Working part time or as a consultant when you retire will give you money to pay for your premiums and out of pocket expenses whether you are on Medicare or have a private plan.


Have a tax planner or financial specialist help you determine how much you can earn without making yourself ineligible for programs such as Medicare and Social Security.
 You will need to dedicate some of that income to paying for your health insurance and covering ineligible expenses such as co-pays and deductibles.
 If you plan to stay in your home and your mortgage is paid off or almost paid off, you can take a home equity loan or line of credit to help cover healthcare costs, especially if you are faced with a large and unexpected medical bill.
 For example, if you have an expensive surgery or cancer treatment and you cannot afford the co-pay, prescriptions or other costs, friends and family can raise money for you.


Check out sites such as YouCaring.com, Fundly.com and GiveForward.com. You might be able to afford your healthcare just by asking for help.

 Your city or state may have an organization that focuses on advocacy or services for the blind. If they are not hosting a celebration for the upcoming White Cane Day, they can likely let you know of any celebrations in your area.


If you are interested in helping organizing an event, it's important to have the guidance of those who have established themselves as allies and advocates of blind people's rights and culture.
If you are unable to find a local organization in your area, search online for a nearby school for the blind. They will be the best source of knowledge about local organizations that may be organizing or hosting an event for White Cane Day.
 Many communities host annual celebrations of White Cane Day. These often include remarks by legislators, local advocates, and other community members. Further, there are often planned activities for everyone, regardless of oneâ€™s ability to see.These celebrations may include some unexpected activities. For instance, last year's celebration in one U.S. city included a climbing wall.
Government websites are the best places to find out about planned events. You can also call your town hall directly and ask what official events are planned in your area.
 Many White Cane Day celebrations include walks or marches. Often, canes and blindfolds will be provided to those who can see, but who want to participate alongside blind people and experience what it is like to be a blind pedestrian. Specific routes will be planned in advance, and may even stop at politically or culturally relevant locations.Note that not all communities will have White Can Day celebrations. The larger cities in your area, especially the state capital, are more likely locations for white cane walks and marches.

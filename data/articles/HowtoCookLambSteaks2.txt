 Lamb steaks taste best when they are seared with high heat or fire, so broiling or grilling are the optimal cooking methods. Allow the broiler or grill to fully heat up before proceeding.


If you're using a grill, let the coals burn until the fire dies down and the coals glow bright red. The steaks must be grilled over very high heat.
If you'd prefer to use a stovetop method, heat a cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Allow it to get very hot.
 Use tongs to transfer them from the marinade to the rack or grill. Reserve the extra marinade in its container. Arrange the steaks so that they are all centered over high heat with no overlap. If you're using a cast iron skillet, you may need to cook your steaks in more than one batch.
 Let the steaks cook on one side for thirty seconds, then quickly flip them to cook on the other side for thirty seconds. This keeps the steaks moist inside as they cook. Let the steaks continue cooking on the second side for five minutes., Use leftover marinade to baste the steaks as they cook. A basting brush or barbecue mop is the best tool for the job.
 After three minutes, remove the steaks to a serving platter. This cooking time results in a medium rare steak that's still pink in the middle.


If you prefer medium to well done steaks, let them cook for an extra 30 seconds to 1 minute.
If you prefer rare steaks, remove them after the last side has cooked for 2 minutes.

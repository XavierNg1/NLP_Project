 A great way to add more protein to your diet is with a protein shake. These ready-to-go shakes can provide you with an extra dose of protein. Some can even replace a meal. If you are a vegetarian, go for a plant-based shake such as one that includes rice or soy protein., Seeds and nuts are wonderful sources of protein that can be eaten on the go or as a topping on everyday foods like salad. Try a handful of walnuts and almonds for an easy snack. You can also top your salad or smoothie with a sprinkling of chia, hemp, or pumpkin seeds.One serving of nuts is about one ounce.
 If you’re looking to add protein to your diet, a nutrition bar with a high protein content is a great place to start. Opt for bars that have at least 10 grams of protein and no more than 10 grams of sugar. Keep one in your purse or briefcase for a quick protein-rich pick-me-up at the office or after the gym.
 If you are concerned you’re not getting enough protein, or if you are just looking to add more to your diet, consider tracking your food intake on a nutrition app. Apps can help you determine exactly how much protein is in your daily meals and even alert you when you need to eat more. Some apps to consider are:MyFitnessPal
LoseIt
SparkPeople

, If an app doesn’t feel like the right fit, you can track your protein intake in a journal each day. Try writing down everything you eat each day. This will help you keep track of exactly what you’re eating and give you the tools to add more protein if you see a deficiency.

 Part of the recovery process includes talking to someone who believes you and who you trust. This person should be someone who accepts that you are the victim and who doesn’t blame you. Share with the person how you feel, both the good and the bad things.You may say, “I appreciate that you believe me and don’t blame me for what happened. I would like to talk about what happened to me. I think it will help me stop blaming myself.”

, If you are struggling with recovering from victim-blaming, you may want to consider professional help. Talking to a licensed mental health professional may help you learn effective strategies to cope and move on.Look for a counselor in your area who specializes in victim blaming or trauma.
Be sure to seek professional help if you start experiencing secondary affects from the abuse, such as isolation, self-harm, and depression.
 Talking about what has happened to you can help you process. It may also help to talk through how people around you and society makes you feel guilty even though you are the victim. A support group for other trauma or abuse survivors, or a support group for victims, may help.Look online or contact a local hospital to find support groups in your area.
You may consider an online support group if you don’t feel like going to one in person.

 Learn as much as you can before immersing yourself into the business world. Consider that you will be running a small business first, and a beauty company second. If you can't make it to any classes, find out as much as you can by using library books or search the internet for books on how to open a beauty supply store or beauty supply institutes as references.;
, Are you interested in selling luxury products, skin care products, hair products, or ethnic-focused products? The amount of products you sell can be increased once you begin to make a profit, but until then keep the lines your stock limited to a few solid and trusted brands, and maybe a few wild cards.
 Find out what people like, and where you can obtain the most popular items cheapest wholesale.
 Do you plan to have a physical local, or do you plan to limit yourself to the internet? Remember that it's best to start small. It's better to outgrow your remodeled garage than to have to downsize from your huge downtown rental.
 This includes budgets, product info, building and business permit info, everything . Keeping track of some things may seem meaningless now, but a few months down the line you will be happy you did.'

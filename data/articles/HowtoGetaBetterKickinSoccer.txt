 Make sure you don't stand too far away, though, or the ball won't make it into the net. If you're on a regulation sized field, a little more than outside the box should be far enough.;
, Make sure the spot that you put it on isn't in a hole, or near one, or you can hurt your ankle trying to kick it.
,, When following through, you should land on the foot that you kicked the ball with.
 When you are kicking with power, you should always use your laces. Using your toe usually results in inaccuracy and a loss of power.

 It is likely that an adult will ask you questions and sometimes they may even offend you, but if you always answer politely or politely say something like "I don't feel comfortable answering that question" they will find that to be acceptable.;
,, For example, if they were to ask you how your family is, do not tell stories about how much you dislike your own family, they will think you are rude and unappreciative.
 Find things they are interested in that you don't know much about and show an interest in it. Maybe ask them questions about the things they are interested in and ask them to teach you about them; people are known to feel special or important if they can share wisdom they possess with others.
 Depending on the person they may be very accepting or not as much. Feel comfortable in a conversation, make jokes that THEY will find funny and have an open sense of humor to their jokes. Don't fake laugh at their jokes if they are not funny, maybe add a comment to the end of the joke to make it even funnier and it will also make them laugh more.
 If you want one adult to like you, have both or all adults like you. Make the whole family like you if you can. Word spreads fast in families, if one person likes you they will tell others how polite and nice you are, and if you make the same impression on others, they will know it is true.
 If they take you somewhere and buy you food or something, next time you have money do the same for them, or at least offer. Maybe ask them if they would like a Starbucks or something if you are passing by in the vehicle and tell them you will treat them, and if they accept the offer they will appreciate you a lot.

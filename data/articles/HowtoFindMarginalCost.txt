 Make sure to include the following in your chart:


Quantities. You will want to devote the first column in your chart to the total number of units produced. Your quantities can increase by 1, such as 1,2,3,4 etc. or they can increase by larger increments, such as 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 etc.
Fixed costs and variable costs. During production there are certain costs, such as rent, that are fixed. Other costs, such as the cost of materials are variable according to the quantity. Make columns for each of the costs next to the quantities and input the figures.;
, You can also choose to do the work on a spreadsheet; however, you can understand the marginal cost calculation better if you write out the formula initially.


,,


If you are using a spreadsheet program, you can insert a formula in the total cost column that will add together the fixed and variable costs on each row to calculate total cost.


, Your first line in the column will remain blank, because you cannot figure out a marginal cost based on no units of production.
 $40 minus $30.
 For example, 2 minus 1.
 For example, Marginal Cost=$10/1. In this case, the marginal cost is $10.
 Continue to subtract figures from the row above to figure out marginal cost for the remaining units of production.

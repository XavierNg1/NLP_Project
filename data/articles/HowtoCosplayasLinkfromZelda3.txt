 Unfortunately Link was never written any dialogue except for two instances where he said “come on.” Since every other character speaks in the game, many believe he is a mute. This should be even easier for you to mimic! When in doubt shut your mouth., If there is one characteristic trait that you can mimic, it’s being a confident hero. Link never runs from a challenge or says no to others.
 Link bears the spirit of the hero.To convey this in a lifelike cosplay scenario, you must showcase good posture. A trick you can use to help your posture is by imagining a coat hanger on your upper torso.
 Depending on the event you go to, you might need to have a few trademark Link moves up your sleeve. A snapshot of Link’s sounds and attacks is in the Smash Bros game for Nintendo. Do the best you can to make sounds like Link by saying:

”Strike”
”Hyeeeh”
”Kyaah”

 Sign them up for Facebook if they don’t have an account already. Check their profiles every so often to see if they’ve uploaded any new photos or posted status updates. Comment on their posts and tag them in things you think they’d find interesting.Download the Facebook app on your cell phone so you can get notifications anytime a member of your family messages you or comments on your profile.
Change your Facebook settings so you get updates whenever members of your family make a post.
 With Snapchat you can easily send videos of yourself at work, home, or out having fun to members of your family. Use Snapchat to check in on the everyday things you’re family is up to that you’d normally miss out on being away from them.Create personalized "stories" on Snapchat that only your family members can see. Upload your photos and videos to your story instead of sending them to each member of your family individually.
If you have a question or you need to tell a member of your family something, send a video over Snapchat instead of texting them. A video with your face and voice will be more personal than a typed-out message.
 Tag them in pictures you upload that you want them to see. Visit their profiles to see if they’ve uploaded any new photos and like and comment on their pictures to let them know you’re keeping up with their lives.


Make up a hashtag for your family to use on Instagram. When you upload a photo or video you want your family to see, use the hashtag in the description.

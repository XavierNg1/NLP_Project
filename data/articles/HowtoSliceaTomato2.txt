 Mandolines are a staple cutting tool for professionals chefs and at-home meal makers alike and are handy for making lots of uniform cuts quickly. Follow the manufactureâ€™s setup instructions so that your mandoline is standing upright on your cutting board. , This will determine the thickness of your tomato slices.


Depending on the make and model of your mandoline, you can dial-in or adjust your blade's distance from the mandoline's body to make thicker or thinner slices.
Make sure your blades are sharp -- this will help you make really thin slices without seizing up the machine or ripping the tomato.
 Mandolines almost always come with a hand-guard to hold the object you're planning to cut.


Some models have spikes inside the holder to help secure slippery items like tomatoes.
Mandoline blades can be very sharp and can slice neatly into exposed fingertips, so always use the hand-guard to protect yourself!

, The mandoline is going to do most of this for you.


Start at the top of the mandoline body and slide the tomato and hand-guard down and over the blades.
Try using a slight zig-zag motion to move over the blades; this will help to cut through the tomato's skin and not squish it.
Return to the top and drag down again to create another slice. Keep repeating this step until you reach the end of your tomato.
 Your slices will all be same thickness, which is especially great for even cooking times and ensuring everything is cooked.

This is especially useful if you are overweight or obese. Excess weight could be a source of elevated triglyceride levels.
Most women should aim to consume 1,200 calories per day, while most men should aim for 1,800 calories per day (this may vary depending on activity level and other factors). If you are in graver need of losing weight or lowering your calories, your doctor may put you on special diet involving even fewer calories, but you should not put yourself on such a diet without approval from your doctor.
Also avoid snacking late at night before you go to sleep.
 Consuming smaller, more frequent meals is better than eating two or three large ones.



Resist the temptation to set a rigorous exercise regimen. You may think that starting out with a challenging exercise program will lower your triglycerides quicker, but this is a bad move in the long run. Starting with something too difficult increases the likelihood of you quitting the program sooner. Begin by introducing 10 minutes of exercise into your daily routine, adding a minute or two every week until you can comfortably reach 30 to 40 minutes.
Add variety to your routine. Walk one day, bike another, and follow an exercise DVD on yet another. Get creative. By introducing variety into your exercise program, you can keep things from getting boring. It may also help you to find a form of exercise you actually consider to be fun!

Smoking contributes to several "cardiovascular risk factors," including increased blood clotting, damage to the arteries, and worse control of "lipid levels" (including triglycerides) in the blood.
If you quit smoking it will dramatically improve multiple areas of your health. See if you can find a program in your area that helps people with the process of quitting. Or, visit your physician, who can also provide guidance and support.

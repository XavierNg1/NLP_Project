 Your local auto or home improvement store will carry wipes designed to clean and protect your car’s hard interior surfaces. If you’re wary of using harsher chemicals, try using baby wipes instead. Wipe down all hard surfaces and, if you’re left with any slick residue or lint, use a microfiber towel for the cleanest finish., Wipes and clothes will be clumsy if you have to remove trash particles or grime from cupholders, air conditioner vents, and other tight surfaces. Fortunately, there are a variety of household tools you can use to make the job easier.Dab your swab, foam brush, or toothbrush in water or any mild cleaning solution then use it to get inside your car interior’s nooks and crannies.
 Pour three tablespoons of baking soda into a plastic baggie. Add two or three drops of a your favorite essential oil, like lavender or rosemary. Mix the baggie to combine the ingredients, and then let them rest for 24 hours so the soda absorbs all of the oil.Sprinkle the mixture over your car’s upholstered surfaces and floor. Leave it for 10 to 15 minutes, then vacuum it up to remove unpleasant odors.
 A shop vac or wet/dry vac with multiple attachments is the best tool to use to vacuum your car’s interior. You can also use your household vacuum’s hose and attachments to do the job. Make sure to remove the floor mats and vacuum underneath the seats.Use the narrow attachment to vacuum crumbs away from tight spots. The soft bristle attachment is great for removing dust from plastic panels and other hard surfaces.

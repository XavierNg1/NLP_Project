 Tear off a large piece of foil and place it over the baking pan. Push down in the center, and then press the foil into the corners and up the sides of the pan. Be sure to leave a few inches of overhang on two sides of the pan.
 Allow your unsalted butter to soften at room temperature or, if you don’t want to wait, pop it in the microwave for a few seconds to soften it up. Use a pastry brush to cover the bottom and all four sides of the foil-lined pan with butter., Measure out ¾ cup of the condensed milk, reserving the rest. Place the milk in a medium-sized saucepan, then add the chocolate chips and a pinch of salt., Pour the remaining condensed milk into a separate medium-sized saucepan. Add the peanut butter chips and a pinch of salt to the pan., Arrange both saucepans on your stove, side-by-side, in a way that you can easily access both. Turn on low heat beneath both of them. Stir both mixtures occasionally as they melt.

Once they have both melted completely, remove them from heat.
Their consistencies should be smooth.
 Use a teaspoon to scoop up some of the chocolate mixture, then carefully drop it on the foil in the prepared baking pan. Continue to do this until you fill up the pan, taking care to leave gaps between each spoonful. Then spoon the peanut butter mixture into the gaps.

If you prefer, you can alternate spoonfuls of the chocolate and peanut butter rather than doing all of one, then all of the other.
 Cut the parchment paper to size and then brush it with unsalted butter, just as you did with the foil. Then place the parchment paper right on top of the fudge in the pan. Press down on the paper so that the surface is even and flat., This should take approximately 45 minutes. Once firm, take the pan out. Pull up on the two foil flaps that you left overhanging to remove the fudge from the pan. Cut the fudge into 1-inch squares and serve.

The fudge will keep for one week in an airtight container.

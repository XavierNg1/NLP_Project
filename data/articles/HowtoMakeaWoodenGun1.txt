 To build this toy gun, you will need a wooden 2x4 length of board, a saw, black tape, sandpaper, a drill and screws.;
, Start with a 2x4 piece of wood about 60 centimeter (23.6 in) long. Cut the board into two pieces, one 40 centimeter (15.7 in) and the other 20 centimeter (7.9 in) long. Place the longer board in a vice.
 Place the hole in the center of the plank about 9 centimeter (3.5 in) away from one end of the board.
 You should wrap tape around the board from the opposite end of the hole to just before you reach the hole. Make sure the hole is still exposed.
 Place the longer board over the smaller, making sure the hole is on top. The boards should be positioned to form a right angle. Just envision the longer board as the barrel and the shorter board as the stock of a gun.
 Using your drill, attach a small screw though the previously-drilled hole and into the shorter board underneath. Be sure the head of the screw is larger than the hole so it doesn't slip through.
 You can either sand the "stock" of the toy gun, wrap it with black tape or leave it as it is. Feel free to add further decoration with paint or markers. If your child likes playing cowboys or armies, this would be a great birthday or Christmas present.


You can make the gun a more realistic toy by adding a "trigger." Glue a wooden clothespin under the "barrel" of the toy gun, making sure that the shorter "clip" end is pointed outward. Later, your child can even stretch a rubber band from the clothes pin to the end of the gun's "barrel," releasing and "shooting" the rubber band by opening the clothespin "trigger."

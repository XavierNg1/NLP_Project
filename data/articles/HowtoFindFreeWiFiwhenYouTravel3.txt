 While not technically free wifi as it eats into your mobile data plan, if you need wifi in a place where other options can’t be found, you can generally tether your smartphone to other devices. This allows your phone to share its data so that you can get some form of internet access.If you do not have an unlimited data plan, tethering can start to add additional charges rather quickly. It is thus advisable to rely on tethering as a last resort unless you have an unlimited plan.
Some smartphones may also have a function that allows them to be turned into mobile hotspots, eliminating the need to physically connect your phone to the other device.
 Rugged locations often have lodges, base camps, or tourist offices that offer limited wifi access. It is generally enough to check email, though likely not enough to stream video. However, it can sometimes be the only option in more rural destinations.Employees at the office or lodge may be able to assist you in finding places such as internet cafes where you can purchase internet access affordably if the provided wifi does not suffice.
 If you are in an area that does not have many of the spots where one can typically find free wifi, one of the best things you can do is simply to ask. Kindly ask a local business owner or someone on a smart device, “Would you happen to know of any free wifi hotspots in the area?”Try to avoid asking others directly to use their private network unless it is an emergency. This may come off as rude or off-putting depending upon where you travel.

 Place 2 cups (500 ml) of boiling water, 1 cup (250 ml) freekeh, 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt, and 1/2 Tbsp (7.5 ml) olive oil in a deep, glass or plastic microwave-safe bowl.Mix slightly to moisten all the freekeh granules and to spread the salt and oil.
You can use either cracked grain freekeh or whole grain freekeh. Either option will work.
To boil the water, fill a tea kettle or small saucepan with water and heat it on the stove over high heat until bubbles start to form.
Alternatively, you can boil the water by placing it in a separate microwave-safe dish and microwaving it in 30 to 60 second intervals until bubbles start to form. Place wooden chopsticks in the water to break the surface tension as you microwave it, thereby preventing the water from super-heating and breaking the dish.;
, Cover the dish and cook the freekeh on high until most of the water is absorbed. For cracked grain freekeh, this will take 10 to 15 minutes. For whole grain freekeh, this will take 30 to 35 minutes.


If your microwave does not rotate, pause the microwave one to three times during the process to turn the dish manually. Doing so can ensure that the freekeh cooks evenly.
 After the cooking process finishes, remove the dish from the microwave and let the freekeh stand, undisturbed and still covered, for about 5 minutes.


The grains of freekeh should absorb the remaining water during this time, causing them to plump up and soften even more.
 At this point, the freekeh is ready to serve. You can enjoy it as is or use it in a recipe for another dish calling for pre-cooked freekeh.

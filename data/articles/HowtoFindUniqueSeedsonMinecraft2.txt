 This striking seed starts you near a set of villages built around (and on top of) a steep savannah cliff. With amazing visuals, decent loot, and lots of easily-fortifiable positions to explore, some internet commentators are calling this one of the best PE seeds of all time.Tip: Try exploring beneath the villages' wells to find dangerous strongholds full of surprises — including a well-hidden end portal.
 This frozen world has plenty of snow-capped forests, but the real attraction is the collection of massive ice spikes a short journey away from the spawn point. To get to the ice spikes, fly or walk past the low-ish hills to your right when you spawn. When you see what look like giant, upside-down icicles, you're in the right spot., This spawn starts you in a thick, deep jungle not far from a set of gorgeous beaches. Explore the jungle's darkest depths, using the ample supply of wood to get a head-start on building your base, or just chill out by the water — it's up to you!Tip: Directly beneath the spawn point is a mineshaft with coal and iron ore.
 Want to do some serious subterranean exploring right away? Try loading up this world and digging directly down below the spawn — you'll find a deep, expansive mineshaft. Whatever loot lies within the deepest depths of the underground complex is unknown. If you think you have what it takes to map out this vast cavern, you may be the first to find out!Tip: It's a good idea to mark the spawn point, then craft yourself a few basic tools, weapons, and torches before starting to explore.

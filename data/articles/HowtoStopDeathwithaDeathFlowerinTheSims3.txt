 At a graveyard, a certain type of flower grows. This is the Death Flower. There should be plenty to harvest. If there aren't any, go to a different graveyard, as there's bound to be some there.


If you still can't find any, press Ctrl+⇧ Shift+C and type testingcheatsenabled true, and then hit ↵ Enter. Press Ctrl+⇧ Shift+C again. Type buydebug and go to buy mode. Click "Sort by Function". You will see a question mark. Go to the "Gardening Plant and Seed Spawner" section. You will find a Death Flower plant which you can place on the lot.;
, Keep the flower in your Sim's inventory at all times. Don't remove it or you are prone to death. After you've used the death flower once, you can't use it again, so it's a good idea to keep multiple in your pocket and in your house.

, Irish soda bread is usually served in slices. Cut the bread into reasonable portions. For example, if you used a large circular pan to make your bread, you may need to cut the loaf in half before cutting slices. Otherwise, the pieces will be large and unwieldy.


Make sure each slice is about a quarter inch thick to avoid crumbling the bread.
 If you’re serving this bread with a meal, place the loaf on the table. Your diners can serve themselves as many pieces as they’d like. Serve the bread on a bread boat, a bread plate, or in a bread basket. Add a white linen doily to the basket to help keep the bread warm.Either slice the bread in advance or provide a bread knife so that guests can cut their own slices.
If your loaf is crumbly, give your guests small bread plates for their soda bread slices. This will help keep your table clean.
 After you and your guests have finished eating, store the bread in an airtight container. You can plastic wrap the bread onto a dish, place the bread in a re-sealable bag, or store it in a bread box. If you don’t store the bread in an airtight container it will quickly become stale.

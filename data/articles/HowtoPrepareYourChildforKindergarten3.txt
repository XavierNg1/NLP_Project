 Providing your child with healthy food is an essential component of learning effectively in school. Children who go to kindergarten hungry, or who don’t eat the essential food groups, are likely to have a harder time concentrating in class, which makes learning difficult.


Feed your child a well-balanced diet of whole grains, meat, fruits, vegetables, and dairy. Steer clear of foods with empty calories like candies or chips.
Give your child a healthy, filling breakfast the morning of her first day so that she can focus and have energy until lunch time.
 Give your child opportunities to play and engage in physical activities with other children or by herself. You can help your child to become strong by letting her do activities like:


Skipping, jumping, throwing and catching a ball with a playmate, dancing, swimming (with adult supervision), biking or scootering (also with adult supervision), and hiking.
 You child should have all of her immunizations before she goes off to kindergarten. Some private and public schools even require the child’s “baby booklet” to check which vaccinations your child has gotten. Vaccinations are important because they help your child to develop immunity against a variety of diseases like:


Polio, mumps, rubella (German measles), tuberculosis, HiB virus and diphtheria.
If your child is missing shots, contact your pediatrician right away.

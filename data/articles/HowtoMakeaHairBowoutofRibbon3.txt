 The classic bow is tied in a similar way you would tie your shoe laces. For this, you will need about five to six inches of ribbon and an elastic hair tie.
 Make sure that the ribbon is smooth and has equal lengths on both sides.
 To do this, lay the two pieces of ribbon on top of one another, and then slide the top piece over to the left, making them side by side. This will set you up for the knot.
 Move the right piece up, over, and under the left piece, so that you create a loop. You will then move the right piece into the loop, and pull tight into a knot.
 This is the first step to create the actually bow loops. Simply lay the end of each ribbon tail over your index fingers to fold the ends and create loops.
 Then take the left loop under the right loop and pull tight.
 Try to keep the bow loops flat while you make the knot. This will help keep the shape of the bow once it is tied.
 Each loop should be the same size. Once they are even, cut the ends so they are the same length. Your hair bow should now be tightly fastened to your hair elastic and ready to be worn.









To seal off the tail ends, use one coat of clear nail polish to keep it from unraveling.

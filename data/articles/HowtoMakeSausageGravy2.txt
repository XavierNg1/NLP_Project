 Adding some aromatics to your gravy ahead of time isn't typical, but it will add a new depth of flavor. The garlic, finely minced, will get a rich, toasted color and taste with a pinch of sharp garlicky spice, and the shallots will bring out a mouthwatering sweetness when browned.


The garlic and onion will absorb some of the grease, so add 1 tablespoon of butter as well to ensure you have enough liquid for the gravy.
 Most people love a simple, but delicious gravy made of only pepper, milk, and sausage, but you can really mix things up if you're feeling adventurous. In essence, this sauce is simply a white cream sauce with sausage, and can be spiced as if it were an Alfredo or savory cream sauce. Some ideas include:


Cracked red pepper
Cumin
Fresh Thyme and/or Rosemary
Fresh, finely chopped SageGarlic and/or Onion Powder, Remember that the base of all gravies is flour cooked in liquid fat. While you can use chicken or turkey sausage, you need to account for this lost fat when making gravy. Add 2-3 tablespoons of butter and melt it when the meat is almost finished cooking, then add the flour like normal.


Want a new flavor without going lean? Try some crumbled bacon along with the sausage!

, Remember that you'll need to keep some liquid fat in the pan, and that mushrooms tend to soak up liquid. Heat up 1 tablespoon butter and 1 of olive oil, cooking in that, and then add 2 tablespoons more butter once the mushrooms are soft and brown on the edges. Use this butter with 2-3 tablespoons flour to make your gravy., Looking for something completely new in your sausage gravy? Swap the breakfast sausage out for some Mexican chorizo and toss in a can of chipotle in adobo sauce or drained green chiles and cook like normal, until the sausage is browned. Then add 2 tablespoons of butter and whisk it in with the flour until you have a nice gravy base, proceeding like normal.

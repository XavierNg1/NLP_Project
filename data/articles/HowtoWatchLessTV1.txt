 At some point in recent history, it became popular to put televisions in every room of the house. But having access to TV everywhere you turn only leads to unnecessary viewing. Limit your TV watching to one room of your house to reduce temptation and ultimately watch less TV., Using a television recording device, like TiVo or DVR, can allow you to save the TV shows that you like. Having your favorite TV shows saved will reduce the time you spend aimlessly browsing and flipping channels, causing you to watch less TV., Keeping your TV in a cabinet (with a door that closes) or simply placing a tapestry over it when it is not in use can lead to a reduction in your TV time. When you can’t see the TV, you are much less likely to turn it on., Many people today are ditching their cable in favor of internet television services, like Netflix or Hulu. Once again, this practice eliminates the ability to mindlessly flip channels and leads to less time in front of the TV., If you make it more difficult for yourself to watch TV, it gives you a better opportunity to exercise some willpower. One way to achieve this is to unplug your TV when it’s not in use. Keeping your TV plugged in actually wastes quite a bit of energy, so pulling the plug is also a great choice for your pocketbook and the earth.

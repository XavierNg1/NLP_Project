 Click the link that says “Sign Up” in the top right corner.


Enter the information that the sign-up sheet requests and click the yellow “Create my account” button when you are ready.
 You can do this from your home page once you have an account.


Look for the small yellow button that says “Upload” and hover over it. It should be toward the top of the page in the middle. Click “Upload from your computer” from the drop-down menu that comes up.
Give your photo album a title and choose what kind of resolution you would like your photos to have.
Find a photo you would like to upload in the folders on your computer, and click “Open.” Once it is uploaded, Snapfish will give you a prompt asking if you would like to upload more photos or if you are done uploading. Click whichever one you need.
 Snapfish makes it easy!


As part of the upload process, Snapfish gives you the option to share the photo(s) via email. Simply type in the email address(es) to which you would like to send the photo(s). Then, type in a message and click the yellow “Share” button. However, you can skip this step by clicking the “Close” link in the top right corner of this pop-up window if you are not ready to share yet.
To share photos outside of the upload process, hover over the link that says “Share” with a down arrow next to it in the navigation bar. Then, click “Share photos & videos.” It will have you select which album you want to share, and then a pop-up window will appear. You can share the album directly via email, with a link, or on Facebook. Choose which option you would like to do, complete the boxes (if necessary), and click the yellow “Share album”/”Share to Facebook” button. If it is a link, you can just post the link where you would like to share it, such as on your website or in a Tweet.

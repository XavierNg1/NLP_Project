 At the very least, you should know a few terms and phrases, such as “hello,” “please,” “thank you,” “my name is…” “what is your name?” and “where is the bathroom?” The more you can understand and speak the language, the better.You can take an introductory language course, purchase language-learning software, or get a language translation book before your trip.
You can also try a language-learning app, like Duolingo, which is free and perfect for learning on-the-go.
 Find an English language newspaper online for the country you are traveling to, then start reading about current events a month or so in advance. Familiarize yourself with sensitive issues.You can also find out about special events that may be taking place while you are there.
 Do research online or buy a guidebook to help you navigate through these issues. Some countries may be more modest, while others have less restrictions.For example, men may get stares if they wear short pants, which may be acceptable only for children in some regions.
For instance, if you are going to a country where most women dress modestly, you may offend someone by wearing a tank top.
In other regions, shorts and no top at all might be normal at a beach or sun bathing location.
 It’s important to learn the rules of dress, touch, table manners, and speech before you go to a foreign country. Don't offend your host by hugging upon arrival if that is not acceptable. Likewise, be ready for a kiss upon first meeting where that is expected.In some countries it is offensive to touch someone's spouse or children, so keep that in mind.
It’s also important to mind your body language. Find out which hand, head, foot, or face gestures might be offensive or misinterpreted.
Keep your mind open when things seem shocking or taboo. Be a respectful observer of the local culture, but not a judge.

 A forward contract is like a futures contract or derivative. It is an agreement to buy or sell a currency at a fixed price on a certain date. Here's an example:


Dave is worried that the price of the dollar is going to plummet relative to the British pound. He has $1,000,000 in cash, which would fetch him about £600,000 at the then-current exchange rate. Dave wants to use a forward contract to lock in the exchange rate of the dollar relative to the pound. Here's what Dave does:
Dave offers to sell Vivian $1,000,000 of US currency in exchange for £600,000 of British currency in six months. Vivian accepts the deal. This is a "forward contract."

, Let's continue with our example of Dave offering a forward contract to Vivian. In six months (the agreed-upon time), there are three possible outcomes regarding the price of the dollar relative to the pound. Each of these possibilities affects the forward contract:


The price of the dollar goes up relative to the pound. Hypothetically, let's say one dollar now fetches .75 pound instead of .6 pound. Dave pays Vivian the difference between the current price of exchange and the price agreed upon in the contract: ($1,000,000 x .75) - ($1,000,000 x .6) = $150,000.
The price of the dollar goes down relative to the pound. Hypothetically, let's say one dollar now fetches .45 pound instead of .6 pound. Vivian agreed to pay Dave .6 pound for each of his dollars six months ago, so Vivian has to pay Dave the difference between the price agreed upon in the contract and the current price: ($1,000,000 x .6) - ($1,000,000 x .45) = $150,000.
The exchange rate between the dollar and the pound stays the same. No exchange happens between partners in the contract.
 Like any derivative, a forward contract is a great way to ensure you don't lose a lot of money if a currency you have a sizable position in drops in value. Here's how Dave came out by using a forward contract:


If the dollar gained in value, Dave is a winner, although he still has to pay out. If one dollar fetches .75 pound instead of .6, Dave has to pay Vivian $150,000, but his million dollars suddenly buys a lot more pounds.
If the dollar fell in value, Dave isn't a loser. Remember, Vivian owes him the exchange rate they agreed upon at the beginning of the contract. So it's as if the value of the dollar never fell. Dave takes the payout, none the poorer than he was before.

 Try to donate to charities to help out poor victims in France - find a charity that you can trust and helps out as much as possible. One choice can be the French Red Cross. Several other charities could currently be operating however, so you can choose whichever one you would like to. Try to donate as much as you can to help those who have lost a lot and need more help.
 This may only be able to be done in France, but it can be a huge help to any injured victims, as the attack left over hundreds of people wounded. Find a local blood drive and be prepared to donate some. Be sure you are healthy enough to do it, as giving too much blood can be unhealthy for you.
 Help these organizations to collect as much as possible to help the victims - they might be thankful for having some extra helpers too. You can also help out in money charities and other reasons to collect enough to give to the injured.
 There is a French website that is specially for reporting missing people. You will need to know a list of several French victims however, then report them to the website so that people can try to find them and bring them back.

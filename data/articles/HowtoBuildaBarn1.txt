 These will determine what kind of barn you can or can't build and provide a starting point for planning your barn.;
, Ideally, you want to build a barn on a site with enough slope for water to drain away, but not so much slope that it takes soil with it.
 Spend time at your prospective site studying the wind patterns to find which way the wind usually blows the strongest from. Once you determine the prevailing direction, plan the barn layout to be at a 45 degree angle to this direction so that you'll have excellent air circulation without turning the barn's center aisle into a wind tunnel.


If the wind blows equally strong from all 4 directions an equal amount of the time, consider building a barn in a square layout with an entrance on each side. You can then open and close entryways as needed to provide adequate ventilation.

 Wash everything with soap and water. Next, dry everything off with paper towels. If your tools are dirty, you risk contaminating your eyeshadow. This can lead to serious infections.
 You can use just about anything, so long as it is small enough and has a tight fitting lid. The jar should be able to hold ½ to 1 teaspoon of fluid. You don't want the jar to be so large that the eyeshadow sits at the bottom in a small lump.


Contact cases make great eyeshadow containers.
You can also use tiny jars meant for storing paint. You can get them at art supply stores.
You can also buy makeup containers online and in beauty supply shops.
 You will need enough to fill ¼ teaspoon. You can use all one color. You can also use multiple colors to create your own shade. If you can't find an eye shadow color you like, use cosmetic pigment powder. You can find it online or in beauty supply shops.
 Make sure that there are no clumps or chunks. If there are any, your eyeshadow will be too clumpy at the end.
 Add just enough so that the eyeshadow is suspended in it. If you can, try to use 91% rubbing alcohol.
 Keep adding and stirring the oil until you get a nice, creamy texture. You can also use argan, jojoba, or sweet almond oil instead.
 It will look lumpy. This is just the excess rubbing alcohol rising to the top.
 This will give the excess rubbing alcohol enough time to float to the top. The rest of the rubbing alcohol will have bound the oil and eyeshadow together.
 Fold the tissue into a square and dip a corner into the mixture. Once it soaks up some of the alcohol, rotate the square and dip another corner. Keep doing this until all of the excess alcohol is gone. If needed, use a fresh tissue if your old one gets too dirty.
 It may look grainy once it is set, but it will go on smoothly. Once it is set, you can put the lid back on to the jar.

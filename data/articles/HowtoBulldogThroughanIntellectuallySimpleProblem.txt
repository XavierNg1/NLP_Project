 Edit Go to cell range A3:A2882 and with A3 as the active cell, enter the formula w/o quotes "=((A2+(-Tip*2)/(AdjRows)))" and Edit Fill Down, Edit Go To cell range B2:B2882 and with B2 the active cell enter w/o quotes the formula "=Base*24/Spheroids" and Edit Fill Down. Select cell C2 and Format Cells Border Black thick Outline and Fill Yellow -- this is the crux of the problem. Edit Go To cell range C3:C2882 and with C3 the active cell enter w/o quotes the formula, "=C2-1" and Edit Fill Down. Enter into cell C2 your best Initial Guess at the number of degrees to start calculating the Cosine and Sine formulas from in order to be able to have the chart move from left to right instead of right to left, and from 90 degrees through 0 degrees instead of vice versa. My Initial Guess was 90 degrees. In creating the chart (in a few steps), I noticed larger guesses like 180, 360, 450 and 540 were moving the arc leftwards the way ti should go, but the method was error prone and unscientific, even if it did eventually hit on the correct answer by chance. No, bulldogging one's way through life is not preferable; finesse is optimal and saves oodles of time.
 Edit Go To cell range E2:E2882 and w/o quotes enter formula "=Radius*SIN(C2*PI()/180*0.125)" and Edit Fill Down. Edit Go To cell range F2:F2882 and w/o quotes enter formula "=((SIN(A2/(B2*2))*GM*COS(A2)*GM*(COS(A2/(B2*2)))*GM)+D2)" and Edit Fill Down. Edit Go To cell range G2:G2882 and w/o quotes enter formula "=((SIN(A2/(B2*2))*GM*SIN(A2)*GM*(COS(A2/(B2*2)))*GM)+E2)" and Edit Fill Down.
 Edit Go To cell range F2:G722. If you're using Chart Wizard, basically follow these same steps except that a new Chart Page will be created for you, which you many re-title. Select Charts from the menu, All or Other, and scroll down to select Scattered Smoothed Line Scattered and copy of cut the resultant chart and paste onto The LR Chart worksheet into cell A1. Hover over the lower right corner until the cursor changes to the double-headed arrow and then click on the corner of the chart and pull it open into a large square. The result should be approximately a quarter-circle of 16 spheres which do NOT start at 0 degrees and proceed to 0 degrees -- OOPS! That is, unless your Initial Guess was excellent and well thought out.
 There is only one cycle being made around the ring because of the 0.125 factor used in the formula for Cosine (and Sine), of "=Radius*COS(C2*PI()/180*0.125)", because 2880 * .128 = 360 (degrees). 90 degrees does not work. Neither did 360 +90=450 or 540 when I was "Fooling around" guessing at the answer instead of thinking. It's simple, really: 720 degrees is not only a quarter circle but it is 8 times 90 degrees! And the problem is very easy when described as the comparison of the ratios 90/360 - x/2880, which soon becomes 2880 = 4x or x = 720. 720 is the correct answer, even though it just seems wrong, being twice 360. Or, another way to think of it is that 0.125*720 = 90, or 1/4 of 0.125*2880. 8 of those are needed because 2880 is 8 times 360. So, 8*90 = 720. Think of 2880 as the level of detail obtained per spheroid; 2880/64 = 45 data points per spheroid. You may wish to double-click on the series plot line and decrease the Line Weight to 1 or do it via Chart Layout in the upper left hand corner where it says Format Selection.
 It plainly starts and ends at {0,2}, which is exactly what is wanted, and proceeds from left to right, Problem solved!

 Once potential adopters begin contacting you, you will want to get some background information. Ask them to send you proof of employment, living situation and veterinarian. Have the potential adopters send you photocopies of documents like a pay stub and their lease. They should also forward you their veterinarian’s contact information.You might say something like “would you mind sending me a copy of a pay stub from your work?” or “would you share your veterinarian’s contact info with me?”

, You may want to meet any potential adopters in person. This will help you get a better feel for the people interested in adopting your dog. Go over some of the information you had the potential adopter send you, such as their work life and veterinary situation. You should also ask about their living and work situation, who will be the dog’s primary caregiver and if the dog has access to a yard or park.You might ask “what happened to your previous pets?” and “are all of your animals spayed and neutered?”
Ask them things like “how many pets do you currently own?” and “do you have any experience with shy dogs?”
During the interview you might ask “how many hours a week do you work?” or “do you live in an apartment or a house?”
Some other questions to ask are “how often will the dog be outside?” and “do you have any children?”

, If you conduct the interview in person, you should also allow the potential adopter to meet your dog. Observe how they interact with the animal and how your dog responds to them. Although your dog is shy and is generally timid, if they act particularly fearful around this person, they are probably not a good fit. Trust your dog’s instincts when vetting any potential adopters.

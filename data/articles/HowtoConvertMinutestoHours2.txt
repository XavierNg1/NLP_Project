 You can do this a few different ways. For example, if you're working on paper, you might write down the number of minutes and label it with the word "minutes." If you're using a calculator, just type in the number.


As an example, let's say that we want to find out how many hours a 150 minute movie will be. In this case, we'll start by writing down 150 minutes. In the next few steps, we'll solve!

, Next, write (or type) a multiplication sign (×), then the fraction 1 hour/60 minutes. This fraction shows how many minutes are in an hour (60). When we multiply, we'll end up with the correct units, too (since the two "minutes") cancel out.


This is the same as dividing by 60/1, or 60. If you need help dividing and multiplying fractions, see WikiHow's help article on this topic.
 Now you just need to do the math. The answer you get will be the number of hours you're looking for.


In our example, 150 minutes × 1 hour/60 minutes = 2.5 hours, or 2 1/2 hours. This is the same as 150 divided by 60 or 150/60.
 Taking an hours measurement and multiplying it by 60 will get you minutes again. Technically, you're multiplying by 60 minutes/1 hour so that the two "hours" cancel properly.


In our example, multiplying 2.5 hours × 60 minutes/1 hour = 150 minutes — exactly what we started with.
 Sometimes, time measurements are given like this: x hours y minutes. In this case, you can just convert the "y minutes" portion to hours, then add it to the "x hours" portion. This gives you the total time in (just) hours.


For example, let's say that we need to convert 3 hours and 9 minutes to just hours. To do this, all we need to do is figure out how many hours 9 minutes is, then add it to 3 hours. In other words, 9 minutes × 1 hour/60 minutes = 0.15 hours + 3 hours = 3.15 hours.

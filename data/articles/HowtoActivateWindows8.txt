 Most Windows 8 systems that you purchase from a retailer have already been activated and don't require any input from you. You can double-check if Windows has been activated by opening the System window (⊞ Win+Pause). Your activation status will be displayed at the bottom.;
, In order to activate Windows, you will need a valid Product Key. You can buy a key directly from Microsoft by clicking the "Get more features with a new edition of Windows" link in the System window. If your copy of Windows came in a case, the Product Key will be on a sticker affixed to that case.


Some computers will have the Product Key sticker on the back or bottom.
You can also purchase product keys from the Microsoft website.
A Product Key is a 25-character key separated into five groups of five characters each.
 Once you have obtained or found your valid key, you can send it to the Microsoft servers in order to verify your installation. To do this, open the "Enter new key" window.


Open the Command Prompt. Press ⊞ Win+X and select Command Prompt from the menu.
Type slui 3 and press ↵ Enter.
 Type your Product Key into the box. Windows will automatically detect if the key is valid and then start the online activation. If activation encounters any errors, you will be given a phone number you can call to activate.


The activation window will not allow you to enter in characters that aren't normally found in the Product Key.

 Introverts are often better at one-on-one interactions than talking to people in groups. This can come in handy if you're trying to network with a particular person in your field. Strive to catch people when they're alone and not involved in a group conversation. A one-on-one conversation will be less stressful for you and can help you foster a stronger bond., People love talking about themselves and tend to be drawn to good listeners. As introverts are naturally good listeners, use your listening skills when networking. Ask the other person a lot of questions and show you're listening by nodding, maintaining eye contact, and smiling when appropriate.However, make sure you don't only listen. It's important you showcase your skill set as well. If the person asks you anything about yourself, respond accordingly. Don't be afraid to talk up your skills a little.
 Don't think of your introverted nature as a hindrance during networking. It can actually benefit you. Introverts tend to form close relationships with a few people, so take advantage of your ability to develop strong relationships via networking. Strive for quality over quantity when it comes to connections.For example, if you feel a strong connection to someone at an event, talk to that person for a longer period. Follow up with them later and meet up for a one-on-one interaction. A solid relationship with someone in your field can lead to connections down the road.
 One advantage of being an introvert is that it can help you empathize during events. Remember, many other people in the crowd are also introverted. They are likely as nervous as you are. Thinking about this can make it easier to approach people, as you'll know they're likely intimidated as well. It helps the playing field feel more even.

, You don't want them to be huge, but make sure they're not tiny at the same time. This will be the bunny's fur so make sure you have enough!

, Make sure the whole plate is covered with the makeshift fur. Don't make the fur too thick otherwise you won't be able to add the rest of the facial features. Think of it as just a coating.
 Simply add a touch of glue to the back of the eyes and stick them onto the face.
 Like the eyes, just sick on a jewel button. Now your bunny can smell you!

, This is where you can get creative. Use the pipe cleaners to make all different shape, colour and size whiskers. Will they be curled at the ends or straight all the way across? Really, it's all up to you!

, If you like, you could hole punch a hole in the top of the paper plate and hang it up somewhere. Before you do this, make sure the glue is completely dry so nothing falls off.

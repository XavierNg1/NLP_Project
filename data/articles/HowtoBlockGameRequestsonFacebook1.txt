, On the left side of the screen, you will see a tab labeled "Blocking". Click it to open the blocking tools.
 Enter the name of the person who keeps sending you game requests. As you type a name, a list of potential matches will appear. Click the name and that person will be added to the block list.


Adding a person’s name to this section will only block the app requests from that person; it will not block him/her entirely.
You can add as many names to this list as you'd like.

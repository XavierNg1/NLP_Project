 One way to make sure you are inserting your tampon correctly is to make sure you understand how the tampon goes into your vagina. You may be able to feel around and stick the tampon inside, but you may not completely understand the mechanics. When you start using tampons, or if you have never looked at how they work, take the time to look at your genital area to get a better picture of what goes on when you use a tampon.Get a mirror and look at your vagina so you have a good idea of the anatomy, where the tampon goes, and how it gets inserted before you start to insert a tampon.;
, Tampons come with different kinds of applicators. You can get plastic applicators, cardboard applicators, or tampons without any applicator at all. You should try to figure out which is the best for you. For most women, a plastic applicator is easier to insert than others.A plastic applicator has a slicker surface that may be easier to slide into the vagina. A tampon with a cardboard applicator or without any applicator may not slide as easily and get stuck or stop before it is completely inserted.
 Because a woman’s flow varies greatly, tampons come in different sizes and absorbencies. When choosing a tampon, you may want to go for a smaller tampon, especially if you are experiencing pain or having trouble inserting it properly. Try light or regular size tampons.Each box explains the difference between the different tampon sizes. Light tampons are the smallest and most slender. They don’t absorb much blood, so if you are bleeding heavier, you may have to change your tampon more often. A regular tampon may also be a good option because it is still more slender but holds more menstrual blood.
Super and super plus tampons may be too large to be comfortable. They are larger around because they are designed to hold blood from heavier flows.
Make sure to use the absorbency that corresponds to your flow. Don’t use a larger tampon made for a heavier flow if you don’t need it.

 Free time can be soaked up quickly if you look for a few things around your office to do. One that most people happily put off is organizing your desk. Clean out the drawers, throw away any trash or unwanted files/notes, and put things in an orderly fashion., Just like your desk, your email inbox can quickly get cluttered. Use your downtime at work to clear out your inbox, set filters to organize your emails, and respond to any lingering messages. If you have multiple email accounts, you can even work on linking them together to help keep them organized., Whether your files are electronic or hard copy, they need to be organized. When youâ€™re not busy you can put hard copy files into filing cabinets (in an organized way). You can also clean up the files on your computer and get them into the right folders.

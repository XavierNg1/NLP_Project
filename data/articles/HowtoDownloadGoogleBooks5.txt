 This is a free program that allows you to enter a URL for a Google Books file and then download the available pages to your computer.


You can download the Google Books Downloader from googlebookdownloader.codeplex.com/releases/view/125464.
 Open the preview in the Google Books search reader and then copy the URL. Remember that this tool will only download the pages that you can view in the Google Books website reader.
 Select your output format if you want something other than PDF.


You can also select where you want the book to be saved. By default, it will be saved to your desktop.
 This may take a little while if there are a lot of pages.

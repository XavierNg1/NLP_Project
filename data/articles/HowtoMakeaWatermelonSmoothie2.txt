 You can do this by cutting the watermelon into cubes and removing the rind. You can also simply cut a watermelon in half, and then scoop the flesh out with a melon scoop or coffee scoop.
 You can use regular cow's milk or another type of milk, such as almond, coconut, or soy., If the watermelon is already very sweet, or if you just don't have a sweet tooth, you can omit the nectar or honey., The more ice you add, the thicker the smoothie will become. If you don't want smoothie to get watered down, use ice cubes made from frozen milk instead of frozen water., The ice should be all broken up and the ingredients evenly mixed together. If the smoothie is not blending evenly, pause the blender, and use a rubber spatula to scrape any unblended smoothie down the sides and towards the bottom of the blender., You can drink it as is, or garnish it with a swirl of agave nectar or honey. You can also add a small watermelon wedge to the edge of each glass for a fancier touch instead.

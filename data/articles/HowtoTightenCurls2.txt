 Start working on getting tight curls before the styling even begins by using curl-enhancing hair products in the shower. Do some scrunching as you apply the shampoo and conditioner to enhance and encourage even tighter curls. Rinse your hair thoroughly, since any leftover residue will weigh your curls down.
 Don’t skimp on this key product. Curl creams help tame frizz, create texture and define spiral curls. Curl creams also keep your hair soft, while many other styling products may result in “crunchy” curls. Look for curl cream products that create a tight, intense curl; avoid the creams marketed for wavy hair.


Some creams claim to be root stimulators, which can also help you take your curls to the next level., Curl-defining creams and pomades are applied to dry, just-styled hair. They help separate your ringlets while also fighting frizzing and adding a bit of texture. Put a pea-sized amount on your fingertips, then rub your fingertips together so that you can work with both hands. Gently apply to small sections of hair with your fingers, lightly squeezing and scrunching your ringlets to encourage separation and definition.


A small amount of styling gel can be applied in the same way to get a similar result with a stronger hold.
 When your curls start to lose their bounce, spray one of these products onto dry hair, then fluff and scrunch it. The product will reactivate your curls and restore bounce and shine to your locks. Look for lightweight sprays and mists.

 Obesity has become a major issue in todayâ€™s world. Not only does it lead to an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes, but the excessive weight that an obese person has will ultimately take its toll on the feet and knee joints. This will lead to your feet getting sore easily.
 As mentioned above, excessive weight during pregnancy will add stress to your feet and make them sore. Hence, getting plenty of rest and putting your feet up as much as possible is important for pregnant women.
 Sometimes, by birth, people may develop abnormalities in the shape or form of the feet, such as flat feet, excessively high arched feet, and arthritis.


Normally, our feet have an arch which helps maintain and spread out stress and pressure across the toes and feet in a well-distributed manner. However, in some patients, there might be no arch (flat foot) or an arch that is too high.
Due to a disturbance in this balance, more stress is placed on the feet, causing them to become sore.
 If your footwear does not have proper padding, or if they disturb the ordinary balance of your feet (like in the case of high heels), this can make your feet become very sore quite easily.


Additionally, shoes that are too tight or too big for you will lead to soreness too as yet again, there is a high chance of pressure against the foot (in case of tight shoes) or a disturbance in balance

, Prolonged periods of standing, or any activity such as running, jogging, cycling etc. will lead to fatigue of the muscles within your feet, causing soreness.

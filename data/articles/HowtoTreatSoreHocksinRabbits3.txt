 Long nails can curve under a rabbit’s foot and damage the skin, causing sore hocks. If your rabbit has long nails, trim them during the course of treatment. Following treatment, keep them short as a way to prevent another case of sore hocks. If you are not comfortable trimming your rabbit’s nails, have your vet do so.


If you do decide to trim your rabbit’s nails on your own, be sure not to trim past the quick of the nails.The quick is the blood vessel that runs through the middle of each nail. Trimming past the quick would be very painful for your rabbit and cause bleeding.
 Usually, an overweight rabbit cannot stand properly, causing it to put unnatural and uneven pressure on its feet. This pressure can cause sore hocks.If your rabbit is overweight or obese, you will need to gradually lower its weight to decrease the pressure on its feet. This will involve feeding your rabbit a healthy diet and increasing its exercise.


Talk with your vet before starting your rabbit on a weight loss program. Your vet will let you know how much weight your rabbit should lose and help you devise an effective weight loss plan.
Exercise options for your rabbit including digging, chasing you, and running through an obstacle course. Be mindful that, at the start of treatment, your rabbit’s feet may hurt too much for exercise.
A healthy diet for your rabbit includes hay, fresh vegetables, and limited amounts of pellets and treats.
 A rabbit with arthritis or other skeletal problems will have a hard time maintaining correct posture, increasing the likelihood of sore hocks.If your rabbit has orthopedic problems along with sore hocks, your vet will treat your rabbit for those other problems as well.


You can make your rabbit's cage more comfortable by using a litter box with a low front and shallow food and water bowls.

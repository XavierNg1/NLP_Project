, When you washing your face, make sure you use a product that is gentle for your skin to clean your skin. When buying the right cleanser, look for one labeled as “non-comedogenic.” This means that the product doesn’t promote the formation of oils or blemishes, including blackheads, whiteheads, or pimples.


Also look for alcohol-free products when buying the right cleanser. Alcohol does help dry and remove oils, but it can also damages your skin.Look for products such as those from Cetaphil, Neutrogena, and Olay. There are also numerous store-brand products that are non-comedogenic. Just read the product labels to be sure., When you wash your face, use your fingertips to massage the cleanser and moisturizer into your skin. Using a washcloth or sponge may irritate your skin and cause more problems for your skin.


If you decide to use a gentle cloth, do not scrub your face. This may damage the delicate skin of your face, especially around your eyes.
 Skin exfoliation is a popular way to cleanse your skin, but it can actually cause extra oil production in your skin. By removing the natural secretions and oils from your skin, your face may actually produce even more of them in order to provide the natural protection for your skin.


The exfoliation process can also pull off parts of your skin that are not ready to fall off yet.Chemical exfoliants, such as Salicylic acid or Alpha hydroxy acid, remove dry skin and oils from your skin. However, these can cause excess drying of your skin and cause irritation. If you have issues when using these products, ask your dermatologist for a better exfoliant.

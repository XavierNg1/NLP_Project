 Aloe vera has long been known to rejuvenate the skin and clear up infections. When your child has chickenpox blisters, aloe vera can help to keep the blisters from becoming infected, while also speeding up the healing process. It also helps to speed up your child’s skin cell growth, which means that she is less likely to have chickenpox scars.To apply aloe vera gel:


Wash your hands with warm water and soap. Use a finger to apply a pea-sized drop of aloe vera gel on each of the blisters.
 Sandalwood oil has anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties that help to constrict your child’s skin pores, which can help relieve irritation while also speeding up the healing of the blisters. To use sandalwood oil:


Soak a cotton ball in the oil. Gently apply it directly to each of the blisters.
 Vitamin E oil is an antioxidant that promotes skin health. When applied to your child’s skin, it will help to fight bacteria that could make the blisters become infected. It can also help to heal the blisters faster and will keep marks from forming once the blisters are gone. To use vitamin E oil:


Rub it on each of your child’s blisters once a day.
 The acidic content in vinegar helps to destroy harmful bacteria. You can run a warm bath for your child and then add ½ cup of brown vinegar to speed up the healing process of the blisters and keep them from becoming infected.
 Like many of the other natural products listed in this section, tea tree oil fights bacteria.

Mix about 50 ml of a base oil (jojoba oil, coconut oil, or olive oil) with 15 drops of tea tree oil.
Soak a cotton ball in the mixture and apply it to each individual blister.

 While English muffins are a good size for an Egg McMuffin sandwich, you could use another small bread. Split a biscuit in half and replace the muffin. Or toast a few slices of your favorite bread to use. You could also use:


Mini pita bread
Croissants
Small bagels

, Use a different breakfast meat on the sandwich for a little variety. Cook some turkey sausage, pork sausage or bacon in the pan that you use to saute the egg. Set the cooked meat on top of the bottom half of the English muffin or bread.


For a vegetarian version, just leave the meat out.
 Changing the cheese is one of the easiest ways to make the biggest difference in flavor. Instead of using American cheese, add a slice of your favorite cheese. You could use crumbled soft cheeses (like blue cheese, goat cheese, or feta). Or you could add a slice of one of these firmer cheeses:


Cheddar
Jack
Swiss
Gouda

, Although a traditional Egg McMuffin doesn't have any vegetables, you can easily add some. Just slice your favorite vegetables and add them to the sandwich or saute them for a few minutes before placing them on top of the egg. You could add:Sauteed mushrooms
Sliced tomato
Sauteed bell peppers
Sauteed onions
Fresh sprouts

, To add a really unique flavor, squirt a condiment onto the English muffin before you assemble the sandwich. For a spicy sandwich, add a little sriracha sauce. Or for a typical sandwich, spread a little mayonnaise and mustard. You could also add:


Ketchup
Horseradish sauce
Harissa
Relish

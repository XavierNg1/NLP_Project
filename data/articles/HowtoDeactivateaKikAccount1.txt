 Deleting a Kik account is quite easy once you know how to do it. Begin by visiting the official Kik account deactivation page at ws.kik.com/deactivate. Here, you should see a small white box with a farewell message against a grey background.


Note that you can also access the deactivation page from the Kik help site.;
, On the account deactivation page, type your Kik email address into the text box onscreen. This is the email address you supplied when you first created your Kik account. Click "Go!" to continue.


If you've forgotten the email address associated with your Kik account, you can find it by opening the Kik app, tapping the gear icon in the top right to take you to the Settings menu, then tapping "Your Account." On this screen, you'll see your name, username, and email., An email from Kik should automatically be sent to your inbox when you click "Go!" Open this email and click the confirmation link at the bottom under "Want to deactivate your account?" This will deactivate your Kik account.


You may not see the deactivation email immediately â€” it can take several minutes to arrive.
Note that your account deactivation email will prominently feature messages from your Kik contacts in an effort to get you to stay on Kik. If you're serious about deactivating your account, just ignore them, scroll to the bottom, and click the deactivation link.

Use a vertical rectangle for the torso and a horizontal rectangle for the lower body. Use straight lines for the hands/legs (with circles for joints), triangles for hands, and rectangles for feet.

Sketch the face and hair. Make ruffled bangs and ruffled long hair (follow the tutorial's illustration). Pay close attention to the individual strands, and try to mimic the way they fall around the shoulders in this illustration.
 Add details like toes, belt, decorative cord on the right shoulder, and tassels on the costume.
 Color Hakudoshi if you so desire.

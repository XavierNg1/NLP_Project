 During the last stages of your pregnancy, a variety of exercises can be used to prevent back labor from occurring.


Try doing pelvic tilts. This is where you get on your hand and knees, curl up your back, and then straighten it out. It helps loosen ligaments and relieves back pain some experience during pregnancy. It can also help position the fetus to prevent back labor.Invest in a birth ball and spend a little time each day sitting on the ball and doing light exercises with it. You can sit on the ball and rock your pelvis from side to side , rotate your hips from side to side, or lean over the ball in a kneeling position and rock your hips.Wait until you are at 35â€“36 weeks to try this.
 How you sit in the months leading up to labor can have an effect on the position of your baby. Try to sit in a position that prevents your knees from being lower than your hips and avoid sitting too deeply in couches and recliners., When labor begins, try move around as much as possible. This can keep the baby from getting into a position that would lead to back labor.


Try to avoid lying on your back too much during the course of your pregnancy. This can reduce your risk of back labor when you go into labor. During labor itself, try to sit up as much as possible. If you need to lie down, try to lie on your side.Walk around the hospital during the early stages of labor and do some pelvic tilts.Try sitting backward on a chair or toilet when you need to sit.

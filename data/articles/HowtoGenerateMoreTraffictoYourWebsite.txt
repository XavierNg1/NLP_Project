One major problem faced by online companies is that the products they are selling is not needed by people.

 There are, of course, several on the net. Write a short ad or article there about your niche or service and put your link under it.

If the article is too long people won't bother to read it all and they will not see the URL(s) at the bottom in the author box. It's important to follow their guidelines, because all articles will be reviewed. In most cases articles will be distributed over other partner websites as well and sometimes articles will be printed in some paper magazines (if it's really good and quality content). Posting unique content in an absolute must. They will check if a similar article or ad has already been posted on their website(s). It's possible (not recommendable) to use existing material, but you will need to change it so that it will look completely different.

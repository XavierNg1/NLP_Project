 Gather parsley before the first flowers start to open, and gather it in the morning after the dew has dried. It will have maximum flavor at this time of day; the heat of the afternoon will diminish the parsley's flavor. Alternately, purchase fresh parsley at a grocery store. Choose bright green bunches of parsley that look nice and smell fresh. Don't pick parsley that is shriveled, brown, moldy, or is dried out. Carefully cut the parsley with stems still attached, and be careful to not bruise the leaves.
 Use cold water to rinse, and then shake the parsley gently to remove excess water from the leaves. This will remove any residual dirt, as well as any bugs that crawled into your parsley.
 Wrap a paper bag around each bundle of parsley to keep dust and sunshine from the parsley while it is drying. Sunshine can diminish the drying parsleyâ€™s bright green color. If you wrap the bundles with paper bags, be sure to allow enough air flow around each bundle so that they do not mold. Check each bundle occasionally to ensure there is no mold growth.
 Indoor drying will typically produce more flavorful dried herbs. This process may take a week or two to produce fully dried parsley. If you hang the bundles outdoors, be sure to choose a spot that is protected from moisture, animals and birds. Tie the bundles securely so that they do not blow away.
 When leaves are crumbly, they are ready to put into an airtight container and stored in a cool, dry place.

 The paint in a sprayer will harden if it's not dealt with promptly. It's a good idea to clean out your sprayer after every use. Remove the nozzle from the sprayer and clear the paint out of the nozzle with a damp paper towel. Dry out the nozzle afterwards to make sure the moisture doesn't affect the next load of spray paint.


Don't leave the sprayer idle for more than 20 minutes. If you do, the paint will begin to harden., If there's a micro-fracture somewhere in the hose, it will shoot out paint and lower the effective pressure of the device. This is best done by feeling out the hose as well as looking for visible breaks.
 If it's punctured or at least 20% clogged, your filter is a good candidate for replacement. Many airless sprayers come with a couple of replacement filters, but you can purchase them fairly inexpensively wherever you got the sprayer from.
 Airless paint sprayers operate at very high pressures and can very easily cause injuries if you spray directly onto your skin. You may actually inject paint into your tissues or bloodstream without having an obvious cut or bleeding. The skin can open up and allow the passage of the paint through and then close off again making it appear that nothing is wrong. This is a "fluid injection injury", and should be treated by a professional immediately.

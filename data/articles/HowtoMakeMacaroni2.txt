 Use store-bought or homemade dough to create the macaroni noodles. Mold the dough into a long, thick log-shape. Use the palms of your hands to gently press on the sides of the dough to create an oblong shape., Use a paring knife to slice the dough. Cut the dough into 1 inch thick (2.54 cm) chunks., Lie the slice of pasta dough onto a cutting board. Using your paring knife, slice the dough into three vertical sections. From there, cut each section into 1-inch squares (2.54 cm).Continue this process until you have sliced all of the dough into squares., Take two squares of the pasta dough and lie them on a flat, clean surface. Roll a stainless steel skewer or a wooden rod in some flour. Place the stick or skewer on top of the squares of dough.You can buy a skewer or rod at a kitchen supplies store or online., Gently press the rod into the dough and begin to roll back and forth. The dough will begin to wrap around the rod, creating a tube shape. Once it has completely wrapped around the rod, tilt the rod upward and gently remove the noodles.Continue rolling the remaining pasta squares., Once you have removed the macaroni, place them on a flat tray, clean cutting board, or dinner plate. Be sure to spread the noodles apart., Once the noodles have been formed, you can choose to keep the longer tubes or you can slice them with a paring knife to create shorter, more traditional macaroni noodles. Cut each macaroni tube into 1 inch (2.54 cm) pieces to create shorter noodles., If you do not wish to cook all of the macaroni at that time, place the noodles in a freezer bag and seal it tightly. Homemade pasta can be stored in the freezer for two to three months., To cook the fresh macaroni noodles, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Once the water is boiling, add the pasta and cook for 4 to 5 minutes.If you are cooking homemade macaroni noodles that have been frozen, allow the noodles to boil in the water for an extra minute.

 Short hopping allows you to land aerials very quickly from the ground. Some examples are short hopping into a Ganondorf or Falco dair.


Short hopping, how do you do it? Short hopping is achieved by quickly tapping the X or Y button or by quickly pushing the analog stick up. You'll know if you're short hopping if you're jumping significantly "shorter" then you normally do.
 Dash dancing is done by quickly moving your analog stick left and right repeatedly very quickly. When you should dash dance is dependent on how often you are "standing". Throughout a match, when you are just standing idly, you should dash dance as you can do many things out of a dash dance such as grabbing, jumping, and etc. Plus it intimidates your opponent.
 L-Canceling reduces the amount of lag you receive after performing an aerial and landing on the ground.


If you want to L-Cancel, after performing an aerial, simply press any shield button right before you hit the ground.
 Wavedashing is a technique used to allow players to perform ground moves while moving horizontally on the ground.


This is achieved by short hopping and then immediately air dodging diagonally into the ground.

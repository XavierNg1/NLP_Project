 You can do this with materials such as frosting, glue, or hair conditioner. The amount you set out should be the total amount of pink coloring you wish to make. Put it in a mixing bowl so you’ll have adequate space to work in the dye.
 Red is a common coloring and can be mixed in to turn the white substance pink. The problem with red food coloring is that it is very strong, so start with a drop first and add more later if you need to make the shade deeper. Larger amounts of frosting or other material require more drops.








You can also use alternative colors such as rose. These lighter food colorings can give a better pink color to your frosting.
 Use a wooden spoon or substitute kitchen implement to mix in the food coloring. Turn over the frosting or other material until you’re sure that the coloring has been absorbed and spread, then add more red coloring as needed.
 To tame your mixture into the tint of pink you desire, try adding drops of food coloring other than red. Experiment with it. Work slowly, a drop at a time.








Using a food coloring such as blue, violet, green, or even brown will darken your pink, making it into a hot pink and then a fuchsia or magenta.
Add a lighter color such as yellow to make your pink into peach.

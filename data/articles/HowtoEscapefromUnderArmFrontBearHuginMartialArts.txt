 If you tense up your stomach, even a little, it won't hurt as bad. You should be tense enough so that you can still take short breaths. Keep all other body parts relaxed and free to move.;
, It doesn't matter who is grabbing you, if you can get one of their fingers (especially the pinky or index finger) they won't last long. Just pry it off and pull backward. Be careful with friends because this could break a finger if you do it too fast.
 If you can, lean to one side and throw an elbow back at their head. Do this very fast and yell while you do it. This will surely surprise any attacker.
 If they are holding you in the air, swing a leg back and up right into the groin (supposing the attacker is a man). Even this will take several hits though.
 If you are still rooted on the ground, try to bend forward. They will have no leverage if you have them leaning over your back. Put one of your legs behind theirs and throw your butt upwards, your torso forwards, and your shoulders toward the leg you used. They should flip, but be prepared to go down yourself.
 If you and your attacker are roughly the same size/weight, simply sit down. They can't lift you, or do anything else unless they let go. Since this is an under-arm bear hug, fold your arms down over theirs, grab their wrists, and now by sitting down, you have them in a lever position. I recommend grabbing opposite wrists for better application (ie. your right hand grabs their left wrist).

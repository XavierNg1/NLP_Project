 Pour it into the bowl with the chicken and use a spoon to stir the mixture thoroughly. Set the other half of the sauce aside.
 Heat a cast iron skillet or frying pan with a coating of oil over medium heat. When the oil is hot, place a tortilla in the pan and let it cook for about 30 seconds. Flip it over to cook for 30 seconds on the other side, then remove it from heat and set it on a plate with paper towels. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.


If your pan or skillet is large enough, soften more than one tortilla at a time.
Add more oil as needed, since the tortillas will absorb it as they cook.
 Take a tortilla and fill it with a few spoonfuls of the chicken and sauce mix. Sprinkle a liberal amount of cheese over the chicken. Roll the tortilla and place it seam-side down in a greased casserole dish. Repeat the process with the remaining tortillas and chicken mixture.
 Pour the remaining sauce over the enchiladas, and top with a sprinkling of grated or shredded cheese.
 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place the enchiladas in the oven and bake until the cheese bubbles, about 25 minutes. Remove them from the oven and serve hot with sour cream, lettuce, and tortilla chips.

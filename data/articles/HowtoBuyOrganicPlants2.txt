 Unless bought from an organic nursery, an organic plant should come with a label or sign specifically stating that the plant is organic or from a certifiably organic source. If you are unsure about whether or not the plant is organic, ask the merchant about the conditions it was grown under and what, if any, organic practices or products were used in its cultivation. Make sure that the garden center or seller has not been using non-organic, chemical fertilizers or pesticides on the plant.
 Except in rare instances in which the plant is supposed to have an imbalanced look, the specimen you choose should have an even shape and should not be leaning in any one direction.
 If the plant you choose is meant to flower, look for one that had plenty of buds thriving on healthy stems. Look for plants with a few flowers that have begun to open if you do not plant on transplanting the plant into a garden. Do not buy a plant on which all the buds have opened, since you will get shorter enjoyment from the flowers. If you do plan on transplanting the plant, opt for plants that have no open flowers, since transplanting is less harsh on plants that are not fully mature.
 Merchants selling organic plants may use pesticides less often, especially if the merchant does not specialize in organic products. Examine the undersides of the leaves to check for diseased spots or pests. Give a few of the leaves a small tug. If they fall off without much effort, there is a good chance that something is wrong with the plant.
 If the plant you are buying is bare-rooted, examine the roots for signs of unusual brownness, softness, or rot. Good roots are firm and solid.
 If a plant requires full sun and you are unable to provide it with such, you should either be prepared to purchase fluorescent grow lights with it or be prepared to buy a different type of plant that you can care for.

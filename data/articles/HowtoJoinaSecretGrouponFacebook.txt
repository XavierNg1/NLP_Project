 You must already know someone who is a member of the group, as there’s no way to find a secret group’s member list. Once you're added, you’ll see a notification in Facebook.
 You can do this on a mobile device or a computer:

On a phone or tablet, tap the blue icon with a white “F.” You’ll typically find it on your home screen.
On a computer, point your web browser to https://www.facebook.com. If you're not already signed in, enter your account credentials and click Sign In.
 It’s the globe at the top of the screen. All of your notifications will appear., You should see a notification that says something like “<person’s name> added you to the group <group name>.” When you tap this notification, you’ll see the secret group’s contents.

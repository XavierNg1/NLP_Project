 There are a few terms that will help you when you're changing your screen resolution:


Pixel - A pixel is a small point of light in your monitor that changes color depending on what's being displayed. All of the pixels in your monitor work together to display the image that you see.
Resolution - This is the "size" of your display measured by pixels. For example, the resolution "1366 x 768" means that the display is being shown at 1366 pixels horizontally and 768 pixels vertically. At higher resolutions, objects on the screen will be smaller and sharper.
Native (recommended) resolution - This is the physical number of pixels in your monitor, and is usually the highest resolution that can be displayed. Selecting this resolution will result in the clearest image.
Aspect ratio - Since widescreen monitors are very common this isn't as big of an issue anymore. The aspect ratio is the ratio between the width and height of the monitor. Old CRT monitors and early flat panels were 4:3. Nearly all modern monitors are 16:9. 16:10 "cinematic" monitors are becoming popular as well.
 Knowing the native resolution of your monitor will help you quickly get the clearest image. In Windows 7, 8, and most versions OS X, the recommended resolution will be labeled. Below are some common resolutions for monitors:


Desktop widescreen monitors are usually 1920 x 1080, though 2560 x 1440 and 3440 x 1440 are becoming more popular. Older 4:3 flat panels may be 1280 x 1024.
Laptop monitors are usually 1366 x 768, though 1280 x 800, 1600 x 900, and 1920 x 1080 are also common.
MacBook Pro 13"s (2012 and later) have a resolution of 2560 x 1600. Full-size MacBook Pro Retina displays are 2880 x 1800.
"4K" desktop monitors are usually 3840 x 2160. iMac 5K displays are 5120 x 2880.

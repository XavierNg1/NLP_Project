 Scarf Slaking is essentially a Slaking that is holding the Choice Scarf which dramatically ups its speeds to do some hefty damage and probably out speed the opponent with its already amazing 100 speed.;
, The Choice Scarf can be found in the Battle Maison for both X and Y. As said before, it raises the speed incredibly but of course it has its price. The Choice Scarf will up your speed in return for a singular move to be used only. For example, if you had a Garchomp with a Choice Scarf and it went for Outrage, it would most likely be faster than the opponent and land the hit. Then, Garchomp is forced to use Outrage unless it is switched out or fainted.
 It ups the Speed but lowers the Special Attack, and Slaking isn't much of it anyway.
 Since Slaking is a powerful Pok√©mon, give it 252 Attack, 252 Speed, and 4 HP. 252 Attack for powerful Giga Impacts, 252 Speed for you to go first, and 4 HP to help Slaking just a bit.
 Perfect for Truant.
Earthquake - Nice ground move to have.
Brick Break - To go against normal/steel types as well as breaks screens.
Sucker Punch - Always go first but only hits if the attacker is using an attacking move.
Other moves could be any of the elemental punches (Fire, Ice, Thunder Punch), or Night Slash since it has a high critical hit ratio.

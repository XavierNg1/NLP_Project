 It's only smart business to ensure that your client has the means to pay you for your work. Asking for bank references is certainly not out of line, especially if the remodeling job is significant. Additionally, if you discover that your potential client has a history of dragging out payments, you may wish to decline bidding.;
, Do a walk-through with the client and review his expectations. Concentrate on the details of the job. If they are considerable or extra demanding, this might not be a job you want to bid on due to the extra time and attention it will take. If access to the area is limited or difficult or your working conditions are not desirable, you might be better off choosing not to bid on the project.
 If they are not, carefully interview the client about the remodeling job and all aspects that she hopes to receive as a result. This will help to clear up any misunderstandings later.
 This would include drywall, lumber, fixtures, wiring, etc. Figure the costs for all supplies.
 A sub-contractor might be used for concrete, electrical or plumbing work.
 It's always a good idea to increase your labor costs by 5 to 10 percent. This helps to cover any unforeseen problems. Your bid should also include contact information for you, payment requirements, an expiration date for the bid, and any exclusions for the bid. Your proposal functions much like a contract when accepted by the client.
 Make two copies. Put one in your files, and give one to the client.
 This will help the client understand the bid and will help you find an errors, if there are any. Any errors should be corrected immediately, and the client should be provided with a new bid as soon as possible.

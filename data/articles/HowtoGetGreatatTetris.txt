 This is probably the most dangerous step, as it will be hard to put it back down. Turn the game on.;
, Select game type A, and set it to speed 0.
, See how good you are, see where you get to. Play the whole game only once. When you die, simply shut the game off and turn it back on again.
 Repeat step 2, but not step 3.
 Begin to practice O' Reilly Tetris. O' Reilly Tetris is just Tetris, with a catch. You can't spin the pieces! You can move the pieces, but can't turn them.
 Play Tetris without flipping, turning, or spinning pieces. See how far you get. You will most likely get a terrible score, but do not be discouraged, it is almost impossible to get a score over 2500 using this method.
 Then begin to give yourself leeway, allow one or two flips a game.
 Try different ways of moving the pieces; develop a strategy.
 However, do not aim to get a triple or a Tetris, be happy with a single or double. After you feel comfortable, begin to play normal Tetris, and you will be surprised at your score.
 If you are still not getting very good scores, repeat steps 1-7.
 Practice Tetris, try to get as far as you can, and you will be able to finally stand up to the endless rain of blocks!

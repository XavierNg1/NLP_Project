 If you try to jump in and begin coding projects right away, you might find yourself hitting a lot of dead ends because you just don't know what to do. Instead, learn the basics of the coding language you're interested in first. That way you know what each command does and where it might be useful.For example, if you want to use your coding skills to create animations, you should learn the basics of JavaScript first. Learn why you start a command with "g." and in what order your commands should be listed. Once you know these basics, using them to code more and more complicated projects can be a little easier.
 If your first coding project is a big project with lots of different steps, you might feel overwhelmed and lose interest in coding. If you start with a small, personal project, you can see the results of your work more quickly. Making it a personal project prevents you from feeling pressure from the person you're coding for.For example, you could start with a very short animation, where your cartoon character only does one thing - like waving.
 As you learn to code, keep a list of the projects you've completed. If you ever feel discouraged, or like you haven't accomplished much, you can look back at your portfolio. You'll be able to see how much you've done and how you've been able to complete harder and harder projects.

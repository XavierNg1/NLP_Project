 A fearful cat may adopt one of two body silhouettes, or stances, depending on whether she wishes to convey a submissive message (she is no threat to the would-be aggressor and she does not want to fight), or an aggressive message (she is fearful but prepared to fight)., In a submissive silhouette, or stance, cat will adopt a hunched, or crouched, sitting position with her tail tucked away between her back legs. These cats would far rather distance themselves from the danger by running away.


If the threat continues and she is unable to escape, she will be forced into aggression.
 The classic Halloween cat shape is an example of a fearful cat on the offensive. The hunched back, erect tail with a hook at the end, and erect fur are all attempts to make the cat look larger and more imposing than she really is.


The hook at the end of the tail is actually a sign that the cat is not feeling confident.

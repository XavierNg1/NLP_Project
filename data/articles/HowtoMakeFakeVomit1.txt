 You can also break them up with your hands as well.If you can't find any crackers, you can use biscuits or light-colored cookies (ie: vanilla wafers, sugar cookies, graham crackers, etc.). Don't chocolate chip cookies or Oreosâ€”those are way too dark!;
, You can use a bowl, sink, or even a toilet.If you want to make more vomit, chew up and spit out more crackers.
 If you spat the crackers into a toilet, you don't need water. If you spat them into a bowl, bag, or sink, then add in a little water. This makes the vomit look more real.You can also try some white vinegar, apple cider vinegar, apple juice, or even a little milk.
 Wet cat food or wet dog food work great for this. You can also use a little bit of tinned tuna or even baby food. It will help make the vomit look (and smell!) more real.You could also chew up some cereal, spit it out, then mix it with vinegar.


Add some on the toilet seat. It'll look like you missed!, If you used the toilet, don't flush it! If you left it in a bowl or trash bag, you could take it to a parent, guardian, or teacher, and say that you threw up.

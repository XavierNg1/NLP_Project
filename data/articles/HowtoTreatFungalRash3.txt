 Hygiene plays an important role in fungal growth. Chances are, if you donâ€™t normally clean the areas of your body that are usually warm and moist, you will grow fungus easily. Ensure that you regularly clean and dry all parts of your body.You should make sure that all parts of your body are cool, dry, and moisture-free.
Keep affected areas dry and clean, especially in areas where there are skin folds.
Always dry your feet after washing them.
Always cut and trim your nails.
 Sharing these items, such as towels, toothbrushes, socks, and underwear, can bring you into contact with fungus. In order to be certain that you don't pick up an infection from anyone, try to avoid sharing items that come in regular contact with the body.


Use slippers when walking in saunas and communal shower facilities to avoid stepping on fungus.
 Regularly washing clothes, especially undergarments, will remove fungus from the garments. Additionally, keeping garments clean and free of sweat will prevent the creation of an environment suitable for fungal development.


Change your socks every day. Wear socks made of cotton, which is a more breathable material that will help keep your feet dry.
 This is especially important for rooms like the bedroom or bathroom, where you might spend a lot of time with exposed skin. Use disinfectants in the bathroom, and try to keep sinks, tubs, and showers dry when not in use. For the bedroom, wash bed sheets and covers regularly.
 If you are overweight, diabetic, incontinent, or sweat heavily, you will be at greater risk for contracting a fungal rash. Certain lifestyle changes may also increase the risk of fungal rash. People who are taking high-dose or long-term antibiotics, have started using new skin care products, or have lost their mobility could contract a fungus as a result of these conditions.

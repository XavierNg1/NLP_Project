 The absolutely ideal thing to use to tackle anything stuck between your teeth is some dental floss. If you have some handy, or keep some in your desk drawer at work, this is your best choice. This is the safest and most effective way to clean out food from between your teeth. Break off a length of floss that is about a foot long.Then wrap each end around your two index fingers so you have about two inches of floss between your fingers to work with.
Pass this through the gap between your teeth to work the food out. Try to keep the floss tightly pressed against your tooth so you don't risk cutting your gums.;
, If you don't carry floss around with you, or you find it awkward to use when you are out and about, there is a more convenient alternative. Flossing-sticks are small plastic devices that have Y shape at the end. Between the two points of the Y there is a small length of floss which you can use discreetly to clean up any stuck food.


If you have a couple of these in your desk they are even preferable to a toothpick.Flossing-sticks will mean you can avoid fiddling around with long lengths of floss and get the job done quickly and efficiently.
 If you don't have floss but still want to have a dentist-approved device to pick your teeth, you can try using an interdental brush. These are smaller than a normal toothbrush and are specifically designed to get in between your teeth. They are available in a variety of sizes from your pharmacy or dentist, are a good alternative to floss, and a safe way to clean out any food that has gotten stuck between your teeth.

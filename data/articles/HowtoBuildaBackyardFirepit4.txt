 A fire in an open pit may be illegal in your area.
 Check with them first and tell them you will reduce the smoke as much as possible.
 Don't just let the fire go out on its own. Ash and embers can remain hot and dangerous for a long time. Spread the coals around the bottom of the pit and douse them with water until all smoke and steam has disappeared.

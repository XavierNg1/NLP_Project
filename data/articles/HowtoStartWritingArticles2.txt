 If you read an article you enjoyed and admire in terms of style or voice, look at the byline to see who wrote the article. The journalist will likely have an email address or other contact information. Send the reporter a brief and professional email outlining your desire to write articles for a publication and ask for any suggestions on your work.If you are looking to get published in the paper the reporter works for, you may ask if they would be willing to pass on a pitch from you to the editor or if they can connect you to a contact that will help you get published.
Avoid sending a casual or informal email to a writer or journalist. Always be professional in tone and don't take up too much of the reporter's time by writing a long-winded email or letter.
 Most areas have a writing scene or arts scene that involve writers and reporters. Look for open mic nights in your city, join forums or groups online that organize readings or writer get togethers, and seek out other reporters at local writing events. Introduce yourself to people at these events to get a sense of the writing scene and make yourself known.
 It can be difficult to deal with feedback from readers and editors, especially if you are just starting your writing career. But feedback will help you become a better writer and give you a thick skin when it comes to criticism. A good editor will provide constructive feedback on your article, with notes on any issues or problems they might see in your work, and how to correct them.Don't afraid to ask for feedback if you get a rejection on a pitch letter or a first draft of an article, and use the editor's notes to improve your writing. This will serve you well as you move forward in your career, as each article you write will become better and better with each small adjustment or improvement to your writing style.

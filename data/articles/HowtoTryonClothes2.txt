 If you try on pants with athletic shoes on but intend to wear them with heels, you might find that they are too short later on.
 If something doesn't fit quite right, a tailor might be able to fix that for just a few dollars.
 If trying on any kind of underwear or bathing suits, keep your own underwear on underneath. You never know who tried it on before you!

, No matter what you're trying on, try walking, bending over, and reaching for something high up. You might find that the clothing is uncomfortable, revealing, or just unflattering in different positions.

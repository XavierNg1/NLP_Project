 Wash it, blow it out, then straighten it a little with the blow dryer or a hot comb (NOT a flat iron!). Then, trim off any split ends.;
, This allows the scalp to heal, as opposed to skipping straight to the perm and applying so much pressure to the hair in one day. A perm will not get along with an aggravated scalp (learned that the hard way...)

, This will keep any chemicals from getting in your eyes or onto your skin.
 Lye-free would be the best choice for your hair. Lye is a very strong chemical that can cause a burning sensation on the scalp.
 Rinse real good, as any residue might cause problems.
, Blot excess water with a towel. You should already be able to see how different your hair has become.
, The glosser is already in your hair, so it won't get damaged.
 If you don't keep a perm moisturized, especially the ends, your hair will dry out and break off.

 Different kinds of women experience sexism in different ways. The problems Black women face are different from the problems Asian women face. Luckily, plenty of different women have written about the different problems in their communities! You can look it all up.;
, When a woman is telling you about her experiences with sexism, it is important to listen to her. Do not try to empathize - if you are not a woman, you cannot understand what sexism feels like. Instead, try to sympathize! Accept and validate her feelings, and ask her what people can do to prevent that situation from happening.
 This is not as formal or difficult as it sounds. This simply means confronting sexism when you see it - among your friends, your family, at your workplace. If you are a boss, you need to make sure the women you work with have their work recognized and, most importantly, feel safe and comfortable at work. If you are hosting a party or planning a convention, you need to make sure that the women at your even feel safe and comfortable. If you make art, you can incorporate feminist messages into it.
 Look for projects that address social ills or inequalities, especially ones that focus on women. Consider groups such as...


Women's shelters
Political action groups
Resources for rape/abuse survivors
Reproductive rights groups
Other causes you believe in

, Women face additional barriers due to sexism, so one way to help is to give them extra support. Be there for the women around you, and be kind and supportive. Help them when they're struggling, and cheer them on in their triumphs.

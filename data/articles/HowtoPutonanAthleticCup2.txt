 Choose underwear that is snug and tight-fitting over your cup-jockstrap because it will help hold the protector cup in place.


If your underwear is too loose it will not hold you in place.
Excess material under the cup could prevent the cup from working properly. If you wish to wear something under your cup athletic supporter, you should wear thin spandex/nylon briefs which have a pouch.
 A cup athletic supporter has a pocket or pouch in the front to hold the protector cup..


The cup athletic supporter should have a snug fit to keep everything in place.
Bend, squat and do some practice moves to make sure the supporter fits without constricting your movement.



The sides of the cup should rest against the tissue over your pubic bone and the cup should completely cover your penis and testicles.
If your penis and testicles do not fit properly, graduate to a larger cup. There are two kinds of cups. One is called a banana shaped cup and the other one is called the traditional or triangular shaped cup.



Testing your cup with movement is the best way to determine how the cup will feel when being worn. You may need to wear it for awhile to be able to decide if you like how it feels on you..You may want to try both the banana cup and the traditional cup to find out which style you prefer.

 Copyright Office. Technically speaking, any photograph that you take automatically belongs to you for a minimum of 25 years.In practice, however, you will need to formally register your images if you want to bring a lawsuit for infringement upon your work. A copyright will provide solid legal evidence of your ownership, which can make it much easier to fight back against intellectual property infringements.You can register your photographs online or through the mail.


If you register your photographs, you are eligible to collect statutory damages of up to $150,000 for each copyright infringement.Avoid third-party, non-governmental copyright registration services. You might be able to avoid fees with these services, but your claim to the copyright will not hold up so strongly in a court of law.;

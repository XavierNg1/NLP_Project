 Go the extra mile, you will see great improvement.


Just throwing for 15 minutes a day with a partner(s) will have such a large improvement on your skill level.
Along with throwing, bat as often as you can. Many professional players still use tees. Use a tee against a wall, fence, net, etc. Just make sure you're getting hitting time as often as possible.

 A Tupperware container works well and can be cleaned out easily when you're finished. Ziploc bags for smaller pipes and bowl pieces are also good, since they can be disposed of after use.


Try to avoid using cooking pots since the resin can end up staining them.;
, Purchase a few denture tablets from the general store. Once the pipe is inside a container, place the tablets on the gunk left over from smoking.These tablets can also be substituted out for homemade cleaners such as salt and water, salt and vinegar, or baking soda and vinegar. Use equal amounts of your chosen ingredients and stir them together.
 Add hot water from the faucet to the container to submerge the pipe. The dissolving tablets create a fizz that will work on the pipe’s stains. Make sure the water isn’t boiling, or else it can crack the glass. Let the pipe rest for 20-30 minutes.
 After 20-30 minutes have passed, the gunk in the pipe will have begun to break down. To hurry the process and lift smaller pieces, use a straw-shaped pipe cleaner from a smoke shop or the craft store. Move the pipe cleaner around the bowl and push it through the stem., Place the pipe back under the faucet. Use hot water to remove all the gunk and cleaner. Afterwards, set the pipe aside to dry.

 Shake the can well before spraying, and then add an even coating of primer to the entire object. Only one coat is necessary, but if you would like to add two it is fine. Wait for the recommended drying time before adding spray paint.
 As with the primer, shake well before using. Apply one slow, even coat over the entirety of your project. It will likely be splotchy and show the original color through the paint, but this problem will be rectified with a second coat of paint.









Test the spray paint on an old board or piece of newspaper to make sure there is no blockage in the nozzle that might prevent an even coating.
Hold the can of paint about 8 inches (20.3 cm) away from your object, and move it back and forward slowly at a rate of about one foot per second.
Don’t apply a heavy coat, as this increases the likelihood for dripping and will be tacky longer which makes it more likely to get smudged. Instead, apply multiple thin coats of paint., Most spray paints require a minimum of 24 hours drying time before applying a second coat. Don’t rush this process, as being patient will give the paint the best adherence and help it to stick longer over time.
 Although this might not always be necessary, applying a second coat for good measure is safe practice. It will guarantee total coverage of your project and the brightest color.
 Allow time for it to dry completely after the second coat, and remove any tape that you used. You’re finished! Clean up all tarp or newspaper and store extra paint in a clean dry area.

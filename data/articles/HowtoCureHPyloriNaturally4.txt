 If a doctor determines that you have an H. pylori infection, she may want you to take an antibiotic to fight the bacterial infection. Your doctor will likely recommend two or more antibiotics to be taken for at least 2-3 weeks or longer, depending on your response to the antibiotics.


Some of the more common antibiotics used are amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline.
 Drugs that decrease acid levels (Proton Pump Inhibitors or PPIs) or a class of drugs called H2 blockers are often recommended along with the antibiotics. The decreased acid levels provide a less-than-ideal environment for the bacteria while the antibiotics kill them.
 In addition to the acid reducer and antibiotic, your doctor may suggest a bismuth solution like bismuth subsalicylate (eg Pepto Bismol TM). Bismuth solutions such as Pepto-Bismol wonâ€™t kill off the bacteria by themselves, but they do work well in combination with the antibiotics and the drugs that lower the amount of acid in the stomach.


About 70-85% of people treated with these combinations are H pylori negative after treatment with all three medicines. There are a number of different possible combinations of two antibiotics, a bismuth salt, and an acid-lowering drug, so talk to your physician about her recommendation.

 You may have make a mistake on the times for the flights, re-check them to be sure.
 You will barely have time for food in the morning, there's no time to finish packing. Lock your cases as well so you can literally grab the cases and leave the house.
 You and your kids definitely don't want to be tired for your big day. The kids might be able to sleep in the car, but you probably won't. Even if you can sleep in the car, get an early night anyway. Wake up feeling refreshed and prepared for the day ahead.

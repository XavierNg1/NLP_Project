 Once the large chicken breast has cooled, you should shred it. You don't have to prepare this chicken right as you're making the chilaquiles. You can do this earlier in the day, or use leftover poached chicken from the day before., To make the red sauce, put a can of tomatoes, a jalapeno chile, 1/4 cup (56.7 g) onion and 2 garlic cloves into a blender, and blend the contents until it becomes the consistency of a coarse puree.
 Here's what you should do to prepare them:


Slice 8 corn tortillas into strips or wedges.
Add canola oil to a skillet over medium-high heat. The oil should measure about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) up the side of the pan.
Fry the tortillas. Fry the tortillas in groups without overcrowding the pan for 10 to 20 seconds each until they are lightly browned and crisp.
Remove the tortillas from the oil and drain them on paper towels.
 Here's how you do it:


Heat 1 tbsp. (14 ml) of canola oil in a skillet and then add the prepared red sauce.
Stir the sauce for 5 to 10 minutes until it becomes thick and dark. Add chicken stock if the sauce becomes too thick, and then season to taste with salt.
Lower the heat and simmer the sauce for another 15 minutes until it is thick enough to coat a spoon.
 Here's what you should do:


Shred the chicken breast into smaller pieces while the sauce is simmering, and slice 1 small red onion into thick rings.
Add the shredded chicken breast to the sauce and stir to combine. Stir the chicken until it is heated through.
 Place the fried tortilla pieces into the pan and stir the mixture together for 30 seconds, then remove the pan from the heat. Taste the mixture and add salt and pepper to taste.
 Crumble 1/2 cup (113 g) of queso fresco or feta cheese, 2 tbsp. (28 g) chopped cilantro and the rings of the red onion over the mixture.

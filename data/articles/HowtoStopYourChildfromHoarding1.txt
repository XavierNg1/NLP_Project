 A characteristic of hoarding behavior is holding on to objects. These objects might be toys, clothes, or random objects. Because of the age of the child, they often hoard items that they can get for free or without the help of an adult. This might include empty boxes, papers, and things you might consider trash.Broken toys, school papers, old clothes, objects from outside, wrappers, and similar items are often among a child’s hoard.
Some of these objects may have sentimental value, but most of these objects are random.;
, Another characteristic of hoarding behavior is an unnatural attachment to the material objects. The child will continue collecting objects, even if they never use them. If they are asked to throw away the object, they get upset and resist.The child may throw a fit if asked to get rid of some of their stuff. They may start screaming, crying, or yelling when told to throw away something.
The child may become violent, especially if an object was thrown away when they were not there.
 Children often become emotionally attached to the objects they hoard. They will check on the objects often to make sure they are there, and they may even worry about them when not around them.This attachment may disrupt their daily lives.
 Unlike adult hoarders, child hoarders may not display the same obvious clutter in their rooms. Instead, they may keep their hoarded objects in very specific places. Common places to find a child’s hoard are under their bed, in their closet, or in a specific corner of their bedroom.Sometimes, this looks like normal child messiness. If you notice disorganization in your child’s room, look for other symptoms.

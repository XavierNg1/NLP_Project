 These packages are designed for the safe storage of the product, and offer the longest potential "shelf life". Here are some things you should know about pesticide containers.


Chemical resistant plastic jugs and bottles are not subject to leaks caused by corrosive chemicals in the pesticide.
Glass bottles for particularly reactive chemicals.
Amber or dark colored plastic or glass containers for photo-reactive chemicals. Some chemicals undergo change when exposed to sunlight, so these are usually stored in colored containers.
Childproof (or resistance) lids. These keep the container from being easily opened by children.
Labels. This is the most important reason for keeping pesticides, or any chemical product (cleaning solvents, herbicides, etc.) in the original container. The label should contain the following information.

Product name.
Specific warnings (avoid contact with skin, harmful or fatal if swallowed, do not breath, etc).
Chemical contents (ingredients)
Expiration, or "dispose by" dates.
Instructions for use.

;
, If you only have a few small containers, they may be stored in a utility room, garden shed, or garage if you can be sure they are out of reach of children, and not exposed to potential causes of leakage. They should not be stored where there is a potential ignition source, such as a furnace or water heater.
 Any container whose label becomes unreadable is manifestly more dangerous.
 These products usually are purchased in a heavy paper sack container, weighing as much as 50 pounds. Although the product container is suitable for storing the material in normal conditions, you may want to by a large, lidded, plastic storage bin like a Sterolyte or Rubbermaid closet storage box if you intend to store the product for more than a few days.
 Even though bulk chemical products usually cost less, they are dangerous to store, and often have a shelf life which can cause their effectiveness and usefulness to decrease over time.

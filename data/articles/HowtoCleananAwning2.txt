 Any type of vinyl and fabric cleaner should work. If the cleaner is in a spray bottle, spray the cleaner over the entirety of the awning in an even mist. Begin by applying the cleaner to the bottom of the awning, and work your way up to the top. The cleaner works best if you don’t wet the awning before using it.Depending on the height of the awning, you may need to use a ladder to apply the cleaner.
Do not use an abrasive cleaner. Abrasive cleaners use friction to take off dirt, sand, and other particles.
 You can also use a soft or medium bristled brush. Begin to scrub the awning while the cleaning solution is still wet. Scrub every part of the awning., Use a garden hose or bucket of water to rinse off the cleaner. Make sure you’ve rinsed it off thoroughly. A chalky film will develop on the awning if the cleaner hasn’t been washed off. Allow it to air dry.Do not pressure wash an awning. Pressure washing can cause damage.

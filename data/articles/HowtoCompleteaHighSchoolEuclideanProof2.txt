 This doesn't have to be overly accurate––formally, it isn't required at all, but it usually helps. Name all points, angles, or other features that you intend to refer to in the proof later.
 State the given assumptions, and what you intend to conclude from them.
 Label the left column Statement, and the right column Reason.
 For the reason, write "given." Even if some of the givens aren't needed until later, it can't hurt to list them early.
 Write each step towards that result, and justify each with an appropriate reason. The types of acceptable reasons are small. They include:


Given
Definition
Axiom (or postulate)
Previously proven theorem (or lemma, formula, law, etc.).
 The following methods are usually acceptable:


Restating it. (The three altitudes of a triangle intersect in a single point.)
Referring to it by name. (Thales' theorem.)
Reference to a text. (Theorem 5.3 on page 124.)
By a standard abbreviation. (SAS).
 For example, if your statement is that triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, you might use this detailed reason: BC = EF (line 5), <ABC = <DEF (line= 13), <BCA = <EFD (line 16), and the ASA congruence theorem. Where the earlier 5th, 13th, and 16th lines of the proof show prerequisite angle and side congruences for ASA to apply., Make sure that each step follows from the previous ones.
 As with all other steps, justify it with an appropriate reason.

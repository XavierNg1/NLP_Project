 Make sure the sock snowman can "stand". Shape the head on three quarters with your hand.
, Use the tip of the sock which you previously cut off to make the cap. To color the snowman, you can use pen and chalk., Glue buttons on the snowman using a hot glue gun. Use one type of buttons for the eyes and other buttons for the "shirt" down the front of the snowman.
 Use a permanent marker to draw a mouth of the snowman or cut out a piece of felt to glue on as a mouth.
 Try to use holiday-themed fabric if you can. Tie the felt around the bottom rubber band as the snowman's scarf.
 Place two small sticks in the holes as arms. Try to push the sticks in further so they don't fall out. You may want to secure the sticks with hot glue.

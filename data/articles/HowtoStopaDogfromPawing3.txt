 Oftentimes, dogs will become nervous and seek out attention if they're not getting enough exercise. This can cause attention-seeking behavior such as pawing. If your dog is pawing a lot, try upping its exercise routine. Play with your dog more often and take it for daily walks.Talk to your vet about how much exercise is safe for your dog, especially if your dog is a senior or if it has underlying health problems.
 Retrieving games are great for dogs with anxiety as they keep your dog focused and active. If your dog has pawing issues, play games like fetch to keep your dog calm.If your dog paws you during a game, pause the game until the pawing stops.
 Dogs that have anxiety issues may not feel like they have space to relax in your home. If your dog is pawing and displaying other nervous behaviors, such as pacing or barking, evaluate your home. Make sure your dog has their own bed and easy access to food and water. Make sure your dog has access to rooms where you hang out frequently, such as the living room, as dogs that feel isolated may engage in attention seeking behaviors., If pawing does not stop with increased exercise, play, and comfort, find obedience classes in your area. Very nervous dogs that are prone to behavioral issues can benefit from professional training.You can find training programs online or ask your vet for a recommendation.

 If you don't want your cat on your desk, you can try to block the cat from jumping up on it. Make the desk unpleasant by having books, papers, or stationary act as hurdles or barriers.

Just be careful though, as a pile of papers can be enticing and can easily tip over with a cat landing on it.
 Adhesive tape can put off many cats from clambering around the desk, as they don't like stepping on the sticky side of adhesive tape. Try placing double-sided tape or loops of packing tape in their way to discourage them.

The only downside of this is when you forget and stick yourself to the desk too!

, If your cat shows an unabated interest in your computing equipment and cords, try a cat repellent spray. There are various commercial and homemade sprays available that are designed to smell bad to cats. These can be helpful in communicating which furnishings are off-limits, perhaps even including your desk chair if it serves as a step up to the desk for the ultra lazy cat.


When using any sprays or moist repellents, make sure that you keep any dampness away from the open or fragile areas of your computing equipment. A little ill-placed moisture is death to electronics.

 Start by de-spinning the cactus and cutting slits down the length of the cactus. You can then carefully peel off the waxy skin of the cactus (illustration is wasteful of green flesh). Then take your knife (preferably a serrated knife) and cut away the dark green flesh until you get to the core. Dispose of the waxy skin, core and most of the white flesh;

Traditional method. Take the flesh and cut it into small chunks; put your chunks in a bowl and use a potato masher to pulverize it.

Modern method. Take your cactus flesh and cut into small chunks; throw the chunks in the blender. Add water so it just covers it barely. Blend until pulverized.
,,, If youÂ´re following the traditional method it's probably a good idea to pulverize some more with your potato masher and let cook for another 12-36hrs. If you used a blender then you should be done with cooking.
 Cut a nice big square out of a clean T-shirt. Put the shirt over a big bowl and use a rubber band to hold the shirt in place. Pour your pulp/juice mixture through the strainer and let sit.
,, Pour the juice into a pot and boil down very slowly at low heat. At this point it might help to use a fan to make it evaporate more quickly. After about 2 hrs until it's approx 2 ounces of liquid or one double shot.
 Evaporate it down to about 1oz of liquid in a pot using heat and a fan and then pour into a glass pie pan and heat it with a fan for about 24hrs. You will end up with some resin like substance that can be scraped up into a capsule and taken or rolled into balls and coated with sugar and lemon juice to make a little candy.

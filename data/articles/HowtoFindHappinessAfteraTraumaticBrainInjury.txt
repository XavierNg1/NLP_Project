 It's amazing how the simple act of smiling can make you feel better. It sounds silly until you do it. It's all about your mentality.;
, We all work very hard and, as much as your situation is less than ideal, you get a break and other people have an opportunity to take care of you. And there is always extra dessert!

, As hard as therapy is, mentally and physically, every step in the right direction will pay off. You can do anything you set your mind to and your health is in your hands.
 Create a routine that allows you to do as much as you can with your situation. Push yourself to become as independent as possible.
 Instead of watching the boob tube all day, open up an enlightening book or watch a TED talk.
 If you are able to move your hand a bit more or speak a little louder, take time to pride yourself on accomplishments. Even though you are on the road to recovery, you should take time to commend your hard work.
 Having a group of people supporting you makes this process a lot easier than recovering solo. Having love behind you is a bigger push than you might think.
 You are a fighter and when there is a will, there is a way!

 These types of paints contain zinc dust and are suitable for repairing damaged galvanized coatings provided the paint containing zinc dust shall have a concentration of zinc dust in the range of at least 65-69% or above 92% in the dried film.
Repair surfaces with paint containing zinc dust shall be clean, dry, free of oil, grease, pre-existing paint, corrosion, and/or rust.
Clean surfaces in according with the requirements of SSPC SP10 (near-white). Where circumstances do not allow blast or power tool cleaning to be used, then hand tools may be used. Cleaning should meet the requirements of SSPC SP2 (removal of loose rust, mil scale, or paint to the degree specified, by hand chipping, crapping, sanding, and wire-brushing)

To ensure that a smooth reconditioned coating can be affected, surface preparation shall extend into the undamaged galvanized coating.
If the areas/surfaces to be repaired include welds, first remove all weld flux residue and weld spatter by blasting, chipping, grinding or power scaling, etc.
 Apply the paint in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations in a single application employing multiple passes to achieve a dry film thickness as specified.
 The cure shall be in accordance with manufacturer’s recommendations.

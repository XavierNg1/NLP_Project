 Draw a square with four equal sides. You can use a ruler to measure each side equally. If you are working off a square that your teacher gave you, you can skip this step.


It is helpful to draw this square in pencil in case you make a mistake and need to start over.;
, To find the center, lightly draw a diagonal line from the left upper corner of the square to the opposite lower right corner (it helps to use a ruler and pencil to do this). Draw another diagonal line from the upper right corner to the opposite lower left corner. Both diagonal lines should interest at one point. This point is the center of the square that will be the key to dividing all the sides of your square equally.


Notice that you have already created four triangles.
 Draw a vertical (meaning from top to bottom) line crossing the midsection (or the center) of the square. Next, draw a horizontal (meaning side to side) line through the midsection. Doing this should divide the square into 8 equal triangles.


If you want to, you can go over all of the lines you have made with a ruler and pen, so that the lines stand out against the paper.

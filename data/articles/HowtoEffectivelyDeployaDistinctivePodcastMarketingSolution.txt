, Create a list of those podcasters that undeniably know exactly what they are doing. Align yourself with only the best. From this list, call them on the phone and pick their brain(s). If you cannot locate an actual telephonic point of contact, wipe them from your list. You want to do business with those that believe in "touching" their market with more intimacy and one-to-one personalization rather than just an email. Remember, you are looking for a friend. A mentor. Not necessarily someone to take your money and be off. A solid partnership (friendship) is your objective here.
 What passion do you share with others? What true value will your audience glean from you? Who is your target audience? Understand your "WHY"!

, What do you need to learn? What do you need to do? What specific date will you be ready? Who will provide you with the support you will need to fulfill your plan. What equipment is required?

, As you roll out your "new-to-you" adventure, don't expect total perfection on day one. Be kind to yourself and know that you will evolve. We all started from square one. Enough practice and desire can make you near perfect, but do be fair with you and give yourself time to grow.
 Listen to your local radio stations. Read books and articles like this one on a daily basis.
 If you really want to crank up the heat on your marketing efforts, than podcasting will give you the significant marketing advantage.

 Text based worlds, large games with all words and ASCII art for pictures were the first games ever, then came the harder to make mmorpgs. These games are single player, programmed in batch script.,

Think, what type of text based world is this going to be? A fantasy one, a sci-fi one, a horror one, a simulation one, another type? This tutorial is focused on a fantasy type, but its easy just to change it around a little.
Think really hard about things like how many monsters, skills, races, classes, professions, items, areas, shops, npcs and other things like that. A single monster can take up to a day to make with a 10 skill game, an incredibly fast typist and a good programmer, then that doesn't count the debugging and everything.
Also, make sure that you have the ASCII art or an ASCII artist, the right music for it, a flute and the knowledge to play it, or a medieval band in your backyard, and also, make sure that people will like your games.
Another major thing that you have to remember is that this is a text based world, so you should make it so that they can move north, south, east and west, and can pick things up, fight with them, sell them, buy things, gain new abilities, advance and things like that. This is just like the Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) games of the 1990â€™s.
 A lot of people would be confused with how to record their character. You need a character sheet for it. Make sure that it has EVERYTHING. A whole journal is good (or write your character sheet in pencil so that it can be erased).

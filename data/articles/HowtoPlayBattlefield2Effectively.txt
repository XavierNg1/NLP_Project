, Vehicles are best used for transportation, as when left stationary, they are easy kills for the opposition.
 Find a style that you can play well and easily, don't be caught off-guard trying to go solo.
 If you think someone is dead, but could be hiding nearby, throw some grenades, force him out.
 Learn where to snipe, where to run, where to drive, find out all the alleys and secret paths, this will give you a huge advantage.
 As much fun as it is to go all out shooting, remember, if their numbers are more, they will probably kill you before you kill them.
 If there are already several snipers on a map, with no-one else nearby, stick around, any soldiers who get too close will have escaped the sniper. Help him out.
 If the rest of your team rushes in, hang back and wait to see what the first skirmish results in. If you win it, run in and pick off the rest, if you lose, head back, regroup and develop a plan.
 Campers just kill someone and then that player comes back and kills them. In essence, KEEP MOVING!! This also makes it harder for snipers to hit you.

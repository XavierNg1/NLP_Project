 The following ingredients simply go together in your Kitchen-Aid or another stand mixer. Then, using the paddle attachment, mix it all up. Once the ingredients are mixed, put on the dough hook and let it knead for 3-4 minutes before rising, shaping, and cooking like normal:


1 3/4 cups lukewarm milk
3 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1 large egg, lightly beaten
4 1/2 cups (19 ounces) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour
2 teaspoons instant yeast, Add this to the warm milk mixture after it has cooled, which prevents the egg from cooking. Beat it into the recipe like normal, continuing from there. Eggs have fat and protein that leads to a richer, slightly denser muffin.
 All of these ingredients are fats used to bind the ingredients, and all of them can be used to subtly flavor and change your muffins. Note, however, that olive oil is the only liquid fat here, which means it should be split half and half with butter instead of being used completely on its own., Looking for a thinner English crumpet? The recipe is almost the exact same, except that crumpets require a thinner, almost pancake-like dough. The extra milk will cover this for you, but you'll need to use Muffin rings when cooking -- the thinner dough won't hold its shape like the English muffin dough does., You'll also need to replace the butter on the pan, but olive or canola oil will cover this easily. These muffins have all the flavor of a normal English muffin, especially if you use a milk substitute instead of just water.

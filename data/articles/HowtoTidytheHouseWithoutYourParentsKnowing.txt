 Tell them that there is a sudden need of groceries, or that your teacher wants to talk to them. Something like that, but an excuse that will keep them out of the house for about 20 minutes. That will leave you enough time to tidy everything up.;
, Sweep the floor and straighten pictures on the wall. Line up shoes or put them in the closet. Make sure it looks nice and appealing.
 The kitchen can be pretty hard to clean, but here are the basic guidelines. Put dishes in the dishwasher or wash, dry and put them away. Sponge down the counter, and do the same thing in the dining room. All of your stuff lying around - put it away!

, Line up TV remotes, fold blankets, vacuum the carpet or rug. Be neat!

, Now, you don't want to touch all of their stuff, so do simple things that won't bother them, like making their bed or putting dirty clothes in the hamper.
 Not that this is that big a deal, but they might look, so make the bed, clear the desk, stuff like that. If you have siblings, briefly do them same in their room.
 You can yell, "SURPRISE! The house is clean!" Or you can pretend nothing happened at all. When they say, "The house is so clean!" you can act as though it was always like that.

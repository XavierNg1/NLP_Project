 When you’re out with other people, pay attention to where he focuses his own attention. Stay quiet for a while and see how long it takes him to draw you back into the conversation, or if he forgets about you entirely. If you’re at a large party and separate to talk to different people, check how frequently he comes back to touch base with you, if only for a moment.Be sure to do this on a case-by-case basis. The situation will probably be at least a little bit different each time. If he hasn't seen a certain friend in a very long time, for instance, he may understandably focus more on them. Look for consistent behavior over time instead of singling out just one occasion.
 Watch his reaction to the idea. If he seems reluctant to introduce you, ask him why. If he can’t give you a good reason, or if he says "sure" all the time but keeps putting it off, question why a guy who supposedly cares about you wouldn’t want other people in his life to meet you.Remember: he may have a valid reason for being reluctant. He may be more worried about what you think of his friends than the other way around. Or his family life may not be the best situation. Encourage him to talk freely about his concerns. The more he confides, the more he cares.
 Observe how he behaves with your favorite animal in the whole world. See if they get along right off the bat, and if not, what sort of effort he makes to befriend it. You and he both know that your pet is going to be with you for a while, so use your pet to see what lengths the guy will go to in order to be part of your life, too.

 It's located at http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/. WINE is an advanced program, but WineBottler adds a user-friendly interface to WINE.

Some programs simply won't work with WINE. If your EXE file won't run on WINE, you'll instead need to use Boot Camp.;
, You'll see this button in the middle of the page; it has a green arrow on it.

If you're running anything lower than OS X Capitan, click the WineBottler 1.6.1 Stable option.
 This will take you to an advertising screen., It will appear in the top-right corner of the screen after five seconds.

Do not click anything else on this page while you're waiting for the SKIP AD button to appear.
If you're using an ad blocker, you'll first need to disable it for this specific page.
 If WineBottler doesn't begin downloading to your computer within five seconds, you can click the "WineBottlerCombo_1.8-rc4.dmg" link to force it to download., To do so, double-click the WineBottler setup file, then drag both the "Wine" and the "WineBottler" icons into the blue "Applications" folder., This will invoke a drop-down menu., It's near the top of the drop-down menu., You should see it in the pop-out window on the left or right side of the drop-down menu. Doing so will prompt an alert., If it isn't, click the circle to the left of "Run directly in "., It's a blue button in the lower-right corner of the alert window. As long as your EXE file is supported by WINE, it will begin to load.

If your EXE file won't run using WINE, proceed to the next method.

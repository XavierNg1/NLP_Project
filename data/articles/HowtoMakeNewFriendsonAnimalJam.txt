 There are more people there, making it easy to find friends.;
, If you don't want to say random things, just wait for someone to come up to you.
 Ask them about things like their favorite color and food. People like it when you talk with them.
, Accept their buddy request and show your den to them!

, Buddies trade sometimes, so ask them if they can trade and start a trade! Don't scam them; they won't be your friend if you do.
 You can go on adventures, talk, go to parties, go to the carnival, watch movies, etc. If you want more buddies, just repeat the steps.

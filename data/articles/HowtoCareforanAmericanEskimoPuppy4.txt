 While the Eskie’s long white coat resists dirt naturally, it is prone to matting if not brushed. You should brush their fur twice a week with a slicker brush, pin brush, or metal Greyhound comb.If your dog’s fur is matted or tangled, you should spray it with a fur detangler before slowing brushing it out from the roots.
During the spring and fall, the Eskie will start to shed their fur.During these periods, you should groom them more frequently to prevent your furniture and clothing from being completely covered in fur., Eskies need baths roughly every three months.Brush your Eskie beforehand to untangle any snarls or matts. Baths can worsen matted fur, so do not bathe your Eskie if their fur is too tangled to pass a brush or comb through it.You may also consider hiring a professional groomer to bathe them. The groomer can help take of matted fur and may be more experienced with bathing a wriggling puppy.
 Your Eskie will grow plenty of fur around their feet. This fur can easily become wet or muddy. If you are worried about your dog tracking in dirt, you can clip back the fur around the foot or ask your groomer to shave between the pads of their feet.If you are planning on showing your Eskie at competitions, you should know that the foot fur is expected to be long. You can trim the fur to keep it neat, but the fur should not be shaved back., Generally, your Eskie should have their toenails clipped every five weeks. If you notice, however, that their toenails are touching the floor while standing, you should clip them back so that your dog is not in pain.To clip your dog's nails, hold their paw firmly in your hand. Trim the nails until you see a small circle develop on the cut surface.
Look for a small, red blood vessel in their nail. This is called the quick. If you clip the quick, it may start to bleed. You want to stop clipping before you reach the quick.
If you do accidentally clip the quick, stop the bleeding by putting styptic powder or corn starch on it.

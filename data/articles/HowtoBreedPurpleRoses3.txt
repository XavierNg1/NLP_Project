 Although it seems unlikely, you can grow new roses out of potatoes. All you need is a potato, some rooting compound, a small pot of cutting compost and a fresh cutting from a purple rose plant.
 Use a nice clean blade to snip about 8 inches (20.3Â cm) off a green rose shoot. Cut off any dead leaves or flowers.
 Dip the end of the cutting into rooting compound, then insert into the potato.


You may need to make a hole in the potato first to avoid snapping or straining the rose stem as you drive it into the potato.






Bury the potato into the pot of cutting compost, allowing the stem to emerges.
 Keep the pot in a light place, away from direct sunlight until roots and fresh growth start to develop.


Cover the plant with a transparent cloche or cut the top off a clear plastic soda bottle and invert that over the plant to make a mini greenhouse.
 Water the cutting just enough to keep the soil moist. It will take about a year to develop enough root growth for replanting elsewhere.

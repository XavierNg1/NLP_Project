 In the heat of battle, an enemy scrambling to set a charge is unlikely to notice the explosive pack. Sometimes you can get away with placing it on the objective, however, many people will fire at the objective blindly, setting your explosive off prematurely. Place it on a wall or on the ground adjacent, but close, to the objective.;
, The game announcer will let you know if someone is taking Position Alpha, and therefore giving you time to let the enemy have it, however, if your C4 fails, you always have the chance to kill weakened enemies.
 The longer you stay near the objective, the more likely your to get killed. Obviously, don't plant C4 right next to an enemy, as they will promptly kill you without remorse.
 C4 does not always have to be used offensively. With the Marathon, Danger Close, and Light Weight perks, you can throw C4 at an approaching enemy, and stand back to watch the fire works.
 They always return to the same place twice. Put C4 in a highly camped spot (Such as the Overwatch Ridge in Afghan) and wait for targets to pass by. If you're lucky, you could get the whole entire team in one spot.

 If you're only using keyboard, mouse, and monitor, you will only need those and your laptop. If you're hooking up multiple monitors, several external drives, a projector, or other devices that cannot be immediately plugged into the laptop itself, then see if there is a docking station available for it. Most Lenovo and Dell laptops have docking stations, so it is possible that you already have one.;
, If you're worried about your laptop's battery, see if your laptop can run on AC power with the battery removed. If it can, remove the battery. Then, dock your laptop (if you're docking it). Plug in essentials, such as the hard disks or other external devices. Then plug in the less necessary things, like keyboard, monitor, mouse, projector, speakers, or headphones.
 Don't make the work go to waste. Use the station as you would a desktop. Be sure to occasionally take your laptop out of the station.

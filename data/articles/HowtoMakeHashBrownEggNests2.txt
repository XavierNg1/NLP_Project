 Grease a 12-well muffin tin, then set it aside., Thaw the hash browns first, then use your fingers to break them apart into a bowl.

If you don't have hash browns, cook 3 to 4 potatoes first. Let them cool off, then peel and shred them., Stir everything together well with a spoon. Be careful not to mash the hash browns too much, however; you want them to retain their shredded texture., Use a tablespoon to distribute the hash brown mixture into each muffin well; you will need about 3 to 4 spoonfuls for each well. Next, use your fingers to press the mixture against the bottom and sides of each well, forming a nest-like shape. The nest needs to be big enough to hold an egg., You are ready for the next step when the cheese melts and the hash browns turn crispy on the edges. Save time by frying the bacon while the hash browns are baking. Let the bacon drain on a paper towel so that it's extra-crispy., Once the baking time is up, pull the hash brown nests out of the oven. Crack open an egg into each well.

Save time by reducing the oven temperature to 350°F (177°C). This will give it time to reach the right temperature as you finish preparing the nests.
 Sprinkle the remaining ½ cup (50 grams) of cheese over each egg. Crumple or chop the bacon up, then add it to each nest. Top the nests off with chopped, fresh parsley. If you want to, season them further with some salt and pepper., If you have not yet already, reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (177°C). Once the oven reaches the right temperature, put the muffin tin back into the oven. Bake the nests for 13 to 16 minutes. They are ready when the egg whites set., After about 5 minutes, run a knife around the outside of each nest. Use a fork to pop the nests out and transfer them to a plate. Serve them while they are still warm.

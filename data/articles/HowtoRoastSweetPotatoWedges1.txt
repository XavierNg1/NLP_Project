 Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 C) and lay a sheet of aluminum foil on a baking sheet. Set the sheet aside while you prepare the sweet potato wedges.The aluminum foil will keep the potatoes from sticking to the pan.;
, Wash 2 large sweet potatoes. Use a sharp knife to trim off and discard the ends of the sweet potatoes. Cut the sweet potatoes lengthwise into medium-sized wedges.You can peel the sweet potatoes or leave the skin on if you prefer.
 Transfer the sweet potato wedges to a large mixing bowl. Drizzle the wedges with 2 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil and sprinkle them with 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1 tablespoon Italian of seasoning, and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. Toss the mixture, so all the wedges are coated.If you'd like a little heat, consider adding a bit of cayenne pepper to the mixture.
 Place the coated sweet potato wedges onto the prepared baking sheet. Spread them around, so they're in a single layer and will roast evenly. Put the sheet in the preheated oven and bake the wedges for 30 minutes. They should become soft.For best results, roast the sweet potato wedges shortly before you plan on serving them.
 Remove the pan of sweet potato wedges from the oven and turn the broiler on to high. Place the sweet potato wedges under the broiler for 3 to 5 minutes. Let them cool for 5 minutes on the pan before you serve them.The sweet potato wedges should become golden brown and very crispy once they've finished broiling.
 The crispy sweet potato wedges will begin to soften if they sit for a long time before you serve them. This is why it's important to serve them right away. Consider serving them with your favorite dipping sauces. For example, you could dip them in:Yogurt herb sauce
Tangy ketchup
Sriracha mayonnaise

 If at all possible, it's best to have a dentist extract an adult tooth. Your adult teeth have longer roots, making it much more painful to remove an adult tooth. Plus, you'll likely have infection underneath that the dentist will need to deal with.You can lose a lot of blood, as well. In some cases, with the infection and the loss of blood, pulling your own tooth could be fatal.
If you can't afford a regular dentist, look for a dental school in your area, which may do it for cheaper. Also, many cities have free or cheap temporary dental clinics from time to time, which may make it affordable for you.
 Wash your hands thoroughly. That means scrubbing each finger and your palms thoroughly with soap and warm water. Put on latex (or a latex-free alternative) gloves to provide more protection against infection., Try an ancient Chinese method. You don't need any special tools, but it will be very, very painful. It should already be loose if you want this method to work. Start by grasping the tooth firmly between two fingers and wiggling the tooth back and forth as much as you can for 2 minutes., For the next 15 minutes, don't mess with the tooth at all. This waiting period gives your body a chance to build up some fluid behind the tooth. The fluid can make it easier to pull out, though it will still be difficult., Get a good grip on your tooth between two fingers. Make sure you have a solid grip on it because if it slips out of your fingers, that just means more pain as you try again. Twist or pull the tooth to get it out of your mouth.

 Your parents know better than anyone how you got your name. Ask them how they chose it.


Talk with your parents about how you have continued to shape their impression of your name.
If you have siblings, ask your parents how they chose their names. They may have thought about how the names would sound together, or they may have chosen each individually.
Ask if your parents named you before birth or if they waited until they saw you to decide. Some parents feel that they have to see their baby in order to know what his or her name is.If they didn’t name you until you were born, ask them how they knew your name was the right fit.
 If you parents are no longer living or don’t have many thoughts on why they chose your name, you can ask your grandparents, aunts, or uncles if they remember when your parents were choosing your name.


If you were named after someone in the family, you can either ask them directly or ask someone who knew them about their feelings about their name. How did they feel to know someone would be named for them?

, Even if they had no part in choosing your name, other family members and friends might have funny stories about people with your name, or they may have had a reaction when first learning your name


If you go this route, be prepared to hear that not everyone likes your name. They may have had a negative experience with someone else with this name, or it just might not fit their personal taste. Don’t take it personally.

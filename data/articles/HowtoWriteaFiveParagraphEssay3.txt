 The first paragraph of the body of your essay needs to contain your strongest argument, hands down. Get to this argument automatically -- it should be in the first or second sentence. If there's an obvious starting point to your reasoning, use it. Though it's only listed here, each body paragraph should contain the following:



Introductory Sentence. This should include the theme of the paragraph and how that loops to the thesis statement.

Concrete Examples. These should be facts or evidence that comes straight from text like a quote or plot point. This should somehow prove the thesis. Each paragraph should have a minimum of 2-3 concrete examples.

Commentary. This should explain the concrete example, not summarize. Discuss what this fact shows about/means to the theme and/or thesis. What does it prove? Traditionally, each concrete example should have 2-3 sentences of commentary following it.

Conclusion Sentence. This should include the theme of the paragraph and how that proved the thesis statement. This is wrapping up the paragraph, not the paper.
 You want to pad your poorest argument between other, sturdier arguments. The second paragraph is the place to do that.


Again, the topic sentence for this paragraph should be included first thing and should relate back to the thesis in the introductory paragraph. The last sentence in this paragraph should finish off the argument, naturally leading into the third paragraph of the body.
 Body paragraph three should follow the exact same rules as body paragraphs one and two and should contain the second strongest point.


Again, you must open this paragraph with your reasoning. Once you've established your third point, if at all possible, wrap up the evidence. The body of your work is done. Which brings us to...

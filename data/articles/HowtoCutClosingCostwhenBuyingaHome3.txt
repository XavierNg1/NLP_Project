 This means that you will not pay points at closing, and therefore on a $100,000 mortgage you can save $1,000 or more. The trade-off with no-point mortgages is that they are coupled with a higher interest rate.


The only way to decide whether a no-point mortgage is worthwhile is to do the math and determine if a slightly higher interest rate over the course of the loan is worth saving money on paying points.
As a general rule, if you intend to own the home for a short period of time, a no-point mortgage may be the best option.

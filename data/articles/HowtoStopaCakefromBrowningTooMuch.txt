 A shallow pan carries more risk of browning than a deep one.;
, Use two layers of brown paper and two layers of baking paper. Allow this paper to extend above the pan about 5 centimeter (2.0 in) to 7 centimeter (2.8 in). This paper "wall" will help to protect the cake top from browning.
 A flatter surface made by a spatula or knife can help to prevent uneven browning.
 The shelf used should not place the cake too close to the heat source. Bake the cake in the lower half of the oven.
 If it appears to be browning unevenly, turn it in quarters several times during baking.
 Halfway through baking, you can place a layer of kitchen foil over the top of the cake to prevent browning, especially where it has a fruit or caramelized top.

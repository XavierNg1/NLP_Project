 It can be helpful to talk to other parents, caretakers, instructors, or teachers who work with special needs children. Sharing your joys, fears, issues, and challenges with others who can empathize can help you feel less stressed and overworked.


You may have a parent who lives nearby that you can call and talk to or a special needs teacher who you can meet with for advice. Building a support network of individuals will make being patient and understanding with your special needs child that much easier, especially on challenging days.
If you do not yet have a support network of individuals, you may try to meet people at your child’s school, or other parents at your child’s recreational classes. There are also online forums you can join where you can talk to other parents and caretakers about any issues or problems you may be experiencing with your special needs child.
 Look for a support group that meets in your area. Support groups can be a very healthy way to deal with any issues or problems you may be experiencing with your child and allow you to connect with others who can understand where you are coming from., Though you may be determined to care for your special needs child alone, remember that it can be a challenging and difficult job. There is no shame in reaching out to professional doctors or therapists for assistance, especially if you are struggling with maintaining your patience around your child.Your primary care doctor can refer you to a therapist who is trained to work with special needs children as well as the parents of special needs children. You may need to commit to weekly or bi-monthly meetings where you discuss your issues and work on ways to cope with them.

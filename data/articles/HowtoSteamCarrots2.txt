 To serve four people, you will need about 1 1/2 lbs of carrots. Wash the carrots thoroughly in cold water to remove any remaining dirt or pesticides. Chop off the stems of the carrots with a small knife, then peel them using a vegetable peeler. You can then cut up the carrots any way you like: you can leave them whole, slice or dice them, or cut them into rounds.
 Add a tablespoon of water to the carrots and cover the bowl with microwave-safe cling wrap.
 Cook them in the microwave until tender, this should take about 4 to 6 minutes. You can check the carrots with a fork to see if they're done.


If they need a little more time, place them back in the microwave and cook in one-minute intervals until they are just right.






Be careful when rolling back the plastic cling-wrap - it will be hot!







, While the carrots are still in the microwave-safe bowl, add in the flavorings or seasoning of your choice. A teaspoon of melted butter and a little salt and pepper is always a good option. Transfer the carrots to a serving dish and serve immediately.

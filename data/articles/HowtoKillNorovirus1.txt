 If you think you may have come into contact with the virus, you must wash your hands thoroughly to avoid the spread of infection. To wash your hands to avoid contamination, use soap and hot water. Alcohol hand sanitizer is generally considered ineffective against this particular kind of virus. You should wash your hands if:


You have come into contact with someone who has norovirus.
Before and after you interact with someone with norovirus.
If you visit a hospital, even if you don’t think you interacted with anyone with norovirus.
After going to the bathroom.
Before and after eating.
If you are a nurse or doctor, wash your hands before and after coming into contact with an infected patient, even if you wear gloves.;
, If you have been infected and are sick, do not handle any food or cook for others in your family. If you do, they are almost certain to get the infection too.


If a family member is contaminated, do not let them cook for anyone else. Try to limit the amount of time healthy family members spend with the sick family member.
 Wash all food items such as meats, fruits and vegetables thoroughly before consumption or for use in cooking. This is important as norovirus has the tendency to survive even at temperatures well above 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius).Remember to carefully wash any vegetables or fruit, before consuming them, whether you prefer them fresh or cooked.
 Seafood should be cooked thoroughly before eating it. Quick steaming your food will generally not kill the virus, as it can survive the steaming process. Instead, bake or boil your food at temperatures higher than 140F (60C) if you are concerned about it’s origins.If you suspect any kind of food of being contaminated, you should dispose of it immediately. For instance, if a contaminated family member handled the food, you should either throw the food out or isolate it and make sure that only the person who already has the virus eats it.

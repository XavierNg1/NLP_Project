 Pets are usually the reason that fleas and ticks enter homes, so the best way to keep them out is to . Ask your veterinarian for the safest flea and tick collar to use with your pets. Washing your dog with flea shampoo is another good preventative measure you can take.
 In the event that another flea or tick does enter your home, vacuuming the house will ensure that it doesn't stay long enough to reproduce. Vacuum areas where your pets spend time every day, and vacuum the entire house once or twice a week.
 Cloth dog and cat beds should be washed frequently in hot water. If you use a towel to dry off your dog after baths, wash it in hot water right away instead of tossing it into the laundry basket.

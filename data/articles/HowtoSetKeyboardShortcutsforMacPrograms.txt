If you'd like to set a shortcut for all possible apps, select "All Applications."
Not all apps allow keyboard shortcuts.
 Menu commands are the commands appearing in the drop-downs of the application's menu bar. For example, "Print..." and "Save" are commands under the "File" drop-down menu. So, the path for "Print" would be "File->Print..."


Type the command path exactly as it appears in the drop-down from the menu bar. Include capitalization and punctuation (like the ellipsis following "Print"); use "->" to separate the steps.
To set a shortcut for Delete in Chrome, you'd type "Edit->Delete," for example.
 A shortcut must be unique and begin with control, option, command (⌘), or some combination thereof. You cannot use a keystroke more than once in a shortcut.


If you set a shortcut that already exists in the app, it will not work.
 Now, you can activate your keyboard shortcut whenever you are using the app in which you added the shortcut.


Repeat these steps to set additional keyboard shortcuts.

 Let them hit you a couple times and see if you get a pop up on the top right side of the screen. The pop up will tell you that you contracted Sanies Lupinus—this is the werewolf disease.
 It is located on the top right side of Reaper’s March, bottom left corner of The Rift, or in the middle top section of Bangkorai. You will be able to tell it is the shrine because there will be a bunch of players as werewolves outside the shrine, and NPC non-hostile werewolves will be right beside it. There is no map icon; you just need to find it while you are out in the world.
 You will enter a conversation with a mysterious voice, and it will ask if you are willing to accept the gift that you have been offered.

What type of Search Engine Marketing (SEM) are you most interested in? Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a way of planting keywords in your web content so that search engines naturally ("organically") return your site as near the top of the search results as possible. Pay-Per-Click (PPC) Marketing is a bit more expensive but puts your business in front of customers who are specifically looking for what you have to offer.
Do you expect your online advertising agency to handle the marketing for you, or do you just need guidance? If you or your technical team is capable of handling the Internet marketing, then you may just want an ad agency to develop a marketing plan for your business that you can put into action.
Are you interested in a complete marketing plan, or in running a single campaign?;

How will they help grow your business? Not only is increased traffic important, but the rate of conversion from visitor to customer is equally important.

Can they refer you to customers who will give testimonials? Again, positive word of mouth is key.
What kind of fees do they charge and what kind of customer satisfaction commitment do they make (regarding the return of fees)?

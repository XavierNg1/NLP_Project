 These types of stores tend to have a wide variety of styles, representing people from all walks of life. And remember, even if you look at 40 dresses and you don’t like any of them, at least you know what you don’t like.
 Large stores may have women's, misses, and/or juniors departments. Seek the advice of the sales personnel. Most often, sales associates know their department and can give you good advice. Be sure you trust the person you are asking so that you are confident you are receiving helpful advice and not false compliments meant only to induce you to purchase something.
 Think about why a particular outfit appeals to you. You might even feel confident enough to ask her where she got her clothes.

 While not necessary, a template will save you some work by setting up the timeline structure for you. You can check whether you already have a timeline template by browsing options in the File → New or File → New from Template commands. Otherwise, search online for user-created timeline templates. If you don't want to use a template, continue on to the next step.


If your timeline tracks the progress of a multi-branched project, consider looking for "Gantt chart" templates instead., You can set up a basic timeline with an ordinary blank spreadsheet. Type the dates of your timeline in one row, spacing them out with blank cells roughly in proportion to the time between them.
 In the cell directly above or below each date, write a description of the event that happened on that date. Don't worry if it looks sloppy.


Alternating descriptions above and below the date tend to make the most readable timelines.
 Select the row containing your descriptions. Click the Home tab in the ribbon menu, then look for the Orientation button under the Alignment group. (In some versions, the Orientation button looks like the letters abc.) Click this button and select one of the angled text options. The rotated text should make your descriptions fit the timeline.


If you are using Excel 2003 or earlier, instead right-click the selected cells. Select Format Cells, then the Alignment tab. Type in the number of degrees you'd like the text to rotate, then click OK.

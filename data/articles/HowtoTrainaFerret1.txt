 Ferrets hate the smell. Also, everyday before letting your ferret out, spray Apple Bitter on the places or things your ferrets bites. Eventually your ferret will realize that this item or this person shouldn't be bitten. They don't taste good. NOTE: Some ferrets love the bitter apple tastes. Test this before spraying it on everything.;

 Prevent any cleaning solutions from settling in grout on your floor by vacuuming and mopping to thoroughly remove cleaners. Try using a shop vacuum instead of mopping. To do this, put water on your floor and vacuum it up with the shop vac., Every couple of years, maintain your bathroom and kitchen grout and tiles with a sealant. Clean the grout first, make sure it is completely dry, then apply a sealant. Consult with your local hardware store about the right kind of sealant for the tiles you own., Wipe down and dry the tiles in your bathroom and kitchen whenever they are damp, steamy, or wet. This will slow the growth of mold. Also keep your kitchen and bathroom doors and windows open, or use a humidifier or exhaust fan to reduce damp and steam in rooms with tiles.

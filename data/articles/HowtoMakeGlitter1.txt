 You can use table salt, sea salt, or any other kind of white or colorless salt. Place the salt in zip-locked bags or containers with a sealed lid. Use one container for each color of glitter.


Use an amount of salt equivalent to the amount of glitter that you want. There are no other ingredients besides food coloring, so the amount you start with will be the amount of glitter you get.
For a sweeter glitter, you can try using granulated white sugar instead. There's a risk that sugar might melt into a syrup, which will not happen with salt.;
, Add one drop of food coloring, then seal the container and shake vigorously. Repeat until you get the color you want.


If you're using a zip-locked bag, lay it on the counter and knead it to distribute the color.
 Spread the glitter onto a baking sheet in a thin, even layer.


If you're using sugar, cover the baking sheet with parchment paper first. This makes cleanup easier if the sugar melts.
 Preheat the oven to 350ºF (175ºC). Place the tray inside and heat for about 10 minutes. The glitter is ready once the salt is dry again.


If using sugar, preheat it to 300ºF (150ºC) instead. This should stop it melting, but keep a close eye on it if your oven runs hot.
You can just leave the tray out overnight to dry. Make sure it is out of reach of pets and young children.
 Turn off the oven and put on an oven mitt. Take out the tray and place it on a heat-safe surface. Let cool for about one hour, or until glitter has reached room temperature. Store in a sealed container or salt shaker until you're ready to decorate your food.


If the salt has clumped together, break it up with a spoon.

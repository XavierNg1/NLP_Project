Add 1 cup (227 grams) of salt, 1 cup of white sugar, 4 tablespoons (60 grams) of garlic powder and 3 tablespoons (45 grams) of ground black pepper to 1/2 gallon (1.89 liters) of hot water. Stir until salt and sugar dissolve.
Add crushed ice until you have about 1 gallon (3.78 liters) of brine.
Experiment with flavorings in your brine. Add to the brine water apple juice, wine, lemon, thyme, maple syrup, soy sauce, chili powder or onions. You may also add cumin or coriander seeds, jalapeno peppers, fresh herbs, honey or rosemary. Amounts of seasonings vary depending on how much water you use. Do not over-season brine because you could ruin the meat. Add seasonings to your taste.

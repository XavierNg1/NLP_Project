 It’s the yellow icon with a white ghost on your home screen. Snapchat will open to the camera screen.;
, If you finish your video before the timer is up, lift your finger to stop recording.
 It looks like a sheet of paper with its bottom-right corner folded upward. You’ll find it at the top of the screen. This opens the sticker menu, which includes emoji that you can stick to any moving object.
 Tap and drag your desired sticker to the object you want it to follow.


For example, you drag the sticker to your dog’s face if that’s where you want it to appear.
 Now the sticker will follow this object throughout the video.
 Tap the Send button at the bottom-right corner of the screen, then select your desired recipient(s) or story. When your followers view your video, they’ll see your sticker pinned to your selected object.


If you want, you can add additional effects, text, and drawing before sending.

 Once produce is harvested, it is more vulnerable to spoilage in the time between harvesting and storing. Before harvesting or purchasing your produce, research what (if any) treatment each type may need in that in-between time. Gather all the materials and have them ready to use for prompt storage.


Root vegetables, for example, are vulnerable to direct heat and sunlight once they’re harvested. They need to be transferred to a cool environment as quickly as possible., Exercise caution when holding or otherwise handling your food. Avoid dropping, poking, or doing anything else that may bruise, cut, or puncture it. If this happens, discard that piece, since it will now spoil quicker and possibly ruin the surrounding produce that it’s stored with., Expect some produce to be ready to transfer to storage as is once harvested. However, be aware that others need a little more prep work to ensure a longer shelf life. If you’re purchasing produce instead of growing it yourself, some of this work may have already be done, but not always. Again, research your preferred produce beforehand so you know exactly what to do when the time comes.


Root vegetables, for example, need to be trimmed, which will typically already be done with store-bought produce. Onions, meanwhile, need to be cured in the sun for a week, which may or may not have been done.

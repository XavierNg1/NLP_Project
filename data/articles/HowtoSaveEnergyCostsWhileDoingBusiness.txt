If it is a small business, you can do it yourself; otherwise you should delegate this task to some individual or a team, who’ll submit a report after visiting all departments and considering different options for saving costs.;
, This is such a straightforward energy saving step, yet ignored by many offices and businesses.


The light must comply with international standards for workplace, but for whatever reasons, some businesses go beyond these requirements and install excessive lights in the factory or workplace.
Even more bizarre is the case, when lights and other electrical appliances are left switched on around the clock. If there are lots of computers, printers or other electric equipments in your office, don’t just rely on issuing a notice, directing the workers to shut down their PC’s before leaving.
, There are many options available in the market, offering reasonable performance with sufficient reduction in energy consumption. For example, laptops consume less energy than desktop PC’s; therefore you should consider using laptops instead of computers with power hungry monitors.



Heating or cooling at workplace should be used to the extent of ensuring comfortable working conditions. Discourage the use of air conditioners, when switching on a simple ceiling fan will do the job.

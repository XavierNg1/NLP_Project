 While you will not be able to consciously maintain a particular posture while sleeping, how you sleep can have an effect on your waking posture.









Using a firmer mattress will help by maintaining proper back support.
Sleeping on your back will help keep your shoulders straight, and it is usually more comfortable for the back than sleeping on the stomach.
If you prefer sleeping on your side, try slipping a small, flat pillow between your knees to help keep your spine aligned and straight.
Use a pillow to provide proper support and alignment for the head and shoulders. Don't overdo the pillows—–too many, and your head can be bent in an unnatural position; this will hurt your posture and you'll wake up feeling stiff, sore, and groggy.

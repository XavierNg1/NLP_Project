, Once you receive your report, you should review it closely to find any errors. Common errors that can negatively impact your credit score include:late or missed payments erroneously reported
loan modifications reported as “foreclosures”
closed cards reported as “closed by grantor”
bad debts more than seven years old still showing on your credit report

, Each creditor’s address should be listed on the credit report. However, if one is not listed, then you should contact the credit reporting agency and ask for the address.
 Try to find whatever documents you can that support your position that the item is erroneous. For example, if the creditor claims that you missed a payment, then find cancelled checks or statements that show payment. If you requested that a credit card be closed, look for any letters from the credit card company to that effect.


You may also have loan modification documents, which show that you were not foreclosed on.
 Open a blank word processing document to begin your letter. You should insert your address first, aligning it on the left-hand margin. After typing the address, move down two lines and enter the date.Two lines underneath the date, you should enter the creditor’s address.
 If you know the name of a contact person, then you can use it. Otherwise, you should simply type “Dear Sir or Madam” and add a colon afterwards., In the first paragraph, make sure to explicitly state why you are writing. For example, you can type “I am writing to dispute the following information in my file. I have highlighted the items I wish to dispute on the attached copy of my credit report.”, In the second paragraph, you can identify what items you want the creditor to investigate. Also request that the creditor remove the item from your report.


You can write, “The item listing ‘60 days past due’ is inaccurate because I paid my account within the 30-day period. I am requesting that you remove the item to correct the information.”, In the third paragraph, tell the creditor what documents you have enclosed that support your position. Be sure to send photocopies as the creditor probably will not return originals. If you do not have any supporting documentation, then you can skip this step.


Sample language: “Enclosed are copies of three cancelled checks that cover the period in question. Please reinvestigate this matter and delete the disputed item as soon as possible.”, End the letter with “Sincerely,” and then space down three lines before typing your name.You can sign the letter in blue or black ink.


At the very bottom of the page, you can type “Enclosure:” and then list any enclosures., You want to keep copies of all communications with the creditor. For this reason, it is better to dispute with a letter than to submit disputes over the phone or online.Even when a creditor insists that you use an online reporting system, you should still follow up with a letter.
 You should send the letter first class, return receipt requested.The receipt will serve as proof that the creditor received the letter.


Be sure to attach any supporting documentation, such as a copy of your credit report., It is not enough to send a dispute letter only to the creditor. You should also send the letter to the three credit reporting agencies. By sending to the credit reporting agencies, you trigger potential liability for the creditor and the credit reporting agency if they do not properly investigate and get back to you.For instructions on how to contact the CRAs, you can see Dispute Credit Report Errors.
 The credit reporting agencies have between 30-45 days to investigate and then report back to you. Even though you sent a letter to the creditor, the CRA will also forward the dispute to the creditor to investigate. If the creditor cannot verify the information or simply fails to respond to the CRA, then you will win and the disputed item will be removed from your credit report.If you do not hear back within 45 days, then you should send a follow up with another letter. Be sure to send a copy of the original letter as well.In the follow-up letter, ask that the creditor or CRA update you on the status of the investigation.
As always, keep copies of your communications and mail all letters first class, return receipt requested.

 Keep your distance at about six feet or two metres. Keep your eyes on the snake.;
, Do not disturb it in any way.
 If you can't, you will have to handle it yourself, so use extreme care.
, Some snakes won't attack if they don't feel in danger. Move the snake gently out of your path and, hopefully, the snake will go away. Remain vigilant, though-- the snake may turn and prepare to strike. If so, back slowly away and wait, patiently, for the snake to leave.
 If you do, it may attack.
 Wait a little bit and give it time to move farther away.

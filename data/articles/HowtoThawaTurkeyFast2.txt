 Put the turkey into the sink or tub. This method is often necessary if you don't have a container large enough to contain and submerge the turkey.In this case, you will start by putting the turkey breast up, so the water will run into the breast.
 Make sure that your water is cold! Again, it will need to be under 40 degrees, in order to avoid bacterial growth., Make sure that the water is running over and cascading onto your turkey. You don't want to waste water! Your turkey may develop a small pool of water around it. That is fine. Just make sure that the water can drain as new water runs over the turkey.
 Every five or so minutes, try to turn or rotate the turkey. Lay it on its breast, turn it sideways, or rotate it. Make sure that it stays under the water. You'll want to ensure that the turkey is under a slow, steady stream of water., You'll need to keep doing this until your turkey thaws. There isn't a specific formula as there are for some other methods, so you'll need to use your judgment. The smaller the turkey and the better the water flow, the faster it will thaw. You can poke the thick, meaty parts of the turkey like the breast and thighs to see if they feel thawed., If your turkey felt soft enough, you will still want to test it further.The easiest way to do this is by examining the chest cavity and removing the giblet bag. If the chest cavity still has ice crystals, or if the giblet bag is still frozen in, you need extra time.

 Liquid, water-soluble fertilizer with a 10-5-5 ratio is fine.Dilute the fertilizer to one-fourth the recommended strength and mist the air plant with the solution in the morning.
 An air plant that is receiving adequate fertilizer will grow vigorously and have a healthy color, usually bright gray-green but this varies.


Inadequate fertilizer will result in slow growth, but excessive fertilizer will turn the leaves brown and brittle.
 Air plants require healthy air circulation. Although they need to get their leaves wet, if they do not dry quickly the air plant could develop crown rot. Do not place them too close to other plants, walls or furniture.


If air circulation is a problem in the house, set up a fan so that it blows away from the plant and turn it on for an hour or so once or twice a day. Make sure the fan doesn't blow directly on the plant. That would cause it to dry quickly before it has a chance to absorb any moisture.
 If the crown or roots develop rot, they will turn brown or gray and slimy. If the rot is only on the roots, trim off the rotten roots. Crown rot is usually fatal. The plant should be thrown away and replaced with a new air plant.

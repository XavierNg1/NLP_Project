 There are 3 primary components you should be familiar with.



Target Cell. This is the cell that represents the goal or objective of the problem. In our example, we will be attempting to have a schedule that has no shortfall in staffing. The cell that reports any shortfall will be our Target Cell.

Variable Cells are the cells that can be modified to arrive at the desired outcome. In our example, that will be work hours from Monday through Friday for all employees.

Constraints. This are restrictions or limitations to what Solver can do to solve the problem. For example, if Employee X cannot work Tuesdays, Solver is restricted from assigning an employee work on Tuesdays.;

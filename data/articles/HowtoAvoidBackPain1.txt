 Avoid standing in one place for long periods. If you have to for work or some other reason, try to put one foot on a footstool and lean on it to reduce the load on your back. Change from your left to right foot after several minutes to avoid straining.;
, A chair with armrests and a swivel base is usually best for your back. If necessary, place a small pillow or a rolled-up towel at the small of your back to support its natural curve. Your knees and hips should be level, and your feet should stay on the ground.


Get up and walk about briefly every 30 minutes or so.
In addition to having a comfy chair, you should keep your forearms horizontal and your elbows at ninety-degree angles when working on a keyboard.Adjust your chair up or down as needed to achieve this position. Do not lean forward on your desk to reach your keyboard.
Use a footstool if your feet do not lie flat on the ground when your chair is set to an appropriate height relative to your desk.Your computer screen should be at eye-level about an armâ€™s length away to prevent uncomfortable bending of the neck.
 If necessary, put a small pillow or a rolled-up towel behind you in the small of your back.


The same applies when travelling by bus, plane, or train. Stand up and walk down the aisle once each hour.
Stop and pull over every hour or so to walk for a bit if you are on a long car ride.

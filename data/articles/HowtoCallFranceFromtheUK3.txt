 There are multiple services online that allow you to make international and local calls for free or at low cost. Most of these services can be downloaded as apps. Some work well on computers, while others work best when used on a smartphone.Popular online calling apps include Skype, Viber, Google Hangouts, and Vonage.
Check the rates for each service. Some are completely free, while others are only free when used to call another WiFi user.
 You may need to purchase credit to use the app of your choice. This can be done online, generally through the app itself. You’ll probably need to buy credit if you plan to call someone who is using a landline or a mobile phone service.The rates per minute for online calling apps tend to be extremely low compared to other methods for international calls.
 The best (and sometimes only) way to make free international calls is to call someone who is also using the same app as you. This way, instead of dialing someone’s phone number, you simply call them by typing their username on the app.Usually, the person will have to be logged into the app in order to receive your call.
Most apps also have a texting service, so you can send SMS messages as well. These may cost money.
 If the person you’re calling doesn’t use the same app as you, you’ll need to type their number into the app. Most apps ask you which country you’re calling, so you probably won’t need to enter the country code.

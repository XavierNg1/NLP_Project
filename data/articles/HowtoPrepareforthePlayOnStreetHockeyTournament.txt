 Each team consists of 5 players, one of which is your goalie so try to choose people who have experience.;
, You know what they say, practice does make perfect and have your team and yourself practice 2-3 times a week in order to be competitive.
 If you're going to be playing out of town, book a good hotel early in the summer. Hotel rooms get filled up and you don't want to be staying at some small rundown hotel in the middle of nowhere. If you are young, try to book a hotel with a pool and water slide.
 For example, if the tournament fees for the youth street conference are $195 per team, and the hotel room with be $145 for the night gas will be about $70 for 200 kilometers (120Â mi) of travel that comes to $410. If you divide the cost evenly throughout the team that's $82 per player. Do lemonade stands, 50/50 draws, bake sales, and team sponsors.
 Every player needs a stick, good running shoes, tape for the stick, and full eye protection. This would be a pair of glasses that came right against your face or a helmet with a full cage/ mask. You may want shin pads gloves and mouth guards.
 You're going to want shorts and t-shirts and jerseys. Bring a bathing suit if your hotel has a pool.
 The goalie will need a mask, chest protector, gloves, (Blocker and catcher), Pants, Jill/Jock, Goalie Pads, Hard toed shoes, mouthguard, Goalie stick. Buy quality gear as it hurts very badly to get hit with a strong shot.
 Have everyone come over after dinner, pack everything into the car, and do something calming. Do not have a hard practice the night before as you do not want to tire your muscles. Watch a movie of talk, but get to bed early.
 Wake up and have a good big breakfast that is very healthy. This will get your body going.
, Do whatever you must to get it in their net.

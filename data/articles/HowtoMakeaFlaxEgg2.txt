 Don't use pre-ground flax seeds from the store. When ground, flax seeds release oils, which start to perish immediately., You will need 1 tablespoon (10 grams) of ground flax seeds for every egg you plan on making. Because you will be cooking this recipe, it would be more convenient to make larger amounts.

If you have any ground flax seeds left over, place them into an airtight container, then store it in the freezer. This will preserve the oils and keep them from going rancid.
 You will need 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 milliliters) of water for each egg you are making. If you are making more flax eggs, you will need to use more water., This will take about 5 minutes. It may take less time if you are making just one egg, and it may take more if you are making several eggs., If you made several flax eggs, use 4 tablespoons (40 grams) of the mixture for each egg you plan on using. Store the rest of the eggs in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.

If you have a large ice cube tray or mini containers, you can divide the mixture up into individual portions.

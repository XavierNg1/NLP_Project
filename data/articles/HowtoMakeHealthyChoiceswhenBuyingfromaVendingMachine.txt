 Do you want something sweet? Salty? Crunchy? This is important, because you're ensuring that you'll be happy with what you get.;
, Try something like beef jerky or a bag of nuts (any kind). These options are pretty caloric, but nuts are fatty (the good way), and the protein that they're filled with will make you not be hungry for a while. Beef jerky is another healthy choice with a lot of protein. The only thing to watch is that both of these snacks have are filled with salt.
 Try something like a bag of pretzels; they don't have many calories, nor are they very fatty. The only thing to be aware of, though, is, because they are filled with carbohydrates, that they can make you hungry a little later after you eat them. Alternatively, you could get some popcorn that's not heavy, or cheese crackers.


Skip the potato chips; they're not very healthy. But, if you are absolutely dying for potato chips, get the baked kind rather than the fried kind.
 Find something like a bag of cookies that don't have much fat, candies that taste like fruit, snacks of fruit, or licorice. Refrain from selecting little chocolate doughnuts, as they're high in calories, and have about 40 grams of sugar.


Look for the healthiest candy bar choice if you prefer a candy bar. Try the Payday bar, one of the healthiest choices because it's filled with nuts. If your vending machine doesn't provide a Payday bar, try a nutritional protein or energy bar in alternative. These types of bars are lightly nutritional.
 This is a healthy option, and you won't be taking in many calories.
 Sometimes, you run out of options. Find the person who works at and puts snacks in it to think about furnishing other healthy options for you to order.

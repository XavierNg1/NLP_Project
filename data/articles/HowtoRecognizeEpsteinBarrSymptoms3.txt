 Avoid sharing toothbrushes, drinking glasses, water bottles, utensils, lip products, and other personal items with other people. EBV is most commonly spread through saliva, so you can reduce your chances of getting it if you don’t share these sorts of items, even with people who appear healthy., Because EBV is found in saliva, you can get it through kissing (this is why mono is called the "kissing disease"), sharing drinking glasses, or using someone else’s toothbrush.
 The virus is also in blood and semen, so you can get it by having sex, from a blood transfusion, or an organ transplant from someone with the virus.

 Visual Studio is Microsoft's suite of development tools used to create software (programs) for the Windows operating system. Fortunately, Microsoft provides a completely free version of Visual Studio named "Community" for those who collaborates in open-source projects or makes software as a hobby.
 The process of reverse engineering is dissecting a program's internals in order to study its behavior or its code. In Roblox exploiting, this is necessary as you need to know how Roblox works in the inside in order to make hacks for its client. There are many reverse engineering tools out here, but the most prominent ones are IDA Pro and Binary Ninja., A debugger is used to locate and fix bugs in software, and in some cases, it's also used to modify a program's behavior. While not completely necessary, using a debugger may help you in diagnosing issues in either Roblox's code or your very own exploits. If you purchased (or plan to purchase) IDA Pro, then you don't have to obtain a debugger as it already comes with one (the IDA debugger). Else, you can obtain a free debugger from the Internet, such as OllyDbg.

Alternatively, if you have Cheat Engine (a popular cheating tool for video games), then you could also use its debugging features, albeit they're known for their instability.
 High level languages such as Lua, Python or Go lacks the features and compatibility needed to develop Roblox exploits, whereas low level languages such as C/C++ and Ada can manipulate structures that are necessary to make a working hack. Additionally, considering that the Roblox client is programmed in C++, it would make sense for you to make your hacks in that language too (but it's not necessary)., A lot of free ebooks/PDFs about reverse engineering can be found through a simple Google search. Some of them may require deep understanding of how a computer works, but if you narrow down your search to the subjects youÂ  specifically need to know (such as reversing C/C++ software), then you can find some relatively easy guides that'll help you understand the process of reverse engineering., Roblox's largest exploiting community out here, V3rmillion, contains plenty of guides related to developing and using Roblox exploits. While the majority of users on V3rmillion doesn't like people who are new to the exploiting scene, some can be highly welcoming and will help you in developing an exploit., Fortunately for newcomers, seeking help from benevolent (and competent!) exploit developers is a breeze. A collective of expert Roblox reverse engineers called "Rain" can be contacted on V3rmillion, and some of their highest ranking members will definitely be happy to give you a hand in developing your very own exploit. Take note that some other exploit developers, which are Jordanic or anarchojordanic (a term coined by V3rmillion users to describe users who aren't willing to help on the basis that making your own things by yourself is better than collaborating with other users), exhales elitism and rarely wants to help other people, so you need to make sure that you're contacting the right people., Certain exploit developers have released the source code to their exploits to the public so people can understand how they worked. This might be very beneficial to the process of learning how to develop Roblox exploits. Plus, code that was developed over two years ago still works nowadays and is constantly recycled by exploit developers (as the code is known for its stability and its ease of use), and is currently in the public domain, so don't be afraid to use code coming from already existing exploits in your own projects, as long you understand how the code works and what it does., While some users want to keep their hack(s) to themselves, some want to release them to the public for the greater good of the Roblox exploiting community. You can easily locate a website to publish your exploit. In fact, any video-game-cheating websites is a good website to post your exploit on., Some exploits that grew big formed a big, organized community usually revolving around a group chat. Communication software such as Discord or Skype is perfect for your exploit's users as they are free and usually bug-free. Please note that you don't have to create a centralized community for your exploit: most free exploits out here doesn't grow big (this is almost always the case), so their creators usually doesn't spend their precious time creating a Discord server or a Skype group chat for their exploits., Selling or releasing your exploit for free is entirely up to you, but if you happen to be low on funds, then selling your exploit might help you get some money. The exploit business is very profitable (in fact, more than ever: the number of exploits sold in 2017 doubled over the course of simply 3 months) and the prices usually range from 30 to 60 US dollars. For example, the "ProtoSmasher" exploit generated (approximately) over one thousand dollars merely two days after the exploit's release.

Take note that selling an overpriced exploit will always decrease sales, so make sure your exploit's price is adjusted depending on your hack's capabilities.

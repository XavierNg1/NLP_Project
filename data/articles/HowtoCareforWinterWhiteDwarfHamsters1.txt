 The minimum cage size for one hamster is 360 square inches of floor space; the minimum for two is 720. It is recommended that you have cages larger than that, though. You can house two or more winter whites, as long as they are from the same litter. Make sure the cage is put where there is no direct sunlight.;
, About 3 inches (7.6Â cm) of bedding or more. Do not use pine or cedar bedding for your winter white. Softwood beddings such as pine and cedar have dangerous chemicals which may cause respiratory problems for your hamster.
 Do not place the cage in front of a window. The hamster should not be under direct sunlight.

 There are several websites that you can use in order to find both pure breeds and mixed Cavaliers.You can also look in your local newspapers for advertisements. Depending on your location, youâ€™ll have more or less options.
 Find one that can give you the history of the puppy's parents and grandparents, including written health test results. You want to avoid choosing a dog that is the product of inbreeding, so ask to see pedigree papers and quiz breeders about the dog's heritage. If you are buying from a private seller, ask for the same pedigree materials., Rescues are great places to find non-Purebred Cavaliers. Before falling in love with a particular rescue dog, make sure you have a full grasp of the dog's medical needs. Many rescues have ended up at rescue centers because they have medical needs their original owners couldn't handle.
 If you are not sure if you are visiting a puppy mill or not, ask to see the mother. A reputable breeder will be happy to introduce you to the mother and other litter mates. They'll also give you a full rundown of the parents' history. A puppy mill however, will make any excuse they can (and it may sound plausible) to prevent you seeing the mother.

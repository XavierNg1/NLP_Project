 Whole grains are important in the prevention of heart disease, constipation, obesity, and other health problems. Bran, oat, wheat, and granola breakfast cereals typically have more whole grains, fiber, and other important ingredients than their over-processed counterparts. The first and second items listed in the ingredients should be whole grains – specifically with the word “whole” written in front of each grain.


Get a cereal that contains at least 16 grams of whole grains per serving.If the cereal is made of rice or flour, that’s probably a refined grain, not a whole grain. Avoid these.
Don’t be fooled by the front of the box, even if it says “made with whole grains.” The only way to get the facts is to check the ingredients. If a grain isn’t listed as “whole,” it’s probably refined.
If bran, fruit, soy, or nuts are in the first one to two ingredients, that’s okay as long as a whole grain is listed as well.
 Fiber should be included in the form of whole grains, which is the type of fiber that has health benefits. “Isolated” fiber, fiber removed from grains and made into powder, is sometimes added to cereal so that manufacturers can claim fiber content – but this kind of fiber might not have any health benefits. Watch out for “high fiber” claims if the ingredients don’t include whole grains, or if the cereal includes oat fiber, corn fiber, or soy fiber.Look for cereals that contain at least 5 grams of fiber per serving., Many healthy cereals will contain additional nutrients that can make them an important part of a morning routine for a healthy lifestyle. Fortified cereals should contain between 10-25% of the Daily Value for minerals and vitamins, as listed in the nutrition information. Look for cereal high in iron, folate, B6, B12, and other nutrients.Fortified cereals are especially useful for those who do not take a multi-vitamin or mineral supplement.

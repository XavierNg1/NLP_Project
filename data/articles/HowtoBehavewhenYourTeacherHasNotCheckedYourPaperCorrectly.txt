 Check with your friends to see what they got. If they had the same answer marked correctly, you have a chance. You'll look like an idiot to the teacher if it turns out that you actually got it wrong.;
, When you approach your teacher, don't be cocky or try to embarrass him/her. Walk up to her before or after class, don't be a jerk, or he/she might not correct the grade for you.
 S/He'll probably be gratified that you caught his/her error. Don't hold a grudge or be a smart aleck.
 Make suggestions in between compliments. For example: "I truly enjoy your teaching and think you're great at your job...but (go on to say what s/he did wrong."

, Send an anonymous formal letter specifying the problems in the classroom. If you have to, bring this issue to the school board anonymously.

 Mix water with a few drops of mild detergent in a bowl. Place the diamond jewelry in the bowl and let it it for about 5 minutes. Remove the jewelry and use a soft-bristled toothbrush to gently scrub around the grooves of the diamond until it is clean.









Rubies and sapphires may also be cleaned using this method.
Buff the surface of brilliant gems with a soft, lint-free cloth for a quick shine.
 Using a pH neutral soap such as baby soap is gentler on pearl than dish detergent and other soaps. Make sure the pearls are secure in their setting, then gently rub them clean with a soft cloth dipped in a solution of water and baby soap.
 Gemstones like opal, lapis and many others have soft, porous surfaces that are easily damaged by soap and household cleaning techniques. Take soft gemstones to the jeweler and have them cleaned using a professional technique.

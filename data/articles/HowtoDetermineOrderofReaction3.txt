 You must know that if doubling the concentration of a reactant causes the rate to double, then that reactant is of the first order. In this case, both reactants are first order. The sum of two first order reactants is a second order reaction., If changing the concentration of a reactant produces no change in rate, that reactant is said to be of the zeroth order. In this case, both reactants are of the zeroth order. Reacting two zeroth order reactions gives you an overall reaction order of zero., The reactant that impacts the reaction rate is of the second order. The second reactant has no impact on rate and is of the zeroth order. The sum of orders is two, thus this is a second order reaction.

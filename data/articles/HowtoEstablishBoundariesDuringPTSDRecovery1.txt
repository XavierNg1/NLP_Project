 Throughout your recovery, make sure you and your therapist are on the same page about your expectations and goals. Check in regularly to discuss your progress. Bring up any issues you want to focus on in upcoming sessions, and make it clear if you don’t feel ready to work on certain issues yet.For instance, you might say, "I'm not yet ready to talk about some parts of my trauma. Can you be patient with me while I build up my nerve? I'd really appreciate it."
Your therapist should respond positively to any hesitation you have about certain issues. Don’t let a fear of how your therapist might react prevent you from speaking up.;
, Let your therapist know if something isn’t working for you. Don’t feel obligated to go along with a type of treatment that makes you feel threatened or scared.For instance, if exposure therapy is going too quickly for you, tell your therapist you need to slow down. Say, "This is a bit too much for me right now. It's bringing up a of of upsetting memories that I'm not ready to deal with. Can we slow it down?"

, Keep your relationship with your therapist friendly, yet professional. It’s okay to like your therapist, but don’t try to initiate a personal friendship outside of therapy sessions. Respect your therapist’s boundaries as well as your own.It’s important for both you and your therapist to uphold your agreements. For instance, you should be able to count on when and where your sessions will be held.
Mutual respect and trust are the keys to a healthy therapeutic relationship.
Try not to get upset if your therapist asks you to change something about their interactions with you. They keep the same professional standards for all of their clients.

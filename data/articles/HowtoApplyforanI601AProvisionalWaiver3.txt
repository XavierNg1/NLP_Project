 The most common reason for a rejected application is improperly filling out a portion of the Form. If this happens to you, USCIS will return the application along with your filing fee and the reason for the rejection.If your application is denied rather than rejected, your fee won’t be refunded and you will be forced to leave the country.
 Alternatively, they may reject an application for lack of evidence. If this is the case, they will request an in-person interview and tell you what further evidence they require. Show up to the interview dressed well. Intangible factors like “good character” are legally valid reasons to grant a waiver, so you don’t want to make a poor impression.
 If your application is denied, there is no appeal process. The only way to re-enter the country is by filing Form I-601 at a foreign embassy or consulate. You can find the location of the closest embassy or consulate at https://www.usembassy.gov/.

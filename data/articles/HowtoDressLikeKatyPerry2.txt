 Shoes are a big part of Katy's wardrobe so be sure they stand out.You will need to look for bright-colored shoes that will match your bright-colored outfits. Focus on anything with glitter, bows, straps, or even some studs.
 Katy will wear anything from ankle boots to over the knee boots, depending on the outfit.


Motorcycle boots will fit well with a lot of the pinup style dresses.
Look for shiny, bright colors to match your outfit. Glitters, bows and patterns are all good too.
 Whether you are going with boots, pumps or sandals, look for platforms. Katy is a big fan of platforms and wears them with most outfits. They give you a bit more height and can be more comfortable to wear.

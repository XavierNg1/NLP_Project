 But don't actually choke them! Just grasp right under their jaw-bone hard enough to keep your grip.;
, Remember wrestling isn't all real they put there arm like that so the opponent can help them grip them. Make sure to grab hold of your opponent's pants or trunks with your stronger free hand, as doing so would give greater leverage (This has been tested on a struggling opponent, so its quite effective). Tug your opponent upward to ready your opponent to jump. With the arm that's holding them, move your hand downward to build momentum and tug on our opponents pants/trunks.
 Once they're in the air, place your hand on your opponent's lower back to guide it so it hits the ground back first. (This is called take a back bump - this is when you land flat on your back to make your opponent seem stronger).

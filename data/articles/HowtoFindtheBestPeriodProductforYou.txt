 In this case, a tampon gives you the freedom to do any activity such as swimming and diving. Whereas, a pad can make you feel comfortable but it restricts you to only a few activities. A pad is made to absorb liquid from your menstrual flow so if you try to go swimming, it will end up being swelled as a balloon!


Tampons are made for people who have a slightly heavier flow. Once the tampon is inside of your vagina, it sucks up liquid making sure you have no leaks! Some tampons are designed with a leak skirt to prevent those 'oops' moments! At first, it might seem uncomfortable but you'll sooner or later get used to it.
Pads are made to feel comfortable while wearing it and it absorbs just as well as tampons. The only downside to a pad is that you can't go swimming because you'll most likely catch an infection in your vagina.
Liners can be worn everyday to feel a little more clean and fresh. It prevents leaks and protects against spotting a couple of days before and after your period. Some are so thin, you won't even realize you're wearing one!
Cups are used by some people however, they need to be emptied out more often. It is believed to be more sanitary and the anti-bacterial silicone cuts down on the health risks. Unfortunately, it's very pricey!;

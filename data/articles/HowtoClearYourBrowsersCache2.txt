If Options is not listed in the menu, click Customize and drag Options from the list of Additional Tools and Features over to the Menu.
Note: If you're using the menu bar, choose Tools and then Options instead.
 With the Options window now open, click the Privacy tab. In the History area, click the clear your recent history link.


If you don't see that link, change the Firefox will: option to Remember history. You can change it back to your custom setting when you're done. In the Clear Recent History window that appears, set the Time range to clear: to Everything. In the list at the bottom of the window, uncheck everything except for Cache.
 They will be cleared with the cache in the next step.


Don't see anything to check? Click the button next to Details. Click on the Clear Now button. When the Clear Recent History window disappears, all of the files saved (cached) from your Internet browsing activities in Firefox will have been removed.
If your Internet cache is large, Firefox may hang while it finishes removing the files. Just be patient - it will eventually finish the job.
Older versions of Firefox, particularly Firefox 4 through Firefox 33, have fairly similar processes for clearing the cache but please try to keep Firefox updated to the latest version if you can.

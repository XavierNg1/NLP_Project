 Any type of t-shirt will work, but make sure that it is big enough because it will become more form fitting after making it into a racerback.;
, Using a scissor, cut off the sleeves about 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the seam of the t-shirt.
 To make the tank top into a racerback, cut into the back of the shirt only. Start where the hole ends at the bottom and cut into the back, extending the hole and making it wider. Repeat this for the other side.
 About 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the collar, cut a straight line across the racerback.


Make sure to only cut into the back of the shirt.
 Cut the racerback into 3 horizontal strips to where the bottoms of the holes are. Then, tug on the strips to make them thinner.
 Braid the strips all the way to the top of the shirt, keeping it tight and together.
 Using a needle and thread, put a few stitches where the braid ends to hold it together.
 Attach the end of the braid underneath the center of the collar so that the stitch is hidden. Use a needle and thread and begin the stitch on the inside of the collar to attach the braid to the collar.
 Tug lightly on the braid to make sure that the stitch is intact.


Try on the shirt to make sure that the fit is right.

 If you are more comfortable on the computer, open a document and name it "Reframing My Past.";
,, This way you'll less likely be distracted. Make a nice cup of tea, coffee or pour a big glass of water to sip and savor between thoughts.
 Leave about twelve lines blank under each entry; keep the descriptions under a dozen words. Now you're ready to write how these dire times ultimately shook out. Maybe losing a job allowed you time to be home with your kids. Perhaps a breakup led to meeting the love of your life. The death of a pet may have spurred you to get involved with an animal shelter or animal foster group.
 Your list may surprise you. It may be all about simple pleasures. A hot morning shower. A roof over your head. Healthy children. Having a car. A loving family. Caring friends. Not working weekends. Unconditional love from pets.
 Reflect on what you're grateful for that day. This is a lovely way to end the day. As time goes on, a short list may grow into a longer list.
 Were they harder or easier than yours? What might they have sacrificed to give you a better life. Write ten things you appreciate about one or both of your parents.

,, Depending on the person, he/she may not be a "huggy type" of person, and so, not everyone feels comfortable giving casual hugs. You can often sense when a hug feels appropriate.
 Maybe say something like "I wanna hug!". If it's a congratulation hug, just say , "Congratulations!" and hug them.
 Hugs don't have to mean anything if you don't want them to. For some people, a hug is something you can give to someone you just met. It only feels awkward if you make it seem awkward, so be casual and cool about it.

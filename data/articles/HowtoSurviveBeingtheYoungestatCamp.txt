 Many people relate age with strength. But you can prove them you're a lot stronger than what they think. Go running, exercise and build up your strength. Most camps require some physical strength, and you want to be the first at the top of the rock when you go climbing.
 Many teens either take good care of themselves or don't even shower. Show you actually have self respect and take daily showers and groom yourself without becoming so obsessed with yourself you're plucking your eyebrows at breakfast., Don't go for the low end, dig out your favourite high end make up for the formal nights and some drug store makeup for the day. Remember your waterproof mascara!, This doesn't mean bring a fancy dress but remember basic fashion rules when you pack, don't wear denim on denim or leather on leather, don't wear patterned tops with patterned bottoms and don't wear stained clothes. Remember, surviving is also about not giving bullies a chance to have a go at you., Smile and seem happy in your own body. People will admire you for being you more than you may think., Don't be that spoilt rotten kid that never shares their sweets or items even if you can go without half of it easily. Of course don't share your toothbrush and remember your own stuff too! Good things to share are books, magazines, sweets, pen/paper to write home and games., Of course, if some one is doing something dangerous or is bullying telling a trusted adult is the best thing you can do, but if it is embarrassing such as wetting the bed, keep it to your self. No-one likes a rat.

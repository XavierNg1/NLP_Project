 It can help to have a transcript to mark up, especially if you are learning the accent for a script. You may want to listen to the recording several times to pick up the specific sounds. You may only concentrate on the ‘s’ in one listening or you may focus on the vowels in another listening., Cadence, or the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables, affects the way an accent sounds as much as the individual letters. Without the right cadence, you may sound like someone from a completely different area. Take Tom Kaine’s impression of Donald Trump—he sounds nothing like Trump's New York accent., Tone can affect the way a sentence sounds as well.

 Shoot by yourself and really focus on your technique. Take shots from different angles around the post. Focus on the quality of the shots you are taking and not the number of shots. Evaluate each shot and ask yourself some questions:Did I flick my hand at the end of my shot?
Did my elbows touch my ears throughout my shot?
Did I bend my knees?
Did I keep my arms stretched above my head?
Did I release the ball above my head?, It is much easier to shoot when you have no one defending you. However, this is an unlikely scenario when you are playing a game. Have a partner defend you as you practice your shooting. Practicing with a defender in front of you will simulate game pressure and teach you to shoot the ball over the defender.


Ask your partner to point out any mistakes in your technique during this drill.This drill can help you build confidence in your shooting abilities.
 Your technique may suffer when you become tired. Incorporating cardio into shooting practice will help you build endurance and stamina. Place a ball anywhere in the semicircle. Sprint to the sideline, sprint back to the ball, pick up the ball, and then shoot. Try to get in 10 shots as fast as you can.You will need a partner to retrieve balls for you during this drill. Your partner should place the ball in a different spot in the semi-circle each time.Focus more on your technique as you become tired.

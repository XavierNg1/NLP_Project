 If you work with someone who annoys you, it may be difficult to ignore them, especially if you're on a team together. However, one way you can get out of spending time with the person is to put the blame on the work you need to get done.For instance, you could say, "I'd love to chat, but I really need to finish this project."

, Whether you're being bullied at school or someone at work is affecting your productivity, you can and should speak out. At school, talk to an adult. At work, it's a bit more difficult, but try to address the situation with your boss, focusing on how it is affecting the work environment instead of the person's flaws., If you are at all in fear for your safety, especially if you are being bullied, try to keep a buddy with you. It's much harder for someone to attack or bully you if you're in a group., Ignoring someone who annoys you is different than bad mouthing someone who annoys you. If you want to ignore someone, then follow the maxim "out of sight, out of mind." Don't resort to calling someone names, or being rude in return.When you see someone who annoys you, don't make a big deal about it. Don't talk about them in an attempt to get them to leave you alone. Just keep going about your business, and don't think about that person.

 Slapping it on in the morning and rushing out the door won't give your makeup time to set. After each layer you apply, wait five minutes before applying the next one. This will go a long way toward helping your makeup stay in place all day long.
 Every time you touch your face, you're removing a little bit of makeup and increasing the chances it'll get smudged. Avoiding touching your face with your fingers as much as possible.
 When it's hot outside, wearing a ton of makeup is never a good idea. As you perspire, your makeup will naturally come off a lot more easily. The best thing to do is wear waterproof eye makeup and go easy on the foundation, rather than fighting to keep it in place all day long.
 Having your hair brush against your face all day long is a sure way to take off your makeup a little faster. When it's essential for your makeup to stay set all day, go for an updo style that day.

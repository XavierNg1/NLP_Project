 Make sure you check prices through multiple different sources. Furthermore, consider multiple different resorts, as well as multiple destinations. Use travel sites like Expedia, Travelocity, and Priceline, which can help you find vacation deals that include airfare.Even if your initial thought is to stay in the Caribbean, it’s worth checking prices for resorts in another location, such as Mexico.
Note that prices may vary widely, even between resorts that are located in the same general destination.
 Even if your deal doesn’t include airfare, bundling flights with the hotel often results in an additional discount to your overall costs. Be sure to check prices for flights on their own too, to determine whether it may actually be cheaper to book separately.Travel agents can also help you find package deals that include not only your stay at the resort, but your flight and travel to and from the airport to the resort.
While package deals aren't necessarily the cheapest option, it's always worth checking to see what's available through several different avenues. At the very least, call resorts directly and ask about any deals they offer.
 Flexibility in terms of scheduling can help you find the best price. For instance, mid-week arrivals and departures will likely be less expensive than weekends options.Likewise, trips outside of peak vacation season will be cheaper as well. Avoid spring break and summer weekend dates.
If you have lots of flexibility regarding your schedule, search for a sale. Many resorts will offer especially good prices during certain times of the year.

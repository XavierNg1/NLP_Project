 Sketch a curvy trapezoid (as shown) and add guidelines for facial features.;
, Draw smaller ovals for the pupils

, Draw two curved lines that approach each other as you get farther away from his face. Don't make it too long, then add two small circles at the end and don't forget to give him a smile!

, This should be just a bit bigger than his head. Add ovals for the legs and squares for the feet. Give him a little tail.
 These should be almost as big as his body.
 Use grey for his body and pastels for his ears and eyes (light colors since he's only a baby elephant).

 You can reduce the seriousness of a paw pad injury by checking your dog for any signs of an injury daily. You should examine your dog’s paws every time it comes in from the outside. In addition, check your dog’s paws for injuries before taking it out on a hunting trip. The type of injury your dog has will determine what kind of treatment it needs., When you are checking your dog’s feet for injuries, make sure you check the entire foot closely, looking for any red, irritated areas, lacerations, objects stuck in its feet or in between its toes and paw pads, and cracked or blistered paw pads., In addition, push firmly on your dog’s paw pads to determine if your dog is feeling any discomfort that is not visible. Discomfort when you do this can indicate your dog has a bruised paw pad. It can also indicate a puncture wound that is covered over and infected. If the pad feels hot or your dog has a temperature, this may be an infection, not a bruise., Also check your dog’s nails for any signs of infection. Look carefully to identify any discoloration in the nails (like a white nail with a brown center), and swelling or redness where the nail goes into your dog’s toe., If your dog is limping, this is a good indication it has some kind of injury. If you notice your dog is not using one of its legs, or is using it very gingerly, inspect that leg, including the paw and paw pads., Another indication that your dog may have a paw pad injury is if it is licking, chewing, or biting at its paws more than normal. If you notice your dog doing this, give it a thorough examination of its paws.

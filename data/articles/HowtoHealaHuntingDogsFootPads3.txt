 There can be numerous causes of cracked or irritated paw pads, so you should take your dog to the vet if you notice it has this type of injury. Your vet can help you determine the cause of the irritation by first ruling out any health disorders, like allergies, and can recommend the best way to treat it.


If it is determined that the drying and cracking is due to contact irritants or food allergies, you should do your best to avoid walking your dog through these irritants and remove the items your dog is allergic to from its diet., If you’ve determined your dog’s cracked paw pads are not the result of a larger health problem, you can treat them at home. Antibacterial creams and ointments are better absorbed after soaking your dog’s foot in warm water for a few minutes. To do so, fill a small tub with warm water and completely submerge the affected foot or feet for several minutes., After soaking your dog’s foot, apply ointments like Vaseline or Neosporin to help soften the pad and keep away infection. Make sure you apply the ointment to the entire pad and rub it in well., To keep your dog from licking off the ointment, place a clean sock or bandage on your dog’s foot after you’ve applied the cream. You can use gauze to bandage the foot from the joint above your dog’s ankle, down and around the entire paw pad, and back up the leg.


Keep the sock or bandage on for several hours so the ointment can be absorbed into your dog’s paw pads. Continue to do this until your dog’s pads are back to normal and no longer cracked or excessively dry.

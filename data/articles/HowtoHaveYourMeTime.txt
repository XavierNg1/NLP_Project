 "Me" time should not be thought of as selfish or wasting time––it is your window to reduced stress levels. Regarding yourself as important can revitalize you more than you can imagine.


Guilt pays a big part in your inability to take time for yourself. However, by having a small pocket of time to just exist whatever your chosen activity is, is not a thing to feel guilty about. It will make you think clearer, achieve more, be calmer and this will have a knock-on effect to everything in your life, in a positive way.

, No matter how busy your day/week is, there will always be opportunities to fit in some me time. If an opportunity arises where you can fit in a leisurely activity or to take a quick nap, do not pass it up.
 Whether it's a game of your favorite sport, a massage, or even gym time, set aside a time to do that activity.
 While it may be easy to give up your time for someone else, you have to remember that you're important also. Consider rescheduling either your time or holding off what you need to do until later.
 You're now going to work out what you'd like to do in your "me" time. Sit down somewhere peaceful. For example, a beach, cafe, your room, or anywhere else where you feel peace and enjoyment.


Ask yourself "What do I want to do?". It may be that you like painting and reading but there is a wide variety of relaxation activities you may enjoy. Some people love running on the treadmill or going for a long walks.
Other things that you might like to do include reading or writing poems, cooking, shopping, practicing yoga, playing with kids, etc.
 Schedule it for your "me time".
 Slowly introduce the "me" time activities more than once a week. Have a mixture of short and longer activities, depending on the amount of time available to you.
 Slowly, as you perform the "me" time activities, your happiness quotient will increase.
 This way the "me" time will help you to feel good about yourself and contribute to building a happier you.

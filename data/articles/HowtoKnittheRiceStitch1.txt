 To get started, you will need to cast on a multiple of two plus one stitches.For example, you could cast on 20 stitches and then add one more for a total of 21 stitches.
Count your stitches as you cast on to be sure.;
, After you finish casting on your stitches, you can begin working the first row. The first row starts with a purl stitch.To purl, insert the needle into the stitch going towards the front so that the left needle ends up in front of the right needle. Then, loop the yarn over and pull through. As you pull through, slide the stitch off of the left needle and allow the new stitch to slide onto the right needle., Follow the purl stitch with a knit stitch. However, work this stitch into the back loop of the stitch.To knit, insert the right needle towards the back of your work going through the back loop of the stitch. Then, yarn over and pull through the loop. Let the stitch slide off of the left needle and the new stitch to slide onto the right needle., Continue to alternate between purling one stitch and knitting one stitch all the way to the end of the row., Your second row will be all knit stitches. Knit all of the stitches in this row as usual. You will repeat this for every even row., After you have completed your second row, return to the pattern for the first row. Then, repeat row two again.Continue repeating rows one and two until your project is finished.

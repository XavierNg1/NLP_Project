 The prerequisite for this method is that your computer needs to have the most updated Java version already installed. If you don’t have this, go to the official Java download page, and download the recommended version of Java for your computer.
 Download One-Click Unbrick here. This will download the compressed folder named “OneClick.”


Extract the OneClick files by right-clicking on the downloaded folder and selecting “Extract to OneClick\” from the menu. A new “One Click” unzipped folder will be created.
 First copy the “OneClick.jar” file that you downloaded, and paste it into the OneClick\heimdalloneclick\resources\HeimdallPackage folder.


Right-click the “oneclickloader.exe” file in the HeimdallPackage folder, and choose “Run as Administrator.” Let the installation of Heimdall proceed.
On completion of the Heimdall installation, the OneClick Unbrick interface will appear. You are now set to try to unbrick your Android device.
 Take the USB cable that came with your Android device. Plug the smaller end into the Android, and the larger end into a vacant USB port on your computer.
 As soon as your computer detects your Android device, OneClick Unbrick will display a “Unsoft Brick” button, allowing you to recover your phone with a single click.


You will see on the screen the progress, and after the process is 100% complete, a notification will appear. You can then disconnect your device and switch it on.

 From the Pokecenter in the middle of town, head up to the upper right, skirting through the small "maze" of rocks to reach the cave just northeast of town., The Sky Pillar is a small stage, with two doors on the top of the screen. Use them to move up to the top layer. Whenever you see cracks on the floor, use the Mach Bike to quickly skate over them without stopping. You'll fall through if you try to walk or stop.


The Sky Pillar stages are filled with strong Pokemon, but they can be avoided if you use a Max Repel. This is a good way to save your Pokemon's HP for the big battle with Rayquaza later.
 You only get one chance to catch Rayquaza, so you need to make sure you save in case you fail the first time. If he escapes, defeats you, or faints, you're out of luck. That is, unless you can re-load the save right before the fight., Moves like "False Swipe" and "Tackle" are good for dealing only a little damage at a time, preventing you from accidentally knocking him out and never catching Rayquaza.


If you're throwing the Master Ball, toss it out on the very first turn. It will capture Rayquaza automatically for you!

, Throw down one of these Status Affecting moves, then just start chucking. Ultra Balls, even when they fail, make the next ball more likely to succeed. Even if the first few don't work, don't feel like you need to weaken the monster even more. Keep it asleep or frozen and just keep throwing Ultra Balls until it is yours.

 Hot water has been known to loosen various styles of lids. Be careful when heating and applying hot water to your lid.Use a towel if the cap is too hot to grip.
Do not make the water too hot and run it over the cap for too long. This could potentially melt the cap or damage the bottle.
 Firmly hold the bottle of water in your hand and hit the cap against a hard surface.You can hit the cap pretty hard and you shouldn't have to worry about the bottle exploding. On cheaper bottles, it can explode easier.
 See if your friend or neighbor can loosen the cap for you. It could hurt your pride, but if they can open the bottle, it should be worth it.

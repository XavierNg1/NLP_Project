 You can cut the cake into half or thirds for a start and use creativity on how small you want the pieces to be. Each piece represents a block.
 Make them look like stacking blocks that have been dropped on the tray; they don't have to line up perfectly!

, Choose a different color for each cake block. Use a frosting knife to spread a thin layer of frosting to cover each block. Place the tray of blocks in the refrigerator while you prepare the marshmallows.
 The marshmallow halves will make up the nodes on the blocks. Make enough marshmallow halves so that the square cake pieces each get 4 halves, the big rectangles get 6, and the small rectangles get 2., Remove the cake blocks from the refrigerator. Take a marshmallow half and spread a thin layer of icing coordinated with the frosting color of the cake block you're decorating. For example, if you're working with a cake block you frosted in blue, use blue frosting on the marshmallow half. Continuing in this way, place the marshmallow halves in even rows on the cake blocks so that each block has the correct number of halves.
 Use the rest of the frosting to spread another layer over the cake blocks, this time covering the marshmallows as well. Continue until all of the cake blocks have been neatly frosted.,,

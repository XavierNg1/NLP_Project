 This makeshift whisk will make a big mess if you don’t have a large enough bowl. Make sure your mixture is in a bowl much larger than its volume. Chopsticks are less unlikely to damage your container, but be aware of your whisking so that you don’t scrape the bottom and ruin your container., Chopsticks are a great choice because they often come connected, saving you the step of taping them together. You’ll want to use the ends that have some separation in between them to get the most out of your whisk.


The disadvantage of using chopsticks is that they don’t add as much air to your mixture as a traditional whisk or a makeshift fork whisk would.
 Take your chopsticks as-is and place the separated end in the mixture. Use your wrist to make fast, circular motions and thoroughly combine your mixture. Continue to whisk until the lumps have been eliminated.

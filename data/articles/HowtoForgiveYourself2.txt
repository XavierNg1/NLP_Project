 You may want to forgive yourself because of actions against another. You must first realize that you are not to blame for other people’s actions. We all make mistakes and we all have times in our life that we do not act our best. Realizing this may be the step you need to being the self-healing process.
 Learning from past mistakes is good, but dwelling on them can stunt self-forgiveness. It may stop you from being aware of present realities. Your life may become stagnant as you find yourself obsessing about what you did or did not do. Instead, focus on the present and what you can do in the future to make a better life for yourself.
 Consider a “fix it and move on” approach to life. If you experience a similar encounter that caused you emotional turmoil in the past, focus on what you can control.


Try and fix the issues that you know you can handle and try and let the rest of it go. You do not want to keep repeating the same mistakes. , Self-awareness of present actions can help for future healing. If you cultivate a strong sense of self and accept the actions you choose to take now, it will help you to build a better future and help you forgive past actions or reactions.
 You do not want to dwell on mistakes, but you must learn from them to move forward in a healthier way.


One way to forgive yourself is to identify the trigger, or cause, of emotions in the first place. If you identify what you did in the first place, then you can change your outlook for the future.
Ask yourself: “What did I do the first time, and what may I do to avoid the same outcome?” , This will help you directly pinpoint situations in which you feel uncomfortable. Once you’ve identified the situation, you can more easily plot out a solution. Ask yourself:


Do I feel anxious or guilty when I approach my boss?
Do I feel strong negative emotions when I talk with my significant other.
Does spending time with my parents make me feel angry or upset?

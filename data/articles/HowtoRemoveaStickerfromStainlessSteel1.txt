 You might not be able to do this in all circumstances, such as when trying to get a sticker off a fridge. But if you’re working on a table or countertop, you’ll want to make sure to prevent spillage, as oil can stain some surfaces.;
, This will prevent the oil from spilling. Be careful when placing the surface flat. If it’s an appliance, such as a toaster, you’ll want to make sure it’s not balanced on a protruding piece. If balanced in such a way, it might shift as you work and cause a spill.
 You don’t want your material entirely soaked through, only enough to allow for a good spread of oil.You can use a cloth or a paper towel. If you use a paper towel, you’ll want to fold it over a few times to ensure proper absorbency.
 Make sure to cover the sticker thoroughly. It’s especially important for the oil to seep in at the sticker’s edges, where the adhesive is strongest. Allow the oil to sit on the sticker for a few minutes; no more than five. The time should depend upon the size and strength of the sticker., The seeping oil will have dislodged the sticker and its adhesive. You should now be able to rub the sticker away.Follow the "grain" of the shine on the stainless steel. If you do not wipe with the grain, you can damage the surface's finish.


To find the grain, angle the steel away from you until it catches the light. You should then see vertical or horizontal lines shining. Follow them when you wipe.
 Wait for five minutes, then wipe again with the oil-covered cloth. This should only be needed for particularly tenacious stickers.
 The oil will allow you to easily remove fingerprints and other marks.Make sure to wipe with the grain, this will make the process much easier.

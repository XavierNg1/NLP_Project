 Thankfully, head lice are not very mobile. They cannot jump and cannot survive for long off of a human head. The most common way that they spread is through direct head-to-head contact.This might take place at school, while playing sports, or during sleepovers for children. For adults, it might be through contact with an infested loved one.
 Lice cannot feed if they are not on a human head and will starve to death in one to two days. But it still helps to be cautious. Avoid objects that could harbor live lice or their eggs.This includes hats, hair ties, barrettes, scarves, coats, and uniforms. Do not share these objects, either, or combs, brushes, and towels.
Soak all combs, brushes, and towels in water hotter than 130°F (54°C) for 10 minutes in order to disinfect.
 Used bedding, pillows, stuffed animals, or towels can be laundered in hot water and dried on high heat to effectively kill the insects. Again, make sure that the water is hotter than 130°F (54°C). If clothes cannot be washed or dried using high heat, take them to the dry cleaner or seal them in a plastic bag for two weeks.
 You or another infested person may have dropped live lice or eggs on surfaces in your home, like the couches or carpets. If possible, use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to ensure that any nits are absorbed during the vacuum process.


Lice or nits on such surfaces will not be viable for long and probably won’t spread. Still, it is a good precaution to clean them up as soon as possible.
 Fumigants and other harsh chemicals are not necessary to eradicate fleas and nits. The potential danger of inhaling or coming into contact with a strong chemical may be worse than the upside.Even if chemical remedies are available, be aware that overuse in the past few decades has caused their effectiveness to decline. The insects have in many cases built up an immunity to them.

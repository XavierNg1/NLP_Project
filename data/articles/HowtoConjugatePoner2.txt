 In Spanish, there are two different tenses used for talking about actions that occurred in the past. Use imperfect tense if you're talking about something you used to do (continually or habitually). You need the preterite tense if you're talking about something that is done, meaning the action occurred entirely in the past.Poner is regular in the imperfect tense, but irregular in the preterite tense.
 If you want to talk about the continual past action of putting something somewhere, you would use the imperfect tense. Drop the -er ending and add the same ending to the verb stem (pon-) as you would for regular -er verbs.Yo ponía (I used to put)
Tú ponías (you used to put)
Él/ella/usted ponía (he/she/you used to put)
Nosotros/as poníamos (we used to put)
Vosotros/as poníais (you all used to put)
Ellos/ellas/ustedes ponían (they/you all used to put)

, If you're talking about an action that began and ended in the past, you want to use the preterite tense. The verb "poner" is highly irregular in the preterite sense.Yo puse (I put)
Tú pusiste (you put)
Él/ella/usted puso (he/she/you put)
Nosotros/as pusimos (we put)
Vosotros/as pusisteis (you all put)
Ellos/ellas/ustedes pusieron (they/you all put)

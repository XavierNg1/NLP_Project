 If budgeting, stay on Khao San Road, for the cheapest guest houses.;
, If going to tourist areas, avoid overpriced items and scammers. Watch out for tuktuks: red, open windowed small taxis. Negotiate a price before getting in these!

, Enjoy the sun and get a tan! Try to venture to the great beaches in Thailand: Krabi, Patong and many more. Your hotel may give you some great advice, and may have tours. Another amazing island to go to is Koh Samui...Llamai beach for night life and Maenam for a quiet nice time with loved ones.
 A great day out!

, A great show with beautiful dancing and grand food! This is a must see in Phuket! A++++!!!!

, If you like wild nightlife and like to indulge, then Patong Beach is the place. Bangla Road is a great choice of bars and nightlife, but watch out for those bar girls! Some will try to scam you and milk you for a long time following your visit! If you are looking for a more secluded, sedate nightlife, try places such as Krabi or Phi Phi Islands.
 Riding on automatic controlled quad bikes, through mountains, gives a feeling you never thought possible! A driver and passenger can go on these bikes, so this is a great day for the whole family!

,, Tiger Restaurant is a great place in Patong Phuket. Venture out, and don't be afraid to try new places!

, Pancakes are delicious with over 20 varieties! And at such a cheap price, as low as 25 baht! Chocolate pancakes melted with banana are the best!

, But be warned, some sellers do try to over-charge, so get out your bargaining boots and wear them out!

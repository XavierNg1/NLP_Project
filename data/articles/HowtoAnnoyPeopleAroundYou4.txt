 This is a sure-fire way to annoy them. Your parents work hard for their money and not taking their hard work seriously is not only disrespectful, but it's extremely annoying. Here are some ways to really drive the point home:


Talk loudly about the frivolous things you have spent their money on, like designer clothes or expensive meals.
If you're way too old to be spending your parents' money, pretend like you're only ten years old. Keep asking your parents for your allowance money and ask them why they don't support you more.
If you're old enough to work a real job but just don't feel like it, keep saying, "I'm an artist, okay? I am above the rules." If they insist that it's your duty as an adult to have gainful employment, cry, "You're trying to crush my soul!"

, This will really annoy your parents. Chances are, they've done nothing but try to make your life as easy as possible. Here are some other ways to be incredibly annoying in this fashion:


Loudly say, "I didn't ask to be born, okay?"
If they nicely ask you to do something small like take out the trash, say, "Why are you doing this to me?"

, Your parents have made rules for a reason and nothing is more annoying than disregarding them completely. Showing a complete and utter lack of respect for the way their household works is incredibly annoying. Here are some ways to really drive the point home:


Act completely oblivious about your chores. If they ask you why you haven't done the dishes or cleaned up in the living room say, "Who, me?"
When they ask you to clean up your own mess, say, "What am I, a slave?"
Bring home annoying people at annoying times. Bring your new creepy boyfriend home during your dad's birthday dinner.
Throw parties without asking your parents. This will be most effective on a weeknight.

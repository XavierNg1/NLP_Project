 Once your ears have healed, which will take six to nine weeks, you can swap out your starter earrings. Wear post-style earrings for the first six months to ensure that your piercing hole won't stretch out from heavy earrings. After six months, you can wear hoops and dangling earrings.


When you change earrings, take note of your ear's reactions to different metals. Some people are sensitive to metals other than gold, sterling silver.
Platinum is another good hypoallergenic choice for those with skin sensitivities or allergies.

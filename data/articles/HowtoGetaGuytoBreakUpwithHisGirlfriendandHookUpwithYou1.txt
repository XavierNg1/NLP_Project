 Try to talk to him more than he talks to his girlfriend. If he talks to his girlfriend once a week, then text/talk to him every 2 days. Keep the juices flowing and don't bore him. But don't become too obsessive with him or he might feel like he's being suffocated.;
, If he brings her up, Let him know you don't want to talk about her by quickly, yet smoothly changing the subject. Don't say things like that they are cute together or that they make a great couple. You will just make him think you aren't interested and that you are okay with them dating.

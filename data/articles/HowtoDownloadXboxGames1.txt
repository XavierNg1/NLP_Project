 Games will be organized into a variety of categories, or you can search for a specific title.


There are a bunch of free demos available on the Xbox 360 that you can download without a credit card, as well as some free-to-play games (though these aren't sorted into a free-to-play category).
If you have an Xbox Live Gold account, there will be free games available for you to download each month.
 If you don't have enough money in your Xbox Live account wallet (from redeeming a card), you'll be asked to select a payment method.


The available payment method varies depending on your region.
If you've previously purchased the game, you can begin downloading it immediately.
 Your Xbox 360 will download one title at a time if you have multiple games queued.Games range in size from a few hundred megabytes to tens of gigabytes, so the time it takes to download will depend on the game.

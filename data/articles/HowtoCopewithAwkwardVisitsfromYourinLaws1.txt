 For a successful visit, you and your spouse must be on the same page. As the visit is being planned, discuss all of the arrangements with your spouse. Also, talk about which aspects of your life your in-laws are and are not welcome to be involved., If your in-laws live far away, they are going to need a place to sleep. Make space in a spare bedroom, or turn another room into a temporary bedroom. If you’d prefer your in-laws stay somewhere else, help point them in the direction of comfortable, reasonably priced lodging.To ease the tension of suggesting lodging, offer to pay for some or all of it if your finances allow.
 You and your spouse need to agree ahead of time what involvement the in-laws can have in your daily life. Consider boundaries on things such as child rearing, housekeeping, and family decisions. Come to an arrangement that works for both of you and leaves you feeling comfortable and at ease with the impending visit.For example, it might be unacceptable for your in-laws to feed the kids junk food before dinner. Make this boundary known.
 If you know you’ll need a break from the visit, plan to do some tasks during the visit. You can arrange to run errands, take important calls, or attend a class or meeting during the visit. Be careful not to overdo it, though. Staying away for the entire visit would likely be seen as rude.Plan ahead with your spouse so that you each get a break from the pressure of entertaining your in-laws. You should each know when the breaks are planned to occur and what the other spouse plans to do with your in-laws.
 Instead of giving yourself a break, you can also consider giving your in-laws a break. Book local entertainment for them, or recommend a great restaurant. This will give you some space from the visit, and be seen as a kind gesture by your in-laws.

 Salutations are words like "Hi" and "Hello." These are simple sayings used right when you meet someone. There are many salutations in French (just like in English). Below are a few of the most common (with pronunciation guides):



Bonjour (Hello/Good day): Bohn-zhoou. The "zh" is pronounced like the "ge" in "deluge." The n and r are very delicate — almost silent.Bonsoir (Good evening): Bohn-swah. Here, again, the n is very delicate.

Bonne nuit (Goodnight): Bun nwee . The n isn't as delicate here.
You can use "bonjour" in nearly all situations, so it's a good one to memorize. The others are only used later in the day.;
, This is an informal greeting. It's a little like "Hi" or "Hey" in English. It's perfectly fine to use this around friends, family members, and children, but you probably won't want to use it for a new boss or professor — this can be disrespectful.



Salut (Hi ): Sah-loo. The "loo" actually uses a subtle sound that's not common in English — it's a little like "liu" with a very soft ee sound at the beginning. A good pronunciation example is here., After the salutation, you can let the other person know who you are. Again, there are a few different ways to do this (which are listed below).Only use the informal options for friends, family members, children, and so on.



Je m'appelle ______ (My name is ______): Zhuh mah-pell (your name). Again, the zh here is pronounced like the "ge" in "deluge."

Je suis ______ (I am ______): Zhuh swee (your name).

Moi c'est ______ (I'm ______ ): Mwah say (your name).
Another informal option is to simply say your name after salutations are exchanged. This is a little like saying, "Hi. Judy." (if your name's Judy) as you shake someone's hand.
 In English, when you meet someone, you usually end your introduction with "nice to meet you," "It's a pleasure," or another similar phrase. French is no different. Use the phrases below to show you're happy to make someone's acquaintance:


"Ravis de vous connaitre" (Pleased to meet you): Ra-vee deh voo con-net-tray. The French r sound is made by lifting the back part of the tongue towards the roof of the mouth. The resulting sound is more delicate and airy than the English r sound.
"Ravis de vous rencontrer" (Nice to meet you): Ra-vee deh voo ohn-con-tray. The meaning is the same as the phrase above. Note that the second r is silent.

Enchanté (Delighted): Ohn-shon-tay.If the other person says one of these first, use de même (duh meh-muh), or "same to you."

 The total betting line is also called the Over/Under Total and means that you are wagering on the total number of runs scored. An oddsmaker will establish a betting line and you must determine whether the total number of runs by both teams will be over or under this set line.For example, if the Seattle Mariners are playing the New York Yankees the line can be set at 8.5o - 130, 8.5u +110. this means that it is favoured that both teams will score over 8.5 runs. So you must bet $130 to win $100. The minus sign in front of the $130 means that it is favoured that both teams will score at least 8.5 runs.
 There are many factors to consider before placing a wager. When betting totals you must consider offensive output, pitching, stadium, and weather. Some stadiums produce more runs than others and open fields can be affected by the weather.
 Find a legal sportsbook online or a casino, pub, or other sports betting establishment. Calculate the best payout for your game before placing your bet. Some sportsbooks may offer better odds than others.
 Team totals are exactly as it sounds. Bet on the total amount of runs a single team will make in a single game rather than the total amount of runs produced by both teams. For example, Seattle may have a Team Total of 4 over - 125. So if you wager $125 that Seattle scores over 4 runs, you win $100.

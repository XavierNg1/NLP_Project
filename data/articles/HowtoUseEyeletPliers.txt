 This hole needs to be just big enough to push your eyelet through. If it is too big the eyelet will fall out.
 The pad may be: a piece of hard leather ( see next photo ), an acrylic block like the cutting boards used in kitchens, a plastic floor tile or even a sheet of paper folded many times. Make sure you keep everything in place while making the holeÂ !
, Exert strong pressure with the pliers or use a hammer to drive a hole with the eyelet punch., Do this from the right side of your material so the flat part of the eyelet is on the good side.,, The flat (good) side of your eyelet should sit in the slightly curved side of the pliers, while the tube (bad) side of the eyelet should be aligned with the "pointed" side of the pliers.,, If it can be rotated in the material you will need to repeat the previous step with a little more force until it holds the material tightly.

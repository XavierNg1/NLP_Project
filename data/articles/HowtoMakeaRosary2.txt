 Make sure they stack up on the long end of the knot, and that there's no chance they'll be able to slip over to the other side. Tie a second knot at the end of the string of beads.


Leave a little space for the beads to slide, but not too much. When the rosary is used, the person using it should be able to slide the beads down slightly once each prayer is complete.
If you need help tying a knot in a certain place, try this trick: make a loose knot over the spot where you want to tighten it. Place a toothpick on the cord in the spot where the knot should go, then pull it tight and remove the toothpick., This bead should be a different color from the ten Hail Mary beads you have already strung. Tie another knot directly after the Our Father bead.
 After tying a knot after the first Our Father bead, string 10 more Hail Mary beads. Tie a knot, string an our Father bead, tie another knot, and string 10 more Hail Mary beads. Continue until you've strung all 5 decades with the exception of the final Our Father bead. Finish with a knot after the last set of 10 Hail Mary beads.

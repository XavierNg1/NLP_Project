 You can get one at Tom Nook's store for a reasonable price! Put it anywhere in your house, if you would like.;
, You can find something at Able Sisters or create your own Christmas look yourself!

, Write a letter to each one of your neighbors! Make sure you say Merry Christmas!

, When you get letters back from them, make sure you put your gift in one of your dressers and don't open it till Christmas day! Even the one from your mom needs to be opened on Christmas day!

, Ask him for an early present and he should give you either furniture or wallpaper or carpet. Dress in many different outfits to get more furniture from him. If you don't change into different outfits, he will not give you another gift and he will say you are selfish. If you want to, go ahead and wait till Christmas day to open his present(s) too! This step is optional, but very cool!

 Start by crocheting a simple chain of 12 stitches. This will be the foundation for your practice piece.You can use any size needle with an appropriate weight yarn to practice the crunch stitch.


If you have a project in mind that you would like to try, then you can use the patternâ€™s suggestions or your own calculations for how many to chain.;
, To begin working the crunch stitch, start by counting to third stitch from the hook (stitch on the hook counts as one) and then slipstitch into this stitch.To slipstitch, simply insert the hook through the third stitch and then loop the free end of your yarn around the hook and pull this new yarn through both stitches that are on the hook., Follow the slipstitch with a half-double crochet stitch.The half-double crochet stitch is a bit more complex than a slipstitch, but it is easy after you do it a few times.


To do an HDC stitch, loop the yarn over the hook, then insert the hook through the next stitch. Then, loop the yarn over the hook again and pull through the first loop. Then, loop the yarn over again and pull the hook through all three stitches that are on the hook., After the HDC stitch, follow with a slipstitch. Continue to alternate between slipstitch and HDC to the end of the row., After you reach the end of the row, turn the stitches and chain two new stitches with the hook. These will be your turning stitches and you will do this at the beginning of each row., Start this new row with a slipstitch into the first stitch and then follow with a half-double crochet stitch. Continue to alternate between the slipstitch and half-double crochet stitch to the end of the row.Keep working in the crunch stitch until you feel like you have gotten enough practice or until you have achieved the desired length.
Remember to turn your work and chain two at the beginning of each row.

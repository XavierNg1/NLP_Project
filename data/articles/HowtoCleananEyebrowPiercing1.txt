 Never attempt to clean a piercing without washing your hands first. Bacteria from your hands can easily rub off onto the piercing, so wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before beginning the cleaning process.Wash your hands with clean, running water and soap for 20 seconds. To keep track of time, hum the "Happy Birthday" song to yourself twice.Make sure to wash your hands completely. Do not forget to wash under your fingernails, between your fingers, and the backs of your hands.;
, Your piercer should provide you with an aftercare spray used to clean your piercing. For most sprays, you only need to mist them on your piercing three to six times a day. This minimizes the need to touch the area around your piercing, which can increase your risk for an infection.If your piercer did not provide you with an aftercare spray, buy one online or from another piercer in the area.
Use your spray as instructed on the bottle or by your piercer. If you have any questions about the spray, call your piercer.

Hold it in place for two to three minutes. This should dissolve any crust built up around the piercing.
 Soap is not a good option to clean an eyebrow piercing. It can cause irritation, especially when a piercing is fresh. Stick to sea salt and the cleaner your piercing provided.

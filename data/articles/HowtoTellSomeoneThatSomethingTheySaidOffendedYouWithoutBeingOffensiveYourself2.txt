 This is a common way that people express disapproval. Sometimes when people say something offensive, they’re hoping for a response. When you don’t give them what they want, they may register that they’ve offended you.This is different than simply pretending they didn’t say something offensive. You must actively refrain from giving the response they want.
If someone tells an offensive joke, refusing to laugh or smile shows that you don’t approve of their humor.
If some asks you a question and uses a slur or offensive language, you can opt to not answer.
 Instead of simply not responding, you can respond directly to the offensive comment. Let the person know that if they want to converse with you, they’ll have to honor your boundaries.You can say, “I’m sorry, but I can’t continue this conversation if you’re going to use that language” or “I need you to use a different tone so that I can hear what you’re saying without taking offense.”

, This is important in order to not escalate the situation. Use a measured, casual tone when expressing your boundaries. You don’t want to come off as threatening. Remember that you’re not telling them what they need to do; you’re telling them what your needs are in order for the conversation to continue.
Even if someone has said something highly offensive, becoming visibly upset will not help the situation.

 In some states, you can have points removed from your driving record if you take a driver safety course (also called a defensive driving course). You should check before signing up for a course. You might also be able to have tickets dismissed if you take a course.If you’ve received a ticket, you can ask the judge in court whether you can take a driver safety course.
Also check online. Your state’s DMV website should tell you whether you can use a driver safety course to clean up your record.
 Your state may limit who can use a defensive driving class to remove points or convictions from their records. Check with your DMV whether you are eligible.


For example, states might give you a window of time to take the course. If you wait too long, then you can’t take it.Other states might require that you elect to take the course when you pay the fine. If you don’t, then you can’t take the course.
 There are many courses offered, but you need one that your state will accept. Ask if the state keeps a list of pre-approved courses. If so, select a course from the list.Make sure the course works for your schedule. If you don’t attend, then you won’t clean up your record.
Depending on your state, you may be able to take the course online or in a classroom.Choose the best option that works for you. However, don’t assume an online class will be “easier.” You might find it harder to focus when taking a class online.
 Courses can last four to twelve hours and cover a variety of topics, including alcohol or drug abuse, traffic laws, sharing the road, and developing positive driving habits and attitudes.Make sure to get a certificate or some other proof that you have completed the course. Present your certificate to the DMV and keep a copy for your records.

, Often the instructions for putting the box together are printed on the box itself. Generally, however, you shape the box into a square by standing it upright and opening it out.


Fold the base flaps across, the lower flaps facing one another should be folded first and then the higher flaps facing each other should be folded next.
Some boxes allow you to tuck the box flaps in at the end to secure them but most removal boxes require taping, as discussed next.
 The closed flaps (base) end should be facing upwards.


Use the tape gun (loaded) to tape the base flaps up.
Place the sticky end of the tape gun on one side of the box and pull the tape back across the gap between the flap joint.
Break off the tape once it reaches the other side.
Repeat several times until the box base feels strong.
 Once packed, seal the top of the box using the tape gun again, with the same manner described above.


Sometimes it might be necessary to tape around the whole box as well, depending on the fragility, heaviness, or shape of the items packed. Use your own sense of judgment here.

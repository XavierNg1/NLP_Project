Warm up some corn tortillas in a frying pan, drop some carnitas in the middle of each tortilla, and add your preferred toppings.


Try a little shredded cheese, some fresh chopped cilantro, a few slices of avocado, some sour cream, and some salsa or pico de gallo. If you really want to maximize the heat, add some more Sriracha!

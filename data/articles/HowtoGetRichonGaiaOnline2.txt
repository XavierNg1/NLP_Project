 In case you didn't realize, this method is called "Playing the Market", and involves no real money. The reason for the name is because it involves the user-based Marketplace. There are several links to this all over the site-check under the shops tab. To begin, keep in mind that in order to make money you must lose money, so don't worry about spending your gold. First, find an item that's in your price range. Make sure that it is not a common shop item, such as anything found in the main clothing shops, but something found in any kind of rare event or Monthly Collectible letter., Once you've found your item, research it a little. This cannot take much time, unless you're willing to do long term investing, so keep a second page open to search. If it seems to be selling about one to two thousand more gold than what the price you are buying it at, pounce on the deal., Once you've obtained this, go right back around and sell it for the average buying price. You will have just made a small profit., Long term investing includes things that seem to slowly rise, such as Holiday Event items, lesser wanted Monthly Items, and certain rare events. This will not give you a quick profit, but it will give you an added item and the potential for a larger outcome in the end. During this do not forget you can still earn gold via games and posting, just not nearly as much. Sell the item you've invested in once you feel it has reached an acceptable price., After making your small profits in increments, you can jump to afford other items, instead of just the few worth 10K. Keep doing this until you have enough for the item or items that you desire. You may continue as long as you feel fit.

Sometimes your favorite item is worth the most, if you sell it, don't worry, if you succeed, you will most likely be able to buy multiples of it afterward.

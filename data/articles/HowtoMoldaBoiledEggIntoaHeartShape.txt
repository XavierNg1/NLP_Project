 An easy method of getting them firm without turning the yolks green is to place the eggs in cold water, bring it to a boil, then cover it and turn off the heat. Leave the eggs in the hot water for 15 minutes.;
,, Use a 12 x 10 inch (30cm x 25cm) piece of stiff cardboard. Score creases every two and a half inches (5cm) and fold these creases to create three V-shaped ridges. They should form a triangle tube with an extra inch (2.5cm) or so flap.

Tape a 12 inch (30cm) section of dowel (or wooden spoon handle) to the center of one of the sides of the triangle on the side that will face in toward the eggs. See the image for how it should appear.

 You have nothing to prove and nothing to lose. Kissing is a two way street and the guy is probably more nervous than you are. Take deep breaths, but don't make it too obvious that you're trying to calm yourself down., Passionate kissing can be frenzied, calm and meditative, or anywhere in between. There is an unspoken process where both parties will try to match the type of passion the other is aching for.


It helps to synchronize breathing rates., A good way to begin building sexual tension is to keep him talking. Be in a location that is secluded. Having the option to sit is an extra bonus. Just keep a conversation no matter how mundane it feels. The bleaker the conversation the higher your chances are that he's thinking about kissing you.
 A great way to signal that you're ready to kiss is to go back and forth from looking at his eyes and his lips. This will create tension that is necessary to have a truly passionate kiss. If he repeats and looks at your lips, he is ready for those kissing sparks to fly.
 There are ways of being sly about getting close to him, but you want this move to be obvious. This is another clue for him to know that you want to start kissing.It will help if your bodies are slightly touching. Even if your body contact is ever so slight, it will feel exciting.
 Try and keep the conversation going, and touch him on the thigh or his arm. Another good spot to excite and comfort him is to put your hand behind his neck. Be sure to keep your eyes fixed on his eyes, but take quick glances at his lips.
 Tilt your head slightly and move close to his face and pause right before you reach his face. You shouldn't do all the work, but initiating the kiss yourself will excite him. It isn't as popular for the girl to make the first move, but there isn't a rule book to kissing!

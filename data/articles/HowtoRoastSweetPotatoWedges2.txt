 Turn the oven on to 450 degrees F (230 C) and put a large baking sheet in the oven as it preheats.Heating the baking sheet will help the sweet potato wedges crisp up faster.
 Wash 3 medium-sized sweet potatoes and use a sharp knife to slice each of them in half lengthwise. Put the sweet potato halves into a medium-sized bowl that you can place in the microwave. Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water into the bowl and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Poke a few holes in the plastic wrap, so steam can escape. Microwave the sweet potatoes on high for 5 minutes.Cooking the sweet potato halves in the microwave before roasting them cuts down on the roasting time.
 Carefully drain the hot water out of the bowl of sweet potatoes. Place each sweet potato half on a cutting board and carefully cut away the tips of the potatoes. Discard the tips. Cut each sweet potato half into 4 wedges and return them to the bowl.Cutting the wedges into uniform pieces will ensure that they cook evenly.
 Drizzle 1 tablespoon of canola oil over the potato wedges and stir them until they're coated. Sprinkle the potatoes with 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper.You could sprinkle your favorite seasonings over the sweet potato wedges. For example, toss the wedges with curry powder or dukkah.
 Use oven mitts to carefully remove the hot baking sheet from the oven. Spray cooking spray over the pan and spread the oiled sweet potato wedges to the pan so they're in a single layer. Bake them for 18 minutes or until they turn golden brown.Serve the quick sweet potatoes immediately, so they're still a little crispy.

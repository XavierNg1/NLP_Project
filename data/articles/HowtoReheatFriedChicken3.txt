 Microwaves are a quick and convenient way of reheating many foods, but they're terrible for fried chicken. Microwaves do nothing to dry out the soggy skin of cold fried chicken as they cook it. This means that while your final product will be warm, it will generally have a soft, unappealing exterior that simply doesn't compare to the crisp skin of chicken that's been reheated properly.
 In a pinch, when you don't have any other options, you can try using a toaster oven to reheat fried chicken. However, these can often heat chicken unevenly, leaving you with a piece of meat that's hot on the outside and cold on the inside.In addition, many toaster ovens lack the heating power necessary to get that crucial, crispy texture on the outside of the meat.
 Cooking fried chicken in a skillet that isn't full of frying oil is a bad idea. It's more difficult to evenly heat the irregularly-shaped pieces of fried chicken this way, but even if you do, you risk drying out the meat as its fat leaches into the dry pan.
 A stack of paper towels can seem like a good place to cool reheated fried chicken since they can soak up some of the excess grease. However, doing this will also keep some of the pieces of chicken in direct contact with the hot, steamy mixture of the oil and liquid that's draining out of it. This moisture will rehydrate the delicious skin that you worked to get dry and crispy, undoing your hard work.

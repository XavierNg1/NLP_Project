 While some students can find story problems more complex, others will thrive when they better understand the real-world implications of learning addition. Help your child recognize three different situations that require addition:


"Result unknown" problems -- for example, if Meredith has two cars and on her birthday she receives three more, how many cars does she now have in all?
"Change unknown" problems -- for example, if Meredith has two cars, and after opening all her birthday presents she now has five cars, how many cars did she receive for her birthday?
"Start unknown" problems -- for example, if Meredith receives three cars for her birthday and now she has five, how many cars did she have to start off with?, Real-world situations will involve different parameters. Understanding how these work will help your child develop tools to solve addition story problems.


"Join" problems involve the growth of a quantity. For example, if Elizabeth bakes three cakes and Sara bakes six more, how many cakes are there altogether? "Join" problems may also ask students to solve for unknown change or start figures -- for example, if Elizabeth bakes three cakes and Elizabeth and Sara produce nine cakes in all, how many cakes did Sara bake?
"Part-part-whole" problems involve adding two static figures. For example, if there are 12 girls in the class and 10 boys, how many students are in the class altogether?
"Compare" problems" involve an unknown in a compared set of values. For example, if Geoff has seven cookies, and he has three more cookies than Laura, how many cookies does Laura have?, Reading- and writing-oriented children may especially benefit from books that incorporate addition themes.

 Set the stove on medium heat and begin breaking apart the meat with a spatula.









Put your ground beef in a frying pan that is big enough to hold all of your beef with plenty of room for the beef to be moved around.;
, A 1/4 cup (59 ml) of water per 1 lb. (.45 kg) of beef is standard. This will help with the browning process.
 Turn the chunks of beef as you go.









Ground beef will break apart easily. Constantly keep turning the beef as you cook to make sure that one section of the meat doesn't stay directly on the pan for too long, causing the meat to burn.
 Continue this process until all the meat is brown.










Pour it into a colander or gently drain all the grease and water from the meat using the spatula to prevent meat falling into the sink.
Pour the beef onto a paper towel. Gently dab the beef with another paper towel to remove excess oil and water.

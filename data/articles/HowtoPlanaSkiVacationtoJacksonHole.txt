 Keep in mind a few things while doing this: discounts will occur for 3 days skiing and more; avoid President's Week and Christmas week if possible if you are flying, the airfare gets pretty limited; plan an extra day to do a non-skiing activity-snowmobile trips to Yellowstone or the surrounding areas, dog sled excursions and snowshoe tours.;
, If you'd like to travel over a weekend, typically Thursday-Monday is the most affordable for a 4 night/3 day ski package. The airport code for Jackson Hole is JAC. Nearby airports are Idaho Falls (IDA) about 2 hours away, and Salt Lake City about 5 hours away. In the winter though, the drive from either of those airports can be very negatively affected by weather...so JAC is the best way to go.
 Jackson Hole Central Reservations has private airfare that is often the most affordable that can be found, and also has exclusively discounted lift tickets.

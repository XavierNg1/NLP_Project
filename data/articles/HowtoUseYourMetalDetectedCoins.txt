Pennies from before 1982 for their copper value
Dimes and quarters from before 1965 for their silver value
Nickels between 1942-1945
Old coins

, For large deposits, roll them in wrappers that your bank will supply.
 Get a commission-free credit at a store of your choice.
 With dimes and pennies being of similar size and metal content, check to see that your dimes only deposit registers as all dimes. With machine errors, less than 1% of dimes register as pennies, so be aware of this.
 Instead, use them for purchases or deposit or cash them at your bank

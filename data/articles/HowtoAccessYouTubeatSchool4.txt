 Since YouTube.com is blocked, search for the video through a search engine like Google. One of the first links should be a link to that video's site on YouTube.
 Copy the whole URL for the video. The URL should look like "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxxxxxxx". The Xs will be random letters and numbers.
 There are multiple websites that allow you to download YouTube videos. Search for "YouTube downloader."


Copy the URL of the video into the URL bar of the video downloader. Click the download button.
The first time you visit a site that downloads videos, you will have to run a Java script. Only do this if you trust the site. Check reviews online to see if others feel the site is safe.
It is possible that your network will not allow you to run the Java script when prompted. If this is the case, then you may not be able to download the videos at school.
 A list of download options will appear. These are the different filetypes and video qualities that you can pick from. The most widely compatible filetypes are FLV and MP4.


You may need to have a special video player program installed to view the downloaded files. A video player like VLC Player should be able to play any file you download.
The numbers followed by "P" in the download list indicate the video quality. For the best looking videos, download 480P or higher.
If you just want the audio from a video, download the MP3 version. This will not contain any video, but can be listened to on any MP3 player or computer.

 A cleanable air filter is advertised as “washable,” “permanent,” and/or “reusable.” Don’t wash paper or otherwise disposable air filters. Avoid vacuuming them as well.


Washing disposable air filters can actually clog them, as well as cause mold.
Disposable filters can tear under the pressure of vacuuming or compressed air. At a low pressure, this may work temporarily, but it’s not a long-term solution.
 Clean or change your filter every 12,000 to 15,000 miles, or more often if you travel on dusty roads or in polluted areas.Examine your air filter under a bright light. Clean or change the filter if it’s darkened or clogged with debris.Disposable filters should be replaced, whereas permanent filters can be vacuumed or washed.
If you don’t change your air filter as needed, you may notice a decrease in your gas mileage, ignition problems, or fouled spark plugs.
 Clean or change your filter every three months, and more frequently in-season. Clean or change the furnace filter monthly during the heating season.Clean or replace your central air filter every month or two in the cooling season.If your filter is disposable, replace it. If it’s reusable, you can vacuum or wash it.
More frequent changing is needed if your filter is exposed to a lot of dust or pet hair.
Failing to clean your air filters in the home can cause HVAC failure or even fire.

, All you need is a dark colored outfit that has long sleeves, long pants,and a mask. For a mask, simply cut a strip of dark colored fabric and cut eye holes. You can make an outfit like that but white if it snows a lot where you live.
 If you want to go all out, buy a real one. If you want, carve one with wood.
, Also eat fruits and veggies and lots of water or milk so you stay healthy. Feel free to drink soft drinks or take out but no more than once a week. Have no more than two cookies or pieces of candy a day and keep exercising.
 Also practice fencing or flicking playing cards (helpful for throwing ninja stars).

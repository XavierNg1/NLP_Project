 For a “safety stop,” keep your shoulders square to the ball and assume a hurtle position with one knee on the ground. You should field the ball in front of your body in an even, balanced position. Safety stops are used primarily when the runner in the infield cannot advance or in the case of a ground ball that bounces or moves unpredictably.
 Infield stops are generally considered the go-to method for fielding ground balls that don't require any special consideration. Start by squaring your shoulders to the ball while keeping your hand and glove on the ground. Keep your body low, but don’t kneel like you’re making a safety stop.


Although your shoulders should always be square to the ball, you should never run directly at it. Keep the ball in line with your glove hand in preparation for the catch.
 When making a “do or die” stop, keep your momentum going forward and round the ball so you’re in a good position to throw. Catch the ball on your glove side and scoop it up quickly. Do-or-die stops are used when the runner has the opportunity to advance and you need to make a quick throw to the infield., Being aware of plays that could be made in the infield will affect how you prepare to make the throw. For instance, when the runner cannot advance, the primary objective is to make the stop, and you don’t need to pay as much attention to rounding the ball in preparation for a throw. If the runner can advance, field the ground ball aggressively on your glove side in preparation for the throw.A good rule of thumb to follow when assessing the infield is to throw two bases ahead of the lead runner. For example, if the lead runner is at first, throw to third., Throws from the outfield need to be strong and accurate. Keep the trajectory of the ball low as you aim for your target in the infield. It’s better to make an accurate throw that bounces a couple of times than an inaccurate, airborne toss.

 You can use a cooking spray or olive oil in place of butter for a slightly lower-calorie version as well, if you desire., Place the chicken between two sheets of plastic wrap and use a meat pounder to flatten the chicken until it is roughly 1/4-inch thick. The best cordon blue is thin, allowing every bite to have nearly equal parts ham, cheese, and chicken., If you don't have a meat pounder, you can make do by cutting the thick chicken breast sandwich style. Be careful not to cut completely through the chicken.
 You can use as much as you'd like, but remember that you want to be able to "close up" the chicken around your ham and cheese as well., Roll tightly, preventing air pockets or areas where the cheese inside can easily leak out. If you filleted the chicken, simply close the top of the chicken over the inside, locking in the cheese and ham.
 Keep the rolls in place by skewering each piece with at least two toothpicks. For the "flap" method, simply use the toothpicks to ensure the chicken stays around the ham and cheese as it cooks.
 You'll need to dip the cordon bleu in both a whipped egg (beat it with a whisk or fork) and breadcrumbs before cooking. Set up the two bowls now so that you can quickly dunk everything and get them coated without mess.If you want seasonings, add them to the breadcrumbs now. Salt and pepper are key, but thyme, oregano, rosemary all taste great as well.
 You want a light coating of liquid egg around the chicken, helping the breadcrumbs stick and retaining moisture as the meat cooks.
 Use your hands to lightly press the breadcrumbs into the chicken, helping them stick. Set the chicken aside once coated with both egg and breadcrumbs.
 The outsides of the chicken should be golden brown and the inside cheese gooey. Once removed from the oven, let them cool for 3-4 minutes and serve hot.

 Keep your muscles limber by stretching them before you go about your day. Try these stretches to help your shin splints heal more quickly:


Do a stair stretch. Stand on a step or a stair so that your toes hang over the edge. Point your toes downward, then stretch them toward the ceiling. Repeat 20 times, rest for a few seconds, then repeat 20 more times.
Stretch by kneeling. Kneel with the tops of your feet flat against the floor, then slowly sit back onto your feet. You should feel your shin muscles stretching.
Stretch your Achilles tendon if you feel pain on the inside of the shin, which is most common. If you feel pain on the outside of the leg, stretch your calf muscle.
 Doing these exercises a few times a day instead of running will help heal your muscles in no time.


Trace shapes or the alphabet on the floor with your toes, while in a sitting position.
Walk on your heels for 30 seconds at a time and then switch to regular walking for another 30 seconds. Repeat 3 or 4 times.
 Increase your mileage by no more than 10 percent each week. If you feel the shin splints coming back, cut back on running until the pain goes away.

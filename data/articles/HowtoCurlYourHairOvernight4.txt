 This step will be similar to what you did for Method 3. Take one section of your hair and twist it repeatedly with your hand until it is wound as tightly as it will go into a little bun.Note: If you want tighter, smaller curls, you can divide your hair into more sections. The more sections you have, the smaller your curls will be., For this step, you can use any kind of elastic band or hair clip.

Note: Remember that you'll be sleeping with the clips in your hair. So try to clip them in locations on your head that will still allow you to sleep comfortably.
If the clips are too painful to lay on, you can use elastic bands to secure the twists or use two bobby pins in an X formation at the base of each twist.
 Twist mini buns all over your head, making sure to use all of your hair., When you wake up, take the buns out.
 This makes your hair very curly. It may come out as frizzy, so make sure to put a serum in the night before.


Try doing an updo or a high ponytail with this style.

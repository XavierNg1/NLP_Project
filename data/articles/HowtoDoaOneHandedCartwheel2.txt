 For most people, this cartwheel, which uses the same hand as your lead foot, is less stable and quite a bit trickier than the far-arm one-handed cartwheel. Make sure you have your regular cartwheel down pat, and then try the far-arm one-handed cartwheel first before moving on to this one.

Some people find this version of the one-handed cartwheel a lot easier, it really depends. So if the far-arm cartwheel isn't working for you, go ahead and give this one a try.
 You will need plenty of room to practice this cartwheel, and preferably a soft surface to work on, like a gym mat or soft patch of grass.

, Practice some regular cartwheels to remind yourself how they should feel. Then do a few far-arm one-handed cartwheels, if you already have them down.

, This will be just like a two-handed cartwheel, but you will only place your lead hand down, about 12-18 inches from your lead foot, and then step through. Focus on keeping your feet and your hand in a straight line. Do this slowly a few times to help you visualize what it's going to be like./images/thumb/d/db/Do-a-One-Handed-Cartwheel-Step-13.jpg/v4-550px-Do-a-One-Handed-Cartwheel-Step-13.jpg

How far out you place your hand depends on your height and how fast your are moving. Your hand placement for this cartwheel should be a bit closer than it was for the far-hand version.
Place a line of tape on the floor, or use a line on a gym mat as a guideline to help keep your cartwheels centered., Pick your lead foot up slightly off the ground and raise your hands in the air, as though you are about to do a regular cartwheel. Now bend your knees and prepare to plant your forward hand on the ground. If you are leading with your right foot, you will plant your right hand.

, To keep your cartwheel straight, make sure that your hand is planted perpendicular to your direction of travel, and that your fingers are facing in, pointing towards your opposite foot. So if you are starting on your right foot, plant your right hand so that your fingers are pointing off to the left.

, The more momentum you have, the easier the cartwheel will be. Resist the temptation to put your second hand down, and try to push off and land in a straight line.

, Doing a one-handed cartwheel is a lot easier when you have some speed built up, so try it a few times slowly to get the motion down, and then add in a run-up or lunge, as you would with a normal cartwheel.

, Keep practicing until your cartwheel feels and looks smooth and easy. Try leading with your left foot and your right. You'll be moving onto aerials in no time!

If you are very nervous about falling, ask someone to spot you until you build up more confidence.
If your cartwheels tend to go off to one side or the other you may not have your hand positioned correctly, or may not be lining your feet up in a straight line. Ask someone to watch you, and give you tips on your form.
 If you just can't shake the temptation to plant your second hand, you can first try doing a two-step regular cartwheel. Do a normal cartwheel, but instead of putting both hands down at the same time, plant your lead hand, pause for a second, then plant the second hand, so the footwork pattern is foot-hand-hand-foot.

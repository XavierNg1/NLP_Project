 The number 25% is mostly shorthand -- an easy way for people to compare two numbers, but it cannot be used to do much. For example, saying that 13% of your 2,566 apples are spoiled does not tell you exactly how many of them went bad, it just says that 13 out of every 100 apples is no good. To find the exact number of bad apples, you'll need to convert everything back.
 This conversion will give you a number, usually a decimal, that can be used to do your math. For example, if 13% of your apples went bad, you'd end up with .13 here.


Moving the decimal 2 places to the left is the same thing as dividing by 100.
 Here, you're looking for 13% of 2,566 apples. To get it, simply multiply .13 times 2,566. The resulting number is exactly how many apples went bad, roughly 333.58.
 To make sure you did the math right, divide your number of apples by .13. Your final answer should be 2,566. This is also how you find how many total objects you have based on a percentage. For example:


Jimmy has 20% of all the marbles in class. He has 10 marbles. How many marbles does the class have in total?

20% → .20
10 divided by .20 = 50.

The class has 50 marbles total., You find a blouse that you love for $50, but it is on sale today, 15% off. How much will the blouse cost, total?


Convert 15% into a decimal.

15% → .15, or 15/100.


Multiply this decimal by $50.

.15 times 50 = $7.50.


Subtract the discount from the initial price.

$50 - $7.50 = $42.50.


You can buy the blouse for $42.50.

 If you have a normal size body but feel that your face is not slim, consider whether you might have a distorted notion of your proportions.


Look at closely related family members. Do they have the same facial proportions as you? You may have a genetic predisposition to a certain layout of weight around your face. Also, some forms of facial chubbiness may be related to your youth and "puppy fat" tends to pass with aging.
Ask people you can trust to be honest to you. Do they think your face is chubby or do they think it is appropriately proportioned?
Is your face "puffy", as opposed to being fat? Puffiness can be caused by poor nutrition, salty foods, lack of sleep, alcohol or drug intake, medical conditions, lack of exercise, etc.
Talk to your doctor. He or she will be able to reassure you as to what facial fat proportions are appropriate. Also, your doctor can discard possible problems such as edema (swelling).;
, Slumping posture can cause an appearance of a fatter face by forcing a double chin look. Any fat you do have will simply shift to the most comfortable placement and if your posture pushes your neck and chin downward, this may fatten your face.


Stand and sit up straighter, so as to align your spine properly. Ask for help from a physiotherapist or doctor if you're not sure how you should be standing or sitting to ensure good posture.
Breathe deeply. It is harder to slump when you breathe more deeply, as you need to straighten up to fill with air.
Remind yourself to hold your shoulders back, tilt your head and chin up more and look people in the eyes.
Posture improving exercises exist; ask your physiotherapist for more details or check online sources. Pilates, yoga and similar exercises will help too.

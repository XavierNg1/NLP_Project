 If you have a down or memory foam pillow, do not ignore the warnings printed on the label, as the materials in these pillows are not water safe. Instead, use spot treatments alone. If this is the case, you can treat stains using a paste of baking soda and water, or spray vinegar to eliminate odor.
 Because you cannot use a washer, get creative with your pillow whitening. Set yellowed down or microfiber pillows in a sunny window to lighten them, apply bleach or vinegar using a small toothbrush, or apply baking soda to the pillow to soak up dampness and odor., Squeeze your pillow 3-7 times, allowing the detergent to work its way through all of the material, then rinse under cool water and squeeze to dry.Do not wring your pillow, as this can damage the memory foam and tear the netting holding the foam in place.

 One of the more common preventable cause of cramped muscles is dehydration. You should especially aim to drink water before, during, and after exercise. However, simply not drinking enough water throughout the day can also lead to muscle cramps.Try to drink 16 â€“ 24 ounces of water at least an hour before working out. This will ensure that your body is sufficiently hydrated for exercise.
Keep water within reach during your workout.
Follow your exercise with drinking more water. You may also choose to drink a sports drink with electrolytes.
 Muscle cramps can be caused by unbalanced electrolytes, such as calcium, potassium, magnesium and sodium. If you're experiencing muscle cramps, try changing up your diet.


It's not a good idea to self-treat with supplements. You should talk to a doctor before trying any nutritional supplements as, in excess, such pills can be harmful.The best means to work on balancing your electrolytes is to eat a balanced diet. Eat a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables, especially leafy greens like lettuce and spinach. Eating bananas can also help as they're high in potassium.In addition, make sure you are eating at least a few hours before you exercise.
 Some prescription medications can cause muscle cramps as a side effect. If your cramps started shortly after trying a new medication, that might be the cause. Check the bottle for a listing of side effects. If the cramping persists, talk to your doctor about switching doses or types of your medications.

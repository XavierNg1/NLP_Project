 Designating a username is one of the first things you do when you sign up for RuneScape. Create a username that contains attributes about you.;
, RuneScape usernames can be 12 characters maximum and can include letters, numbers, spaces, and hyphens. Note that special characters (e.g., @ or *) will be automatically replaced by a space. However, usernames cannot start or end with a space. Usernames are case sensitive, so remember which letters are capitalised.



You cannot register with a username that's already taken.
Your RuneScape username cannot include the words "Jagex," "Mod" or "Java" in any form, amongst anything else that would make you look like staff or a moderator of Jagex.
You cannot include any curse words, racial slurs or other intentionally offensive language in your username. Jagex will change your username if you ignore these rules.
You can only create so many usernames from one IP address before you are capped. Choose wisely.
 Do not use your real name or your address. If you can, avoid giving any hint of your personal information as possible.
 Only members and free players without a screen name can change their usernames.


If you are a member, you can change it by going to Account Management, then Change Display Name. Note that it takes 28 days to change your username again.

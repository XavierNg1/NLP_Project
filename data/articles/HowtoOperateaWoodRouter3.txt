 This allows the motor to plunge downward to the depth you desire for making the cut.
 Push downward and move the router from right to left while holding down on the base. Let up when you have reached the end of your cut. The motor should move upward retracting the bit.
 These tables can be used with medium and larger sized plunge and fixed-base routers. They vary in size from stand-alone to bench-top.


The router is mounted upside down on a special plate that fits into a hole cut into a table top. Otherwise, it operates the same. The advantage is that it makes more accurate cuts and expands the use of a router.

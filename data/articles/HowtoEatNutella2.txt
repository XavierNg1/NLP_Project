 Nutella pairs well with almost any fruit.


Slice an assortment of fruits. Try a mixture of bananas, apples, and berries.
Toss the sliced fruit with a little lemon juice to keep them from browning.
Arrange the sliced fruits on a tray in a ring, leaving a space in the center of the tray for a bowl of Nutella fruit dip.
Add a few tablespoons of Nutella to an 8 oz package of cream cheese and mix well. You may want to add some powdered sugar if you find the cream cheese too tart.
Pour the Nutella fruit dip into a small bowl and place in the center of the tray.



Slice a mixture of your favorite fruits into large chunks.
Take the pieces of fruit and arrange them onto skewers so that each skewer has a nice mix of each fruit.
Warm some Nutella in a saucepan over low heat.
Using a wooden spoon or spatula, drizzle the warm Nutella over each of the fruit shish kabobs and serve.
 The sweetness of Nutella pairs well with pears grilled in a light coating of salt and oil.


Slice a few pears in half lengthwise and rub with a little salt and oil. Avoid oils with strong vegetable flavors, such as olive oil. Instead, try to use a neutral oil or a sweeter oil like coconut oil.
You can use an outdoor grill or cook indoors in a cast iron skillet or grill pan.
Set the heat to medium-low and cook pears until soft, about 15 minutes.
Remove pears from heat and drizzle with warm Nutella.
Serve immediately.

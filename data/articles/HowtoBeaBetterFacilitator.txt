;
, Start with a few of your own and ask the group to for any others they would like to include. Some examples of ground rules:


Confidentiality. What is said in this room, stays in this room
Speak from your experience. Use “I” instead of “you” or “we”
There are no right or wrong answers. Our responses are based on our unique experience
Practice respect for myself and others
Listen actively. Respect others when they are talking.
,,,,,


As a facilitator, your talk time should be less than 40%
Ask open-ended questions
Be comfortable with silence – it may be a time of thought. Wait a full 10 seconds after asking a question.
Address people by name.
Use your personal experience as an example when appropriate.

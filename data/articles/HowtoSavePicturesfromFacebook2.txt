, Once the viewing window is open, click on the word "Options" in the bottom right-hand corner of the picture – between "Tag Photo" and "Share". This will open up an action menu with options like "Change Date", "Download", "Make Profile Picture", and "Report Photo".
 The photo will automatically download to your computer's "Downloads" folder. The image will be saved as a JPEG file, and the name will be a long, algorithm-generated string of time-signifying digits., You can also click the small downward arrow on the right-hand side of the box to access an action menu: click "Open" to view, or click "Show in folder" to see the place where the file is saved.
 You can leave the file as is, in the Downloads folder, but you may have trouble finding it later unless you give the photo a memorable name. When you are viewing the name or thumbnail of the file in the Downloads folder, right-click on the file and select "Rename" to rename it. You can drag the file to another folder, if you like—perhaps a dedicated photo album folder on your computer—or you can leave it where it is.

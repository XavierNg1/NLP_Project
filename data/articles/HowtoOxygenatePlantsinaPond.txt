 Replacing old water with fresh water will improve and replenish the oxygen in your pond overall.


Remove one-third of your old pond water and replace that amount with fresh water that does not contain chlorine or other chemicals that are harmful to your plants or fish.





;
, Debris such as leaves or twigs can deplete the oxygen from your pond and plants at a fast rate.


Use a pond net, skimmer net, or water vacuum to remove debris from the surface and bottom of your pond.
 A clean filter will help maintain the oxygen in your pond by supporting water flow and movement, and by removing excess waste.


Clean the filter as needed according to the manufacturer's directions, when the water flow slows down, when the filter becomes blocked with debris, or before you plan on being away from home for an extended period of time.






Replace the old filter with a new filter once per year to maintain the quality of the filter.
 Oxygenator plants will naturally add oxygen to your pond to help support your other pond plants, and will also help reduce algae growth.


Place oxygenator plants such as anacharis, cabomba, moneywort, tapegrass, hygrophilia, water hornwort, ludwigia, sagittaria, and vallisneria into your pond.
 Aeration devices such as fountains, bubblers, waterfalls, diffusers, or air pumps will help circulate your pond water and increase the oxygen levels needed for your plants and fish.

Consult with the manual for your aeration device or with its manufacturer to determine how to install the device in your pond.

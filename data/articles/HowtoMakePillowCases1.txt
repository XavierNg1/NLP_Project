 Pillow cases are often made from a fabric that feels comfortable against the skin, like soft cotton, satin, flannel or a jersey knit fabric. Pick out fabric that matches the color scheme in your bedroom, especially your bed covering and sheets. To make a set of standard pillow cases, you will need 2 yards (1.8Â m) of fabric.









If you're going to sleep on the pillow cases, be sure to choose a washable fabric.
If you're making pillow cases that are more decorative in purpose, the fabric you choose doesn't have to be soft or quite as easily washable. Choose any type of fabric you'd like to complement the color scheme in your bedroom.;
, To make a standard pillowcase, use a scissors or a rotary cutter to cut out a piece that is 45" x 36". If you're using a patterned fabric, take care to cut it so that the pattern is straight.
 Fold it length-wise with the finished sides, or "right" sides, of the fabric together. The unfinished sides, or "wrong" sides, should be facing out.
 Use a sewing machine or a threaded needle to make a straight stitch up the long side of the fabric. Turn the fabric and continue stitching one of the sort sides. When you're finished, turn the fabric right side out.









Use a thread that matches your fabric or a contrasting thread to add a little flair.
If you're stitching by hand, take your time and make sure your seam is completely straight. You can pin the fabric with straight pins to help guide your stitching if necessary.
 Start by folding the fabric back to create a 1/2-inch hem. Iron the fabric to create a crease. Fold the fabric back again, this time creating a 3-inch hem. Iron the fabric again and use your sewing machine or a needle and thread to stitch around the base of the hem to keep it in place.
 You can add ribbon, decorative lace, or other decorations to the finished pillowcase. Consider sewing a colorful contrasting ribbon over the hemline to hide the stitch there.

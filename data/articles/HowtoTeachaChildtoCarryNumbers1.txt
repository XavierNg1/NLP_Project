, Draw a line between the "units" and the "tens" column to help align and use "place values" in columns. It is not important for your child to already know how to do two column addition.
 Do not have them put a "1" over the numbers, yet.
 Make certain the child places the digit(s) in the correct position (no digit should be in the units column.) If they are confused, cover up the units column. Have the child write the number(s) underneath the number already written in the "tens" column from the "units" column addition.
 Review what you have completed so far.


If you were using the example above, you might say, "We're almost done. You did seven plus five equals twelve. Good. Four plus three equals seven. Correct. Notice that the four and the three are in the tens position, so you are really adding forty and thirty."

, Have the child bring the amount in the units column down to the bottom. Point to the numbers in the "tens" column and ask the child to add them up.
 By now, the child should already be familiar with the commutative law of addition or (at least) know that the order of addition is unimportant.
, Tell the child that this is a shortcut we call "carrying", and more commonly called "regrouping" in classrooms today.

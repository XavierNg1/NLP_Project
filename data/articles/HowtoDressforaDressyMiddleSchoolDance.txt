 Cute dresses usually work for this kind of event. Definitely get something AGE APPROPRIATE. Remember this is a middle school dance and you're 11, 12, 13, or 14, not 21 and you're not going clubbing! If your school has a dress code, be sure to follow it. You could also get a cute flowy shirt and skirt or nice pants. Find something that compliments your shape and skin/eye color.;
,, Leave enough time (a lot) for your hair to dry, to do your hair, and makeup. Remember to shave. (Legs and underarms),, Make sure you have matching body mist or perfume. You don't want to clash scents.
 Have the nail polish match what you're going to paint your fingers too, make sure it matches your outfit. If you're wearing navy, don't wear black nail polish and vice versa.
 If you have long hair, try curling it. If your hair is short, have it straight. A nice flower or barrette is very elegant but make sure it matches your dress. Remember to put in lots of hairspray because you are going to be dancing.
 Remember, it has to match your toes. If you can get a manicure-pedicure that's awesome.
 Make sure you put on deodorant and brush your teeth before you do, so that there aren't any stains.
 Less is more. Eye shadow in a light or subtle color is ideal. Also some eye liner and mascara looks really good with a light shade of sparkly lip gloss.
 If your dress is somewhat plain, you can wear a long necklace and bangles. Also, remember to bring a little purse or bag so you have somewhere to store the essentials: money, mints or gum, touch up makeup, a cell phone, and feminine products (if you need them.)

, Make sure the scent matches the body lotion. If not, it may smell funny, and that turns some guys off.

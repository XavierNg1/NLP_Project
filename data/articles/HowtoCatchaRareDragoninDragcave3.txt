 Learn the description of the egg and search for that one description.
 Repeatedly refresh until a rare drops, then click it as fast as you can. Alternatively, click on each biome in order; this offers better coverage but you're more likely to not notice a rare until it's too late if you aren't seeing the descriptions change as you would if you commit to one biome.
 You are most likely to find the egg this way with more people searching. Get some friends who are willing to help you find the egg. Have each one assigned to a biome, constantly refreshing the page. When a friend finds it, offer them a trade, just to be nice. (They did after all just help you find a rare egg.)

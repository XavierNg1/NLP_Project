 You've stayed inside all winter, so get out your bike and go for a nice, long ride. Grab a friend or two and go hiking. Go to the beach, lake, ocean for an afternoon of swimming and tanning. Go jogging or even just for a walk in the park or on the sidewalk. Walk your dog (or your neighbor's dog if you don't own a dog yourself).


Go rollerblading. It's great exercise and fun.
 Gather some friends and go set up a tent somewhere. A yard, open field (if you're allowed), or a camp site are great places to set up camp. Make sure you have the necessary equipment so you're not stranded in the rain wearing shorts and sandals with nothing to do. Try to set up camp by a lake for a lovely view and easy access to swimming grounds. Camping and swimming. What's not to love?

, Go get out the hose or the sprinkler if you don't have access to a lake, river, or pool. Who says you can't be 10 again?


Buy a kiddy pool. Sure, it's meant for toddlers and children, but it can be great fun with a few of your pals. Slather on the sunblock, pop on your shades, crank up your music and lounge in the pool. It's a fairly cheap way to stay cool in the sun.
Buy, borrow, or rent a Slip N Slide. Remember these? They're yellow things you spread on the lawn and spray with the hose. It's a great way to entertain you and your friends. Fire up the hose and go sliding. Don't forget to take pictures!

, After all, camp is a great place to meet new friends. Plus, there are a lot of different camps out there to choose from.
 You don't have to go anywhere exotic, just visit somewhere in your country, state, or even in your town. Go on a road trip with your family, or go with a few friends to a local place you've never been to before.
 You can grow small plants in flower pots or grow a small vegetable or fruit garden. Look up recipes for preserving your harvest, and prepare to bottle and can things at summer's end.

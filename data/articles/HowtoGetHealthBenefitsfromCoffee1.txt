Medium roast coffees also have some similar antioxidant qualities and health benefits.There is some evidence that extremely dark roast coffees lose some of their antioxidant health benefits.
Avoid light roast coffees which have lower levels of antioxidants.;
, Like most commercially grown plant products, coffee beans tend to be heavily sprayed with herbicides and pesticides. Toxins in these applications can cause significant health problems. To avoid these toxins, purchase organically grown coffees that have not been treated with harmful chemicals.Most coffees will have a label on their packaging to let your know if they are organic.
 If you suffer from acid reflux, insomnia, or osteoporosis, you may want to drink decaffeinated coffee. Caffeine can intensify acid reflux and make sleeping more difficult.

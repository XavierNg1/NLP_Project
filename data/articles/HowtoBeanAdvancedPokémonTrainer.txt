EV stands for Effort Value. Every Pokémon, when beaten gives effort values. When your Pokémon gains a level, every fourth effort point equals one point up in the respective stat, unless you've reach the maximum number of effort points for the Pokémon. EV training can cover weaknesses and polish strengths. Lists of Pokémon's effort point stat(s) can be found at various fansites.



When breeding, certain moves can be passed down to certain Pokémon. As in the last step lists of parents, and moves can be found at various fansites.



When used together, certain moves can give you great advantages over your opponents, for example using Leech Seed with Substitute, you'll be healed from Substitute but still be protected. You should also use moves to play to your stats.
 Items and abilities can do anything from heal to poison, and can add advantages to or eliminate disadvantages from moves. For example you could use an ability like Static with a move like Light Screen, adding disadvantages to both types of moves.

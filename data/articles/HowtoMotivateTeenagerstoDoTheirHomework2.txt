 Introduce yourself to your teenager’s teachers and school administration. Make it clear that they can get in touch with you if they have any questions or concerns involving your child’s education. Volunteer at the school or make an appearance at school functions. Your teenager might be more motivated to stay on top of their schoolwork if they know that you are active in their school community.Schedule a parent/teacher conference.
 Instead of fighting and creating a tense environment regarding school work and performance, consider working with them to develop a plan. Offer your advice and allow them the space to develop a work plan that works for them. Instead of arguing about the results, provide constructive criticism to see if they can solve the problem themselves. This will make the teen feel more grown up and respected.For example, your teenager just received their midterm grade in math and they have a D. They have three weeks to bring their grade up before their next report card. Have a conversation with your teen by asking them what they need to do to bring their grade up. If they say that they need to study more, suggest that they bring home their math book each day and spend at least 30 minutes studying what they went over in class that day.
 Teenagers often need prompted or reminded to do something, especially things that they don’t want to do. Try to remember that you are the adult and they are still a child. Teenagers do not need to be prompted as regularly as an elementary student, but they do still need reminded to stay on track from time to time.


Consider using technology to set reminders for your teenager. Set calendar reminders on your phone and sync it to their phone. There are also several family management apps that may help.

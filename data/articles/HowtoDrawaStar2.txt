Place a pencil into the pencil holder on your compass. Then, place the point in the center of a piece of paper.
Turn the top of the compass while keeping the point still. The pencil will draw a circle that is perfectly centered around the point.
 Then, move the point of your compass until it is on top of the dot. Do not change the radius of the compass as you are moving it.
 Repeat this on the right side of the point that you drew.
 Make another mark on the edge of the circle.
 Set your compass aside.



Place your pencil on the top mark. Skip the first mark to the left and connect the top mark to the second mark to the left.
Draw a second mark straight across to the right, skipping the mark on the bottom.
Finish by connecting that mark to the top mark. This will complete your first triangle.



Place your pencil on the bottom mark. Connect it with the second mark to the left by drawing a straight line.
Draw a line straight across to your right, skipping the top mark.
Finish the second triangle by drawing an additional line back to the bottom mark on the edge of the circle.
 Your 6-point star is complete.

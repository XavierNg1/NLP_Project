 These are very harsh on your hair and should not be used too often. Products such as hair serum should always be used when applying heat, in order to protect your hair. Be sure that you also do not have the heat setting too high. Try to use things like blow dryers on their lowest setting.
 Avoid tight hairstyles like ponytails and buns or too-tight braids and extensions, as these pull hair and hinder growth. The strain on hair from tight styles such as these can leader hair to weaken and break. It also puts strain on the scalp itself by inhibiting blood flow. This can lead to headaches and keeps hair from getting necessary nutrients.


The places on your scalp which see the most strain could even see hair loss (traction alopecia).
Use looser styles if possible and try to avoid hair ties with metal pieces, as these can catch on and pull out hair. Rubber bands and tight elastic ties can also pull out hair. Look for “ouchless” or no-damage hair ties, or gentle elastic ribbon ties.
 It may seem counter-intuitive, but trimming your hair can actually promote hair growth. When split ends develop, this weakens hair and causes it to break. If hair is trimmed regularly, this will significantly reduce split ends, leading to stronger and better-looking hair. Hair should be trimmed by half to one inch every six to eight weeks.


Even if trimming means you have to sacrifice more length than you’d like, keep in mind that it’s better to have shorter, healthier hair than long, unhealthy hair.

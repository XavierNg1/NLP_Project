 Hosting may be offered through dedicated, shared, and cloud level.

Shared hosting is fairly common because it’s more affordable than the other types of hosting. However, it could slow down your website’s performance if there are too many hosting clients that share your server and the hosting service is ill equipped with substandard hardware.
Dedicated may be pricey but you get to occupy your own server, you get full control, and guarantee good performance for your website. Meanwhile, cloud hosting offers a more flexible environment because it enables smooth upgrades when your website sees increased traffic. Also, you get dedicated bandwidth, memory, and CPU so even if you do share a server with others, you don’t share resources.;
, Every business, every organisation will grow, which means the influx of traffic your website gets today could very well increase in the future. So you’ll need your Web host to offer higher bandwidth to ensure that your site doesn't stall when you get too many users on. You should also consider the security system and the level of support your Web host can deliver. Protect your website through monitoring of suspicious activities and guarantee resolution with every problem by gaining 24/7 technical support., Get proper references. You’ll want to talk to other website owners about their experiences with Web hosts. Ask how hosting issues were resolved and how fast. While no website will have all good experiences with hosting, there are some hosting companies that have fewer issues with some websites.

 Arrange the tomatillos in a single layer in a large, heavy frying pan.

Do not stack the tomatillos in multiple layers.
A cast iron frying pan will give you the best results, but if you do not have a cast iron pan, any heavy pan should work well enough.
This method draws out the "earthy" flavor undertones of the fruit.;
, Place the frying pan on your stove and switch the heat to low. Roast the tomatillos for 20 to 30 minutes, turning them occasionally using tongs.

Continue cooking until the tomatillos become very soft on all sides. You should also notice some light browning on all sides, but the skins will not usually blacken when you use this method.
 Remove the tomatillos from the heat and let them rest at room temperature for a few minutes, or until they are cool enough to touch with your fingers. They should be ready to use or eat as you desire at the completion of this step.

You can peel the skin off tomatillos after cooking them, but doing so is only optional.

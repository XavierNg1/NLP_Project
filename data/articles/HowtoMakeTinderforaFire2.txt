 This material is an invaluable resource to take with you when you venture into the outdoors.

Place several small squares (about one square inch in size) of cotton fabric into an airtight container that can withstand heat, such as a metal water bottle.






Set the container atop an already flaming fire for about five minutes.






Remove the container from the fire using tongs and allow to cool.






Open the container and observe the squares. They should be blackened in color., The steel wool you use to scour your pots can be excellent tinder and all you have to do is light it.
 Finally, that annoying lint that you have to clean out of your dryer every time you put in a new load has a use! Simply collect enough lint to form it into a long rod-shaped mold and ignite.
 The petroleum grease ignites extremely easily.
 A rolled-up newspaper, the cover of a paperback novel, or whatever paper material is available to you will help get a fire started. While you wouldn't want to turn your map into tinder, any spare paper can work to ignite a fire, though it requires more patience than some of the other methods.

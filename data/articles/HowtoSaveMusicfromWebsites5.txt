 If you're on a website that is playing a song in the background, there's a good chance that you'll be able to download the music file. This will only work on sites where the file is not encrypted or embedded into another player., This will open a new tab with the website's source code. Make sure you're not right-click an image or text, or you won't get the correct menu. You can also press Ctrl+U as a shortcut.
 This will let you search for text in the source code.
 This will search the source code for "mp3," which is the common extension for music files.
 Look through the highlighted results until you see an MP3 file that has a full web address, including http:// or ftp:// at the beginning and .mp3 at the end. The address may be quite long.


If you don't get any results for samp.mp3, you can try other common song formats like .m4a or .ogg. If you still don't get results, the song is most likely hidden behind an embedded player or encrypted.
 Make sure you select the whole thing, then right-click your selection and click "Copy."

, The MP3 file should begin playing in your browser's built-in media player in the center of the window. Nothing else will load besides the song.
 This will let you save the MP3 file to your computer.
 AS soon as the MP3 finishes downloading, you can play it or transfer it to your MP3 player or smartphone.

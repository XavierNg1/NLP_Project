 In this modern world of cell phones and computers, using your eyes is not the only way to wink. You can communicate a wink via text message or a social networking site using a winking emoji.There are different types of winking emojis, depending on what type of phone you have, what social networking site you are using, etc.
An emoji wink is usually used to communicate that something is a joke, or to flirt.
 Before emojis were created, people would often use punctuation marks to create a winking face. Some people still prefer this style, called an "emoticon," or use it because they have an older phone, or are using an email system that doesn't support emojis. You can communicate a wink in any of these ways:;)

, A less common way to indicate a wink in text or email that some people use is simply to place the word "wink" between two asterisks. This works in the same way as an emoticon or emoji to convey humor or flirtation.

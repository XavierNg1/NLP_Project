 The Scottish flag is easy to identify--it’s blue with a white X across it. The X is also called a saltire or a St. Andrews Cross. Displaying the Scottish flag is a good way to show the world that you’re proud of Scotland and its history., Wearing tartan patterns is a great way to show your Scottish pride! Tartan is patterned like plaid, and you can get it in hundreds of different styles, from traditional red, green, and yellow to neon pink. You can rent or buy a full kilt, or you can simply wear a tartan scarf, hat, or shirt. If you have a Scottish surname, your family may even have its own tartan design you can wear., Change your profile picture to the Scottish flag, post a picture of yourself in tartan, or post a message wishing your friends a happy St. Andrews Day! You can even post videos of people celebrating St. Andrews Day in Scotland, or a tutorial on how to make your favorite Scottish foods. This is a great way to celebrate St. Andrews Day if you live far away from Scotland.

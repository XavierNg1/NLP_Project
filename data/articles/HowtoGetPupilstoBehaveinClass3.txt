 Students may think they can misbehave and that you are laid back if you are wearing something like T-Shirts and Jeans. Try wearing button-up shirts with ties and plain dark trousers. Avoid wearing too much bright colours. Don't go overboard, or students could feel scared of you a lot of the time in the bad way.
 Students will think they can mess around while you are not paying attention. Instead, walk around the class to observe and make sure that students are working and not just chatting.
 Give each student 3 Â pieces of paper, one with green, one with red and the other with orange. Tell your students that if they understand the work to put the green piece of paper on top, if they somewhat understand to put the orange piece of paper on top, and if they don't understand at all to put the red piece of paper on top. This will help it be easy for you to tell if a student needs help. Sometimes when students don't understand the work they will give up on it and talk with their friends.


Make the paper smaller so that they don't take up too much space.
Laminate the paper to stop them from drawing on it.
If a student is continuously putting up red and giving up on the work, try motivating them and encourage them to give it a go.
 Monitor chatty students to see who they are most likely to chat to and move them to sit by more hard working and quieter students.


If you don't know a class that well, try changing seats after a while to get to know who they work well with and who they misbehave with.
 If your cafeteria supplies sugary drinks, ask for them to replace it with juice or water. While energy is necessary for pupils to learn, too much sugar could cause them to be more hyper in lessons and not pay attention.

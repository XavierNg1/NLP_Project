 An all-natural black gel eyeliner gets its color from activated charcoal, which is usually used to treat stomach issues and for other medicinal purposes. Open 1 to 2 activated charcoal capsules and dump the powder into a small bowl.You can usually find activated charcoal capsules at the drugstore. They’re also available at a variety of online stores.
 With the charcoal powder in the bowl, add ½ teaspoon (2.25 g) of coconut oil. Stir the two together with a toothpick or even an eyeliner brush until you have a smooth paste.You can substitute grapeseed or sweet almond oil for the coconut oil. Just add ¼ (1 ml) teaspoon instead.
You can also mix distilled water with the charcoal instead of the coconut oil. However, a water-based liner won’t last as long on the eyes.
 Once you’ve created the gel liner, use a spoon or small spatula to place it in a small pot or other container with a lid. When you’re ready to line your eyes, use your usual eyeliner brush and carefully drag the liner across your lash line.The gel liner will stain clothing and other fabrics, so be careful when you’re putting it in a storage container and applying it.
Refrigerating the gel liner will help it last longer. Even if you store it in the fridge, you should throw it away after a month.

The packaging used for this project. In this case it is a clear lid off a container but you could also use a disposable plate, or other polystyrene product with the right label on it.;
,







Continue with the whole design but don't go out to the edges; this part is going to shrink.






Aim to alternate some of the the colors on separate sides of the plastic.






Also do the outlining on the opposite side of the plastic.






In doing so, you will get a lovely stereoscopic effect. And that can prevent the marker dye transfer.
 Cut with care so as to leave smooth edges. Leave an uncolored, plain edge space with no design (unlike the image here) to allow for shrinkage., Use a simple hole punch to achieve this., Preheat an oven or toaster oven to 325Â°.







Place the plastic design onto the foil and put into the oven when the temperature is hot. Wear oven mitts for this step and the following step.
 Careful! This will happen very quickly so do not leave it unattended. When it shrinks as wished, remove it with tongs or chopsticks. Place the hot plastic pendant onto a ceramic plate to cool., Once cooled, use as a pendant, keyring, or anything else you think it'd look good as.







The finished design.

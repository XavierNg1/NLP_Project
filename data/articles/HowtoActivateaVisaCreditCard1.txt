 When you receive your new credit card in the mail, it should have a sticker on the front that will explain how to activate it by either calling a phone number or going to a website. Locate the number and dial it using your phone.Ordinarily, the phone number will be a toll-free number, such as an 800 number.
Depending upon your card issuer, you may only be able to call at certain times, such as during regular business hours.Some card issuers only allow activation by phone.You may be asked to call and activate your card from a phone number that the card issuer has on file. If you do not or cannot, you may have to speak with a representative from the card issuer to activate the card. This is a security measure to prevent credit card fraud.;
, When you call to activate your card, you may be asked a series of security questions.Whether a live person or an automated assistant asks you these questions, you will need to answer them (possibly by punching numbers in using your phoneâ€™s keypad) in order to activate the card. These security questions will be based on personal information that may include things like:


Your account number
Your PIN number
Your social Security number
Your address
Your date of birth

, Once you have completed the call and your card is activated, you can remove the sticker from the front of the card. You should also sign the back of the card in the designated area. If you do not sign, merchants should ask to see identification when you attempt to use the card. Once the card is activated, it is ready to use.


Remember to destroy your old card, such as by shredding it or cutting it up.

 Be aware that there are legal restrictions on Arnica in the United States (it has been ruled unsafe for internal use).


While Arnica can be grown from seed, it takes up to two years for it to germinate, so you'll need to be patient! If sowing seeds, do so in early spring in a shallow tray filled with equal parts loam, sand, and peat. Keep in a cold frame or a greenhouse until mid-spring.;
, It needs sandy soil that is rich in humus and has excellent drainage. Arnica prefers a sunny position (full sun) and will also tolerate indirect sun.
 The soil should be kept moist.
 Typical of sub-alpine plants, it knows how to thrive without fertilizer.
 The flowers can be picked off in mid- to late summer. The root can be dug up when the leaves die in autumn for more division. Use the flowers as decorations or for drying.

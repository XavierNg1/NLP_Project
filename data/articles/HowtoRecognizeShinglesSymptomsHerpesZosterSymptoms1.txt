 Before the characteristic shingles blisters develop, you may feel pain, tingling, or itching in the area that is affected. The area may even become numb or be sensitive to touch.This can occur any time between 1 and 5 days before the rash shows up.If you feel any discomfort in a stripe-like pattern on your body for over a day, see your doctor and ask about shingles – especially if you have recently been in contact with anyone with a rash.


Tell your doctor something like, “I have been feeling a burning sensation over my left ribs since yesterday, do you think I might have shingles?” They will ask you other questions and possibly prescribe an antiviral medicine to reduce the severity of symptoms.;
, Shingles generally develop on one side of your face or body. This is related to the way the virus affects your nerves and the parts of the body that those nerves are connected to. Common places to develop signs and symptoms of shingles are in single stripes over your ribs, on your neck or shoulders, and on one side of your face.The most commonly affected area is in a stripe wrapping around one side of your torso.If you have another condition that weakens your immune system (such as HIV, an autoimmune disorder, certain chronic infections, or cancer), the virus may be more widespread and affect both sides of your body.
 In some cases, the virus that causes shingles can cause symptoms that affect your whole body (systemic symptoms). These symptoms may include:Headache
Chills

Upset stomach or nausea
Fever

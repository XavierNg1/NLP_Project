 If you have a hard time answering that, then it's time for step two.;
, It's easy to fall prey to complacency. Remember that this person is just as complicated as you are. Find out more about your loved one. You may be surprised at all the things you still have to learn 5, 10, 15, 30 years into knowing this person.
 Really listen. Then ask more questions. Become interested in what that person has to say. Don't just listen to what they say and then turn it around to be about you.
 Familiarity breeds contempt, they say. Get out of the house once in a while. Go somewhere, do something you have never done with that person.
 Telling someone an inner wish or dream creates new bonds and strengthens old ones.
 Be free with the hugs and they will come back to you tenfold.
 Stop off at the store and buy them their favorite ice cream. Send them a letter or a postcard. Call them up just to wish them well. These things do not go unnoticed.
 Leaving a mess for your loved one to take care of is not only rude and insensitive, but it's just bad manners. They will appreciate you more if you appreciate them.
 Most of us respect our loved ones and what they are doing with their lives. But how often do we tell them? It's not so hard to say, "I really think what you are doing is remarkable." Or, "You have incredible courage to do what you are doing." It feels good to be open with those you love.

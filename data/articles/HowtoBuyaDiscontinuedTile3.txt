 If you are unable to find your original tile anywhere, don’t give up. Search online for reproduction companies that specialize in matching discontinued tiles. See if they currently offer your specific tile. If not, find out if they are willing to make a custom order.Since these are reproductions, they may have entirely different product info, which might not show up in your initial search.
 If no exact reproductions are available, find a new tile that matches your original one as closely as possible. Contact the manufacturer to see if they offer any new designs that only differ from the original by a slight tweak.If not, visit brick-and-mortar stores with the product info or a sample tile. Ask them for recommendations on matching your tile with another manufacturer’s product.


The key factors to consider in matching tile are size, shape, color, and texture.
 If no one product captures the same size, shape, color, and texture as your original, prioritize which factors matter most to you. From there, alter the other characteristics to fit your needs as best you can. For example:


If the new tile resembles the old in all ways except for being thinner, don’t worry. Apply extra mastic (an adhesive used to laying tile) underneath the new tile so its surface is even with the old.If the store has another tile that’s perfect except for being too large, ask them if they are able to cut it down to size and/or shape.If not, ask if they would be able to special-order pre-cut tiles from the manufacturer.
If the new tile’s shade of color is slightly off from the original, incorporate this into the room’s design. Buy additional tiles in two or three neighboring shades. Instead of having a handful of new tiles in one new shade stick out as obvious replacements, give the tiled surface more variety to make it look intentional.

 Snack sized or regular depending on which the customer ordered.
 When it won't fit anymore hit the bottom against a counter top a couple times. Then fill it some more. It should be full but leaving just a little bit of room at the top., Place the open cap over the treat.,

M&Ms get one shot of M&M's for snack sized, two for regular.
Oreo's get one shot of crushed up Oreos for snack sized, two for regular.
Twix ones get one scoop of Twix mix and one full pump of hot caramel for both.
 Mix it up a little and move the spoon to about the middle of the treat. This'll make it easier to blend. Do not place the spoon all the way to the bottom., While holding the cup with one hand, turn the machine on with the other. Ensure you have a firm grip on the cup., Making sure to go all the way to the bottom and around the sides.,,

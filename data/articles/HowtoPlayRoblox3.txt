 Different worlds allow different gear types, depending on what gameplay the owner of the world wants to emphasize. Types of gear include melee weapons, ranged weapons, explosives, navigation enhancers, power-ups, musical instruments, social items, building tools, and transport.
 A screen showing the contents of your backpack will open depending on what you have accumulated in the game.Pressing the backpack button will allow you to organize the things in your inventory.
 You can choose what gear shows up on your hotkeys in the upper left-hand corner of your screen. This will have a series of numbers showing what number activates what gear. You can change the hotkeys by navigating to your backpack again and dragging the gear in your backpack to one of the hotkeys., There are many badges in the game you can earn to show that you have improved in something, such as combat badges, or visiting badges. For example, visiting badges are earned by visiting a certain number of players worlds. Remember, going to free badge places is not "earning" badges.

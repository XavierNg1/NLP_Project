 The best way to propel bits of potato is with a piece of copper piping. Visit a hardware store to purchase a copper pipe.The inner diameter of the pipe should be ⅝ inches. Ask someone at the hardware store to assist you find the right size.


While at the store see if they’ll cut the pipe for you. A good size for the pipe is anywhere from ½ a foot to a full foot.
If you want, you could use a PVC pipe with the same diameter. Any pipe will work, but copper is durable and can withstand years of use.
The average overall length is half an inch, depending on what pipe you choose.;
, A dowel is a long cylindrical rod typically made of wood. You’ll need a dowel that is exactly ⅝ inches to fit into the piping. It’s important to use the same size to create the necessary air pressure to fire the spuds. The dowel should also be slightly larger than your piping.


You should be able to purchase the exact size at your hardware store.
If you have a small wooden block that is thin, but larger than ⅝”, sand it to size. Hold the sandpaper in your palm with the coarse part facing out. Put the wood in your hand. Twist and move the plank until you form a cylinder.
Use a tape measure or frequently check if the wood fits into the pipe. Try to make the dowel even.
 To properly hold the potato gun, you’ll need to add a grip. You can either use bicycle handlebar tape or an old school tricycle’s handgrip. This isn’t necessary, but it’ll add to the look and accessibility of the spud shooter.


You can usually find the handgrip at a thrift store or at a bike shop.
 To shoot out potatoes, you’ll need to use potatoes as ammo. Use older potatoes that have started to sprout, if you have any at your home. One potato contains over a hundred shots of ammunition.


Any type of potato will work.
 It’s good to keep other supplies and tools on hand when working on your spud gun. Keep coarse sandpaper on hand for modifying your dowel. You should also have duct tape or electrical tape.

 Cut a subpatch out of thin but solid material (e.g. a piece of an old t-shirt). Cut a patch slightly larger and wider than the tear you are repairing. Round the corners for easier insertion. Use tweezers to insert the subpatch under the tear. Smooth out the subpatch behind the leather; be careful not to do further damage to the leather., Apply a flexible craft glue to a large needle, palette knife, or plastic knife. Apply craft glue to the underside of the leather and the subpatch underneath. Do this all around until the tear is glued shut. Flatten the surface of the repair and wipe off excess glue with a wet cloth. Stronger adhesives may have to be cleaned up with rubbing alcohol. , Apply leather filler to the tear in a small thin layer. Some fillers can be force dried with a heat gun or blow dryer. Others must be allowed to cure on their own. Repeat the process until the surface is level. Do a final thin coat and emboss or texturize the compound with a gloved hand or saran wrap. Allow to cure. If necessary, gently polish any rough spots with 500 grit wet or dry sandpaper. , Begin with the repaired area. Dab or stipple a thin layer of dye with a sponge, brush or foam applicator. Allow to dry. Work surrounding areas as needed.

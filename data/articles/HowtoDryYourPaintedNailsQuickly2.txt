 Air dusters are not just for cleaning keyboards! Applying air dusters, or canned air, will use compressed cold air to dry your wet nails quickly.Be careful when using canned air and hold the can about 12 inches (30 cm) away from your hand. The chemicals and extreme cold can damage your skin, otherwise.
 Moving air currents are very effective when drying nails. Use your handy blow dryer to get a faster dry time on your manicure.


Do not put your blow dryer on high or high heat. This may smudge your nails. The high heat may also damage your skin., Use a olive-oil based cooking spray and spritz it on your still-wet manicure. It will help seal your nail polish and dry it faster.Hold the can about 12 inc (30 cm) away from your hand as to not smudge the wet paint with the force of the aerosol.

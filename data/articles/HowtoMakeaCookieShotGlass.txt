 Follow the recipe or directions on the box to create cookie dough. Be sure you use a cookie dough that can be rolled and cut with a cookie cutter. Drop cookies donâ€™t work as well with this method.


Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to firm dough.;
, Cut paper towel rolls into toilet paper roll size (or just gather your toilet paper rolls).


Wrap rolls in aluminum foil. Coat the entire cardboard, engulfing the entire roll with foil.
 Roll dough until the sheet of dough is the same size and thickness. Add flour as needed.
 Cut dough into strips using the pizza cutter. You may want to create a test strip first to accommodate the walls and bottom of the popover tin.


Cut circles to fit the bottom of the popover tin.
 Roll cookie strips into the parchment paper (like creating a rollup). Put aside.


Spray the inside of the tin with nonstick spray.
Place cut cookie circles in the bottom of each tin and then place a rolled cookie with parchment paper on top of the circle.
Add the aluminum foil wrapped paper roll in the middle of each cookie roll.
 Check cookies frequently.

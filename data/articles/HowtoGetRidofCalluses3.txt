 One of the most common causes of calluses is simply that the wrong shoe is being worn. If your shoes fit badly, calluses are more likely to form -- so go get yours personally fitted. They should be snug (but not hurt) and cater to the width of your feet.


Avoid heels whenever possible; they put all your weight on the ball of your foot -- a recipe for calluses, indeed. Wear flats whenever you can; they're more comfortable, too.If the calluses are on your hands, wearing padded gloves with a comfortable fit will alleviate and lessen the problem of developing calluses. Make sure that the gloves fit well; very loose gloves will do the opposite and irritate your skin more through the constant friction they produce., Calluses, corns, and bunions are not an uncommon phenomenon; as a result, a bunch of companies have started making shoe liners designed to get rid of them. Many are made out of moleskin and easily slip into your shoes in the shapes of strips or patches.For corns, use doughnut-shaped pads. They fit over the corn, decreasing pressure, rubbing, and friction. They're cheap and easy to find at most convenience or drug stores., You don't necessarily have to go to a doctor to find medications to alleviate the problem; pads, plasters, and other medications can be found over-the-counter fairly easily. However, most of them contain salicylic acid as one of the active ingredients -- and this can cause irritation or infection that can be more annoying (or serious) than what you were originally dealing with. If you fit one of the following conditions, it's best to avoid these:If you have diabetes
If you have reduced feeling in your feet, either from circulation problems or from neurological damage
If you have poor eyesight or flexibility and may not be able to use the product properly

 To draw the direct-open Brayton cycle, you need the compressor, combustion chamber and gas turbine. Direct means that the heat is directly added to the gas, so there is no need for a gas heater. Open means that after the gas is expanded in the turbine, it is rejected to the environment, so there is no need for a gas cooler., Place it at the left side, leave some space at the top of your drawing area., Place it at the top center of your paper., Place it at the right side, align it with the compressor., Draw lines that connect the three components. Also, draw lines to denote the entry to the compressor and the exit from the turbine., This shows how the gas goes through the cycle.

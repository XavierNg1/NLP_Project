 Think about how a tightrope walker uses their hands to maintain balance; you should be doing the same with your free hand. Although it might look like people wave it around just to look cool, it really can help you stay on the bull.Holding a hat in that hand might help, too!

, At times, the operator will make the bull go up, down, left, right and circles. Shifting your weight will help.


If the bull goes up with the head up and rear down, shift your weight in your pelvic area down.
If the bull goes down, with rear up and head down, shift your pelvic area up and lean back just a bit.
If the bull goes left, try to lean a bit right. If the bull goes right, then try leaning a bit left.
When the mechanical bull spins in circles, try to lean in the opposite way, so if it spins left, then lean a bit right. If the bull goes right, then lean left.

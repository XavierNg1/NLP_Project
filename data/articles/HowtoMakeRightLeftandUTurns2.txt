 You want to do this because left turns aren’t always allowed. If you see a sign saying that a left turn is illegal, then keep driving until you can make a legal left turn.For example, some traffic lights and intersections prohibit left turns.
 Do this at least 100 feet (30 meters) before the actual turn. As you approach the turn, reduce your speed to 10 to 15 miles per hour (16 to 24 kph) by pressing the break pedal. Get as close to the centerline or median as possible.Use the center left lane if one is available to make your left turn.
Do not attempt to make a left turn from a right lane.
 As you are yielding, keep your wheels straight by holding your steering wheel straight. If your wheels are slightly turned to the left while waiting, you may be shoved into oncoming traffic if a car hits you from behind., As a rule of thumb, do not turn if oncoming vehicles are less than 200 feet (60 meters) away from you. Once the lanes are clear, you may turn into either the left or right-hand lane if you are turning into a two-lane street.If you are turning into a single-lane street, make sure to not cut the corner of the oncoming traffic’s lane. In other words, do not make your left turn too tight.

 Let your girl band’s name come to you as organically as possible. The less thought and attempt at cleverness, the better. Create the music and allow the name to come to you., Appearance is also an important part of the girl band package. Create a visual match that is complementary to the sound of the band.You and the other ladies don’t have to wear the exact same thing, but dressing in a similar style might take less focus away from the band itself. One person standing out more than the rest of the band could pull focus away from what people really should pay attention to: the sound.
All-black ensembles are a great way to look uniform without dressing exactly alike. Another way to do that is to come up with a theme that dictates what the group wears: goth, vintage, girly, or punk.
 Your image should be an extension of your music. Think of the image of the band as the invitation and your music as the actual party.Don’t make your image an inauthentic version of yourself. If your band has an Ingrid Michaelson aesthetic where you all wear glasses in understated clothing as you play an intimate coffee shop, be authentic and allow your image to reflect that. Don’t feel the need to be scantily clad if sex isn’t something you’re trying to sell.
Your image will be what fans will see in promo shots of the band, flyers, and your band’s logo. Keep this in mind and try to be consistent in your brand awareness.

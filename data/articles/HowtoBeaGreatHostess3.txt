 Thank them for coming and tell them you all had a great time. If goody bags are a requirement, hand them out on the way out and thank them.
 Pick up and throw away any food items, things like cups and plates and napkins and wrappers. Make up the bed, clear off the floor, put your things back where they were before.
 Clothes that could've gotten mixed in with yours, somebody slipped out without a goody bag, anything. Call them up, thank them again and mention the item they left behind.

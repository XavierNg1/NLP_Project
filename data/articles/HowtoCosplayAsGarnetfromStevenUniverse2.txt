 Garnet has huge, cubical hair - a difficult thing to pull off in real life. You'd be best going with a very large black wig.
 You might have to sew on the two star layers (bright pink outer, light pink center), but you could potentially find a good top online. As for her sleeves, it's okay to have normal sleeves and not large, cubic ones. Puffed sleeves may get you closer, and styrofoam may get you even closer. Note that the left sleeve is dark red and matches the right side of her pants, while the right sleeve is the same pink as the outer layer of her star.
 Garnet's original design has asymmetrical two-toned pants; you can create this effect by replacing the right leg of a black pair of leggings with a leg from a dark red pair. If you're not into sewing, you could simply cut off the right leg on the black leggings and wear them over the red.
 You'll need to cut the gloves up a bit, too: they end at the wrist, save for a strip of fabric that goes up and covers the middle finger, leaving most of the hand exposed.


However, you could also leave the palm of the gloves intact to attach gems to. This is possibly the only safe way to include Garnet's gems in this cosplay.
 In this design, Garnet's shades appear to be a pinkish-white, most likely due to their reflectivity. Most darker shades, however, will suit the purpose.
 Garnet's outfit is basically a jumpsuit, so she doesn't technically wear shoes. Jumpsuits like this are rather hard to come by, though, so you'll be best off wearing black boots.

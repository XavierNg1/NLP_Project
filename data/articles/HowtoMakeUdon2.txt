 Udon noodles are just at home in a ramen broth as they are the star of the show, plated cold with veggies, soy sauce, and your meat of choice. While many recipes use Udon as a substitute for ramen noodles, they are thick and versatile enough to carry a dish much like spaghetti does in Italian cuisine. Try it with:

Ginger honey glaze
Ramen broth
Stir fry

Japanese-style curry, There is a lot of chatter about tapioca flour among online chefs, with many recipes swearing by it and just as many saying it's unnecessary. IF you make a lot of udon noodles, give it a try. The flour has a slight sweetness and no gluten in it, meaning the noodles are a bit lighter and less chewy., This will lead to a slower relaxation stage, but it also means you can prepare the noodles in advance and wait until the next day to heat them. The following afternoon, simply remove the dough ball and flatten it, cutting the noodles and cooking like normal.

Note, if the noodles are still cold, they may take an additional minute to cook. It will not, however, be much longer, so stay near the pot.
 Place the cut noodles on a baking sheet and put it in the freezer. Once the dough is hard and frozen, put the noodles in a zip-lock bag and squeeze the air out. These noodles will now last for a few months. When ready to cook them, simply toss them directly into the hot water and cook like normal. Note that they may take a little longer to cook, but not much longer.

 Façade Slaking will have an increased damage of Façade when it is inflicted with a status problem.
 Flame Orb is more advised. These orbs gives you the Poison or Burn status problems when held for one turn.
,,
Bulk Up - Raises Attack and Defense by 1. Good to use when you first send Slaking out as the Flame or Toxic Orb do not activate until one complete turn. So getting the Attack raise will benefit Slaking if it is holding the Flame Orb since Burn lowers Attack.
Pursuit - If the opponent is trying to escape the power of Slaking, predict them with a Pursuit to give the Pokémon switching out lesser HP!
Double-Edge - Powerful move with 33% recoil so be wise on when to use it.

 Damon's got the perfect lean torso and bad-ass smile. Exercise regularly, and lose any excess body fat, while gaining muscle. Make sure that you take care of your smile, also, and have proper hygiene.;
, When women ask you out, get used to it.
 Never make a spiky mountain of hair on the top of your head-that makes you look like a deranged werewolf. Your hair should be smooth and thick; something girls wold love running their fingers through!

, Be confident, and walk boldly. You'll see Damon walk in like the sexy, confident man he is. Pull your shoulders slightly back so you look taller. Looking down at the crowd also gives you an edge over others.
 Relax if you aren't born with a vampire's eyes. Just turn and look into the eyes of the person you're talking to. They'll feel closer and intimidated at the same time. Don't blink nervously; that's a deal-breaker.
 Don't blabber on and on till you bore people to death. Talk when you have to, and keep it short and interesting.
 Damon has no compunctions aggravating vampires much older than him. I'm not saying you'll meet a lot of THOSE in your normal life, but treat bullies just the same. If any idiot insists on challenging you, break away from your group (you're a lot more intimidating with friends) and say all too casually, "you really want to make this personal?"

, Wear slightly somber clothes; typically a t-shirt, a button-down shirt, a black leather jacket, and a pair of comfortable fitted (not skinny) jeans.
 Damon says stuff like, "I DO believe in killing the messenger. You know why? It sends a message."

, Damon is selfish, promiscuous, and hedonistic, though he has been known to reveal his good side to his one and only true love, Elena. But it took Damon centuries to find it. Chances are, you won't have centuries left to live and find true love (but who knows), so live your life to the fullest. After all, that's what Damon would do.

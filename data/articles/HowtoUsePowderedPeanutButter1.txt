 Use a scale or measuring spoons to measure the powdered peanut butter. Level off the tablespoon and dump four of them into a dry mixing bowl.This will be the bowl you'll use to mix your powder into creamy peanut butter.;
, Measure out 2 tbsp (14.78 mL) of water from the faucet, or you can use distilled water from a bottle. Pour the water into the mixing bowl on top of the powder.


The water will pool on top of the powdered peanut butter until you mix it.
 4 tbsp (24.56 grams) of powdered peanut butter will make 2 tsp (12.28 grams) of spreadable peanut butter. Powdered peanut butter will come out to be more gritty in texture to its spreadable counterpart.If your peanut butter is too thick, you can add more water.
 Once you finish the reconstituting process, the peanut butter should be ready to eat. Powdered peanut butter in powder form has a shelf life up to 10-12 months unopened. After you reconstitute your peanut butter, however, you must refrigerate it, and it goes bad in 48 hours.Try to reconstitute the peanut butter as you eat it so that it tastes fresh each time.

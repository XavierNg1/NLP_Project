 Just a few of them could be:


A traumatic event that occurred, most likely when you were enjoying yourself.

People reacting badly to you when you were having fun.;
, Even if no one ever sees it, it will help you get it out of your system.
 Be sure that this person won't be judgmental. It could be a therapist, a friend, or even a stranger.
 Take a walk in the park. Don't ask someone, just go do it. If you exercise due caution, as you should, nothing bad will happen.
, Don't jump into the deep end and attend the Olympics or something. Try going to community get togethers, or attend functions at work. Take baby steps.

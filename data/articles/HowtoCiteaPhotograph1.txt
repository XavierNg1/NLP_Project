 In many cases you will have to obtain permission from the photographer or publisher before publishing a photograph in a magazine, a book or on a website.If you are using the photograph in a paper you are writing that you don't plan to distribute widely or sell, you most likely don't need permission.
Most photographs created before 1922 are permission free, regardless of how they are used.;
, How widely your publication will be circulated will determine the type of rights you need. It will also determine the amount you'll have to pay.


In most cases, the wider the publication circulation and the more prominently the photograph is featured, the more expensive the rights are to obtain.
Again, you likely won't need to pay for permission if you're using the photograph in a paper that won't be circulated.
 Make sure you have written permission stating that you are allowed to use the work within the perimeters you have specified. If payment is required, you should receive a high resolution copy of the photograph to use in your work.
 Obtaining permission and citing the photograph properly will help you avoid a legal dispute down the line.

 Once your dog has learned a command, start to make the rewards a bit unpredictable to keep him motivated. You can do this by rewarding every fourth or fifth time that your dog performs the desired behavior rather than every time. Changing up your dog’s rewards will help to prevent your dog from taking his rewards for granted. It will also help to keep his focus on working to earn a reward., Remember to train often for short periods of time. Each dog has his own concentration span, so work within your dog’s abilities. Your dog may only have enough attention for five minutes of training or he may be able to train for 20 minutes. If your dog starts to lose concentration or starts to make mistakes, then end the session., To help keep our dog motivated and happy, always try to end on a high note by asking your dog to do something simple at the end of your training session. For example, you can ask your dog to perform one of the tricks he has mastered, such as sit or speak. Make sure that you reward your dog with lots of praise and a treat to let him know he is doing a good job., It is helpful to start training your dog in quiet locations where he will not be distracted. Stick to a quiet, distraction-free place until your dog has mastered the trick. Once your dog gets the idea, you can begin to vary your location to reinforce the trick even more.It is important to use different locations so that your dog knows the commands apply wherever he is. For example, if you always ask your dog to “spin” in the kitchen, he may begin to associate spinning in a circle with standing in front of the fridge.

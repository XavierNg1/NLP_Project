 Look for hand carders that have fine needles and carding cloth.;
, Don't take too much; judge how much is good to handle by the size of your carders and your own ability.
 Start on the bottom of one carder brush. Gradually add the angora fiber to the base of one carder brush and build up the amount.
 Fill in the rest of the hand carder brush.
 Start at the bottom and begin passing across the carded fiber from the first carder to the second carder. You will be transferring the angora fiber completely onto the other carder.
 As you are transferring the fiber from one carder to the other, the goal is to really line up the fibers together, in straight rows. Make sure that they are all parallel to each other.
 You should pass the angora fiber between the carders at least three times. When you have a good quality fiber to start with, three times should be sufficient; lesser quality fiber may require more passing.
 Once you start getting close to finishing the carding, check the length of the small fibers. They should be at least 3" / 7.5 centimeter (3.0Â in) in length. That makes the yarn easier to spin, more uniform and better overall.
 Once the fiber is the right length, and very smooth, it is ready to remove from the carder brush for use.

Lay down the carder brush.






Have the fiber facing up.






Take the bottom fiber (opposite to handle side of the carder brush) and roll the fiber off in the direction of the handle.
 Repeat as many times with new clumps of fiber as needed to complete your project.
 When you've made enough to fill your bobbins, commence spinning your yarn.

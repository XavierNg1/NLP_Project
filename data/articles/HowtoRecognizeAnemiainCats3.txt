 The term anemia refers to a reduced number of circulating red blood cells or a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin in the blood. The amount of red blood cells if most commonly discussed in percentage terms.


A normal percentage in the cat is around 33 to 50%. In a given volume of blood this tells you that 33-50% of it is occupied by red blood cells.Red blood cells contain haemoglobin, and indeed the hemoglobin plays a vital role in delivering oxygen to the body's tissue. Deprived of oxygen, organs, muscles and tissue cannot function properly, and leads to clinical signs.
 Anemia is a symptom rather than a diagnosis in its own right. There are many conditions that cause anemia, but the reasons can be proudly broken down into groups:


Anemia because of blood loss: This includes hemorrhage, such as after a traffic accident. There are many ways to lose blood including hemorrhage from gastro-intestinal ulcers, inflamed bowels, parasitism (lice or fleas sucking blood)
Anemia because of damage to red blood cells: Also a form of blood loss, this includes red blood cells being destroyed because of autoimmune disease, parasitism (Mycoplasma felis), or damaged passing through a tumor
Anemia due to lack of blood cell production: Most commonly this is bone marrow disease due to cancer or exhaustion of the bone marrow germ cells. It can also include anemia due to iron deficiency leading to lack of hemoglobin synthesis.
 Determining the cause of the anemia can be a complex and involved process that requires blood tests, blood smears, and imaging such as radiographs, ultrasound, or an MRI scan. However, the first step is to recognize that the cat is anemic.

 Baby mice would ordinarily drink milk from their mother. Instead, you are going to need to provide that “milk” to you baby mouse.Avoid cow's milk. Instead, you might choose:


Baby formula made with soy (diluted slightly).
Kitten formula (diluted slightly).
Goat’s milk.
 Your baby mouse is going to need to eat around the clock until it opens its eyes. For very young mice (0-2 weeks old), you must do this every two hours. After this, they only need to eat every 3-4 hours. Once their eyes are open, they should no longer need to eat during the night.Warm up the milk.
Fill an eyedropper, syringe, or pipette with milk.
Hold the mouse firmly with your non-dominant hand.
Holding the pipette in your other hand, try to shimmy the tip into the mouse's mouth.
Put drop of warm milk in then wait for him to swallow (this looks like stretching out and squirming).
Offer the mouse as much milk as it wants.
 When your mouse’s eyes are open, it can begin to eat some solid food. Continue giving it formula until the 4-6 weeks old, by which time it should be weaned.You may give your mouse:


Hamster food moistened with formula or goat’s milk.
Kitten food (moistened).
Human baby food (homemade or store-bought).
Soft cooked vegetables like squash, peas, or carrots.

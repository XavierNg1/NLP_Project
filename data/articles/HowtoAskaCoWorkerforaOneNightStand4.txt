 Maintain your regular office routines and be cautious about how you behave around other coworkers. While at work, do not go out of your way to be overly attentive or nice to your “special” coworker. Do not openly flirt with your coworker as this can cause suspicion among other coworkers.
Do not email or instant message your coworker at work about the encounter or personal matters. Limit your conversations to strictly business matters.
 Agree to keep things secret by not telling other coworkers about the affair. If you have to tell someone about the affair, make sure it is a friend who has no connection to your work place.


One of the biggest mistakes you can make here is by posting about the affair on Facebook. Remember, once something is on Facebook, it is hard to take it back., If caught while trying to keep things secret, be prepared to deal with backlash. Have a risk management strategy by thinking ahead about how to mitigate, minimize, and/or manage the situation.


Log more hours at the office.
Take on new responsibilities and projects.
Be proactive about promoting your accomplishments.
 If your boss confronts you about the situation, do not lie about it. Own up to it and offer valid solutions. If it was a one-time thing, let your boss know it is over. If it has developed into something more serious, don’t offer to end the affair but do let your boss know that you are sorry that they did not hear it from you first.

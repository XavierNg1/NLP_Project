 The benefits of making it usually outweigh buying the product. A benefit is that you know what is going in the product, and can avoid things that your horse might be allergic to. It is also simple. You will save money, as most horse glitter gels are around 25 dollars for a 4oz bottle. You can make as much as you want, because it is cheap to make.
 Spot test on your horse's coat to make sure that your horse is not allergic to it. You also need to buy a packet of loose glitter. You can also add as much as you want to the tub of hair gel. If you just want fine glitter, add a little bit, and add a lot if you want more. Keep the horse glitter gel in the tub of hair gel. This is a benefit as it is easy to get a brush or a finger in the tub and it comes with a cool screw on lid!

 Make sure that they are symmetrical and that they are mirror images of each other.
 Also, do each shape in the stencil individually. Start with the design closest to the top of the horse, use a paint brush to spread the Elmer's glue into the stencil after filling in the shape sprinkle in the glitter.
, Then leave the stencils on for about 10 minutes to dry., A big disappointment. This was just a big mess. I wish I had tried it out before the day of the parade.

 The most common way to fix a harelip or cleft palate is to undergo surgery. The vet will repair the defects and fix the soft palate. This surgery should happen as soon as possible to ensure that your kitten thrives. Surgery on the soft palate occurs after your kitten is three months old, and surgery on the hard palate is usually after six months.The vet will close the hard and soft palate, which may take two different surgeries.
If the defect is too bad, the vet may suggest euthanasia.
 If the kitten has developed pneumonia, sinusitis, or another secondary infection, the vet will prescribe antibiotics. These antibiotics will clear up the infection. You must monitor the kitten during this time to make sure they don’t have any complications from the infection.For example, you want to make sure the cat can breathe and doesn’t develop any additional breathing problems.
 The kitten will need to be monitored closely after the surgery to ensure they heal and thrive. The kitten may have to eat through a feeding tube at first, but then will have to eat soft food for a few weeks.The kitten will need to wear an e-collar for a few days to keep them from touching their face.
No hard toys or food should be given to the kitten for weeks after the surgery. Wait until the vet gives the okay for the kitten to put hard objects in their mouth.

 Many cats hide because they are scared or stressed. If you are trying to acclimatize a new cat to your home, letting them hide for a bit can help them feel more secure. If there’s no urgent reason to make them come out, don’t try to rush them., Your cat may feel overwhelmed if they are in a new space that is larger than what they are used to. Limiting your cat’s “territory” to a single room may help them feel safer and encourage them to come out of hiding and explore., Minimize noise in the room, and keep children and other pets out until your cat is feeling less nervous and overwhelmed. Try playing some soothing classical music to give the cat a gentle sound to focus on and distract them from other, more alarming noises., Purchase a bottle of Feliway or a similar product designed to reduce cat anxiety from your vet or pet supply store. Treat the room with the spray. Put a treated towel in a cardboard box, or spritz a little spray on a cat bed, and put it near your bed., Don’t try to soothe or pet the cat while they are hiding, or you may inadvertently reinforce the hiding behavior. Ignore the cat until they start to emerge, then offer praise, affection, or treats.

 Using a pencil, start creating a solution for your puzzle. Work with each number in order so that you can be sure your solution is valid. Don’t forget how the game works, or you’ll end up with an incorrect solution.Remember the rules. To win sudoku, the player must fill the grid so that each row contains the number 1-9, each column contains the numbers 1-9 and each 3x3 box contains the numbers 1-9.Start filling in the number 1. Place a number one in each 3x3 box, each row and each column. Make sure that that you don’t place two number ones in any column, row or 3x3 box.
Move on to the number 2. Begin to place the number 2 in each column, row and 3x3 square. As with the number one, make sure you don’t double up your number 2s.
Continue with each number consecutively. Keep adding the number 3, the number 4 and so on to each row, column and 3x3 box. As you fill in more numbers, the boxes will become easier to fill because you’ll have fewer and fewer spaces left.
 Creating your solution might become frustrating. You can easily back yourself into a corner, where you’ll find that you can only fill a row or column with a duplicate number. If you end up stuck, erase a few of the problem digits and start the section over again.
 Make sure that your solution is correct by checking for duplicate numbers. It may take a while to go through each 3x3 block, row and column, but make sure that they each contain the numbers 1-9 with no duplicate digits.

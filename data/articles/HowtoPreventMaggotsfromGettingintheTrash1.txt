 All species of fly produce maggots which are also called fly larvae but not all flies lay their eggs in trash or rotting meat. Fruit flies are the ones that lay eggs in fruit such as apples. Bee fly larvae are parasitic and eat the larvae of other insects. The ones that lay eggs in trash are called filth flies.


Blow fly, family Calliphoridae are commonly referred to bottle flies. This nickname comes from their coloring, which can be iridescent blue, green or copper. They can be rather pretty but their maggots can reach full size within 3 days after being laid as eggs by the female. They reproduce rapidly during the warm weather. Some species also have an adaptable appetite for sweets as well, which is why they are found feeding on flower nectar and leftover sugars on food containers.



 



House fly, Musca domestica is very easily recognizable by it's dull gray to brown body. Females live for about 3 to 4 weeks before laying 60 to 100 eggs. They reproduce less abundantly than blow flies but also will cause maggots in manure and rotting vegetation.







Little house fly, Fannia Canicularis is similar to the house fly but smaller. Their life cycle is 3 to 4 weeks. They also rest with wings held to together.

Stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans and False stable fly, Muscina Stabulans look similar to house flies but have checkerboard markings and are smaller. Stable fly has a painful bite as well as sucks blood from mammals and False Stable Fly does not. These species can live for 17 to 50 days and lay eggs in soiled pet bedding and food dishes. The False Stable fly also lays eggs in dead insects and bird nests to feed it's parasitic larvae. Both can lay eggs in tainted meat products as well.;

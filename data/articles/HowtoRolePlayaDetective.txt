 Get a bag or black box or even a briefcase and fill it with all the necessary things a spy might need. This includes:


magnifying glass or a pocket magnifying glass
talcum powder (for dusting fingerprints)
binoculars
a notebook (for making profiles of your targets)
tweezers
test tubes
small and large zip-lock bags
a voice disguise machine
a ski mask
gloves
sunglasses
a flashlight;
, It's always more fun with a friend. Make sure you can trust them with your secrets and master plan. If you have a group, try creating a few missions and assigning each "agent" to each mission.
 Choose a target, find a lead, and create a master plan (with a back up, of course).
 Your pen should be fully inked, your flashlight should have a full battery, your tape recorder should have tape in it, etc. Go on a practice run before the mission, just to make sure everything will go as planned. If you have enough friends with you, you can even make a "spy training school".
 This can be as complex as a hidden room behind a bookshelf or as simple as a cardboard box in the alleyway. It's always fun to have a secret base, and it encourages you to continue role-playing.
 You'll look back on this when you're older and will want to remember your daring feats of stealth.

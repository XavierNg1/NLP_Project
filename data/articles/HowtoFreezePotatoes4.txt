 Large potatoes serve one person each, but you'll need 3 or 4 smaller potatoes per person.
 Make them as small or as large as you want them, depending on your preferences for potato salad. Boil them in water until fork-tender (as shown above), but do not overcook.
 Allow them to drain.


The water from the potatoes will drain into the bowl.






When the potatoes have drained, discard the water.






Place the potatoes in a mixing bowl and set aside to cool.
 In a small bowl, whisk together the following ingredients, adding more or less of each one to taste:

1/2 cup mayonnaise






1/4 cup white vinegar






1/2 teaspoon garlic powder






1/2 teaspoon salt






1/2 teaspoon black pepper







, Make sure each potato is well coated in dressing. Add the following ingredients of your choosing:


Chopped hard-boiled eggs






Chopped green or red peppers






Minced green onion, chives or shallots







, Serve at a picnic, or alongside barbecue or another summer dish.

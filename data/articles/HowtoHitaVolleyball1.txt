 To hit an overhand serve, you need to stand with your feet about shoulder width apart with the foot opposite your hitting hand slightly forward. You should have your hips squared off to the net.


Most of your weight should be on your back foot.;
, An overhand serve requires you to toss the ball with your less dominant arm so you can hit it with your dominant arm. This step takes lots of practice to be able to toss the ball in the best position to be hit. Toss the ball in front of your hitting arm and about two to four feet above your head.








Being consistent with your toss is what will make you a good server, so be sure to practice this frequently.
 Spread your fingers really wide and make contact with the ball with the palm of your hand. Contact the ball in the center and try to hit it when the ball is high enough to go straight over the net.









In an upperhand serve, the trajectory of the ball should be straight.
Make sure to follow through after hitting the ball so that your arm is extended out straight towards the net.

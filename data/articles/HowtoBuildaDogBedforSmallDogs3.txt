 If you don't have an old end table to use, check thrift stores, flea markets, or online classified ads to find one. Make sure that the table top is large enough to create a suitable bed base for your small dog. The more ornate the legs of the table, the fancier the posts on your dog bed will be., Flip over the table, which will now be the base of your dog bed. Sand the wood if there are any splinters or rough parts. Paint or finish the wood to your liking, if desired., If you wish to make your dog's four post bed look more regal, purchase bun feet at a hardware store to add to the bottom. Use a drill to make holes in each corner of the table. Firmly screw in the bun feet, ensuring that the base of the dog bed is solid. If desired, decorate the bun feet to match the rest of the bed., As a finishing touch, add a comfortable cushion or pillow to the base of the bed. Make sure the cushioning is thick enough to be supportive. To prevent slipping, use a glue gun to attach the bottom of the pillow to the base of the dog bed.

 Butternut squash skin is soft and edible once cooked, so feel free to skip this step.
 Use a large, sturdy knife for this, as squash is hard to work with.
 This will keep it from sticking, as you will not add other liquids to the baking dish.
 Sprinkle with salt and toss to coat well. As a maple syrup alternative, you can use sugar or honey.









For an extra layer of flavor, use any of the following spices: cinnamon, pumpkin pie blend, apple pie blend, ginger, or allspice.
 Serve as a side dish.

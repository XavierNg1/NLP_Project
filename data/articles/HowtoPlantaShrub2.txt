 Always move B&B shrubs by the roots, not the trunk or branches of the plant. This can damage or kill the shrub. Gently place the rootball into the hole keeping the shrub vertical. The root flare should be at or slightly above the natural ground level.The hole should be as deep as the distance between the root flare and the ground.
The hole should be between three and five times wider than the rootball., After the rootball is in the hole, remove as much of these containing materials as possible. While most burlap will disintegrate, it will still impede root growth for several weeks, so it’s better to remove burlap in the beginning. Don’t worry about pulling burlap or wire from below the rootball. These will not affect the ability of roots to grow., Keep adjusting the plant to ensure it stays vertical, and return the soil the hole a few inches at a time. Hold the bush gently and tamp down the dirt with your foot as you refill. Stomp lightly to make sure there are no large air pockets in the dirt, but you don’t want to make the soil so dense it blocks root growth. Continue the process until the entire hole is filled in.


Don’t add fertilizer, peat moss, mulch or other amendments to the natural soil.
Remove any rocks or debris from the soil as you refill.
Create a small ring of raised dirt around the hole to direct water inward to the root system.
Leave a ring around the trunk free of dirt where water can collect and drain down to the roots., Allow the water to soak into the soil for several hours after you plant it, but do not over water. Water the shrub once a week. Dig down two inches. If the soil at this level is moist, you are done watering.

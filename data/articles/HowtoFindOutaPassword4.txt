 This will usually be somewhere below (or in the general vicinity of) the "Password" field.
 Most accounts will allow you to reset your password in one or more of the following ways:


By receiving a password link via phone (SMS)
By receiving a password link via email
By answering security questions

, This is where knowing as much about the password creator as possible will come in handy. Failing that, you'll need physical access to the password creator's phone or email address.


If they use an iOS device that's synced to the computer you're on, you may be able to view the password reset link in the Mac's messages. This is a risky move since it also alerts the password creator that you're altering the password.
 As long as you have everything you need to successfully receive the password reset link (or to answer the security questions), you should be able to reset the password, thereby gaining access to the account.

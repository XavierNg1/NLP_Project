 Before you go off hacking, you will need to download a port-scanner. One of the most powerful and free port-scanners is nmap. If possible make sure you install the GUI with it. It comes with the Windows installer.;
, When you download nmap, "Zenmap GUI" will also be downloaded along with it. Open this once you find this, put the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you want to hack in the "Target" box. Say you want to scan a range of IP addresses, then you would type the beginning IP address followed by (no spaces) a dash ( - ) and the end of the last IP address. For example, if you wanted to scan 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.299 then you would type 192.168.1.100-299 . In the "Profile" menu of Zenmap, select "Intense scan" if it is not already selected. Click scan and watch as the program scans the computer or device for open ports. Watch the nmap output until you see some words in green. These are the open ports on the computer or device. If port 23 is open, the device is hackable, if there is no password set.
 For Windows, click Start -> Run (or Windows Key + R) and type telnet in the box. This will open a telnet screen.
, If you don't type a port number, it will assume you mean 23. Now hit enter to connect.
 Basically just fool around with the system here.

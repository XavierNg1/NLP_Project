 You want to make sure the clothespins are placed directly next to each other (touching sides) so you donâ€™t see the can underneath.
 Of course beforehand make sure the container will fit. If you are using the holder for candles use a glass holder (plastic will melt).
 This may mean that you either add dirt first and then plant seeds or you can transfer a plant directly from the temporary pot to your new holder.

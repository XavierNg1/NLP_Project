 This kiss creates major anticipation in an already-hot moment. First, you and your partner should part your lips slightly, and barely touch them. Begin to share your partner's breath. You can move your heads to experience different sensations, and touch your lips on and off slightly. This is a teasing kiss that will leave both of you wanting more and will make you feel very sexy.

Remember that hot breath is different from cool breath. Breathing from your throat will create hot breath, while blowing through your lips will create cool air.






Obviously, both partners should have fresh breath before they jump into this kiss.
 This can be tricky, but rewarding. First, your partner should hold his breath underwater. Next, he should pull you down. You should join him with lungs full of air. Gently begin to kiss him, and share your air with him.

When you get this method down, switch and be the person who is underwater first.






Be careful with this one. You could end up choking on water. Start your kiss by parting your lips just a tiny bit.
 This is a playful kiss. Kiss your partner with an open mouth, and suck in so deeply that you're sucking away your partner's air.


Fresh breath is also a must for this one.

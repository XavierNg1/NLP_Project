 Sometimes your need for space can be more serious than simply “needing to recharge.” If the actions of someone upset you and that is why you want space from them, wait until you’ve cooled off to let them know.You will be more level-headed and better able to articulate why you need space.
 Especially if the conversation may grow heated, it is a good idea to rehearse the conversation ahead of time.Start by making an outline of your most important points. What do you need your friend to know?
Once you have your outline, practice speaking in the mirror.
You can always bring the outline with you if you think you may forget an important point.
 No matter how you go about it, the important thing is just to say what you need to say. Preparation is only effective up to a point. After that, you have to take the leap. Don’t over think it and don’t put it off. Just pick up the phone and call., If you feel that your friend is frequently overwhelming your space or if you don’t feel like your requests for space are being heard, you may need to set some boundaries.Healthy boundaries are the foundation of a healthy friendship.


Explain which behaviors are okay, and which others are not.
For example, maybe it is okay for them to email or call, but not okay from them to drop by unannounced.
If you want to sever the friendship permanently, it is important to voice it.
 Your need for space will not evaporate. When you need space, make sure you get it. Subtle approaches may work sometimes, and at others you may need to be more direct, but chances are, you will need to assert your need for space more than once. Keep at it! Claiming the space you need is a powerful act of self-love!

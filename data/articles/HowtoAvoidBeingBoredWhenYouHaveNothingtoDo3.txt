 Exercising may not be easy to start, but once you "get in the rhythm" you might start enjoying yourself, or at least be glad you're doing something instead of sitting around bored. If push-ups, sit-ups, and similar exercises bore you, try out a physical activity such as dancing, yoga, or running.


People who exercise with someone with a similar fitness level and similar fitness goals are more likely to enjoy themselves and stick to regular exercise., If you can get a whole group of friends together, try an outdoor game such as ultimate frisbee or red rover, or capture the flag.


If you enjoy spending time with people and frequently get bored and lonely on the weekends, try organizing a weekly sports club.
Contact your local parks and recreation department and ask about local sports leagues for both children and adults. They are usually low key, weekly games that get you out of the house easily.
 Getting out of the house can often help get rid of boredom. Pack a few sandwiches and take a walk, go on a hike, or have a bike ride. This may clear your head and stop you feeling stir crazy.


On a hike or other longer trip outdoors, try bringing a book to keep yourself entertained if you get tired or bored of physical activity. Leaving electronic entertainment devices behind is recommended, however, as they make it difficult to enjoy natural surroundings.
 Tending plants is very relaxing and makes you feel connected to the earth, and they require almost daily care. Go to your local hardware store to pick up seeds and topsoil and build your garden, or purchase potted plants to care for.


Water your plants every 1-2 days.
Buying fruit or vegetable plants is a great way to mix up your diet with new foods.

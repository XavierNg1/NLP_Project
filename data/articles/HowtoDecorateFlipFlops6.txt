, Choose a color that works with the flip flops and that you like.


You may like to mix and match colors. For example, the tri-colors of blue, red and white can be ideal for a national day theme in various countries, etc.
Other fluffy style fabric or ribbon can be used in place of tulle.
 Each strip should be the same length. The length should allow enough space for tying in place and being fluffed out to stand up. Too short and it can't be tied properly, too long and it'll just flop over.
 Start from the center and tie them back as far as you want to have them.


Keep each strip snugly fitting next to the one already tied in place, all the way around.
 Make them stand upright for the finished look.


Note, these will all flop down when wet but can be easily revived to stand upright again once they've dried out.

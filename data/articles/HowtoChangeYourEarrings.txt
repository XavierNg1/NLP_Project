 Place the earring post and any backings in a small amount of rubbing alcohol. Leave it on the side for a few minutes. You may also use unscented anti-bacterial soap instead of rubbing alcohol.;
, If your earring comes with a backing, remove that first before attempting to remove the post from your ear. Earrings without backings, such as french hooks, can easily be removed by sliding the curve out of the ear.
 Use it to disinfect your ear holes, including the back.

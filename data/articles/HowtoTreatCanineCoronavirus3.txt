 Dogs become infected with the canine coronavirus by coming into contact with feces or saliva of dogs with a coronavirus infection. This can be through a food bowl, the feces of an infected dog, or direct contact with an infected dog.Try to prevent the coronavirus in your dog by getting him vaccinated and keeping him away from areas where dogs go to the bathroom.
Adult dogs may develop diarrhea and possibly a reduced appetite, but often the infection is asymptomatic and the dog shows no signs because the immune system has successfully defended the body against the virus. This means your dog can come in contact with an infected dog without you knowing it.
 Those dogs at greatest risk are puppies under 12 weeks of age. Puppies are more vulnerable to dehydration, and because their immune system is still developing and therefore weak, the virus has a greater impact and the diarrhea can be more severe.


Take care with puppies to make sure they have limited contact with anything that could spread the coronavirus., Coronavirus is not fatal for most dogs. Many dogs even have an immunity to the virus. If the dog is in good health, the virus becomes an inconvenience. Diarrhea is the most common symptom for puppies or adults, and it lasts for a few days before the dog recovers.If the dog has a weak immune system, CCV can be a much worse condition. For example, puppies and older dogs are more vulnerable to complications.

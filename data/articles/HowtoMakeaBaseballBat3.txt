 Use a cloth dipped in the wood stain of your choice to apply a stain to the bat. Rub the stain on the bat while the lathe is running to ensure even application.


Apply two coats of stain to the bat.
Allow the bat to dry between coats.
You can also apply a lacquer finish to help preserve the stain and surface of the bat.
 Use a wax such as Min-Wax paste to finish the surface of the bat. Buff the wax on the bat while the lathe is running.
 The bit of wood that connects the bat to the remaining wood on the lathe is called a tenon. Make it as small as possible without breaking.


Place the parting tool perpendicular to the spinning bat.
Insert the tip of the parting tool into the spinning bat at the bottom of the knob and top of the barrel.
Reduce the diameter of the tenon to 1/4 of an inch in diameter.
 Once the bat is removed from the lathe you can use a hacksaw to remove the tenons from either end of the bat.
 Apply the finishing touches to the ends of the bat after removing the tenons.


Sand each end of the bat with increasing grits of sandpaper.
Apply varnish and wax to the ends of the bat

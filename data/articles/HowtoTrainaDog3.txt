 This is important not just for training, but for his physical and mental health. Depending on what breed of dog you have, he may need a lot of exercise to keep him happy and in shape.
 Most dogs will pull on the leash when they're learning to take walks. When he starts pulling, stop immediately. Don't take another step until the dog comes to your side and focuses his attention on you.
 An even more effective method is to walk in the opposite direction and encourage your dog to come with you. Once he's caught up, praise and treat him.
 Your dog's natural impulse is to chart his own course and investigate his environment. You need to make walking by your side more appealing that that. Use an enthusiastic voice when changing directions, and lavish him with praise when he comes back to your side.
 Once the dog walks consistently at your side, you can give the behavior a name, like “heel" or “let’s go.”

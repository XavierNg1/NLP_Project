 Locate your wire and cut it to the desired length. You don’t want too much slack, so try anywhere from 3 inches to a foot. This wire will connect the switch to the capacitor. You’ll also need to strip the wire from the rubber casing.
 Solder the wire to one of the two terminals of the capacitor. Use a quality soldering gun to avoid a messy circuit board. Solder a blob of lead free rosin core to the surface. Then heat the wire to the blob with your soldering gun. It should dry shortly to create a firm connection. 







, Take the wire you just soldered to the capacitor and attach it to the “off” side of the switch. You might need to solder the wire onto the switch, but most switches you buy have screwable ports for wires.
 Wrap a strip of tape around your circular object with the adhesive side facing outward until it overlaps. Now take the enamel coated wire and wrap it 7-15 times. Leave some wire out to attach to the terminals. Don’t overlap any of the coil. Take time and be precise. Make sure the wire is snug and that there aren’t any spatial gaps.









Coat the finished wiring with tape so it’s secure.
Slide the windings off the object.
Cut the terminals of the coils to the desired length, but make sure you leave yourself enough room to work with., Using sandpaper, file down the tips of the wire to remove the enamel coat. This will create a stronger bond between the components.
 Attach a strand of coil to the other terminal of the capacitor. Use care and don’t create a mess.









Solder onto the opposite side of the switch.
 Connect one of the leads of the coil to the other “on” terminal of the switch., Make sure your battery for the device is charged and in place. Test the device on a handheld video game. Newer models might not work. Insert the electronic device into the circular coil and flip the switch.

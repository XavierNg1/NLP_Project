 For a list of .wiki registrars, do an online search. To register through GoDaddy, visit “www.godaddy.com/tlds/wiki”. Other registrars include 1&1, KeySystems, and Web.com.
 Most registrars will have an availability checker, where you type in the domain name you want and they confirm whether or not the name is available. Some even suggest alternative names if the one you entered is taken., Shorter domain names are better, as these are easier to read, type, and remember. Be memorable. If someone is going to learn about your website by word of mouth, you'll want it to be something that's easy to remember., When you select your domain name, you will also have the opportunity to add on other services that the host also provides., You can use the registrar’s tools to build and host your website if you wish, or use your own knowledge and tools instead.

Many .wiki websites will use MediaWiki software. For installing MediaWiki, visit "https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Installing_MediaWiki".
 Find creative ways to drive readers and potential contributors to your .wiki website. Spend a lot of time encouraging collaboration because that's the heart and soul of the wiki movement.

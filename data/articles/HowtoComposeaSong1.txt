 Before you begin composing your song, you will need to consider what it is for. What the purpose of the song is, what type of song it is, will significantly impact the writing process. You should plan accordingly.


If you will be writing a song with lyrics, you will need to consider that while you are writing the song. There are many different ways to go about incorporating lyrics into a song. You can begin with lyrics or words which you set the music to, write the lyrics after writing the melody, or you can try to write both together. It will depend on your skill and style. You will also want to consider the style of music and be sure that it fits the lyrics you are working with and vice versa.
If you will be writing background music, theme music, or some other type of instrumental music, you will need to plan this accordingly as well. Think about what you are writing the music for and what mood you want to convey. Appropriate instruments and music styles will be needed to create the necessary mood, since words wonâ€™t be used.;
, Some people will compose entirely from their own mind and will only sing or hum a part if they need to get an idea of how it sounds. Others, especially when writing a piece to be played on a specific instrument, will use that instrument while composing in order to try out how certain things sounds. Think about if you want or need an instrument with you in order to compose and plan accordingly.


Common types of instruments used while composing songs include guitars and pianos, though some people will use certain string or band instruments.
 Consider how you will be writing the music down, in both final format and while you are working. Those with more musical training will want to write sheet music, whereas those who have less may want to write out tabs or chords. If you are writing only for yourself and have a very good memory, it may be possible not to write anything at all (but this is not recommended).

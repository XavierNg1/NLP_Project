 Search engines use "spiders" to crawl around the web on existing links, looking for new ones. There are several ways to get a spider to weave a web to your site.


If you already have a blog or another website that is indexed, put a link to your new website, and don't bury it. Make it big and bold. You want people to see it, to click it, and to visit your site!
Ask somebody with an indexed website to link to your website. It could be as simple as an embedded reference, or an ad for your product. The more people linked to your website, the better, so don't be shy if you want to self-promote.
Submit your website to popular social bookmarking sites like Digg and Stumbleupon.
Submit your website to the Open Directory Project (ODP). (See how Open Directory Project shows in blue? That's the link back to dmoz.org, the ODP site). ODP is a multilingual open content directory of links that is reviewed and maintained by volunteer editors.
Include a link to your new site on your Facebook page and Twitter profile. In fact, put a link on every website you can. This will not only ensure you get indexed quickly, it will help you raise your search rank as well, through what's called Search Engine Optimization.

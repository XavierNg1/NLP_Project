 Don't irritate somebody if you don't know whether they'll chase you. Chances are if you're prepared, you can combat them easily.;
, When they try to run at you, just jump out of the way over on top of their head.
 If you have a weapon of your own, perform the jump step and then attack them from behind.
 Okay, this might not be considered winning, but it gets them off your back. Create a path using blocks you move and jump on it with them. While they try to attack you on it, quickly delete it and you both die.
 Pick up a block and then create a small wall out of it to give you some time to escape their clutches.

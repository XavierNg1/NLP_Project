 If you have a well-trained dog, you can simply direct it to stay away from the grill with a command. This will probably be hard for a dog that is food motivated, as the smells coming from the grill will be enticing. However, if you know your dog well and you are confident in its training, then a command may be all you need to do.


The exact command you use will vary. Some people will use a "stay" command to keep the dog in place. Others will have more specific commands to direct the dog's behavior.
 While you may be distracted by conversation or getting another drink, your dog will be attracted to the smells coming from the grill.To keep your dog safe, you need to always have someone at the grill. This is the most effective way to keep a loose dog away from a hot grill.


Telling a dog to get away from the grill or shooing it off may get tiring for you or the person at the grill. If you plan on a long session of grilling, you may want to find a better solution.
 Briquettes, however, can be very attractive, and very dangerous, to a dog.


Even if the briquettes are no longer warm when they are ingested by your dog, they can get stuck in your dog's digestive system and they may require surgery to remove.
 In order to keep your dog away from the grill, you may need to keep it contained while you are grilling. This may mean putting it in the house or tying it up away from the grill. Whatever you need to do to make sure it doesn't burn itself on the grill.


Avoiding a potentially hazardous situation altogether is usually the best solution. If you are worried about your dogs health and safety at a barbecue, then perhaps you should just leave it safely at home.

,,,, This file will look like Minecraft.jar or simply say Minecraft (hover over it to make sure it is a JAR file). You can use WinRAR or any similar program capable of opening these compressed folders to access the files inside.
 Place a new folder somewhere where you can easily identify it and give it a distinctive name (this will be the name for the new texture pack). Copy all of the folders, as well as the other necessary files (pack.png and .txt, particles.png, and terrain.png) to the new folder.
 You should now have access to all of the Minecraft textures. Explore them to find what you want to edit. Edit them by right clicking, selecting “Open with...” and choosing your editing program of choice.

 If you are writing an essay in APA style, you must remember to spell out all numbers under ten. When you reach ten, begin using numbers rather than numerals. For example, you would write:


“One” or “five”, but you would use numbers for 10 and above.
 You should also use numbers when you are writing down a percent, though you can use the ‘%’ sign, rather than writing out percent. For example:


”22 inches (55.9 cm)”.
”72%”.
 If you must begin a sentence with a number, write the number out. However, if possible, try to avoid beginning a sentence with a number. For example:


“Twenty-two tomatoes need to be purchased” could be written as “We need to purchase 22 tomatoes”.
 If you are writing a date, address, or a sentence about money, use numbers rather than numerals. If you are writing out common fractions, use words to write out the fraction. For example:


September 20, 2014.
2489 29th Avenue.
“I paid $4.07.”
Two-thirds, or three-fourths.

 Reconsider the stereotype of modular homes. In recent year modular homes have become more and more popular among home builders. When many people think of modular homes they think of trailer units that are towed to a site and then connected together. However, the modern modular home is something entirely different. The major advantage of modular homes is they can be assembled in the controlled environment of a factory and then delivered in pieces to the site. This saves on building time, overall cost, and the mess left by a traditional stick built home. Modular homes are also said to be built sturdier than traditional homes because they have to withstand the delivery process. This means that you can get a less expensive, sturdier home in less time than a traditional building.



You need to make sure that you have clearance for the building to be delivered.
You will need to arrange for your water, electric, and sewer to be run to your building and you will also need to hook it up when building is in place.
For larger double wide buildings, or a building set up off the ground on a foundation a crane rental is necessary.
Buildings are customizable, and it is possible to accommodate any ideas or options that you would like to incorporate. You are limited in the size buildings that can be made because everything is hauled down the road fully assembled, and needs to be careful of height and width restrictions.

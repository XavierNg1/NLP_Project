 This is one way of determining whether or not he weighs on your thoughts when he’s not around; it’s one thing to make room for someone in your life, but it’s another thing to entirely make room for him in your mind.
 Do you find yourself attracted to him even if he has food in his teeth, or has helmet hair? Or does your attraction wax and wane depending on how well he grooms himself for you?

, Wanting to compliment him to your friends and include him in your family is a major vote of confidence. On the other hand, if you don’t feel secure about a relationship, you may subconsciously find excuses not to introduce or discuss him.


Do you include him in family plans, such as inviting him on your family vacation (or even simply assuming that he will accompany your family without needing an invitation)?
Do you want to help him get along with his family (or even stick up for him) because it’s important that they like you?
Do you suggest that he should call your mother if he needs advice on cooking, cleaning, etc.?

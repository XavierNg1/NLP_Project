 Having a user profile will allow you to save your progress.


From the Main Menu, click Options >> Driver Profile >> New Driver.
Enter the name you would like to use for your Driver in the dialog box that appears and click “OK.”
Click “OK” once again to confirm creation of the new Driver name.
Click “Back” at the bottom of the Driver Profile page to exit to the Main Menu.
 Winning each Hot Pursuit race unlocks the two races below it on the challenge tree. You can open the challenge tree and launch races as follows:


On the Main Menu, select “Hot Pursuit.” This will open the Hot Pursuit challenge tree, which contains icons for different races. Icons that are grayed out represent locked races that cannot be entered unless the races above them on the tree are won first.
Start a race by by clicking a race icon that is not grayed out. Try your best to win the race. After you win that race, the two races below it on the tree will unlock and can be entered. You can launch them by clicking their icons.
Repeat this step until you win the last race on the tree, thereby becoming the ultimate NFSHP road racer and completing the single player mode!

, Do this every time you win a race:


Go to the Driver Profile page (Main Menu >> Options >> Driver Profile), and click “Update Driver Profile.”
Click “OK” on the confirmation dialog box that comes up. This will save your progress, ensuring you can always resume your game from that point.
 Do not get discouraged if you have to redo the harder races more than once or twice. You can retry races an infinite number of times.

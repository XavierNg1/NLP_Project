 You can cut out images from magazines, but keep in mind that carefully ripped pieces actually flatten out better with decoupage glue. This may give your frame a more finished, professional look.


Some people like to upcycle pretty party napkins. Decoupage will work best with 2-ply napkins. Trace around designs that you like with a wet artist’s brush, and use the wet lines as perforations to tear out your pieces.
Keep in mind that you will have to glue these pieces later. Don’t make your cutouts so intricate that they will tear when they are being glued.
 Apply the glue to the back of the paper, and then stick the paper to the frame. If you are using very delicate paper, apply glue to the frame, and then apply the paper to the glue.


If you are applying the paper to a frame with molding, you can go over the top of the pieces with a wet artists’ brush and use a stippling motion to better accentuate the molding., Use a foam brush to apply glue to the top of the paper. Foam brushes do not leave brush marks, so they are ideal. You can find these at any craft store or home improvement store.


You can also use a wide brush if you apply the glue in light coats.

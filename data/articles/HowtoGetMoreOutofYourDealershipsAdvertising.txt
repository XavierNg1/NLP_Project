 Each ad should contain the same call-to-action code or other identifier so that you will learn which ad campaigns generated the most leads.


A specific special or discount, such as 15 percent off one item or a free trinket with each purchase, is a good choice for this. The discount will help people to remember and the different discounts will clearly identify which marketing initiative brought a customer in.;
, Don't just present your name and what you do. Rather, invite people to come in -- maybe even on a specific day -- to specifically buy what you have to offer.
 Use that information to create a "tickler list" that sends advice, advertising or other news to all list members every 1 to 2 months.


Contacting people on your "tickler list" less often won't keep your name in their minds. Contacting more often risks annoying them and getting filed as "spam" in their minds.
 All marketing initiatives will take a while to develop traction. If you abandon your dealership advertising every 4 to 6 weeks, you'll always be stuck in that development phase.


If you need to cut back, buy smaller instances of your existing dealership advertising rather than cancelling a specific ad. For example, you can cut a radio spot from 30 seconds to 15, or reduce a newspaper ad from 1/4 page to 1/8 page.
 Make your marketing initiatives going forward based on what has worked in the past.

 Check to be sure the container is fully sealed. Submerge the entire container in a bowl or sink full of cold water. Using cold water helps the milk thaw evenly., When you start seeing signs of thawing, replace the cold water with room temperature water. After a few minutes, you can replace the room temperature water with warm water until the milk reaches room temperature. The entire process should take about an hour or two for a two- to four-ounce portion of milk.
 If you store the milk in the refrigerator, be sure to use it within 24 hours! You can put on a new date label so you don't forget to use it. Donâ€™t re-freeze thawed milk, it can incubate harmful microbes that can be dangerous for your baby.

 Once you enter build mode, look for a small, square menu in the space where your sim's age and the Play/Pause/FF options were. There will be six smaller squares and one rectangle inside of this menu. Find the square with the hammer, and click it.


If you put your mouse on the square with the hand (which is at the top left of this menu), go down one square, and then one square to the right to find the hammer tool. It should be above the rectangle on the right in the second row.;
, Click and drag to delete long sections of wall. Be careful and precise, but bear in mind that you can always undo your mistakes.
 If you click the wrong wall, you can always undo. Move your mouse back to the hammer box, but don't click it. Move your mouse straight down, past the rectangle, until you reach the square with the arrow pointing to the right (sort of like this "->"). Then move your mouse one square to the left so that it's on the arrow pointing to the left ("<-" like that). Click the left pointing arrow to undo what you did. Click the arrow pointing right to redo it, in case you clicked undo one too many times.
 To exit build mode, find the box near the left side of the screen that shows the paint roller and the saw (the one you clicked to enter build mode). Move your mouse up - past the square with the chair and lamp - until you reach the square with the little buildings, which will be the first one in the little menu. Clicking this will take you back to game mode so you can continue playing.

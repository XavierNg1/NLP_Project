 Start by making a chain of 12 stitches. If you want the ring to be larger, then you can make the chain longer. Measure it around your finger to see what feels comfortable.To make the first chain, loop the yarn over your hook twice and pull the first loop through the second loop. Then, yarn over the hook once and pull through to continue making the chain.;
, Go to the second link in your chain and do a half double crochet stitch into that chain. Then, continue to half double crochet to the end of the chain.To do a half double crochet stitch, yarn over the hook and insert the hook into the first single crochet stitch. Then, yarn over and pull the yarn through the first loop on the hook and yarn over again. Then, pull the yarn through all three loops to complete the stitch., Secure the last stitch by cutting it a few inches from the tail and then pulling the tail through the stitch to form a knot. Thread the tail through a darning needle and then use the yarn to sew the ends together.You can do the same thing with your starting tail, or you can weave this end into the ring and tie it to secure it. Make sure that you do not weave the tail in too tightly or it may affect the fit of your ring.

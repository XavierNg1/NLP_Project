 Talk to the owner and ask them if they know their dog’s heritage. Be sure to approach with a smile on your face and use a friendly tone. They will likely know, or at least, have an idea of their dog’s breed.You might say something like “Hello, that is a really nice looking dog. What breed is it?” or “Hi, what a beautiful dog. Is that a black and tan coonhound?”

, If you adopt or purchase a dog and are unsure of its breed, a veterinarian should be able to tell you. They will examine the dog’s physical characteristics and let you know whether your dog is a black and tan coonhound. If your dog is not a purebred, they may be able to tell you what breeds make up your dog’s heritage.
 If you purchase a dog from a breeder, be sure to inquire about the parentage of your dog. Ask to see the paperwork to show that the American Kennel Club recognizes both parents as black and tan coonhounds. In addition, a breeder may be able to help you identify the heritage of your dog, even if you did not purchase it from them., If you have a photo of the dog, you can scan it in an app on your smartphone to determine its heritage. Applications, like Microsoft’s Fetch!, will tell you what breeds your dog resembles. Although it is not the most accurate means of identifying whether your dog is a black and tan coonhound, it might help you get a better understanding of its heritage., For a more accurate detailing of your dog’s background, you might want to purchase a commercial DNA testing kit. A kit can be ordered online and used in the comfort of your home. Simply swab the inside of your dog’s mouth and mail the sample back to the company for testing. Once the testing is complete, you will get a set of results that tell you whether your dog is a black and tan coonhound.Some kits use a blood sample instead of a cheek swab, which will need to be collected by your veterinarian. While less convenient than swab tests, blood tests decrease the chance of a contaminated sample.

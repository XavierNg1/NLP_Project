 When online daters read about your interests, they are piecing together a puzzle to your personality, discovering a more complete picture of who you are. Mutual interests and hobbies are instant attractors.;
, Humor is the universal language of the soul-a healthy dose of it in your profile can only work wonders. An excellent way to portray your sense of humor is by comparing yourself to a pop-culture icon. Are you as fun-loving as Vincent Chase from "Entourage"? Are you sometimes as ditzy as Paris Hilton? People that can relate to your interests and tastes in entertainment will be drawn to you.
 Try not to water down your profile with trite ramblings of "I love to eat out" and "long walks on the beach are the best"; it's all been said before! Instead, try going into specifics: what is your restaurant of choice? Which beach is your favorite? Give your profile a make-over by reviewing it and replacing what ever sounds tried and generic with specifics. By doing this, you'll colorfully illustrate your many attractive qualities.
 Posing with your beloved pet, your guitar, or your surfboard can give others a bigger picture of who you are; it may even be the deciding factor on whether or not they make the first move. Visuals are an ideal way to quickly catch a person's eye, sparking interest, swaying them to read your profile.
 Always remember that you're never alone in your problems. People have a great tendency to show compassion and sympathy during hard times. Don't be scared to mention your current issues in life-express what you're going through. You may be surprised and find yourself bonding with a very special person who understands where you are in life.

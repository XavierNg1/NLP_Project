 An inexpensive digital camera is a good choice, and will be lightweight and easy to use. Waterproof digital cameras are also available. Be sure the batteries are charged and take along an extra set of batteries for back up.;
, For winter whale-watching trips, a pair of gloves is important. Take a warm sweatshirt during any season, as mornings and evenings can be surprisingly chilly, even on the hottest days.
 Include at least one pair of extra socks if you're whale watching during the winter.
 A hat with a strap is best, as hats have a habit of blowing away with the wind. Brimmed hats are best, as caps will leave your ears exposed to the wind and sun.
 Although water is crucial in hot weather, dehydration can occur even on cool, damp days.
 Take along a sunscreen with a SPF of 30 or more. Apply your sunscreen 30 to 45 minutes before boarding, then reapply regularly. The reflection of the sun on the water will burn your skin very quickly, even on an overcast day.
, If you're prone to seasickness, pack saltine crackers to settle your stomach during the whale-watching cruise, then nibble on a cracker every 15 to 20 minutes.
 Include a few bandages and antiseptic cream. Don't forget your prescription or over-the-counter seasick medication. Take the first dose before you board the boat, then repeat as directed by your doctor, or as suggested on the package. Include prescription medications if your trip is more than a few hours. Toss in a tube of lip gloss to protect your lips from the salt air. A lip gloss or balm with sunscreen is a good choice.
 A fanny pack is handy for keeping smaller items within easy reach.

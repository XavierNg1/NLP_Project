 If you do not have heat-shrink bags and are using manually applied film, use the steps in the guide "Preparing to Shrink-Wrap Using Manually Applied Film" below.









Make sure that the bag is snug over the pallet and items. It does not need to be tight, but it shouldn't be too loose.
Tuck the excess plastic at the bottom of the bag around the corners and edges of the pallet.;
, Starting at the base, use your heat or shrink gun (or hairdryer, though it will be less secure and look less professional) to heat the plastic and cause it to shrink to the pallet and its items.As each heat or shrink gun will have different operating and safety guidelines, be sure to follow their included instructions. A video guide including this step is attached at the bottom of this guide.









After the base is secure, use your heating implement to secure the top of the bag to the items.
Once the base and top are secure, use a slow back-and-forth sweeping motion to seal each side of your pallet.
Each heating implement is different! Be sure to follow your separate instructions when it comes to operation, especially instructions which pertain to safety, how far to hold the shrink gun from the pallet, and how long to apply heat for.
 Being sure to first safely turn off and store your heating implement, you are now ready to inspect your work. A properly shrink-wrapped pallet should feel like a single unit, with no wobbling or instability of its contents. Congratulations! You have successfully shrink-wrapped a pallet.

 The emulsifying agents in dish soap are very effective for breaking up oily messes. Fill up a bucket that you can place nearby, or simply run some water into the sink. Add a generous squirt of a mild liquid dish detergent like Dawn or PalmOlive and stir the mixture together by hand until it forms a bubbly solution.








Try treating large spills and splatters with a sprinkling of flour. The flour will soak up the oil or grease, which can then be scooped up and thrown away.Make sure you clear the area of any electronic appliances or other objects that could be damaged by moisture before you get underway.;
, For most appliances and metal surfaces, it will be okay to use the abrasive side of the sponge. Otherwise, stick with the smooth side to to keep from causing damage, especially if you’re treating materials like wood that scratch easily.








Squeeze the excess solution out of the sponge so you don’t make a mess while cleaning.
For heavy buildup or stains that cover a large area, you can add a little more soap directly to the sponge.
 Use tight, circular motions to lift the grease off of the surface you’re cleaning. Wring out the sponge or washcloth periodically to clear it of dingy water, then rewet it before you continue scrubbing.








Wring out and rewet the sponge as many times as needed until the grease is completely gone.If the stain happens to be on a non-carpeted floor, you can also use the soap solution to mop it like normal., Wet a separate, clean sponge and wipe down the surface again. This will help you make sure you’ve gotten the last of the greasy residue and also remove any remaining soap solution. When you’re finished, pat the newly clean area with an absorbent towel or give it time to air dry.








Soaps can form a slick film or scummy buildup when not properly washed away.
Be sure to dry surfaces that are vulnerable to water damage quickly and thoroughly.

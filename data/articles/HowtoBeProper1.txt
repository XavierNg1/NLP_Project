 Before accepting an invitation or agreeing to tag along somewhere, ask a lot of questions. Find out where the event will take place, what type of event it is (formal or informal) and who will be there. Getting a ton of information upfront will allow you to asses the situation before you get there and make the right decisions so you can fit in.


If the event is formal, for example, a great follow-up question would be regarding the dress code. Ask if a tie is expected or if wearing a suit jacket will suffice.
By finding out the type of people who are expected to make an appearance, you can also make judgements about what's expected. For example, when going to a barbecue with your mom's co-workers, it would be inappropriate to dress like you're going club with friends.;
, What may be acceptable for one group, may be highly improper for another. Research these variables to avoid offending someone.


Consider, for example, slurping is the norm and a sign of culinary enjoyment in Japan but would be viewed as improper at a debutante dance in Georgia, U.S.A.
Another example of this would be understanding the religious observances of certain populations. It would be improper, for instance, to use your left hand while eating amongst certain groups.
 Always watch to see how others are behaving around you. This will offer clues as to what's proper or not. If everyone is greeting with a double kiss on the cheek, follow their lead.


In some cultures, waiting for the eldest to sit first is the proper protocol, while others have no set expectations.

 There are some great ones on teams, or you can create a player. Put all of his stats to 100, while some have to be 99. Save him, and he will be on the Free Agents list. Go to the Free Agents list and transfer him to the team you want him on.;
, You might want to put your player at the top or somewhere around the cleanup position. If he's at the bottom, he won't get up to bat as much!

, While the pitch comes, hold it up and swing (press X). It will be a pop-up, but remember it sometimes always doesn't go out of the park! You can also do this if there is someone on third and you want a sacrifice fly.

 If you're an avid newspaper reader, possibly you'll have a good stock of these somewhere in the house. They are excellent for using in a pinch as fuel. The best method is to turn them into logs. See How to make newspaper logs for more details. These can be burned in a fireplace, barbecue, or cut down steel drum, etc.;
, If you're a keen camper for sport or fun, you might have a ready supply of fuels at hand in your gear. Consider using your fuel and camping stove for heating water and cooking hot meals. Avoid using camping stoves for heating as it'll soon run out and do not use them indoors or in enclosed areas; be sure to use with plenty of ventilation.
 If you have a gas or charcoal barbecue, use it for cooking. Again, it's not a good idea to use it for heating as you should ration the heating ability for cooked food and do not use barbecues indoors or in confined spaces.
 If you have plenty of candles in storage, try this method for turning them into fuel sources:


Cut stripes of corrugated cardboard into a width of about 2cm/ 1.5".
Roll this strip around tightly and squeeze it into a small round can such as those used for fish or small condiments.
Melt the (paraffin wax) candles and pour the melted wax over the rolled up cardboard. Make sure it soaks through and fills any gaps.
Burn when needed. This can be used for cooking, light, and minor heat. It'll last around 1.5 to 2 hours.
 See How to make and use a solar oven for more details.
 If you have cords of wood, use them for making fires in suitable places such as a fireplace, a barbecue, a drum or a fire pit in the backyard, etc.
 If you have some melted wax left over from the previous step, pour it into the hollows of an egg carton. Tear each cube of the carton apart to have ready-to-use fire starters.

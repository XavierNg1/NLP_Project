,, Make them round but imperfectly round and draw them in different kinds of sizes.
 Draw on the first rounded square a star, but make its pointy sides rounded. Erase also some inside lines inside your drawn star to make your artwork cleaner.
 Draw a smaller star inside our previously draw star and then draw five lines meeting in the middle of the stars. You have now a drawn representation of a starfish.
 Copy the shape from the accompanied illustration for the shape of the shell. Donâ€™t forget to erase again some inside lines as instructed on step four.
 Start from the middle of the shell and end the spiral on its right side.
 Create the shell by drawing a fan-like shape but make its edges into small curved lines and then draw two right triangles on both its sides. Draw the shell on the third rounded square and erase again inside lines.
, Start drawing him by drawing first the shape of his body on the fourth rounded square.
 End this step by drawing his tiny circle eyes.
 Use a thick black pen or marker to outline your rounded squares and then thinner pointed pen for your drawing. Clean it up by erasing pencil marks.
 Copy the colors on the illustration or use other colors according to your taste and liking.

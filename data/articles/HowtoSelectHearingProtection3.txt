 Rock concerts at their peak can be in a painful dB range, whereas other concerts, such as jazz or classical music, rarely reach painful volumes. Although earmuffs will also provide adequate hearing protection earplugs will likely be your best option as they are small and concealable. Be sure to carry a pair of disposable earplugs when attending a concert in case volumes reach painful levels.


Rock concerts can reach dB levels of 150 at their peak, which is well beyond a painful register. In comparison, jet plane take-offs are around 120 dB. Look for earplugs with high NRR ratings to reduce your exposure level, ideally to around 80 dB.If you attend or perform in concerts regularly consider purchasing a custom set of pre-molded earplugs that provide protection from the noise levels you are exposed to.
 Machines and tools, whether industrial or home-owned, can risk exposing you to high levels of noise. If you plan on your exposure being consistent, like two hours of jackhammering concrete or using a lawnmower, try using earmuffs. If you plan on your exposure to be inconsistent, like when sawing wood down to parts or drilling intermittently, try using canal caps to easily remove and re-insert your hearing protection in between points of exposure.


Jack hammers produce noise that can be painful (130 dB), while other tools like drills and saws (100 dB) produce noise that is not painful but can still harm your hearing., Try to carry a pair of disposable earplugs if you find yourself in loud public environments, like sports games, trains, or large crowds in a cityâ€™s downtown area. Although you will not need protection consistently, having a pair of earplugs on you will keep you protected when your environment begins to reach noise levels that could harm your hearing.


Crowds and trains produce noise in a range of 80 dB to 90 dB.

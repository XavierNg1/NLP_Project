 You will need the beginning balance, fixed interest rate and the period for which you would like to calculate. Assume you will not be making any additional deposits.
 Replace the variables in the formula FV=P(1+ic)n∗c{\displaystyle FV=P(1+{\frac {i}{c}})^{n*c}} with your actual details. Here is what the variables represent:FV represents the future value of your account

Replace "P" with the amount of your beginning balance.

Replace "r" with the annual interest rate, expressed as a decimal

Replace "c"with the number of times your interest is compounded each year. 

Replace "n" with the the number of years you are measuring growth over. 


, This is used to calculate first the part of the equation in parentheses, then the exponents and finally the multiplication."PEMDAS" is an acronym for "parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition and subtraction" and provides the order that mathematical operations should take place.Assume your account details include a $500 starting balance in an account bearing 2 percent interest, compounded monthly. Assume, also, that you are looking for the future value of your account after five years.

Your completed equation would look as follows: FV=$500(1+0.0212)5∗12{\displaystyle FV=\$500(1+{\frac {0.02}{12}})^{5*12}}

Solving for the multiplication and division within the parentheses first, we get: FV=$500(1+0.00167)24{\displaystyle FV=\$500(1+0.00167)^{24}}

Next, solve the addition within the parentheses to get: FV=$500(1.00167)24{\displaystyle FV=\$500(1.00167)^{24}}

Raise the number within parentheses to the exponent: FV=$500(1.105){\displaystyle FV=\$500(1.105)}

This can be done on a calculator by entering the number in parentheses, pressing the xy{\displaystyle x^{y}} button, then entering the exponent and pressing enter. 



Multiply the two remaining numbers to get your accumulated savings amount: FV=$552.50{\displaystyle FV=\$552.50}

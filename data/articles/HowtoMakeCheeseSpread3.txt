 You'll need:


2 cups grated Cheddar
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup finely chopped pimientos
1/4 cup sweet pickle relish
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt

, Fill the measuring cup as you go to avoid chopping too little or too much. If desired, mash them with a fork. Put them in a medium-sized mixing bowl.
 Add the cheese to the mixing bowl along with the measured relish.
 When the solid ingredients are mixed together well, add the mayonnaise, salt and pepper. Mix everything well with a spoon or rubber spatula.
 Store any leftovers in a sealed container in the refrigerator.

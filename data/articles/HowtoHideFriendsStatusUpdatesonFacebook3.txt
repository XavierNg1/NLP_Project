 Look for the Facebook app on your mobile device. It’s the one with the app icon with the Facebook logo. Tap on it to launch it.
 If you’ve logged out of your previous session, you will need to log in again. Enter your Facebook account and password on the fields provided then tap on “Log in.”


You will be taken to the News Feed.
 Swipe through your News Feed and look for any post from the friend you don’t want to see status updates from.
 Do this by tapping on the downward chevron on the upper right corner of the post box.
 You won’t see any more posts from this particular friend, although you will still be friends.


If you still want to get status updates from your friend, but want to hide one particular post, you don’t need to unfollow him. Instead, tap “I don’t want to see this” from the menu. The specific post will be removed, but you will still get status updates from your friend.

 Food and bacteria can be trapped between teeth. Start by moving the floss up and down a bit between the tooth. That helps loosen and remove the bacteria that lives there. You can even saw back and forth a bit. At this point, you're not at the gum line.Make sure you use about 18 inches (46Â cm) of floss. You want a new bit of floss for each section.
 Go down to the gum line, at the bottom corner of the tooth on one side. Use the floss to cup that tooth, helping you to get the floss down into that corner. Much of the bacteria lives in that corner, so it's important to get down there. Move it back and forth a bit, then move to the other bottom corner of the tooth next to it., Like brushing, flossing needs to be done regularly. Flossing helps remove bacteria that's trapped near the gum line. In turn, that keeps your gums healthier. Aim to floss at least once a day to keep your gums healthy and happy after or before brushing, but never after rinsing with mouthwash.

 Unlike general anesthesia, local anesthesia will only numb a small part of the body. This type of anesthesia is used only for minor procedures. The patient may be awake during the procedure., Regional anesthesia will block the perception of pain from a larger portion of the patient's body. In this case the patient may also receive a sedative. Regional anesthesia can be provided as an alternative to general anesthesia, or sometimes in combination with general anesthesia. There are two types of regional anesthesia.

Peripheral nerve block. In this procedure, anesthetic is injected adjacent to a specific group of nerves.
Epidural or spinal anesthesia. In this procedure, local anesthesia is injected near the spinal cord, which blocks pain from the nerves in the spine. This will block pain in a region of the body such as the chest wall, hips, legs or belly., Conscious sedation is a type of anesthesia involving sedation without being entirely "asleep" or unconscious. This option allows a patient to be somewhat sedated and comfortable while undergoing surgery.Most of the time a nurse, doctor or dentist will administer the sedation using a medication that wears off quickly.
The medication is given through an IV and requires monitoring every three to five minutes.
The patient will likely get oxygen through a mask during the procedure.
Patients often fall asleep but will wake easily and respond to people in the room upon waking.
Some medications used also induce amnesia so the patient may not remember much about the procedure.
The patient may hear voices and drift in and out of sleep, all of which would be normal for conscious sedation. Awareness during conscious sedation does not mean the patient “woke up” during surgery and it is an expected part of this mild type of sedation.

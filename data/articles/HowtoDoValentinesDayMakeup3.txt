 Heart nails don't have to be just a cutesy heart in the middle of your nail, though they can be. It can also be layers of pink and red that just create the middle shape of the heart. If you're layering at home, be sure to let the colors dry between coats., While you may think of pinks and purples for Valentine's Day, any color can be Valentine's with a few hearts and some sparkle. Pick a pale blue with white highlights, for example. Don't be afraid to add some Xs and Os or even spell out "love" across your fingernails., Florals create a romantic flair, and with any number of paint-on designs these days, you have your pick. If you want to create your own, try adding little roses by swirling in red on a white background. Red roses are the perfect complement to Valentine's Day., Polka dots are just cutesy enough to work for Valentine's Day, especially since they are vintage and modern all at the same time. Just be sure to pick contrasting colors when you create polka dots. Light colors on darker colors usually work best., Another option is to go for a dark color, like purple or even black. You can tone it down a bit with some tiny pink hearts. Once those dry, consider coating the top with a sheer pink sparkle to give your nails some shine. You could also swirl in a second color.

 Beagles have short, thick coats that usually don’t get very dirty. Because your Beagle’s coat will probably look clean, you may not think your Beagle needs a bath. However, after a few weeks, body oils and hair can pile up on your Beagle’s skin, causing a bad smell.If your Beagle likes playing in the mud or dirt, you’ll probably need to bathe it more often than once a month.;
, To give your Beagle a good bath, you’ll need a few bathing supplies. You can find these supplies at your local pet store and around your home:Dog-safe shampoo
Cotton balls for the ears
Soft washcloth
Towels
Soft-bristled bathing brush (optional)

, Lukewarm water will be just the right temperature for your Beagle’s bath. If you have an adult Beagle, bathe it in a bathtub. If your Beagle is a puppy, bathe it in a sink because it's so small.Put three to four inches of water in the tub or sink., Beagles have long floppy ears that can trap moisture and become infected.Before the bath, put a few pieces of cotton balls in your Beagle’s ears to keep them from getting wet during the bath.You don’t need to push the cotton balls far down into the ear canals. Place them down just far enough so they don’t fall out.
 Working from front to back, gently bathe your Beagle with the shampoo. Work your fingers or bathing brush through the coat so you get down to the skin. If your Beagle’s coat has a lot of mud or dirt, you may need to shampoo your Beagle several times to get everything out.


Dampen a soft wash cloth with the lukewarm water to clean your Beagle’s face and around its eyes.Rinse the shampoo completely out of your Beagle’s skin and coat. If you’re in the tub, you can use the shower head if your Beagle isn’t afraid of it.
Dry off your Beagle with several towels. Don’t be surprised if your Beagle starts rolling around as soon as you dry it off. It will do this to try to get rid of the shampoo’s scent.

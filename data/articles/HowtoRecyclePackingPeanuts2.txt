 If the company who sent them to you won’t take them back, inquire at businesses that do lots of shipping if they will take your packing peanuts. Moving companies might also agree to take them. UPS stores in many areas will gladly take these peanuts off your hands., Ask your friends and family if they have any use for packing peanuts. If anyone you know is moving or ships a lot of items, they may need these peanuts for their own uses.
 Sites like Craigslist are great for getting rid of things you don’t need. Post an ad saying you have free packing peanuts for whoever will come pick them up. Just be wary of scams; you may wish to meet the person who’d like to get the packing peanuts at a location other than your home.
 Schools and centers are often grateful to receive free items. Ask a local school or community center if they could use packing peanuts for craft projects or even for shipping.

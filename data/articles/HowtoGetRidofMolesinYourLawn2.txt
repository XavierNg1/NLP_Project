 Certain plants can deter moles from occupying your lawn. You can plant plants like daffodils, marigolds, alliums, and fritillarias.Castor bean plants are also a known mole deterrent, but they are also poisonous.
 You can create a mixture using castor oil, which can be found in most health sections of your grocery store, and dish soap. Mix 6 ounces of castor oil with 2 tablespoons of dish soap in one gallon of water to create a concentrate. Apply to the lawn periodically, and be sure to reapply after it rains.
 This can be an effective, hands off solution. Owls are natural predators to moles and you can attract them to your yard by building or buying a nest box. Nest boxes look like large bird house that attaches to a tree high off the ground. Once you assemble the nest box, set it up high in a tree and fill it with straw. It's only a matter of time before an owl is attracted to it., This will require a lot of time waiting around from you. First, pat down the mole trail by walking over it. This will allow you to notice when the mole is actively using the tunnel. Wait nearby for the mole to begin moving around. When you notice the mole, enclose this section of the trail off with two shovels. This will trap the mole. Throw a trashcan or a large bucket over the trapped mole, and then scoop it up and transport it away from your lawn.








Keep in mind that this method is probably the least effective option. Try other methods first.

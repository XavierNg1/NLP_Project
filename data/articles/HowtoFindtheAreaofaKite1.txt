 The formula is A=xy2{\displaystyle A={\frac {xy}{2}}}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the kite, and x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} equal the lengths of the diagonals of the kite., A diagonal is a straight line that runs from one vertex to the vertex on the opposite side.You should either be given the length of the diagonals, or be able to measure them. If you don’t know the length of the diagonals, you cannot use this method.

For example, if a kite has two diagonals measuring 7 inches and 10 inches, your formula will look like this:A=7×102{\displaystyle A={\frac {7\times 10}{2}}}.
 The product becomes the new numerator in the area equation.

For example:A=7×102{\displaystyle A={\frac {7\times 10}{2}}}A=702{\displaystyle A={\frac {70}{2}}}


, This will give you the area of the kite, in square units.

For example:A=702{\displaystyle A={\frac {70}{2}}}A=35{\displaystyle A=35}So, the area of a kite with diagonals measuring 10 inches and 7 inches is 35 square inches.

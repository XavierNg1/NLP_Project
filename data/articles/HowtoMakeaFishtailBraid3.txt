 Start by gathering your hair into a low ponytail, and pulling it either to the left or right of your neck. Tie it off with a clear elastic. Fishtail braid your hair as usual and tie it off. Snip the clear elastic off when you are done.
 Start with a low ponytail. Slip your fingers up through your hair, right between the nape and the elastic. Pull the ponytail down through the hole. Once you have flipped your ponytail, start fishtail braiding as usual.








Try poking a flower or two into the hole of the topsy-turvy for a cute, boho look.
 You can also tie a ribbon over the hair tie in a bow. This can help make your braid more interesting and complete your outfit.
 Keep it in place with a few bobby pins. This will be especially effective if you have really long hair.
 This will give your braid a spark of color, and make it look more interesting.

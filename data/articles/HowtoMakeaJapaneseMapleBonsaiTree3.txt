 Wrap the area with the wet sphagnum moss, then wrap it with plastic and tie in place.


Keep the moss wet. After several weeks, you should see roots through the plastic.
Alternatively, stick the branches into a gritty compost of good quality. Keep this compost medium moist.
Expect roots to form within 2 to 3 weeks if the stock taken is healthy and the conditions are warm and moist.

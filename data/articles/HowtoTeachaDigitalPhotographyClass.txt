 Every student have to bring their own camera with them. By doing that, every student will learn digital photography properly by holding/using their own device which will make it easy for them to learn.;
, Some students might have learnt some of the basics while the others didn't. Don't expect that all the students might be on the same level.


First, teach them how the digital camera works. Always allow them to use their own camera to experiment what you're saying. If they did that, they will never forget how to use it.






Teach the students how does each part of the digital camera works.






Allow them to see you photographing using the digital camera from different areas.
 Allow your students to photograph by themselves. Don't always make them photograph in the class area. Let them go outsides and photograph.


You could also tell them what to photograph. When they finish photographing, take a look at what they did and see whether your teaching was well.






Give them some feedback. Like "That's a good one. Try to take images from different areas the next time".







Be patient. Of course, they might make some mistakes. So be patient and always try to fix their mistakes and help them.
 Explain them the several types of files and file-sizes. It would be great also to explain to them how to transfer images to computers and printers.


Teach them after transferring images to computers how to use photo editing programs. Like Power Points and Photo-shops.






You can tell them after printing the images they took that they can start a hobby and keep all the images they took in a frame on a wall.
 Teach them to share their images online in websites. You can also teach them how to create slideshows from the images they took.

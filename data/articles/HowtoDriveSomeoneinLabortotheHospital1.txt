 Test drive different ways to get to the hospital. This way you'll know which way is the fastest, the best way to go if there's heavy traffic, or alternate ways if there is construction. Be aware that traffic will be different depending on the time of day. You can pick the best route when the woman goes into labor.Keep in mind what events may be going on near the due date. This will help you avoid possible traffic problems, like a parade along your hospital route.;
, If the woman is delivering at a large hospital it's important to know where you can park since many hospitals have several parking lots or garages. Plan to park close to the Labor and Delivery wing or find a convenient way to temporarily park the car so the woman can check in. This way, you can move the car and return to the Labor wing.Don't forget to check any parking fees or time limits before you park. You don't want your car to be towed while you're in the hospital!

, If you have several cars, choose ahead of time which car you'll drive. This way you won't be scrambling at the last minute to find keys, make sure it's full of gas, or load the hospital bag. Ensure that you choose a car that is easy for the laboring woman to get in and out of comfortably.If you plan on using a car service like Uber or Lyft, call ahead to guarantee that the driver will drive the laboring woman to the hospital.
 It's a good idea to have a bag ready with all the things you'll want at the hospital. The woman may already have a bag packed for herself, but you might need things if you plan on staying for the labor. You'll also need to have a car seat installed or ready to install in the car.


If you have an infant car seat, you can install the base and carry the seat into the hospital. However, if you're using a combination car seat, you won't be able to install the seat ahead of time and carry it into the hospital because there is no separate base.

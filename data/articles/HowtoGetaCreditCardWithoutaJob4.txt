 Before you can begin the process of getting a credit card with the help of a cosigner, you will need to find someone who is willing to put their credit on the line for you. A parent or guardian co-signer is the best choice for young adults, but some lender will allow you to use a cosigner who is not related to you.Keep in mind that whoever you use as your co-signer, that person is putting their credit on the line for you. Therefore, if you fail to make your credit card payments or use your card unwisely, that person will be liable for your debts and will probably not be too happy with you.
 Not all lenders will give credit cards to people who need to use a co-signer, so you will have to check the lender’s policies to see if they will even grant a line of credit to an applicant who doesn’t have a job but does have a co-signer.


If you are planning to use your parent or guardian as a co-signer, check with your co-signer’s bank to learn about their policy on co-signer credit cards.
 This application will require information from both you and your co-signer, so you may want to fill it out together. Fill in each part of the application and review it to make sure that all of the information is correct.

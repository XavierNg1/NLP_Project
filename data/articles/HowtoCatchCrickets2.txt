 Use a sharp knife to cut around the circumference of the bottle. Be sure to hold the bottle tightly with one hand so the knife doesn't slip.
 The pour spout should be pointing to the bottom of the bottle, and the cap should be removed. Use duct tape to seal the top edge of the bottle.
 Keep sprinkling until you have a fine layer of sugar at the bottom of the bottle.
 You can use this method either indoors or outdoors. The crickets will crawl through the spout to reach the sugar, and a surprising number of them will be unable to find the hole to get back out.
 Move them to a sealed container to store them for later use.

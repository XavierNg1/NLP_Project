 One of the first things any boy should learn is the difference between "breakdancing" and "Bboying". Bboying is the first term made to describe the dance; it's usually the term used when in the community. The term "breakdancing" was invented by the mainstream media in the 1980s to market the dance. Recently, serious performers have tried to reclaim the name "Bboying" for their performance.









The dance is called B-boying whether the performer is male or female. But when describing a certain individual, there's Bboy (male breaker) and B-girl (female breaker).
All breakers have a nickname, such as Bboy Darkness, Bboy Cloud, etc. At first, this shouldn't be too important, but it is in the long run when you want to gain a better hold of who you are as a dancer and gain recognition in your community.
 Teched in the breakdancing world means varied. It is used to describe the six- or four-step movements a performer is doing on the ground. When a B-boy's movements are heavily "teched," they are very complex and distinct.

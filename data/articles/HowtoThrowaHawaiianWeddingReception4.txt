Use tiki torches to provide festive lighting for an evening wedding reception.
Utilize tiki torches to hold flower arrangements for a daytime wedding. Remove the fuel holder from the tiki torch and fill the torch with fresh or silk flower stems.
Drape chiffon fabric between tiki torches to create aisles or section off areas of the reception. Tie lightweight fabric to tiki torches to create decorative impact in the reception space.
 Because table centerpieces are highly visible, they are an ideal way to carry out a Hawaiian theme.


Decorate tables with pineapples and other tropical fruit. Place tropical fruit into large glass containers for easy and colorful centerpieces.
Create centerpieces from tropical flowers. Use flesh blooms from tropical flowers, such as plumeria and orchids, to create a fragrant and dramatic centerpiece. Add tropical greenery to fill out centerpieces. If fresh blooms are too expensive, consider silk blooms.
Decorate with Hawaiian figurines. Consider figurines of Hawaiian couples kissing or even dashboard hula wigglers for centerpieces with personality.
Create centerpieces from coconut shells or bamboo. For evening luaus, place candles in coconut shells or bamboo stalks to create centerpieces that also illuminate the table.
 Rather than serve macadamia nuts and other small items in traditional bowls and platter, use large sea shells. Smaller shells or coconut shells can be used to hold condiments or silverware.


Wrap grass skirts around the edges of serving tables to create a Hawaiian feel to the reception space.

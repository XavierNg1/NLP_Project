 Place 2 tablespoons (28 g) of butter into a medium saucepan. Mince 2 garlic cloves and add them to the pan. Turn the heat on to medium and let the butter melt.The garlic will also saute as the butter melts.
 Add 2 tablespoons of flour to the saucepan and stir it into the butter garlic mixture. Keep stirring and cooking the mixture for one minute.The mixture will thicken up into a thick paste as you cook it.
 Whisk the mixture constantly while you slowly pour in 3⁄4 cup (180 ml) of chicken, beef, or vegetable broth and 3⁄4 cup (180 ml) of milk. Keep whisking and stirring the sauce until it begins to bubble and thicken.If your sauce becomes lumpy, you can transfer it to a blender or food processor. Blend the sauce until the lumps dissolve.
 Turn the heat off and stir in 2 teaspoons of dried parsley. Add salt and pepper according to your taste. You can serve the sauce over cooked pasta noodles.If you'd like to use fresh herbs, just add 4 teaspoons of freshly chopped parsley.

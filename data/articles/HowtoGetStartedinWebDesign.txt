 For absolute novices, begin by reading up on HTML, CSS and PHP and get a basic understanding of web code & web hosting.;
, A web designer must be armed with an appropriate software arsenal. The best designers will have the following on hand: A code editor (such as Adobe Dreamweaver), an image editor (such as Adobe Photoshop), and an FTP application (such as FileZilla).
 This will provide an idea of placement, dimensions, appearance and aesthetics. Images can then be exported to be included in the website. Be creative, on the web there are very few design limits.
 Either through knowledge of html/css or a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor. Use graphics from the image editor, and also CSS design techniques to get the exact visuals you require. Also place text, image, video and any other content.
 Order a package with a web hosting company, look around for one that best suits you/your customer.
 Using an FTP client login to a web server and upload the website. Once all the kinks have been worked out you can move onto showing the page to the world.
 Post to social networks, advertise with Google Adsense and other PPC (Pay Per Click) advertisers, share it with friends, start some word of mouth, generate clicks through viral marketing.

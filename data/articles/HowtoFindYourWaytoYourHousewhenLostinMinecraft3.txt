 Each Minecraft world has a world spawn point, where new players appear. Compasses only point to this location, which may be helpful if you built your base near where you first appeared. They will not point to your individual spawn point, which is the last bed you rested in.


See the other methods if you are trying to find a house far away from the world spawn point.
 To make a compass, you'll need four iron ingots and one redstone. Using an stone pickaxe or better for iron, or a iron pickaxe or better for redstone, you can obtain the raw ingredients. Redstone ore looks like a stone block with red flecks, and is found deep underground, less than 16 blocks above the bedrock.Iron ore has beige flecks instead, and is usually fairly easy to find.


You can also find redstone by killing witches, trading with villagers, or looting jungle temples.
 Build a furnace and click on it to begin smelting. Add any type of fuel, such as coal or wood, to the lower box, and put the iron ore in the top box. This will smelt the iron ore into iron ingots.
 Click on a crafting table and place a piece of redstone into the center box. Place the four iron ingots above, below, to the left, and to the right of the redstone. A compass should appear in the results box. Drag it to your inventory.


If you want to save materials, you can look at the compass needle, then take the ingredients back into your inventory instead of the compass. The compass needle in the icon will point toward the spawn point, just as it does when equipped. It can be tedious trying to use a compass this way on a long trip, however.
 Hold the compass, and you should see a larger image of the compass appear in your character's hand. The compass needle will point toward the world spawn point, and will change direction as you do. Walk in the direction the compass is pointing until you find an area you recognize.

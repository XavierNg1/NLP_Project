 Oftentimes, jerks and bullies treat other people badly because they have low self-esteem or because they are being treated badly by others also. While this doesn't excuse their actions, it may help you feel better to know that the bullies you're dealing with probably aren't as confident as they want you to think., You shouldn't live your life in fear of running into a jerk at school, but you'll be better off if you try to avoid interactions with negative people as much as possible. Just walk the other way when they come near.Negative people can have a seriously bad effect on your overall well-being. Studies have shown that negativity around you can reduce your productivity, which is why it's so important to steer clear of these kinds of people. Conversely, spending time with positive people will make you feel energized and optimistic., It may be tempting to pick on people who are more vulnerable than you in order to become more popular or gain a reputation for being tough, but this is a bad idea! Rise above bullying by being nice to other people, even if they are different than you. This will help you make genuine friends and it will make you feel good about yourself, so it won't matter what the jerks have to say about you.


Even if you have a tight group of friends, be open and inviting to others as well. Making people feel like they don't belong or aren't welcome in your group of friends can be just as mean as insulting them. (If you have dealt with cliques at your school, then you probably know how it feels to be excluded.)

, If you must interact with the jerks at your school, be polite. There is no reason to sink to their level, and insulting them will likely only make you more of a target for them. Show these jerks that you have no interest in letting their negative attitudes have any effect on your behavior.

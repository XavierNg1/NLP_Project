, Decide what kinds of party food you will be serving. Are you planning a simple party with snacks and dips? Will you be serving a full dinner meal with appetizers and dessert? Make note of any recipes you'll need when it comes time to cook. Keep in mind your guests requirements. Not everyone loves junk food so make sure to have some healthy food on offer as well. If you have a friend that you know is highly allergic to a specific food, it is a good idea to not serve this food or let everybody know to stay away from that person while consuming that food.
 If you plan on using canned foods as part of your recipes, purchase them ahead of time and store them somewhere safe. Other non-perishable foods include frozen food, pasta, dry beans, and bottled beverages. By purchasing non-perishables ahead of time, you cut down the size of your shopping list significantly, allowing you to focus only on purchasing perishables before the party.
 There are plenty of food recipes that can be prepared days or even weeks before the date of an event as long as you freeze and store the food properly. This will take a huge load off your shoulders in the days preceding the actual event.
 This is less important if you're only hosting a party for a handful of people, but can save you a lot of time and money if you're hosting a large party. Wholesale distributors allow you to purchase items in bulk quantities at a reduced price.

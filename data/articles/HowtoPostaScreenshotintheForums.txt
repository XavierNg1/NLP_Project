 You can take screenshots using software that's already on your computer, or you can download a program (some are free, some aren't). Programs are usually good in that they make it easier to point to or highlight certain parts of the screenshot. For example Grabilla allow you to take a screenshot, upload it with single click and automatically get a code for forum. For now, though, let's start with taking screenshots without a program.


In Windows, hold down the Alt key and then press the Print Screen key. Open Microsoft Paint (Start > All Programs > Accessories > Paint). Press and hold "Ctrl" and tap V. This will put your screenshot in MS Paint. Save it.
On a Mac, hold down the COMMAND and the SHIFT key and 4. If you press them all at the same time, you'll get a "crosshairs" so you can select just a section of the screen you want a screenshot for. The resulting file will be placed on your desktop.;
,, If you are given several codes, choose actual image URL/blog code.

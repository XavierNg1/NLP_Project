 If he made you feel bad about yourself in any way, then you are way better off without him in your life. Don't blame yourself for what happened. Remember that you deserve people who will value you and treat you with respect. Rejection hurts, but you will be much happier if you stick to people who actually want to be with you.
 They have probably been in the same boat, likely too many times to count. It might be a cliché, but rent a few chick flicks, buy a gallon of ice cream or a bottle of wine, and hole up with your girlfriends in front of the TV for the night. Laugh at yourselves, yell at the screen that real guys never act like that, talk about what you want from the next guy that comes into your life—just enjoy yourself. Good friends will remind you what a fun, gorgeous person you are, you won't feel as alone.
 If there's a new girl on the scene, remember it's not her fault that he chose her. This doesn't make her any better than you. Don't react if she or he rubs their new relationship in your face. Be classy in this and everyone (including your ex) will respect you for it.
 Enjoy the single life for a while. Rebounds can be nice, but in the end they just remind you of what you lost. Instead have fun with all the things you love that got neglected while you were focused on your love life.

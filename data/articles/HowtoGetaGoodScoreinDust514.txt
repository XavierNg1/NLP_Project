 Depending on how you set up your character initially, you may start with different skills. What you want to train into for the future will ultimately be up to you, but just starting out you should train the basics first. Shield management, armor upgrades, weapon upgrades all to level V.;
, You will start off with some basic "militia" fits that will always be free to use and will never run out. You can use these to get examples for fits and start to learn how you like to play.
 The two main flavors of battle are Skirmish and Ambush. Ambush maps involve working with a team of "blues" to destroy the enemy team of "reds" who will be trying to destroy you at the same time. The first team to lose all their clones loses. If the time runs out, the team with the most clones wins. Skirmish maps involve two teams fighting for control of certain objectives that help destroy the enemy Mobile Command Center(MCC). The more objectives you control, the faster the enemy MCC will be damaged. The first team to destroy the enemy MCC wins the match. At the end of the match, based on your performance and the amount of time you were in battle, you will receive both money(ISK) and Skill points(SP) which you can use to buy new dropsuits, fittings, skills, and as you progress, vehicles, equipment and other useful things.
 Going solo will get you killed by enemy groups. Getting killed hurts your score and your wallet so its best to avoid death if possible.
 Over time you will decide what you like to do in Dust and you should train your skills towards that specialty. Your scores will start to go up and you will have more fun too in this truly massive online universe!

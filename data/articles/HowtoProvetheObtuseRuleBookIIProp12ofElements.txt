Triangle ABC is an obtuse angled triangle having the obtuse angle at C. Squares are constructed on each of the three sides AB, BC and AC. Further, BC is extended and from A, a perpendicular is dropped on the extended portion of BC which meets it at D.;
,
We need to prove that the square constructed on the side which subtends the obtuse angle (the side AB) is larger than the other two squares taken together by twice the rectangle contained by either of the other two sides (say BC) and its extension (CD, in this case). This can be done if we prove that the area of the square constructed on side AB equals the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides plus twice the area of the rectangle which can be formed by BC and CD.
Mathematically, we need to prove that
AB2 = BC2 + AC2 + 2.BC.CD

,,,,, Thus we have proved what we needed to.

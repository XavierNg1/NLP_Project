 It is a good idea to get insurance for major purchases like expensive flights, cruises, and tour packages. If for some reason you have to cancel, you do not want to be out the hundreds or even thousands of dollars that you paid for these things. Getting insurance for these major expenses may also provide some much-needed peace of mind.If you are traveling with expensive or invaluable items, you may also want to get some kind of coverage.
 Different credit cards have a number of different insurance-related perks. For instance, some credit cards will provide auto insurance for a rental car. Others provide travel protection and cover the expenses of lost luggage. Before you make your travel arrangements, contact your credit card provider and determine what perks, if any, your card offers.Some credit cards may even provide coverage if you have to cancel a flight.
Ask questions like “Will my luggage be protected against loss or damage?” and “If I get into a car accident, how much will you cover?”

, Some of your existing insurance policies may cover any expenses that pop up during your trip. For instance, your homeowners or renters insurance may cover loss or damage to your luggage. If you have car insurance, you are likely covered if you rent a car. Check your existing policies or talk with your insurance agent to see what things are covered.If you already have a life insurance, you should not need an accidental death policy.
With lost luggage, the airline will also cover your loss up to a certain point.
If your existing coverage does not protect your luggage, only take possessions that you can live with losing. If you have to travel with valuables and you are not covered, you should get some insurance.
Ask your insurance agent questions like “Does my auto insurance cover rental cars overseas?” and “Does my renter's insurance cover my luggage?”

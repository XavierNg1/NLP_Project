 Collect 4 tsp (20 ml) of canning juice from a can of shucked oysters. Pour this liquid into a small bowl.


You will not need to use the oysters for this recipe. You can discard them or use them for another recipe. Transfer the oysters to a plastic or glass container with an airtight lid and refrigerate for up to one or two weeks.;
, Pour 8 tsp (40 ml) of soy sauce into the bowl of oyster juices. Use a whisk to thoroughly mix the liquids together.


You could use light or dark soy sauce, or a combination of the two.
Alternatively, if you do not have any soy sauce, you could use teriyaki.
 Sprinkle 1 tsp (5 ml) of sugar into the liquid and whisk rapidly until the sugar is fully dissolved.
 Taste the oyster sauce. If necessary, add another 1 tsp (5 ml) of oyster juice and/or another 1 tsp (5 ml) of sugar. Mix well.


You can add more soy sauce, as well, but do so carefully to avoid making the mixture too salty. Neither the saltiness of the soy sauce nor the sweetness of the sugar should be too overpowering.
 The oyster sauce can be used immediately, but if you want to save it for another time, pour it into an airtight plastic or glass container and refrigerate for up to one week.

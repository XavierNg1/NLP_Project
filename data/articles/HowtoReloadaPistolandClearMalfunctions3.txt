 Often a type-1 malfunction is a misfeed, in which a round was not loaded into the chamber (e.g. you didn't rack the slide after you loaded a magazine, or the magazine wasn't seated enough to load a round).
 This is a relatively dangerous malfunction where there is not enough force to propel the projectile out of the barrel. In semi-automatic pistols, a squib is often easily noticeable, as the slide will not cycle and a new round will not be chambered. If a squib load happens, remove the magazine and clear the obstruction immediately.
 Only attempt to immediately clear the malfunction during a live-fire, real confrontation. This is due to the risk of the round eventually firing. If you experience a hang fire, keep the firearm pointed down range for at least 10 seconds before attempting to clear.
 The quickest way to do this is through immediate action. With a semi-automatic pistol, pull the slide back, ejecting the last round. Observe the ejection and the round. If the lead is still on the bullet, you know that the round didn't fire. If the lead is gone, it may indicate a weapon malfunction. Observe the chamber. Check for double feeds, or things that don't belong. Release the slide, seating the next round. Deactivate the safety and attempt to fire the weapon. If it still fails to fire, remove the magazine and eject the current round, and turn the weapon over to a gun expert for repair.

Point at the target, pull the trigger, feel the "click".
With the heel of your palm hit the bottom of your magazine (with some fervor; this is the "tap").
Then twist your gun 90-degrees to the right (so the ejection port is down) and...
Rack the gun by pulling the slide straight back and letting go; do not ride the slide forward, let it slam (this the "flip" and "rack" part of the drill). This will drop a possibly dud round out of the chamber and load a new round into the chamber.

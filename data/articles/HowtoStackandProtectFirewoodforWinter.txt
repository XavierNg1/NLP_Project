 Experts recommend splitting wood into triangular pieces since it often stacks better that way. Triangular cuts prevent otherwise round pieces from rolling off a pile and injuring someone. A length of about 1 to 1.5 feet (0.3 to 0.5 m) is recommended.;
, Again, without proper support, pieces can fall off the woodpile and injure those who are accessing it. Use sound, heavy items to support each end of a woodpile.


Some who prefer a natural approach like to use trees to support the ends of a woodpile. In some cases, this might be fine, but watch out for the risks of changing or stunting a tree's growth over time.
Some helpful steel frame designs are on the market for helping to store cord wood safely and securely.
 Some people might not want to leave a woodpile exposed to the elements, but on the other hand, sunlight helps to cure wood, making it drier for eventual use. A good common ground is to cover the woodpile but expose it to sunlight from the sides.
 Those who build wood storage racks higher than ground level can have much better results. That's because wood that is in contact with the ground can suffer from fungal growth, mold or rotting. That's not to mention the variety of animals who might seek to make their homes there.
 One additional safety risk with any woodpile is the risk of fire. When wood piles are too close to a building, they can escalate a blaze if they catch fire. It's best to keep the woodpile about 20 feet (6.1 m) away from homes and buildings.

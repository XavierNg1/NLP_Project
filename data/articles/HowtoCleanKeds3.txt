 It is a common mistake to try to clean white Keds using bleach, but bleach can actually cause canvas to turn yellow. These stains may be permanent, but there are a few techniques you can try before giving up.


Mix half a cup of cream of tartar with a quart of hot water. Soak your Keds in this overnight.
You can also try making a paste out of baking soda and water. Apply this paste to the canvas, and leave it overnight. Clean as usual the next day.
Applying hydrogen peroxide directly to the stains may also help. If it doesnâ€™t work at first, try a few more applications., Salt stains may appear on your shoes during winter if the streets and sidewalks are salted. To remove salt stains, mix one part vinegar with two parts water. Using a paper towel or white cloth, blot the stain with the mixture. Take another clean cloth dampened with just water, and dab the vinegar away. Let them dry completely before wearing., Mold and mildew can form if your Keds became wet and dried improperly. To get rid of mold and mildew, mix equal parts water and rubbing alcohol. Use a rag or cotton towel to apply this solution to the mildew and gently scrub it away. Rinse the shoes afterwards., Mix a mild laundry detergent with about one tablespoon of bleach.

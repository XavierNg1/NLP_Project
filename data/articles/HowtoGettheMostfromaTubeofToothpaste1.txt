 Start using a tube by pressing the far end, and working your way toward the cap. Flatten the tube as you go, to extract every last bit of toothpaste.;
, A roller is an inexpensive metal or plastic device that slips onto the end of the tube to assist with rolling. Also called a “winder,” “key,” or “wringer,” this will squeeze out the last little bit of paste.


If you like gadgets, a wall-mounted dispenser delivers a small blob of paste with the touch of a button.
Rollers and dispensers are very helpful if you suffer from arthritis of the hands.
 If you're at the very end of a tube and can't get any more out, try cutting it open with a pair of scissors. You'll usually get one or two additional uses out of a tube this way.
 Moistening your toothbrush first lets you get the same cleaning effects with less paste. If you put toothpaste on a dry brush, running water may wash the paste off into the sink. It might also help the toothpaste taste a little better.
 That thick, caterpillar-sized serving you see in toothpaste ads is three or four times the amount you really need to brush effectively. Apply a small amount to the brush, about the size of a pea. If it foams up and feels like it's doing its job, that's probably enough paste.


Don't skimp too much. Any toothpaste is cheaper than getting a cavity filled, so don't skimp too much on paste. Most dentists recommend using a pea-sized amount.

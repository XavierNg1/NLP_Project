 This can be very dangerous, so think twice before using this step. The marbles will need to be on a hard wood floor, otherwise they are unlikely to make the intruder slip. Try to leave about two dozen marbles.


Remember to think about the way the door opens. If the door is pushed up and you leave the marbles too close to the door, the intruder will just push all the marbles out of the way.
 Fill a medium sized bucket with cold water. Now leave the door slightly ajar. Balance the bucket on top of the door using the door itself as the base for the bucket. It should be a delicate balance, but that’s what you want. When the intruder goes to push the door open, the water will fall right on their head.
 This is an incredibly annoying and effective booby trap. All you’ll need is string, nails, and flypaper from a home improvement store. Cut five feet of string and tie one end of the string to the doorknob. Now put two nails in the ceiling. Put the first one approximately a foot from the door and the other approximately five feet away. After you've done that, loop your string through the first nail and start attaching flypaper to the rest of the spring. Don’t wrap the flypaper around the string; just stick it on there so that there is plenty of sticky surface area still available. Loosely loop the end of the string around the final nail. When the door opens, the string will be pulled off of this last nail, the flypaper will swing down from the first nail, and stick to the person who opened the door.

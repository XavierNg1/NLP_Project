 This might be lined notepad paper, printer paper, scrap paper, and so forth.;
, How large or small do you want it? A journal made from 10 to 50 pages is usually a good size for all sorts of things.
 This must be different from the inner pages, and stronger too. A piece of thin card or thick paper is ideal. It can be plain, as you can color or cover it if wished.
 Align them so that they fit together nicely. Then find the center of the pages, using a ruler to help you, if needed. This will be the fold line that forms the middle of the journal. Fold the pages down this line.


If using many pages, you'll need to do this in smaller stacks until all of the pages are folded, then bring them all together.
 The crease line must be firmly bent in place.
 Staple as closely as you can next to the fold line. Keep the staples in line, as neatly as possible.


The more staples added, the more stable the journal will be. However, a minimum would be about four staples in evenly spaced places along the spine of the journal.
 You might like to write the purpose of the journal on the cover or on the first inside page.
 It's all ready now.

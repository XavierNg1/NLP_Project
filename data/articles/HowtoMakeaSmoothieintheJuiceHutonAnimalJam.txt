 Something will pop up.
 There are four kinds of drinks to choose from. Then, something else will show., For example, if you aren't making a banana-flavored smoothie, avoid catching bananas. Don't catch that in your cup, or your juice will go down. Now, once you have caught a few strawberries or the other flavors, the color in your cup will go up (if you got strawberry it would be a red circle)., Once you have filled your cup up with the correct fruit, the machine will tell you that you've won. After the message flashes a bit, a drink will pop up by your animal. You can now drink it.

 You can create healthier versions of recipes that call for fats like butter by using walnuts instead. Walnuts are high in fat content, but it’s much healthier fat than what you find in butter, so you don’t have to feel so guilty about those recipes!


For example, replacing the butter in pesto with walnuts gives you a creamy, delicious texture and taste with less calories. Blend basil, olive oil, finely chopped walnuts, and garlic cloves in a food processor. Add a bit of Parmesan cheese and blend for five to 10 seconds more.You can also use walnuts to make walnut butter. Walnuts are generally better for you than peanuts (and people are often allergic to peanuts but not walnuts), so this is a great substitution. Blend equal amounts roasted walnuts and raw walnuts in the food processor for about 30 seconds. Add honey and a pinch of salt and blend until smooth., A lot of recipes call for breadcrumbs, and walnuts that have been crushed very finely are a great substitute. Walnuts give you all of the flavor but less of the fat that breadcrumbs do.


For example, you can make a great walnut coating for fish. Simply crush walnuts very finely and press onto the top of your fish filets before you roast them. You can spice up the coating by adding garlic, salt, and pepper., This one sounds a little crazy, but using walnuts alongside other ingredients like cauliflower can give you the taste and texture of meat while keeping your dish vegetarian. This type of substitution is great if you’re vegetarian or vegan and miss certain flavors or if you’re just trying to save some money at the grocery store.To make a vegetarian meat substitute with walnuts, cook a finely chopped mix of cauliflower, mushrooms, carrots, yellow onion, and garlic in a skillet over medium high heat for about 5 minutes. Add a finely chopped meal of walnuts and sundried tomatoes to the veggies on the stove and cook for 1 minute. 2 cups (16 oz) of this mix will replace 1 pound of meat.

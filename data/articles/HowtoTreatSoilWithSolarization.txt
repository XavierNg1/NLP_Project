 It's best done midsummer or late summer, to ensure that you get the most sunny weeks and the heat.;
, Perhaps an area of the garden after a crop has been finished.


Since this takes an area of the garden out of production, consider rotating this method around the garden.
 Use a garden spade and work the soil until it has a fine texture. Break up any clods.
 Make sure it is as smooth as you can get it.
 Water so that the soil becomes moist down as far as possible but don't saturate it.
 It must touch the soil completely (hence the reason for smoothing it well). Hold the plastic down with soil. Rocks can also be used. Just be sure it's attached firmly.
 If it's some sun and some rain or overcast weather, leave it longer, about 6 to 8 weeks.Temperatures under the plastic on a hot day will be hot enough to kill any nematodes, bacteria, cutworm and less resilient weed seed, about 50ºC to 60ºC.
 Use a thermometer to check the soil temperatures. After several weeks in a row of the same high temperature being recorded, the plastic sheet can be removed and the soil will be sterilized.
 Don't disturb the soil other than to plant in. Do not dig in manure or compost. If fertilizer is needed, simply leave the manure on the surface and let the rainwater it in.

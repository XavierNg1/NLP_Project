 If you have a very new or high-end vehicle the key might not be replaced by anyone but the manufacturer or distributor. In this case, you may be able to get a discount through your warranty. Bring all your car’s information, a valid photo ID, and any other sets of keys you may have to the dealership. Hope for the best!

, Depending on the sophistication of your car key you may be able to have a new electronic key programmed by a locksmith. Many new car keys have a microchip in them to prevent duplication. However, if you have a key with a transponder in it you can probably get a new one at a locksmith for $50.00 - $120.00 depending on your car and your area.. Manufacturers started using transponders in the 1990’s – they are chips in the head of the key that communicate with the car. If the wrong key is in the ignition, the car will not start. Transponder keys are available at locksmiths,, Search for ‘aftermarket electronic car keys’ on the Internet and you’ll find plenty of options for replacement electronic car keys. Oftentimes you’ll be able to get a new car key for 75 % less than what the dealer would charge you. But you still need to get it cut and programmed so be sure to check prices for that in your area before you purchase anything.
 This will cost you upwards of $200. However, if you just want a key that you know will work and you want to get it quickly and easily this is not a bad option. Visit your local dealer – if it’s a Honda, go to a Honda dealership, if it's a Ford go to a Ford dealership, etc.
 Sometimes you can program them to your specific car without a special technician. The instructions are usually included with the new key, but your owner’s manual will be very helpful in this situation. Depending on the car, reprogramming usually involves opening and closing the doors and/or turning lights and other electronics on and off. You press a series of buttons like a code, basically.

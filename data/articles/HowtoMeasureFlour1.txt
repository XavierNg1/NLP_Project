 This is the best way to ensure accuracy when you're measuring out flour by volume. Itâ€™s more difficult to use the proper technique with an oversized measuring cup, since you can't complete the final step of leveling off the top. So, for example, if your recipe calls for 1 1/2 cups of flour, use both a one-cup dry measuring cup and a half-cup dry measuring cup. If your recipe calls for 2/3 cup of flour, measure out two 1/3 cups instead of using a larger cup.;
, Flour tends to come tightly packed in paper bags. If you don't fluff it up before measuring it, you'll end up measuring out more flour than you actually need for your recipe. Dig your spoon into the container the flour is in and fluff it up a little.You might want to consider storing your flour in a metal, plastic or glass container with a lid instead of keeping it in the bag it came in. That way your flour won't be as tightly packed, and it will be easier to reach in and fluff it up when you need to use some.
 Use a spoon to scoop flour into the cup until the cup is slightly overfull. Do not pack the flour into the cup; just lightly scoop it in until the cup is full and a small peak has formed in the center.
 Use a straight edge, such as the back of a knife, to level off the top by running it against the rim of the cup. Do this over the container so the excess flour drops back in. You're now ready to use the flour in your recipe. If it calls for additional cups, measure them the same way.

 This gives the evaporator time to dry off excess moisture (key for mildew/mold growth) using the hot air from the engine. No moisture means no mold, which means no smell!, With the AC off, keep the fans blasting to make sure a lot of air hits the evaporator and removes any mildew, moisture, or mold spores from taking root.


Note -- this is a way to prevent further growth. It will likely not help remove the actual smell if it is already there.
 This can prevent all mold from ever getting a foothold. Remember that the AC, not the fan, creates the moisture that spawns mold. The fan will just heat it up from the hot car motor (hopefully killing it) and then remove it from the AC evaporator., Warm, wet environments are paradise for mold and mildew. Furthermore, the more you use your AC, the more likely it is to grow dirty. Keep on top of the issue with regular cleanings, as noted above.

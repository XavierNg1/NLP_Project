 If you're growing an entire field of switchgrass, the main pest you'll need to worry about is grasshoppers, which are a threat to seedlings when switchgrass is planted at an agricultural scale. If grasshoppers become a concern, there are two main ways you can deal with the problem:Dust the switchgrass with flour. Use use all-purpose flour and dust the grass and the insects. After two days, rinse it off.Treat with chemical pesticides. While strong pesticides are best avoided, especially if you're using switchgrass to feed livestock or house native species, you may have to turn to this option as a last resort.
 If you're growing grass to harvest for hay or biofuel, just after flowering is the best time to do it, although you can wait to harvest just after the first frost of the year if you'd like. If you harvest early in the year, you may be able to do a second harvest before winter., Cattle love to eat switchgrass, so it's a great sustainable food source. Make sure the switchgrass has grow at least a foot high before you graze it, so the plant's roots don't get damaged.


Stop grazing the area when the grass is six inches off the ground.
Let it rest for 30 to 60 days before grazing again.
 Burning is a common technique used for different types of native grasses, since it stimulates new healthy growth. It also reduces mulch, which is necessary if you planted the grass to provide shelter for birds and animals that need space among the stalks to thrive.There may be restrictions as to when and how you can burn in your area, so be sure to follow local regulations.

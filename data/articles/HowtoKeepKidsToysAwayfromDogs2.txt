 You will need to discipline your dog if it takes your kids’ toys. When you discipline your dog is important, though—do so only if you actually see your dog take the toy. If you discipline your dog after the fact, your dog will not understand why it’s in trouble. Instead, your dog will become fearful of you or maybe even aggressive towards you.It may be challenging to catch your dog in the act., The ‘drop it’ command teaches a dog to drop whatever it has in its mouth. If you see your dog putting one of your kids’ toys in its mouth, tell your dog to drop it. Reward your dog with a treat when it drops the toy. By rewarding your dog, you are making a positive association with dropping the toy.


When your dog drops the toy, you can also reward your dog with one of its own toys. This will help your dog learn the difference between its toys and your kids’ toys.
If you’re lucky enough to see your dog walking towards one of your kids’ toys, you can command your dog to leave the toy where it is. The ‘leave it’ command teaches a dog not to put something inappropriate in its mouth.
 If your dog routinely gets into your kids’ toys, you may be so upset with this behavior that you shout at your dog. However, shouting at your dog will not stop the behavior (even if you catch your dog in the act). Rather, it will make your dog fearful or wary of you.


Also, do not chase your dog if it has one of your kids’ toys in its mouth. Chasing will feel like a game to your dog, so it will actually enjoy the chase.

 Be sure to melt the butter! Add all these ingredients into a big bowl and use a rubber spatula to make your crust.;
, Core them, then cut the skin with a butcher knife, and dice them into small, bite-size pieces.
 Heat a pan on medium-low, and melt 2 tablespoons of butter in the pan. When the butter is melted add all the apples. Let them sit for around 5 minutes, or until they're soft enough to poke a fork through with ease. Put in the brown sugar, stir, and let them sit until the juices thicken (Around 3 minutes). Remove all heat and add the cinnamon.
 Use any size cutter to your preference, but I usually use a cutter the size of my hands put together as a circle.
 Depending on the size of your pie, add apples to the middle. After they're added, fold over the dough. Seal the sides with a fork, and get a toothpick and add three, rice-size vent holes.
 Combine the sugar, egg, and water in a bowl, and glaze each pie.
 Bake each pie at 375 degrees for 15 minutes, or until golden brown.

 Injuries from accidents, violence, or animal bites, as well as dirty wounds with foreign objects, require quick first aid and professional medical attention. This is partly because coagulation is insufficient to prevent bleeding from hemorrhaging and other major injuries, even if you have healthy blood.If you are able to see muscle or fat tissue or unable to press the edges of the wound together using gentle pressure, get to a hospital.
Other reasons a wound should be considered serious include close proximity to a joint or genitalia, a jagged pattern of broken skin, a continuous or pulsing flow of blood, or impalement by something visibly unclean.
Reduce bleeding for transport of an injured person by applying pressure bandages and, if necessary, a tourniquet.;
, Kaolin is a mineral that has been used to help reduce blood loss following major injuries, including those sustained in combat. Use dressing that is impregnated with kaolin to apply a pressure bandage to the wound. The pressure counteracts the blood pressure that would otherwise push blood out of the body, while the kaolin will prompt the coagulation process to begin.Get kaolin-treated dressings for your vehicleâ€™s first aid kit, or to carry in first aid kits while spending time in remote areas. They can be found a specialty supplies stores and online.
 Another first aid item used to treat injuries that involve major hemorrhaging are small mesh bags that contain the mineral zeolite. When activated, these bags not only fill a large wound and apply even pressure throughout, the zeolite prompts the blood in the area to begin coagulating and can even speed up the process.Mesh pouches filled with zeolite can be purchased from specialty first aid retailers. They will be easier to find online than in stores.
These items are designed to help treat large wounds, and are designed to stabilize wound victims for transport to a medical facility.
QuikClot is a zeolite containing product that stops bleeding fast.

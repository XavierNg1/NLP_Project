 This will help you maintain control of the car.
 Try to turn the car as gently and accurately as possible while keeping your foot lightly on the accelerator.
 More throttle will set you wider, less will set you tighter. If the car seems to turn too much, the back-end is probably skidding. You will need to ease off the power almost completely, slide the wheel just a bit through your hands, and then apply the throttle as hard as possible for one moment.
 When exiting a fast curve, you can re-apply the throttle very quickly, as the wheels would never spin at such speeds.

 When you’re creating a ponytail and accent braid combination, the style will look best if your hair has some texture. Use a curling iron, hot rollers, or your favorite method for curling your hair to add waves and texture before you style it.








Don’t worry about creating perfect curls. It’s okay if they’re a little messy as long as they add texture.
If your hair is naturally curly or wavy, you don’t need to add any texture.
If you prefer, you can leave your hair straight for a simpler look.
 After you’ve curled your hair, decide which side you want to part your hair. Next, use a comb to carefully part your hair on the chosen side, making sure that it looks as neat as possible.
 Once you’ve parted your hair, take a small section of hair from the side that you’ve parted it on. Aim for a section that’s approximately 1-inch (2.5-cm) wide, and create a simple three-strand braid with it. Secure the end of the braid with an elastic.








You can create a larger braid if you prefer. If you have thick, textured hair, a larger section can actually look best.
 After you’ve braided the section of hair, gather up all of your hair, including the braid, and pull it back into a ponytail. Use a hair elastic or clip to secure the ponytail, and spray your hair with a flexible hold hairspray to keep it in place all day.








Once your hair is pulled back into the ponytail, you can remove the elastic from the end of the braid if you’d like.

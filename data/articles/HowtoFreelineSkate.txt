A park or an empty car park will be the best for beginners due to the rails and walls present.;
,


Each freeline skate is labelled with L and R, which means there are specific skates for your left and right feet, just like shoes.
 Put your right foot on the freeline skate labelled with R with the tip of the shoe facing downward; then put the other on the freeline skate labelled with L with your foot at neutral position.
 Now you should be moving due to the momentum. Just put your feet down if you become unbalanced. Don't give up and keep the momentum going.
 When you are moving, move one of your feet in a horizontal S motion; this should allow you to skate further a little bit. Then try the other way round. It can be difficult for both legs to move in the carving motion simultaneously initially, so practice one leg first, then move on to both. If you get it right off the bat, just go with it.
 The wheels on each skate are facing different directions. Every time you practice, try to push your skates towards the direction the wheels are facing.
 Lift your foot away from the deck when you want to stop. If there is a lot of momentum, then run as you jump off the deck.
 Combine the above steps in practice, and you'll be freeline skating like a professional in no time.

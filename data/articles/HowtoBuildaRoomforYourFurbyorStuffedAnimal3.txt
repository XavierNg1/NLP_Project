 Check if you have enough space for your Furby. The best type of drawer would be the one in your bedside table or any drawer in your bedroom.
 If you're allowed to, stick the fabric to the floor of your drawer with hot glue. Velvet or silk would work best as the lining fabric.
 Make a bed by making a small pillow, the size of your Furby's head, and placing some leftover fabric on top of a small bed. Then place the pillow on top. If you want to make a blanket too, make it the size of your Furby's body.
 If you have little doll house furniture, you might want to use it. If you have a torch, add it in one corner and turn it on while your Furby's inside. Do this just before bedtime, and turn it off when your Furby goes to sleep.
 Wipe only its fur with a barely dampened cloth, then brush your furby's fur and hair. Now let your Furby enjoy its new house.

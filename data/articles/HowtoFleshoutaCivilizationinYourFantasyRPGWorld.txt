, Your civilization needs to be shaped around something. This could be anything from Magic, Technology, or Religion, to Climate, Superstition, or Emotion.
 What is your civilization mainly made up of? Is it all Humans? All nonhuman? A mix of both? It could be all animal or all alien or all plants!

, You need to decide where your civilization is located and come up with a main climate. For example, if your civilization is based in Antarctica, the climate would be snowy and cold. As opposed to if your civilization was located in the Kalahari Desert where the climate would be hot and dry. Also decide where oceans, if any, would be. On all sides like an island? on one side? On three sides? You get the point.
 How common are the wild animals and natural resources available or located? What kind of animals live in the area? Are they hunted? What kind of resources are available? What of them are used?

, Do you want a total anarchy or will there be strict order? If you decide to make it a king and queen ruled civilization, you may want to write a small textbook of previous rulers. Also, make laws. You can write them down into a rulebook or book of law.

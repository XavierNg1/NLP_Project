 Furniture made with materials that aren't sturdy, or furniture that has been very heavily used and is full of scratches, should be priced cheap so you can move it off the lawn. At these prices, you may be able to sell off your old furniture to students looking to furnish a dorm cheaply., A solid wood dresser, table, cabinet, or bookshelf might be one of the higher-priced items in your yard. A good rule of thumb for these items is to charge 1/3 the original price. If you paid $300 for a table you've hardly used, go ahead and charge $100 for it. You can always drop the price if you need to.
 If you've got something truly special, like a Tiffany lamp or a Victorian chaise, price it high. The right buyer will be willing to pay what it's worth.


If you don't know the item's value for sure, do some research first or get it appraised. You don't want to undersell your most valuable possessions.
Display high value items close to the house, in a special area you can keep an eye on.
 Candlesticks, pictures, knickknacks, and other home d√©cor items should be some the lower-priced items in the sale. Exceptions are made for antiques or items that are rare or expensive, such as high-quality art.

 Pay specially attention to those written by women who have experienced it, or who work with it! Reading about other women's experiences will help you to understand the variety of possibilities during menopause, as well as reassuring you that you're not experiencing menopause alone.


A good book to begin with is Dr Christiane Northrup's The Wisdom of Menopause: The Complete Guide to Physical and Emotional Health During the Change., Use books or the internet to research physical and emotional symptoms. Knowing what to expect will help when you're feeling irritable, dissatisfied, or impatient. Tracing these moods back to the reality of menopause will help you to work through them, rather than viewing yourself as suddenly ill-tempered., There are plenty of stories about the dreadful journey women go through when experiencing menopause, often published in women's magazines. The reality is that these stories highlight the less usual experiences; the more sensational and unusual the experience, the more newsworthy but that doesn't mean it's a reflection of the average experience.Look for books and articles that reflect good or neutral experiences, rather than simply bad ones.
 If you don't know what to expect from menopause, you'll be more vulnerable to the horror stories, the pressure to undergo treatments that you might not necessarily want to have, and the worry that your changes are out of your control. One way to combat this is to simply hear first hand accounts from women that you know! This will expose you to a variety of unique experiences., Information is power that leads to wisdom. As you absorb information on menopause, trust your own intuition, your critical thinking skills, and especially your body to tell you what is true for you.You probably know much more than you think!

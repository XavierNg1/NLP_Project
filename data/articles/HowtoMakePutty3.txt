 Boil 100ml (7 tbsp) water.
 In a separate bowl, stir together 100g (Â¾ cup) cornflour, 30 mL (2 tbsp) custard powder, and 75 mL (5 tbsp) olive oil. The olive oil helps the putty stay together, but you can skip it if you don't have any.









In the US and some other regions, cornflour is sold as corn starch. Do not use actual flour made from corn.
 A few drops should do it, in whichever colour you like.
 Pour the boiling water into the mixture, along with a drop of white wine vinegar.
 Lay out some tin foil in a tray, making sure it goes over the edges. This minimises the risk of spillage. Slowly spoon the mixture onto the foil. Let it spread out by itself.
 When you take it out, it should be set and done. Just peel off the foil and mould it into whatever shape you want!

 Consider factors such as the age of the house and what plumbing problems you've had before. While a simple auger may not be adequate for every situation, a power auger requires you to lug a heavy spool around to clear the smallest drain clogs.


A hand-cranked auger is a long cable with a threaded bit that pushes down into the drain until it contacts the obstruction. A hand-crank turns the bit, which bores into the obstruction
A power auger may come with its own motor or it may be attached to a drill that uses a motor to spin the bit. The motor makes getting through the obstruction easier and faster. You can reverse the motor to help pull the obstruction out of the pipe.
 Leave 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) between the drain and the crank so you can operate it easily. If you have too much cable between the drain and the crank, it may kink.
 The bit will push against the obstruction, which may be enough to clear it. If not, the bit will bore into the obstruction.
 If you are using a power auger, stop when the motor slows down.
 If that doesn't work, pull to see if you can break up the obstruction. If you are using a power auger, reverse the motor a few times to see if the obstruction breaks up.
 If it doesn't, use the auger again to bore into more of the obstruction. Keep working until the obstruction is completely broken up and the water drains well.
 Find the clean-out pipe, which may be close to the house on the outside or in the basement or crawlspace. Thread the auger through the clean-out pipe and work as before.

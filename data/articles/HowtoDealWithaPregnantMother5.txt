 Your mom may stay at the hospital for a few days with the baby. Find some time to visit and meet your new sibling!

, They call it “labor” for a reason: having a baby is hard work! If you visit your mom after she has the baby, she will probably look pretty exhausted.


When your mom and the new baby come home from the hospital, she will spend a lot of time resting. She will be tired, because new babies are up a lot during the night.
If you can, offer to watch the baby so she can take a nap.
 Your mom will spend a lot of time taking care of the baby and bonding with him. You may feel like you are not important to your mom. Ask your mom to set aside some time for just the two of you each day. Be willing to be flexible, however. New babies are not good with schedules!
Your family may have lots of visitors to welcome the new baby. The new baby may get a lot of attention, and a lot of presents. It is normal to feel jealous. Let your family know if you feel left out.
 Nothing makes a parent happier than seeing a special bond form between siblings. (It’s normal if this takes a while, though.) Hold, play with, and talk to the baby. You may even want to welcome the baby with a special gift!

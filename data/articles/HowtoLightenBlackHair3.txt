 Though highlights will not make your hair uniformly lighter, the right application of subtle highlights can lighten the tone of your hair overall. If you are afraid of committing to a completely new and lighter color, a trip to the salon with this goal in mind might be for you.
 This is a excellent way of testing out new colors without having to commit. An inexperienced stylist or an overconfident friend can leave your hair an embarrassing shade. By digitally adjusting your tint, you will better know whether lightening is really worth it.
 Believe it or not, some teas have lightening properties. Boil some water and steep one bag of chamomile tea for roughly 10 minutes. Be sure you allow the tea to cool and then rinse your hair with the mixture, allowing it to remain in your hair for about 15 minutes.For extra lightening strength, repeat this process several times before you shampoo or rinse your hair clean.
 Cinnamon also has lightening properties in addition to its wonderful aroma. Add cinnamon powder to your conditioner until it forms a paste and coat your hair from top to bottom. It's important you do so evenly; you don't want irregular coloring! You may want to comb this mixture into your hair to ensure an even application.After the cinnamon is in, put on a shower cap and allow it to set for at least six hours, though overnight might get you even better results.

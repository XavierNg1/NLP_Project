 Gently place your dog in the sink, but continue holding them. Have the faucet running lightly and slowly introduce your dog to the warm water. Be sure to keep water out of their eyes. Be gentle and reassuring; if the dog is anxious, try giving them a treat.
 Shampoo and conditioner specially made for dogs is best to use. Gently apply shampoo to your dog's coat, lathering softly; do not scrub. Wash from head to paws, and use a soft bristle toothbrush to gently clean the area under the dog's eyes. Rinse gently; repeat with the conditioner.
 Make sure to rinse your Shih Tzu thoroughly to get all of the product out of their fur; soap residue can cause skin problems. If your dog resists being rinsed off with water directly from the faucet, fill up cups of warm water to pour onto the dog gently. Praise your dog for being well-behaved while you finish up their bath.

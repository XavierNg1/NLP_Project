 A friendly gym is a gym that is owned by your team. You don't have to put a Pokémon of your own in to do this.
 It can be any Pokémon in the gym, as long as its motivation isn't full (the heart above the Pokémon is filled.), With the new gym update, feeding a Pokémon enough berries may eventually earn you candy!

If you feed a Pokémon too many berries, it will become "very happy" and you cannot give it berries for a short period of time.

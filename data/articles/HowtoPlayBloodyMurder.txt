 Everyone should put his or her foot in.;
,, Whoever it lands on is "it."

, Then everyone counts "1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock rock, 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock, 6 o'clock rock, 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock, 9 o'clock rock, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, LUNCHTIME! 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock rock, 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock, 6 o'clock rock, 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock, 9 o'clock rock, 10 o'clock 11 o'clock, 12 o clock MIDNIGHT!"

, Then, when someone sees him or her, the person who is "it" can't move and the person who is not "it" can't move until the person who is not "it" yells "BLOODY MURDER!"

, If you touch base, you can come off of it.
 If multiple people are tagged, the first person tagged is "it." If one person is tagged, then he or she is "it."

, Do you want mods for a recent version or an old version? If you get Forge for the wrong version of Minecraft and the mods won't load and your Minecraft launcher may just close and re-open. To easily select the correct version, go to the section of the page that says "Select Minecraft Version," click the box that says "All," then find your version and click it. It will then show only results of that version.
 Click the link that says "installer." DO NOT click the link that says "Installer-Win." The page will then take you to an adfly. DO NOT click ANYWHERE below the taskbar. After five seconds, click the button that says "skip ad" JUST BELOW the taskbar.
 When you open it, click "OK." It will install.
 If you have never played Minecraft on the version you are installing it for, you have to load (play) that version at least once. Now that you have Forge installed, you can get some mods.

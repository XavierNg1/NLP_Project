 This is usually done by spamming, arguing or clearly not being who you claim to be. Then you will probably be the spur of the Neoboards.;
, You will eventually be recognized, thus making you famous. The user Furiously is a good example of this.
 People who run guides or make graphics will always be popular.
 However it can be hard to be original and funny as there are so many out there.
 To do this, play a lot of games and do your dailies. This step will take time and patience.
 If you want to go where everyone knows your name then establish yourself in one of these areas. However as Help Chatters are sticklers for rules and Battledomers are experts in their own area you will need to do a lot of research and hard work to keep up. Also, the Help Chat tends to have an in-crowd, if you get in with them you would be automatically famous but if they dislike you, it will be almost impossible to become famous on the HC. A good way to become famous on the BC is play the BD a lot, and share your tips with everyone.
 Now this step will need time, effort, and energy as well as perseverance. Stick to it!

 Throw 5 cups of de-seeded watermelon into the blender. Make sure no seeds remain.;
, Add ¾ cup of lime juice, ½ cup of sugar, and ½ cup of tequila.
 Blend on high speed until well combined. Your mixture may be slightly pulpy.
 Run the mixture through a strainer or mesh sieve. Sit the strainer over the glass bowl so the mixture runs from the strainer into the bowl.
 Pour the mixture into popsicle molds or Dixie cups. When filling Dixie cups, pour mixture approximately ¾ full.
 Slice the limes into small, round slices. Don’t go too thin as you will be sliding the popsicle stick or spoon through the middle of the lime.
 Push the stick or spoon through the middle section of each lime.
 Set the lime and stick/spoon in the middle of the poptail. When using a spoon, allow the spoon part to stick outside the popsicle.
 Freeze overnight or until the poptails harden and turn pink. Gently remove from the mold and serve.

The end result should display a bright pink top with a green, lime bottom. Just like a watermelon.

 For the cheesecake stuffed strawberries, you’ll need 24 large, ripe strawberries. Use a sharp knife to cut the stems from the berries so you can sit them upside down. Next, cut a deep “X” in the strawberries from the bottom to the top without cutting all the way through.Make sure that the strawberries are washed and dried before you cut them.
Instead of cutting an “X” into the berries, you can use a small melon baller to scoop out the center and create a well for the filling.;
, Add 8 ounces (226 g) of cream cheese, ½ cup (63 g) of powdered sugar, and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract to a large bowl. Use a hand mixer to blend the ingredients together on medium until the mixture is light and fluffy, which should take approximately 2 minutes.You can mix the filling in a stand mixer if you prefer.
 Once the filling is mixed, use a spatula or spoon to place it inside a piping bag that’s fitted with a star tip. Carefully open each strawberry around the “X” cut, and pipe the filling inside.If you don’t have a piping or pastry bag, you can place the filling inside a plastic zipper bag. Squeeze out the excess air, close the bag, and then snip off a corner of the bag to create a piping bag.
 After you’ve filled all of the strawberries, place them on a cookie sheet. Chill them in the refrigerator for approximately 1 hour to ensure that the filling is set., When the stuffed strawberries are filled, remove them from the refrigerator. Dust the tops of the berries with crushed graham crackers, and serve.If you don’t want to garnish the strawberries with crushed graham crackers, you can top each one with a blueberry instead.

 You might have a family background where all of the girls married their high school sweethearts. Or, you might come from a culture where you don’t have multiple boyfriends but court with the intention of marrying someone. Take note of your own personal background when deciding if it’s time for a serious relationship with a boy.


Your religion or culture might have specific opinions on things like sex or birth control. While it may sound fun to rock the boat and do something rebellious, keep in mind that the rules you know might be in place to keep you safe.
Remember, you are your own person and can have your own ideas and opinions.
However, it may be in your best interest to respect the rules and culture around you.
Whether you choose to go along with what everyone around you is doing or go off on your own about having a boyfriend, keep in mind that your choices will still impact others.
 Your own town or school might have different ideas about dating or when it’s best for a girl to have a serious boyfriend. You can go along with those practices if you want, but keep in mind that just because everyone is doing something, doesn’t mean that it’s the best idea for you.


For example, if all the boys in church group don’t date until they want to get married, it’s best to wait for them to ask you out instead of trying to force a relationship.
 Someone like a pastor, priest, or guidance counselor can be a good resource and person to talk to if you’re ever in a difficult situation. Sometimes it's best to wait to have a boyfriend if marriage is the main focus of your family's culture or religion.


Some organizations or even schools sometimes have rules about dating. It’s best to respect those guidelines about relationships so you don’t get yourself into trouble.It may seem fun to be rebellious or edgy, but having a boyfriend for the sake of breaking rules or making a point is unhealthy.

 You should check the soil for its moisture level every day if the weather is still relatively warm (up to 80 degrees Fahrenheit/27 degrees celsius during the day) and every other day when it’s cool. It should feel moist and cool to the touch, but not soaking wet. If your soil is dry or a light brown color, it needs water! This is true whether your mums are planted in the ground or in a pot.If your plants or soil get really dry, make a few small holes in the soil with a pencil and then fill them with water.
 If you planted mums in the spring, they should be fertilized once a month until they bloom in the fall. You don't have to worry about fertilizing florist mums planted in the fall - they're hearty enough to survive without fertilizer.You should use a 5-10-10 fertilizer for mums. The 5-10-10 ratio refers to the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the fertilizer, and 5-10-10 ration means there should be twice as much phosphorus and potassium as nitrogen in the fertilizer. All fertilizer brands will show on their labels what the ratio is.
 This just means pinching off the top of the mum plant while it’s still green and growing. You should pinch the top ½ inch (1 cm) or so off when the plants are 6 inches (15 cm) and 12 inches (30 cm) tall. It actually encourages more blooms when the plants finally flower in the fall.If you want to get a more precise edge when you're taking off the top of the mum, you can use garden shears to cut the plants back.
 Once your mums bloom, you’ll find that some blooms fade quicker than others. Remove them by gently pinching the bloom at the base of the stem and pulling it off. This encourages the plant to grow more blooms and keeps your plant looking fresh.

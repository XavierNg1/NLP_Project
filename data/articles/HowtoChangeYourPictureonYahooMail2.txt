 In order to change your Yahoo Mail profile picture, you'll need to access your account's settings from within your inbox.
 This is located in the top right corner of Yahoo's site; its icon resembles an envelope.


If you aren't already logged into Yahoo Mail, you'll need to do so with your username and password in order to access your inbox.
 This option is on the far right side of your inbox page.
 You should see this at the bottom of the Settings drop-down menu.
 Make sure you click the section of the silhouette that has an outline of a camera on it; doing so will prompt you to upload a photo.
 You can use any photo on your computer; if you want to upload a photo from a website, you'll have to download the photo in question first.


Click "OK" to upload your photo when you've chosen one.
 You have a couple of customization options available after uploading:


Click one of the arrows above the photo to rotate your picture 90 degrees left or right.
Click and drag the slider below the photo to zoom in or out.
 You should now see your chosen photo displayed as your profile picture!

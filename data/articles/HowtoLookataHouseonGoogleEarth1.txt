, Use the search box on the upper left corner and enter the exact and complete address of the house you want to view. Click the Search button beside the search field to continue.


Just like in Google Maps, Google Earth will bring you to the location you’ve entered. At first, the area view may be too far up to be able to focus on the house.
 At first glance, you may not see the navigation area on the right of the map. Hover over it and it will appear clearly. You will see some navigation buttons to help you move around the map.
 Before you can view the house, you have to focus on it first. Use the navigation buttons and arrows to move around the map and look around. Stop when you reach the house.
 Once you’ve reached the view you want, you can now use the vertical navigation bar to zoom in for a closer look. Click the plus button at the top of the bar to zoom in. The map will immediately adjust as you zoom in. Continue to zoom in until you’re at the level of detail of the house you want to see.
 Wait a few moments for the rendering to be completed for the house. Once it’s done, you can see the house very clearly and vividly, as if you’re right in front of it. You can again use the navigation buttons to move around the view of the house.

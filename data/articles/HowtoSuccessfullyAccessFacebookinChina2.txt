 A proxy is a website, often based in a different location than you, that will let you access other sites through it. So if your proxy is in the USA, and you access Facebook through it, it should be like accessing Facebook in the USA. Here is a list of free proxies for you to try.

China keeps finding and blocking them too.
They often don't have good enough programming to handle the technology of social media

, The one I've used which works well for Facebook and other social media is Proxy Center. They have a free trial so you can make sure that it will work for you before you pay anything, or even give them your email. Benefit of a proxy like this (as opposed to a VPN, which we talked about in the previous step) is that there's nothing to install on your computer - it's all web-based.

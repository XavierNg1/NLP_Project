 If your self-consciousness stems from poor body image, then one thing you might try is focusing on all of the things that your body is capable of doing instead of focusing on what you can’t do. Try making a list of all the things you can do with your body to help you develop a more positive body image.For example, you might list things like, walking, jumping, lifting X amount of weight, or swimming. List as many things as you can think of and review the list often. As you build your fitness, you can add new items to the list.
 Having a negative body image may be due in part to criticizing yourself on a regular basis. To combat critical thoughts about your body, try taking a moment every day to compliment yourself.Give yourself specific compliments, such as, “Your eyes look beautiful today!” or “Your shoulders are looking strong and sculpted!”
Look at yourself in the mirror as you compliment yourself.
 Saying negative or unhelpful things to yourself can also affect your body image. Try to combat any negative or unrealistic thoughts that you have by changing them into something that is more realistic.For example, if you catch yourself thinking, “I am so out of shape!” then you could replace this thought with “I am working towards a fitter body and that takes time. But I am making good progress and I am going to stick with it.”

 It can take longer for an arthritic horse to return to dressage after time off. Instead of doing dressage training seasonally, consider doing it all year long. This will help keep your horse’s joints and muscles moving and maintain its flexibility. If an off season is necessary, try to limit it to no more than one month., If your horse has arthritis, there is a good chance that it will take them longer to warm up than a horse that does not have arthritis. Before doing any dressage training, you the horse should get in a walk that is at least ten minutes long., An arthritic horse will need to cool down for a longer period than a non-arthritic horse. This will ensure that the horse’s heart rate and breathing have returned to normal. A longer cool down will also enable the horse’s body temperature to regulate, and its muscles and soft tissues to relax.

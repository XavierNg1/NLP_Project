 Choose a sock that looks like it has seen better days. Bits missing, dye runs and anything else wrong with the sock will make it the ideal candidate for turning into a zombie sock puppet.


Green fuzzy socks make for a sickly looking zombie.
If the sock is white, consider painting or dyeing it a darker color; it doesn't matter how messy a job you do!;
, The top of the sock will be where your fingers end when you place the hand in the sock. Just below this area, draw a very large mouth using fabric marker.
 Paint it like a big "O", with black paint.
 Paint on fang-like teeth at the top and bottom of the "O" shape. Use white fabric paint for the teeth.
 Use red fabric paint for blood dripping from the mouth of the zombie. Paint some blood on the upper lip as well.
 Scars can be shown by a long line with some shorter cross lines added on.
 Make sure that they're not level as no self-respecting zombie would have eyes on straight. Use buttons for the eyes; for best effect, have one small button and one large button.
 Add a bunch of long red threads hanging out from the center of the button (eyeball), to suggest more streaming blood and general messiness.

 Attach a lock to it and make sure that it is secure.


It’s also good to set rules on who can open the door to the cage. If you have children who are keen on the quail, tell them that they have to have permission or you have to be with them to open the quail cage.
 Invest in a better cage or fix the cage up a little. The wiring holes should be 1/2 of an inch so that the quails cannot get through them.
 Close the door and windows of the room at all times and keep pets out. A good room to keep them in is:


A place with low traffic such as your bedroom (if you don’t mind your quail being kept indoors). If your quail does manage to escape from the cage and people are constantly opening doors to get into the certain room where your quail is kept, there is a more chance that your quail would get through the door and get lost.
In a barn, shed or garage. This might be better than keeping your quail outside because if they escape you can easily find them in that certain area.
An empty room. This way, if your quails escape, you will not need to spend a lot of time trying to catch the quail with annoying objects in the way.
In an enclosed area. If your quail live outdoors, placing their cage in an enclosed area can prevent them from getting lost in bushes, grass and trees. Make sure you enclose the quails area at the top as well as the sides.
 Clipping your quails wings will prevent them from flying when frightened so if you have an entrance on the top of your quails cage they cannot get out. It also prevents your quail from flying away and getting lost meaning that if they escape, they'll be very close and most likely in your garden.

 Prepare your bath time items beforehand to avoid leaving your baby unattended. Get a large, soft towel to lay your baby on, or use their changing station – you need to give your baby sponge baths before their cord falls off, not submerge them in water. Gather a sponge or another soft towel, cotton swabs or Q-tips, a bowl of warm water, gentle baby soap or cleanser, and a clean diaper and clothes., Keep your baby’s cord clean by washing your own hands before handling your baby. Use soap and warm water to lather your hands well for at least 30 seconds, and rinse them thoroughly.Wash your hands before and after you change your baby’s diaper, and any time you’re going to touch their umbilical area., Dip a cotton swab in warm water and squeeze the end to get rid of extra water. Clean the skin around the cord and the base of the cord with the cotton swab. Keep the actual cord dry.Don’t use alcohol. This used to be recommended, but now it’s advised to just use water., If there’s dirt, feces, or urine around the cord, add a little gentle baby cleanser to your water and use this to clean the area with a fresh cotton swab.Use a gentle wiping motion; there’s no need to harshly scrub.
 Use a clean, dry cloth to hold the umbilical stump until it is completely dry. Pat or blot the surrounding area dry (don’t rub).Once the cord is totally dry, you can put on your baby’s fresh diaper. Don’t cover the cord with the diaper – fold the top down or cut out an area for the stump.
 Usually, the umbilical stump will fall off naturally within three weeks from when your baby is born.Do not pull off the umbilical stump; it's important to let it fall off naturally.While you're cleaning the cord area, look for signs of possible infection such as pus or drainage, redness and swelling in the area, or if your baby is lethargic, fussy, or has a fever.A little dried blood around the stump is normal, but take your baby to the doctor right away if you notice any signs of infection.

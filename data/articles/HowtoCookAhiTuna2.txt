, Choose a glass or ceramic dish that's just a little bigger than the size of the tuna steaks or fillets you're baking. Use olive oil to grease the bottom and sides of the dish so the fish doesn't stick.
 Rub each steak or fillet with a teaspoon of either melted butter or olive oil, then season with salt, pepper, and the dried herbs of your choice. The tuna itself will be the star of the show, so keep the seasoning light and complementary.


A squeeze of lemon juice complements the flavor of the tuna well if you want to add a little extra flavor.
You could also season the tuna with classic pairings like soy sauce, wasabi and ginger slices.
 Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake until the skin is no longer pink and flakes when poked with a fork, about 10 to 12 minutes. The actual cooking time will depend upon on how thick your steaks are.After 10 minutes, check the steaks to see if they need more time.


Err on the side of undercooking the tuna, since overcooked tuna tends to be dry and take on a fishier taste.
If you want the baked tuna to be seared on top, turn on the broiler and broil the top for the last two to three minutes of cooking.

 Avoid rushing to the movie theater on an empty stomach. Not only will you be more inclined to head to the snack bar, being hungry may interfere with your overall enjoyment of the film.;
, Dieters have reported that chewing gum can help curb cravings. Instead of munching on popcorn, try a stick of gum with long lasting flavor (avoid the kind that loses its flavor right away, prompting you to keep adding a fresh piece).
 Avoid movie times that occur at lunch or dinnertime. Also, if the movie is playing when you typically have a craving, meet that craving before you go (such as a need for caffeine or sugar).
 Bring the candy into the theatre in your purse, or if you're a guy, your coat/jacket. You can save a boat load of money this way, and you can also buy the candy you like without paying 3 times as much for it at the movies.
 Only allow yourself to spend a certain amount of money on snacks--if you only have $5 then you know you may have to reconsider sizes and amounts.
 If you can purchase a package of licorice at the grocery store for three times less than what the movie is selling it, refrain for making the purchase. Overpriced items will eat away at your budget and put you in a position to pay far more than you should.
 Make sure you request that the menu includes prices, that way you can survey what is offered and what you can expect in terms of money.
 Sometimes the best way to determine the best route is trial and error.



Ask about discount days or specials (such as $1 popcorn, etc.).
 Theater personnel are trained to up-sell the larger size, however decide if itâ€™s truly worth the money and/or if consuming more of the product is in your best interest.

 You can purchase chopped nuts at the grocery store, or buy some regular nuts and chop them yourself. Use whichever kind you prefer – pecans, almonds, cashews, walnuts, and so on. Not only will they add that nutty taste, but they’ll add some delicious texture to your otherwise gooey brownies!, Grab a bag of your favorite candy or a couple of your favorite candy bars. Then, chop them up into chunks and toss them into your batter – pretty easy! You can do this with Reeses, Snickers, peppermints, Butterfingers, M&Ms, Milky Way, or whatever candy you love.Avoid the chewy, fruity candies like Skittles or Sour Patch Kids. Those will not do well in the oven (and probably wouldn’t taste great with chocolate!).
 Cream cheese is a popular ingredient for decadent frostings, so try putting it directly in the brownies for an extra treat. Purchase a package of cream cheese (8 ounces, 226 grams) and warm it up in the microwave to soften it. Place it in a bowl, and then add half a cup of sugar, one egg, and one teaspoon of vanilla. Stir all of these together thoroughly.Once the ingredients are mixed, pour it over the uncooked brownie batter in the pan.
Take a knife and swirl the cream cheese mixture throughout the brownie batter, making a neat marbleized pattern. Bake your brownies like normal.
 You can add a sweet kick to your brownies without a ton of extra calories by adding in some different kinds of fruit. Coconut flakes are simple to mix into the batter. Other options are maraschino cherries, raspberries, or even blueberries. If you're adding canned fruit to your brownies, you can substitute the oil in the brownie recipe for the juices in the can. This will make your brownies deliciously fruity and lower in fat.If your goal is healthy (or healthier) brownies, add in some flaxseed. Flaxseed is a super food that is high in fiber and Omega-3 fatty acids.

 Chicken marsala is made with thin pieces of chicken that taste delicious breaded and lightly fried. Most chicken breasts are an inch or two thick, so it's necessary to butterfly them. To do this, lay a breast on a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to slice it in half lengthwise, stopping about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from the other side. Open the halves of the breast; as you can see, you now have a "butterfly"-shaped piece of chicken that will cook much more quickly than a regular breast.









It's no big deal if you slice all the way to the other side, and end up with separated "butterfly wings."
If you have breasts that are already sliced thin, skip this step.;
, Place the chicken pieces on a cutting board. Lay a piece of plastic wrap over them. Use a mallet, a meat tenderizer or the bottom of a heavy glass to pound the pieces until they are each about 1/4-inch thick.
 Sprinkle salt and pepper over each piece of chicken. Turn the pieces over and sprinkle them on the other side. If you wish, add a pinch of cayenne pepper to spice things up a little.

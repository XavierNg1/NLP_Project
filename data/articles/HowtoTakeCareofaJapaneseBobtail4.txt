 Your cat will be more willing to accept a grooming session when it is relaxed and happy. You might choose, for instance, to groom your cat right after you’ve finished playing with it., Before you start brushing, conduct a visual inspection of your cat’s skin and coat. If you notice any wounds, bald patches, redness, lumps, masses, or other signs of irritation, contact your vet., The flea comb is a fine-toothed comb that helps you locate flea excreta – tiny comma-shaped black flecks that will turn red when mixed with a drop of water. If you find flea excreta using the flea comb, contact your vet so they can recommend a flea control program for you and your Japanese Bobtail.Use the flea comb once each week.
 If you see any knots or tangles in your cat’s fur, rake your fingers carefully through the fur to loosen them. Push your fingers along the cat’s fur toward its head to better detect and loosen any tangles or loose fur., Use a metal comb to brush your cat from its head to its tail. Use short strokes, focusing on one area at a time. Combing will prevent tangled fur and limit the amount of fur the cat sheds around your home.Generally, you should brush your Japanese Bobtail once each week. Brush it more often during the spring and fall, when it sheds more often.

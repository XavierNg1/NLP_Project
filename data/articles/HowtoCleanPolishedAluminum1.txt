 This attachment goes on the head of a power drill. You can buy polishing balls in most hardware stores. Read the description on the packaging to make sure the ball will fit the head of your drill., Any time you use power tools that could kick up debris, you should cover your eyes and mouth. Put on a pair of goggles and a face mask. For good measure, wear a welding shield to protect the rest of your face., Aim for a diameter of about the size of a dime or 10-pence coin. Just about any kind of toothpaste will work. However, if you're concerned about abrasions, use toothpaste with baking soda.Alternatively, you could make a baking soda paste. Mix baking soda with water. Use 2/3 cups (185 g) for a long-term supply. Add water drop by drop and mix thoroughly until the baking soda becomes a paste. Apply a dime-sized dollop to the polishing ball.
 Hold your drill with both hands and touch the polishing ball to the aluminum surface. If your drill has multiple speeds, set it to low. Otherwise, make sure the drill goes no faster than 1200 RPM. Glide the ball over the surface of the engine cover until all dirt and grime have been removed. Reapply the toothpaste as needed., Dampen a clean cloth with warm water. Remove any remaining toothpaste or grime. Use circular strokes as you move across the surface. Continue this process until the entire surface is free of debris.
 Use only a clean, dry towel to avoid depositing unwanted dirt. Move over the surface with gentle circular strokes. Make sure the cloth absorbs every last drop of water to avoid the appearance of water spots on the surface.

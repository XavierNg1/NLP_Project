 Place the butter and marshmallows into a saucepan over a medium heat. Stir the mixture constantly until the marshmallows are fully melted. Now add the popcorn and combine thoroughly until each kernel is coated. Allow it to cool slightly.;
, Place a little oil on your hands and begin to form small balls out of the popcorn. Set them aside on a tray. Now drizzle a few drops of food colouring on top of your brain balls to give them that veiny, bloody look. Refrigerate to cool.
 Your gruesome Marshmallow and Popcorn Brain Balls are now ready to serve. Your friends will just die for themâ€¦

 You can’t use tap water because it has minerals and other impurities that will trigger ice formation during the cooling.Purified water removes these impurities allowing this experiment to work.



Water expands as it freezes, so ensure the bottle isn’t completely full before you proceed.
 Make sure wherever you put the bottle, it won’t be knocked around if someone else opens the freezer. If possible tell friends or family not to use the freezer during the remainder of the experiment.



If you live where the temperature outside is below freezing, you can put the bottle of water outside.
 The amount of time needed to supercool the water will vary based on the temperature of your freezer. A good measure is to also put a bottle of tap water in the freezer. Once the tap water is frozen, your pure water should be supercooled and still in its liquid state.Starting at 2 hours, check the bottle of tap water every 15 minutes to see when it freezes.
When the tap water is completely frozen, the pure water will be supercooled.
If your pure water is also frozen, you may have waited too long, bumped the bottle during the process, or the water wasn’t completely pure.
Melt the water and try again for a shorter amount of time.
 Carefully take the bottle of water out of the freezer. When liquids are supercooled a quick motion can cause it to crystallize into ice.
 There are two fun ways to cause the water to freeze: shaking the bottle and pouring the water onto a piece of ice. After shaking the bottle, the water should freeze quickly freeze in the bottle. This is often called snap freezing.Pouring the water onto ice will cause the water to freeze as it hits the ice. As you continue to pour the water will freeze on top of itself.

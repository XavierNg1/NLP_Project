 If you have a birthday coming up, be sure to let your family know you are trying to save money and that you would prefer money instead of a gift.
 Ask your parents to take you to their bank one Saturday to help you set up a bank account. You can earn interest on the money you deposit into your account, and setting up a savings account (versus the old fashioned piggy bank) will make you less likely to spend on a whim.


If you are worried that you will spend your money instead of saving it, you can also limit the amount of money you can withdraw out of your account each month. While having a debit card is convenient, consider forgoing this option, as it makes it easier for you to spend, rather than save, your money.
 Itâ€™s never too soon to start budgeting your money! Maybe you want to save money to buy a computer or a nice Christmas gift for someone. Determine how much you will need and how long you have to save. Create a monthly saving goal so that you have enough money when you need it.

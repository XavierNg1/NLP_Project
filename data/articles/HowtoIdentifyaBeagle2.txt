 Beagles have a loud and persistent bark. Because beagles are hounds, they are vocal dogs that tend to howl when they are playing or approached by strangers. Although persistent barking can be trained out of a beagle, they will generally still get vocal when excited., Like other hounds, beagles have excellent noses and love to sniff things. If you are going for a walk, a beagle will be constantly sniffing its surroundings. When encountering new people, one of the first things that beagle will do is sniff the newcomers to familiarize itself with their scent., Beagles have a reputation as smart but difficult dogs. This means that they can be hard to train. Beagle puppies tend to have more issues with house training and training, in general, can be more difficult in comparison to other breeds.

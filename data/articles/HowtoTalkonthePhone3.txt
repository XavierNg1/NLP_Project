 Just because you can't see the other person's body language doesn't mean your own isn't important. It may help you to pace around while you talk, or gesture with your free hand. Smiling while you talk will both help you come across as friendly and open, and make you feel more friendly and open.


Some people also find it helpful to look in the mirror while they speak on the phone.
 Before you make the call or answer the phone, take a few deep breaths with your eyes closed. If you have any little routine's that help you relax, put them to use before and/or during the call., As with all things, practice makes perfect. If you really want to get better at talking on the phone without getting nervous, get a job that heavily involves phone calls. Over time, it will go from something that induces apprehension and dread to something you can do without even thinking about it. You can also practice by calling your friends or family just to talk. Plan for the conversations to be short so you don't have to worry about carry it on too long., If you have to make calls for your job on a regular basis and you have trouble sometimes overcoming phone call anxiety, it can be helpful to prepare some lines. It's best not to rely on these as a crutch, but they can be useful when you're getting started. They can help you get the dialogue going and give you something to fall back on when you're unsure of what to say.For calling customers, these lines can be something like "I hope you've enjoyed doing business with us," or "thank you for calling *blank*, how can I help you?"

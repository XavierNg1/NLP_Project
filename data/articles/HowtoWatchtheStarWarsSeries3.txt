 The machete method is an interesting method which completely disregards Episode I, The Phantom Menace. This particular method believes the Episode I does not convincingly provide the audience with enough valuable information to consider it one of the major films.
 This provides you with enough information about Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. However, the twist in the Empire Strikes Back revealing that Darth Vader is Luke's father raises the question as to whether or not Luke will follow in his father's footsteps.
 These two films display Anakin's slow decent to the dark side in his Jedi years. The climatic ending of Episode III reveals that Anakin is indeed Darth Vader, and that he is the father of Luke Skywalker.
 After witnessing Anakin betray the ways of the Jedi and embrace the dark side, the audience is left wondering whether or not Luke will do the same as his father. This is where Episode VI comes along. Revealing all of the family relations, and seeing who brings balance to the force.Â Machete Order:


A New Hope (Episode IV)
The Empire Strikes Back (Episode V)

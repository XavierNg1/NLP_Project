Find out how soon you can get a copy of the disclosure form if it is not available at the viewing. Having the form is important for your knowledge and to help you negotiate a price if you decide you want to buy the house.



Look for major physical problems such as construction defects, structural issues, problems with leaking and flooding and potential issues from lead paint, plumbing or electrical hazards.
 You will likely have your own inspection done, but if one was completed recently, you can be sure you are looking at an accurate disclosure of defects.



Decide what you will insist on. For example, if termite infestation is disclosed, you might not want to buy until that is cleaned up. If asbestos is disclosed, you might ask to have that eliminated before you buy as well.



Make an offer that accounts for defects in the disclosure. For example, you could offer less than the asking price because you know you will have to replace the roof in 2 to 3 years.

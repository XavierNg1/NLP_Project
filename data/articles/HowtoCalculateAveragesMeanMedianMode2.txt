 The median is just one measure of central tendency. It is the middle value of a series of numbers.You can use the median for any series of numbers, but It is especially helpful to use it when you need to find the middle of a data set that has an outlier. An outlier is a number that is outside the normal range of distribution. 

For example, you might need to find the average rating customers gives a server at a restaurant. The ratings might be -1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 3, and 10. The 10 rating is an outlier (perhaps given by the server’s mom), because all of the other ratings are much lower on the scale. In this case, using the median, rather than the average, would give you a better feel for the middle of the data set. 


, Make sure to arrange all the numbers in the series, including 0 and any outliers.

If you are working with negative numbers, remember that they are less than 0 and should appear before positive numbers. 

For numbers that appear in the series more than once, make sure that when you reorder, you include each instance of that number.

If you are working with a large data set, it might be helpful to use a spreadsheet program, like Microsoft Excel, to sort your values. Read Sort a List in Microsoft Excel for more information on how to do this. 

For example, if your series is...−1,2,3,1,0,3,10{\displaystyle -1,2,3,1,0,3,10}...you would rearrange them in the following order:−1,0,1,2,3,3,10{\displaystyle -1,0,1,2,3,3,10}.
 To do this, find the number in the middle of the group that has the same amount of numbers before and after it. This middle number is your median.

For example, if your series is −1,0,1,2,3,3,10{\displaystyle -1,0,1,2,3,3,10}, the median is 2{\displaystyle 2}, because in the series three numbers are less than 2, and three numbers are greater than 2. 

If you have an even number of values in the series, you will need to take the mean of the middle two numbers. For example, if the series is 0,1,2,3{\displaystyle 0,1,2,3}, the median would be the mean of the two middle numbers (1, 2):1+2=3{\displaystyle 1+2=3}3÷2=1.5{\displaystyle 3\div 2=1.5} So the median in this instance would be 1.5.

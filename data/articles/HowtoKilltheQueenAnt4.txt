 Ants are attracted to sugary, sweet things. If you have a messy home with lots of food particles, especially sweet crumbs, this could lead to an infestation of ants. Ants may also be drawn to water, especially in dry climates. Cleaning your home can help remove the reason for the ants, including the queen, to be in your home in the first place.Take your time to do a thorough cleaning. Look under and behind furniture. Take special care with the kitchen, dining room, and children’s bedrooms. Look under the fridge, in drawers, and in pantries for any open or spilled sugary foods or beverages that may attract ants.
 Ants leave scented trails for others in their colony to follow. Wiping the trail away or even mopping won’t eliminate it. Instead, try using vinegar to wash away the scent trail the ants follow to find food or their nest., If you want to help keep ants away, try natural solutions. Line any windowsills or doorways with coffee grounds. You may also want to put cinnamon, crushed eucalyptus, crushed chilis, cayenne pepper, diatomaceous earth, or camphor oil around common entry points in your home to keep ants away.Placing garlic in cabinets and pantries may keep ants away.
You can also place natural plants in your home that repel ants. Mint and lavender will help ants avoid your home. Using plants helps reduce any chemical dangers and puts nice plants in your house.

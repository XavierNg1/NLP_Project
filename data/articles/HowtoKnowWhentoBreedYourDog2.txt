 Vulvar swelling is the first physical indication that your dog is entering the heat cycle. The vulva will appear swollen and distended from your dog’s body. This is quite distinct and you should notice it with your naked eye. Depending on the size and breed of your dog, this initial stage can last 4 to 15 days.During this early stage, referred to as proestrus, the female will not allow breeding.
 During proestrus, your dog may have some vaginal bleeding. This bleeding will diminish and the blood will take on a browner hue as she gets closer to ovulation. Your dog may lick the blood off itself, so you will need to be vigilant., During this initial stage, you may also notice that your dog will urinate more frequently. Your dog may need to walk more frequently. It may also act more agitated because of increased pressure on its bladder. If you notice that your dog is urinating more often, in combination with a swollen vulva and vaginal bleeding, your dog has likely entered heat.This increase in urination is a result of your dog releasing pheromones and hormones that let male dogs know that she will be ready to breed soon.
 The best time to breed your dog is 10 to 11 days after you notice the first bleeding. Once the bleeding disappears, your dog is in estrus and ready to mate. You should then breed your dog every other day after that for three days. You should utilize this information in conjunction with your veterinarian’s recommendations to ensure that breeding is a success.If you know that your dog is entering heat, you may want to put a white sheet in your dog’s bedding so that you will know when it starts bleeding.
Most dogs are the most fertile in the first 48 hours of estrus.

,,, To do this, take the end of the string and carefully thread it through the head of the needle. Insert the needle all the way through the first hole of the paper and cardstock. Wrap the thread around to the left, and insert the needle into the next hole down. Repeat until you reach the bottom of the book. If you still have thread left on your needle, then turn around and continue sewing the book the other way until you run out of thread. If this wasn't clear enough, check out an article on sewing., Make sure the strip of fabric is wide enough to wrap around the sides of the book, too. Be very careful when you use superglue; it is super sticky. Squeeze superglue around the sides of the fabric. Very carefully wrap it vertically on the spine, over top of the stitches. Press it down. Let it dry before you do anything else, you don't want to inadvertently glue your fingers together., Decorate the cover of the book. Make it unique and personal; it's your sketchbook. Consider making a collage of magazine clippings, or photos, or whatever you want. Paint the front of it. Write your name in bubble letters. Do whatever., Take it with you whenever you can, and in your free time, sit down by an object that interests you, and draw it to your best ability. If you mess up, don't erase it or rip out the page. Keep it so that the next time you draw the same thing, you can look back on your mistakes and prevent yourself from repeating them. If you run out of pages, tape some more pages in on top of others. Make a sketch on a big piece of paper, then fold it up and tape it inside the cover. It is literally impossible to run out of space in your sketchbook, because it is expandable. Well, I can't really tell you what to do anymore, because it is your sketchbook and it's none of my business. Enjoy.

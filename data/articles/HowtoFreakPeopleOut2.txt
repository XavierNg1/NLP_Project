 Making loud, emotional outbursts is a sure way to shock, frighten, and otherwise freak out the people around you. Make reasonable decisions about when and where to be loud, though. Don't shout anywhere that you're likely to get yourself in trouble or cause a serious incident, like in a movie theater, in a room where a test is taking place, or around police.


Sing loudly and/or in another language. Pick annoying songs. Sing in unusual styles - for instance, sing raunchy raps like an opera singer and well-known gospel tunes like it they are death metal songs.
Have outsized reactions to small problems. When you experience a small inconvenience, have a reaction that's far louder than necessary. If you notice your shoe is untied, shout, "OH GREAT! THIS AGAIN! JUST WHAT I NEED!" When you kneel down to tie your shoe, keep going: "OH, NO, NO ONE NEEDS TO STOP AND HELP ME HERE. YEAH, JUST KEEP ON WALKING!"
Pretend to have a very loud speaking voice. In your normal, daily conversations, use a very loud voice, but pretend like it's your normal voice and it's difficult for you to speak more quietly. Don't outright shout - it's funnier if you can convince people your condition is real.

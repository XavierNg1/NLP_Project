 Using a tarp to train horses to cross the water is simple and painless.The tarp will imitate the surface that the horse will encounter when walking through water. Lay a 6’ x 6’ (2 meters x 2 meters) tarp on the ground. Place an orange traffic cone on each corner.


Walk across it several times so your horse can see that it is a safe and secure surface.
The traffic cones are designed to keep your horse moving in a straight path over the tarp. Some trainers use a wooden rail instead.If you use a wooden rail to guide your horse, ensure it can be later moved and assembled easily at a site of actual water.
This method can be used with a horse of any age, but is most appropriate for older horses who have not had much exposure to water.
 Holding your horse’s reins in one hand, slowly lead your horse across the tarp. This will help the horse learn to trust you and build up its own confidence.


Don’t stand in front of the horse, or it will think that the goal of the exercise is to come toward you.
Let your horse sniff and explore the tarp before it walks across.
Train your horse barefoot on the tarp. If your horse is shod, its horseshoe might catch on the tarp, and cause the horse to panic.
 Place two cones in front of the water. Guide your horse into the water while standing at one side.


Over time, you can gradually expose your horse to deeper waters, up to a level that reaches the middle of its chest.
If your horse is hesitant to jump in water even one meter high, start out with a wide puddle just a few inches deep. Work your way up from there.
 Water that is even just a few inches deep can help acclimate a horse to the process of walking through water. Walk your horse through shallow water, then trot it back through again. Repeat frequently to build your horse’s confidence.

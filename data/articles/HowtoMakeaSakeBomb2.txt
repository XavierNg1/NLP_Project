 It can be done in English but it's most authentic if done in Japanese, which is simply ichi, ni, san.


Some people finish by shouting "Sake bomb!" or "Kampai!". (Kampai means something like "Cheers" in Japanese.)
Another chant is simply "sake, sake, sake!".
 This needs to be hard enough to dislodge the shot glass but not so hard you injure yourself!

, Once it lands and the beer starts frothing, drink fast! Get it all down in one go.
 If you are with someone else who is having a sake bomb, try to time the table banging at exactly the same time and drink down your own bombs at the same time. It's just more fun that way!

,
Simply drop the shot glass of sake straight into the beer.
Drink quickly.

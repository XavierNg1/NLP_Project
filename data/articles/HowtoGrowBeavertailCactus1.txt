In a shady garden bed, simply scatter the seeds on the soil. There's no need to cover them, unless you want to use netting to keep the birds off. Keep the soil moist until the seeds germinate.
Make sure that the garden bed is in the shade. Beavertail cacti seeds need shade to grow, whereas cuttings need plenty of direct sunlight.
Be aware that growing Beavertail cactus from seeds takes much longer than growing one from a cutting. It can take as long as 4 to 4 years before you get flowers.

Enter your height, weight, gender, activity level and weight loss goals into an online calculator.
Write down the number of calories that you should eat per day in a journal or on your smartphone. Make sure you aren't losing more than 1 to 2 pounds per week.



If you calculated calorie goals for a 1-pound weight loss per week, then you can burn up to 3,500 calories with exercise to lose an additional pound.
If you calculated calorie goals for a 2-pound per week weight loss, then make sure to replace any calories that you burn while exercising with food. For example, if you burn 300 calories while exercising, eat 300 calories of healthy food to compensate.
 Write down all meals and all exercise performed so that you are accurately tracking your calories.

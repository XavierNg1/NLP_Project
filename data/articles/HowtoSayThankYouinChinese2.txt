 This is the standard way of saying “thank you” in Cantonese.Cantonese is spoken mainly within southern China. Outside of mainland China, it is spoken by most people living in Hong Kong and Macau. It is also spoken within many overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia, Canada, Brazil, Peru, Cuba, Panama, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and the United States.
Even though this is the most common way of saying “thanks” in Cantonese, it is almost always used in response to thanking for someone for a tangible gift. Thanking someone for a favor requires a different term.
In native Chinese characters, spell the response out as 多謝.
A rough pronunciation of do jeh is daw-dyeh.
If you are thanking someone for a gift in advance, say "doh je sin” instead of “doh je.”

, If someone performed a service or favor for you, this would be the correct way of thanking him or her in Cantonese.


This response would not usually be used when thanking someone for a physical gift. It is generally used for services. For instance, you would say “m goi” to a server at a restaurant after he or she refills your glass but not as a response to a birthday present.
Using Chinese characters, m goi is written as 唔該.
A rough pronunciation of m goi is mm gai. The mm is said in a fairly neutral tone, while the goi or gai rises toward the end.
Switch to "m goi nei sin" when you are thanking someone for a service before that service is actually performed.

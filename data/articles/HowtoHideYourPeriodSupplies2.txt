 They will assume that you have a bunch of pens or pencils in there, and would never guess that you actually keep pads or tampons in there. Choose a flat pencil bag for pads. Choose a narrow pencil box for tampons. You can also use a makeup bag instead.


How many pads or tampons you bring depends on how heavy your flow is. Some girls will need to change theirs out more often.
 Pads come in large, bulky packs that are hard to disguise. They also take up a lot of valuable locker space. Instead, keep enough pads to last a day or two in your locker. Bring more pads with you when you run out.


Store these pads in a pencil case or a makeup bag.
 Choose a side pocket, or better yet, an inside pocket. Stick enough pads or tampons to last you a day or two. This way, when you have to use the restroom to change out a pad or tampon, you can take your bag with you. People will assume that you are simply protective of your belongings.
 Pads and tampons are the must-haves for any girl's period, however, there are a few extra items that can make the period more bearable. Here's a list of items you might want to consider having in your locker or bag:Pain medication (note that not all jobs and schools allow this)
Spare underwear in case of unexpected periods
An extra sweatshirt, to tie fashionably around your waist, in the case of leaks.
Feminine wipes, to clean yourself up in between changes
Emergency chocolate

, Try to keep these (especially the feminine wipes) with the rest of your tampons or pads. This way, you will have everything together, and won't have to take as much with you when you go to the restroom.


Feminine wipes are like baby wipes, but they contain no harsh chemicals and are specifically designed for sensitive regions.

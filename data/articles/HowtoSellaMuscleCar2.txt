 Muscle car enthusiasts want to continue their collection at the best price possible, so be ready to work with potential customers.
 This can include specific classified pages for enthusiasts of your specific make and model.


Consider joining any online forums and groups specific to your make and model, if you haven't done so already. Many online forum members welcome the opportunity to get a first look at a car for sale of which they are already a fan. Online sales outlets have also become increasingly popular for classic cars, as most muscle car enthusiasts will make a trip for a good car at a good price.
 You might even consider putting your car up for auction with a reputable car auction house or dealer.
 Post an announcement about your car sale on any and every social media site you use. Use those same sites to update people about your car project. You never know if a friend already had his eye on your car and was just waiting for you to sell it.

 Hold the mango under cool running tap water, and gently rub it with your hands as you rinse it.You may also use a clean vegetable brush to scrub the surface of the mango, but this isn’t necessary since you will not be eating the skin.

, Using your non-dominant hand, stand the mango up on a cutting board. You will be cutting the mango downwards from the top of it.With your dominant hand, pick up a serrated edge knife.
 The fruit itself is the shape of an oval. When you cut the mango into thirds, make two parallel slices on either side of the pit in the middle, which is about ¾ of an inch thick.









The fattest two edges of the mango are called the “cheeks.”
When cutting the mango, you want a to preserve as much of the cheeks as possible, since this is the part you eat.
You will end up with three pieces: two halves with lots of mango flesh on them, and the middle section that has the pit.
, The mango segments will stick out, almost like a hedgehog’s back, which is why this is sometimes called the “hedgehog method.” Now, you are ready to remove the majority of the mango flesh.
 Now, you can trim the segments of mango flesh off with a knife and serve it. Careful—the skin is very thin, and if you cut into the skin, you could cut your hand. Sometimes, if the mango is ripe enough, you can simply remove the segments with your hand. Other people like to eat the segments straight off the skin!








, Lay the slice with the pit flat on the cutting board, then trim around the pit with the paring knife. It can be difficult to tell where the pit is, but in general, it begins where the mango is too tough to cut through. It will also be oval-shaped.
 Use your fingers to gently remove the skin from the slice of mango that has the pit. The skin is very thin and is easy to peel off.

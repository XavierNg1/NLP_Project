 Pour a little bit of acetone on it. Spray spot cleaner, such as 409, next to that. Let it sit for six minutes. Clean the area with a steam vacuum attachment. See if the acetone or spot cleaner caused any damage to the carpeting.Use a carpet sample or extra piece of your carpeting, if you have it. Otherwise, find a concealed area of carpeting, such as inside of a closet.
Some carpet fibers and dyes may be sensitive to chemical cleaners., Dampen a cloth with acetone, or use an eyedropper to apply acetone directly onto the stain.Blot the stain with the cloth. Move to a clean area of the cloth when it becomes soiled with paint.This process may make the stain appear worse before it gets better. Don’t worry! The acetone is lifting the paint to the surface of the carpeting for removal.
Wear gloves and a mask when using acetone. Ensure proper ventilation by opening windows and running a fan if needed.
Don’t pour acetone directly from its container onto the carpeting, or it’ll leak down into the padding.
 Spray the stain with a spot remover such as 409 cleaner. Use a toothbrush in side-to-side and circular motions to work up a cleansing foam in the carpeting. Allow the foam to sit for five to six minutes., Prepare the water tank of your steam vacuum according to the appliance’s instructions. Run the vacuum and use an attachment. Cleanse the portion of the carpet with the stain and stain remover foam.Repeat this entire method until you achieve satisfactory results.

 Most of the toxins found in the kidneys are natural waste products of digestion, and by feeding a food that breaks down more "cleanly" the need for detoxification of the kidney is lessened. A number of prescription diets are available that are protein restricted, and hence when digested produce less toxic waste.Examples include Hills Canine K/D diet and Purina Canine NF.;
, Unfortunately, to be effective these diets need to be fed exclusively, since the beneficial effect is lost if less than 90% of the diet is renal food.


It is worth noting that it is an urban myth that chicken is suitable for pets with kidney disease. Chicken is almost purely protein and once digested presents just as many problems to the ailing kidney as other protein sources.
 Phosphate can be found in many foods, as it is included as a preservative and a flavoring agent. However, phosphate is particularly hard for the kidney to excrete and it can cause scar tissue in the process. Another issue is that high phosphate levels may irritate the stomach lining and can make your dog feel nauseous.Prescription renal diets, such as those listed in the first step of this section, are phosphate restricted.
 If your dog refuses to eat a special diet, you can try adding Renalzin your dogâ€™s food. This is a product designed for cats (because of the high prevalence of renal disease in felines) but it is equally effective for dogs.


Renalzin is added to food (approximately 1-2 pumps per 5 kg body weight, twice a day) and binds to the phosphate in the food so that the phosphate stays in the bowel and does not get absorbed into the bloodstream.

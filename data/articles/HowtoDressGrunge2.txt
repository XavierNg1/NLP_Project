 Grungers generally stick to boots and sneakers that can be laced up (all the better to dance in at grunge shows m’dear.) In particular, combat boots such as Doc Martens (or knock-off Docs) are a big part of the grunge look. If you can find a pair of Docs at a thrift store, you’ve hit the jackpot., Other grungy shoes included beat up high-tops (such as Converse) and other types of shoes that sort of look like Converse but are cheaper. Again, head to a thrift store to see what kind of scuffed up kicks you can find.
 While they definitely won’t keep you warm, ripped up stockings are an essential part of any grunger’s wardrobe. Pair them with a black baby doll dress, some big old boots, and devil red lipstick and you’ll be good to go.
 Grungers aren’t really known for wearing hats, but beanies are sometimes seen gracing the heads of grungy guys and gals. Avoid beanies in bright colors (never, ever choose a neon-pink beanie.)


Not feeling a beanie? Pull out a faded bandana and wrap it around your head, neck, hair, whatever.
 If anything, invest in a cool leather bracelet. If you have your ears pierced, wear simple earrings that aren’t too shiny. Also buy a choker, not those big diamond ones just the basic ones with a little charm if you like. Tattoo chokers are really great. Dressing grunge is not about dressing to impress. You could also consider getting gauges.

 Hang bar racks and wall rings where you know you’ll need a towel.


Tuck a metal towel ring behind your bathroom cabinet, directly across from your sink, and store a hand towel or washcloth there.
Install bar racks beneath your counter top that houses your sink, and hang your hand towels there.;

Position a bar rack directly next to your shower or above your bathtub. Arrange your body towels on that rack, so that anyone stepping out of the shower has quick access to a towel.
 If you have a relatively small bathroom or if you simply do not want to clutter the space with towels, a double-bar rack allows you to reduce the amount of room your towels take up. These racks have two bars: the first bar is positioned higher and against the wall and the second bar is lower and extends further out. The extra bar allows you to hang twice as many towels in virtually the same space.
 This method is another alternative for individuals with limited bathroom space and those seeking to minimize clutter. The towels essentially share the same space your door uses, so they are not taking up much room. Moreover, when your door is open, the towels remain hidden altogether.
 Bar racks are the most common fixture used to hang towels, but hooks are just as functional and do not require you to fold your towels before hanging them. You can either customize the number of hooks you need by hanging individual hooks on the wall or opt for a “coat rack” style fixture, which consists of multiple hooks fixed onto a single board.
 If you have the space, prop a tall wooden ladder against one wall of your bathroom to introduce a touch of rustic, artistic flair. Hang your towels along the middle and upper rungs.
 This option works especially well for a guest bathroom, since the hangers can be easily moved from the bathroom to the bedroom as needed. Hang full towel sets on the hanger, including a body towel, hand towel, and washcloth. Hangers with metal clips may help hold the towels in place.

 Slouching may seem like it will help you to appear shorter, but it will not. The idea is to make yourself appear less tall because slouching rounds your back and shoulders. This may lower your height one or two inches, but it can also cause you to appear unhealthy or like you lack confidence. Slouching appears less professional and can cause physical pain and permanent spine damage.Instead, practice good posture because it makes you appear confident and is better for you. Confidence is the key to fashion for tall men and women.Place your shoulders back and keep them relaxed.
Look in the mirror and make sure that from the side, you could draw a straight line from your earlobe to your ankle.
 Always take the opportunity to sit when you can find it, especially at social functions where there are few other tall people. Sitting can help people forget that you are tall because it puts you on the same level.


If you have a long torso, try to find a chair that is lower than others, or a bar stool or office chair that is adjustable.
 Stay aware of your position in relation to the person you are having a conversation with. If you are on a platform that places you higher than the person you’re talking to, find a way to step off of it. Even though you’re taller than the other person, being on even ground with them is better than being positioned even higher.


For example, if you stop to talk to someone on the stairs, step down a few steps.
 To minimize how much others notice your height, try standing around people who are also tall. For example, during gym class or on the playground, look for tall people and go make friends with them. Finding others of the same height can also make you feel less self-conscious and more confident, therefore less likely to slouch.


If no one’s height compares to yours, find the tallest people you can.

 Use this method if you know:

two different speeds; and

that those speeds were used for the same distance.

For example, if Ben drives the 160 miles to the waterpark at 40 mph, and returns the 160 miles home driving 60 mph, what is his average speed for the entire trip?


, The formula is s=2aba+b{\displaystyle s={\frac {2ab}{a+b}}}, where s{\displaystyle s} equals the average speed, a{\displaystyle a} equals the speed for the first half of the distance, and b{\displaystyle b} equals the speed for the second half of the distance.Often problems requiring this method will involve a question about a return trip.

In these types of problems, it doesn’t matter how far each speed is driven, as long as each speed is used for half the total distance.

You can modify the formula if given three speeds for the same distance. For example, s=3abcab+bc+ca{\displaystyle s={\frac {3abc}{ab+bc+ca}}}., It doesn’t matter which speed you substitute for a{\displaystyle a} and which you substitute for b{\displaystyle b}.

For example, if the first speed is 40 mph, and the second speed is 60 mph, your formula will look like this: s=(2)(40)(60)40+60{\displaystyle s={\frac {(2)(40)(60)}{40+60}}}.
 This number should be the numerator of your fraction.

For example:s=(2)(40)(60)40+60{\displaystyle s={\frac {(2)(40)(60)}{40+60}}}s=480040+60{\displaystyle s={\frac {4800}{40+60}}}.
 This number should be the denominator of your fraction.

For example:s=480040+60{\displaystyle s={\frac {4800}{40+60}}}s=4800100{\displaystyle s={\frac {4800}{100}}}.
 This will give you the average speed for the entire trip.

For example:s=4800100{\displaystyle s={\frac {4800}{100}}}s=48{\displaystyle s=48}. So, if Ben drives 40 mph for 160 miles to the waterpark, then 60 mph for the 160 miles home, his average speed for the trip is 48 mph.

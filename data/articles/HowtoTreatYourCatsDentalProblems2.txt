 Gingivitis is often caused by a build of tartar on the teeth, which presses on the gums and inflames them. Tartar is a matrix of minerals, food, and bacteria, and it is the latter which then colonize the gums to set up infection.
 Broad spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin-clavunate penetrate well into the gum tissue and saliva so that they can fight the infection. Amoxicillins are bactericidal (kill bacteria) and act by inhibiting cell wall synthesis. A cat weighing less than 6 kg commonly takes 50 mg of potentiated penicillin by mouth twice daily.If the gingivitis is mild (a faint red line along the border between gum and tooth) a five day course is sufficient. If the gingivitis is severe (touching the gum gently provokes bleeding) then a minimum of two weeks is necessary.
 Oral hygiene products help decrease the amount of bacteria in the mouth and are useful as part of a dental care regime, especially for cats prone to gum infections or bad breath. An example of such a product is Hexarinse. The active ingredient is chlorhexidine, a mild anti-septic. The hexarinse is liquid and comes in a bottle.


To use, dip a clean cotton tip into the liquid and wipe the dampened bud over the surface of the enamel and along the gum line. Never dip a used cotton bud back into the hexarinse as it could contaminate the solution.
Hexarinse repels bacteria for 12 hours and should be repeated twice a day.This is also a useful preventative treatment in a healthy mouth, in order to promote best oral hygiene.

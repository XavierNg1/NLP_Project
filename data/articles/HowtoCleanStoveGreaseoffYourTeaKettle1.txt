 Stainless steel kettles can easily be cleaned with ammonia or oven cleaner. You can get both of these products at a local department or grocery store. Wipe down the kettle with one of these substances, using steel wool, to remove any type of stain, including a grease stain.You can scrub your kettle with a steel wool pad with a few drops of either oven cleaner or ammonia. Scrub it the same way you would scrub metal cookware and keep scrubbing until the stains come off. Then, rinse your kettle completely to remove the cleaner.
However, never use ammonia or oven cleaner together. Some oven cleaners contain bleach, which makes a deadly gas when mixed with ammonia. Do not use ammonia if you used bleach to clean any part of the kettle, including the inside.;
, Bleach is safe to use on kettles made with enamel or porcelain. It can effectively remove a variety of stains.These types of surfaces will scratch easily, so do not use abrasive cleaners. Use a soft rag or sponge to apply a few drops of bleach to your kettle and gently wipe it down until the stain comes off. Avoid harsh scrubbing.
Make sure to use gloves when handling bleach.
Dilute any bleach you use according to the package's instructions.
 In general, you should not use commercial cleaners on copper. Copper is a more sensitive material and is easily damaged by chemical-based cleaners like bleach, ammonia, and oven cleaner. Only clean copper kettles with natural ingredients.

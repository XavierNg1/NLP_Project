 It's recommended that you put newspaper on your working space, to protect it from glue and paint.;
, Wrap it with newspaper, making sure to cover every little bit of the box. Make sure that the newspaper sits tightly, then stick it down with a few pieces of tape.
, Soak the strips in the tub of PVA. Drape the soaked strips over all parts of the box until it is fully covered. Let it stand to air dry.
 Once the paper strips have dried, mix the yellow and brown paint on the palette to get a uniform, nice shade of yellow-brown/light brown colour. This might take a while, so keep combining until you like the color.
 Using the paintbrush, apply the light brown paint on one face of the box at a time. Leave in a safe place with sunlight to air dry.
 Rule three rows and 10 columns on one broad side of the box, using a pencil.
 Keep using a ruler to keep your lines straight.
 With pencil, draw in the following symbols:


In the second/middle row, sixth column from left, draw an ankh sign (symbol of life).Â 
In the last row, sixth column from left, draw a bird in the Ancient Egyptian style.
In the last row, seventh column from left, draw three parallel waves.
In the last row, eighth column from left, draw three dots (like an upside down "therefore" symbol).
In the last row, ninth column from left, draw an eye of Horus.
 Using a thin paintbrush, paint over the ankh symbol in blue paint, the bird in red, the waves and the dots in blue and the eye of Horus in red.
 Once done, the Senet game board is now ready for playing Senet.

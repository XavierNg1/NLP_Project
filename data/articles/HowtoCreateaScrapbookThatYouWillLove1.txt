 It doesn't have to be expensive or flashy either, just the right kind you want. Also, get the vital craft materials if you don't already have them, such as craft glue, scissors etc.
 Go bargain hunting in shops such as Poundland or The works, and look for materials such as pretty backgrounds or beautiful sheets of paper. How about special little extras too, such as stickers, 3D stickers, special labels or just mementos you like? Anything that can transform a scrapbook into a better keepsake and more personalized!

,,, Of course, your scrapbook can be about absolutely anything you want but, if you're stuck for inspiration or don't have much ideas, why not take a look? It may be better to not have a theme and base it around your life, because if you do that you have so much more things to include then just one topic.

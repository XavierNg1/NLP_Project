 Shrinking a chip bag requires a few simple kitchen items, including two baking trays, two sheets of parchment paper, and oven mitts. Gather these items while preheating the oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit.;
, Get all of the crumbs and other food particles out of the bag. Leaving them in will cause bumps and irregularities in the bag after it shrinks. Dry the bag with a paper towel to help remove leftover particles., Lay the chip bag between two sheets of parchment paper. If you want your chip bag to have a flatter, smoother look, place the second baking tray on top of the parchment paper, sandwiching the bag between the trays. For a wrinkled look, leave off the second tray., Place the tray in the preheated oven and allow to bake for 10 minutes. Check the bag every 2 minutes to gauge its progress and make sure the bag is not being damaged. After the ten minutes are complete, remove the tray and peel the parchment paper apart to reveal your tiny chip bag.


Take care when removing the tray and handling the bag. Both will be hot after their baking period.
The bags will be small and hard, and generally difficult to shape. The bags become easier to bend if they aren't fully shrunk.
A bag will shrink down to approximately 25% percent of its original size depending on whether you cook it for the fully suggested time, or a lower time.

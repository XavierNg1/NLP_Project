 You use a kettle or the microwave to do this. Try to use distilled or tap water, if you can, as ordinary tap water contains too many minerals and chemicals.


If you are using the microwave, heat it for 1 to 2 minutes.;
, Ideally, the water should be warm. It can be hot, but it should not boiling. Adding honey to boiling-hot water will destroy the good enzymes in honey that make it so healthy.
 If you don't have a very big sweet tooth, use only 1 tablespoon (15 grams).
 Use the same spoon that you measured the honey with. This way, you won't waste any honey.
 The honey will make the water very sweet, but you might like your water even sweeter. Keep in mind that the honey is only supposed to lightly flavor the water. You don't want to drink something that is practically pure honey.
 This will allow you to get the most benefits out of the honey. One of the most notable benefits of honey is soothing a sore throat.

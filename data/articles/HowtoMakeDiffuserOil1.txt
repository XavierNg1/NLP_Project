 You can use just about any type of lightweight oil, such as coconut oil, safflower oil, or sweet almond oil. Avoid using solid coconut oil, and other heavy oils, such as extra virgin olive oil and jojoba oil; they will take too long to travel up the diffuser.This method is intended for reed-based diffusers. Do not use it for plug-in diffusers.;
, Stick a funnel into the neck of the bottle first, so that you don't spill and waste any oil.
 Lavender, lemon, mint, tea tree, and vanilla are all popular individual choices, but you can combine different oils to create a more unique fragrance. Here are some combinations to get you started:Bergamot and patchouli
Cinnamon and wild orange
Lavender and eucalyptus
Lavender, lemon, and rosemary
White fir and cypress

, This will also help the oil travel faster up the bamboo reeds.Choose something that is at least 90%.Vodka can be used in place of rubbing alcohol., This will help the different oils (and rubbing alcohol, if you are using it) to blend together instead of just floating on top of each other.
 If your bottle has a narrow neck, you can simply insert some bamboo skewers into it. You can also pour it into your reed diffuser bottle, but make sure that it is clean and all traces of the previous fragrance have been washed out.


When inserting reeds into the bottle, make sure that they are new. Do not reuse old reeds.

 Oftentimes, people make comments without realizing how they come off to others. This person’s insensitive remark could be rectified by causing them to view the situation differently. Present an analogy to help them understand how mental illness is virtually the same as physical illness-you just can’t see it.


For instance, you might say, “That’s an interesting perspective, Andy. Would you say cancer was made up?” or “If someone had a broken ankle, would you tell them their pain was all in their head?”, Most laymen don’t have a thorough understanding of brain science. Mental illnesses are often chemical, biological, and genetic conditions. They can’t simply be turned off. Offer a fundamental explanation of mental illness to shed some light for the person.You may say, “Mental illnesses are very complex, so I can see how you might get them confused. But, most mental illnesses have a biological or genetic basis just like any other disease. There might be an imbalance of brain chemicals or certain genes that make a person susceptible to mood swings.”, Knowledge is often central to overcoming ignorance and stigmatization. If the person is open to correcting their misinformation, you might recommend they visit certain websites to learn more.


Suggest that they brush up their knowledge about mental health conditions by browsing reputable sources like the U.S. National Library of Medicine or the National Institute of Mental Health., Certainly a person who describes mental illness as "made up" is ignorant about what life is like for people living with these conditions. If you overhear them making ignorant remarks, offer a more supportive, compassionate strategy.


For example, you might tell them a better way to help someone is by asking “Is there anything I can do to help?” rather than admonishing the person for being ill (or, implying that they are making it up).

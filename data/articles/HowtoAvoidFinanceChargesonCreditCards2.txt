 There are numerous charges and fees connected to credit cards that you cannot avoid by paying off the balance on time. These include annual fees that are incurred regardless of how much you use the card. By shopping around you can find a card that doesn’t have these unavoidable service charges.


You can search through a database of hundreds of credit card agreements that are available from a variety of companies online.The database is available on the website of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau here: http://www.consumerfinance.gov/credit-cards/agreements/


, It’s important that you spend some time reading up on the all small print before you sign up for a credit card. Read it again before you activate a card, and call the company if you don't understand something. Be sure you know the interest rate and how finance charges are determined. Find out if there are ways for the lender to raise the interest rate, and if anything seems questionable, avoid working with that company.


Check to see what fees there are for balance transfers.
When you use the "checks" that arrive with your bill, these are considered balance transfers and are often subjected to additional fees.
 When you are looking at different credit card agreements you should note whether or not they have a universal default clause. This type of clause gives the credit card company the right to raise the interest rate on your card if you are late paying your credit card bill or any other creditor.The credit card provider can monitor your credit report and alter your rates during the contract.


This clause can also be activated for a high debt-to-income ratio.
Remember that a higher interest rate or APR on your card results in high finance charges.
If you have a card with this clause, pay all your bills on time.

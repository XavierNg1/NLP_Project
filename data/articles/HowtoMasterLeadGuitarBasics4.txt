 One-handed tapping is the high-pitched, incredibly fast sounding guitar popularized by Eddie Van Halen and others in the 80's. To do it, you simply use both hands, not just the picking hand, to hammer on and pull off 3-5 notes at once.
 For the best beginner practice, simply start with two notes. Hammer on one, pull off to the other, then hammer on again, repeating in it until it is fluid and comfortable. Get a rhythm going so that you can keep









One finger should never move -- this will be your root note, the one every pull off comes back to.
 While it may be called one-handed tapping, you do use both hands. Simply start a similar hammer-on / pull-off pattern with the index and middle finger of your strumming hand, so that you have four fingers hammering on at once. From here, you can move your hands further apart, together, to other strings, or up and down the neck.

 While using a tanning bed is not recommended, you can likely do so a few times a year (less than once a month) without adverse effects upon your health. However, more frequent use places you at greater risk of developing skin cancer, in addition to other harmful effects of UV radiation.In short, tanning beds should not be considered a safe way to tan.
If you do occasionally use a tanning bed, wear eye protection designed to be used in this scenario.
For a safer option, use a sun-free tanning lotion.
 The lamps used at nail salons to dry your nails use UV rays to do so. While the amount of radiation and risk of harm is low, it’s worth applying a broad spectrum sunscreen with at least 15 SPF to the back of your hands before getting your nails done., Various industrial and commercial manufacturing equipment requires the use of machinery that exposes the user to UV radiation. Arc welding is a common example, and can cause considerable damage to both your skin and your eyes.In short, if you work with or near UV lamps or other equipment that emit UV radiation, always follow the protocols established by law to prevent injury. These will include wearing both skin protection and eye protection.
 Fluorescent light bulbs, which are commonly used in various indoor environments, emit small amount of UV radiation. While this radiation does not usually cause significant risk, it’s important not to spend time within a foot (30cm) of the bulbs for more than an hour.Though blacklight bulbs do rely on UV light, they do not emit enough radiation to be considered a threat.
 These types of lamps are becoming more popular for a range of different indoor uses. They emit enough UV radiation to cause injury at short distances. Filters will greatly diminish this risk.Note that light bulbs that emit a harmful amount of UV radiation will be labeled with a cautionary warning.

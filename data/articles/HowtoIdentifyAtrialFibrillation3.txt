 If you are suffering from a cardiovascular disease (a disease related to your heart or blood vessels), you may develop atrial fibrillation. A lot of heart diseases can affect how electricity flows through your heart. The change in electricity then changes how your heart beats. Heart diseases that can do this include:


Hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart valve disease, pericarditis and heart diseases that youâ€™ve had since birth (these are known as congenital heart diseases).
 Because your respiratory system (your lungs) and cardiovascular system (your heart) are so intertwined, a problem with your lungs can create a problem with your heart. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are two of the diseases that can affect your heart beat., Your thyroid gland creates hormones that control growth and metabolism. When you have an overactive thyroid (which is called hyperthyroidism), it can affect your nervous system, which controls the movement of electricity through your body. When your electricity gets abnormal, your heartbeat can also become abnormal., Consuming alcohol and caffeine can have an effect on how your heart beats. Caffeine in particular can cause your heartbeat to speed up (an issue called tachycardia) and that can spur on a bout of AF. Stress can also play a factor in bringing on atrial fibrillation. Stress, like caffeine, can speed up your heart, sending it spiraling into an abnormal beat.

 Try to remove the flowers just as they begin to wilt or fade as doing this prevents them from growing seed pods. To deadhead an Iris bloom, either use your fingers or take a clean sharp pair of scissors and snip or pinch off the single bloom just behind the flowerhead.


It’s important to remove not only the shriveled petals but also the green swollen sheath it emerges from, as this is the part that will eventually develop into a seedhead.;
, Try to avoid accidentally removing any remaining flowers as there may be other blooms on the stem yet to open.


Try to get into the habit of checking you plant twice a week or so during the flowering season. Some varieties of Iris (such as African Iris) have blooms which last only for one day but the plant will quickly grow new ones.
 Some Iris varieties (such as the bearded Iris) will often flower twice, once in early summer and once in late summer. Once all the blooms on a flower stem are gone and you don’t expect any more, you can then remove the flower stem from the plant. Removing the flower stem helps prevent rot. To do this:


Take a sharp blade such as a pair of garden sheers. The stem will be quite woody in many iris varieties.
Snip the stem off at the base near the ground about an inch above the rhizome. This stem can then be composted.
 It’s very important to leave the foliage on the plant after the flowering ends, so don’t be tempted to cut the plant back just yet. The Iris will use the foliage to draw energy into its roots to help it survive the winter. Leave the foliage on the plant until it withers away of its own accord.It’s okay to trim off any brown tips but leave as much healthy green growth as possible.
In the fall, once the foliage is withering away, you can cut back the foliage to about 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the ground.

 In a single, microwaveable bowl, add one cup of rice, and two cups of water. If you want to make more rice, make sure to add more water at the same ratio.For example, for 2 cups of rice you’d use 4 cups of water, for 3 cups of rice, 6 cups of water.
Make sure you have a big enough bowl.
 Amount of time you keep your rice in the microwave depends on its wattage.


For a 750W microwave keep your rice cooking for 6 minutes.
For a 650W microwave keep your rice in for 7 minutes., Covering your bowl with plastic wrap will steam it and completely cook it.Do not poke holes on the top of the plastic wrap.
Make sure to use wrap that can be microwaved.
 Refer to your microwave’s instruction manual to see how to reduce its settings to medium. Not reducing the settings could result in overcooked or burnt rice.


Do not stir your rice at any time during the cooking process., Your rice should not be completely cooked. Fluff with your fork to break up the rice before serving it.


Be careful when taking the bowl out of the microwave. It will be hot.

 Pour 1 (32 ounce or 950 ml) bottle of chilled cranberry nectar, 1 cup (325 g) of chilled seedless red raspberry jam, and 1 1/2 (2 liter) bottles of chilled lemon-lime soda into a large punch bowl. Slowly stir the ingredients.To get the red color, you could also use a fruit jelly (like cherry or strawberry). Just use something that doesn't contain seeds or pieces of fruit.
 Remove 1 (1.5 quart) of frozen vanilla yogurt from the freezer and let it sit out for about 15 minutes. This will soften the frozen yogurt and make it easier to scoop. Scoop the frozen yogurt into round balls that look like snowballs. Add the snowballs to the punch and stir them so they start to melt into the punch.For an even rosier punch, you could use a different flavor of frozen yogurt. Try strawberry frozen yogurt for a really vibrant punch.
 Set punch glasses near the bowl or fill glasses with the punch. Ensure that you get a snowball in each glass. Top the red punch with fresh cranberries or slices of orange for a holiday touch.


To make the cranberries look frosty, rinse them with water and roll them in sugar. The sugar will coat the berries so they look frozen.

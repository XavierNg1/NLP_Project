 If all tests to date come back as normal or negative, then the next step is either diagnosis by treatment, or biopsy.


The latter is discussed in the next section, but if the cat is not seriously ill, you may want to consider trial treatment first, because bowel biopsy does carry a risk of peritonitis and a high complication rate.
 If the presenting symptom is vomiting, and all tests prove negative or normal, then the veterinarian may suggest putting the cat on a hypoallergenic diet. The reason for this is that sensitivity to a food ingredient can cause inflammation that leads to vomiting.


A hypoallergenic diet is a food restricted to one protein source and one carbohydrate, or may be a hydrolyzed diet. The latter means that the protein molecules have been broken down so that they are too small to bridge receptors in the bowel wall that trigger allergic reactions.
 The theory behind a hypoallergenic diet is that the bowel gets a chance to settle down because it is not being inflamed by the food. Thus, a chronic vomiter with a food allergy should stop vomiting on a hypoallergenic diet.


If however, the vomiting persists, then bowel biopsy may be necessary.

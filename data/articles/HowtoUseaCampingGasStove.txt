Make sure that both the regulator attachment and cylinder are secured to the gas stove.
Prepare a mixture of 1 part dish-washing liquid to 3 parts water.
Apply the soapy mixture to the fittings at the stove and cylinder, and all along the hose attachment.
Open the regulator valve counterclockwise 2 turns and check for bubbles at both ends and along the hose. Do not leave the gas on longer than 10 seconds. If bubbles occur, turn the regulator knob off and re tighten all the connections by hand again. Repeat the bubble test until all connections are secure.



Open the regulator knob to the fuel cylinder slowly, about 1 to 2 turns. Hold a long fireplace match or fireplace lighter over the burner to ignite the gas. Adjust the regulator knob as needed.
 A camping stove's gas burners will supply the same amount of heat as a gas kitchen stove. A 2-burner stove will allow you the most flexibility in cooking, and should enable you to cook a traditional 2-pot meal, or prepare meats in a pan on 1 side and a side dish on the other side.


Place your pot or pan on your lit burner. Depending on what you are cooking, adjust the level of flame as you would on a regular gas stove. Keep in mind that the fuel from a propane container will burn more quickly than a regular stove, so although you may leave the stove on while preparing your meal, prepare to have a back-up container of propane.

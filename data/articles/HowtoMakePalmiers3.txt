Mix the spices on their own first, using your nose to determine if your ratio is to your liking., You can use lemon, orange, or even limes to get a nice burst of acidic freshness in your cookies, and the sugar will ensure that they never get too tart or bitter.

Olive tapenade
Pesto, You'll want a pinch each of orange zest, cardamom, chai spice, and vanilla bean added to the sugar mixture. Throw in a touch of cinnamon and enjoy the light, delicate results/

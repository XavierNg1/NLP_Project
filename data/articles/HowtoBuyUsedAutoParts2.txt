 Used auto parts are often advertised for sale by their owners in the classified ad sections of local newspapers, magazines, and on classified ad websites. Examples of classified ads websites are Craigslist and eBay Classifieds.


When using classified ad websites, select your state, city, or region, then enter a keyword phrase that contains the names of the make, model, and auto part you need. For example, enter "Honda Civic hubcap" into the search field to find individuals selling that particular auto part.
 Depending on the part you are buying, you may need to verify that the part's condition will not affect its ability to function properly. For example, if you are buying a car muffler, examine the muffler to verify that it does not contain any holes or cracks.
 This practice can often help you determine the reliability of a certain car part. For example, some sellers may be selling the auto part because they recently upgraded the part to improve their car's performance, whereas other sellers may be trying to liquidate the auto part because they are moving.

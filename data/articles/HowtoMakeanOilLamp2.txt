 This lamp uses a jar and a bit of wire. It's great for those who have jars but either don't have the lid anymore or don't want to poke a hole in the lid. Here's a list of what you will need to make this lamp:


Squat mason jar
100% cotton cord or lamp wick
Olive oil
Scissors
Floral wire
Wire cutters

, The thicker wick you use, the larger flame you will get. If you want something small, go for a #2 or Â¼ inch lantern wick., The wire needs to be long enough so that it can hook over the mouth of the jar when doubled. You will be using it to support your wick.


Avoid using plastic-coated, painted, copper, or zinc/galvanized wire.Do not use scissors. Not only could you hurt yourself, but you'll also dull the scissors.
 You are sandwiching the wick between the two halves of the wire. The tip of the wick should be no more than an inch (2.54 centimeters) above the lip of the wire.
 The wire needs to be tight enough so that it can suspend the wick, but loose enough so that you can still pull the wick up and down.
 It's okay if the wick dips down a little bit into the jar. If it dips down too far into the jar, try bringing it a little bit closer to the rim.
 The wire should now be holding the wick just inside the mouth of the jar. If the wire does not hold its shape, you can try wrapping another piece of wire around the neck of the jar, securing the wick-holding-wire to the jar.
 Olive oil is great to use because it doesn't contain dangerous chemicals. It also burns clean and doesn't stink.
 This will give the wick enough time to soak up the oil and allow you to light it.

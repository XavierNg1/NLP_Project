 Even when they live in a large indoor cage, the birds still need daily exercise in the form of freely flying in a room. Do this once the birds are used to their cage and its location. Be sure to close all windows and doors before letting the birds out of the cage.An alternative is a large outdoor aviary in a sheltered spot, where the birds can fly free. Make sure the birds have boxes and sheltered areas where they can roost and sleep at night. Also, make sure that they are not exposed to direct rain or harsh winds. If you live in a harsh climate, an indoor cage might be the better option. , Most finches are very excitable and do not do well with sudden movements or noises. Zebra finches are pretty hardy in this regard. But you should still treat them with care by providing a calm environment for them.
 Zebra finches are very delicate. Give the bird time to get used to you before you hold it. Then you can gradually build up the amount of time you hold the bird. Always handle with care and handle very lightly.
 If your finch gets injured or sick, place it in a separate cage in a warm room. Call your vet immediately.

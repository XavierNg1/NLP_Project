 Ask your child what shape he or she would like (or simply tell your child the shape if your garden space is limited). Using this shape, map out the sorts of things your faerie garden will contain. See ideas under "Tips".;
, It should be somewhere child-friendly and less accessible to dogs, puppies and cats who might mess with it. Fence it off with small garden fences if necessary (little blunt wooden picket fences are cute).
 Do this together with your child, so that the soil is ready for planting and is easy to place the faerie pieces into. Fertilize if necessary.
 A terracotta coloured cement paver is ideal. Place a statue on this square or circle, such as a mushroom, faerie, animal or other feature item that the child has chosen.
 Plant a circle of flowers chosen by the child around the inner circle. Edge this outer circle with upright border blocks (the wavy ones are the most elegant).
 Use river stones, pebbles etc. Place plants inside these circles, or little trinkets chosen by the child. You could also make other shapes with the pebbles, such as cat faces, dogs, triangles, diamonds etc.; imagination is the only limit.
 A faerie table and chairs can be made from various sizes of pavers. Purchase a small child's tea-set from a dollar store and place on the table for the faeries to have tea.
 Listen to their ideas and try to adapt to them with items on hand.
 While watering, they can check for faeries. Encourage them to leave little gifts for the faeries (small pieces of fruit, seeds, whatever they like). This will ease the transition from stubborn disinterest in gardening to enjoying it!

, Invite other family members, friends and neighbors over to marvel at the little garden and to provide the child with encouragement to tend it.

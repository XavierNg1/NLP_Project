 Exercise can help you manage constipation, depression, a lack of attention or focus, and fatigue/drowsiness. Manage these side effects by getting at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week. Moderate aerobic exercise includes swimming, brisk walking, and biking.For example, bike for an hour three times a week after work, or take a 30-minute brisk walk four to five times a week during your lunch break.;
, Drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, can help you manage constipation and urinary retention, dry mouth, headaches and dizziness. It is recommended that men drink 13 cups (3 liters) and women drink 9 cups (2.2 liters) of water per day.Sucking on ice chips and chewing on sugarless gum may also alleviate a dry mouth.
 A balanced diet consists of fruits and vegetables, milk and dairy products, healthy meats such as fish and chicken, and healthy starches (potatoes, bread, pasta). Try to stay away from foods that are high in sugar and unhealthy fats.Eating a balanced diet will help your body manage many, if not all, of the side effects associated with sleeping pills.
 Caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco can exacerbate side effects such as dry mouth, headaches, and dizziness. These substances may also worsen your ability to focus and remember things.Never consume alcohol after taking a sleeping pill. Not only will the alcohol disrupt your sleep, it will also increase the sedative effect of the sleeping pill, creating a dangerous and possibly fatal combination.

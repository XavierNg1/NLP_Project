 It is very fun to explore these stages because you can collect different plants/animals and add them to your scrapbook. To collect them, simply click on them. It is also fun because you can run away from 'vicious' underwater animals like sharks and crocodiles who might attack you, or if you are a 'vicious' underwater animal like a shark or a crocodile, you can chase after 'prey' or pick fights with other 'tough' predators.

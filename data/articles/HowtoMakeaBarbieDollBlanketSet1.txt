 This is where your child can get very creative and go for some wilder patterns. If she wanted a pink, glittery bedspread (and you said “no”) now is the time to let her purchase pink glittery fabric for Barbie--at least one resident in the room will have the glitz!


Pick up enough fabric to make the doll bed and pillow(s). Generally Barbie’s bed is 8 x 10, so make sure you have enough for a 9 x 11 (or more). Also, don’t forget about pillows.
Purchase fabric to “fill” your bedding. Of course if you were making a comforter for a human being you’d need to purchase thick batting. However, since Barbie won’t be getting chilly at night, thick fabric or even stuffing it with cotton will suffice.;
, If you plan to use your sewing machine you may just need thread in a matching color. However, if you are hand sewing, make sure you have an appropriate needle and also a good pair of sharp sewing scissors (for both hand and machine sewing). You’ll also need a measuring tape to ensure all measurements are correct.

 Spin the shackle around so that the opened portion is above the hole, and push it into the opening at the top of the lock.
 Turn the dial in any direction for three turns. It doesn't matter what number you stop on. This process will disengage the tumblers and will make it so that you'll have to start all over again with the first number if you want to open it.
 Make sure it's locked by pulling on the lock or shackle. If it opens, lock it again.

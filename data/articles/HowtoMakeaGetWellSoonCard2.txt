 This is a fun card to make for kids, since it comes with a band-aid you can really use! All you need are some simple supplies you probably already have in the house. Gather the following:


Three plain band-aids.A permanent marker.
Three pair of googly-eyes (optional).
Construction paper in your favorite color.
Clear tape.
 This is the base of your card, so choose your favorite color, or the favorite color of the person you're making the card for. Line up the short edges of the construction paper and crease the fold with your finger.
 Turn ordinary band-aids into a cute little decorations that will cheer up your friend. In the center of each band-aid, draw a funny face using your permanent marker. You can make a happy smiley face or a sick frowny face, depending on what you want. Try to make each one different.


If you have googly eyes, use them as part of the faces. If not, just draw the eyes with your permanent marker.Regular markers will smudge, so make sure to use a permanent marker.
 Space them out evenly on the front of the card. You'll have a top, middle and bottom band-aid, with an inch or two of space in between them. Use two pieces of clear tape to tape down the ends of the band-aids.


Keep the paper backing on the band-aids so your friend can remove the tape and use them.
If you don't want the tape to show, make tiny tape loops, sticky-side out. Stick them to the undersides of the band-aids, then affix them to the card.
 Write the word "Get" under the first band-aid, "Well" under the second band-aid, and "Soon" under the third band-aid. Use all capital letters or cursive handwriting if you want.
 Start by writing the person's name, then write a few sentences to say you hope he or she recovers very soon. Sign your name at the end of the note.

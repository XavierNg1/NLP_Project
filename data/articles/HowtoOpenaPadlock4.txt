 Sometimes lock companies will be able to tell you your padlock combination if your lock has a serial number, which can usually be found as an engraving on the back of the lock. Call the manufacturer of your padlock, or submit a lost combination form by mail, fax, or email., If you're unable to obtain the combination for your lock, you can hire a professional locksmith to pick the lock or to cut the shackle on the lock. Make sure to read reviews of your locksmith and call beforehand to get a quote. Typically a locksmith visit will cost between $50 to $350., Sometimes you can dislodge the shackle from the lock by simply tapping on the side of the lock. This won't help you get the combination or a new key, but could help you open something if it has a padlock and you've forgotten the combination. Apply tension on the shackle by pulling on the body of the lock, then hit your hammer on the side of the lock's body to open the shackle., While a common belief is that you should cut a padlock at the shackle, this is wrong, as the shackle is often made of the toughest metal throughout the lock. Instead, use 18 or 36 inch (45.72 cm or 91.44 cm) bolt cutters and position them over the lock's body. Apply pressure on the handles and try to cut all the way through the body of the lock to remove it.

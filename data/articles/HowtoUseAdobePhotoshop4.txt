 In order to change your color selection, you will want to double-click on the color you wish to change at the bottom of the tool bar. This will bring up a window with several options, the clearest of which is to select the color you want from a mix of the box and the slider (both of which are largely self-explanatory).


If you see a warning exclamation appear next to the color slider, it means that the color you have selected cannot print properly, though it should display on a monitor just fine.
If you see a little box appear in the same area, this means the color you have selected will not display properly on the web. Select the “only web colors” box at the bottom if this is a concern for you.
 If you want to use a specific color, take note of it’s hex code. This will be located near the bottom of the window and will be indicated with a pound or hash sign. Type in this code manually to change the color.
 This is a system of specifically numbered colors which correspond to inks used to print images. This is used mainly for print media to most accurately produce colors. Choose Pantone colors in Photoshop by going to the Color Library and choosing the appropriate number. Resources for and information about Pantone can also be found readily online, as it is the industry standard.
 You can also choose colors from the image itself by using the eyedropper tool. This can often be imprecise, however, so zoom in to your image for more control over the pixel color you are selecting.

 Consider using real instead of fake flowers for this project if at all possible and recycle old books for making the wrapping paper.
 Regardless of the book and gift size, you can piece together sheets from the book to encompass many gift sizes. Simply tear the sheets from the book and then use a ruler and scissors to create an even cut later.
 Consider piecing together the book sheets first and then using it as wrapping paper. Use clear tape that will be on the inside of the wrapping paper for a more seamless look.
 You want a bookish, old-school look, so don’t worry about the fancy flourish.
 Although the string is meant to hold the flowers in place, you may want to add a small piece of tape behind the flower, to ensure it doesn’t fall from the gift in transit.

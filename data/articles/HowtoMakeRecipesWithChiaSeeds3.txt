 Lentil or bean soups, slow-cooker recipes, and casseroles are ideal for adding chia seeds.


Stir the seeds into the broth or sauce and monitor the consistency for about 15 minutes to determine if additional liquid is necessary. If so, consider adding the primary liquid base of the recipe (milk, broth, water, or juice, for instance).
 Because of the nutty flavor and texture, chia seeds can easily be added to sandwich spreads to get extra fiber and nutrients.
 Chia seeds can be added to traditional breading for chicken, pork, and even tofu to add a nutty, crunchy aspect to traditional breadcrumb or cereal-based breading. Chia seeds can also be used in batters for fish or vegetable tempura to add flavor to pan-fried, battered dishes.
 Traditional recipes with a base of rice, such as jambalaya or stuffed peppers, can easily tolerate chia seeds added after the rice has been cooked completely. The meals will benefit from the added nutrients of the chia seeds without altering flavor significantly.
 Homemade trail mix, nut clusters, and snack bags can easily incorporate chia seeds to improve nutrition and add to the nutty flavor of the original dish.

 Before you can hold to your beliefs, you must understand exactly what it is you believe. Spend time reading the Bible and listening to sermons to gain as much information about your faith as possible. Think and pray about the information that you get, and decide exactly what being a Christian means to you.If you have questions about Christianity that you are having trouble getting answered, you could try attending another church occasionally.
For example, many Christians hold different opinions about which parts of the Bible are literal and which parts are metaphors. If you are unsure how you feel about a particular story in the bible, reflecting on it can help you determine whether you believe it to be a true account of history or a metaphor meant to teach you something.;
, You can easily be influenced by new information. While this is not a bad thing, it is a good idea that you write down the beliefs that you currently hold so that you can analyze them in the future. This allows you to compare your behaviors and interactions with both Christians and non-Christians to the beliefs that you hold.


Keeping an ongoing journal about your faith would be a great way to do this.
An example might be to write out something like “I believe that Jesus was the son of God and that he died on the cross.”

, Even though holding to your what you believe is important, you should also be willing to hear other points other points of view. These viewpoints may be Christian or non-Christian, but you can learn from them either way. As you get older, your experiences should continue to teach you new things about yourself and your faith.


For example, many people take each story in the Bible as a historical account in their youth, but later decide to view them as metaphors or parables that are meant to teach Christians how to act.

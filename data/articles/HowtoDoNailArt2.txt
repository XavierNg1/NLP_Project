 Choose two complementary colors that will look great on the same nail.









Apply a basecoat color or a clear basecoat. Allow the polish to dry.
Place a French manicure sticker across your nail, leaving the tip exposed. If you don't have a French manicure sticker, use a similarly-shaped sticker, such as the circular stickers that reinforce punched holes in paper.
Paint the tip color above the sticker. It's okay if you overlap the paint with the sticker a bit.
Remove the sticker while the paint is still wet, so you don't pull of chips of paint with it when you take it off.
Allow the design to dry completely and finish it off with clear top coat.
 Start with a coat of your favorite nail polish and accent it with a pretty decoration.









Apply a base coat color or a clear base coat. Allow the polish to dry.
Place a dab of nail glue or nail gel on your nail. Put it high on the nail, toward the tip, or in a lower corner. Think about where it will look best.
Pick up the jewel or sticker with a pair of tweezers and drop it onto the gel or glue. Use the tweezers to gently press it into place. Allow the glue to dry.
Paint a clear top coat over the nail to keep the sticker or jewel from falling off.
 Try one of these techniques:









Mix loose glitter with nail gel or clear polish and apply it to your nails. When the application has dried, add a top coat.
Cover one or more of your nails with nail gel or polish. Dust the nails with glitter and allow them to dry before finishing off with a top coat.

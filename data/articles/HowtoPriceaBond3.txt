 For instance, a 10-year, $5,000 bond will pay $5,000 when it matures ten years after its date of issue. Therefore, the face value of the bond is $5,000, regardless of any interest or dividend payments you may receive during that time., In most cases, coupon payments occur twice a year. If a $5,000 bond pays 10% annually, then each semiannual coupon will pay $250. That's a total payment of $500 a year (or 10% of $5,000)., In the example above, the coupon payment is $500, and the face value is $5,000. Therefore, the coupon yield can be expressed as 10%, which is $500/$5,000., This gives you the coupon payment as a percentage of the current bond price.If the coupon payment is, for example, $500 and you calculate the bond's price (value) to be $4,800, then the current yield is $500/$4,800, which would be 10.4%.
 This requires some additional calculations. You can read more about this particular calculation at yield to maturity., In the financial industry, a few companies research and rate bonds based on their quality, history and expected performance. The primary agencies that provide bond ratings are Standard & Poor, Moody, and Fitch.Bond ratings are grades given to bonds so that investors may judge the relative safety of any given bond investment. The highest Standard & Poorâ€™s rating is AAA.  AA, A and BBB are medium-quality bonds. BB, B, CCC, CC, C, and D are "junk" bonds. The D rating means the bond has defaulted. 


, A bond is selling at a discount when its yield to maturity is greater than its current yield and its coupon yield. A bond is selling at par when its yield to maturity is equal to its current yield and its coupon yield. A bond is selling at a premium when its yield to maturity is less than its current yield and its coupon yield.

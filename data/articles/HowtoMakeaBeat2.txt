 This is good for that basic beat.
 A kick drum or a tom can make a nice melody. Snares can also be good for this, but work better in rock than in, say, hip hop. Experiment to find out what you think sounds best.
 Rims, crashes, snares, as well as effects like reverb, claps, and bass can add a little more depth to a basic drum beat.
 You want to master the track when it's done, to make sure that none of the instruments are too loud or distracting and that everything sounds great.

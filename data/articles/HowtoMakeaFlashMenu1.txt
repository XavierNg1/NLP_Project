,, You will see 4 frames labeled "Up," "Over," "Down" and "Hit" in the timeline where the button has been added.


Up: this frame represents how your button will look when it has not been clicked on.
Over: when someone scrolls over the button they will see the button appear as it has been drawn in this frame.
Down: the Down frame decides how your button will look while someone is clicking on it.
Hit: the Hit frame shows the appearance of your button after it has been clicked on.
 Here are some tools in your tool bar that can help you draw buttons.


Shape Tools: the 2 main shapes that are available through your tool bar are elliptical and rectangle. You can use these to create ellipses and rectangles of various sizes.
Paint Bucket: use this tool to fill your shapes with color.
Paintbrush: you can create freehand linear drawings using the paintbrush.
Text Tool: the text tool appears as a big "A" icon. You can use the text tool to create a text box and type inside it.

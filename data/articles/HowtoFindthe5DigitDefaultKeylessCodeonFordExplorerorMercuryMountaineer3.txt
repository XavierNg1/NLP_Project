 Ford Dealers can provide you with the factory code by plugging your vehicle into a computer. Retrieving the code in this manner may be quite costly. If the owner’s manual is lost and you do not have the code for Keyless Entry, know that the Remote Anti-theft Personality (RAP) Module also has the factory code printed on its label. The RAP is behind a removable panel toward the back left of your vehicle., Using a flashlight, locate the removable panel and turn two thumb screws counterclockwise to remove the plastic panel. Shine the flashlight onto the RAP module and look for the label containing the 5 digit factory code., Once the first entry is pressed, the keypad will illuminate. Press the middle of the button to ensure proper contact., In order to program your new personal code, hit the 1 / 2 control before 5 seconds has passed from entering the factory code.
 Do not take longer than five seconds in between each successive digit. Your new personal code will be used to unlock your vehicle but you can also use the factory code.Each time a new personal code is set, it replaces the old one and not the factory code. The factory can never be changed. You can erase the code of a previous owner and use the factory-set code without entering a new personal code. Once you’ve entered the factory code, hit the 1/2 button, then the 7/8 and 9/0 controls at the same time. Do not take more than 5 seconds to press each successive button. Once you’ve taken these steps, your system will now only use the factory-set code.

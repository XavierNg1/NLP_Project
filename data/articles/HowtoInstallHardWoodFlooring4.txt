 Once the floor is in place, you can add some type of baseboard trim, usually a type of molding, where the floor meets the wall. What type of baseboard you choose is up to you and will depend on your needs as well as the design of the room.
 Add trim and transitions anywhere where your floor does not meet up with your wall, such as doorways or a section of the room with different floor covering. Trim and transitions should be cut to size and installed according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. This is usually a very simple process.
 If you wish to, you can cover the holes created by the nails with nail putty. This may be a good idea, as such holes can collect dirt and other undesirable material. Be sure to get putty in the color of the wood you are using for the floors, as this will help in blend in.

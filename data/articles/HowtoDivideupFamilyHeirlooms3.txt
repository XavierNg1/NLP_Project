 Whether you are dividing heirlooms before or after a loved one has passed it is critical to have a non-partisan third party involved.It is important to have a person there without emotional attachment to the items. Consider hiring a professional arbitrator or asking a priest to help your family.
, Remember that there are many people and feelings involved in this experience.Think about what is most important to you from the division of heirlooms, and listen to what is most important for each other family member. You will not be completely satisfied with what happens, but maintaining family relationships is more important than getting everything you want.
 Emotions can run high when people begin getting sentimental over family heirlooms. If there is a particular item that everyone is arguing over, put it aside, take a break, and come back to it later. Sometimes family members begin arguing because of hurt feelings rather than a real desire for an item.Itâ€™s important to give yourself time away from the argument to calm down.

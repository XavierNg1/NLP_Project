, Spread the sliced almonds evenly across an ungreased, rimmed baking sheet.


The almonds will toast evenly if there is minimal overlap between the nuts.
Use a rimmed baking sheet to prevent the sliced almonds from spilling over the edges.
 The almonds will need to be flipped or stirred every few minutes, so try not to get distracted by something else or leave them unattended.


After about 5 minutes, open the oven door and stir the almonds around on the baking sheet with a wooden spoon. Alternatively, you could shake the baking sheet to redistribute the nuts.
Close the oven door and continue to stir the nuts every 5 minutes or so.
 The almonds will take between 10 and 15 minutes to toast completely, but you will have to pay careful attention to avoid burning them.


Wait until the nuts are fragrant and turning golden brown around the edges before you remove them.
Don't wait until they turn dark brown, however, because the almonds will continue to cook for a short time after leaving the oven, and will likely end up burnt.
 Allow the nuts to cool completely before using -- this will make them extra crunchy.


If you left the almonds in the oven for slightly too long, transfer them to a cold tray while they're still hot to prevent further toasting.
If you're not using the almonds immediately, you can store them in a sealable plastic bag (once cooled), to preserve their flavor and texture.
 Toasted sliced almonds are very tasty and versatile and can be used in a wide variety of dishes.


Eat them on their own as a quick and healthy snack -- you can drizzle them in a little olive oil and sprinkle them with salt first, if you like.
Use them to add color, texture and flavor on top of salads, desserts and even pizza.
Use them in cake, bread and muffin batters (toasted almonds are less likely to sink to the bottom).

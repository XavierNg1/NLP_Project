 If you don't have a package of Hamburger helper handy, you can make a very similar recipe yourself from common kitchen ingredients. Start just like you would in the sections above: by browning the ground beef. Heat a frying pan on the stove, add oil or cooking spray, then add the beef to the pan. Use your spoon or spatula to break up the meat as it cooks.


As above, you're ready to proceed when the ground beef is well-browned all over and no pink remains.
Drain the excess grease from the pan when the beef is browned exactly as in the sections above.
 Stir these ingredients well to combine. Let them heat to a boil, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.


In the recipe above, elbow macaroni are suggested, but any similarly-sized pasta should work well. Don't use a pasta with significantly smaller- or larger-sized pieces â€” these can have different cooking times.
 When the mixture reaches a boil, add the cornstarch, chili powder, garlic powder, sugar, salt, paprika, cayenne, and red pepper flakes. Stir until the mixture is uniform and well-combined.
 Reduce the heat to medium or low so that the bubbling becomes slow and steady. Cover and cook at this heat for about 10-12 minutes. Stir every few minutes to prevent sticking.
 When the pasta is al dente (softened but with some firmness remaining), turn off the heat. Sprinkle the shredded cheddar cheese over the casserole. Stir well to combine.
 As with the other recipes, the liquid when you're cooking Hamburger Helper from scratch will continue to thicken as the casserole cools. Let the dish sit for at least two to three minutes before serving.

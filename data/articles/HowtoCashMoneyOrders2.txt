 Since the money order has been made payable to a specific payee, you will need proof that you are the payee. Bring your driver's license, passport, or another identity card to prove you are who you say you are.
 Walk up to the teller, post office worker or cashier and tell him or her that you have a money order to cash. He or she may ask to see your money order and your ID.


Before you hand over the money order, ask the person helping you what the fee will be. Even though you've already done research, it's important to make sure you're on the same page with the institution's representative so no miscommunications occur.
Don't be afraid to turn around if you aren't comfortable cashing your money order with a certain institution. If the person helping you quotes a fee that's higher than what you had anticipated paying, try a different bank, grocery store, or convenience store.
 After the person helping you processes your money order, you will receive the amount of the money order in cash. You can usually request to receive bills of a certain size. Count the money to make sure it's all there before leaving the institution.


You might want to ask for a receipt, just in case you miscounted the money and later realized the place still owes you cash.
If you deposited the money order at your bank, you can ask for part of the money order to be given to you in cash.

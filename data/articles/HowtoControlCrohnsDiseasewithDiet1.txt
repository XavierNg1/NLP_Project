 She will be able to help you formulate a diet specifically for you. Keep in mind that your body and your symptoms will respond differently to foods than others who also suffer from Crohn’s disease. Part of finding the right diet will be trial and error at the beginning, but your doctor or dietitian can help you make a plan to begin., Try eating five to six small meals per day rather than three large ones. Some areas of the inner surface of the small intestine are damaged due to inflammatory processes. As a result, the effective length of the intestine is reduced (effective length means the functional part of the intestine that can handle food effectively for digestion and absorption). Thus, the diseased intestine cannot handle the same volume of food as a normal intestine can. If you eat a large meal, a significant portion will remain undigested and will pass into the colon. This portion will be fermented by colonic bacteria causing bowel gas, flatulence, bloating etc. This will also cause you to retain water in the intestine, causing diarrhea., Most Crohn’s disease patients experience repeated bouts of diarrhea, making them prone to dehydration. From this, many patients develop kidney stones due to concentrated urine. Dehydration also makes you weak and lethargic. A simple way to assess whether you have dehydration is the feeling of thirst. Drink at least 2–3 liters (0.5–0.8 US gal) of water daily to prevent dehydration. Sports drinks that provide electrolytes can also help replenish your system after a bout of diarrhea.

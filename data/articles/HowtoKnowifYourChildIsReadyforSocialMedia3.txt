 It is important that you are familiar with the social media accounts that your child uses or is interested in using. Create your own account and explore its features, privacy settings, and interface. Knowing how to use a social media platform and understanding the types of interactions it cultivates will help you decide what is appropriate for your child., When your child or teen creates an Instagram, Snapchat, or Twitter account, let them know that you would like to add them to your network. You will be able to monitor their activity and see that their friends and followers are people they know in real life., If your child can only be online in the evening, make sure that you only access your social media sites during that time, too. If you encourage your child to post updates about their interests, avoid posting selfies to your own account. Your child will notice what you post online, and they will notice when you are scrolling through your Facebook feed on your phone. Adhere to your own rules to be a role model for your child., Reach out to other parents and ask them how they talk to their children about online safety, security, and social media use. They may have tips, suggestions, or advice about what to do when your child asks for a social media account.

Next time you are catching up with a friend or relative, ask how they talk about social media in their family. “Sarah asked to sign up for Instagram the other day, and I’m not sure that she is ready. How did you talk to your kids about social media?”

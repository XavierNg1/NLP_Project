 Though you may want to have a baby despite your husband’s wishes, you should never skip birth control so you accidentally get pregnant. This type of behavior can lead to a lot of problems in your relationship, and further convince your husband not to have a baby.Lying about your birth control or manipulating your husband can lead to trust issues. The risk of getting pregnant is not worth potentially serious problems in your marriage.
 If you want to have a baby, you need to discuss it with your husband. However, try not to bring it up every second of every day. Nagging your husband about the baby is going to accomplish nothing but pushing him farther away from the idea.If your husband is resistant, leave it alone for a bit, then return to it later.
 Pressuring your husband for a baby won’t make anyone happy. Obsessing about wanting a baby when your husband doesn’t may lead to resentment or feelings of pressure that may lead him to never wanting a baby. Instead, focus on the family you have at the moment.Having a good, strong family now may convince your husband that he wants to expand it in the future.
If you already have one kid, enjoy the child you have. Let your husband enjoy that child. He may eventually decide he wants to add to the family.
If you don’t have children yet, having a strong marriage and being happy may lead him to wanting to expand the family.

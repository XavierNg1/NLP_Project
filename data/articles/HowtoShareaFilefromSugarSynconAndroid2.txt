 Locate the SugarSync app. It’s the app with a green hummingbird. Tap on it to launch it.


If you don’t have SugarSync yet, you can download it on Google Play. Launch the Google Play Store and search for SugarSync there. From the list of results, select the correct app and tap the “Install” button.
 Tap the “Log In” button found at the bottom of the screen. You will be brought to the login screen. Enter your email address, or SugarSync username, and password then tap the “Log In” button to continue.


After signing in, you will see all your computers and devices where SugarSync is running.
 Tap on the name of the device where the folder you want to share is located. Browse through the folders until you find the folder you want to share.
 This will bring out its context menu.
 You will be brought to the Share screen.
 You will be taken to a page where you can add recipients and set their access levels.
 These people will need SugarSync accounts in order to join your shared folder.
 You can add a custom or personal message to welcome the recipients and give them a background of your folder.


This is optional.
 Tap on the Permission drop-down field to set the access level of your recipients to this shared folder. You can set it to Read Only or Add & Edit.


If you set the access to Read Only, your recipients can only see your folder and download its contents.
If you set the access to Add & Edit, they will be able to manage the files similar to how you do.
 An email will be sent to your recipients inviting them to join your shared folder.

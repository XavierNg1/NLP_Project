 If you aren't in a driveway or garage, turn on your hazard lights.;
, Make sure this wheel will not roll. If it's a rear wheel, set the parking brake. If it's a front wheel on a front wheel drive car, be sure the car is in park (automatic transmission) or in first gear (manual transmission). If the car is standard (manual transmission).
 Once it is removed, place the hubcap in your trunk so it doesn't get scratched up.
 Only loosen each nut about a quarter turn. Continue until you've loosened each lug nut.
 An older car may just use the frame, a newer car will have two notches or tabs on the seam below the door that the factory jack will fit into. Place the jack in place and raise the car slowly. Make sure the car doesn't try to roll away as the wheel comes off the ground.
 The new wheel may be bigger in diameter than the old flat wheel. You need enough room for the new tire to fit.
, Make sure you have a firm grip so it doesn't roll away. Take the spare tire out of the trunk, and put the old tire in the trunk.
, Make sure the rounded end of the nut goes towards the wheel or your wheel will be loose. The nuts should go most of the way in by hand. Take your lug wrench and tighten them as much as you can with the wheel in the air. You're going to tighten them again later, but you don't want the wheel moving around on the studs.
, Tighten your lug nuts with your lug wrench (clockwise to tighten). They should be very tight. If you're a small to medium build person, I would say they should be as tight as you can get them. If you're a body builder, just don't break the studs.
,, Be sure it is on securely and evenly. If you are not comfortable that the hubcap is secure, remove it and have someone help you at a later time.

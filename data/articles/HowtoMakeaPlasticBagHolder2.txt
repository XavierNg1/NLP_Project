 If you use a lot of bags, consider using a 15 by 24-inch (38.1 by 60.96-centimeter) piece of fabric instead., Fold the edges over by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) first, and press them with an iron. Fold them over by ½ inch (1.27-centimeters) and press them flat with an iron once more.If you are using a longer piece of fabric, fold and press the narrower edges.
 Take a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) piece of ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) wide ribbon, and fold it in half. Find the center of one of your hems, and pin the ribbon in place. Make sure that the bottom/raw edges of the ribbon are aligned with the bottom edge of the hem. This will make a loop on the top of your bag holder so that you can hang it., Sew as close to the inner folded edge as you can, so that you can slide the elastic through. When you reach the ribbon, be sure to sew right over it.Sew ⅛ to ¼-inch (0.32 to 0.64-centimeter) away from the inner edge of the hem to ensure that your elastic will fit.
 Cut two pieces of 7-inch (17.78-centimeter) long, ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) wide elastic. Use a safety pin to pull the elastic through the top hem. Pin both ends of the elastic to both openings of the hem; the hem will scrunch up on the elastic. When you are done, repeat this step with the other elastic for the bottom hem., Make sure that the raw edges of the fabric square are aligned, and that the hems are on the top and bottom. Secure the edges with more pins.
 Backstitch across the openings of the hems and the ends of the elastic a few times for extra security.If your fabric has a tendency to fray, finish the raw edge with a zigzag stitch.
Remove the sewing pins as you sew.
Trim off any loose threads for a neater finish.
 Use the little ribbon loop to hang it on a hook. Fill the bag with plastic bags. Pull the plastic bags out through the bottom.

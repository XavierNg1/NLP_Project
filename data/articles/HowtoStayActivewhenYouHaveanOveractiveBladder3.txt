 An overactive bladder is not an unfortunate side effect of aging. It is a symptom, not a disease, and should be seen by a doctor. Overactive bladders may be due to medication or diet. Treatments are available for overactive bladders.If an overactive bladder has started interfering with your everyday life, you should make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible. You may then be referred to a specialist.
Say to your doctor, "I am having some bladder problems. I have the urge to urinate often, and it interferes with my life" or "I have minor leakage from my bladder. This keeps me from doing things or going out."

, When you go to the doctor, your doctor can give you medication to help with an overactive bladder. These medications control or relax the contractions of your bladder. Talk to your doctor about whether medication is right for you.


For males, overactive bladder problems may be caused by the prostate. Your doctor may prescribe medication that helps shrink the prostate.
 Kegel exercises help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. This can help protect from leakage and reduce the urge to urinate. To complete Kegel exercises, you should tighten your pelvic floor muscles and hold them for 10 seconds. Do 10 to 20 reps five times each day.To find the right muscles, stop your urine in midstream. Those are your pelvic floor muscles.
When you get the “urge to go” feeling, squeeze and relax these muscles as quickly as possible. This sends a message to your brain. Do this several times. As your bladder stops squeezing and begins to relax, the feeling of needing to urinate should lessen.

 When choosing classes, be sure to consult with your guidance counselor, or adviser, and check your degree program’s listing of required classes to ensure that you take all of the classes you need to obtain the degree you want.
 Your courses will be available through your college’s software system, where you will be able to view assignments, take non-proctored quizzes and tests, email your professors, and communicate with other class members. Once you have successfully completed all of the required courses, contact the student affairs office or your adviser for instructions on applying to graduate.

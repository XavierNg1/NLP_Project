 Trim any fat off the steaks and snip the edges at regular intervals to prevent the meat curling as it cooks.
 Place the lamb on a grill pan and cook it under a pre-heated grill for 8 minutes on one side until it's brown. Turn it over and cook for 5 minutes on the other side., Meanwhile, mix 100g of mozzarella cheese with 50g of chopped ham, 25g of chopped sun-dried tomatoes, 6 sliced black olives and a few sprigs of rosemary., When the steaks are cooked, divide the mixture between them, easing it to the sides. Grill them for a further 5 minutes until the topping is melted and golden brown.

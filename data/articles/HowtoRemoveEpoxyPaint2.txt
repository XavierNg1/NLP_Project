 When using chemical strippers, particularly methylene chloride, the air in the room must circulate and change 7 to 10 times every hour. As you are working, place a fan behind you so the vapors are pushed away from you. Point the fan toward an open window, or opt to work outdoors.The chemicals in some paint strippers are considered carcinogens, and being exposed to high concentrations in a short period of time can cause confusion, headache, lightheadedness, nausea, and vomiting.Keep the air circulating, and limit your exposure.

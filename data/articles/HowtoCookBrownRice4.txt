 Add 3 cups of water and 1 tablespoon of oil to a 2.5 quart microwave-safe dish with a lid. Crumble 2 chicken bullion cubes into the water (optional).
 Measure out 1 cup of brown rice. Rinse thoroughly in a sieve until the water runs clear. Sprinkle the rice into the water-filled dish and give it a small stir to combine.
 Place the dish in the microwave and cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes on high power. Then cover the dish, without stirring the rice, then cook for 30 minutes on 50% power.
 Leave the microwave door closed and let the dish sit in it for 10 minutes. Then remove the dish from the microwave and fluff the rice with a fork. Serve.

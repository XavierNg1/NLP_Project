 Take your scarf and fold it in its middle point to double it. Grab both loose ends and thread them through the section formed by the fold. Slip your head into this loop. Pull on the loose ends to tighten and pull on the looped section to loosen.
 Lay the scarf over one shoulder. Pull one end of the scarf to gather lots of slack. Take this end of the scarf and coil it loosely in a coil around your neck. Continue coiling until you only have a little slack left. Let the loose end of the scarf hang down over your other shoulder. Pull the loose ends to tighten and pull on the coil to loosen.
 Grab the scarf by both ends and press your neck into the middle point. Wrap one end in a complete circle around your neck, keeping it fairly tight against your skin. Repeat with the other end if you have enough slack. Let both loose ends hang down over your torso. Pull the loose ends to tighten and pull on the tight wrapped section to loosen.
 An infinity scarf is a loose loop of material meant to be worn around the neck. Unlike a normal scarf, it's not made from a long, skinny strip, but a single continuous loop. You can loosely drape it around your neck or double it up several times for a much tighter "tie" â€” it's up to you!

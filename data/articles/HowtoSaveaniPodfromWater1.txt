 If the iPod was not completely submerged, be careful not to let water get into any of the port openings.;
, If your iPod was on when it got wet and remains on, that’s a good sign! It means that the device hasn’t short-circuited yet. Hold the power button and power your iPod down as soon as possible. This can help avoid damage.
 This will help it dry out faster.
 Use a towel or paper towel to dry your iPod. Gently shake your iPod to remove any water in the ports.


Be sure to dry any cracks and crevices you can reach. You can use the rolled corner of a paper towel to get into hard-to-reach spaces.
 You want enough rice to completely cover your iPod. Uncooked rice is good at absorbing moisture and is too large to get stuck in the openings for your headphones and other cables.


Other absorbent materials like the silica gel packs that come in shoe boxes can also do the trick.
 The amount of time can vary, but you want to make sure that your iPod is completely dry before powering it back on. Give it a few days if you want to be really sure.
 If it successfully turns on, then rejoice!


It is also possible that your iPod lost charge while you were waiting. You can connect the device to a power source and check for the charging symbol after a few moments.

Clean the giblets out and rinse the bird, inside and out, under cool water.
Pat it dry.
Brush butter or olive oil all over the bird and cover with your favorite seasonings. Include the inside of the bird and under the skin as well, if desired.
Cover the bottom of the crock pot with water or broth or sliced vegetables to help keep the turkey from sticking or burning and also to add flavor.
Place the turkey into the crock pot and cook on high for 1 hour.
Reduce the crock pot setting to low and cook for another 8 to 10 hours.;
, It is important not to overcook the bird since the white meat becomes dry when overcooked.

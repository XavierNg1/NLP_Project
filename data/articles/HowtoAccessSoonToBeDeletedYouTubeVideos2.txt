 Type YouTube's web address (YouTube.com) into your browser. For now, don't enter anything in the search bar.
 The "About" button is a link at the very bottom of the YouTube homepage. You will have to scroll down to find it on the far left of the bottom of the page.


Sometimes the homepage will load more videos after you scroll: keep scrolling until you reach the very bottom.
 Now in the "About" page, the first option in the right column will be the link entitled "Community Guidelines."

, If you scroll down a little, you will see a section entitled "Don't cross the line." Under this section is listed the kinds of content that is policed among the YouTube community. If you are looking for material that is likely to be deleted soon, using some of these keywords will be the easiest way to find it.
 Scroll to the top of the current page ("Community Guidelines") and enter the keywords of the content you wish to view.
 Right below and to the left of the search bar is the "Filters" button (you won't need to scroll down to see it). Once you click on it, several options will appear in a kind of little window.
 In the far-right column, under the title "Sort by Relevance," is the "Upload Date" filter.
 The videos you now see in your search results are the ones that have most recently been added to YouTube. These videos may or may not soon be deleted. However, if any of these violates YouTube's Terms of Use, YouTube will delete it within the first 24 hours of its posting -- if not much sooner (due, again, to its vigilant monitoring and algorithms).

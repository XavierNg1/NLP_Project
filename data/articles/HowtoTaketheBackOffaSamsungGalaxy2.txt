 If you have an external case on your Samsung Galaxy, you'll need to remove it before proceeding.
 To do so, you'll hold down the Lock button, tap Power off in the pop-up menu, and tap POWER OFF (or, in some cases, OK) when prompted to confirm your choice.









You run the risk of short-circuiting your phone or shocking yourself if you take the back cover off while the phone is on.
 This is to avoid scratching the screen while you remove the back cover.


For example, you might place a towel on a table.
 Depending on your phone model, this slot's location will vary slightly:










S4 and S5 - Top-left corner of the back cover.

S2 and S3 - Top of the back cover.

S - Bottom of the back cover.
 You can also use a small flathead screwdriver, a guitar pick, or a similarly slim object as long as you do so gently.
 It should come away from the phone's body.
 Once you have a firm grasp on the case, you'll pull it away from the phone's body, thereby exposing the battery and SIM card.









Be sure to store the back of the case in a warm, dry space so that you don't damage the phone's internals when you put it back on the phone.

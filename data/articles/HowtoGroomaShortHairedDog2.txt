 Some shorthaired dogs may be scared of the bath. Fortunately, you can help your dog experience positive bath time associations by performing a few simple actions.Start by placing your dog in the bathtub without water. You can do this several times prior to an actual bath.
Bathe them in less water. Work up to pouring water over them.
Offer your dog a treat whenever you bathe them!

, Unless they are very dirty, shorthaired dogs only need to be bathed around once per month. Bathing your dog much more than this can remove oils from their coat and create skin irritation., Just like people, dogs are sensitive to water temperature. They like it to be warm, but not too hot. Fill a tub (or sink if your dog is small) with lukewarm water. You want the water to come up no higher than your dog’s belly.
 Distribute a dollop of shampoo into your hands and work this into a lather. (The amount you use will vary by the size of your dog.) Then apply this to your dog’s back, chest, and top of their head. If your dog tends to squirm in the bath, ask a friend to help you to keep your dog stable and calm.Use only dog shampoo for this purpose.
Look for a product formulated for shorthair dogs.
 Using a detachable shower head or bucket, gently pour water over your dog’s fur to remove shampoo. Run your hands over your dog to help rinse them. Repeat this until the water runs clear.Wait to rinse the top of your dog’s head last.
Avoid getting soap in your dog’s ears or eyes.
 Using a fluffy towel, remove your dog from the tub and dry them off. Your dog will probably want to “shake” to remove some of the water. If your dog doesn’t mind, you can also use a hair dryer on a low setting.

 There are many that can be found on the Internet. Just do a search for “GIMP Brushes”. Both dedicated sites like GIMPbrush.com and artist sites such as DeviantArt feature GIMP brushes. GIMP brushes end in the extensions “.gbr”, “.gih”, or “.vbr”. Simple brushes for other programs, such as Photoshop, also often work for GIMP by simply changing the file extension to “.gbr”. Note that recent versions of GIMP will actually convert Photoshop brushes automatically. The more complex the brush, the less likely it is to be convertible to GIMP. Procedural brushes, which change shape depending on how they are used, generally can’t be converted.;
, The proper place for this is in your personal “Brushes” folder, generally found at “C:\Documents and Settings\myusername\.gimp-2.6\brushes”. The exact filename will vary according to the version of GIMP you are using. There is a general brushes folder that is not separated by user, but GIMP advises that you do not edit that folder in any way.
 This is a button near the bottom right of the brushes display that shows two arrows, each pointing at the beginning of the other. This should cause GIMP to detect and display your brushes.

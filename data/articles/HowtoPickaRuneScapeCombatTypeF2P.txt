As you start, the best combat type is mage, since at low levels you can hit the hardest with it.
 You could also be a hybrid.
 Train to 40 attack, and 60 strength as well as 25/31 prayer.


This is great if you fight in larger teams, or want to train outside of the wilderness. At this level you will find many large teams to fight with.



Range is ideal when fighting in small groups at the low level.
Mage.Becoming a mage becomes unimportant once you get to 42 combat. Until you reach 70 combat, there is no need to use mage, so picking another combat style is recommended.
Becoming a Range/2h pure is ideal for true Pkers especially soloers. Raise 40 Attack, 70 Strength and 70 Range for ideal results, with prayer as an optional stat.

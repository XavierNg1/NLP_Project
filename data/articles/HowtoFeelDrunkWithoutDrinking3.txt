 Feeling drunk can definitely affect your mood. Some of these changes are positive, and some you would probably rather avoid. Alcohol causes chemical reactions in the brain, and these reactions can also be caused by other activities. That is why you might be able to feel the effects of drinking without ever taking a sip. Some changes in your mood might include an increased feeling of happiness, giddiness, or excitement. Alternatively, your mood might grow darker, and you could experience feelings of loneliness or anxiety., The feeling of being drunk can cause people to start acting differently. When the chemicals in your brain are having new reactions, it is reasonable to expect some changes in your behavior. For example, when you feel drunk you might become more social and talkative. These side effects are likely because you feel a little more relaxed and confident. In other cases, you might become withdrawn and even a little angry., When you feel like you've been drinking, you will likely notice some changes in how you physically feel. You might start feeling sleepy or groggy, as if you really want to fall asleep. Dizziness is something else that people regularly experience while they're drunk. Your vision could blur, and you could find yourself having some trouble balancing when you try to walk. People usually also have much slower physical reactions when they're feeling drunk., People like to feel a buzz because it feels new and interesting. It can feel exciting, the same as trying any new experience. Experimenting with these new feelings and effects can be really fun, as long as you are careful. Just make sure to know your limits and be aware of your surroundings when you're trying to capture a buzz.

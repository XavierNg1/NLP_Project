 Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland in your brain. The pineal actively converts serotonin to melatonin when it is dark, but when light is present it does not do so, and the melatonin oxidizes back into serotonin.


Consult with your physician about taking melatonin. Taking in the melatonin pills is a natural way to induce sleep, especially if you are physically tired at night but are still unable to fall asleep. However keep in mind melatonin is a hormone (like estrogen or testosterone) and just because it is natural does not necessarily mean harmless.
 These are safe when taken "without extra ingredients"—–i.e. no pain relievers, decongestant, expectorant, etc., but only for a night or two, as tolerance to them quickly builds.They are not recommended as a long-term, ongoing solution––merely as a way to "kick start" you back into a good routine of regular bedtimes, relaxation techniques and managing stress.


Read the labels. Try half or less of the usual dose so that you don’t end up with a "sleeping pill hangover," which will only make your sleep situation worse.
Be lying down in bed when your drowsiness kicks in.
If you use prescription drugs, advise with your doctor before taking anything else. Never thoughtlessly mix medications: with the wrong combination, you could end up mixing medications the way that will do you harm.
Be sure not to abuse any sedative. Do not take those in more than the prescribed dosage, neither beyond the recommended duration.
 Some of the most common sleep disorders are insomnia, narcolepsy and parasomnias. If you are indeed suffering from and are diagnosed with any of these conditions, your doctor will recommend treatment accordingly.

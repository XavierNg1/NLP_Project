 Buy a bag of dried apple chips and measure out about 1 cup (240 mL). Alternatively, make them yourself from any sweet apple variety (most reds will work):


Slice the apple into thin slices of uniform thickness.
Place the slices on a cooling rack. (If you only have a baking tray, flip the slices over halfway through baking to dry out the other side.)
Bake at minimum temperature (~250ºF/120ºC) with the oven door slightly open.
Remove when apple slices are wrinkled and mostly dry, about 2 hours.
Let cool to room temperature. The slices should become mostly crisp.
 You can pop the kernels on the stovetop (see above) or use a microwave bag. Use non-flavored popcorn, since butter will go on later.
 Melt ¼ cup (55g) butter and 2 tbsp (25g) brown sugar over medium heat, stirring frequently. You can stop as soon as both ingredients are melted, or keep cooking another couple minutes for a thicker caramel sauce.


You may use white sugar instead. The brown sugar adds a stronger caramel flavor and works with the apple pie spices.
 Pour the butter-sugar mixture into the bowl. Add 1 tsp (5 mL) cinnamon, ¼ tsp (1 mL) nutmeg, and ¼ tsp (1 mL) vanilla extract. Stir together well, pour over the popcorn. Give the butter a few minutes to cool down before eating.


Optionally, add a cup (240 mL) of chopped pecans or walnuts as well.

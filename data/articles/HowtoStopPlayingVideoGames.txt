, Then cut off an hour everyday. This sort of progressive reduction will help your body adjust.
 Once you start playing in a day you will continue have that urge to play more. If at weekends, don't play early morning once you woke up from sleep. Some people feel some sort of urge to play once they wake up (typical addiction) but it's very much easier to control yourself before playing than after (even playing 30 minutes affects you). If at weekdays, do the important things that benefits you before playing when you come home. All in all, play late at the day when you are satisfied with your production through your day., What are the alternative things you could be doing? This might be improving your studying, learning a new hobby, seeing friends more often, spending more time with your family and/or pets, going out more, taking up a sport, etc.
 You should be strict all the same, as cutting down requires removing the desire to play. Play for only a couple of hours on weekends, after you've finished your chores and the other things you want to do.

 If you feel like you really really must play, channel your playing energy into a sports activity.
 Things you should avoid include "May I please play 5 more minutes", "I need to finish this up or it won't save", and "I'm in the middle of something". Video games are no longer the highlight of the day. You have better things you would rather do, like reading, a sport, or another activity that is healthy for your mind and body.

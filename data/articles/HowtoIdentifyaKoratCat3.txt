 Korats tend to weigh six to 10 pounds (2.7 to 4.5 kilograms). To weigh the cat you are trying to identify, place it on a scale, then check the readout., Korat cats grow slowly. Some don’t reach their full size until they are five years old. If the cat you wish to identify is taking a long time to grow, it might be a Korat., Your veterinarian can help you determine whether you’ve got a Korat by taking a DNA sample. Generally, this is as easy as swabbing the inside of your cat’s cheek or, in some cases, drawing its blood. Your vet will inform you of the exact process and any preparations you need to make before bringing your cat for its DNA test.

Be up front and honest so your agent can sell your home truthfully. For example, if your basement floods during periods of heavy rain or your roof leaks, your agent needs this information.;
, Many states have 1 specific form that sellers must use to disclosure any defects when selling property.


Ask your agent for the disclosure form, or get it from your state department of real estate or city planning department.
 It is illegal and fraudulent to conceal any known defects.
 While not all states require an inspection before the disclosure is made, it is a good idea to have one completed.


Use the inspection report for purposes other than the disclosure. It can help you set the price of your home before you put it on the market, and might help you decide which repairs to make before you sell.
 Always lean towards disclosing, even if you are in doubt about whether it is necessary. This will protect you legally and demonstrate your honesty to potential buyers.


Remember that disclosing a problem does not require you to fix it.

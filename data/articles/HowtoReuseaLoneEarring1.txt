 However, care must be taken to choose an earring that looks good on its own, so it might not be the best choice if the earring is tiny or doesn't dangle; if the earring is long and sweeps onto your shoulder, then you're good to go.It might be possible to build on your existing lone earring to make it longer and bigger; for example, you could add a hoop, feathers, a delicate chain, etc.

Another fashion idea is to make a new pair from two odd earrings for a unique set. This requires care to match size and like type though, to avoid it being too quirky. Think flower earring with another flower earring or a sapphire earring with a diamond earring.;

 Write down every name that comes into your mind when thinking about your fish. Keep going until you have a nice size list of names to choose from.Don’t worry about writing down names you think are silly. When you brainstorm you want to write down everything that comes to mind.
Try using the betta’s color with a noun to create a name. For example, a name like “Red Fighter”, “Blue Swimmer”, “Green Monster”, or “Yellow Angel” might work.
 Go through your list of names, and say each one out loud to your fish. Try using each name in a sentence talking about your fish. See how it makes you feel when you call your fish by each name.


Notice if your fish makes a reaction to one of the names by swimming towards you or doing something different.
 If you are stuck trying to brainstorm a name, try getting help from others. Invite people over to meet your new fish and ask them what they would name it, or show your list to your friends and family to see which name they think is best.You can also post a picture or video of your fish on social media and ask people what the name should be.
It might help to research some commonly used names for fish like Bubbles, Finney, Sushi, or Stripes.

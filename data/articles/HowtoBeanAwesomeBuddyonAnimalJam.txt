 Go to Jamaa Township or Coral Canyons and say,"I need a BFF." Hopefully, someone will add you, because they will be sympathetic that you need or have no buddies.;
, Maybe say, "Hi, I'm Darling (whatever your avatar's name is) can you be my buddy please? The jammer should reply his/her avatar name and greet you with a friendly smile. I suggest you smile back or 'shake paws'.
 Invite them to your den and talk. (Remember not to give out personal information. Even though they are your Animal Jam friends, you don't know them in real life. Don't talk to strangers!)

, Play games with your buddy or throw a buddy party at your den. Most jammers love to play Rock, Paper, Scissors and Four Gem. Jam on!

, Don't get lost with your buddy! Maybe invite your buddy to the Jam On party and dance, go shopping together for matching outfits, or maybe get adopted together as siblings.
 Send your buddies some gifts when you have time - you could get something back! Getting to know each others' wishes will help you on their birthday. Say your buddy loves rare hats... on their special day, send them a rare jester hat, or maybe a rare top hat. Your buddy will have a big smile.
 Make sure when you leave Animal Jam, say goodbye to your buddy! Say "Whoops! I have to go, I'm very sorry. I'll see you tomorrow evening!" And log out.

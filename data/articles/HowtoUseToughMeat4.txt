 Freezing helps to tenderize meat because in the process of freezing, the sharp crystal created from the freezing water contained in the meat severs collagen fibers.
 For example, when freezing, add a marinade to act during the period the meat will be frozen. Include fruits with meats, especially pork that uses fruits such as apples, peaches or plums to create a truly delicious meal.Include citrus with birds such as chicken , pheasant and duck. Try using oranges (remove the rind) with duck and lemon or lime with chicken. Tangerine with pheasant is delightful.

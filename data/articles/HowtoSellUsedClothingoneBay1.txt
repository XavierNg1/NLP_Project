 You’ll need to choose items that are in good enough shape to sell, and ones you won’t mind letting go of. It can be easy to get stuck at the stage of choosing which clothes you can do without. A good approach is to separate the clothes you wear frequently from the clothes you aren’t wearing and continually pass up when choosing an outfit.The odds are good that you won’t regret selling anything that has been gathering dust in your closet, and that you won’t wear these neglected items again.;
, It might not be worthwhile to try selling items that have a low resale value. To get an idea of what an item of clothing could be worth, do a search from the eBay homepage. Your search terms should include at least the brand name, size, and style of clothing.


Clothing brands that tend to sell well and at a good price include J. Crew, Victoria’s Secret, Bebe, Columbia, Tahari, Banana Republic, Under Armour, Miss Me Jeans, Theory, Lululemon,River Island, Zara, Topshop, Miss Selfridge,Claiborne, Patagonia, Tory Burch, Michael Stars, Hudson Jeans, and Rachel Roy.
 Some of your choices might also be too damaged to be attractive to buyers. For the more valuable items, a small hole or tear that could easily be repaired is ok. But long rips, big holes, stains, or major discoloration tend to make the item difficult to sell. Shoes should have all eyelets intact, no stains or tears to the material, and a sole that is not visibly worn down.
 Put each item you plan to sell through the wash or have them dry cleaned. In addition to being eBay’s policy,washing gets your clothes in the most presentable shape for being photographed. Some cotton items may be ironed as well--wrinkly clothing can put off potential buyers.


You’ll need to dry clean certain delicate fabrics, such as silk and suede. Check the item’s tag for specific cleaning instructions, and look out for the “dry clean only” phrase.

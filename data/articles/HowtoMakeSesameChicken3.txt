 Mix the honey, garlic, soy sauce and sesame seeds together in a bowl. Set the sauce aside for now.
 In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until foamy, then add the corn starch, mixing well to ensure that there are no lumps. Add the chicken to the corn starch mixture and toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper.
 Heat one tablespoon of oil in a large non-stick skillet over a medium-high heat. Add half the chicken to the pan and cook, turning occasionally, for about 6 to 8 minutes. The chicken should be golden brown on the outside and white through the middle. Transfer the cooked chicken to a plate to drain, the repeat the process with the remaining chicken and oil.
 Once all of the chicken has cooked, return it to the skillet and pour over the reserved sauce and chopped scallions. Toss everything together, making sure the chicken pieces are evenly covered in sauce.
 Steam the broccoli in a steamer basket over a medium-high heat for about 6 minutes. You want it to be slightly crisp, rather than too soft.
 Serve the sesame chicken and steamed broccoli over a bed of brown rice.

 Some people are closer to their friends then they are to their family. If you realize you are closer to your best friend than you are to a family member, they may be the right person to walk you down the aisle.You may even ask two close friends to accompany you down the aisle, especially if you are torn between two close friends and do not want to have to chose.
 There may be a close friend of the family who has been in your life since childhood or during a pivotal time in your life, such as a good friend of your father’s or your mother’s. Perhaps your family has always been close with a next door neighbor or a business associate. You may decide to ask this family friend to walk you down the aisle to honor their contribution to your life and to help you honor your union with your partner., One fun option is to include your family pet by having them accompany you down the aisle at your wedding. You may enlist a pet you and your family own or a pet you and your partner own together. Having a pet accompany you can be a unique and interesting addition to your wedding.If you do end up enlisting a pet to walk you down the aisle, you should make sure you practice the walk with them several times so they are prepared on the day of the wedding.
 For a non-conventional approach, you may decide to walk down the aisle alone. This approach can be a way for you to express your independence and try a non-traditional way to run your wedding. You may also feel more comfortable walking down the aisle alone than with family or a friend.You and your partner may also decide to forgo the walk down the aisle tradition to family or a friend and walk down the aisle together. This can be a way for you to feel connected and part of a pair at your wedding from the very start of the ceremony.

 Fill a large saucepan approximately halfway with water. Next, place a glass bowl in the pan to create a double boiler.
 When you’ve set up the double boiler, add ¼ cup (50 g) of coconut oil and 2 tablespoons (28 g) of beeswax to the bowl. Place the pan on the burner, and heat on medium-low until the ingredients melt completely, which should take approximately 5 minutes.


The mixture will melt more quickly if you use beeswax pellets rather than a block of beeswax.
Stir the mixture periodically as it’s melting to ensure that the coconut oil and beeswax combine completely.
 Once the coconut oil and beeswax have melted, remove the pan from the heat. Stir the mixture again so it’s smooth. Next, stir in ⅛ cup (30 ml) of olive oil and whisk the ingredients until they are creamy but you can still pour them.


If you want to give your “Vaseline” a pleasant scent, you can whisk in two to three drops of tea tree, peppermint, or another essential oil.
 When you’ve finished whisking the “Vaseline” mixture, carefully pour it into a glass jar or container with a lid. Let the “Vaseline” cool for two to three hours so it has time to solidify before you start using it.


The homemade “Vaseline” will stay fresh at room temperature for up to a year.

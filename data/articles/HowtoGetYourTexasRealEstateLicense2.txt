 It will take around 10 to 14 business days for the TREC to approve your materials and allow you to take the exam. During this time, it is highly recommended that you take an exam prep course. These are offered in person or online. They are refresher courses that help you review everything you learned in class for the exam.Exam prep classes also give you a detailed idea of what to expect for the exam, which can help you go into the exam less nervous.
You also may be given practice exams. Take as many practice exams as are offered before taking your exam.
 Once TREC has approved your materials, you can sign up online through their website to take the exam. The website will help you locate a testing center in your area. There is a $54 fee to take the exam.If you run into trouble signing up and have questions, you can call TREC at 800-997-1248.
 You need to take your exam within one year of having been approved to do so by TREC. At least 70% is required to pass. The exam's questions are divided into a national (80 questions) and state section (30 sections). You have 105 minutes for the national portion and 45 minutes for the state portion.Testing centers usually have rules about what can and cannot be brought into the testing room. Make sure you ask about rules when you enter the testing center.
 You have three chances to retake the exam if you don't pass. You have to wait 24 hours to reschedule your test. After failing three times, you will have to repeat training before taking the test again.If you failed the test, don't panic. Many people fail the first time. Make sure you do not take it right again immediately. Give yourself another couple of weeks to study before taking the test again.

 M-Lab is an open platform designed to enhance internet transparency. It has several tests available for both average and sophisticated internet users.;
,, Tests include:


Network Path & Application Diagnostics will diagnose the most common causes of all performance problems on wide-area network paths.
Network Diagnostic Tool will test your connection speed and receive sophisticated diagnoses of problems limiting speed. This is a good option if you’d like detailed trouble reports sent to your network administrator.
Glasnost will test whether certain applications or traffic are being blocked or throttled on your broadband connection. Currently, you can test if your ISP is throttling or blocking email, HTTP or SSH transfer, Flash video, and peer-to-peer apps including BitTorrent, eMule and Gnutella.
Pathload2 will see how much bandwidth your connection provides. The available bandwidth is the maximum bit rate you can send to a network link before it gets congested.
ShaperProbe will determine whether an ISP is performing traffic shaping by dropping your access rate after you’ve downloaded or uploaded a certain number of bytes.
WindRider will detect whether your mobile broadband provider is prioritizing or slowing traffic to certain websites, applications, or content.
 Note that some of the tests are hosted on third-party websites.

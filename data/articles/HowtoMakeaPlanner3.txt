 Endpapers act as separators for the actual planner. These are pages that are typically laminated or coated with strong plastic. Endpapers also protect the planner pages from being damaged.It is also common to decorate these pages in a similar theme as you did for your planner’s cover.
 They can be mounted onto your customized endpapers. Construct a pocket by cutting half a page of thick paper. Then staple the edges around the end paper. Create a couple of pockets in case of an emergency.
 Binder tabs are helpful for organizing and accessing papers by subject or month. You can find binder tabs in an office supplies store.They contain tabs that allow you to insert a written subject like “Fieldwork” or “January.” Cut the height and width of the tab pages if needed. The tab pages should be the same size as your planner pages.


Hole punch the tabs once cut to the proper dimension. Do not cut the edge where the tabs are overlapping.
Use tabs to separate the months so you can access the month and date quickly.
 Sometimes it is nice to have a quick fact sheet to use on the spot in your planner. You can find or create a reference sheet of a relevant subject and include it into your planner. Reference sheets are helpful for storing mathematical/scientific formulas, historical timelines, or even verb conjugation.Your reference page should be in the beginning of your planner.

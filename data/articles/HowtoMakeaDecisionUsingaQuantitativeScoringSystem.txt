 Our example will be "Which mortgage professional should I choose?";
, For example:


Integrity (What he/she says is consistent with what he/she does),
Professional Knowledge and Expertise (Makes Recommendations consistent with what I value),
Quality of Communication (Helps me understand quickly),
Accessibility (I can reach them when I need them),
Competitive Pricing (Rates and Costs are amongst the best in the marketplace), and
Reliability of recommendations (Shows me that live market data is consistent with recommendations so I can make a timely decision to choose them).
 (If reliability is far more important than anything, it gets a 10, if Competitive Pricing is the second most important but really not nearly as important as reliability you might give it a 5 or 6, and so on.)

, (Bank Loan Officer, Realtor Referred, my current Loan Broker, etc.).
 (If your current Loan Broker rates are good with you, give them an 8, but if you think they are average, give them a 5.) This is a subjective scale, so itâ€™s up to you to score it as honestly as possible to make the best decision by the end of this process.
 (For example, your Loan Broker scores 56 in Integrity: 8 x 7 ).
 Compute a separate score for each option.
, The option with the highest score (compared to your target) is your best choice.

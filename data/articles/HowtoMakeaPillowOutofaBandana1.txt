 You will need two 22-inch (55.88-centimeter) bandanas.They can be the same color and pattern or different ones. Play around with different combinations, but make sure that they look nice together.;
, Place the first bandana down, right side up. Place the second bandana on top, right side down. Make sure that the edges and corners match up, then pin them together using sewing pins.


If you want the hems visible as part of the design, pin the bandanas with the wrong sides facing in.
 Use a sewing machine and a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) seam allowance to sew along the top and both of the side edges. Sew along only half of the bottom edge.


Be sure to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing.
You do not need to serge or finish the inside hems.
 Use something pointy, but blunt, like a pencil or knitting needle to help push out the corners. If you are leaving the hems on the outside, skip this step.
 A pillow form will work the best, but you can use an old throw pillow as well. You can also fill the pillowcase with polyester stuffing instead., You can do this by hand using a ladder stitch.If you left the hems on the outside, you can carefully topstitch the opening shut instead, but be careful not to catch the pillow inside!

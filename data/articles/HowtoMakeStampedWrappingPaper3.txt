 You can often find them in the print-making section of an arts and crafts store. They are usually a light pink color and relatively thin. They are often labeled as "carving blocks.", Unless you have carved stamps before, it would be a good idea to keep the design simple.
 Leave the areas that you want to be "colored" blank. When you carve your stamp out, the raised areas will the parts that get stamped against your paper., These stamps look a little bit like wood carving tools, except that they are much smaller, and the metal part is curved. They are often labeled as "linoleum cutters.", Carve the design out a little bit at a time using a scooping motion. You don't have to carve very deep or evenly; keep in mind that any raised areas will pick up ink and show up on your paper.
 Choose some brown or white craft paper or butcher paper. Cut it down to the size you want, then spread it out on your work surface. Tape or weigh down the corners.
 You can also use paint meant for print making, tempera paint, or acrylic paint.
 Keep pressing the stamp until the paper is filled. Remember to re-ink your stamp when the design starts to look faded.
 Use the paper to wrap gifts. It works especially well for handmade gifts because it will give them that final, special touch.

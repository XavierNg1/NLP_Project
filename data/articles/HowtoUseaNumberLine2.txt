 Determine which number is first in the problem and which is second.


For example, in 5 + 3, the first number is 5 and the second number is 3.
 Put your finger there.


This is where you will start counting.
For example if your math problem is 5 + 3, you should put your finger on 5 on your number line.
 You have now moved 1 space.


If you start at 5, when you reach 6, you have moved 1 space.
 This will make sure you end on the answer to your problem.


Don't move more spaces than the second number in your addition problem.
For example, if the second number in your problem is 3, you will move 3 spaces.
 That is the answer to your math problem.


For example, if your math problem was 5 + 3, you would have moved 3 spaces to the right of 5. Your finger would be on 8 on your number line. 5 + 3 = 8.
 This will help you make sure you have the right answer to your math problem.


If you come up with a different answer during your check, try again to double check.

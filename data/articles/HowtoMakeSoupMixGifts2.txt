 Use 1/2 a teaspoon (1.13 grams) of each ingredient and add it to the bottom of your soup mix.These powdered spices will add flavor to the soup. Do not use the fresh variations for these spices unless you plan on gifting your soup mix within a day.


Use one quart (.95 liter) mason jars.
If you do use fresh spices, make sure to keep your soup mix refrigerated.
 Add one tsp (7.80 g) of dried chopped onions and dried minced garlic to your mason jar. These final ingredients will add additional complexity and flavor profiles to your chicken noodle soup. Make sure to use the dry spices and not fresh ones or else your soup mix will be perishable.
 Dump wide egg noodles on top of the other ingredients. You can also swap the egg noodles for vegetable noodles, elbows, or a different type of noodle. Thick egg noodles will help soak up some of the broth better than thinner noodles.
 Add a 1/2 teaspoon (1.13 grams) of celery seeds and one or two chicken bouillon cubes to the mix. The chicken bouillon cube will transform your dull water into a broth. You can replace your chicken bouillon cube with beef or vegetable cubes to create beef or vegetable soup, respectively.Unwrap the bullion cube so that your gift receiver can just dump the ingredients into a pot.
 To make the chicken noodle soup, heat one tablespoon (5 mL) of oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add a diced carrot or another vegetable of your choice and cook it for five minutes. Once it's hot, add the ingredients from your mason jar and three cups (709.76 mL) of water to your pot. The soup should take about 10 minutes to cook fully.

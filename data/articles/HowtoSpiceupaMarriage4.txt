 Your spouse's body, personality, goals and dreams are going to change over the years, just like you are changing. Married couples need to accept each other as they change and mature, rather than struggling to hold on to youth that is no longer there.


Don't see your spouse's changing body as being full of flaws. Our culture views aging as something to resist, but this is a backwards view. Changing skin and hair can be beautiful in their own right. Be glad you and your spouse get to grow old together!
Be flexible enough to accept your spouse's changing personality, too. People tend to get a little harder as they age, but they also get wiser. Help your spouse mature into a happy, whole, fulfilled person by being flexible and accepting.
 Remember when you took your marriage vows? You never could have imagined all you'd go through together as a couple. Look how far you've come, and how much you've accomplished, and be grateful for it. Expressing your gratefulness to your partner will re-energize your marriage and help you look forward to a long future together.
 Don't compare your spouse to his or her former self, and don't compare your marriage to its early stages. Life is full of changes, and that's a good thing. Wishing things were as they used to be isn't going to help your marriage to grow. And would you really want it to remain stunted forever, anyway? You can enjoy talking about memories and looking at old pictures, but try not to get overly wistful and nostalgic. Focus on the here and now, and planning for the future.

 This will be the main part of your water feature. A wide opening is important here. , You'll need 3/4" diameter bamboo cut long enough to fit over the opening of your pot. You'll also need a larger ~2" diameter piece of bamboo, cut to about 6" in length. Miter one end of this piece to create the spout.
 Using twine or string, lace the three narrow pieces of bamboo together into a platform which can be fit over the back half of the pot. Attach the larger piece of bamboo to the platform using glue, but attach it at an angle (using a wedge) so that the spout is angled down towards the center of the pot slightly.
 Place the pump at the bottom of the pot. Connect the tube and run it up and behind the platform. Place the end of the tube in the bamboo spout so that it goes about 2" in, and then tape the tube in place against the pot (not anywhere that will get wet).
 Add water into the pot and then start your pump. Everything should be working. Now you just have to make it pretty!

, Fill the bottom of the pot with river rocks and add some fake plants around the spout to cover up evidence of the pumps. Enjoy your new fountain!

 Instead of depositing cash in a bank, purchase a reloadable prepaid debit card. This card works the same way a regular debit or credit card does, and allows you to make purchases up to the amount deposited on the card.The process by which you deposit cash onto the card depends on the terms of the card. Some cards allow customers to deposit cash at the checkout register of certain big box stores. Cards that were obtained at banks usually require you to add more money to the card at the issuing bank.
Before purchasing a reloadable prepaid debit card, ask the issuer how to deposit cash onto the card. If you find the process too difficult, consider another option for depositing cash.
Reloadable prepaid debit cards are available online, at big box stores, and at many banks.
 Automated teller machines (ATMs) are machines that distribute and, in some cases, receive cash so that you can access your bank account even when the bank is closed. Banks that are not linked to ATMs that allow deposits will not be able to accept cash deposits.Find a bank with access to a large ATM network. To find an online bank with a large ATM network, contact several banks and ask the bank representative, “Do you offer access to a large ATM network?” If the answer is “No,” look for another way to deposit your cash.
Most online banks do not accept cash deposits via ATM.
Cash deposited through an ATM might be put on hold for several days.
 While many banks – both traditional and online – allow you to deposit checks by mail, you should never send cash by mail. Most banks disallow this, but even if you encounter a bank that does, do not deposit money in this manner. The risk of your money getting lost is too great. Convert your money to a money order instead.

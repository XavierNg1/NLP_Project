 A 1 liter (0.3 US gal) bottle is a good height and weight for hanging. Wash it to remove all traces of the original drink and allow to dry thoroughly. You'll also need two wooden spoons or similar wooden items (dowels, spatulas, etc. will all suffice). These can be old, used ones, or new from the bargain store.;
, Use a marker to mark the spots after measuring:


Measure the first hole from the base of the bottle to about 4 inches/10cm up. Draw an asterisk measuring about 1/2 inch. Then turn the bottle around 90 degrees.
Measure the second hole from base about 2 inches/5cm from the bottom. Mark this spot with another 1/2 inch asterisk.
Draw a 1 inch/2.5cm circle just next to the asterisk on each side of the bottle.
 Cut the asterisks along the asterisk lines only, then cut out the circle rounds precisely.


Use a craft knife; this has greater precision than scissors and is easier to handle when cutting the bottle.
 Repeat in the opposite direction for the other wooden spoon. Both spoons should now sit snugly in the bottle. These form both perches for the birds and feeder holders for the seed.
 This provides the hanger for the bottle feeder. Thread either wire or twine through the eye and tie firmly. Ensure that you use enough to hang from somewhere such as a tree branch or a pole.
 Return the cap and screw it on tightly.
 This might be a tree branch, a washing line, a post or pole, or some other improvised item. Make any adjustments needed to ensure that it hangs in a balanced way and wiggle to allow a little of the seed to fall into the spoon holder. This should continue to fill on its own from the weight of the birds landing on the "perches".

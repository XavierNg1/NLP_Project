 Here, users submit their own definitions and pictures for various words. Many of the definitions submitted aren't that good, but the most relevant definitions are listed first. Users can "thumbs up/down" for each word according to the definition.;
, It's likely you will find a web page with definitions for a number of slang words, the one you want might be on the list. If it's not, try another engine. Repeat until you've found it.
 Turn to family members, friends, employees/employers, teachers, anyone. They might have a definition for you. If you have any, check with brothers or sisters, they should probably know all the words.
 Sometimes slang words evolve from a word or pair of words. For example, the slang word "gonna" is often said in place of "going to".
 Look through the web, in books, in movies, etc. for the word you are looking for being said. Once you have heard it used in a few different ways, it should be easier to understand. This definitely worked, since this is how you learned to talk. Over time, you learned that certain words meant certain things (e.g.: someone said cookie when they gave you a cookie).

Try not to husk the corn at the grocery store. Most retailers set up large trash bins for you to husk the corn and take it away with its kernels exposed. Unless you are going to boil it as soon as you get home, keep the corn in its husk.
 There might be several layers to take off. You can discard these or add them to your compost pile if you have a garden.










Wipe down the corn with a damp paper towel. This will help you remove the silk, which can be time consuming and frustrating because they are so thin and determined to cling to the corn.

 Another easy way to make ramen in the microwave is to boil water separately and add it to the noodles, letting them steep. If you like your noodles slightly more firm, this is an excellent way to cook them in the microwave.









Depending on how much broth you want, anywhere between 1 and 1/3 cup and 2 cups is fine. Less will boil faster, but you want to make sure you have enough to make as much broth as you want.
 Because of the way microwaves agitate water atoms, you won't see the water boiling consistently and steaming heavily like you will when you boil water on the stove. Sometimes, it hardly looks hot at all. Aim for a few runs of 2 or 3 minutes through the microwave, stirring quickly in between.









When you're confident the water is hot, pull it out carefully with gloves or an oven mit.
 While the water is microwaving, remove the noodles from the package and put them in a separate bowl. You can add the seasoning packet now if you want to, or save it until after the noodles cook some.
 When you've got your water hot, pour it over the noodles, cover the bowl with a paper towel, plate, or lid, and let the noodles sit for between 3 and 5 minutes, until the noodles are soft and delicious. Then enjoy!









The instructions on the Cup 'O Noodles or Instant Lunch are somewhat vague in regard to the microwave. While the jury's somewhat silent on how dangerous it really is to microwave Styrofoam, it's probably better to heat the water separately and add it to the cup afterward, rather than risking making melted plastic for lunch. Yuck.

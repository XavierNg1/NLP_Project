 You can access this from the App Drawer or by opening the Notification Bar and tapping the Settings button.;
, You may have to tap "More..." or "More settings..." to see this option.
 This will enable the wireless hotspot functionality on the Note.


In order to use this feature, your cellular plan must support tethering and hotspots. Not all cellular plans support this. If your plan does not support mobile hotspots, you will receive a message informing you how to add the feature to your mobile plan. If you need to share your internet with another device but your plan doesn't support it, click here.
You will also need to have a cellular data signal, which is indicated by the "3G" or "4G" icon in your Notification Bar. Your Note will be disconnected from any wireless networks when acting as a hotspot.
 This will open a new window that allows you to change the name that is displayed when people see your hotspot, as well as the password required.


Don't include any personal information in the name (SSID).
Make sure that the password is strong so that unauthorized users cannot access the hotspot.
 Now that your Note is broadcasting a wireless signal, you can connect your other devices to it.Open the wireless network list on the device that you want to connect to the hotspot.
Select the name you set for the wireless network and enter the password.
After a moment, the device will be connected to the internet.
 When you have multiple devices connected to the hotspot, they can eat through your data quite quickly. This is especially a concern when laptops are connected that are visiting the desktop versions of websites, which aren't optimized to conserve data.Open the "Data Usage" section of the Settings menu.
Use the slider to set a limit on how much data can be used.

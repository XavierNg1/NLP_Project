 On the day of the MRI, be sure that your child is not wearing anything metal. This could be jewelry, belts, hair clips, electronic devices, or zippers on clothing. Be sure they are dressed in comfy clothes and free from all metal objects., If your doctor will be using a contrast dye in your childâ€™s MRI (via IV) your child may be required to refrain from eating or drinking for several hours prior to the test. The doctor will provide details about this.Make sure your child eats something before the fast period begins.
If they are hungry during the fasting period, you can try to distract them.
You might play eat pretend food with a small child, or engage an older child in conversation.
 In most instances, parents will be asked to step into an adjacent room during the MRI. This room should have windows, allowing you to watch the process. In some cases, parents may be allowed to stay in the MRI room. After the procedure is over, your child should be able to head home. If you child was given a sedative, they will still be sleepy for a few hours. Otherwise, they should be able to resume normal activities right away.Prior to the procedure, you can show your child where you will be.
Even if you must be in an adjacent room, you can explain to your child that you will be nearby and watching the whole time.

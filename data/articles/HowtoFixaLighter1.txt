 If you broke the plastic part of your lighter then you'll need a new one. The pressure is compromised and you won't be able to use it anymore.;
, If you've left a lighter outside for a long period of time the metal wheel on top might be rusted in place. If it won't spin, it won't light. If there is only dirt and debris inside the lighter you might be able to clean it out with your fingers or a pipe cleaner and get it going again. , Luckily the most common problem with these lighters is their incredibly small fuel tank. When this no longer holds enough fuel or enough pressure, it needs to be refilled. The most prone to mechanical and/or internal failure would be the non-reusable Bic lighters.
 If there is no spark, that means that there is no flint. The flint is the piece of equipment that the wheel rubs against to create a spark. The spark lights the fuel and gives you a flame, so the flint is extremely important.
 If the flame burns out then you could be running out of fuel. However, if you just recently bought the lighter there might be an issue with the fuel reaching the spark.

 Make sure you know where everything is. Also make your room comfortable. Add some seating, decorations, and personalize it with what you want. A comfortable room relaxes a lot of people.;
, A lot of teenage girls like to make themselves look nice. You can look for makeup tricks, do your hair, and dress with whatever style you want. This makes allot of girls feel very relaxed and happy. When looking for clothes, try to stay in the comfortable, but fashionable looks. That will make you so happy!

, Try to keep your mind off of mean people, money, or any other concerns that may worry you. Worry will only lead to a high strung and grumpy girl.
 Take time to lay down, relax, and smile. Realize how good your life is and all the calming details. And don't go around asking for more when you know you have so much fun already.
 Try to avoid the people who you argue with or might even dislike. Take time to enjoy your family and friends. Go shopping with the girls, spend time with your boyfriend, or stay home with your loving family.
 Even if people think what you like isn't cool, do it. It's your life, don't let other people ruin it!

, It's true-you can't please everyone! The only person you need to please is yourself. If you like something, do it.
 Go out there and strut your stuff! Even if you don't like how you look on the outside, you have a great personality, and that makes you beautiful!

, Don't try to do things just because it is weird. Simple things actually relax people more than others.
 If you like computers, making videos, art, have fun with it. Be original and show the world your creativity.
 Make time to stay home and relax for a day.
 You don't need to be a twig. Unless you are overweight, it is OK to enjoy a little comfort food.

 Finding a gym is pretty easy if you live in a suburban or city area. Some key words to search for are, "Gym" and "the city you live in".
 This can be a little tricky, but if you spend time while driving in a car or before you go to sleep thinking about why you want to do gymnastics, simply present this to your parents, and hopefully they will give you the okay!, This will help determine your level. The gym may ask you questions like, "Have you done gymnastics before?" or "Did you used to compete gymnastics?" And they may ask questions about your skill level. This is all natural, and it will help place you in your correct level. Don't lie in answering these questions to sound better, as it will only hurt you when you start classes., First, make sure your hair is tied back and out of your face. To test this, if you can, do a handstand and if your hair gets in your face, you might want to consider another hairstyle. Next, wear a leotard, or if you don't own one, wear a shirt that won't fly up when flipping and shorts you can move in. Don't wear jean shorts or anything with buttons. Leggings, shorts, and tank tops are the best options if you don't have a leotard. Some great places to buy these are lululemon, ivivva, target, GK, Plum Practice Wear, Alpha Factor, etc., Bring a water bottle, and don't rely on them having a water fountain there. It will also allow you to bring water to the apparatus around the gym., You don't want to be late on your first class and it will allow you to talk and befriend some girls in the class before you start.

 Your bottom should be flat on the floor or exercise mat, and your legs should be sticking straight out. Lean your upper body back slightly.


If you lack the strength to hold your upper body back, you can prop yourself up by leaning back on your elbows.
If you have a stronger core and do not need to lean on your elbows, cross your arms over your chest.
This exercise does target your abdomen and may help reduce muffin top by building abdominal muscles.
 Your legs should be lifted just high enough to engage your abdominal muscles without straining them.
Before lifting your legs, make sure that your chest and back are held tall. Tighten your core or abdominal muscles.
 Keep your toes pointed out and move your feet back and forth over one another.


Move your feet in quick, small, and precise gestures.
You may need to play around with the height of your feet in order to get the most benefit from the exercise. The closer your feet are to the ground, the more strenuous the movement will be. The higher up your feet are, the easier it will be. You need to choose a height that forces your abdominal muscles to work without causing pain.
 Each back-and-forth motion should be considered one repetition, and you should aim to do 20 or 30 repetitions per set.

Try to get three to five sets in during your exercise routine. Increase the amount or speed as you progress.

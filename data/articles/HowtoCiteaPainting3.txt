 For a reference-page citation, use the artist’s last name first, followed by a comma and his or her first name: “Lukas, Joe.”

, Follow it with a comma and then write down the year that the painting was created, followed by another comma. For example:


“Lukas, Joe. Lovely Flowers, 2011,”

, After the name of the museum, write down where the museum is located. Include the city and the state. Alphabetize your reference page by the artist’s last name.


“Lukas, Joe. Lovely Flowers, 2011, The Museum of Flora and Fauna, Topeka, Kansas.”

, For an in-text citation, insert a footnote at the end of the sentence you want to cite. It will create a superscript number with a corresponding number at the bottom of the page. Click in the footnote to start typing. Your in-text citation will look very similar to your reference page citation:


“Joe Lukas, Lovely Flowers, 2011, The Museum of Flora and Fauna, Topeka, Kansas.” Basically, you switch the name around and use a comma after it instead of a period.

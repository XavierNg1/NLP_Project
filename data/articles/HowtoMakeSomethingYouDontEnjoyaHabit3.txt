 Identify a habit or behavior you do regularly and use it to trigger your new habit. Building your new habit onto an existing workflow of behaviors or habits will increase your odds of success.For example, if you wake up at seven o’clock each morning and brush your teeth, try beginning your new workout or meditation practice immediately after brushing your teeth.
 Making something you don’t enjoy into a regular habit is not an endeavor that will happen overnight. While some experts say it takes as little as twenty-one days to form a new habit, other studies have shown it can take sixty-six days or longer. How long it takes you to form a new habit will depend on your unique situation, personality, and environment., When making something that is potentially unpleasant into a new habit, it’s very easy to fall off the bandwagon. In fact, more likely than not, you will slip up or engage in old habits that circumvent your new ones. When this happens, be gentle with yourself and try not to be discouraged. Tomorrow is a new day, which brings with it another opportunity to make your new habit stick.If you do slip up, try making a list of why you decided to adopt your new habit and all the positive steps you’ve made toward your goals so far.
 Making something you don’t enjoy into a habit is hard work! Make sure you take the time and energy to reward yourself for tiny successes. Self-reinforcement will help you maintain your new habit and even learn to enjoy it!

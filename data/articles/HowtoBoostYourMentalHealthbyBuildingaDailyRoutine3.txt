 Adding a walk into your daily routine can reduce stress and even eliminate depression. It also allows you to get some fresh air and work off extra weight, which is also good for your health.


Research shows that walking 200 minutes a week, which works out to less than 30 minutes a day, can be just as effective against depression as medication. Even if you’re not depressed, walking every day can still have a positive effect on your mental health., Being tired is one of the biggest obstacles when it comes to exercise. Combat this by working out when you feel most awake. You’ll reap more benefits this way and be more inclined to stick with it.


Exercise during your lunch break if you feel most awake mid-day. Going for a brisk walk or doing some jumping jacks and push-ups each day during your break can do a great deal for your mindset., Cardio isn’t the only type of exercise that can boost your mental health. Workouts that build muscles can also do wonders for your mood. Doing a mixture of aerobic and muscle-building activities can reduce your risk of depression and help you rest better.


Engage in these types of exercises three to five days a week for 30 to 60 minutes to get the most out of these workouts., Adding small bursts of activity or finding ways to get a little more movement in can help you to get more exercise. For example, you can take the stairs instead of the elevator, park further away from the entrance at the grocery store, take a walk during your lunch break, or ride your bike to run errands instead of driving.

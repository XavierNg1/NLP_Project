 Fleas are very small insects. They do not have wings and are usually brownish or reddish in color. These insects have flat-shaped bodies with a mouth and sharp jaws. Their flat bodies enable them to move easily through an animal’s fur.Fleas have six legs equipped with hooks so that they can latch securely onto a host (such as your dog). While they don’t have wings, their strong legs enable them to jump long distances.
Adult fleas are generally 2.5 millimeters in length.;
, Fleas are common pests that attack furry and warm-blooded animals. These include cats, dogs, and other pets. A simple ocular inspection may tell you that your pet is infested with fleas.


A flea infested pet will constantly itch and scratch itself. This is because the flea’s saliva contains a protein that irritates your pets skin.
Look for red pimples or bumps on your pet’s skin. In most cases, these red pimples are evident under the legs, belly or groin of your pet. This may indicate that your pet is infested with fleas.
Do an ocular inspection. By simply having your pet lie on its back and inspecting their fur, you will be able to find fleas if there are any. Adult fleas are very small but visible to the naked eye.
 Even if your pet is not infested, there are other warm furry animals, like mice, that may share your living space. Some wildlife and pest animals may live in the crevices, nooks and crannies of your home. These animals may bring fleas into your place.


Some animals that may be infested with fleas are bats, rats, opossums, raccoons, and squirrels.
 There are places where fleas may reside such as beddings, pet areas, carpets, sofas and furniture.


Fleas can multiply very quickly. An adult female flea will lay eggs every single day while only having to mate once. Laid eggs can remain dormant for days and months until the environment is warm enough for them to hatch.

 The thoughts that we think soon turn into the words we say and the actions we take. Having good thoughts about yourself gives you self-confidence and self-respect: a hallmark of any good personality. Once you become aware of your own thoughts the process of guiding them in the right direction through positive thoughts will become effortless.
 We often come across opportunities in our day to day life to express our personality. Do it! Don’t try to fall in line with the crowd. Having a good personality doesn’t mean that you are like everyone else. For example, if you are in a conversation with a group or an individual, try not to just constantly agree with everything that they say. Insert your own opinions and stories in a respectful and engaging way.


Always act like yourself. People are drawn to others who act real. If you are putting on a front it will be easy to tell.
 It’s easy to get down on the parts of your personality that you need to work on. Try to avoid that. Pay attention to the parts of your personality that you think appeals to other people and try to showcase that.
 Maybe you think you talk about yourself too much, or that you become impatient too quickly. It’s important to recognize these things, but not to hate yourself for it. Try to pay attention to the way you are acting. The next time you start acting impatient you can catch yourself and try to respond differently to the situation.

 While there are 26 letters in written English, spoken English incorporates 44 distinct sounds. Learn the characters that represent each of these sounds. Then you will be able to write words phonetically, and study dictionaries that use these characters to “write out” the pronunciation of each word.RP English is the accent upon which phonemic transcriptions (the characters representing sounds) are based, so you’ll be at an advantage learning RP English over another form of spoken English – the characters will “spell out” the pronunciation of words in the way you’re trying to learn them.;
, Identify sounds or stress and intonation patterns that differ between your native language and RP English. Understanding these differences will show you which elements of RP you most need to work on. Learning some words will be a simple matter of adding vocabulary, while in other cases you’ll have to re-learn how to pronounce a specific sound, letter, or syllable., While much can be said about RP English, its most distinctive characteristics are clipped consonants and elongated vowels. The clipped consonants, in particular, are what give it the nickname “cut-glass.” Recognizing these basic traits will help you quickly distinguish RP English from regional accents or the increasingly prominent “Estuary English” once associated with southeastern Britain’s working class.

 The best come with a grid on the backing and allow you to reposition the paper if you make an error placing it on the sheets.
 Handle it by the edges so you don't leave fingerprints in the adhesive. If the backing has a grid, then save it to use as a guide when placing your document.
 Lay the sheet on your work surface adhesive side up with a grid under it. You can use the grid on the backing you just removed, a sheet of graph paper or a grid you drew on a plain sheet of paper. Tape the grid down so it doesn't slide around.
 With small documents on large laminating sheets, alignment isn't important. You may need to adjust the laminating sheet on the grid.
 Press the corner down with your finger.
 Smooth the paper your hand so that it lies flat with no wrinkles or air bubbles.
 Discard the backing.
 Start at 1 corner and smooth the sheet down a bit at a time to remove wrinkles and air bubbles. You can also use a tool called a brayer to smooth the sheet, or you can burnish it with the edge of a credit card.
 Leave a 1/16" (2 mm) border so that the laminate doesn't loosen.

 Most vets keep a supply of animal medications in the office. While acepromazine is available as an injection, your vet will probably sell you the tablets as these are easier to give your animal at home.


Vets may mark up the price of the tablets by charging a dispensing fee. They are generally a more expensive option for buying pet medications, although they are the most convenient option for many people. If you need acepromazine immediately for your dog, the vet may be the only place where you can get it., Some pharmacies carry medications for pets as well as for humans. Call your local pharmacy to see if they carry pet medications. They may be able to order acepromazine for you, even if they do not carry it. Your vet may also be able to call in the prescription for you., There are many large retailers and supermarkets that stock pet medications at their pharmacies. You might have luck checking if you can buy acepromazine from them. Some stores that stock pet medications include:


Target
Kroger
RiteAid
Walgreens

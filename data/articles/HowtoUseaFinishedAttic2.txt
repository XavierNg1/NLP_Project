 Put a large table in your attic so you have a place to play board games and card games. Include storage, like a shelf or stackable totes, so you can keep your games orderly when they’re not being played.Small tokens or dice can be lost easily. You might want to have a separate sealable container to keep these from getting lost.
Some lamps or adjustable lighting can help set the tone for your games. Spooky games, for example, would benefit from dim lighting.
 You’ll be able to enjoy hours of pleasant viewing with a large TV and some comfy seating in your attic. Hook up a sound system so you feel like you’re in the center of the action. Hang posters of your favorite shows and movies from the walls.If you have enough space, you might install a projector in your attic. A sheet or a flat, white wall can be used as the projection screen.
 Due to the angle most roofs have, attics usually form a unique space. A couch, some chairs, and a coffee table will make this a great place where you and guests can enjoy each other’s company.In this room, you might want to keep a power strip with an extra phone charger plugged into it so guests can conveniently recharge if necessary.
Family photos, pictures from a memorable vacation, coffee table books, art, and so on can work well as conversation pieces. Decorate your hang out space with items like these.
 Set out a playmat or a low table so your kids have a place to draw, play board games, and so on. Storage for games and toys often fits nicely in corners or under sloping sections of the attic.To prevent your kids from being careless with their electronics, create a docking station near a wall outlet for storing and charging tablets, handheld games, and electronic toys.

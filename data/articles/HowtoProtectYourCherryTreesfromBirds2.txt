 Before you buy your netting, make sure you can drape it over the tree. Trees more than 8 feet (2.4m) tall are impractical to cover. For trees near this height, use ladders and/or a device that can lift the netting on a tall pole, then drape it outward.
 You can buy bird netting, but ordinary garden fabric (row cover) will work as well.The mesh should be fine enough to avoid tangling the birds..A ¼ to ½" (6–12mm) mesh should work even for small birds.
 This part can be a pain, and requires at least two people for most trees. Wait until your cherries have formed, then cover the tree once you see them starting to take on green color. The netting will catch against the branches, so hold the netting flat above the tree and lower it. It should cover the entire tree, and hang fairly loosely, since cherries tight against the netting will still get eaten.


To protect fruit at the edges, plant stakes around the tree to lift it above the cherries. Top the stakes with upside down milk jugs, which won't tear the netting.Valuable or important fruit can be protected by a full frame around the tree., Birds can fly underneath the netting and get trapped. To prevent this, tie the base of the netting securely to the base of the tree with twine or hog rings.


You can also stake the netting down to the ground around the drip line of the tree.

 If you're standing on the outside of a block, a placed door will end up on — you guessed it — the outside of the wall. If you're standing on the inside of the block, a placed door will end up on the inside of the wall.
 Two adjacent doors will automatically orientate to become double doors.
 A pressure plate placed on either side of the door will automatically open and close the door as you pass through it. If you're worried about mobs, however, only place the pressure plate on the inside of the door to keep mobs out.


Wooden doors can also open and shut easily by right-clicking the door.
 It is impossible to open an iron door without a mechanism nearby. Use this knowledge to keep mobs and other griefers out of your private space.


Make a redstone pattern to your door and use a lever to open it.
Place a pressure plate on the inside hinge of your iron door to open.

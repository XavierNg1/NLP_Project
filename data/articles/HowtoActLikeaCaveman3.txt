 Whether you’ve made your own costume or bought one from the store, you need a new name to get into the prehistoric spirit! Go with something short, preferably one syllable, and that sounds kind of like a grunt.
 You’ve got the look down, but you’ve got to talk the talk. Stay in character: don't use words like I, you, or us, and try to avoid proper grammar. Talk in grunts and hand motions rather than complete sentences.
 Put your phone out of sight for this costume party. One moment you’re looking at your phone, and before you know it you’ll be flying planes and inventing the internet. Leave the picture taking and tagging for the more evolved party-goers: remember, you’re still making cave drawings and selfies won’t be around for ten thousand years!

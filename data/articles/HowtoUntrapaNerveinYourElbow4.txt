 Cubital tunnel syndrome can usually be managed with lifestyle changes and bracing, but you may need surgery for severe cases. Talk to your doctor about surgery if conservative measures don’t help after 6 weeks, or if your pinched nerve is causing damage or muscle weakness in your hand.Ask for a referral to an orthopedic surgeon, a surgeon who specializes in bones, muscles, and nerves., There are several possible surgeries you can have. Ask your surgeon to discuss the risks and benefits of each, and help you determine which is best for you:

Cubital tunnel release: this cuts the ligament that may be restricting your ulnar nerve.
Ulnar nerve anterior transposition: this moves the ulnar nerve from its place behind the elbow bone to in front of it, which prevents it from getting caught.
Medial epicondylectomy: this removes part of the bone that the ulnar nerve catches on.
If there is a tumor or cyst in your elbow that is rubbing on the nerve, surgery can remove it., After your surgery, you will probably wear a splint for a while – up to 3-6 weeks. Your doctor may send you to physical therapy. Talk to your doctor about when it’s safe for you to return to work and your other normal activities.

 Located southeast of Sloan, the Hidden Valley has four bunkers, one being the Brotherhood of Steel. If you decided to oust Elder McNamara in the quest “Still in the Dark,” Edgar Hardin will become the new Elder. When you ask Hardin if you can join the Brotherhood of Steel, he will mention that you need to do a heroic act in order to join. He will order you to kill the Van Graffs located in Silver Rush.
 Silver Rush is a store found within Freeside, which is beside the New Vegas Strip. You will pass by the Atomic Wrangler Casino on your way to the Silver Rush.
 Destroying the Van Graffs can be a difficult task for newer players. There are a few ways to take this challenge on.


If you kill Simon outside of the Silver Rush at the front door, you won’t have to give up your weapons when you enter the building. If you choose not to kill Simon, you can buy or steal energy weapons from inside the store.
During the quest “Birds of a Feather,” the fourth customer will attempt to blow up the Silver Rush. Allowing him into the store will result in killing all the Van Graffs inside except for Simon.
If you decide to barge your way into the store, expect a heavy firefight as there are over a dozen Van Graff troops inside. It is recommended that you are over the level of 20 and are wearing a full suit of armor, whether that is raider armor or just leather.
 Once you return to Hardin in the Hidden Valley Bunker and speak with him, he will reward you with a full suit of T-45d Power Armor, including the training as well as membership to the Brotherhood of Steel.

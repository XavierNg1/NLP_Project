 While it is important to recognize how anxious you feel about being separated from your child, you cannot let this anxiety take over your life. Instead try to think of the potential advantages of your child being away and how you can make the most of this time. For example:


You can take some time for yourself where you are able to do activities you enjoy and accomplish things without interruptions.
You can build a stronger relationship with your child. If you can successfully stay in touch with your child despite the distance, you may find that your relationship comes out stronger on the other side.






You can both get really good at planning and think of some unique and creative ways of staying in touch.;
, Distance can force you to develop greater trust in your child, make your child more trustworthy, and allow your child to learn how to trust other people aside from you.


While he's away, your child may have the opportunity to explore and learn new things. This is a good thing, especially if your child tends to be a little shy.






He can learn how to be more responsible, even with things as simple as doing his homework by himself.






He can also become more independent and learn how to make simple decisions on his own.

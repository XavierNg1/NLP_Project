 Babies love to be swaddled because it gives them a secure feeling. You want to swaddle your baby with a blanket just tight enough so that s/he cannot wriggle free from the blanket.


Know that swaddling is a controversial practice, especially if started after the child is several months old. In some studies, swaddling increased the chance of SIDS, or sudden infant death syndrome, significantly.In many societies, however, swaddling is a common practice. To ensure that your child is safe and sound during the night, make sure the your child sleeps on his or her back (instead of on their tummy) and try breastfeeding regularly., This approach uses the theory that sleeping is a skill that your baby can learn on his/her own, however, the pediatrician who coined the term has since recanted. Babies do not have the capacity to 'self-sooth'; in truth, a baby stops crying when it realizes that no one is going to help it; the baby has given up. This is a horrific form of neglect and is both psychologically and physically dangerous.
 Side and stomach positions can be helpful for holding a colic baby, but dangerous when the baby is sleeping.
 You can either find a white noise playlist simply by searching the Internet, buy a white noise machine, or run any household appliance that creates a steady sound.


Find out if your baby likes to hear any particular type of music. If s/he responds well to a certain genre, play it very softly as s/he falls asleep.
 You may need to take your child for a car or stroller ride, but rocking your baby in your arms can be just as effective.
 As your baby falls asleep, the pacifier will fall out of his/her mouth and can help him/her soothe himself/herself while falling asleep.

 Many schools will have you execute a front kick off a front stance. To perform a front stance, lean forward while bringing one of your legs forward and bend your front leg at a near 45ยบ angle. Straighten out your back leg. If done correctly, you should appearing to be leaning forward, and you should feel a slight stretch in your back leg muscles.


Naturally, this stance is mostly used in martial arts schools. In practical cases, such as defending yourself out on the streets, you will probably want to execute a front kick from a fighting stance.;
, This is called a chamber. To do a chest-level kick, bring your chamber up to your chest. To do a low-level kick , lift your leg and chamber it toward his or her knee.
 Strike your target using the ball of your foot or instep. The ball of your foot is located just underneath your big toe. Curl your toes back as you kick to ensure that you don't accidentally hit with your toes. If you want to kick with your instep, point your toes instead.
 Curl your leg back to the same location that you originally chambered your leg.



If you are performing "line drills" in a school, you may want to drop your front foot down to the front into a new front stance, so that you can execute the next kick with your other leg.

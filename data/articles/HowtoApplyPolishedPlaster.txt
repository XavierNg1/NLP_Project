 If it's a gypsum plastered wall, then use a fine filler to repair any blemishes and sand where necessary.


This step is vital, as a stucco venetian plaster is very thin and any imperfections in the wall will show through.

, Leave the primer 8 hours to dry before applying the first coat.
 Work in a random manner across the surface starting at one side/corner and then going across. Try to keep the first coat as flat as you can, but it doesn't have to be perfect. Ensure the whole area gets an even coating.
 This is very quick; an area of one square metre should take 10 seconds.
 Try for an even coating, but bear in mind now the patterns you put in with trowel will come through the last coat and give it some character.
 Once covered and the plaster is immediately starting to dry, trowel over the surface to take off any high spots of plaster.
,, Once the coat is on, give the surface a gentle troweling up to start creating a shine. If you feel the trowel is gripping then leave a short while for the plaster to harden a bit.
 The ideal time to do this depends on the surface and conditions, but usually within 1 hour of stuccoing. As you work, look across the surface and you will begin to see shine points all over. Continue this until satisfied with the finish.
 Follow the instructions of either product; normally, you'll want to trowel on any wax and brush/ roll on and lacquer. The lacquer is now finished, but once dried out, the wax can be rubbed with lambs wool to create an even higher shine.

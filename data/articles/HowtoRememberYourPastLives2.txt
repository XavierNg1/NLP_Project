 Sometimes, past life regression requires tools that we are unable to masterâ€”self-hypnosis, for example, can be very difficult. Certified hypnotherapists who specialize in past life regression have been trained in the necessary fields. Here's how you can expect them to direct you:


They may play music as they talk you into a relaxed state, making you feel safe, warm, and comfortable. Let yourself follow along, and find your inner calm.
Clear your mind of directed thought, and let whatever comes to you happen naturally.
Relax your muscles in your body, especially your neck and shoulders letting the tension release.
As you relax deeper, they may talk about the light, letting it flow through you, reaching into every part of your body, until it totally surrounds you.
Once you are prepared and totally relaxed, they will open the doors to your many past lives by guiding you back through time.
They'll encourage you to explore your memories, with as much detail as you recall.
They may take you back to the womb, and talk you through being reborn in a past life.
When you've discovered your past life, they will guide you through it, encouraging you to feel it as you remember it, only this time when you awake, you'll have full knowledge of your past.
When you're session draws to the close, the hypnotherapist will slowly bring your back to the present reality and your current life.
 You have just experienced your past life.

 Start>Search>For Files or Folders. If you have named your folders with enough detail, you should be able to locate them very quickly using the search capability that Windows includes by default. You don’t need any special program to install or learn, you use only what comes with Windows on your PC.
 You may wonder: Why not use the Pictures, Music or Video? This option will find specific files and not folders. We usually want to find the folders containing the pictures we want, so we need to search for folders.


A folder is an organization tool which allows you to store specific files together in one place.
There are many more files than folders in your computer. This will narrow your search.
 Make sure you select My Pictures (or your pictures folder) in the “Look in” field. Otherwise it will search your entire computer. In the “all or part of the file name” field enter the event or place you’re looking for. If you have named your picture folders properly you should be able to find them quickly.


Enter something like: birthday, grandma, Yosemite, or other events or places of interest.
You can also enter part of a word (i.e. grand, yose, birth, and day) and the search utility will find what you’re looking for.

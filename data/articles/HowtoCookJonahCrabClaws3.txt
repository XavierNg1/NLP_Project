 Cover a rack on the grill with a layer of foil. Add another layer tight on top of it. You can cook the claws directly on the grill, but aluminum foil makes cooking easier. The foil corrals the legs and helps them cook evenly., You may be able to quickly cook the delicate claws without using spray. However, a non-stick cooking spray like Pam ensures that any crab parts you cook wonâ€™t stick. Spray a generous amount over the foil.
 This is optional since claw meat has such a strong taste. You can melt some butter and mix it with salt, Old Bay, garlic, or other seasonings to add a different flavor. Crack open the claws a little and pour the mixture onto the meat., Spread the claws evenly along the foil. The thick parts of the claw should be closest to the hottest part of your grill. You may also choose to grill a few claws at a time, avoiding the spot on your grill that gets hottest., Turn on your grill. Using a direct heat setting will cook the claws more rapidly. Get the grill hot enough so that your hand can linger over it for several seconds. Too much heat will overcook the claws, causing the meat to stick to the shell., The claws should cook through in five minutes or less. A whole crab can be cooked on the grill in under ten minutes, but Jonah claws are small and will cook faster than that. Watch for them to turn bright red.


To ensure they cook evenly, you may flip the claws over after the first minute or two of cooking. Use a long pair of tongs.

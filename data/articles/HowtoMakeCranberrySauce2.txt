 Empty a bag of cranberries into a colander, and rinse thoroughly, removing any leaves, stems etc.
 Heat the orange juice over medium heat in a medium-sized saucepan, and stir in the sugar to blend. Stir continuously, working around the edges to make sure all the sugar is dissolved.
 Stir and cook until the cranberries pop open. This will take around 5 to 12 minutes.
 Empty the cranberry sauce into a serving bowl, and allow to cool. If you want a completely chilled sauce, it will take about 2 and 1/2 hours in your refrigerator.

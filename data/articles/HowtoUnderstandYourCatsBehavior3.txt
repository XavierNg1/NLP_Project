 When cats live together they will naturally form some sort of a hierarchy. One cat may be dominant over another. The owner’s may not see this behavior and not understand why cats may have litterbox issues or other behavior issue at first. If watched closely, however, the dominant cat will display signs such as approaching the submissive cat with a stiff gait, erect ears, and elevating the base of the tail. The submissive cat, on the other hand, will look away, lower the ears, and frequently avoid the path of the dominant cat.Having a hierarchy is natural between cats. Just make sure that all of your cats are happy and healthy, no matter where they lay in the pecking order.
 Introducing a new kitten or adult cat to your current cat(s) can take some time. The resident cat or cats will probably see the newcomer as a threat, with much hissing, growling, and attempts at “running off” the intruder. This is normal behavior, but after carefully introductions and repeated exposures they should accept each other and may become good companions., Although cats are said to be solitary animals, they do form bonds with each other. When two cats become close and one is lost or dies, the remaining cat may be depressed for months. A depressed cat may meow constantly or stop eating. Lots of loving and comfort is needed in this case.

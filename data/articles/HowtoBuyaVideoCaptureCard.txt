 Are you using it to record camcorder video or video from a VHS? Or are you using it for video editing? Some can do what you're looking for, and others can do all of it, and possibly more!;
, External video capture cards can be plugged into your computer via a USB 2.0 cable. They're literally "plug-and-play" and require very little labor. Internal video capture cards require you to install the video card inside your computer, meaning you must open up the PC's case and install the card. While it requires more labor and more knowledge on computer parts, they are typically cheaper than external video capture cards, and have more advanced functions.
 Some cards capture only Firewire input (also called IEEE 1394 or i.LINK), while others only capture analog inputs, like RCA and S-Video. There are others that capture both Digital/Firewire and Analog.
 Some are better than others, so pay attention.

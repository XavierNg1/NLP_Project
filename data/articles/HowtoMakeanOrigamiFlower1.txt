 For this flower, you will need 2 6"x6" squares of origami paper and tape. One of these pieces of paper will form a stem, so you may want to choose a brown or green sheet. If you do not have 6x6 origami paper, then you can use a regular piece of paper. Make it into a triangle and cut the rest off and then you have your 6x6 piece of paper.






;
, Lie it on the table pattern or color side down. Fold the paper in half diagonally to form a large triangle. Fold the bottom left corner to the bottom right corner, making a smaller triangle. Reopen this smaller triangle.
 Take the left corner of the triangle and fold upwards from the center crease. This corner will extend beyond the edge of the original triangle and be at approximately the same height as the top corner. Repeat this fold on the right side. Try to make this fold symmetrical to the fold on the left side. Set the flower aside.
 Fold the paper in half diagonally. Unfold the paper and position it so it looks like a square diamond.
 Match the right edge of the paper to the center crease, making sure the bottom corner is also aligned. Repeat with the left corner. When you are done, your paper should look like a kite.
 Be sure the bottom point is precise and sharp. The seam in the middle should be tight.
 Repeat with the upper left corner. The seam between these two flaps should also be tight.
 Fold the left side over to the right side matching all of the edges. The shorter, fatter triangle forms the leaf.
 Take the leaf and gently pull it out and away from the stem.
 Cut a tiny piece of paper off the bottom of the flower. Stick the tip of the stem into the hole.









Tape the flower to the stem to prevent it from falling apart.

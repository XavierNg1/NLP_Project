 Buy one that suits you, one that really brings out your individuality. Not only will it look cool and show the real you, it will also protect your laptop! It can keep it from scratches, dents, and whatnot. A case is a great choice.;
, Get special laptop stickers that again, bring out your uniqueness. You need to choose wisely because you will not be able to take them off without ruining your laptop or making it sticky, unless it's a removable one.
 But this may be a difficult choice to get a hold of. Or, if you have a sharpie/permanent pen, you can sign your own name on it. Be careful as this could look slightly tacky if you don't do it right.
 Similar to stickers, but cover the whole of your laptop. Again, be careful when selecting since they can't come off afterward if you change your mind.

 This button has a down arrow on it similar to the down arrow to the right of dropdown lists and to the right of docked toolbars in Word 2003. This displays the "Customize Quick Access Toolbar" dropdown menu.
 The center pane displays 2 columns: the column on the left displays a list of available buttons, and the column on the right displays the buttons currently displayed.



To add a button or separator to the "Quick Access" toolbar, select it from the list on the left and click "Add."
To remove a button or separator from the "Quick Access" toolbar, select it from the list on the right and click "Remove."
To reposition a button on the "Quick Access" toolbar, select it from the list on the right and click the up arrow to move it up the list (and to the left on the toolbar) or the down arrow to move it down the list (and to the right on the toolbar).
To restore the default toolbar settings, click "Reset" in Word 2007, or click the "Reset Defaults" dropdown button and select "Reset Only Quick Access Toolbar" in Word 2010.

 You can buy any size spray bottle, or purchase multiple sizes. You can make a large bottle of perfume for your house, but you can also get a small spray bottle to keep in your purse.Make sure you get a spray cap where you push down, and not pull a trigger. These are much easier to apply perfume.
 You should usually purchase one large bottle, and organic vanilla tends to work the best. Getting a bottle of pure vanilla is important, because the perfume won't turn out well if the vanilla extract has sugar in it.If you're worried about the price, just remember: no matter how much you pay, it's going to be significantly less than the price of those expensive perfumes that everyone else buys!

, Different types of essential oils can be added to your vanilla perfume to create your own unique scent. You can buy small bottles of essential oils, and try them out to decide what you like best.Popular essential oils are rose, lavender, peppermint, chamomile and patchouli., Pour the essential oil of your choice into the spray bottle, and fill the remainder of the bottle's content with vanilla. If the spray bottle is large, then you can empty the entire essential oil bottle.If the spray bottle is smaller, fill it under half-way, and then top it off with vanilla.


Shake the spray bottle well before spritzing onto your skin or into the air. Some people spray the air in front of them and walk through it to use as a body-mist.

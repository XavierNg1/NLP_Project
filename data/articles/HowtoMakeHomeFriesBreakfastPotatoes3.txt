 Again, being careful not to spatter hot oil on your hands or arms. Wear a full oven mitt just in case or at least a long-sleeve shirt. Cover the entire bottom of the pan with potatoes but don’t pile them on too high.


If you are cooking a large quantity just cook more than one batch. The potatoes need to be mostly covered in oil.
If the oil is the right temperature the potatoes will boil and sizzle immediately when you put them in the pan. If this does not happen, carefully add heat until they are really frying, and note the temperature setting for next time.
 This is the perhaps the most enjoyable and also the trickiest part of making great home fries. A mixture of salt, rosemary, thyme and occasionally a pinch of lemon pepper make for a great recipe, but none of these are truly necessary. At least a sprinkle of salt is recommended.


As you add your spices, sprinkle them on the potatoes as you stir them to get decent coverage, being careful not to add too much salt or any other ingredient.
Salt and other seasonings can be added later, but like any recipe, they can never be taken out once they are in the mix.
 Keep watch to ensure they do not burn.


If you prefer crispier home fries, leave them on a little longer, but once they start to turn brown it doesn’t take long to burn them.
 Scoop the fully-cooked potatoes onto the paper towels to absorb any extra oil. They will be extremely hot at this point, so give them a minute or two to cool off before serving them.

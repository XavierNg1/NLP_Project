 If it is important to have a designer dress but you don't have thousands of dollars to spend, you can use an online service to find a gown that another bride only wore for 1 day.


Sites like Once Wed, Recycled Bride and Wore it Once create an online marketplace for people to buy and sell used wedding gowns. Some gowns were bought as a back up and have never been worn.
The site One Night Affair rents designer wedding gowns.

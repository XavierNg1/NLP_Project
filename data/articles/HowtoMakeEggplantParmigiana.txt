 Fry your chopped onion and garlic in a little olive oil, when soft add the tinned tomato and 1 tablespoon of the chopped mixed herbs. Season with salt and pepper and the 1 teaspoon sugar.

 Top with 1/3 of the sauce, 1/3rd chopped extra basil and 1/3rd of the cheeses. Add 1/3rd of the optional bechamel if you made it. Bechamel makes it creamier and slightly cheesier in flavour, but as some recipes have it and some don't its not a traditional "must have" ingredient.


You can do this in three main ways, firstly layer the eggplant as you would lasagne sheets to make even layers, secondly to build small columns of eggplant slices and thirdly to make a single layer with all slices on a 45 degree angle. The first method is the easiest, where the second and third methods are nicer for presentation. It doesn't really affect cooking time or flavour, so the method is very flexible.

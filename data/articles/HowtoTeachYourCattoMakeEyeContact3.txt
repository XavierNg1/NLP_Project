 If you do not feel like waiting around for your cat to look at you, you can "lure" them to look at you instead. Begin by selecting an object--such as a toy or treat--that is likely to attract your cat's attention., Present the lure object and try to get the cat's attention. You may need to move the object around a bit. This will work best when the cat is calm., Once your cat is locked in on the lure object, gradually move it closer to your face until they make eye contact with you. If you lose their attention, or if they do not look at your face, lower the lure and start the process again., When you successfully make eye contact with the cat, verbally praise them by saying "good job," and offer a treat. You can also begin adding a verbal cue, such as "watch," each time they look at you., Over time, begin hiding the lure object inside of your hand so that the cat cannot actually see it. Eventually, you should be able to attract the cat's attention by simply holding your hand in the same position, without using an actual treat or toy. This process is called "fading the lure." Continue to reward eye contact and use your verbal cue. Eventually, you should be able to compel eye contact from the cat simply by saying the word "watch."

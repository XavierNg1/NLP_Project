 Look for a brand of foundation specifically marketed as a body makeup for covering stretch marks, tattoos, scars, and/or blemishes. Find a body makeup that matches as closely as possible to your chest's skin tone. Because of clothing and the way sunlight hits the body, most people's chests are a few shades lighter than their faces and forearms.
 Make sure your skin is clean and dry. Massage in a little moisturizer. To make your makeup last longer, work some makeup primer into your skin. The primer will also help to smooth out your skin, reducing the appearance of stretch marks., You can use either either your fingers or a narrow makeup brush for more control. Blend well until the stretch marks fade into the surrounding skin.


If your stretch marks are particularly deep or dark, try adding some concealer over top of the body foundation.
 Use a wide brush or powder puff to gently dust on the powder. Use a clean brush to wipe off any excess. Setting powder helps to keep your makeup from rubbing off, something even more likely to occur with body makeup compared to face makeup.

 Because bluegrass guitarists must be able to quickly transition from lead lines to rhythmic playing, as evidenced briefly in the bass runs above, they tend to use similar sets of notes to make speedy play much easier. Use the notes from each chord currently being played to form your licks and solos. For example, the following lick in the key of C only uses those open notes and notes already in a C chord:


|e|----------------------------------------------------|
|B|------------------------------0---1---------------|
|G|---------------------0--2-------------------------|
|D|---------0--1--2---------------------------------|
|A|----3----------------------------------------------|
|E|----------------------------------------------------|, Instead of gently removing your finger from the fret, pull it downward, sounding out the string like your finger was a pick. Because bluegrass relies so much on open strings, this is a great way to quickly ring them out while picking other notes, effectively doubling your playing speed. Check out this simple run from a C to a G to see it in action -- the "p" means to pull off the first note into the second:


|e|---------------------3---|
|B|--------------------3--|
|G|--------------------0---|
|D|-------------------------|
|A|----3p2p0-------------|
|E|---------------3---------|

, A hammer on is when you slam your finger down on the fret so that it sounds out without picking. They are a great way to add subtle notes to your lead lines and solos and increase note speed. They also pair excellently with pull-offs, which can allow you to play three notes with only one strum. The "h" means you hammer onto the fret immediately after the "h":


|e|---------------------0----|
|B|--------------------1----|
|G|--------------------0----|
|D|----0h2p0--------2----|
|A|---------------3----------|
|E|--------------------------|

, A great way to increase your picking speed is to pick notes with your fretting hand. Hammer-ons and pull-offs are essential for bluegrass play, as they add speed and texture only possible with open notes, so don't be afraid to just start plucking and pulling off your chords to transition in and out of solos or create a little extra rhythm to your solos.
 For beginners, playing a lead line at a blistering 240BPM is a recipe for crashing and burning. A good way to get up to that pace is not to play as many different notes as you can, but to focus on playing a few notes well. You can keep your picking hand moving while keeping things simple on the fretboard, allowing you to play blazing fast lines with less effort. Try doubling or tripling up notes before you move, giving you a bit more time to think.


As you get better, you'll be able to start picking and fretting at faster and faster speeds -- just remember that it doesn't matter how fast a solo is if it sounds sloppy.
 Most solos, as evidenced above, tend to stick to the top of the guitar. But if you're really serious about lead guitar then you already want to stretch further down the neck into new territory. Luckily, the most common guitar scales -- the major and minor pentatonic scale -- will work wonders.A common, but difficult, skill is to change the scale to match the chord being played. So, for an A chord, you play the A-major pentatonic, then move to the C-major when switching to the C chord. This requires in-depth knowledge of every note on the fretboard.

If you're serious about bluegrass guitar, you must spend time learning the music theory behind the CAGED system, which helps map the fretboard.Still feel like stretching your musical muscles? Dive into the mixlodian mode for bluegrass solos as well.

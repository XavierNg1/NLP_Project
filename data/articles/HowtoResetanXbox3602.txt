 This button is in the center and looks like the Xbox logo. This will open the Guide menu.


If you are trying to bypass parental controls set by your parents, you won't be able to. Microsoft will require proof that you're authorized to change the parental control password.
 This will open the parental controls section.
 You'll be prompted to enter the current passcode.
 Since you don't know the passcode to access the Family menu, enter the wrong one so that you are prompted to reset the passcode.
 This will display the security question to reset the passcode.
 If you were the one that set up the passcode, answer your security question and you'll be able to create a new passcode. If you don't remember the answer to the passcode or a previous owner enabled parental controls, read on.
 If the previous owner had a passcode enabled and didn't remove it before selling it, or you don't remember the answer to your security question, you'll need to call Xbox Support to get a master reset passcode.


You can contact support at support.xbox.com, via online chat or telephone. You'll be asked some questions to verify that you are allowed to disable parental controls (Xbox Support won't disable parental controls if it was your parents that enabled them)., If Xbox Support approves your request to reset the parental controls, you'll be given a pass code you can use to bypass the current code. You can then disable parental controls or create a new pass code.

 The ACT, SAT, and other standardized tests are intense examinations and can be particularly stressful for graduating students applying for colleges and scholarships. If your score is lower than you hoped it would be, remind yourself that you can take the examination again. Simply retaking the test can improve test scores.If you take the test multiple times, most colleges will accept the higher score and some will even combine your scores., Your school’s guidance counselor is a great resource, and he or she can be key in working through college applications and standardized test scores. Talk to your guidance counselor about your test scores and discuss the requirements needed for the colleges you are interested in. Your counselor can offer advice, write a letter of recommendation, decide if your scores are sufficient for the school of your choice, and help you find resources for studying or retaking the test. Ask your guidance counselor to schedule a meeting. Let him or her know that you are particularly interested in discussing your scores and what that will mean for your college application. Be prepared to share your scores, the list of colleges you wish to attend, and prepare any questions you have in advance. Your counselor will also be able to provide information on schools and opportunities that may not take your scores into consideration.
 There are in-person and online review courses for most standardized tests. Be sure to review your options and consider which course would be best for your learning style.Becoming familiar with the test’s style, questions, and format will help boost your confidence and help you prepare to take the test again.

 Before you begin CPR, open the child's mouth and look for any objects that may have become dislodged. If you see something, remove it with your fingers., Next, open the child's airway by tilting their head back and their chin upward slightly. Check for breathing by placing your cheek next to the child's mouth.If they are breathing, you should either see their chest rising and falling slightly, hear breathing noises or feel their breath against your cheek.
Do not proceed with CPR if the child is breathing on their own., Pinch the child's nose and cover her mouth with your own. Give two rescue breaths, each lasting about a second. Make sure to pause between each breath to allow the air to come back out.


If the rescue breaths are working, you should see the child's chest inflate as you exhale.If their chest does not inflate, their windpipe is still blocked and you should return to the first aid procedures to dislodge the obstruction.
 Begin chest compressions by placing the heel of one hand on the child's breastbone, right between the nipples. Place the heel of your other hand on top and interlock your fingers. Position your body directly above your hands and begin compressions:


Each compression should be hard and fast, and should compress the child's chest by about 2 inches (5.1Â cm). Allow the chest to return to its normal position between each compression.Count each of the thirty compressions out loud, as this will help you keep track. They should be performed at a rate of 100 compressions per minute., Repeat the sequence of two rescue breaths followed by thirty chest compressions until the child starts breathing again or emergency services arrives.

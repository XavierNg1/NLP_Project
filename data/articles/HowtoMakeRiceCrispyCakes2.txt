 A double boiler is the best way to melt chocolate, since it lowers the risk of overcooking. If you don't have one, you can make it as follows:


Add a little water to a saucepan and bring to a simmer.
Cover the pan with a bowl. The bowl should be above the level of the water.
 Place 2Â½ cups (300 g) chocolate in the bowl and stir until melted. You can use any type of chocolate for this.


You can use a microwave instead, but this can cause burning or separating. Zap on the lowest power setting in 20-second bursts. Stir in between and repeat until melted.
 Put on oven mitts and remove the bowl from heat. Pour the chocolate over 6 cups (150 g) crispy rice cereal. Stir until the cereal is completely coated. Optionally, mix in candy, raisins, or other toppings.
 Spoon these into paper-lined cupcake tins, or directly onto a baking sheet covered in parchment paper.


Wax paper or grease-proof paper will work fine.
 Move the mini-cakes to the fridge for about 30 minutes, or until hard. You can eat immediately or keep them in the fridge another day or two.


Ingredients in chocolate sometimes "bloom" to the surface when cooked, moistened, or cooled. This creates harmless white blotches on the surface.

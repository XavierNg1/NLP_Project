 Routine vet visits are the best way to identify heart murmurs, as nearly all are detected at annual checkups or vaccination appointments. During a routine exam, the vet listens to a pet’s heart with a stethoscope. If they detect a murmur, they’ll let you know how significant it is and if it requires further testing.Heart murmurs in kittens often go away on their own. The vet will likely suggest a follow up visit after a few weeks.;
, If the vet detects a murmur, they’ll ask several questions about your cat’s overall health. Tell them if your cat takes any medications and if you’ve observed symptoms such as:Poor appetite
Weight loss
Lethargy or weakness
Difficulty breathing
Pale gums

, Not all heart murmurs are the same, and the vet will grade the murmur’s intensity on a scale of one to six. The vet will base their diagnosis on this grade, as well as the murmurs' duration, when they occur in the heart cycle, and the cat’s age. They'll either recommend imaging tests or let you know that the murmur is innocent, which is the term given to murmurs that don’t impact overall health.Imaging tests, like an x-ray or echocardiogram, will help the vet detect signs of heart disease or deformity.
Depending on test results, the vet might refer you to a veterinary cardiologist, or heart specialist., Heart murmurs can also indicate conditions like anemia and hyperthyroidism. The vet will likely recommend tests for these and other issues.An underlying medical issue, like hyperthyroidism, can often be treated with a good outlook and without complications. Treating hyperthyroidism usually resolves the related heart issue.

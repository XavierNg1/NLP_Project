 A makeup bag will work, but you can also buy another kind of box or pouch.;
, Sequins or rhinestones are easy to apply and you can put your name in fun patterns.
 Here is a list of things you should pick up from a local office supply store:


pens (black/blue and colored, ballpoint or gel-ink that won't run)






pencils (mechanical, so they don't stain the interior of the bag)






erasers (stick with the classics)






highlighters






white out/ correction tape






permanent markers (one black and one colored)

,, This is just in case you happen to run out.

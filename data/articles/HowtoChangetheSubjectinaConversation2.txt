 Talk about the place where you are - the decor, the landscaping, the event, the city, etc.


Get your conversation partner thinking. Ask “How many people do you think are here?”
Point out something unusual in the environment. For example, “Did you see that huge dog over there?”

, Another way to change the subject is by bringing a new person into the conversation. Either introduce your conversation partner to someone else you know, or ask your partner to introduce you to someone.


If neither of you knows anyone at an event, suggest going together to a lively group and introducing yourselves together.
 You can tell the person you’ll be right back if you’d like to keep talking to them - a few minutes apart creates a natural reason for the topic to change.


Use a common excuse. Take a trip to the restroom, or to the buffet, or to get a few minutes of fresh air. , You can ask a friend to call at a specific time with a potential “emergency.” There are also apps that can automate the process.


This can be a particularly handy technique on a first date.
You can always decide to stick with the conversation, but the interruption provides a space in which to change the topic.

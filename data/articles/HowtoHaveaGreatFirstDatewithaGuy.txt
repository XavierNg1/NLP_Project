 Put the date out of your mind. Do not daydream about marrying him. If you get emotionally worked up you might be too anxious and serious on the date. Stay busy until it's time to get ready, then go. Look your absolute best but do not dress in something too revealing. Reveal some skin, but in just one place, like your legs or your back or show some cleavage.;
, Have some class and style and be comfortable in your outfit so you can relax.
 Don't worry about tomorrow or the next date, just enjoy it now. Do decide ahead of time just how long you will stay on the date and stick to your limits.
 Be honest, but do not give too much information and do not discuss touchy subjects. Do not share your faults and problems. Don't "let it all hang out" because you "don't like to play games."

, Above all, do not discuss how much you want to get married and have kids. That will scare a new guy off immediately. Have some boundaries about what you will and will not talk about. Guys will try to pry information out of you. It is his "job" on the date to find out everything. This is part of his hunt and chase. Don't fall for that trap and spill too much about yourself.
 Guys love it when you are a little outrageous and can laugh at yourself. Sing some karaoke, sneak into a back door, or play a fun trick on a friend together. These things create a bond and the excitement drives up the chemicals in your brain, leaving you both happy, content and full of energy. Don't drink too much, and don't have sex with anybody on the first date. Be discriminating and get to know people before you go there. Sex is a big decision, and having sex too early can totally change the way your relationship plays out in ways you might not realize, so hang on and just don't go there.

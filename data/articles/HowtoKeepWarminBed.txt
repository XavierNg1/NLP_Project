 Ones with shorts or short sleeves are not good for when it's really cold and neither is a short nightdress. Try long-sleeved pajamas with long pajama bottoms. A one-piece pair of pajamas can be a great idea too, especially one with feet.;
, Make sure the water is hot from the tap but not boiling. Do not free-quarters full. Squeeze out any remaining air, put the stopper in, and dry the top and sides. Then put it into its cover, which 1) it protects feet against too much heat, and 2) because it totally transforms something functional and ordinary into something very cute and pretty which the grumpiest of teenagers will love to have in their bed!

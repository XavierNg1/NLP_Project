 This is the ideal time to shift this variety of belladonna lilies. The leaves on the plant should have turned brown and have died off. The bulbs are now dormant.;
, Return one portion to the original place and then move the rest to their new homes in the garden.
 When returning the bulbs to the ground, be sure to place two-thirds of the bulb under the ground.
 Don't be surprised if they don't flower the next season. The disruption may have been too much and the bulb might need time to recuperate. Flowering will return either the next year or the one following.

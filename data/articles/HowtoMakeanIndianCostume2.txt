 For best results, choose a pair that is roughly the same shade as the pillowcase used for the tunic. The pants should be fairly tight rather than baggy. Semi-baggy pants will work as long as they fit, but pants that are just wide enough to slip on and off are ideal. If desired, you can slim the pants by having the intended wearer try them on and pinning along the sides to desired tightness. Turn the pants inside out and sew along the pin-line. Finally, cut off the excess material and turn the pants right-side-out again.
 Cut two long strips of canvas, felt, or another strong fabric in a shade that matches the pants as closely as possible. The strips should be long enough to extend from the waist to the hem of the pants along the sides. To create the fringe, cut 1-inch (2.5-cm) slits along one side of the strip. Space the slits approximately a 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) apart.The strips should be about 1.5 inches (3.8-cm) wide.
If you’re short on time, you can also use store-bought fringe.
 Use fabric glue or a needle and thread to attach the strips of fringe to the sides of both pant legs. If you want to make sure that the pants can be worn multiple times, it’s best to sew on the fringe. Glue or sew along the 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) wide section of the band that does not have fringe on it, and apply it over the side seam on each pants leg.
If you prefer to wear a skirt with your costume, add the fringe all along the hem of a brown or tan skirt instead.

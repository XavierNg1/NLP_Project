 If you're logged into Twitter already, doing so will open Twitter's Home page.


If you aren't logged in, click Log in in the top-right corner of the window, enter your username (or email address) and password, and click Log in.
 It's in the top-right side of the Twitter window, just left of the Tweet button.
 This option is near the bottom of the drop-down menu.
 It's near the top of the "Accounts" page. As you type, Twitter will check your username to make sure it isn't already taken.


If your username is free, you'll see "Available!" listed above the "Username" field.
 This will invoke a pop-up window with a password entry field.
 Do so in the pop-up window here.
 It's the blue button at the bottom of the pop-up window. Doing so will apply your new username to your account.

 To save calories, you may spray the foil with cooking spray instead. You can either use your hand or a pastry brush to rub the oil onto the foil.
 If the fish has skin, the skin side should be in contact with the foil and the flesh side should be facing up.
 Use 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper as a good basic seasoning. You may also add a squirt of fresh lemon juice for additional flavor.

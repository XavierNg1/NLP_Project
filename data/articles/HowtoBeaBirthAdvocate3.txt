 Obstetricians and nurses frequently work with birth advocates and are often happy to meet them in advance.


Take advantage of an advance meeting to discuss the mother’s preferences with the delivery doctor, midwife, or nurses. This will make communication easier during the delivery and give you all the opportunity to address potential concerns prior to the delivery.
Some doctors or nurses may be very happy to give you pointers for communicating with them and other birthing staff during the delivery. They may also be able to tell you what to expect about interacting with staff and helping advocate for the mother in a way that the staff will respect and appreciate.
 If your role will involve firm statements about the mother’s decisions, such as “She does not want any medication,” practicing a firm but respectful tone may give you the confidence you need to effectively communicate for the mother during delivery.
 Once the mother has been admitted for the birth, let staff know who you are and why you are there so that they know who to consult with questions or concerns first. Introducing yourself will also remind the staff that you are there for the mother and that she has clear expectations for what she wants out of her delivery and assistance.
 As a birth advocate, your job is to verbally defend the mother’s decisions as much as necessary, but if the mother has changed her mind it becomes your job to defend her new choices.


If a mother is disappointed to have to accept medical or surgical intervention due to the circumstances of her delivery, your role as a birth advocate will become essential to her confidence and satisfaction with the birth process. Remind her that she is making the best decision for her and her baby and refocus her on safely delivering a healthy child.

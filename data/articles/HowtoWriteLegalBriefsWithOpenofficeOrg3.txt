 That will open a page style box. To begin, I just tweak the "Default" template which I will use for the cover page. I just make the margins 1.5 on the sides and 1 on the top and bottom. That's it.
 A box with a list of styles will appear. Click the fourth icon over, which is the page style icon. The preloaded page styles will appear (including your default style). Right click and choose "new." The page style box will appear with "Untitled 1" at the top. Change the name of this to "appellate brief index style." Set the margins to 1.5 by 1. Also, where the page tab is, move down under "lay-out settings" and change the numbering system to "i, ii, ii." This will be important later.
 You can leave the numbering system for this page style the same.

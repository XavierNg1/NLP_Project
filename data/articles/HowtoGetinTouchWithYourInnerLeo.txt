 Leo is the sign of the born leader. It is your role to lead others at work, in the community, in all that your talents lead you to. The lion symbolizes sovereignty, rule, and leading; live up to this by being regal, authoritative and knowledgeable. Avoid being too bossy.;
, Leo is a sign that likes to work to the full and to do a good job. Work with intensity and determination to get the job done.
 Leos also like to relax to the full. This makes sense as a Leo does nothing by half measures.
 Leos seek the affirmation from others that their deeds are worthy and that their intent is always good. Demonstrate to others that you are noble by always keeping your word, being timely, doing what you say that you will do and never gossiping or rumor-mongering.
 Leos are very loyal to their friends, family, and community. Leos have a very expansive view of who counts in their world and are very capable of embracing every person in their lives as a person to whom they owe loyalty. In turn, Leos always expect loyalty back and do not be surprised if you lose faith in a person unable to give you this.
 Leos are idealistic by nature and coupled with leadership, this is how things happen.
 Leos live it up and are the life of the party. Get out there and inject your warmth, humor, and entertaining anecdotes into the crowd to get it pumping!

Use soap and water, rubbing your hands clean for 20 seconds or more each time.You can also use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol to clean your hands during the day. Keep hand sanitizer in your desk or your bag and pull it out whenever you touch a potentially dirty surface in public.
Try not to touch your mouth, eyes, or nose with dirty hands. Wash your hands before touching any of these spots.
 Sharing these items can lead to the spread of germs and bacteria via saliva. Spreading saliva to others and with others can increase your risk of contracting viruses like measles. Keep your utensils, water bottles, cups, and dishes separate from others. Do not share them with anyone.You should also avoid sharing lip chap or lip gloss with others, as this can lead to the spread of germs via saliva.

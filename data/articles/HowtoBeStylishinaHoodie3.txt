 For many, athletic shoes or trainers are the default choice when wearing a hoodie. This can look great, but if you want to create a particularly stylish vibe, wear it with a nice pair of shoes, like black boots, pointy-toed dress shoes or red leather booties. This particular contrast can look very polished. Be sure you stick with a streamlined hoodie that fits snugly to keep your overall silhouette looking sleek.You can even opt for a pair of statement shoes, like patent leather combat boots in a shiny blue color. Experiment with any classic dressy shoe in an eye-catching hue.
 An awesome pair of sunglasses can instantly make almost anything look cooler, and that includes a hoodie. Try a pair of high-end dark black cat eye sunglasses, or an oversized pair with round mirrored lenses in a fun color, like bright orange.If you have the money to spend, go for a nice pair of designer sunglasses to really amp up the style. However, you can create the same effect with a pair of more affordable sunglasses with a trendy frame.
 This will keep your head warm during the cold winter months while also creating a cool, street-style inspired vibe. Look for a fisherman style beanie hat in a dark neutral color, like dark gray or black. You can match it to your hoodie, or create a trendy contrast by wearing it with a hoodie in a completely different color. Keep the rest of your outfit simple to complete this look.You could also try wearing a plain hoodie with a striped knit cap or beanie to create a different kind of contrast.

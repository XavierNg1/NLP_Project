 If you are going on a long flight, try to bring your own blankets, pillows, headphones, and entertainment. Airlines wash blankets and pillows infrequently. Unless you are flying right after they are washed, you are likely using things that other people have used and covered with their germs., If it is an option, try to order a hot meal during your flight. Properly heating your food will kill any germs that might make you sick. If a warm meal is not an option, consider bringing your own snacks or foods.Prepackaged snacks like crackers, pretzels, and nuts should be fine.
 If you are sitting next to someone who is ill, ask a flight attendant if you can change seats. Sitting in close proximity to someone who is ill increases your chances of getting sick by nearly 10 percent. Aisle seats are also dangerous because of the high amount of foot traffic. If the plane is not full, you may be able to sit somewhere else.Say something like “Do you mind if I switch seats?” or “Is it possible if I switch seats?”
If moving is not an option, you should consider wearing a mask or asking if the sick person would mind wearing a mask.
 Because hundreds of people will pass through a plane on a given day, almost every surface in the plane may be covered in germs. This is particularly true of the bathrooms, tray tables, and armrests. If you can, use a tissue or paper towel when touching things on the airplane and always wash your hands.Do not store your things in the seat-back pouch because this area may harbor bacteria due to people storing tissues and sick bags here.

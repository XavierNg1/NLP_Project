 Make a habit of warming up before running, sprinting, or playing sports like soccer and basketball that require a lot of heaving footwork.


Do a light one-mile jog before going on longer runs.Walk briskly for a block or two before you break into a run.
 Shin splints can be caused by running on pavement or concrete surfaces, since the shin bears the brunt of the impact.


Try running on dirt paths or grass instead of the road or the sidewalk.
If you must run on the road, mix up your routine with biking, swimming and other cross training exercises so you aren't pounding the pavement every day.
 If your shoes are worn out, new shoes with more cushioning can help disperse stress on the shin. If you have an overpronation or over supination, buy shoes designed to help with this problem.
 If you're prone to getting shin splints, you may want to ask your doctor to fit your feet with orthotics or arch supports. These are special shoe inserts that will change the way you strike the ground with your feet and prevent your legs from getting overstrained.

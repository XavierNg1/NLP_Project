 Using an unusual object to house your tank provides it with a lot of character right off the bat. Find an old console TV for a larger tank in your attic or at a thrift store. Or, if you don’t have room for a new piece of furniture, create one out of an older model TV pre-dating flat screens.


Choose your TV based on the requirements of your fish, if you have already chosen which fish you want to include. Check online for guidelines, and make sure to account for the full-grown size of your fish.You will need to gut out the TV components and place a tank inside the shell. Ask your parents or another adult to help you if you aren’t comfortable with cutting tools.
You could also use an old computer monitor for a similar look. Use any substrate, plants, and other decorations you like. You may want to focus on traditional materials to complement the vintage look of the TV. Or mix it up by using more modern, colorful floor materials and decorations.;
, Instead, make your own aquarium in the dimensions you want and top it with a large piece of wood or stone, or a sheet of glass. Make sure to include an opening to feed your fish and include necessary equipment, like a filter.
, Purchase a pre-made fish tank sink or bathtub/fish tank combo. Fish tank toilets are even available. Get all three, paint your bathroom blue or blue-green, and the whole room will look like a fancy aquarium.


If you are good at carpentry, you may be able to make your own sink aquarium. Follow basic instructions and include space for plumbing features.

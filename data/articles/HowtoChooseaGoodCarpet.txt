 If you plan to put a carpet in the bedroom, then it won't have as much "traffic" as a carpet in the living room.;
, This is something to think about with any carpet, especially carpets that are going to be used in a dining room or play room area where there will be a steady stream of food or possibilities for spills.
 Indoor carpeting is normally rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest rating. Carpets with a 5 rating are considered the best for heavy traffic areas. Rating of 4 are considered outstanding and recommended for heavy traffic areas of your home.
 The highest quality of carpet you can buy is a carpet made out of wool. Wool carpets are very expensive, but greatly out perform any other man made carpet.
 If you have a high traffic area, then nylon would be an ideal choice due to the durability. Nylon is stain resistant as well, and repels mildew.
 Polyester is known for the look and feel of wool, although it is much less expensive.
 Light colored carpets create an effect of a larger space, although they do tend to show stains more easily. Dark carpets on the other hand tend to absorb light, giving a room what many know as the "cozy feeling".

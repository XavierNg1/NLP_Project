 Most people save details like bank accounts, login information for different accounts, and even personal pictures on their mobile phones and laptops. When these devices are lost or stolen, all your personal information gets compromised.
 If you can’t avoid saving personal information on your gadgets, then you could at least try to encrypt your devices by adding security measures such as passwords. This way, in the event your device gets lost, it won’t be easy for anyone to just open it up and steal data.
 Secure media storages, such as DVD/CDs, flash drives, and external/internal hard disks, that you use to store your personal information. Put it in a secure location, away from places where people might pick it up.
 Even if it isn’t in digital form, paper documents can also be stolen without you knowing it. Cameras now have high resolutions that it can copy these documents in a flash. You can keep these documents inside personal vaults or have it stored inside a personal safety deposit box in banks.
 When you’re through with a particular document, such as expired IDs and forms, dispose of them properly to avoid other people reusing it.


You can burn these documents or use shredding machines.






For digital storages, make sure you wipe out its contents before you dispose it.

 This medication is sold as Pepcid AC. Famotidine is an H2-antagonist that inhibits acid secretion in the stomach. It helps to soothe gastric ulcers and reduce inflammation when the stomach lining is inflamed. The drug should be used with caution in cats with heart disease because it can slow the heart rate, but this is usually only a problem when given intravenously.


The dose is 0.5 mg/kg once a day, by mouth. A 5 kg cat thus requires 2.5 mg a day., A probiotic designed for cats can speed up recovery from diarrhea. Wait to start the probiotic until your cat has stopped vomiting, then mix the probiotic with the bland food once a day. This helps to repopulate the gut with the correct bacteria that aids in digestion. Repopulating the gut helps feces to firm up more quickly.


An appropriate cat probiotic is Fortiflora, which comes in a sachet. It can be mixed in food and given to your cat once a day for five days.
 Kaolin and pectin absorb toxins produced in the gut, and also line the gut wall to provide a protective barrier. Its effectiveness is questionable, but some animals do seem to benefit, so talk to your vet before giving your cat this over-the-counter medication.
 Maropitant can help to stop your cat from vomiting. The medication can be given by injection and is highly effective at relieving nausea and preventing vomiting because the drug acts on the brain and switches off the vomiting center.
 Another prescription medication is atropine. Atropine is an antispasmodic which causes the bowel to relax, and then as the effects of the atropine wear off, the bowel reverts back to a normal action.


The benefit of giving atropine to cats with diarrhea is controversial. Some veterinarians argue that the toxins are better "out than in" and that antispasmodics such as atropine, cause the toxins to be retained in the bowel. The counter argument is that sometimes the bowel becomes sensitive because of diarrhea that it is constantly in spasm.

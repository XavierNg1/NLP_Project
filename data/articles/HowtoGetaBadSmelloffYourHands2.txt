 A method that is particularly suited to removing the odor from garlic and onions involves rubbing your hands on stainless steel. Simply take any stainless steel item (such as a piece of silverware or a mixing bowl) and rub it all over your hands under cold running water. Continue until the odor is neutralized.


Any stainless steel item will work for this method, including the basin of your sink if you have a stainless steel model. Additionally, you can purchase a stainless steel "soap" made precisely for this purpose. This tool is shaped just like a bar of soap for easy handling.
While findings have been inconclusive as to the mechanics of this process, it is generally thought that the sulfur in the garlic (and in many other odorous compounds) binds with the chromium in the stainless steel. This is why stainless steel must be used, and not other iron alloys, as they do not contain chromium.;

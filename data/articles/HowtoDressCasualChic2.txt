 Jeans are at the top of the list when it comes to essential casual chic clothing. A good pair of jeans is comfortable and hugs your hips and backside, but searching for the perfect pair isn't always easy. Everyone is a different body shape, so when you're trying on jeans from different companies, you should consider trying on a pair a size up and a size down from the one you normally where.


Once you've got your pair of nice denim jeans, look into dark-wash or black jeans. You can use these to slightly "dress up" your casual chic.
 Pair them with leggings or simply wear them alone for a simple and comfortable look. As with tops, you should aim for mostly neutral colors, though a few popping patterns can be paired wonderfully with a neutral top and/or a nice baggy sweater.
 Both comfortable and versatile, leggings go great with a long, flowing shirt or even a shorter dress. Having the leggings not only makes the outfit more comfortable, it downplays some of the "showy" aspects of the dress to make it seem more casual.
 Light wear and tear will definitely get across the idea of casual, opening you up to wear a nice top to bring in the "chic." A lot of casual chic is about mixing and matching "classy" clothes with a more laid-back, comfortable piece, and distressed pants and shorts (like white/beige cutoffs) are a great place to start

, Jean shorts, cutoffs, and even the occasional pair of nice running shorts can all look good when the weather is getting toasty. Again, aim for pieces that are easy to mix and match: beige, white, tan, denim, and black all pair well with a variety of tops.

 Alternatively, grow the plant from seed in spring to obtain really good flowering plants.


This plant can also be propagated by cuttings.;
,, A sunny windowsill is ideal or a south-facing room (northern hemisphere) or a north-facing room (southern hemisphere). Avoid growing the plant in conditions under 10ÂºC.
 Don't over-water or water log it though; the soil should be evenly moist and well draining.


Mist the foliage regularly if the humidity is below 50 percent and use a pebble tray to stand the plant on.
 Use a general liquid fertiliser.
 It's not likely to provide as good a show of flowers the next year that it is grown unless you feed and water it regularly.


If keeping, repot it in the spring.

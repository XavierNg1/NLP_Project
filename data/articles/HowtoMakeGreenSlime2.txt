 This method is less common, but some people find it easier because it uses less mixing. Get the following items so you'll be ready:Â½ cup white or clear school glue
Green food coloring
Liquid starch
Glass mixing bowl
Spoon
Plastic jar or sandwich bag

, Use clear school glue if you want clear slime. Use white school glue if you want solid slime.


You can also use green glitter glue if you want glitter slime.
 Add a few drops of yellow food coloring if you want a lighter green. Keep in mind that if you are using a white school glue, your slime will be pastel green.


You do not need to add food coloring if you are using green glitter glue.
 You want the color to be even. There should be no streaks.
 Add a tablespoon of liquid starch at a time. You will need about two parts glue to one part liquid starch.


If you are a child, ask an adult to help you with this step.
 The more you mix it, the smoother it will become. If the slime is still too watery, let it sit for a few minutes.You can also try adding in a little bit more liquid starch.
 You can use a plastic jar with a lid or a zippered sandwich bag.

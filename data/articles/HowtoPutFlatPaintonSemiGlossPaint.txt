 Wear rubber gloves if you have sensitive skin. With your sponge, wipe down your walls with the TSP, then wipe them again with a sponge dipped in clean water.;
, There are two ways to do this. Sand the entire wall with 100-grit sandpaper. Use a pole sander. You do not need to sand to bare wall. All you need to do is to rough up the shine of the semi-gloss paint. The other way is to use a paint brush and apply a deglosser (available at most good hardware stores). You'll spread on a coat of deglosser with your brush and then wipe it off with a clean cloth. Then rub your wall down with a wet sponge frequently dipped in clean water.
, Paint with a medium-grade (or better) flat paint.

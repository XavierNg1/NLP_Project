 First, the juicer crushes the fruits and vegetables. Second, the juicer presses the juice from the crushed produce. As a result, fewer vitamins, minerals, and fiber are lost. These juicers take a little longer than other electric juicers, but they make a high-quality choice for leafy greens, wheatgrass, sprouts, root vegetables, and water-dense fruits., Centrifugal juicers are the fastest and most common. The juicer grinds the produce and pushes the juice through an enclosed strainer by quickly spinning the pulp. The pulp and juice are separated, but the pulp does tend to be fairly moist, suggesting that not all the juice has been squeezed out. Most fruits and vegetables work well with a centrifugal juicer, but it should not be used for wheatgrass or dandelion greens., Masticating juicers use a single gear to grind produce fibers using a steady rotating motion. These juicers can take a while, but the juice that is produced is relatively high-quality. Most fruits and vegetables can be juiced using a masticating juicer, and you can also use these juicers to produce baby food, sauce, and nut butter., If you do not have a juicer and do not want to buy one, you can usually use an ordinary blender to create the juice. A blender will not separate the pulp from the juice, of course, so you will need to do that manually by running the blended, pulpy juice through a wire mesh strainer., Hand juicers are a little old-fashioned, but they still work for many applications. Citrus juicers and wheatgrass juicers are the two main types.

Citrus juicers are fairly common. Cut a citrus fruit, like lemon, lime, orange, or grapefruit, in half. Wring the half out over the juicer using the juicer's peak.
Wheatgrass juicers are used to literally grind the juice out of wheatgrass or other similar grasses. They work similar to the way that a masticating juicer works, except that you operate it by hand rather than by electricity.

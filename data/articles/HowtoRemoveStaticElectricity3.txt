 Baking soda creates a barrier between positive and negative charges from building up and creating static.


Depending on the size of the laundry load, you may need to adjust the amount of baking soda you add in. For bigger loads you can add about ½ cup of baking soda, and for small loads you can use 1 or 2 tablespoons of baking soda.Baking soda is also considered a water softener and a fabric softener.
 When your wash machine is transitioning to the rinse cycle, pause the machine and pour in ¼ cup of white distilled vinegar. Restart the machine to continue the rinse cycle.Vinegar serves as both a fabric softener and static reducer in the laundry.
 For the last 10 minutes of the drying cycle, turn the dryer to the lowest heat setting, and add a damp washcloth to the machine. Allow the dryer to carry out the rest of the drying cycle.The damp washcloth helps add moisture to the air, preventing electrical charges from building up in the dryer.
 As soon as your clothes are finished drying in the dryer, take them out and shake them. This prevents static electricity from setting in.Alternatively, to reduce static even more, you can air dry your clothes and hang them on a clothesline to dry.

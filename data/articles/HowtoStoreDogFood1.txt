 Dry food isa convenient and cost effective way to feed a dog and requires minimal storage space. However, if the dry food is not stored properly, it can spoil and make your dog sick. The fats in the food can go rancid while vitamins can be destroyed if the proper conditions are not met., The original packaging for your dog’s dry food has a fat barrier that helps to keep it fresh. Although some people like to keep dry dog food in plastic storage containers, it is best to keep the food stored in the original bag.Bags of dry food can also be stored in the freezer if it takes you a long time to go through a bag.
If you prefer to use a storage container, make sure that it is air tight and that it is made from opaque material to protect the dry food from light. Stainless steel containers are also a good option., Dry dog food should be kept somewhere where the temperature is under 100 °F (38 °C)and where the food will be protected from moisture. For the most part, the best place to store dry food is in the house. Storing dry dog food in garages and sheds makes it hard to regulate the temperature unless these structures are insulated and temperature controlled.

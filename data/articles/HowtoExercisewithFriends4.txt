 If you have a large group of friends, you can get everyone together to go on a hiking trip. Hikes are great exercise that people of different fitness levels can enjoy. They are also a good way to get a lot of people together and exercising.


You can choose a nearby state or local park to visit.
Make it a weekend trip by getting everyone together to go camping or stay in a cabin near longer hiking trails.
 Group fitness classes at gyms or studios generally allow up to 30 people per class. This means you can get a group of friends together and take an exercise class together. You may want to try spin, zumba, yoga, pilates, or weightlifting.


The number of people per class may vary from gym to gym.
 One of the best ways to exercise with your friends is to go to the park and play a group team sport. When playing with friends, you don't have to worry about whether you are good or not. Instead, you are playing for fun and to be active.


You may want to try different sports every week. Try baseball, basketball, flag football, rugby, field hockey, soccer, kickball, or croquet.

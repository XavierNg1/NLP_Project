 The initial fever, lameness, and lymph node enlargement may pass without treatment, but this does not mean the dog is in the clear. At any stage (days, weeks, months later) the borrelia may cause damage in the heart, kidney, or even brain.
 Although rare, the kidney can be seriously damaged by large quantities of immune-related proteins flooding the kidney and overwhelming its ability to filter and get rid of them in the urine. This damages the kidney and can lead to kidney failure. Signs of this include:


Excessive thirst and urination
Poor appetite
Dehydration
Appetite loss
Vomiting
Stupor

 These include a complete heart block which manifests itself as no heartbeat and sudden death

MODIFIED AGAIN: H4: Input 30 . Insert New Comment and edit in "=Spheroids is original formula because most often Spheroids2 is the Standard or Goal for Spheroids, and needs to correspond per period on a 1:1 basis. Was 40. Was 12. Now 30." Expand the comment frame if need be.
MODIFIED AGAIN: I4: Input 1. Insert New Comment and edit in "Original formula =ShrinkExpand is most usual value as Standard or Goal, e.g. 100% of Normal. But if 80% of Normal is the New Goal, say for a Personal Fitness Program, then a little math is required.  ShrinkExpand2 = 1/.80, or 1.25 would be the new input. This is because it was thought the natural trend would be to want to shrink by say a factor of 2, so 2 = 1/.50 and the New Goal is to be 50% of Normal, or shrink by a factor of 2 (as a divisor). You may change the formulas and comments so that ShrinkExpand and ShrinkExpand2 are multiplicative instead of divisive if preferred. Was 1.19122798149309. Was =(1/E2890)^(3/2). Now = 1." Expand the comment frame if need be. In cell E2890 should be the formula "=MAX(E6:E2886)"and above it the MIN formula.
K4: Input 0.9 and Insert New Comment with this value as what's now current if you prefer.
NEW: L4: Input "=16*107"

Select cell range A5:I5 and Format Cell Font Underline. Select the following cells with Shift+Command: C4, D4, F4. G4, H4, I4, K4, L4, J2, M2, N2 and Format Cell Fill canary yellow (for input cells) and Font size 14. Format Cells A4:L4 Number Number Decimal Places 4 and select column range A:N and do Format Column Autofit Selection.,, Expand the comment frame if need be. Do Format Cell Fill Light Rose color to distinguish it from the other cells in the column.
MODIFIED: Edit Go To cell range A7:A2886 and with A7 the active high-lighted cell, input "=(A6+(-Tip*2)/(AjRows))" and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell A7 and copy the the formula in the formula bar and do Insert New Comment and edit comment "Original formula "=(A6+(-Tip*2)/(AjRows)) to bottom A2886 (as adjusts per cell on the way down)". Expand the comment frame if need be.
MODIFIED: Cell B6: Input "=IF(Spheroids<=24, Base*24/Spheroids,Base*24/Spheroids) and do Insert New Comment "Original formula is really =Base*24/Spheroids"
Edit Go To cell range B7:B2886 and with B7 the active high-lighted cell, input "=B6" and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell B7 and copy the the formula in the formula bar and do Insert New Comment and edit comment "Original formula =B6 to bottom B2886 (as adjusts per cell on the way down)". Expand the comment frame if need be.
Edit Go To cell range C6:C2886 and with C6 the active high-lighted cell input "=Spheroids/KEY*(COS((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))" and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell C6 and do Insert New Comment and edit it "Original Formula =Spheroids/KEY*(COS((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))". Expand the comment frame if need be. This formula and the next one form the ring the Spheroids occupy, By taking the cosine of the cell 6 rows above the cell it's in, C6, the formula is taking the cosine of 0, which = 1.
MODIFIED: Edit Go To cell range D6:D2886 and with D6 the active high-lighted cell input "=Spheroids/KEY*(SIN((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))" and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell D6 and do Insert New Comment and edit it "Original Formula =Spheroids/KEY*(SIN((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1)). By taking the sine of the cell 6 rows above the cell we're in, C6, the formula is taking the sine of 0, which = 0. Therefore, between the formula in C6 and the one in D6, the {x,y} coordinates of the first cell would be {1,0} if nothing else were affecting them. It proceeds counterclockwise from there. so that is how to read the chart, from 0 degrees counter clockwise back to 360 degrees. Even though there are basically 2880 rows being charted, and 2880/360 = 8, the factor = 1/8th at .125, so a level of detail is achieved while keeping everything normalized for a single cycle in the typical case.
Edit Go To cell range E6:E2886 and with E6 the active high-lighted cell, input the formula, "=((SIN(A6/(B6*2))*GM*COS(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(B6*2)))*GM)+C6)*VLOOKUP(ROW(),SpreadLooker,3)/ShrinkExpand" w/o quote marks and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell E6 and do Insert New Comment "Original Formula =((SIN(A6/(B6*2))*GM*COS(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(B6*2)))*GM)+C6)*VLOOKUP(ROW(),SpreadLooker,3)/ShrinkExpand multiplies each term of the standard formula for a spherical helix per 'CRC Standard Curves and Surfaces' by David von Seggern, 1993, by GM (Golden Mean) to keep things proportional, with the z dimension added into the x and y dimensions. This is then multiplied by the Lookup Table SpreadLooker, which either randomizes the data or accepts inputs per the Goal Looker worksheet. Lastly, it is subject to ShrinkExpand, a variable for normalizing or growing or shrinking its chart relative to the Standard or Goal chart data series of Second X and Second Y." Expand the comment frame as much as necessary. I realize that there will be #NAME? error values -- these will be fixed in a little while.
Edit Go To cell range F6:F2886 and with F6 the active high-lighted cell, input the formula,"=((SIN(A6/(B6*2))*GM*SIN(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(B6*2)))*GM)+D6)*VLOOKUP(ROW(),SpreadLooker,3)/ShrinkExpand" w/o quote marks and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell F6 and do Insert New Comment "Original Formula =((SIN(A6/(B6*2))*GM*SIN(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(B6*2)))*GM)+D6)*VLOOKUP(ROW(),SpreadLooker,3)/ShrinkExpand (see note in E6 for details)." I realize that there will be #NAME? error values -- these will be fixed in a little while.
MODIFIED: Cell G6: Input "=IF(Spheroids2
Edit Go To cell range G7:G2886 and with G7 the active high-lighted cell, input the formula,"=G6". Do Insert New comment and edit in "Original Formula =G6 down to G2886 as adjusts per cell thereto."

Select cell W2 and input 1. Do Insert Comment and edit comment "Try .25 or .5 when Lookup Table fully operational -- playing with this idea -- not settled yet. Entering a 6 leads to beginning of chaos! Has to do with Phases?" Inputting .6 in the current circumstances leads to rows>2880 but the design is not so great.
MODIFIED: Select cell U6 and input the formula, "=(6+AjRows/(Spheroids))/DIVIDED_BY". Do Insert New Comment and edit in "Original formula =(6+AjRows/(Spheroids))/DIVIDED_BY. So, in the case of 24 Spheroids and 2880 AjRows, 2880/24 = 120 + 6 = 126. The original Vlookup formula finds which row() it's currently in and compares it to this number, thus bracketing the data (spheroids) into groups (of rows)."
MODIFIED: Select cell U4 and enter formula "=U6-6" w/o quotes. Do Insert New Comment and edit in "Original formula =U6-6." Insert Name Define Increment for cell $U$4. Do Format Cells Number Custom "Increment "0 and double click the U column header's right divider line to auto-adjust to fit. Format Font 14 red and Border Blue bold Outline.

MODIFIED: Edit Go To cell range A2:C65 and Insert Name Define  Goal_Looker_Eggbasket  to cell range $A$2:$C$65.
Edit Go To cell range A2:A65 and with A2 the active high-lighted cell, input 1, then do Edit Fill Series Columns Linear Step Value 1 OK.
MODIFIED AGAIN: Copy column B's contents to a safe empty column for now. Edit Go To E2:E65 and input 1.5 into cell E2 and do shift+tab and input 0 into cell E65 and do Edit Fill Series Column accept the proposed Step Value OK. Copy these values and do Paste Special Values into cell range B2:B65 to see the large spiral effect on the chart. You may notice that since there are 24 divisions of 2880 due to 24 typically being the number of Spheroids, that if you look across from 24 in column B or E that the last value is .95, not the bottom value of 0. It's possible to do Insert New Comment about this at the top on the label Spiral or in the first active formula cell.
 To get a good chart, columns E:I of the Data worksheet should be error-free. See the Warnings section below for help in errors reduction.,

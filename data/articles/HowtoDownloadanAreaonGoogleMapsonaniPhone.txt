 This app looks like a map containing a white “G.";
, It's at the top of the page.
 For example, “San Diego, CA.” A list of locations will pop up under the search bar.


You can also search a more specific location, such as a business or address.



If you don’t see the location you’re looking for in the list, or the list doesn't pop up, tap Search. It’s on the bottom right-hand corner of your keyboard. This will pull up a full list of locations based on the search term.
 Doing so will reveal a page with information about the location, such as points of interest, local weather, and population.
 This is under the location’s name, to the right of the Save and Share options. This will put a draggable rectangular frame over the area.


If you aren’t signed in with your Google account, you’ll be prompted to do so.
If you're searching for an address or business, you'll need to tap ⋮ → Download offline area. The ⋮ icon is located at the upper right-hand corner of the page.
 You can drag the frame so it captures the area you want to download. You can also pinch the screen to zoom in and out.


Selecting and downloading very large areas can take up a lot of storage space.
 It’s at the bottom right-hand side of the screen. Once your map has downloaded, you can find it by searching for the location as you normally would. If a connection is weak or nonexistent, Google maps will still be able to pull up the area you downloaded while it’s offline.


You can view the download’s progress in the middle of the screen, under the map.
To stop or cancel the download while it's in progress, tap Pause. It’s at the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. You'll have the option to delete or resume your download.

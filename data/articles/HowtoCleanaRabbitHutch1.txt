 Rabbit hutches should be cleaned every day to ensure that your rabbit lives in a clean and sanitary environment. Soiled bedding material and old food can easily create an unclean hutch. Plan to take a few minutes every day to tidy up your hutch.;
, Place your rabbit in a temporary holding pen, rabbit run, or another place where she’ll be safe while you clean the hutch. Be sure to give her some food and water, along with a couple of toys.
 Take out old and unwanted food. Remove soiled litter, hay, and fur from the hutch.


Wear gloves as you remove these materials. Place them in a garbage bag for disposal.
 Rabbits mark their territory with scents. They can become stressed if they are reintroduced to a hutch that does not have any familiar scent. When you empty out the hutch, leave one small area untouched.The next time you clean the hutch, leave a different area alone. Make sure to clean the area that you skipped this time.
 As you empty the hutch, use this opportunity to check your rabbit’s health by observing how much food and water is being consumed. Is your rabbit eating a good amount of food and drinking a good amount of water?Also check the droppings that your rabbit has left. Are the feces and urine normal in appearance?

, Inspect the cage for damage, holes, and other problems that might compromise the safety of your rabbit.Throw out any toys that are damaged or frayed.
 Many wire cages have a tray underneath that catches droppings. Dump out all material that has collected in this tray.
 When you’ve finished cleaning out the hutch, replace the materials that line the bottom of the cage. Make sure there is enough material to cover the entire bottom of the hutch.
 Allow your rabbit back into the hutch. Be sure to close the hutch door securely.

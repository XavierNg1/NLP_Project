 Know what you are expected to accomplish to help you stay focused on healing and being released. Ask lots of questions about the doctors expectations for release. Ask about your progress frequently and what still needs to be done.Know your diagnosis, and understand the associated symptoms you may be experiencing.
Know the treatment goal and expected behavioral outcomes.
Know what kind of treatment will be used to help you reach your treatment goals: individual psychotherapy, group counseling, family therapy, and/or medication.
 Take advantage of all of the therapy options. You will likely have individual sessions, but you should take advantage of group session as often as possible also. Psychotherapy can help improve mood, increase empathy, and decrease anxiety.Eagerly participating in therapy may also be taken as a sign of your commitment to mental health and willingness to comply with treatment plans, which may contribute to an early discharge.
 There will be a lot of rules. It is important to learn these and follow them. There will likely be rules about when and where you can eat, where your can spend your free time, participation in treatment activities, like therapy, when and where to take medication, when you may use the phone, how you physically interact with others, and when and where you may visit with family. Failure to comply with any of the rules may be deemed as noncompliance and could extend your hospitalization or movement to an even more regimented ward.


If you disagree with the type of medication you are required to take, ask to talk to the doctor because you have concerns. A willingness to relationally discuss treatment options will be viewed more favorable than outright refusal.

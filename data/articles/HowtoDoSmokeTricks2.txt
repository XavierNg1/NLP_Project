 Your tricks will be easier to pull off and look better if you don't drag the smoke into your lungs.
 You don't want the smoke to get too far out of your mouth. Open you mouth halfway and slowly exhale the smoke from your mouth for 1-2 seconds.









You are, in a way, simply letting the smoke escape on its own. You can tilt your head back to make it even easier.
 When the smoke is still in a cloud, 2-4" from your face, quickly suck it back in. You might move your head towards it to get it all. Keep your lips somewhat close together as you inhale to make it easier to get powerful suction.
 The principles are the same -- you let the smoke out of your mouth and then suck it back in, but snap inhales are much quicker and more impressive. To do one:









Take a 2-3 second drag, keeping the smoke in your mouth.
Curl your tongue up to the roof of your mouth, with your lips still closed.
As you open your mouth, snap your tongue down to force the smoke out with a short puff of air.
Quickly purse your lips, like you were whistling, and suck back in the cloud of smoke.

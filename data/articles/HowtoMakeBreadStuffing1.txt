 Set the temperature of the oven to 180Â°C.;
,, Place the saucepan on a medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the butter, onions, and celery. Cook until the onions are translucent.
 Transfer the vegetables to a bowl and add the crumbled, toasted bread, thyme, egg, and season with salt and pepper. Next, moisten with some vegetable stock and let it sit for a few minutes, just long enough for the mixture to soak up the liquid.
 Put the stuffing in the baking dish, cover it with aluminium foil and place it in the oven. After approximately 30 minutes, remove the foil and bake for another 20 minutes. When brown on the surface, remove from the oven.
 Serve as an ideal accompaniment to Thanksgiving, Christmas or Sunday meals.

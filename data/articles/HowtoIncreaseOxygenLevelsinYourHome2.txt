, Though not scientifically proven, some believe that lamps made from pink Himalayan salt may help to purify the air. They emit a nice pink glow as well. This may not generate enough negative ions to change your environment, but it might help remove some of the toxins in the air around you., Candles made of beeswax don’t smoke when they’re lit, and they don’t release chemicals as they burn. Similar to salt lamps, these candles don’t release enough ions to purify the air completely. However, beeswax candles may be a healthier substitute for more common candles made of paraffin, which usually emit pollutants.You can purchase beeswax candles at your local health food store or online.


Never let candles burn unattended.

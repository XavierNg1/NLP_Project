 At this point, you should see a "Roundabout Ahead" sign followed by a "Yield" sign. The recommended speed is normally 15 - 20 mph (24 - 32 kph).;
, Traffic already in the roundabout has the right-of-way. Do not enter unless a safe gap is present. If there is no traffic in the roundabout, you may enter the roundabout without yielding.Crosswalks are placed one or two car-lengths before the roundabout itself. Yield to any pedestrians who are in, or about to enter, the crosswalk.
 Maintain a low speed as you maneuver through the roundabout and proceed to your exit.
 This will inform other drivers that you wish to exit the roundabout, easing confusion.
 Remember that drivers inside the roundabout have the right-of-way. Unless a pedestrian is crossing the crosswalk or an emergency vehicle, such as an ambulance, is entering or exiting the roundabout, proceed through the exit without stopping or slowing down.


If an emergency vehicle is about to enter or has already entered the roundabout, do not stop in the roundabout. Instead, exit out your original destination and only then pull over.

 Redirected aggression is an involuntary reflex. Your cat doesn’t mean to make you the target of its aggressive outburst; the cat simply reacts to how its body feels. If your cat is showing signs of aggression toward you for seemingly no reason, consider just walking away and giving your cat a chance to calm down.Leaving your cat alone to get over the feelings of aggression is the best bet to ensure that there is no unintended altercation between you and your pet.
You should also try to segregate the cat from any other pets or humans in the house.;
, If your cat is staring out the window with incredible intensity, you may want to try to break the spell. Try clapping your hands loudly or making another loud sound to startle the cat.This should hopefully cause your cat to stop paying attention to whatever it is that is agitating it and give the cat an opportunity to calm down.
 Remember that when you’re dealing with an aggressive cat, it’s possible that you may get injured. The cat may bite you or claw you in its redirected aggressive outburst.If you have to engage with an aggressive cat, take the proper safety precautions. Wear thick gloves if possible or several layers of clothing.
Try to avoid separating your cat from another animal if it is behaving aggressively. But if you must interfere, be extremely careful and be cautious of bites and scratches. Try using a squirt bottle or pillow to break up a fight between cats.
Remember that it is possible for the cat to injure itself also. Try to control the cat’s behavior without provoking it to react in a way that is more harmful to itself.

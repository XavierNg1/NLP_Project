 These products are not as effective as ironing, but hanging your garment, spraying it with the product and then using your hands to remove wrinkles can be very effective. A spray bottle filled with fabric softener has pretty much the same effect and would be far less expensive., If you do find yourself with a crease, get it wet with warm water and gently pull at the fabric. This should reshape and release the creased fabric back to the original shape.
 Heat helps to release creases. If you find yourself with light creases in your clothing, try to hold a blow dryer to the crease to soften the wrinkle and smooth out the fabric.


Hold the blow dryer about ten inches away from the fabric and keep it set on low.
Don't hold the blow dryer in the same spot because it may burn the fabric. Instead, wave the blow dryer around from side to side.

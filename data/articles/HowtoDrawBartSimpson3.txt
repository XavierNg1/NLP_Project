 Add some guidelines (not too darkly) for the face.
 The spikes should blend into his forehead without any discernible hairline. (Don’t make them too large; Bart’s hair is not his primary feature, and you don’t want to take attention away from other parts of his body.)

, Draw two overlapping circles for the eyeballs and two small circles inside the larger ones for the pupils. The eyeballs should be more in the middle of the face than near the top, and make sure to space them evenly. Next, add a small oval for the nose and a half circle for the ear. Don't draw the mouth for now.
 The circle on the top should be smaller than the circle on the bottom.
 The finger ovals should be more elongated than the others, and if you want to draw him holding something, curl them around each other.
 Add a half oval to each for the feet. Sketch in a T-shirt, shorts, and shoes. Keep them basic--Bart’s attire is characterized by its simplicity.
 Add in more details and erase the guidelines.

 If you intend to use OptiFine alongside Minecraft Forge, you'll want to install Minecraft Forge (and any other Minecraft mods) before installing OptiFine. OptiFine should always be the last mod that you install.


You can download and install Forge from files.minecraftforge.net/.;
, You'll need to start up the Minecraft Launcher and load Forge once before you can install OptiFine.
 This will start Minecraft.
 You can see that Forge has loaded by looking in the lower-left corner of the Minecraft menu. It should display "Minecraft Forge XX.XX.XX." You can close Minecraft after verifying that Forge loaded properly.
 The location is different for Windows and OS X:


Windows - Press ⊞ Win+R and type %appdata%. This will open the Roaming folder. Open the ".minecraft" folder, which is usually at the top of the list.
Mac - Hold ⌥ Option and click the "Go" menu. Select "Library" from the menu. This will only appear if you are holding the ⌥ Option key.
 OptiFine has many different versions available. If you keep Minecraft up to date, you can just download the version at the top of the list at optifine.net/downloads, otherwise you'll want to download the latest release for the version of Minecraft you are running.


OptiFine will download as a single JAR file.
 You'll find this in your "minecraft" folder that you opened a couple steps ago. Simply drag the OptiFine JAR file that you downloaded into this "mods" folders.
 This will automatically load the OptiFine mod alongside Forge. You should see "OptiFine" appear in the lower-left corner of the Minecraft main menu.
 You can find your new advanced OptiFine settings by opening the "Options" menu and selecting "Video Settings."

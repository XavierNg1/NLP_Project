 You probably know this one already. Smoke is an extremely common cause of asthma attacks. Don’t allow smoking of any type, anywhere in your home. Similarly, don’t light incense or anything else that produces smoke either., Be sure to change the air filter on the furnace once a month. Add filters to the furnace outlets in your bedroom, and change them biweekly. You can use about ten layers of muslin or cheesecloth to make your own filter for this purpose.Wood stoves and kerosene heaters can create asthma triggers, especially when used in your bedroom.
 Whichever type of air conditioning you use, be sure to change and/or clean filters monthly. Avoid using fans of any type in your room, as they may keep asthma triggers suspended in the air. Keep bedroom windows closed, especially during seasons where you’re asthma is triggered outdoors., Especially if you live in a home with a basement, it can help to run a dehumidifier, especially during more humid parts of the year. Since dust mites are more prevalent in high humidity, keep your home below 50% humidity.Avoid using a humidifier, especially in your bedroom, as this can contribute to both mold and increased dust mites, both of which might trigger your asthma.

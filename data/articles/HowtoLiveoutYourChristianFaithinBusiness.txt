 If you claim to be a Christian but are always complaining, what does that say to your co-workers. Sure, everyone has tough days, and it's okay to admit it when you're struggling, but keep your overall attitude positive by reminding yourself that your job is a gift from God.;
, The highest value of the Christian faith is love. That doesn't mean you go around hugging people, it means you treat them with respect, value their opinions, treat them like you'd want to be treated. In his book The Little Red Book of Wisdom, Mark DeMoss offers this advice: "In going about the work God gives us, we must treat every person well, regardless of station or potential benefit to us. Let us stay keenly aware of the endless ripple of just being ourselves." (p. 75)

, And ultimately, everyone answers to God about the choices they make in this life.
 One of the most fundamental beliefs of the Christian faith is that each ordinary believer represents the faith as much as a pastor does. That doesn't mean you have to preach, but do your job with integrity. That means being honest, even if it costs you something. DeMoss writes: "Even when it comes at a high cost, honesty is always a bargain." (p. 61)

, Serving others without bragging about it is a sign a great strength. DeMoss writes: "Great leaders are first of all great servants--and great service is modest, understated, in speech and action. Understatement is self-restraint, and self-restrain is hardly a sign of weakness. On the contrary, wisely used, few things carry more power." (p. 29)

, It's not easy to live with integrity and to do your job with a good attitude. But God gives wisdom to those who ask, and will help you to live your faith, if you pray and ask him!

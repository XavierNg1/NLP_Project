, It must be stone, because stone is ghast proof. Add a crafting table, a chest, and many torches fire maximum best results.
 You can replace torches with this for a more nether lighting.
 These and pig man chicken jockeys are your only source of food.
 Do not upgrade your shelter to this, quartz is not ghast proof.
 This is critical if you ever want to beat the nether.
 These are the first to go because their attack is to swarm, and that is the easiest to kill of all nether animals.
 These swarm also, but have swords to make them more powerful.



The ghast will shoot a fire ball. If you hit it with your sword, the ball will go in the direction you hit it. When the ball hits the ghast (which will take many tries,) The ghast will die.
Alternatively if you have the equipment, shoot the ghost with a bow and arrows. It should take 2-3 arrows from a non-enchanted bow.
 These yellow hostile mobs are third on the list of hardest nether mobs.


Blazes are vulnerable to snowballs. A good tactic is to first weaken the blaze with some snowballs and then finish it off with a sword.
 You will need these later on.
 Use the crafting table to craft things you will need later, such add gold armour from the gold nuggets pigmen dropped. .


Gold equipment has very low durability, so only use gold equipment as a last resort.
 You may need to kill a bunch until you get a wither skull.
 You will need three. Go and kill more skeletons until you have three.
 Good luck!

, Have fun!

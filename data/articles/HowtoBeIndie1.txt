 Why should you anyway? You've only got this one life to live, so live it and spend you life openly loving the things that you love. Wear the things that show who you are, listen to music that expresses your soul, and never pay any attention to the haters. They're just upset that they don't enjoy their life that much.;
, This is really what being indie is all about. It is about liking things and appreciating things that are neglected or that deserve more love than they're getting. From small-time musicians trying to get by to lovingly crafted (rather than lovingly budgeted) films, indie culture is all about finding that diamond in the rough.
 Like the indie movie directors and musicians you admire, make sure to approach life in an independent way. Do the things that make you happy and don't be afraid to deviate from the norm. Dye your hair weird colors because you like the color. Wear clothes that don't match because you like how the patterns clash. Take up a hobby that's considered weird because you don't think it should be weird.
 You can stay totally single, date whoever you want (regardless of what society would think), date more than one person at a time (as long as your significant others agree), and make sure to maintain your independence in any relationship you do have.
 State your opinions, let your appearance express your individual personality, and take actions in your life that express who you are and what you believe in. If it is extremely important to you that employees get fair treatment, volunteer with a worker's rights organization. If you don't like something going on in your country, protest and work to get your issues on the next ballot.

 Start off with strengthening shampoo and conditioner to help your hair grow out. Then, once a week use a deep conditioner. Once you are done washing your hair and get out of the shower, apply detangler and comb your hair out. When you're done, part your hair. Later, apply a defrizzing and shining serum and/or cream. Work it well through your hair and let it air dry to maintain moisture. Use a heat protectant like Tresemme before styling your hair. You can also use a cute headband or style a braid instead!

, Washing too much will lead to dry, thin hair.
 Get it cut in a different style, add a fringe/bangs, dye it, get highlights, etc.

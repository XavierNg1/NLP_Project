 Using white eyeliner, carefully trace the lash line of the upper eyelid. This line should be very wideâ€”up to twice as thick as normal eyeliner would be.


You can technically stop here, but the results might seem overpowering if you're not used to using white eyeliner. If you do choose to use white eyeliner as a solo liner, though, consider making this line somewhat thinner instead of opting for a super thick line.;
, Switch to black eyeliner and carefully draw a second, thin line along the lash line of the upper eyelid. This line should fall at the base of your white line, and it should be about half as thick.The contrast between the black and white liner should make your eyes stand out.
You can use other colors instead of black, but they should still be dark to achieve the same effect. Dark brown, dark gray, or navy blue eyeliners would be other options worth considering.
 Touch up the dark corners of your eyes by drawing a thin v-shape with the white eyeliner, directly around the inner corner. This line should be short, but it should overlap the inner edge of the top and bottom lash lines.


The inner corner is one of the darkest spots of the eye. Applying white eyeliner to this area can minimize this darkness and make your eyes appear more open.
Do not apply black eyeliner to the inner corner. Moreover, it's best to apply the white liner to the inner corner after you've already traced the upper lid in black since you can cover any spots accidentally darkened by the black liner.

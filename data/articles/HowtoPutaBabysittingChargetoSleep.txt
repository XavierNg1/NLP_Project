 This gives the child enough time to calm down. Plan for bedtime to be about 10 minutes earlier than the parents said.;
, Especially if the kid is three or younger, they will probably just crash once a calming activity is done. With the older kids, however, you may have to take a bit of time to slowly coax them to sleep.
 Have them take a shower if they were playing outside, or if the parents have specifically asked them to.
 Don't turn on the TV or a movie; this will only make it harder to get them up to bed.
 Have them climb into bed under the covers so they are ready to sleep. Then, read him/her stories, keeping your tone with the story. (If Mr. Bear is angry, use a real or fake angry voice.)

, Make sure that any lights that need to be on are on, and all closets and beds are check for monsters if that is part of the child's normal routine. Reassure them that their parents will be home soon, and that they need to sleep now. Be calm and collective, and don't shout.
 Keep the volume down on the TV or music, and don't walk around everywhere. This could make the child suspicious or scared. The parents are paying you to care as best you can for their child, so please do!

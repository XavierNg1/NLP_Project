 Get a large, rimmed baking sheet out for the cashews.


You do not need to line or coat the baking sheet in this method; however, if you’re concerned about the cashews sticking, you can line it with parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil. Avoid using oil or nonstick cooking spray since these may impact the cooking process and final flavor.
 A single, even layer will promote even cooking. Try to avoid piling the cashews in multiple layers since they may roast unevenly.
 Remove them from the oven, then stir to distribute the heat evenly.


Depending on your desired level of doneness, you can either stop here or continue roasting the cashews for another 8 to 10 minutes, stopping to stir after four minute intervals.Roasting the cashews for only five minutes will warm them up without impacting the taste and texture much; roasting them for a total of 12 to 15 minutes will give the nuts a more traditional roasted flavor and crunch.
 While the cashews roast, combine the rosemary, cayenne, sugar, salt, and butter in a large bowl. Set the bowl aside for now.


You may skip the cayenne if you’d prefer roasted nuts without a kick of heat.
 Once the cashews are roasted to your desired level of doneness, remove them from the oven. Toss them in the rosemary-butter mixture until all nuts are evenly coated.
 Allow the nuts to cool slightly, for 10 to 15 minutes, tossing occasionally to redistribute the seasoned butter. Serve them immediately once cooled or store them in an airtight container, at room temperature, for up to two weeks.


Note that if you only heated the cashews for five minutes instead of the full 12 to 15, you can serve them immediately while warm instead of waiting for them to cool.

 You'll then need to walk up and down the toweled area until the towels are completely saturated. Take those towels away and replace them with dry towels in the same area.


Keep doing this until the area of the carpet is dry.
You should still check underneath the carpet to make sure the carpet padding and the floor aren't sopping wet, as well.;
, Do not do this with a regular home vacuum. You need a vacuum that is made to soak up water. Most vacuum cleaner sold for home use are for dry cleaning only and are extremely dangerous if used on wet carpets. Do not use your household vacuum cleaner unless it is approved for wet vacuuming.









Vacuum the carpet with the wet vacuum cleaner until you get no more water. The wet vacuum cleaner removes water from the carpet itself, but it may not be able to remove it from the padding if the water has wicked through the carpet backing or soaked in under the edges.
Keep an eye on the fill tank and make sure you dump it before hitting overflow. Depending on the amount of water in the carpet, you may have to dump the tank several times.
 You should use this along with the other two options, because it takes some time to achieve. Grab some ceiling fans, hairdryers, household fans, even a dehumidifier, if you have one.









Keep them pointed towards the moisture until the water begins to dry up.
Again, you'll need to check underneath the carpet to make sure that the floor and carpet padding are not still sopping wet.

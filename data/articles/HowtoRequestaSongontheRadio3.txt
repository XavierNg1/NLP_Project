 Nobody will want to play your request if you comment “you never play good songs so please play Hounds of Love by Kate Bush.” Instead you could compliment them for a specific hour you heard last Thursday after work. If you follow the latter with a song request, your chances are higher of being honored., Getting in touch with a DJ for a request is not the easiest process these days. Have respect for the DJ and know the name of the song.Do not sing or say something like, “it’s the song that goes “nah de dah nah; hey hey hey.” They aren’t taking your call to be quizzed.
 After going through your steps in requesting a song just listen to the station. Part of letting listeners request a song is a ploy for radio stations to gather more listeners.


Be patient and if your song doesn’t play, don’t sweat it. Try again if you still have the urge.

 After creating your Warlock, you will be taken back to the Character Selection screen where you can select the Warlock you just created from the list of your characters and click on “Enter World” to enter the WoW world. Once you access the world for the very first time at level 1, you will start out in a beginner zone.

The specific zone you are in depends on the race you have chosen; however, all starting zones are designed to help new players become familiar with the game.
 Once you log in, you will see large golden text on your screen to the effect of “Click on the character with an exclamation point over his head to take a quest.” So approach and talk to any character with an exclamation point over his or her head to begin a quest.

Similar text will appear on your screen throughout the starting zone, guiding you to gain your first levels.
The starting zones are basically a tutorial, the game will keep showing large golden text on your screen instructing you how to begin playing.
 You will earn experience for each quest you complete, and once you reach a certain amount of experience, you will gain a level.

The amount of experience needed to gain a level increases with each level. You will gain the first several levels within an hour, while at higher levels, it could take you an hour or more to gain one level.
 As you complete quests in the starting zone, you will be offered new quests.

Once you have completed most of the quests, you will be offered quests that take you into another zone.
Quests in World of Warcraft are designed to be a continuous process. Completing all the quests in one zone will give you a quest to go into another zone, up until you have reached the highest level.

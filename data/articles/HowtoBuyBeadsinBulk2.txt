 Look for a store that sell bulk products or will sell items in bulk for you.


The diversity of the product depends on the size of the store.
 This means thinking about what shapes, sizes, colours, etc. will work for your planned project. If you have a purchase plan before arriving at the store, you'll know what you're looking for and won't end up buying a bagful of beads that are totally unrelated to your project. This may sound funny now but when you're confronted by rows and rows of wonderful beads, it may be tempting to splurge without having any idea whether you'll ever use the additional beads.
 It's a good idea to try to negotiate their price with the seller; this won't work all the time but it's worth trying.


Ask the retailer for assistance if you want beads taken out of bags, jars, etc. You may wish to feel the weight, texture, etc. rather than assuming the beads are okay without handling them.
Ask for better lighting if the beads are not clear enough to you. The retailer may have a lamp you can place the beads under.
If you don't see the beads you'd like, or there aren't sufficient quantities, ask the retailer if they will make a special order for you.
 Once home, enjoy beading with the bulk beads you just purchased.

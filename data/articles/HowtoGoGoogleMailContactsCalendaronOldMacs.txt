 This is a fairly quick download.;
, The .dmg download must be opened (either click on the download in your browser or go to the Downloads directory).
 The dialog box from the .dmg makes this really easy -- simply drag-and-drop the Thunderbird icon into the Applications folder icon.
, Open Path, click on Applications, find Thunderbird, drag it to the command bar.
, There is a dialog for this and you need to enter your email address and password -- most of the rest is automatic.
 If you use GMail folders, you will need to subscribe to them to make them visible in Thunderbird. This will also make (optionally) folders for sent, draft, spam, and others visible. You will not have to actually move any email messages as those are actually stored on the GMail server.
 There are two ways to get to Addons -- the Tools menu or the grate icon on the right of the application will get you there.
 Quick access to your Google Calendar.
Google Contacts. Syncs your Google contacts with the Thunderbird address book.
Provider for Google Calendar. Syncs the Google calendar (why this is not built into the Google Calendar Tab?????)
Do a search for "AddressBookTab" and add AddressBookTab. This will add a tab for easy access to the Thunderbird address book (not the same as the Mac's).
 This will be offered in the Extensions window. Extensions don't get completely installed (or deleted) until you do a restart (of just Thunderbird).
 Click each and your Address Book and Calendar will appear as tabs in Thunderbird.

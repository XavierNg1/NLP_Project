 Approaching the horse calmly, as a rider, can also help to keep the horse calm. Before you mount the horse, take several deep, long breaths. This will slow down your heart rate, which will also help your horseâ€™s heart rate to remain steady and calm., Connect with the horse on the ground by talking softly and encouragingly to the horse. You can also put your hand by his head and allow him to get used to your presence. If he appears calm and responsive to you, you can gently stroke him behind his ears and around his neck.If you tend to ride the same horse, you may want to create a grooming routine that you do with the horse before every ride. This will allow you to connect to the horse on the ground and get him used to your presence.
 Take a moment to picture your ride on the horse. Focus on having a calm, relaxing ride on the horse and set an intention. This will help to keep you calm and avoid bringing any emotional or mental struggles you may be having into your ride with the horse., Horses respond well to rhythm and tempo, as they will act as guides for how to move their feet and stay calm. You can count out a tempo as you ride in a soft, calm voice or you can try to find a steady tempo as you ride so your horse can get comfortable.You can also download an Equi-Tempo app, which plays different rhythms for walk, trot, and canter. The app allows you to speed up or slow down the tempo according to your needs as a rider. Put your phone in your pocket and play the app on your phone as you ride so you and the horse can listen to the beat. You can then practice different tempos while riding and note which tempos seem to relax the horse the most.

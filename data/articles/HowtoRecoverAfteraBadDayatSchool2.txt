 Social media has done many positive things to bring people together, but there is a dark side.While recovering from a bad day at school, seeing people from your class on Facebook or other sites could bring you back to feeling down.
 Whether you enjoy drawing, writing, making music, cooking, developing computer code or what-not, just spend some time doing it.It's not like you have to create a masterpiece but try channel your negative emotions into a creative process.


Throughout history artists have channeled their experiences into their art and many times their worst days turn into something beautiful.
 Treat yourself with a favorite meal or dessert. See if your parents are willing to take you out shopping or for a slice of pizza. Parents can help you through issues and typically don't mind getting you a treat in the mean time.
 You may want some friends over to cheer you up, but you may be too exhausted. Sometimes if you're really tired, you may be irritable and end up arguing with your friends. Gauge your emotional state before making plans and choose a compassionate friend.


Going over to a friends house could help you get out of the house and forget about what is getting you down.
 It may sound like a bad idea since you are currently recovering from school, but occupying your brain with homework will help. Mental stimulation can have therapeutic results on your mood. This will also keep you up to date with your schoolwork, allowing you to not fall behind and create more issues at school.


If you get it out of the way early, you won't have anything to feel stressed about the rest of the evening.

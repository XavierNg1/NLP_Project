 Bring healthy rabbit treats, such as carrots and celery. Hold out the treat and say ", come.”

, This will positively reinforce the rabbit's actions. Also, repeat the command as it approaches.
 In the beginning, don’t move very far; just a couple feet will do. Over time can move further and further away from the rabbit.
 If the rabbit follows you without you having to say the command, then simply say it as it approaches. If the rabbit doesn't respond to your command and the promise of a treat, move back to your closer position and repeat.
 During the course of the day, occasionally call your rabbit. Use treats each time for the first few weeks to get your rabbit to associate the command with the treat. When your rabbit comes every time from a close distance, start calling it from further away.
 In time, reward your rabbit with petting and toys, but use food occasionally to keep the behavior strong. This will keep your rabbit coming when called but will also keep your pet healthy.
 Many people suggest using clickers to reinforce association.Each time you feed the rabbit, click the clicker so that the rabbit associates the click with food. Then, when you’re training, a click from the device tells the rabbit a treat is coming.


Try to click right as the desired behavior is happening so the animal knows what it did to get the reward. Give the rabbit a treat or something else they enjoy within a few seconds of the click for each and every time you click, even if you click accidentally. The rabbit will learn that a click means a treat and try to earn clicks.

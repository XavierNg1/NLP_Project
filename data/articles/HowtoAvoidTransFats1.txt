 A key part of healthy eating is to read the nutrition information for every food you buy. Look on the label for how much trans fat is in a product. Ideally, you should be eating a product with zero trans fat.You can find trans fat listed underneath fat and saturated fat.;
, Manufacturers now are required to list trans fat content on their labels. Look for the phrases "partially hydrogenated," "hydrogenated," or "shortening." These types of ingredients contain trans fat.If a product says 0 grams (0.0 oz) of trans fat, it might not be zero. Look for the word "hydrogenated" in the ingredients. This means the food contains trans fat. The FDA allows food manufacturers to list trans fat as 0 grams (0.0 oz) if it contains less than 0.5 grams (0.02 oz) of trans fat. Multiple servings of foods with hydrogenated oils, even if it says zero grams of trans fat, can negatively affect your health.
 When eating out, ask the server what oil is used to prepare your food. If possible, request a healthier oil. Another option is to skip the deep fried foods and opt instead for grilled, steamed, sauteed, or baked.

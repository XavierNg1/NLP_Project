 Your body will sweat in order to reduce its temperature. Being in hot weather will raise your body temperature. If you are outside a lot during hot parts of the year, consider taking regular breaks indoors where it is cooler, or seeking regular refuge in the shade or under an umbrella.


Public areas, such as coffee shops, libraries, and museums, often have air conditioning during hotter months. It is generally acceptable to spend time in these areas in order to relax and beat the heat.
 Though this may seem counter-intuitive, rinsing your hands with cool water can lower your body temperature, preventing excess sweat. Using soap will keep your hands healthy and bacteria-free. Make sure you dry your hands completely with a soft cloth after washing them.


Excess hand washing may make them too dry. Either limit hand washing or consider using a lotion after washing.
An alcohol-based hand sanitizer can also keep your hands cool., Cool showers are a great way to reduce your body heat in hot weather or long days. Take care that you don't shower too much; too much cleansing can leave your skin dry and without essential oils, which may interfere with healthy sweating. Consider using a moisturizer or body lotion, as well as an antiperspirant, after showering.
 Stressful situations can make you sweat more than usual.Control your stress levels through daily exercises such as yoga, meditation, or massage. Consider practicing different relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and even laughter. Mix and match these techniques for your daily life in order to combat different kinds of stress--do yoga in the morning, for instance, and breathe deeply throughout the day.


Warm baths can help you control your stress (and sweat) levels, even if they do raise your body temperature.

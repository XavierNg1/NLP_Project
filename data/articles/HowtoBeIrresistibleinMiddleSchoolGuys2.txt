 A guy who is smart is a major attraction to girls. If you have bad grades, a girl is less likely to be attracted to you because she doesn't want to look bad.


Complete all assignments, homework, and projects on time and to the best of your ability. You are capable of many things if you put in the effort, and that effort is very attractive to girls.
Keep your binder, notebooks, backpack, locker, desk, etc. organized.
Learn more about the topic than required.
Pay attention in class, take notes, and ask questions when you don't understand something.
 If you are into any sport your school offers, take it. Girls love athletes. Even if sports aren't your thing, there are tons of opportunities at your school for you to present yourself in a way you don't often get to.


Whatever you end up doing, work your butt off (sometimes literally!) to be the best you can. Girls love guys who do something special, but they definitely like guys who do it well better.

 In a five gallon bucket, place the entire package of steel wool and pour in the entire container of vinegar. Seal this and allow it to sit for a few days, occasionally opening and stirring it. This waiting period is to allow the acid in the vinegar to fully oxidize the steel. Eventually, the liquid will have an opaque, light brown color. This means it is ready to use.;
, The vinegar in the dye is acidic and eventually it will destroy the integrity of whatever leather you apply it to. The solution to this problem is to use a neutralizing solution. Take the other five gallon bucket, pour in the baking soda and fill it approximately half-way full of water. Stir this until all the baking soda has dissolved. Put the lid on it and set it aside.
 Test the dye by taking a small piece of leather and submerging it in the dye for approximately 2 minutes. Use the piece of wire for this, not your hands. Remove the leather. It should have a very dark matte color to it. If not, there is either a problem with your dye or your leather. If you have used veg tanned un-dyed leather, try adding more steel wool and letting it set for several more days. If it does come out black, good, that means your dye is working and is ready to use on any larger pieces of leather you may want to dye.
 Now, take the piece of leather you have just dyed and submerge it in the bucket filled with the baking soda solution. Leave it in there for several minutes, so that the solution can seep into the leather and then remove it.
 Remove any white residue by washing it with water. Your leather is now ready to be made into whatever you would like.

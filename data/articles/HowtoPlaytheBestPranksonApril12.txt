 One good, easy prank is to put something under a person's pillow. Messy substances work best for this prank, such as marshmallow cream or shaving cream. When the person gets ready to go to sleep, they'll stick their hands under the pillow and find a silly surprise., Alarm clocks are often used to prank people because you can set them to go off at a later time. One way to use alarm clocks is to gather a bunch of them and hide them around someone's room. Set them to go off at different times during the night.Another option that takes more commitment is to make someone early for something. For instance, if your spouse gets up before dawn to go to work, you can set all the clocks and smartphones in the house to several hours earlier. When your spouse gets up at his or her "normal" time, it will actually be hours earlier.
 Secretly make a copy of documents important to a friend or coworker. Hide the original away. In front of the person, "accidentally" spill coffee on it.This prank works especially well if it's something that's not easily reproduced, such as a birth certificate, car title, or something that was notarized.
It also works well to play it on a friend who doesn't have easy access to a printer and who has printed off a paper for class already.
 This prank takes some time and commitment, but the shock value is worth it. Simply buy a bunch of sticky notes, and cover the entire car with them. The driver will have to remove them before he or she can leave.It's maybe best not to play this prank when it will make someone late to work, school, or another commitment. It can take a while to remove all of the sticky notes, so allow ample time.

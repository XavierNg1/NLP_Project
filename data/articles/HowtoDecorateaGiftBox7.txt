 Decoupage is a great way to create a unique, layered look. It is ideal for those who want a vintage or shabby-chic look to their box. Here's what you'll need:

Plain gift box
Solid colored or patterned paper
Scissors
Mod Podge or decoupage glue
Foam brush

, If your paper has designs on it, such as butterflies, flowers, or birds, then cut around the designs. If your paper is solid colored, you can cut your own shapes, such as hearts and stars., This will allow you to fix any mistakes. It will also allow you to experiment with different shapes and layering until you get the look you want. Once you put the paper down onto the Mod Podge, it will be difficult to move it without ruining it., You will be working on one side of the box at a time so that your work surface does not get all sticky.

If your box comes with a lid, take the lid off and work on it separately.
 You will be working in small areas at a time so that the Mod Podge does not dry out before you get to it.

If you can't find any Mod Podge or decoupage glue, you can make your own by mixing one part white school glue with one part water.
 You can place the shapes down individually, or overlap them to create new designs. For example, you can paste a flower shape down onto some leaf shapes. If you are overlapping shapes, be sure to coat the bottom shape with Mod Podge so that the top shape will stick.
 Once the glue dries, flip or rotate the box and continue decoupaging pieces of paper onto it., This will help seal in your work. You can use the same finish that you were using before (such as gloss, matte, or satin). You can also try using a glittery one for some extra sparkle., If you put the lid on too soon, it will get stuck to the box, and the receiver will have a hard time opening it.

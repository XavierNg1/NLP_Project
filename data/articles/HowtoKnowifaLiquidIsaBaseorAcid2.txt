 An indicator is a chemical (usually a type of dye) that will change colors predictably when exposed to an acid or base. Litmus will turn from blue to red in the presence of acid and from red to blue in the presence of a base. Red cabbage juice contains chemicals known as anthocyanins that turn red when exposed to acid, blue when exposed to bases, and yellow when exposed to a strong base.Your indicator can be in a liquid form, or you can use strips of paper coated with the indicator, known as pH strips.
 If you choose to use pH strips, simply dip the strip into the liquid. Allow the strip to air dry momentarily. If you choose to use a liquid indicator, put the indicator in a clear container (so that you do not distort the color). Add your liquid to the indicator by dropping it in with a dropper., Whether you use the pH strips or the liquid indicator, the color change should be the same. Some indicators, such as litmus, will only tell you if your solution is an acid or a base. Other indicators, such as red cabbage juice, can be compared to a universal indicator that will give you an approximate pH range of your liquid.

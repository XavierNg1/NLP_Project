 Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and your feet about hip-width apart. Your feet should be flat on the floor. Pick up your right leg, and turn the foot towards your other knee. Rest your right ankle across your left thigh. Relax for a moment., Reach your hands so that they are grasping your left quad. You will need to thread your right hand between your right and left thighs. Lift your left leg up, and pull it gently toward your chest.Holding on to the back of your leg not only supports it, it also helps to stretch out the muscle more.If can't hold your leg easily, you can also use a strap or towel to support it. Just wrap it around the leg, and grab the ends., After a few seconds of holding the position and relaxing, try to pull your leg in slightly more. Once you've held it for 30 seconds, lower your leg back to the ground., You should feel a stretch in your right and then left hip. The muscle you feel stretching is the piriformis muscle, that runs through your buttocks, often contributing to lower back pain.You can do a more advanced version of this stretch while standing. Find a counter or table that is at about hip height. Rotate your right leg and place it on top of the table. Make sure you are right up against the table. Keep your back straight and lean forward for 10 deep breaths. Repeat with the opposite leg.

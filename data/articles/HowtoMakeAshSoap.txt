Homemade lye comes from wood ashes and can be made by making an ash hopper and allowing the lye to leech out of the ashes. The ashes are added to the hopper and periodically soaked with water. The lye is collected as it seeps out of the hopper. This lye is less caustic than store-bought lye and is composed of potassium hydroxide.






Commercial lye is composed of sodium hydroxide and may be purchased as granules. To properly make soap, the lye should be pure sodium hydroxide and there should be no flecks of gray or black on the crystals.


You may choose to render your own fat from butchered animals by cleaning the lard from pigs or the tallow from cattle. The rendering of fat is done by putting equal amounts of lard and water in a pot over an outside flame and boiling until all fats are melted. Remove from the heat, and add an amount of water equal to the first. Allow this to sit overnight. The hardened fat that forms will clean of all impurities. This may also be done with leftover cooking grease.






You may also choose to buy purified lard from the store.






Lard may be either animal or vegetable based.

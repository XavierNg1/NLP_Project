 Offer to play (for free) at benefits, auctions, fairs, wherever there is a public audience. Keep an eye out for talent shows, too; agents are often looking for a band to represent. This doesn't necessarily ensure publicity and an agent, but it will definitely help.;
, Go on their website (if they don't have one, they're usually not even worth their representation) and find information about auditioning for an agent.
 You may have to send in a recording or audition tape. You may even perform live at their studio. Check or call about what you need to bring.
 Don't sit by the phone waiting. This may be the toughest part. Even if you think they've forgotten about you (they haven't!) wait a few weeks before you call again.

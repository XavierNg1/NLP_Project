, You can buy this commercially, or you can just cut strips of yellow butcher paper. If you have a crimping tool, go ahead and use that to dress it up a bit.
 This will be the centerpiece of your display, so make it nice and big. You can copy from the one you see here, or make it simpler if you like. Just be sure your menorah has nine candle holders in a row, one for each of the eight days of Hanukkah and one to hold the Shamus (or lighting candle) which should appear in the center.
 You can use any color you like; to make them just a bit more realistic, you can taper them ever so slightly at the top.
 You can make them any size you like. Then with a magic marker, draw on each side of a dreidel, either a Nun or Gimmel or Hay or Shin, which are the only Hebrew letters to be found on a dreidel. Cut these out and put them up on the board, attaching a Popsicle stick to each dreidel to represent the spinner.
 Attach a handle measuring 1 inch (2.5 cm) by 10 inches (25.4 cm). This will represent the latke pan. To make the latkes, you can simply crush a paper towel, wet it a little bit, shape it into something like a pancake, and staple it (in a few spots) to the pan.
 Affix to your display.
, To mimic the example shown here, affix the gold letters first, and then affix the red letters slightly askew over the gold letters to create a bit of drop-shadow effect.

 Black and green tea have antibacterial properties and can help sooth an irritated or itchy eye. Use organic tea to ensure your cat is not being exposed to any chemicals or additives. Steep the two tea bags in hot water for three to four minutes.Remove the tea bags and set them on a clean paper towel. This will allow them to cool.
 You will need to keep your cat very still for this method, as the tea bags will need to sit on her eyes for a few minutes. You may try sitting your cat in your lap and placing a towel over head. Then, you can adjust the towel until just her eyes are exposed.


You may also ask a friend or a partner to help you hold your cat still. Sometimes having an extra pair of hands to assist you can make keeping your cat still much easier.
 Once you have your cat in a static position with her eyes exposed, place each tea bag on her eyes. Make sure they are not too hot before you put them on her eyes as you do not want to burn or irritate her.Let the tea bags sit on your cat’s eyes for one to two minutes.
If there is any crust around your cat’s eyes, the tea bags will help to loosen it and make it easier to wipe off.
 Remove the tea bags. Then, use a clean, soft cloth dipped in warm water to wipe away any remaining gunk. The gunk should come off easily due to the warmth of the tea bags.

 You will want to have a place to set up a tripod. Things that you might look for are:


A central stationary object; poles in the water for the video
Something moving; the water around the poles. The long exposure gives the water a very unique look;
, You don't want to hit the tripod at all during the photo. Not having the strap on, you don't have to worry about it hitting the tripod or causing the camera to move.
 You want as much as possible to be in focus.
 Whatever is the lowest that it will go.
 Make sure that it is already in position.
, You have to do this before you add the neutral density filter, because it is too dark to focus through.
, You can use gaffer's tape or buy a cover for your camera.
 Have some way of marking time and wait for the right time.
 This lets the camera know that you are done with the image.

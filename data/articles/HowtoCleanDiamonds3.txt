 Take your diamond jewelry off when you are performing arduous tasks. Diamond jewelry can suffer from wear and tear over time. The best thing you can do to counter this is to be mindful about when you wear your diamonds and when you don’t.Try to take your diamonds off before doing things like washing the dishes, going to the gym, working outdoors, or bathing.
 If you aren’t wearing the diamonds regularly and you want to store them for safe keeping, make sure that the diamonds aren’t touching each other. Diamond is one of the hardest materials on earth, so it’s quite easy for these gems to scratch other jewelry or other diamonds.Wrap each diamond individually in tissue paper to keep it safely separated from any other item it may scratch.
You can also keep each diamond in its own jewelry box container, or a jewelry box that has separated areas for different jewelry items.
 In order to keep your diamonds safe and secure while you are traveling, be sure to use a travel case intended for jewelry items. These items are typically made out of leather or another sturdy fabric and keep your jewelry safe while you are on the go.Typically, these types of case are either hard-backed with zipper enclosures, or they roll up to keep the jewelry items stationary.
Remember to wrap diamonds and individual diamond items in tissue paper to prevent scratching or other damage.

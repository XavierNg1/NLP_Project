 Just because you kissed someone doesn’t mean that they will assume you want to start a relationship with them. Shortly after the kiss is a good time to establish what you are hoping for. Depending on what you want you could say something like :


That was nice.
Can I see you again sometime soon?
Are you free to go out to a movie next Thursday?
Shall we get out of here?
Do you want to come back to my place?
I really enjoyed that. We should do it more often.
 This means both your boundaries and the boundaries of the person you want to kiss. Just because you initiated the kissing, doesn’t mean that you’re obligated to take it further if your partner indicates that they’re interested. Similarly, just because someone is willing to kiss you, or even enjoys kissing you, it doesn’t mean that they will want to take it further.
 Doing so would be an aggressive sexual advance. If you persist when the person you are trying to kiss has made it clear that he/she does not want to be kissed, then it becomes harassment,and can subject you to legal action.To know whether or not someone doesn’t want to be kissed, pay attention to their body language, and how they are interacting with you as well as any verbal cues. For more information on subtle cues that can let you know the person you want to kiss doesn’t want to be kissed, you can look at How to Know if a Girl Wants to be Kissed. This advice applies almost equally well to people of any gender.

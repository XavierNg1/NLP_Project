 Open a web browser on your computer or laptop, and visit the Google Maps web-based application.;
, Once you have the Google Maps on view, click the target icon on the lower right-hand corner of the page to make Google Maps identify your location.
 Once you clicked the target icon, a pop-up message will appear on the top left-hand corner of the page. Simply click the “Allow” or “Share” button you see on the pop-up to allow your browser to retrieve your location information defined by your Internet service provider.
 After retrieving your location data, Google Maps will place a pointer on your current location on the map. Check to see if the pointer is placed correctly; otherwise, repeat the previous steps to retrieve and correct your location again.

Some people prefer to wash newly-purchased clothing before wearing it for the first time. If this sounds like you, remember to remove all of the tags and stickers from the clothes before preparing to wash them. If the clothes have been worn before their first washing, the tags already will have been removed, making this step unnecessary.

To set the color in your clothes, it is essential that they are washed in water that is as cold as possible. Adjust the water temperature settings on your machine before placing the clothing inside it. If you are especially concerned about the clothing, consider turning off the water heater for the time being. This will ensure that the water is very cold.


During the first washing of new clothes, they should be washed either alone or with other clothing that is of a very similar color.


In food, salt acts as a preservative, extending the shelf life of many products. Similarly, when used correctly, salt can maintain vibrant colors in clothes. Add 1/4 of a cup of iodized salt to the washing machine, directly on top of the clothing.


Consider using a gentle to medium speed setting on the washing machine during this first bout of washing.


As discussed above, heat is notorious for leaching color from clothing. Because of this, it is important that clothes are dried without the use of excessive heat. Air dry your clothes as much as possible, either by placing them on a drying rack, clothesline, or simply by hanging them on a shower curtain. If you must use a dryer, put the setting on tumble dry. This will limit the amount of heat to which your clothing is exposed. Then hang the clothing immediately when the dryer finishes the cycle.

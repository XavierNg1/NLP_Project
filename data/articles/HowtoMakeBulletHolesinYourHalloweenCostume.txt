 If you want a through and through shot, lay it flat; if you want just an entry wound, you'll want to stretch it out so there's only one layer of fabric (i.e. just the front).;
, Make sure to put it in far enough that you can't pull it out by hand.
 This will create a small round tear in the fabric.
 Make sure to go in the direction the bullet would travel (so push in on one side, out on the other; this will make it more realistic).
 Use a small makeup applicator or paint brush, and consider what the blood drips and smears would look like.


In a sweater or jacket, the blood would just absorb into the fabric.
If the bullet holes are in a lighter material or closer to the skin, like this tee shirt, the blood would drip some before absorbing.
 Depending on the type of fake blood you used, you may or may not be able to wash the clothing afterwards, or you may want to dirty them up if you're doing a zombie or someone back from the grave.

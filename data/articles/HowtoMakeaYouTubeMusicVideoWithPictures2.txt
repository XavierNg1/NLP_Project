 If you want to use Youtube's pre-made software, you need to know that it is illegal to post the content of others (such as their music or photos) for your own personal gain. However, making a family slide-show or a private music video is completely legal.


You cannot use your own song when making this music video, you can only use one provided by the YouTube Library.
 Click on "Upload" in the corner of the screen and select "Create" under Photo Slideshow.
 You'll have a window pop up that let's you pick as many photos as you want. Add in your shots, all of them, without worrying about order yet.


You can automatically pull in any Google + albums you have made as well., You can simply drag and drop them to put them in place.
 Under "Audio" you should choose the song that you want in the background. Know, however, that you can only use the music provided to you in the YouTube library. You cannot upload your own songs.

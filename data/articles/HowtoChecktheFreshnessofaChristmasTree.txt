 Does it appear fresh, healthy, and in good shape?;
, If the tree is fresh, the needles should stay in place and not break. It should be hard to pull them off the branches.
 If so, it's definitely fresh.
 Expect some needles to fall off but if a lot fall off, move to another tree. One that loses a lot of needles is no longer fresh and could be dry enough to be a fire hazard.

 Operators do not use it.. The #1 rule in room clearing is never go in alone. However, maybe all your teammates are out, or away on other missions. For One-Man room clearing, here's what you do:

, As you move at different angles to the door, you are "slicing the pie". Keep your gun at the same place as your eye; not further in, not closer to your body. The point is if you see a bad guy on your section of the pie he doesn't see you first. Keep slicing the pie in baby steps. If you can somehow throw in a flashbang then you could then slice the pie much faster. See Clear-a-Building-with-a-Firearm for more techniques.

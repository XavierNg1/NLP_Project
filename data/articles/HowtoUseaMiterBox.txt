 Miter boxes are small and lightweight, and so present a risk of sliding around if used without mounting. To steady your miter box, first find a piece of scrap wood (3/4 inch (19 mm) plywood works well) that is slightly bigger than the box. Place the miter box onto the scrap wood base, and then secure it by drilling screws through the 2 holes in the base of the miter box. For further security, place the wood base on a scrap of carpet pad; this will keep the assembly from sliding on your work surface.
 First, make sure the board to be cut will fit in the miter box. If possible, it is always best to cut the board in a vertical position rather than laying it flat. Make the needed measurement on the board and then mark the position of the cut with a pencil., Place the board into the miter box, and line up the pencil mark with the appropriate guide slot. Hold the board against the front fence with a clamp or your non-dominant hand to steady it., Keeping the board steady with your other hand, place a backsaw into the 2 guide slots and lower the blade onto the board. Back-saws cut on the pull stroke, so make sure that your first stroke pulls the blade towards you. Continue sawing the board using smooth, continuous strokes, keeping the saw in the guide slots at all times., After making the cut, remove the board from the miter box and discard the scrap end. If there are any rough edges to the cut, you can sand them smooth using sandpaper. Sand using coarse-grit sandpaper first, and then switch to a finer grit.

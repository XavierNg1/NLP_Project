 It might seem like flint is difficult to find, but you generally just need to know where to look. In some areas, like the Ozarks of Missouri, you can find chert lying all over the ground. That is because flint and chert are hard, durable rocks that are so resistant to weathering they remain intact long after the surrounding rocks have weathered away into the soil.You can search along the freshwater shores or riverbeds.Flint is very durable and resistant to chemicals, so it often collects in the remaining soils as surrounding carbonate rocks erode.While rocks like limestone erode and fine soil is carried downstream, small pebble deposits of flint and chert collect along the shores.
Try other locations where there is a large variety of rocks present, such as a construction site or along a gravel road. Many times rocks are harvested from riverbeds for construction from all over so you might be surprised to find chert or flint pebbles just down the block.;
, If you live near an area that was once populated by tribes of Native Americans, you might have a good chance of locating flint fragments around that area.


Flint was an ideal choice for creating tools and weapons. Flint can be made to form a blade that is actually sharper than steel, with a tip that is just the width of a few molecules.If you find an arrowhead or sharp rock near a old tribal ground, you found some flint.
 Flint often forms as nodules inside pieces of chalk or limestone.So in addition to looking for pieces of flint, look for larger rocks that may contain several pieces of flint. Bust them open and see what you find.


Look for discolorations on a piece of limestone. Usually flint or chert nodules will be a slightly darker shade than the surrounding limestone.You can break these pieces out with the use of some tools and collect the flint.
Grab an iron hammer and bust open some smaller rocks. If you notice some sparks when the hammer contacts the rock, there is likely some flint or quartz inside.

 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit or 180 degrees Celsius. Dust an eight-inch cake pan with flour and spread melted butter or oil over it using a pastry brush.
 In a mixing bowl, sift the flour, baking soda, and baking powder until the dry ingredients are light and fluffy.
 Pour the milk, salt, and sugar into the dry ingredients. Blend with a hand blender or electric blender on medium speed.
 Pour the melted butter and vinegar into the cake batter and mix again until well-combined. The cake batter should start to look glossy.
 Use a rubber spatula to scrape up all the cake batter into the cake pan.
 Place the cake pan into the oven. Have it bake for about 25-30 minutes, which is when the cake springs back when you touch it, and a toothpick comes out dry when you poke the cake.
 Flip the cake pan upside down on a wire rack. To make the cake easier to flip, circle a knife around it. It should pop out. Have the cake cool for about five minutes.
 Using your favorite frosting and icing, frost your cake to your liking. You can also add toppings such as sliced fruit, sprinkles, nuts, chocolate chips, and coconut flakes.

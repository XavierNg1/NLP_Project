 If you have a friend or family member who is distressed about unfinished business with someone who has passed away, offer to use your abilities to help him or her.


During the s√©ance or trance period, note that as a medium you should not ask too many questions of the person you are helping. A good medium never asks the client to tell them the name of the deceased or any details; otherwise, it is not a valid reading. It is up to you to validate the deceased loved one's name, occupation in life, birth date, physical description, how they passed, and so on.
Remember that doing a psychic reading is a big responsibility. It can be a very emotional process for all parties involved.
 It is possible to have a very successful career as a psychic medium once you're confident in your abilities. Build a website to advertise your services. Set up a room in your house or rent a space to be used for the purpose of holding sessions with clients.


Be sure to incorporate your small business according to the laws where you live.
Talk to other mediums about the business models that have worked for them, including how much they charge for each reading.
Participate in psychic fairs and conferences. Print business cards and pass them out at psychic fairs and conferences, or sign up to set up your own table.

 The bracelet should have a post at one end and an open clasp at the other end. Rest the post inside the clasp, positioning it inside the curved groove of the clasp.


The post consists of a vertical rod and a horizontal head. Make sure that the head of the post sits on the inside of the clasp. If it remains on the outside, the bracelet will not close properly.
 Place your thumb against one back side of the open clasp and your index finger against the other back side.


Use your hand to hold the rest of the bracelet steady while you work.
 Bring your thumb and index finger together, pushing the clasp closed around the post in the process. Once it snaps shut, the bracelet should be securely closed.

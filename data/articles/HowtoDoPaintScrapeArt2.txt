 Cover the entire surface of a heavyweight paper with bright pastel colors. You can create any design, from rainbow stripes to polkadots. Just make sure you color the entire sheet of paper.For best results, press hard on the pastels when you color the paper.
If you don’t have pastels, you can also use brightly colored crayons., After you’ve colored the paper, paint the entire surface with black India ink.Give the paint time to dry after you’ve covered the whole surface.


If you don’t have India ink, try using black poster paint. Pour poster paint into a small bowl and mix in a drop of dish soap to help it stick to the pastel layer., Use a paperclip or popsicle stick to scrape lines into the black ink and reveal the bright pastel layer below. You can etch any shapes or designs you’d like. Try making images like stars and planets, a city skyline, flowers, or fireworks.Try experimenting with the paperclip and popsicle stick to create lines with varying thickness and fine details.

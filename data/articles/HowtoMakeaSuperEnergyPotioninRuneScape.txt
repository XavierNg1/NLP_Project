Collect an avantoe herb. Invest in clean avantoe for faster times or if you are planning to make a huge batch. Grimy avantoes are a drop of certain NPCs and monsters, as well as farming.
Purchase a vial. Acquire water-filled vial packs to save you time. Any unused vials can be stored in your bank for later usage.
Collect a mort myre fungi. Use a blessed silver sickle on special dead logs around the Mort Myre Swamp and cast bloom on them.
 This will create a "Avantoe Potion (unf)".
 This will create a three dose super energy potion.

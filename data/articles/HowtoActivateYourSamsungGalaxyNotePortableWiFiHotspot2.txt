 If your plan does not support tethering or mobile hotspots, there are some alternative options available on the Google Play Store.


One of the most popular tethering apps is Klink. This only supports USB tethering, meaning you connect your Note to a laptop or desktop via USB to share the internet.
FoxFi is a popular Wi-Fi hotspot app that works without needing root access for your Note. Since FoxFi is not supported by carriers, there's a good chance that it won't work properly, but if it does it can save you a lot of money on your monthly phone bill.
 Once you start your hotspot app, you'll be able to configure it much like you would an official hotspot. This includes setting up a network name (SSID) as well as creating a password.


Don't include any personal information in the name (SSID).
Make sure that the password is strong so that unauthorized users cannot access the hotspot.
If you're using Klink, there's no configuration necessary. Simply connect your Note to your computer using a USB cable and tap "Start".
 After configuring your network, turn the hotspot on from the app. This will allow your Note to start broadcasting a wireless signal that other devices can connect to.
 Now that your Note is broadcasting a wireless signal, you can connect your other devices to it.


Open the wireless network list on the device that you want to connect to the hotspot.
Select the name you set for the wireless network and enter the password.
After a moment, the device will be connected to the internet.
 When you have multiple devices connected to the hotspot, they can eat through your data quite quickly. This is especially a concern when laptops are connected that are visiting the desktop versions of websites, which aren't optimized to conserve data.


Open the "Data Usage" section of the Settings menu.
Use the slider to set a limit on how much data can be used.

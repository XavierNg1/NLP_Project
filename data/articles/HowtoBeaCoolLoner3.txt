 The key is to be friendly, but not overtly so. When everyone is your friend, you're “cool.” When no one is your friend, you're a “loner.” Therefore it makes sense to have only a handful of close friendships, while also being well-liked by your peers in a general sense.


If you’re unfriendly and turn most people off, the “loner” reputation is going to stick, but definitely not the “cool” one.
Being a disliked loner is an unpleasant position to put yourself in, so try to avoid it.
 Find a small group of people who you identify well with, and who make you feel good about yourself. Even having just one or two people in your inner circle is perfectly fine.Make these special people your closest friends and confidants.
Everyone needs a close friend or two, even loners.
 There is nothing cool about completely isolating yourself, and the person it will most harm is you. It’s not good for your mental health and will most likely destroy any confident or happy vibe you were trying to put out into the world.Don’t miss out on the social experience of life completely.Find a balance that works for you.

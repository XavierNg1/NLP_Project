 For business suits, the classic attire can be rather boring. Consider switching up your business look by wearing a blouse that is your favorite print of color. Adding in this variety can keep your outfit looking appropriate and smart, while also letting your personal fashion sense shine through., Blazers are a great way to embellish a smart casual outfit, but if you want to go for a softer look, consider wearing a colorful cardigan or wrap sweater.The color of the cardigan can be a statement color, or it can be an accent color to an otherwise muted-toned outfit.


If you are always chilly, a turtleneck is also a viable option for a smart casual sweater look.
 In many business settings, pantsuits are a norm. Switch up the norm by updating your normal pantsuits for ones with slimmer silhouettes. Slimmer silhouettes can flatter your figure while staying modest, and you can mix and match your pantsuit combinations., Dressing stylish everyday might be exhausting, but when in doubt (and running low on work appropriate outfits) always wear at least one statement piece.That means, if your dress is going to be pretty boring for the day, make sure your shoes, or you necklace, or your belt is making a fashion statement.


Your statement piece could be colorful, or printed, or embellished. This is the easiest way to make sure your outfit is incorporating the “smart” part of smart casual.

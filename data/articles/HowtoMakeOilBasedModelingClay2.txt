 Break off pieces of beeswax and place them in the pot. You should use 100g or 1 8 by 11 inch (20 by 28 cm) sheet of beeswax.
 Stir it with a wooden spoon until it is no longer lumpy.
 (30ml) of baby oil, 3 tbsp. (44ml) of petroleum jelly and 2 tbsp. (30ml) of coconut oil. Stir them together for 30 seconds. Turn off the heat.
 If you want to split the batch into different colors, pour them onto different trays.
 Test the texture with your fingers. Make adjustments to the texture as needed.


If the modeling clay feels too firm, return it to the pot on low. Add more lime, more baby oil and more petroleum jelly in small amounts until it starts to loosen up. Stir well and pour it onto the sheet again.
If the clay feels crumbly, it needs more wax and coconut oil. Melt some wax in the double boiler again. Add some coconut oil and place your crumbly wax in the pot. Stir until it is combined.
 If it is still warm, use your plastic gloves to handle the clay.

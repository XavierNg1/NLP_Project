 Go out and buy Snagit or download the 30-day trial for free.;
, The software is able to take a picture or video of any part of your computer screen, or the whole thing.
 If Snagit isn't open, open it first and then find the Snagit icon.
, Your general screen should dim, and depending on where you move your mouse, various parts of the screen should become lighter. This light area is the selected portion for the screencast.



If you move your mouse over a particular window or area of the screen and it goes bright, you can click once to automatically select that whole area (usually a particular window or portion of the window, which the software picks out automatically).
If you want to create a custom selection rather than one of the defaults, click your mouse at one corner of the area, hold the button down while you drag the box to the right size and shape, and then release the button.
 If you're taking a video screen capture, press record to start the recording. Wait for the countdown and then complete whatever your desired actions are on the screen. If the audio is on, you can also narrate and the video will record the noise picked up by the computer's microphone. When you're done, press the stop button.


If you're capturing just an image, this step isn't relevant; the image will open right after you release the mouse button.
 Your screen capture image or video will open up in the Snagit software. From there, you can edit it (if it's an image); you can crop the image, blur particular areas, and add arrows, shapes, icons, and text. When you're happy with the result, you can select one of the various options for saving it to your desktop, copying it to your clipboard, emailing it to someone, or sharing it online (through screencast.com or one of the alternative social media/web options).

 An easy way to keep Velcro from becoming clogged with dust, pet hair, and other airborne debris is by keeping the strips fastened as much as possible. After removing shoes, clothing, or bags with Velcro closures, re-fasten the closures until the next use. You should also keep Velcro fastened when washing garments.;
, Another way to decrease the amount of dust that forms on Velcro fasteners is by spraying them occasionally with an antistatic spray. This reduces the static charge of the Velcro, which will discourage it from attracting dust.
 The rougher side of the fastener containing the small hooks tends to get clogged more easily with dirt and hair. A simple way to clean this side is by running another hooked Velcro fastener against it a few times. This tends to lift the debris to the surface of the 2 fasteners, where it can be gently lifted away by hand.
 If you can't find a spare piece of Velcro to use for cleaning, you can try using a small knitting and crocheting tool called a crochet hook. Drag the crochet hook through the hooked fastener of the Velcro, and the small groove in the hook will drag hair and dust along with it.
 If you still cannot remove some of the debris from the hooked side of the Velcro, you can try pinching and removing the offending material using tweezers.
 If the softer, looped side of the Velcro is soiled, you can clean it using duct tape. Wrap a length of tape around your hand, securing it using its own adhesive. Blot the tape gently against the Velcro several times, lifting the dust and debris away.
 Velcro can be washed using a mild soap and warm water if desired. This will clean dust out of the fasteners, as well as helping to remove any odors that may be lingering on the Velcro. You can wash the Velcro in your sink using dish soap and allow it to air dry afterwards.

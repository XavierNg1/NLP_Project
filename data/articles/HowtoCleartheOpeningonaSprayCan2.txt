 Remove the clogged nozzle from the spray paint can. Place the nozzle in a small dish of paint thinner. Allow it to soak over night.


The paint thinner should remove or loosen the clog.
When you handle paint thinner, wear protective gloves.
 Put on a pair of protective gloves and remove the nozzle from the paint thinner. Rinse the nozzle under water to clear out the softened paint.


After rinsing the nozzle, you may carefully insert a needle into the nozzle to remove the paint. Please note, using a needle may distort or widen the nozzle’s tube., Remove the nozzle from the can of aerosol lubricant and replace it with the clogged spray paint nozzle. Press down on the nozzle to force the aerosol lubricant through it. Repeat until the clog is cleared.


If the nozzle is still clogged, remove it from the aerosol lubricant. Apply the lubricant directly to the nozzle’s interior and exterior opening. Return the nozzle to the can and try to force the lubricant through it. Repeat as needed.

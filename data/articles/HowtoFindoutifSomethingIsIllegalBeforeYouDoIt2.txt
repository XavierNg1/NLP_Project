 Lawyers receive extensive legal training and will either know if something if illegal, or have the resources to investigate and find out. If you're having trouble finding out if something is legal or not, try asking a lawyer.Make sure whichever lawyer you consult operates in the area you're planning on taking this particular action, since laws change based on the particular locality.
If you know a lawyer personally or have on in your family, use that resource.
If you don't personally know a lawyer, see if any firms in your area offer free consultations. Lawyers will sometimes give a free introductory consultation, hoping to acquire new clients.
 While police don't receive the same legal training that lawyers do, they're very well acquainted with local laws and can probably answer any questions you might have.


Almost all police departments have a "Contact Us" section on their website, which will direct you to the phone number of the precinct. Utilize this to ask the local department if something is illegal.
 Even if local laws aren't printed online, they will be available at city/town hall or the courthouse. You can call this location and inquire with the staff in the office if they are aware if something is illegal. They may know off the bat, or be able to provide you with the resources you need to find out.

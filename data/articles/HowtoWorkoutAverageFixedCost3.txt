 Calculating a realistic AFC can be helpful to understanding your product's potential profitability. Before beginning a new project, try doing a break-even analysis to better understand how AFC, AVC, and price affect your timeline to profitability. In general, the most important thing is that your product's price is always set above your AVC (average variable cost). The excess is then used to cover fixed costs.AFC goes down as production goes up and thus it's easy to be misled into thinking that producing as much product as possible (while maintaining total fixed costs) is a way to profitability.
 You can also use average fixed costs in determining where to cut expenses. Cutting expenses may be necessary due to market conditions or may be simply used to increase profitability. If fixed costs make up a large part of your total cost, more so than variable costs, it may be a good idea to consider places where you could cut back. For example, you might think about cutting down on electricity usage with more efficient lighting or manufacturing equipment. Using AFC would allow you to see how this change could affect your profit per product.


Reducing fixed costs provides you with more "operating leverage" (more benefits from greater production numbers). Doing this will also lower the sales needed to reach your break-even point.
 Economies of scale is a benefit that comes from large amounts of production. Essentially, by producing more, you are able to lower your fixed cost per item and increase your profit margin. By finding AFC at various levels of production, you are able to price out how much more profitable you could be by producing more. You can then compare this to the price of reaching this level of production (maybe in addition manufacturing space or machine purchases) to determine whether or not an expansion would be profitable.

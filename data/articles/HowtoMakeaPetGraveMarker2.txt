 Go to the garden decoration section. Here you're bound to find a wide array of possible items that would make ideal grave markers. Some examples include:


Statues, figurines and metallic cut-outs of animals (you could even match the animal to your loved pet's own species)
Flowerbed decorations such as flower cut-outs, mushroom statues,
Solar lights
Baubles, glass beads, wind chimes, etc. If the items need hanging, you'll need either a post or tree branch to hang the items from.
 If the decoration has space and the surface is appropriate, you might consider painting or marking the pet's name onto it.

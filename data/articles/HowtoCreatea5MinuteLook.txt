 Put a thin line of matte white powder down the center of your nose to make it look thinner. Make a fish face and put bronzer in the hollow of you cheeks and sweep downwards.
 Put blush on the apples of your cheeks and sweep to your temples. Depending on your face shape, you could just keep it on your apples of your cheeks.

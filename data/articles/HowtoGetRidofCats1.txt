 Feeding unaltered cats will keep them coming back to your property and encourage population expansion.


Talk to your neighbors about whether people are feeding the unaltered cats. If people who live nearby are feeding them, it could be causing the population in your neighborhood to get out of hand.
If you do feed cats, put the food well away from your house. Don't place it at your front door unless you want to encourage cats to collect there.;
, Cats can subsist on very little, so it may be impossible to completely remove their food sources in your area. You can start by making sure your trash isn't overflowing from the can, and that you secure the can with a tight-fitting lid.


Talk to your neighbors to make sure everyone agrees to use tight-fitting lids to seal their trash cans.
Restaurant dumpsters are often sources of food for stray and feral cats, especially because they're frequently left open and only emptied once they're completely full. If a dumpster in your neighborhood seems to be attracting cats, talk to the restaurant owner about strategies for keeping the trash more secure.
 Cats seek a warm, dry space for shelter from the elements, and if they're unable to find a nesting place, they will move on to the next neighborhood. Fence off the area under your porch or deck, and make sure your shed door is tightly closed. Cover any small openings under porches, decks, or foundations.


If you notice cats gathering in a particular place in your area, figure out what they're using for shelter and block access to it.
Plywood and chicken wire are inexpensive, yet effective, materials for covering openings.

 You can summon one by defeating a Goblin Invasion in Hardmode to acquire a Pirate Map and then using it. A Pirate will then spawn.
 A Truffle then spawns. This house can't be a burrow, it has to be on top of the grass in a Mushroom biome., A bound Wizard will spawn. Talk to him to unbind him and leave him. He will eventually spawn in your house., We recommend the Destroyer, as it's the easiest to spawn and beat. You can spawn it by using a Mechanical Worm, which is crafted from 6 Souls of Night, 15 Vertabrae/Rotten Chunk, and 5 Iron Bars at a Mythril or Orithcalum Anvil. After one is defeated, the Steampunker will spawn in an available house., Find it and destroy it. This will summon the boss Plantera. After you beat her, the Cyborg will want to live in a house., After you beat it, Santa Claus is available to spawn (note: You only have from December 15 to December 31 to get Santa to spawn. After that, he no longer spawns. Once you get him, he stays all year round, though).

 Determinate tomatoes are often called "bush" tomatoes, and they should not be pruned. Indeterminate tomatoes have a vine-like structure that can be pruned.
 Before you prune, you should ensure that you are giving your tomato plants the right support. Determinate tomatoes do well in cages, whereas indeterminate, or pruning-friendly, varieties do better with long stakes.
 Tie the vine to the stake with twine or ribbon. Continue to tie the vine to the stake as it grows.
 This will prevent blight and insects, especially during the wet season. Try to keep the first 12 inches (0.3m) clear of the ground.
 Remove the side shoots regularly, about every 2 to 3 days.


Although pruning young tomato plants may seem strange, it will actually help the plant to grow and produce more. You can begin pruning after about 4 weeks.
 Then, they can be pruned to 4 fruits on later clusters.

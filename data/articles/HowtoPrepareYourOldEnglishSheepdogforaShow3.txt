, If you are going to breed the Old English Sheepdog, you are going to need your dogs to be well groomed and presentable. You will usually be able to find courses from your local kennel club, or from the breeder you are choosing to get your dog from.
 Make sure your house is safe for your puppy. Make sure electric cords are out of the "chewing zone", all plastic bits and paper are out of "choking zone", and that you have baby gates put up in places that are off limits to pooches.
 There are many pages on wikiHow that will tell you what supplies that you need for your new puppy. Buy all your necessities for your new puppy that you will be bringing home.
 Set up a vet appointment BEFORE you get your puppy so that you do not have to wait over a month for Fido to get its last set of puppy booster shots. The date should be the day after you get your poochie. Your breeder (if local) will probably give you a preferred vet, but do your research and find the best veterinarian in your area.

 Often, just ignoring the troll will make him/her know that no one cares about his trying to pester, and will change the chat or lobby to annoy them.;
, If the chat has a mute/ignore option, use it. It can be quite helpful because it gets rid of the messages the troll sends.
 Trolls may often be truly strange, and will change the subject from e.g. "Your dog is a noob." to "I think that plastic bag of yours was pathetic.". Trolls can't usually be predicted, but sometimes they can.
 This includes moderators, administrators etc. people that hold powers to ban/silence the trolls.

 One of the easiest things you can do to make sleeping easier if you have carpal tunnel syndrome is to wear a wrist brace to bed. This will prevent you from bending and flexing your wrist while you sleep.You may want to wear a brace during the day as well, depending on what kinds of activities typically cause you pain.
You can buy a brace at any drug store, or your doctor may suggest that you have a custom one made for you.;
, Although it hasn't been definitively proven, sleeping on your side may be associated with a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome. This is likely due to the fact that the wrist is more likely to be compressed in this position. If you sleep on your side, try sleeping on your back to avoid further compressing your wrist as you sleep., It's important to think about where you normally place your arms while you sleep and whether or not this may be worsening your symptoms. Try to avoid sleeping with either arm underneath you or your pillow, as this may worsen your carpal tunnel syndrome.Propping your arms up on pillows while you sleep may help relieve tension and reduce pain. If you are sleeping on your side, make sure the side affected by carpal tunnel is on top. Place a pillow in front of you and place the affected hand on the pillow. You may need to experiment with the height of the pillow to find the most comfortable position for you.
 Bending your elbow may increase the compression on your nerve, which can make your symptoms worse. As much as possible, try to keep your elbow straight throughout the night.You may want to try wrapping a towel around your elbow so that it is difficult to bend. This may help you train yourself to keep your arm straight at night.

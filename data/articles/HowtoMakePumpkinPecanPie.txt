, Preheat the baking sheet in the oven, so that you can place the pie on the cookie sheet to bake.
 In a large bowl, mix one egg, pumpkin, 1/3 cup sugar, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt.
 Use a rubber spatula to spread on the pie crust.
 In another bowl, beat the remaining eggs slightly.
 Stir in the corn syrup, 2/3 cup sugar, butter, and vanilla. Stir it until well blended.
 Add the pecans and carefully spoon on top of the pumpkin mixture.
 Bake 50 to 60 minutes or until filling is set around edge.
 Depending on the ambient temperature, this could be up to 5 hours. Enjoy!

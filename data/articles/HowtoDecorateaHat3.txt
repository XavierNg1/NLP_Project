 For an eye-catching design, you might want to add some decorations to your hat that will catch the light.


Use dots of hot glue to add sequins, rhinestones, or shiny buttons all over your hat.
If you want to use glitter, first spread a thin layer of glue on your hat where you want the glitter to go. Fabric glue works well for this. You could make a design like a star.
Shake the glitter over your glue design, and then, after waiting about a minute, gently shake off any excess. Make sure you have a piece of newspaper under your hat to catch any excess glitter., For an over-the-top hat, you want to add as much tasteful volume as you can.


Feathers can be glued against the crown of a hat. Try using different colors and sizes in an arrangement for more visual interest.
A cluster of homemade rosettes can make a great statement, whether they are an array of colors or monochromatic.
Tulle fabric can be cut and shaped into a huge bow to add to almost any design. If you want a tulle bow, first form the bow and glue it together, and then glue it to your hat., This will help you envision your finished product, and make a statement.


Your theme could be as simple as shades of blue, or more complex.
For example, you could have a garden theme, and glue branches of fake flowers and little fake bird onto your hat.
Or, you might have a more modern them, and only use black and white decorations, like clear rhinestones and a spray of black feathers on top of a black hat.

 Your router is the device needed to connect your computer(s) to the internet. Within a home, it's usually called a Wifi-router which means that it allows your computer to be wireless, and hence more portable and accessible. Though different routers might require different addresses in order to be opened, most routers can be accessed with the same address. As with the previous method, this is also a bit technical.


Enter 192.168.1.1 into your browser. If this address doesn't work for your router, try two of the following ones: 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.2.1.

If you need more help figuring out your router, check out one or both of these sites: www.routerpasswords.com and www.cirt.net.


Once prompted, enter your username and password.
 It might be named security panel or it might be something different. Either way, navigate to the tab that displays blocking controls. They can normally be reached under "Content Filtering" or "Access Restrictions".
 Now that you have found the correct location, you can begin entering web addresses you wish to block or remove.


Press save and apply when you are finished.

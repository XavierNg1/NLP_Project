 Take a saucepan and fill it at least half way full with water. You will need a large amount of water in order to be sure that the corn is fully submerged. Place the pan on high heat until boiling, then reduce the heat until the water is simmering.


Be sure to season your water with a little salt, especially if this is the only method you will be using to cook the corn.;
, Once the water is simmering, place the corn in the saucepan. Stir with a wooden spoon to make sure the corn does not stick together and will cook evenly.Remove a kernel or two from the water with the spoon after 2 to 4 minutes to check that the corn is tender.
 Take a sieve and place or hold it over your sink. Pour all of the contents of your saucepan through the sieve, letting the boiling water drain and the cooked corn remain in the sieve. Once strained, season as you desire.

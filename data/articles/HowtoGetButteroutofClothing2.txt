 This method will work best if you get to the stain while it’s still wet, before it’s had a chance to really set into the fabric.
 Choose a location out of the way, where it won’t get jostled or knocked to the ground. You don’t want to make a bigger mess than you already have by getting powder all over the place!

Pat the powder gently down into the stain, but don’t rub it into the fabric.
 The longer you let it sit on the stain, the better your chances of the butter being completely removed. At minimum, let it sit for half an hour before moving on to the next step.
 Use the toothbrush to loosen the talcum powder or cornstarch from the surface of the stain. Brush it away with your fingers and assess how much stain has been left behind.


If the stain has not been completely removed, repeat the process until it has.

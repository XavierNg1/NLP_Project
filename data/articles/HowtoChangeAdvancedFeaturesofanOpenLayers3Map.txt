 Openlayers provides a CSS file that sets the appearance of controls really nicely, so we should import that first.

, Once the CSS file is imported, you'll see that the map already has 2 controls; zoom in and out buttons, and an ‘i’ button for showing map attributions. We'll also add 2 controls of our own, which don't require any configuring (their default settings are fine).




var fullscreen_control = new ol.control.FullScreen();
map.addControl(fullscreen_control);
 
var zoom_slider_control = new ol.control.ZoomSlider();
map.addControl(zoom_slider_control);




, Interactions let us 'interact' with an OpenLayers map in way such as panning and zooming using a mouse. They are invisible, and an OpenLayers map will already have several interactions when you create it! One interaction that is sometimes a bother 'zooms the map when you use your mouse wheel'. To remove it, iterate through the interactions and remove any that have the same type as ‘MouseWheelZoom’.




var interactions = map.getInteractions();
 
function remove_interaction(interaction, index, array) {
  var is_mouseWheelZoom = interaction instanceof ol.interaction.MouseWheelZoom;
 
  if (is_mouseWheelZoom) {
    map.removeInteraction(interaction);
  }
}
 
interactions.forEach(remove_interaction);




, Overlays are elements that can be positioned in a specific location on the map. They can be used to add information to a map feature or a location, like adding a popup that displays the name of a country. Overlays are powerful because OpenLayers can use any most HTML elements as overlays. Also note that if you'd like to add interactivity - such as the popup only appearing when you click something - that must be added separately.




<div id="popup" class="popup">Chad</div>








var popup = new ol.Overlay({
  element: document.getElementById('popup')
});
popup.setPosition(point_feature.getGeometry().getCoordinates());
popup.setPositioning('bottom-center');
popup.setOffset();
map.addOverlay(popup);

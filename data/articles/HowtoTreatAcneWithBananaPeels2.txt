 If you have wrinkles you'd like to treat or have very dry cracked heels, use a banana. Apply a mashed banana directly to the wrinkles or heels of your feet and let the puree sit. The bananas will moisturize your skin and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.


Specifically, the vitamin E in bananas can make your skin appear less wrinkled., Mash one ripe banana in a bowl until it's almost liquid. Stir in 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of sugar or 2–3 tablespoons (29.6–44.4 ml) of oats. These will make it easier to apply to your skin and will slough off any dead skin cells. Rinse the scrub off with warm water and follow up with a moisturizer.


Be gentle with exfoliating your skin. Never scrub your skin with rough movements, since this can damage your skin. Instead, carefully use your fingertips and apply the scrub in a circular motion.
 For a quick moisturizing facial mask, take a ripe banana and mash it with a fork until it's somewhat liquidy. Smear this on your face and let it sit for 15 to 20 minutes. If you want to add other benefits to the mask, try mixing in one of these ingredients:Turmeric powder: has antibacterial properties that can fight infection
Baking powder: can open pores and remove excess oil
Lemon juice: can lighten and tone the skin
Honey: may kill acne-causing bacteria

, Don't forget that banana is also good for treating hair problems. Mash a banana or two and mix in a tablespoon of honey or a few drops of almond oil. Apply this to your wet hair and let it sit for about 15 minutes. Then, rinse off it with water.


The banana and honey or oil can moisturize dry and damaged hair.

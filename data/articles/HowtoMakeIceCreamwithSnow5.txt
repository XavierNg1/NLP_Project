 Using a large mixing bowl, mix together the following 5 ingredients. You may also substitute any flavor of cake mix or vodka. You may also completely omit the vodka and add additional milk.½ cup (125 ml) sweetened condensed milk
¼ cup (60 ml) yellow cake mix
3 Tbsp (45 ml) cake flavored vodka
2 Tbsp (30 ml) milk
1 tsp (5 ml) vanilla

, Gather about 8 cups (half a gallon) of fresh snow and mix it in immediately with the cake batter mixture. Time is crucial as you do not want the snow to melt. Mix until you have your desired consistency of ice cream.
 Whether you enjoy peanuts or cherries, add whatever you desire., Cover the ice cream once mixed and place it in outside or your freezer as it may be fairly soft. The longer you freeze, the harder consistency.

 Find a spot that you can set out enough chairs for your students. If you're playing at home, your bedroom might be too small. Instead, ask your parents if you can move around some furniture to set up your main classroom.


Use folding chairs, if you have them, and set them up in rows. For desks, you can use little stools. You can also just use chairs.
Pick the front of the classroom and put a big piece of paper on the wall, like the a chalk board. Use markers to write on the paper instead of chalk.;
, If you're playing at home, try to plan out your whole school. Make each room in the house a different room in the school. Good school rooms to have for your play include:


Bathroom
Principal's office
Detention room
Playground
Lunchroom or cafeteria

, To really play school, you'll need at least a couple of things. Ask your "students" to bring their own supplies, or try to find enough around your house. try to find:


Pencils, pens, or crayons
Notebooks or paper
Books
Binders
Erasers

, Do you want to teach the grade you're in? Your favorite grade you already went through? Or maybe you want to jump all the way up and teach a high school class? Could be fun. Pick the grade the sound the most fun and then change your lesson so it matches.


Also, pick a subject! Do you want to teach math? Science? English? Pick a specific subject that will be fun and plan a lesson.

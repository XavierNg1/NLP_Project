 Waking up on time is the basis for your entire schedule, so it is important to get up at the same time to start your day. Consider how much time you need in the morning to get ready for school and set your alarm accordingly. You may want to add some surplus time in case something comes up that was not planned for.;
, Breakfast is the most important meal of the day because it gives you the energy to make it to lunch, or in some cases, the end of school. It is important you get the servings you need of calories, carbohydrates, and proteins.
 This includes getting dressed and practicing good hygiene. Make sure you are clean, well fed, and ready to learn in a school environment.
 Include anything you'll need throughout the day to avoid any problems in your routine. Consider making an easily-accessible checklist to be sure you won't forget anything.
 Besides having a small snack, the first thing you will want to do when you get home is to do your homework. Getting this done will reduce most stress relating to school, and will set your brain in a productive state.
 To get the most of your day, you will want to make sure that you are doing the things you need to be doing at the time they need to be done. You may want to use an app to organize your tasks or write them down on paper.
 If you are working hard, then it is important to allow your brain to take breaks, so it can remain focused on the project at hand. If you are feeling tired or bored, try doing push ups or pull ups as an alternative to something counter-productive, such as watching TV.
 One thing that may be keeping you back from having a good routine is a distraction. This is why it is important to remove or avoid anything that may draw your attention away from what you are currently doing.

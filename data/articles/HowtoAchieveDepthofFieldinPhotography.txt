It is best to have a wide angle lens. This will provide more depth and photographic options for you. Telephoto or zoom lenses can be used, but the DOF may not be as dramatic.

When deciding on your subject--the part of your picture that needs to be in crystal clear focus--make sure you look at the areas in front of and beyond the subject. These are the areas that will be out of focus in your picture. Bokeh is a term used to refer to the blur of the picture.






The background should be a complimentary or contrasting color to your subject for optimal visual impact. A green field behind a red barn is an example of good contrast. The green in the field is going to blur out and give you a green backdrop for your subject.



You can use manual or auto-focus.



The aperture on a lens refers to the "eye" of the camera. The lens aperture is similar to the pupil of an eye. If it is dark outside, your pupil will dilate. The same holds true for your lens aperture. This is also referred to as the f-stop setting. The higher the f-stop number, the smaller the aperture. The smaller the f-stop number, the larger the aperture.






Try stopping down to a larger aperture, which means a smaller f-number. You can try starting with f/2.8. The lower your f-stop number, the shorter your DOF is going to be. The higher the f-number, such as f/22, the more of the picture will be in focus.



Creating bokeh is a matter of personal taste. Decide what you like best. Note the setting for future reference.



Being a little closer to your subject or further away can increase the drama of your picture.
 This can also add or reduce your depth of field. Using a zoom lens will increase Bokeh, and using a wide angle lens will reduce it.

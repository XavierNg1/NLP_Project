 Some surfaces take damage more easily than others. Be respectful of where and how you interact with your environment, and take responsibility if you accidentally damage something. Check out the surface you are on or will be going on before trying anything remotely dangerous on it. Importantly, that surface may also be slippery, fragile or unstable so survey the area first. If you slip or something moves/breaks under you it could cause a painful fall.
 You won't need much. All you need is a good pair of running shoes and an outfit you're comfortable moving and exercising in.
 Try to trace a path from A to B. Go through the path and do everything that feels natural in that situation. Parkour is not a set of vaults, movements or "stunts." It is a way of moving, and moving is always changing, and no set motions could be ready to meet the quota. A good way to find ways to get there is trying different ways and consider what is efficient and fast.
 This is what separates traceurs from your average trickster or acrobat. Flow is the flawless transition from one obstacle to the next, to the point where there might as well not be any obstacles at all. Flow can be practiced simply by adding good form and correct technique, thus creating fluidity to all of your movements. This includes soft landings (as opposed to stomping down or falling).
 Make sure to keep yourself in peak physical condition. Traceurs and traceuses use most of their body in order to navigate any obstacle. This level of involvement requires total body fitness.
 Find a spot that you can come to every day to train. Good areas include diverse obstacles (walls, rails, etc). Your overall goal is to find creative ways to make it through the "sea" of obstacles using your body in any way necessary.

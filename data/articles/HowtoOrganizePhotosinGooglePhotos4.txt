 You can remove a photo from an album (without deleting it) using the mobile app or at http://photos.google.com.
 It’s at the bottom of the mobile app, and on the left side of the website. The icon looks like a square with a bookmark at its upper-right edge. Once clicked or tapped, a list of your albums will appear.
 The contents of the album will appear.
 It’s at the top right corner of both the website and the mobile app.
 Also, you’ll see a small X at the top left corner of each photo.
 The photo will disappear from the album. You’ll still be able to find it in the main photos list when you first access Google Photos.

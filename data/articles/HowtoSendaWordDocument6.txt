 If you have a Word document on your computer that you want to send to someone else, you can do so using the web version of Facebook.For this method to work, both you and the person to whom you’d like to send the document need to have Facebook accounts.
The Facebook Messenger app does not support attaching documents saved to your phone, other than photos or videos

, You will be attaching the document to a chat message.


Click the mail icon at the top right area of Facebook and select “New Message.”
Start typing the person’s name into the “To:” field and then click their name when it appears in the search results.
 Now you’ll be able to navigate to the Word document on your computer.
 If you’re using a Mac, the button will say “Choose File.”

, The recipient will be able to download the document by double-clicking the icon that appeared in the chat window.

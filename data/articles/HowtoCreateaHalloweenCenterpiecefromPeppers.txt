 If you want to light up your peppers, you will need battery-operated flicker lights.;
, This is not much different than carving pumpkins. First, cut the cap to access the inside of the pepper. To do this, hold the knife at a 45 degree angle and cut in a circle around the stem. Stay about 2" away from the stem. Cutting at an angle will help keep the top from falling into the pepper when you put it back on.
 Do not cut too much off of the cap or it will not fit back on the pepper. Set the top aside.
 Do not push too hard or you could push through the side of the pepper.
 Pat dry.
 If you need inspiration for pumpkin faces, an internet search will give you limitless options.

 How you turn on the feature depends on the version of Word you're using. Word 2003 and earlier versions use the older menu and toolbar interface, while Word 2007 and 2010 use the newer menu ribbon interface.


In Word 2003, select "Markup" from the "View" menu.
In Word 2007 and 2010, click the "Show Markup" drop-down in the Tracking group of the Review menu ribbon and make sure the Comments option is checked.
Selecting Markup from the View menu again in Word 2003 or unchecking the Comments option in Word 2007 or 2010 will turn off the markup feature, hiding the comments.;
, Comment balloons display only when your document is in either the Print Layout view, the Web Layout view, or the Full Screen Reading view in Word 2007 and 2010. To change the display, do the following:


In Word 2003, click Print Layout or Web Layout on the View menu.
In Word 2007 and 2010, select Print Layout or Web Layout from the Document Views group on the View menu ribbon.
If you do not have the correct display view, your comments will not appear, but portions of the text that were highlighted to be commented upon will retain their highlighting and be followed by the comment number.

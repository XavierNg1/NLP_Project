 To chemically dechlorinate your swimming pool, you can use dechlorination tablets or liquid, such as sodium thiosulphate. The most common chemical for dechlorination is sulfur dioxide, although carbon absorption, sodium metabisulfite, and hydrogen peroxide are also used for this purpose. You should make sure the product you purchase from your swimming pool retailer states that it meets Environmental Protection Agency standards., You can use ascorbic acid or sodium ascorbate, which are two forms of vitamin C, to dechlorinate water. Vitamin C does not remove oxygen from the water and is not toxic to aquatic life. Whereas sulphur-based products remove oxygen from water and are toxic to fish, vitamin C-based dechlorinators, such as Vita-D-Chlor, are aligned with the EPA’s Clean Water Act. They are safe to handle and easy to dissolve.Vitamin C-based dechlorinators are more expensive than sulphur-based products.
 If you are looking for the most thorough method of dechlorination, carbon absorption is the way to go. However, it is more expensive than some of the other methods, such as sulphur-based dechlorination tablets. You’ll have to ask a swimming pool specialist about the carbon filters that are available for your pool.You could ask the pool professional, “Is there a carbon-based filter that would work well for my pool?”

, You can use an appropriate amount of sodium thiosulphate to dechlorinate your pool. Pour some warm water in a bucket. Add the required amount of sodium thiosulphate to the bucket. Pour the contents of the bucket into the pool.If your pool contains 5000 gallons of water and the total chlorine is currently 50 ppm, you’ll need to add 1.56 pounds (.7 kilograms) of sodium thiosulfate.
Use an online dechlorination calculator to determine how much sodium thiosulphate to use.

 Everyone has different likes and dislikes during sex. If you do get to the topic of having sex on the first date, discuss what would be enjoyable for both of you. Be sure to discuss any unconventional activities that you would like to do. If they do come as a surprise to your date, it will be nice to have had a fair warning.
 Part of having safe sex is feeling comfortable with the person you are being intimate with. If there is anything that you are not comfortable doing, you should state that firmly to your partner. You might say, for example, “I want to have sex with you, but I do not want to give you oral sex. I just don’t feel comfortable doing that right now.”
Everyone differs on how, when, and where, they prefer sexual contact. It is important to be clear about any personal boundaries you have. Try saying, “Just so you know, I hate it when people touch my legs, so don’t go there.”

, Some people enjoy including things other than their date during sex. The use of sex toys can be discussed ahead of time so that both of you are on the same page. Similarly, including other people in the mix should be discussed and approved by everyone involved.

Mini peanut butter cups, M&Ms, sprinkles, cranberries, and coconut all work just as well (if not better!).
 They will spread when baking, so leave some room between each cookie.









If it appeals to you, roll the dough in sprinkles before baking. Don't worry! The sprinkles retain their color and shape. You don't need frosting to add in sprinkles, thankfully.
 If your oven cooks unevenly, flip them halfway through.
 Place onto a wire rack to cool completely. Top with frosting if it meshes well with the cake mix you used.
 Bring them to any occasion and tell everyone you made them yourself!

, Fold it in half (the short way).
, Use the black paint to put three big black dots in the center of the page. Don't paint near the edges.
 Use your hand to slide spread the paint done the crease. In this case, you will be making a body for the butterfly.
 Now use the paintbrush to make the wings. To make the wings, draw a number 3 shape from about 2 cm/1 inch from the top of the butterfly to the same point at the bottom of the butterfly.
 You will have a fully completed outlined butterfly.
 Cover up any white spots or awkward angles.
 The colors are up to you. One suggestion is to use black, orange and pink as a color scheme. Or use neon colors, or the colors of spring. Only paint the spots on one side.
 Push lightly on the dots you've just painted and open the paper back up. Let the paint dry.
, Roll up the ends to look like real antennae.
 Punch a hole through the top of the butterfly's body and thread ribbon or string through it. Hang the end design up for display.
 If you did, you done goofed, and the consequences will NEVER be the same.

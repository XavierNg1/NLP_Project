 Almost any fabric can work, but consider the purpose of the pillow you want. If you are going to be using it rest on at night, pick a fabric that feels good against your face. If your pillow will be decorative, pick a fabric that matches your other furniture.;
, A simple pillow is basically two pieces of fabric stitched together and filled with a soft stuffing. Your two pieces should be slightly bigger than you want your pillow to be long and wide.









Add a one and a half-inch seam allowance on all sides. A seam allowance is the amount of fabric that extends beyond the stitching.
If your fabric is prone to fray, hem the edges of your fabric with a straight or zig zag stitch.
 Make sure you don't run out of thread in the middle.
 After stitching them together you are going to be turning the pillow inside-out, so make sure you place together the sides that you want facing out in the end.
 You can do this either by hand or with a sewing machine. The slip stitch is the best choice. Again, leave a half-inch seam allowance.
 You should now see the sides of the fabric that you want facing out, formed into a pocket that you will fill with stuffing.
 If your pillow has wrinkles when you stuff it, getting them out will be nearly impossible.
 Tuck a half-inch of fabric at the open edge inside the pillow and iron it flat. You are now ready to stuff and finish your pillow.
 Take your stuffing and push it into the open side of your pillow. Try to keep the stuffing evenly distributed as you go. Don't stop until your pillow is full and has no obvious areas of slack in its body. Store-bought cotton filler works best, but anything from down feathers to scrap fabric can work.
 A whip stitch involves passing your needle from one side to the other, while overcasting the thread along the outer part of the seam.









You can also use the blind stitch here to create a neater look.

 Place a single piece of Scotch tape over the lower half of each fingernail, leaving the chipped tips exposed. The tape will protect the lower half of your nails from the new color. Choose another shade of polish for the tips. Apply the new shade to the exposed nail tips, which will create a color-block effect.When choosing the new polish, you can stay within the same color family or choose a contrasting hue for a more unique look.
Do not remove the tape until the new polish has dried completely.
 Choose three or four different nail polish colors, mixing and matching the hues in whatever way you see fit. Apply the polishes one at a time by swiping, drizzling, swirling and dabbing them on. Don’t worry about being too neat and tidy with this. The finished effect will resemble the abstract paintings made by Jackson Pollock, which featured splatters of many different colors of paint.If the abstract look isn’t for you, use a new polish color to create polka dots. A pointed cotton swab can help you create consistent-looking polka dots.
 Choose a nail polish in a contrasting hue and carefully paint one thin coat to the very edges of your nails. Do this to all of your nails, not just the chipped ones. Allow the tips to dry and apply a high-gloss topcoat over all of your nails.If you have chips on the sides of your nails rather than the tips, try a side-French manicure instead.


To create a side-French look: Apply an opaque nude nail polish down one side of each of your nails. Use a swift swiping motion for best results., Use superglue or nail glue to affix nail art, such as rhinestones or crystals, to your fingernails. These can completely obscure the chipped areas and other imperfections until you have time for another manicure. Check out nail stickers, too. If you apply nail stickers, don’t forget to top it all off with a quick-drying topcoat polish.

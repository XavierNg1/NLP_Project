 If they still don't understand spankings and time-out is is still in the picture. Even if they are a little old.;
, Lay down the law so when you get to the next step they know that something is going to change.
 If they do not follow your rules. Do not allow them to go anywhere(for the older kids) or let them watch TV, no candy, no eating(for one specific thing you have to do). If they still don't spanking and time outs!

, Well, the only other way is to keep them in there room. Make sure that they don't get what they want. Push them over the top and never let them anything(food is not one of the things you can't give them)!!

, After they learn you have to make sure that they will keep doing this. Some kids are different. One kind of kid is they learn easily and start doing what you say and then they start doing what they did before. Another type of kid is they take a long time to learn and in a week or so they do what they were doing before. If you have a kid that comes home with good grades they might just keep with what you say!

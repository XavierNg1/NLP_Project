 You will need fighting equipment, including a bow, a LOT of arrows (at least 128) and a diamond sword. Armour is advised, but not required. Oh, and try to get a bow with the enchantment Infinity I (this will give you infinite arrows).;
, To find it, follow this guide. When you have found the portal, make a bed so if you die you'll respawn there.
 It should load a bit, and then you should appear on a floating egg-shaped island of end stone (A hearty tip: gather this material up. It's blast resistant.) in an area known as the Void

, This means that you shouldn't hit them or look at them,.or [ If for some reason an Enderman does try to hit/kill you, survive like this

, Before you attack him, destroy the beacons found on the obsidian towers with your bow; they do heal him. It usually attacks you when you are not looking at it, so if you want a chance of hitting it with your diamond sword, look away from it and wait about 6 seconds, then quickly turn towards it: it should be charging towards you.
 Keep hitting him with your bow and sword until he dies. When you do kill him, a portal should appear; you have won Minecraft!

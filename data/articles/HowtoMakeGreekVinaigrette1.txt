 Add ¼ cup (44 ml) of extra virgin olive oil, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of red wine vinegar, the juice from 1 lemon, 2 garlic cloves that have been smashed and peeled, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of dried oregano leaves, 3 pinches of salt, and 10 to 15 grinds of fresh black pepper to a jar or other container with a lid. Put the lid on the container, and shake vigorously to mix the dressing.If you don’t have garlic cloves, you can substitute ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of garlic powder.;
, After the dressing is well mixed, remove the lid from the jar. Give the vinaigrette a taste, and add more salt and pepper if you think it’s necessary.If you feel like your dressing doesn’t have a strong enough garlic taste, don’t worry. The garlic flavor becomes stronger the longer that it sits. However, if you plan to use the dressing right after mixing it, you may want to mince or press the cloves instead of smashing them.
 When you’re happy with the seasoning of the vinaigrette, put the lid back on the jar. Place it in the refrigerator, and use it within a week.The ingredients tend to separate as the dressing sits, so be sure to stir or shake it before using it.

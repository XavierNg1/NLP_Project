 Start by logging into your Facebook account. On your home screen, look for a small icon in the top right corner that looks like a padlock next to a few lines. Click this button., This will cause a new menu box to open. Here, you'll see a brief explanation of how blocking people on Facebook works.
 Click "Block" to continue. This won't block the person yet â€” you still need to confirm your choice.


Keep in mind that some people don't use their real name for their Facebook account. If this is true for the person who's been bothering you, you may need to search for this person's "joke" name or use their email address.
 Once you hit the first "Block" button, a new window will pop up with a list of results that match your search. Find the person you want, then click "block" next to his or her name.


This will cause one final window to pop up. This window will explain, in detail, exactly what blocking means for your Facebook relationship with this person. Click the "Block" button here to finalize your choice. The person won't be blocked until you finish this step.

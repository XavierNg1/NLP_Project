 Use a sharp knife or snips to get a clean cutting.Cut short, two or three inch branches from near the crown of the patchouli plant. Remove the leaves from the bottom of each cutting.Choose branches that have at least one node, which is where you have a stem with little buds where flowers or leaves are growing.If you have a friend with a pot of patchouli, you can use cuttings from their plant to grow patchouli.
It is best to gather cuttings in the late summer or early fall., To make sure you get at least one cutting that takes root, you should cut three or four branches from each of your patchouli plants. This will give you some insurance in case some of them fail to grow., You should use sterilized glass jars, such as mason jars. Fill the jar with water up to the lowest set of leaves on the cutting. The water should be room temperature. When the roots of the cutting grow to between one quarter and half an inch in length, you can plant them in a pot.Every three days, replace the water in the jar.
Patchouli roots in water very easily., Use a small stick to make little planting holes in the pot. Space the holes a few inches apart, wherever you want to propagate a patchouli plant., Each cutting should have one node that is above the soil. Water the cuttings. Put a cover over the pot to retain humidity. Eventually, at least a couple of the patchouli plants should take root. You will have a new patchouli plant by springtime!If you live in a cooler climate where freezing occurs, you should bring the pots inside during the winter.

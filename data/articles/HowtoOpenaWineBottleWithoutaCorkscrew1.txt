 It should be narrower than the cork and something that will not stab, shatter, burst, chip, or break the cork or bottle. A cheap white ballpoint pen or basic marker (including a highlighter or dry erase marker), in each case with the cap on, will work well. You could also use a long rod, a cylindrical container of chapstick, or a slim knife sharpener. Carabiners work well, too., You can put in your lap to keep it in place. You could simply rest it on a table as well.You can also place the object against a wall or other vertical service and press horizontally. Push on the bottle's wide base to force the cork in easily. Hold the neck area and the other end of your object to prevent slipping. Make sure the surface is strong enough so that it will not dimple, or protected, like a wall padded with some junk mail.
 The cork is usually already recessed slightly into the bottle's neck. If the cork is flush with the end of the bottle, push your object against the cork to force it in a little. This will allow your object to stay in place without slipping off the side of the bottle.
 Point the bottle away from people, just in case wine sprays out. While gripping the bottle with one hand and your object with the other hand, push firmly on the cork until it falls into the bottle. Be ready for the wine to splash a bit when the cork hits it.








This method works well but you will likely end up with small pieces of cork in your wine.
The surrounding area (and the opener's clothes!) should be stain resistant as a little wine may spill; don't try this with red wine and a nice outfit or over a carpet. Have some napkins handy; you may wish to wrap one around the neck as you push.

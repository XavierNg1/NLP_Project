 If you do not want to change your word processor and you cannot toggle HTML formatting, then you can still format normally and convert it to an HTML format.
 This will convert the formatting to HTML and allow you to copy that formatting when you open it.


Go to File > Save As… and select Web Page (.htm or .html) from the “Save As Type” menu. This path may vary depending on the word processor you are using.
 The web browser will open a web page with the formatted text. If the file does not open with the browser by default there are two other options:


Drag and drop the .html file onto your browser icon.
Right-click the .html file and select “Open With…” and select your web browser from the list.
 Since the webpage will be HTML formatted, there should be no problem pasting it into your email client with the formatting intact.

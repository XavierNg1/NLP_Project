 Grease the pan. Then line both the base and sides with the parchment or baking paper.
 Add the cream and sugar to the Baileys.
 Heat to bring to the boil, stirring continuously. Continue to stir until the sugar dissolves.


Adjust the heat if needed, to prevent the mixture from boiling over but to allow it to bubble.
 this is when you drop a little of the mixture into a little cold water and the sugary mass forms a soft ball.
 Stir through until melted in evenly.
 Smooth the top with the back of a spoon or a spatula.
 After it has set, cut into individual squares or fingers. The fudge can be wrapped in wax paper or clear cellophane, or served immediately.


If you don't wish to wrap individual squares or fingers, keep in an airtight container lined with wax paper. Use wax paper if you need to layer it.

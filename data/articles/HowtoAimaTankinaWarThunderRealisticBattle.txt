With practice, you should be able to identify different ranges and know where to aim.
If identifying ranges is too hard for you, bind a key in the controls menu to "rangefinder". The rangefinder will tell you the estimated range that a tank is at.



In test drive, you will be able to experiment with your tank gun at different ranges without worrying about being killed.
Remember to adjust your test drive settings to realistic battles.
 The only way you can get better at tank realistic battles is to play!


Don't worry about not hitting your target the first few times; it takes practice.

 The tenant improvement allowance is the amount of money the landlord agrees to contribute towards leasehold improvements. The way the allowance is recorded in financial statements depends on the nature of the agreement between the landlord and the tenant. The landlord may have agreed to reimburse the tenant for the expenses. Alternatively, the tenant might receive free or discounted rent for a number of months., Both the tenant and the landlord are required to recognize the rent on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. This means that the total amount of rent over the entire term of the lease should be divided by the number of months in the lease so that the same amount of rent is recorded each month, even in rent-free or reduced rent months.For example, suppose the lease for the hair salon stated that the monthly rent would be $2,000 for a term of 60 months and that the landlord agreed to contribute $10,000 to the leasehold improvements in the form of free rent for five months.
In this example, the hair salon is paying $2,000 per month for 55 months, or $110,000 total ($2,000 x 55 = $110,000).
The term of the lease is 60 months, so the monthly rent that must be recorded as an expense for the tenant and as revenue for the landlord must be $1,833.33 ($110,000 / 60 = $1,833.33).
 If the landlord reimburses the tenant for leasehold improvements, this is considered a lease incentive. Both the tenant and the landlord must record the entire amount of the incentive on their balance sheets. Then the incentive is recorded as deferred rent over the life of the lease.The landlord records the gross value of the incentive as an asset on the balance sheet. Then the asset is expensed over the term of the lease as a reduction of rental income.
The tenant records the gross value of the incentive as a liability on the balance sheet. Then the liability is recorded as a reduction of rental expense over the term of the lease.
Suppose in the above example, the landlord gave the tenant $10,000 to use for leasehold improvements. The landlord would record $10,000 as an asset on the balance sheet. If the lease were for 60 months, then the monthly reduction to rental income to be recorded on the income statement would be $166.67 ($10,000 / 60 = $166.67).
In the same example, the tenant would record a $10,000 liability under fixed assets on their own balance sheet. This would be offset by a $166.67 reduction in rental expense each month over the term of the lease.

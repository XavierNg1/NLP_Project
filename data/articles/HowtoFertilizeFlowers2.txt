 The first step will be deciding if you will use a natural fertilizer or a synthetic one. There are some benefits to each.Natural fertilizers are composed of organic material. Examples include compost (homemade or store-bought), manure, cottonseed meal, blood meal, bone meal, fish emulsion, and liquid seaweed.
Synthetic fertilizers come in a variety of forms, such as granules, water-soluble powders, and liquid concentrates.
 Purchasing natural fertilizer (as opposed to generating your own compost) can be cost prohibitive. A similar quantity of synthetic fertilizer will definitely cost less. However, natural fertilizers will release more nutrients slowly over time, nourishing your plants for longer and improving the quality of your soil over time. , Within a day of applying a synthetic fertilizer (particularly a water-soluble variety) you will see dramatic results. This may be the right choice for you if your plants need an immediate pick-me-up.
 Natural fertilizers work slowly because they are improving the quality of your soil from the inside out. Rather than merely providing nutrients directly to the plant, they also provide nutrients that will remain in the soil. Natural fertilizers can improve the quality of your soil, meaning that you will ultimately need fertilizers less frequently., Natural fertilizers are much better for your soil over time, but they are much slower to release. One option is to use a natural fertilizer as your primary fertilizer, but to also give your plants the occasional boost with a water-soluble synthetic fertilizer.

 At most parties, partygoers wear their street clothes. However, in college, especially around Rush Week or certain holidays, some parties require a bit of conformity. If it’s early in the semester, the fraternities and sororities might throw toga parties. If it’s closer to Halloween, you could be going to a costume party. You might have to wear red for a Valentine’s Day party. While each outfit will have some degree of individuality, standing out too much could trigger social awkwardness.
 What you wear to a party can determine whether you’re fidgeting all night or feeling comfortable and relaxed. Wear an outfit that reflects you. If you feel confident in your outfit, confidence in your social skills is right around the corner.


Even if there’s a dress code, you don’t have to sacrifice confidence. If you’re nervous about wearing a toga, ask the host of there’s some wiggle room in the dress code. Maybe you could wear a white tank top and white trousers under your costume. If black isn’t your color, forget about the Goth costume for Halloween and opt for something a bit lighter.
 Thick fabrics can cause you to sweat, increasing your internal stress levels. In the winter, wear a jacket over your party outfit. If it gets too hot, stash your jacket in the coat room, or ask the host where you can hang it.
 Lighter colors do not attract heat as well as dark colors do. Looser clothes allow more air to pass between the fabric and the skin, making the wearer feel cooler and less likely to sweat.If you do sweat, a loose top will not stick to your skin and pick up embarrassing sweat stains.

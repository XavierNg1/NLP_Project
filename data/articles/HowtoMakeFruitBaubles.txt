 Suitable fruit includes apples, pears, oranges, mandarins, lemons, etc. Choose good quality specimens, as these will be on display.


Seasonal fruit is good, as it's affordable and likely to be in the best condition. It also helps to celebrate the season.;
, You could use cord, raffia, thin ribbon, string, etc. The method for wrapping is as follows:


Wind the cord around the fruit in the same manner as for tying string around a parcel.
Tie a strong knot to secure in place at the top. Leave plenty of cord intact for hanging the fruit from at the top and for adding decoration at the bottom.
 This is what the fruit bauble will hang from.
 Beads, dried citrus slices, herbs, etc., can be threaded on. Tie a firm knot to keep the decorative pieces in place. Trim off excess and neaten.


If using raffia, fray the end after cutting for the dangling base piece. This adds a nice touch.
If using ribbon, cut the end piece in a V shape, or diagonally, to prevent further fraying.
 It's heavier than your standard bauble, so use either a sturdy branch, curtain rod, thick dowel, or other such strong item for hanging from.

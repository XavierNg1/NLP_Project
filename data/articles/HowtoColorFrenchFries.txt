 If needed, wash and pat dry.;
, Cut the sticks approximately 1/2 inch/1 cm thick. This thickness helps the color to distribute well and will also speed up the cooking time.
 Add the food coloring and mix to combine thoroughly.


If you're doing more than one color, simply divide the juice by the amount of colors you're making and add only a few drops of coloring each time until you're happy with the resulting color.
 Do not overlap any of the sticks or the overlapping parts won't change color––keep it all one layer. Check that all the potato sticks are completely covered by the lemon juice.


Again, if you're making different colors, divide the potato sticks evenly across each color being used.
, Use a slotted spoon or similar to lift out the sticks. Lay them out on kitchen towel to drain and dry.
 When the sticks are dry and the oven is ready, spray or brush them with olive oil. Arrange the oil-coated sticks in a single layer across the baking sheet. Again, don't overlap or they won't bake evenly.


Cover the baking sheet with parchment paper to ensure that it's non-stick.
 Check regularly to ensure they're not over-cooking. About halfway during cooking, turn the fries using tongs over to cook evenly both sides. Be sure to wear an oven mitt while handling the hot baking sheet.
 Allow for a brief cooling before serving. Sprinkle with salt and any other condiments, to taste. Watch the surprise on everyone's face when they're informed that these are actually French fries!

 Concisely describe the benefits to the target audience. Consider their needs and how your offering will solve their problems or enhance their lives in some way.
 Depending on the product or service and the ad type, 2 or 3 statements or core benefits may be more effective than an exhaustive list of facts, arguments and statistics. An effective ad is generally easy to read, view or hear.


Format the ad to minimize distractions. Break up large blocks of text by using lists and subheadings, when applicable. Avoid excessive underlining and capitalizing.
Appeal to the senses. A captivating image or catchy jingle can attract and hold people's attention.

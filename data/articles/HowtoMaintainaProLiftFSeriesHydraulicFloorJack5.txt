 Locate the oil filler plug located on top of the hydraulic reservoir (cylinder). Using a flat-head screwdriver gently pry the rubber-plug out of the reservoir (Cylinder).



NOTE: The oil filler plug is typically painted the same color as the jack essentially concealing it to make it appear as part of the reservoir assembly when in fact the plug itself is a rubber press-fitted seal.

CAUTION! The hydraulic fluid located inside the reservoir could very well be under pressure when removing the plug. Insure that proper safety equipment is used when performing this step to prevent injury. Also, take necessary steps to prevent loss of the plug should the pressure eject it from the port.
 Fluid can be removed by simply tipping the jack onto its side allowing the fluid to drain from the reservoir into a suitable container.



IMPORTANT: Dispose of hydraulic fluid (used or otherwise) in accordance with local regulations.

IMPORTANT: Removal of any or all of the hydraulic fluid from the system may very well introduce air into the unit. Insure that the system is fully-bled prior to returning the jack to service.

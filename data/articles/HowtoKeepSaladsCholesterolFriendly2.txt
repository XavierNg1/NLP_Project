 Meat is high in fats and bad cholesterol, and should be put on a salad only sparingly, if at all. High-fat meats and fried meats—such as bacon—are among the least-cholesterol-friendly types of meat to put on a salad. Fatty meats are high in saturated fats and cholesterol, both of which raise the level of "bad" LDL cholesterol in your body.If you enjoy meats on your salad, opt for a leaner cut. Look at your local deli for lean cuts of meat (those that contain less fat), or purchase a package of cold-cuts that is marked “low fat.” Opt for lighter meats—such as turkey and chicken—over fatty pork and beef.
 Creamy, rich salad dressings tend to be high in fats—especially saturated fats—which will increase the levels of cholesterol on the salad.Avoid these fatty salad dressings; to check which dressings are relatively high in saturated fats, examine the nutrition facts label on the back of the salad-dressing bottle. Thinner, vinegar- and oil-based dressings—such as balsamic vinaigrette—will contain less bad cholesterol than rich, creamy dressings including ranch and blue cheese.


You can also skip the dressing altogether, and substitute a few cut-up pieces of fruit. Slice a sweet and juicy fruit (like an orange or a handful of strawberries) into bite-sized cubes and toss the fruit in with your salad.
 If you normally put shredded or crumbled cheese on your salads, you may want to reconsider. Many of the types of cheese commonly added to salads—such as feta, blue cheese, cheddar, mozzarella, and gouda — are high in saturated fats, which are directly linked to LDL cholesterol.If you’d still like to serve cheese on your salad, look at your local grocery store for cheeses marked “low fat,” as these will have fewer saturated fats and less cholesterol. Serve these cheeses in moderation on your salad.
You can also add a dollop of cottage cheese to your salad, as cottage cheese is low in cholesterol.

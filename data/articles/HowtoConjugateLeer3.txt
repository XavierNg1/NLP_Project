 Use the affirmative imperative form of leer to issue a command instructing someone to read something.


Note that there is no imperative conjugation for the singular first person "yo," or "I" in English, because you cannot issue a command to yourself.
Example: "Read the newspaper," Lee el periódico.

tú: lee
él/ella/usted: lea
nosotros/-as: leamos
vosotros/-as: leed
ellos/ellas/ustedes: lean

, When you need to tell or command someone to not read something, you would use the negative imperative, which differs from the affirmative imperative.

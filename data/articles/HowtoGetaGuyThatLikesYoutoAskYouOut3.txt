 Nothing spells death for a potential romance like getting put in the friend-zone. Sure, you want to be the cool girl who he can talk to and have a laugh with, but you don't want to become like "one of the guys." Show off your feminine side a little and make it clear, through words and body language, that you want to be more than friends.
 Letting him know that you're interested is perfectly fine, but don't take it to an extreme level. Showing up wherever he goes, hanging on his every word and bombarding him with calls and text messages is not the way to go. Maintain an air of mystery and always leave him wanting more.
 Never try to be someone you're not, just to get a guy's attention. You won't be able to keep it up, and if the girl he goes on his third date with is completely different from the girl he asked out, he'll be more than a little confused. If he doesn't like the real you, then he's not worth your attention anyway.
 Some guys are just as afraid of being rejected or getting their feelings hurt as girls are. Give the guy some time to build up his courage. Let him get to know you and see what a great person you are, he'll soon find his way.
 Maybe you're afraid that you misread the signs or that he'll change his mind once he gets to know you better. Try not to think this way. If you get the feeling that he likes you, then chances are you're right. Be positive - this could be the start of something beautiful!

 Polyurethane works well as a finish coat. It will seal the stain and protect your piano from moisture damage. Your finish coats will dry pretty quickly, but you should allow each coat to dry for at least 48 hours between applications.
 Use a fine-grade sandpaper or No. 000 steel wool to sand each thin coat of finish. (Two or three thin coats of finish will give your piano a professional sheen; it is a longer process, but is preferable to applying just 1 thick coat.)

, After you sand each application, wipe down the wood with the tack cloth so that all dust and other particles are removed before you apply the next coat of polyurethane. If you skip this step, you will likely end up with a bumpy and unsightly finish coat.

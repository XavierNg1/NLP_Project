 Baking soda can reduce the amount of oil in your hair and neutralize odors.In a bowl or glass, mix 1/4 cup of baking soda and 3/4 cup of water. It will form a paste. (Double these amounts if your hair is past your shoulders.) Wet your hair, and apply the baking soda and water mixture. Leave it in for about five minutes, and then wash your hair with shampoo. Do this about once a week. , Apply rose water directly onto your hair. Massage the rose water into your scalp. Let it soak in for 20 minutes, then wash your hair as you normally would. The rose water will leave a lingering scent of roses., Lemons are great for making your hair smell fresh, and they also fight dandruff. Shampoo your hair first. Squeeze two fresh lemons into 1 cup of water, and then massage the juice into your hair. Let it soak for up to ten minutes. Be sure to condition afterwards so that the juice doesn’t dry your hair out. Beware that lemon juice also tends to lighten your hair and bring out highlights, especially if you go out in the sun with it still in.
You can also add an essential oil to the lemon-water mixture, but it’s not necessary, since lemons already have a very strong smell.

 The chocolate will become unusable.If you do happen to introduce a bit of water into the chocolate while melting, a little bit of vegetable oil will make the chocolate more usable, but it may still be grainy.






;
, If you don't have a double boiler, you can easily place a light, non-plastic bowl set over a pot of lightly steaming water. The steam will slowly heat the chocolate above.









Make sure not to let the bottom of the bowl (holding the chocolate) have contact with the steaming or boiling water. Contact with the water may cause the bowl to grow too warm, burning the chocolate instead of melting it.
The chocolate will melt faster if it is broken up into smaller pieces.
 Because chocolate is very easily burned, be careful not to leave the room or stop stirring for too long.
 Adjust the heat on the stove if you believe the chocolate is melting too quickly. The whole process should take anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes.

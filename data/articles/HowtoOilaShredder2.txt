 Purchase the oil recommended for your paper shredder by the manufacturer. Different shredders will use different oils and will usually sell the oil where you purchased your shredder.


If you are using an old and/or out of warranty paper shredder, you can use canola oil as a substitute rather than purchasing oil. The oil produced by some brands is actually just repackaged canola oil so you can save a little money by using canola oil.
 Setting the shredder to manual mode allows you to control the direction that the blades are rotating and the length of time that they are moving. You will need this for oiling the paper.
 While the paper shredder is off, squirt a line of oil lengthwise across the paper entry. This puts oil along the entire length of the blades., Start the paper shredder in the reverse direction and keep it in motion for 10-20 seconds before stopping the blades. This way the oil is spread and redistributed around to the entire cutting assembly.
 Turn off manual mode and restart the machine in automatic mode for normal use.
 Pass at least two or three more pieces of paper into the shredder so that they absorb the extra oil left on the blades.

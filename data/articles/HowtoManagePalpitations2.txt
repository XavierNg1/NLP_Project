 Some conditions that are not related to the heart (noncardiac) can cause heart palpitations. If you think you may have a condition that is causing your palpitations, it is important to talk to your doctor about what you can do to treat the condition. Noncardiac conditions that can lead to palpitations include:


Anemia.
Anxiety.
Beta-blocker withdrawal.
Pregnancy.
Hypoglycemia.
Mastocytosis.
Some medications.
 Cardiac conditions are conditions that involve your heart. Your doctor will create a prescribed plan for you to follow to treat or manage these conditions.


The next step will describe some of the recommendations or requirements your doctor may prescribe for you so that you can keep your palpitations to a minimum.
 As mentioned above, if you have a cardiac condition that can cause palpitations, you will have to create a management plan with your doctor. This management plan may involve things like:


Avoid substances and drugs that cause palpitations, like caffeine, alcohol or cocaine.
If you have tachycardia, your doctor may advise you to take rate controlling drugs like beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers.
Your doctor may advise you to take anti-arrhythmic medications to control arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) and to prevent their occurrence in future.
Depending on your diagnosis, your doctor may advise you to use ‘Pill in the pocket strategy’. This means that he or she may prescribe you drugs that are supposed to be kept in your pocket always, and taken once you feel palpitations.
Some arrhythmias are due to structural problems in the electrical pathways of heart (called accessory pathways). In such cases, your doctor may advise you to get these structural problems corrected by advanced medical techniques like catheter ablation.

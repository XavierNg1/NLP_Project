 In between soaking your foot in the vinegar mix, make sure that the area stays clean and dry. The fungus that causes athlete’s foot loves moist areas, so having damp feet can mean that the infection will get worse or will come back.


A great way to keep your feet dry is to wear socks made of natural fabrics or fabrics that wick moisture away from your feet. Change your socks if they get wet.
Consider wearing sandals or flip-flops in hot weather.
Wear shower shoes, flip-flops or sandals around pools, gyms, hotel rooms, and shower or locker areas.
 Fungus is a pesky organism that won’t go away without a fight. It stays in your shoes and on your towels after your infected foot has touched them. Because of this, it is important to disinfect anything that your foot has touched while it has been infected. Rinse your shoes (yes, even the inside) with water and let them air dry in the sun. After they have dried, sprinkle anti-fungal powder into them to make sure that the fungus doesn’t come back.
 Athlete's foot occurs most often due to a combination of sweaty feet and tight-fitting, confining shoes.Don’t buy shoes that feel too tight and hope they will stretch out. To prevent athlete’s foot, you want shoes that are both long and wide enough.
 This will ensure that your shoes are dry when you put them on.
 As mentioned above, this kind of fungus loves moisture. When you have athlete’s foot and take a shower, some of the fungus will stay in the shower, which means it can infect your foot again as soon as you take another shower. Because of this, you should disinfect your tub or shower. Put on some gloves and use bleach or apple cider vinegar to scrub the floor in your shower. Once you are done, throw the gloves and sponge you used to clean into the trash.

 Saying "I love you" is a big step, and before you say those magic words, you need to make sure you mean it. You may be feeling infatuated, obsessed, or smitten with your boyfriend, but how do you know that what you're feeling is truly love? Here are some signs that you are truly in love:


If nothing feels as good as it does when you're with your significant other. If he has a way of putting you at ease and making you feel amazing for who you are.
If you can't imagine your future without him.
If you can be yourself completely around him.
If you are realistic about who your boyfriend is. If you are able to accept his flaws instead of thinking he's absolutely perfect, this is a sign that you may be in love.;
, Though you're not a mind reader, you may have a sense that he also loves you, or you wouldn't consider telling him such big news. You won't be able to know if he loves you for sure until you tell him, but there are a few things you can consider to get a better sense of how he feels. Here are some signs that he may share your feelings:


If he's always complimenting you, telling you how amazing you are, and saying that he's never met a person like you, then he may be falling for you.
If he can't keep his hands off of you and always wants to be around you. Make sure he is feeling love, not lust -- it's easy to confuse the two. If he's addicted to your mind and your personality and not just your body, then he may be falling for you.
If you often catch him staring at you with a dopey, sweet expression. Bonus points if he blushes and turns away when you catch him.

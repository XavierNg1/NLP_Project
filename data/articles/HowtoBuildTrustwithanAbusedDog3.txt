 You want to reinforce positive behavior instead of punishment because most dogs understand the connection between actions and rewards more clearly than what they are being punished for.


Never hit a dog. If you don't like something the dog is doing a simple and calm "no" or Uh-uh will usually suffice.
 It works by conditioning the dog to get closer and closer to things it fears by luring it close with something it loves.


For example, if your dog is afraid of bicycles, you place your dogs favorite toy or a treat close to a bicycle. After the dog takes the bait, you gradually (over days or weeks) move the treat or toy closer to the feared item.
 This may go slowly if you have just adopted an abused dog. Just remember that if you build enough trust between you and the dog, it will eventually want to follow your command.


Begin with "sit" and "come" commands. These will set the foundation for further training, such as "heel," "lay," and a wide variety of others.
 An abused dog has gone through a lot of trauma and deserves some time and patience from you. It's fine to have some behavior expectations but don't be unrealistic. The dog doesn't have any reason to trust you, as they may have had strictly bad relationships with humans. Give your pup some time and show it everyday that your are trustworthy.

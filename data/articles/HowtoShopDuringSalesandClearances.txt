,, As we all know, "the early bird gets the worm.", For example, early fall or late summer is the best time to buy swim suits. Stores will have loads of suits that they will have to store over the winter, taking up space. They will often mark down seasonal things like this after the time when they are most popular.
 But if you don't want to deal with the crowds taking what you want, go a few days after Christmas/Thanksgiving. Often, the things will still be on sale, and there will be less people. Also, go after less important holidays. Sales end then!

, You know those little things that come in the mail, for a free pizza or a 60% off coupon? Save those! If it's a store you never go to, you can give them to other people or try to make a special trip. Those coupons add up after awhile!

, Labor Day Sale, Presidents' Day Sale, stores love to put things on sale! But consider this. Instead of going to that store during the sale, go after the sale. Often, the item will be on clearance where you can get it up to half the sale price. Stores figure that if you are not going to buy it during the sale, you're never going to buy it. So they put it on clearance. Use this to your advantage.
 Which, of course, is a great thing! They try to get rid of the things that they have because no one wants to be stuck with it after the store closes. After it's already closed, often you can go to stores like Goodwill and purchase clothes from the store.
 You may be thinking "Ew... second hand clothes!" Well, not necessarily. Often stores like Aeropostale and Hollister give Goodwill the clothes that they don't sell. You'd be surprised, a lot of the things at Goodwill still have the price tag on them!

, For some stores that are open for 24 hours, like Walmart, their sales won't start until a certain time. If the sale time starts at 5:00 AM, go at 3:00 AM, do all of your shopping and then check out at 5:00 AM, when the sales have been enacted.

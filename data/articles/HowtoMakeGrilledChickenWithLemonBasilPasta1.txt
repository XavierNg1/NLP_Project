To grill the chicken, light your grill and leave it on high. Oil the grates on your grill while it is heating up. Put a few tablespoons of cooking oil in a small bow. Dip a pastry brush into the oil and brush the grates with the oil. This will help prevent the chicken breasts from sticking to the grates. Arrange the chicken breasts on the hottest part of your grates and let them cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Use your grill tongs to lift the chicken pieces and turn them over. Continue to grill the chicken pieces for another 2 to 3 minutes. Test for doneness by inserting a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the meat. Your chicken is done when the internal temperature on your meat thermometer registers 165°F (75°C).
To broil the chicken, adjust the broiler rack on your stove so that the broiler pan with the chicken pieces on it will be about 6 inches (15.2 cm) beneath the stove’s coils or flame. Turn the broiler on and let it preheat while you prepare the chicken breasts for broiling. Oil your broiler pan with cooking oil. You can brush the oil on with a pastry brush or apply the oil with a folded paper towel. Arrange the chicken breasts on the broiler pan. Slide the pan into the broiler and broil the chicken for 8 to 10 minutes. Use long-handled tongs to turn the chicken over and broil the chicken pieces on the other side for another 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the broiler pan from the oven and place it on top of the stove. Test for doneness by inserting a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the meat. Your chicken is done when the internal temperature on your meat thermometer registers 165°F (75°C).

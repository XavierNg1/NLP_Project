 Set your colors to the default black outline with no fill. Use the rectangle tool to make the first part. Set a square to be 670 px x 670 px. Color this using the gradient tool. Set the colors to the following--first color at position C = 0, M = 0, Y = 0, K = 25; second color at position C = 0, M = 0, Y = 0, K = 12.5; third color at position C = 0, M = 0, Y = 0, K = 50. Set the stroke to "none" and then select "linear mode.";
, Select a top one and position it as shown on in the image. Select both and then go to Pathfinder > Compound Shapes > Subtract. Position this on the bottom of the first part.
 Choose the ellipse tool and click once on the page to open the options. Set the size of the ellipse to 490 px x 490 px and click "OK" to create the ellipse. Set the colors to the following--first color at position C = 0, M = 0, Y = 0, K = 12; second color at position C = 0, M = 0, Y = 0, K = 48 and then set the stroke to "none" and use radial mode. Select all of parts, then choose Object > Group.
 Color this piece by using the gradient tool. Set the first color at position C = 19, M =4, Y = 12, K = 0.5; second color at position C = 55, M = 0, Y = 14, K = 0; third color at position, C = 90, M = 0, Y = 7, K = 50. Set the stroke to "none" and use radial mode.
 Set the size of the ellipse to 275 px wide x 160 px tall. Use a linear gradient and set first color at position C = 0, M = 0, Y = 0, K = 0; second color at position C = 0, M = 90, Y = 0, K = 7. Set the stroke to "none." Position this part on the top of the second button part.
 Create a new ellipse and make it the same size as a second button part. Create another one at 700 px wide x 485 px tall and position it as shown on the illustration.

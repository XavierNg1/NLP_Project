 Bring the upper right corner diagonally down and to the left.


The left edge of the fold should be flush to the left edge of the note.
 Fold the right edge over so that it meets and lines up with the left edge.


The lower edge of your previous fold should lie beneath your newest fold.
 Turn the paper over to the back. Fold the bottom edge up, using roughly 1/3 of the total height of the paper.
 You should use another 1/3 of the paper.


The resulting shape will look like a triangle sitting on top of a rectangle. The bottom corner of the triangle should rest just past the mid-point of the rectangle's upper edge.
 The upper tip of the triangle should meet the lower edge of the rectangle.


Don't worry if the tip falls just short of the lower edge. The note can still be completed even if this occurs.
 Fold the tip of the triangle into the diagonal that lies across the rectangle. Crease well to secure.


This step completes your basic rectangle fold.

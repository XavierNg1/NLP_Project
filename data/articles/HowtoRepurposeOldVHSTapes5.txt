 Cut out the tape and hang from tree branches, walls, sticks, poles, etc. to scare off birds trying to come into your garden.Make sure the tape is tied on securely so that it can't fly away and be accidentally ingested by wildlife. Dispose of properly (in a garbage can) when it becomes tatty, as it cannot be composted or simply left to rot outdoors.

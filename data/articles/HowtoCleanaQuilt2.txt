 Support the weight of the wet quilt as you transport it. Hold it like a baby, and don’t pull on any one section of the fabric.If the weight isn’t properly supported, threads in the quilt may pop., This works for new, well-made, quality fabric quilts.You can dry the quilt completely. Alternately, dry it partially and then lay it flat on a rack or outside to dry.Don’t iron your quilt, or put it in direct sunlight.
 You can air out your quilt outside to dry it, if it’s dusty, or if it has an odor. Find an area in the shade, since direct sunlight can fade fabric. Hang it on a balcony or clothesline, or spread it out on the ground. If you spread it on the ground, place a bedsheet underneath it and another on top of it. Weigh the corners down.You can also air dry a quilt on a balcony by laying down a mattress pad and spreading the quilt out on top of it. If birds are a concern, spread another mattress pad on top. Turn the quilt over when the top is nearly dry., If the weather isn’t appropriate for outdoor drying, line dry the quilt by placing it flat on a rack. Alternately, place a few mattress pads on a bed (at least one of them should be waterproof). Set up a fan to blow horizontally towards the quilt for about a day.

 Now that you’ve done all of the necessary stretches, you can work on actually reaching those toes. Begin by laying flat on the floor with your toes pointed up.
 This may look as though you’re reaching for the ceiling, but some people find it easier to lower into the stretch with their arms rather than lunge them forward toward their feet.
 Stretch farther forward the way you would at the top of a sit up but without returning to the ground.
 Now that you’ve reached the full extension of your stretch, you should be able to touch your toes. However, don’t strain if you can’t. It can take several weeks or more of these various stretches before you can actually reach your toes.
 Hold the position for as long as you can without straining up to 30 seconds. You may also choose to repeat touching your toes multiples times as part of your exercise routine.









Always perform the exercise in a controlled, steady fashion and without darting your hands toward your feet because that will only lead to strains.

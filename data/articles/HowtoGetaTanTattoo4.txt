 This method is similar to the “sticker method” in that the tattoo application area should be clean. They are similar in that you need the skin to be clean and dry to get the sticker and the polish to adhere to the skin. Dry the area well before moving on to the next step.
 You can use a stencil if you need to, or you can make one with a sheet of paper as mentioned above in the “sticker method.” Make sure your design is neat when you apply it. Remember your tattoo will take the exact shape of the nail polish, so be exact.


Don’t use a clear polish because the light will still shine through, but beware of using a polish so dark that it stains your skin. Try using an opaque shade that doesn’t stain your nails. Hopefully, it won’t stain your skin either., You don’t want the sunlight shining through the polish and tanning the area designated for your tan tattoo. Hang out inside for a bit while the polish dries.
 While you are waiting for your tan tattoo to appear, go relax in the sun. Read a magazine. Sit by the pool, or sleep for 20 minutes. Don’t touch the nail polish in case it is tacky; it will smear and mess up your design. Peel the nail polish off after tanning, and your simple tattoo design will appear.

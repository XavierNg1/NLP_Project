 As you read, jot down important biological concepts and details. Your reading notes do not have to be organized at first, as long as you can go back and understand what you wrote. Also, write down any questions you have or things that you do not understand in your biology chapter.For example, if you come across a word you don’t know (e.g. lipid), write it down.
 Writing out the concepts covered in a graph or image is a great way to check your understanding. Make notes of the graphs and images that are covered in your text. You can also draw any images that you would like to have in your notes.


Diagrams of particular structures, like the golgi apparatus, would be good images to redraw in your notes.
 After you read the entire chapter, you should revise your notes. Rewrite all of your reading notes in complete sentences and organized bullet points. Add your diagrams and/or image summaries in with the concepts that they explain. Be sure to put everything in your own words., Put your notes into folders based on subject matter. It may help to even color code the folders. Break the notes down into flashcards with a question on one side and an answer on the other. You can also make flashcards with a term or image on one side and the definition or explanation on the other. These tools will help you understand the chapter you read more completely.


A colored folder system might use a green folder for things related to genetics, a red folder for cell structures, and a yellow folder for metabolism.
A note card might have the word “Anaphase” on one side and a description of what happens during anaphase on the other side.

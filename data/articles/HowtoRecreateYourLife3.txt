 Your feelings are a guide to what is good and bad in your life. If something is making you angry, then figure out why and resolve the situation instead of pushing it away.
 Don't accept something inappropriate just because you don't want to shake up the status quo. Avoid telling someone that you feel one thing when you feel the opposite.
 If you expect others to act a certain way, then act according to the same standards in your own life.
 If you want a certain characteristic in a partner, then stop settling for relationships that don't meet your needs. If you want to take care of your body, then stop eating foods that make you unhealthy.
 Seek forgiveness for wrongs you've done that still bother you a great deal.


The only exception to this rule would be if you have done thing egregious or illegal to someone that would be very traumatic for the other person to relive. In a case like this, you'll have to settle for forgiving yourself.
Avoid cowardice. If you know that you've done something wrong and that you've never apologized, write the offended person a letter or call them. The other person may or may not respond positively, but you've done what you needed to do to try to right the wrong.

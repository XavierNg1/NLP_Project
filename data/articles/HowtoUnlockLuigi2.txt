 In the first Super Mario Galaxy game from 2007, Luigi takes a lot of effort to unlock. To get started, keep playing as Mario until you have at least 60 stars, then ask Rosalina to let you fight Bowser. You must defeat Bowser in order to succeed on the next step.
 Once Bowser is defeated, a number appears next to Rosalina showing you how many stars you have left to collect, out of the 120 total. Once you've got all 120 stars, the number next to Rosalina will be 0.


There are quite a few hidden stars throughout the galaxies. You can follow detailed guides, or try to explore, smash, collect, and play with everything you find to discover them yourself.
 After all that effort, return to Rosalina and defeat Bowser again. At the end of the credits, Luigi will be unlocked.
 Luigi is faster and more powerful than Mario, but begins again in a new save file with 0 stars and nothing unlocked. If you manage to collect all 120 stars again while playing as Luigi, you'll unlock a final secret galaxy to play through., In the 2010 Galaxy sequel, Luigi will show up occasionally at the start of some levels, but only once you have approximately 30 stars. You can talk to Luigi to play as him for that level only.


Beating a level with Luigi will cause an extra-fast "Luigi ghost" to appear whenever you visit the level again. Touch the ghost to set it moving. There are no rewards for beating a level more quickly than the ghost, but you might like the challenge.
 Once you complete the final level of World 6, a special door will open in the forehead of the Mario spaceship. Enter the door to unlock the ability to play as Luigi on any level.

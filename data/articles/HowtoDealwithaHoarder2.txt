 Collectors are people who acquire specific items. Collectors will often display these items in an organized manner. Hoarders, on the other hand, save random items and create hazardous mounds of clutter.


People who collect one type of thing—like dolls, stamps, antique end tables, figurines, etc—and organizes them in a particular way are not hoarders; they are collectors.
Do not let your own feelings about cleanliness, organization, and whether to keep important or significant items influence you to label someone who is disorganized or a collector as a hoarder., Living with a hoarder can be especially difficult, as he may become upset any time you try to clean or organize. It may be particularly difficult to get a hoarder with whom you live to assist in cleaning out clutter.
 You need to remind the hoarder that you both share a living environment. Emphasize making improvements to “our” living environment. Try not to separate “his things” from the shared space of the home.
 If your loved one is adamant that he “needs” to keep all of his things, try to establish acceptable limits in shared spaces. You may want to keep common spaces such as the living room and kitchen free of clutter, designating a particular room or rooms for storage.


You can provide space for your loved one’s things while addressing your concerns about the hoarding and maintaining your own need for a less cluttered environment.
 Discarding belongings, even if you view them as junk, can create a rift between you and your loved one. It can cause you to lose any ground you’ve made in helping the hoarder become more organized.

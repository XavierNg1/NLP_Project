 Sift through jewelry boxes or even troll antique stores or garage sales for pieces. Have an idea of how you’d like the mobile to be structured before selecting pieces so you can assign areas for appropriate items.


Consider integrating other found objects into your design. For example, you could anchor each mobile strand with antique doorknobs or oversize buttons. You don’t have to stick only to jewelry.
Look for opportunities to string the jewelry and other pieces. Some pieces may have loops or hoops that can be strung. In some cases you may need to drill a small hole through the jewelry or item so it can be strung.;
, For larger rooms you’ll want to go grander to make a statement and not have the mobile get lost in the room. However, smaller, two or three strand mobiles may be ideal.
 For example, you could use a beautiful Birch tree branch or even an antique hanger. Consider integrating an item that not only enhances your room but helps the mobile tell a story.


Make sure you have a mechanism that will allow you to hang the base in a room. If necessary add a hook or hanger to the top of the base.
 Mobiles can be made out of a variety of materials so choosing the strands that will hold your jewelry and hang from the mobile are extremely important. Consider fishing wire, ribbon, thread, yarn, clothing scraps and wire.

 Even if the label on your shirt says "pre-shrunk," it would still be a good idea to wash it. This will remove any potential starch or stiffener that might prevent the paint from sticking properly.;
, Spread some newspaper on a table, and get anything that might get ruined out of the way. It might also be a good idea to have some paper towels (for blotting) and a cup of water (for rinsing the paintbrush) handy as well.
 The cardboard should be about the same size as the shirt. You want it to slip inside the shirt easily without stretching it. This will prevent the paint from bleeding onto the back of the shirt.


You can also use a folded up newspaper for this. Even an old magazine or catalogue will do in a pinch.
 If you are nervous about free-handing the design, you can always trace your design first using a stencil and a permanent marker, and then fill it in. Consider using a few paintbrushes in different shapes and sizes; a flat brush will give you some nice, crisp edges while a pointy brush is great for detail.


If you want your design to have multiple colors, such as a smiles face, do the background color first. Let the paint dry, then do the details.
Try to get paint brushes meant for painting fabric. They usually have stiffer bristles made from taklon. Avoid natural brushes, such as camel hair, as they will be too soft to hold the thick paint and create nice designs.
 If you'd like, you can speed up the drying process by blowing the paint with a hair dryer. Do not remove the cardboard inside the shirt until the paint is completely dry.


Once the paint dries, you can flip it around and paint the back as well. Keep the cardboard inside the shirt and let the paint dry.
 If the paint is sticking to the cardboard, don't panic. Simply wiggle your finger between the shirt and the cardboard to pry it apart. Discard the cardboard when you are done, or save it for another project.

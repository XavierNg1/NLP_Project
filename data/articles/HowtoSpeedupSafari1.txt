Find the Safari Library folder on your user directory. Safari stores bookmarks, downloads, history, favicons, and other data in this folder and checks it every time you attempt to launch the browser. If the cache is congested, launch time will increase. The "icons" file within the folder is usually the biggest problem.;
,


Locate the property list file (.plist) under the Safari Library folder's preferences. Deleting this file entirely can speed up your launch time, but it also might disable a few browsing preferences.



Remove third-party products that launch along with Safari, potentially slowing down the process. Delete these programs by uninstalling them with your Add/Remove Programs manager in Windows or by dragging the application to the trash on Mac OS. Follow any uninstall wizards and restart your system to guarantee removal.

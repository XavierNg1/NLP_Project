 If you have a distortion pedal plugged into the amp, that could be the source of the feedback you're hearing. Distortion or effect pedals can create feedback when the effects are turned too high. Try turning down both the level and the gain knobs.


Certain pedals are capable of creating more feedback. Overdrive effects for heavy metal or hardcore music have a greater chance of creating unintended feedback than a blues or jazz pedal because of the intended sound.
Try unplugging your guitar from the pedal and plug your guitar directly into the amp. If there is no feedback, then the pedal is your culprit.
 If you have an equalizer, you can turn down the frequency range for the guitar that you have plugged in. This will effectively eliminate all feedback because it wonâ€™t register through the equalizer.External or add-on equalizers may be more effective at eliminating your feedback. Depending on the quality of your amplifier, an external component may be better quality than the one that comes with your amp.
Electric guitar frequency range is 80 Hz to about 1200 Hz.You may have to test different frequencies for your specific guitar.
Lower the frequency by turning the knob counter-clockwise within your range.
 A noise suppressor is made to eliminate feedback, humming, and any other unwanted noise that is coming from your amp. This pedal does not affect the guitar's natural tone, but does cost money. If you absolutely can not get rid of your feedback, or want a cleaner sound on your guitar, this is an option.


Turn the noise reduction knob clockwise to reduce the ambient sound and feedback from the guitar.
Play with the threshold knob until you do not hear static from your amp. You have to find the level for your specific guitar and amp.

 CIDP is rare autoimmune condition that causes the body to fight against its own tissues. CIDP causes the body to attack the myelin sheaths that protect nerves, ultimately leading to nerve damage.CIDP often manifests as motor and sensory dysfunction.


Motor deficits (such as weakness, difficulty walking) are reported in 94% of CIDP patients.
Sensory deficits (such as numbness, poor balance) are reported in 89% of CIDP patients.
 In 5-35% of CIDP patients, sensory symptoms will occur predominantly, with little to no motor deficits. On the opposite side, 7-10% of CIDP patients (more often patients under the age of 20) experience motor-related symptoms, with little to no sensory deficits., Lewis-Sumner syndrome (LSS)--also known as multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM)â€”presents in 6-15% of CIDP patients. This form of CIDP is characterized by asymmetry, where symptoms affect one part of the body (usually the upper body/upper limbs) more than others., Although the exact cause of CIDP is still unknown, this condition is treatable. Particularly when the condition is diagnosed early on, many patients experience remission and recovery from symptoms without long-term nerve damage.Your treatment plan will be based on the specific brand of CIDP you are experiencing, your symptoms, and any other conditions you may have.Some forms of CIDP treatment include:


Corticosteroids, such as prednisone
Immunosuppressant drugs
Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange)
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy
Physiotherapy

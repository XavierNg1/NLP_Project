 One that is big enough so that it can contain many folders is preferable. It must also be a type of program that doesn't get used very often or not at all so that very little to no attention is paid to its files.;
, Explore through the folders. Try to find a spot where there are at least 15-20 folders of nondescript names (e.g., ea, eb, ec).
, Make up a nondescript name, one that uses a combination of characters unlikely for someone to search, such as "t4y". Now press ENTER. This will make all of the files named as such, save for a (digit) at the front of each.


If you wish to name your files in a way that you can recognize them, then use an acronym like you would for a a passport. For example: "drag car racing two" (yeah, you'd probably be hiding something completely different...), name it dcr2, or something someone is unlikely to check out.
 Now all of your files and folders are completely invisible, and traces of their use will mostly be incoherent gibberish to someone browsing, and easily gotten rid of after that (see tips).
 Check the "show hidden files" box.
 Check "Delete files after archiving", compression speed to taste. Now go to "Advanced", then "Set password". Check "encrypt file names" and then set the password to whatever you like. Click "OK", and now you will have all your hidden files neatly packed away in a non-descript rar file.

 See where or when he's going to grab you or try to punch you.;
, Like you'll see when he punches left or right. You'll see when he is about to attack.
 Since he's so big, you will only see it for a brief second. So once you see it you got to do the opposite.
 He goes right you go left. This is when you don't do the opposite. He goes for a grab you also go for a grab.
 Once you do that then he goes down like a ton of bricks.

 To steam clean your panini grill, you’ll need to use the heat from the grill itself. If you are cleaning it immediately after using it, you should be able to use the residual heat from the grill. If you are cleaning it after not having used it, turn it on to the lowest heat setting., To steam clean your grill, you’ll need to completely soaked towel or rag. Soak a rag in clean, clear water until it drips. Don’t ring it out before you place it on the grill.Since you’ll be laying this cloth on your grill and closing the lid while the grill is on, the cloth must be completely soaked. Otherwise you risk burning the rag and causing damage to your grill.
 Lay the soaked cloth on the bottom portion of the panini grill. It should completely cover the bottom grill to ensure that the entire grill is steamed. Be sure to keep the cloth away from any exposed electrical components., You’ll hear sizzling sounds when the grill closes and the wet rag meets the hot top of the grill. Check that the cloth is placed so that it it covers the entirety of the bottom and top parts of the grill., Stay near the grill and keep an eye on it. You should see some steam, but if you see or smell smoke, remove the rag immediately., Open the grill and remove the cloth after five minutes. Most of the caked on residue should now be easier to remove. Allow the grill to cool slightly (but not too much, as this will cause the residue to harden again). Then dip a cloth in clean, clear water, and wipe down both portions of the grill, starting with the top.You can also use the baking soda solution for this step if it has been quite some time since you cleaned your grill.

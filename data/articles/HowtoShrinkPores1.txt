 Buildup from makeup is often responsible for clogging pores. The first step in the exfoliation process is to remove it.


Try to find a natural makeup remover, if possible. The chemicals in many makeup removers can dry out your skin, causing it to flake and increasing the need for exfoliation.;
, There's no need to use any special facial cleanser to unclog your pores. In fact, soaps, perfumes and other ingredients might actually exacerbate the problem by inflaming your skin.


Make sure the water is warm, not hot. Again, reddening and inflaming the skin is not necessary, and not good for reducing the appearance of pores.
Pat your face dry with a soft towel. Don't scrub it, or you may damage your skin, which is more sensitive on your face than other parts of your body.
 Exfoliating skin removes dead skin cells and oils that clog your pores. Consider these different types of exfoliants, and use one as often as needed:

A dry facial brush. Buy a small, soft brush made with natural fibers and use it to gently brush your face. Your face and the brush should both be dry. Use swift, short strokes to brush away flakes around your eyes, cheeks and chin.






Use an exfoliating product. Many creams, gels and cleansers come mixed with small particles that exfoliate the skin. Use these sparingly, since the other ingredients may inflame your skin.







Make your own facial scrub. Sugar, honey and green tea can go a long way toward making your skin glow. These ingredients are gentle on your skin and shouldn't cause inflammation.
 After you're finished exfoliating, apply a light moisturizer or facial oil, like rose hip oil. This will keep your skin from getting dried out and irritated, helping to reduce the appearance of pores.

 Don't drag work home over the weekend if possible. The weekend should give you a break from work, not be a continuation of it. If you work over the weekend, your work weeks will run into each other, you'll start to experience burn out. Take a break to give yourself some time to regain your sanity., If you notice that you know more about your colleagues' lives than you do about your spouse's or friends' lives, you may be spending too much time at work. Take a step back, and commit to spending more time developing your relationships outside of work.One way to accomplish this goal is to ask if you can work from home one day a week. You'll at least cut down on your commuting time, giving you some more time with your family.
The same holds true for school or for stay-at-home parents. You don't want your whole life to become school or your kids. You need your own life and sense of self outside of those parts of your life, despite how important they are.
 That is, go to bed early on Sunday night and make sure you ready yourself for the week ahead. You don't want to start the week by feeling tired or drowsy., You know it's important to have a sleep schedule; it lets your body know when to be ready for bed and when to get up. You may be tempted to skip the schedule on the weekends, but that only throws your body clock off and makes you drowsy come Monday morning. Try to go to sleep and get up at about the same time on the weekends., Whether it's a new necktie or a sparkly pair of earrings, choose something to wear on Monday that makes you perk up., Exercise will naturally boost your mood and has the added benefit of helping you sleep better.

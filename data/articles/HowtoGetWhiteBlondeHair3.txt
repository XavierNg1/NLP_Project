 If you have dark hair, and you do not have much experience dying it yourself, seeking a professional stylist is the best way to dye it white blonde and ensure you safely achieve the desired shade.
 The cost to dye your hair white blonde varies by how drastic the change will be. Expect to pay between $60 and $200.


The longer, darker and thicker the hair, the longer it will take to dye white blonde and the more a salon is likely to charge you.
 Hair salons vary in price and quality, but paying a higher price doesn’t always ensure a higher quality service.


Be sure to read online reviews of hairstylists and talk to people whose hair color you admire. Ask them who they use. You’re better off finding a specific person than a general salon.
 Good hair stylists usually book weeks or even months in advance, so call ahead of time to ensure an appointment.


Describe your hair as it is now and what you would like it to look like it to look like. Your hairstylist needs to be aware of how long the color treatment will take.
Even if your stylist does not give you a time estimate, make sure that you leave ample time to dye your hair. The process can take anywhere from two to four hours, especially if your hairstylists is attending to other clients in between your processes.
Agree on a price over the phone so that you have a clear understanding of how much the color treatment will cost before you walk into the salon.
 It is very helpful for your hairstylist to see a picture of how you want your hair to look. Consider finding a photo in a magazine, printing one out or having one on your phone to show him or her.

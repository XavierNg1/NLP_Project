, Flashing parties can be hosted by jammers who really do flash jammers. At flashing parties, you are also likely to get scammed since flash trading is a type of scam.
 Many jammers (or scammers) know that you cannot say "flash me" because a sign will come up saying about scamming. This caused them to start saying things similar to "flash" (such as "flesh"). However, they realise that they are actually saying "flash me".
 The accept and decline buttons usually pop up after 5 seconds, and, somehow, there is a rare occurrence for a Jammer to have something called auto accept. Jammers with auto accept "come" when the accept and decline buttons instantly pop up (this happens when the trade starts), but it is very rare.
 If you put bad items on trade, (Such as necklaces, leis, or anything that can be bought for very cheap in Jam mart clothing!


Add a few Rare Item Mondays to your list. You might get some good trades.
Put in a few other things. You'll get more trades. Or, put in your best things for trade. If you like the trade, you can always accept.
Put a few betas on your list, such as gecko plushies and maybe a Cami's frog. Even though they are still purchasable, Necklaces and Welcome Mats are also betas because they have been in Animal Jam since the beta stage.

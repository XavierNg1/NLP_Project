Going to support groups.
Using a nicotine patch.
Talking to your doctor about other medications you can take to help break the habit.
 Try to exercise often, but always stop if you are having difficulty breathing. Exercising can help to strengthen your lungs. Try simple exercises like walking every morning.


You could try walking 10 to 20 minutes every morning to try to strengthen your lungs.

Green leafy vegetables like spinach, cabbage, turnip greens, and lettuce.
Fruits like apricots, apples, bananas, blueberries, plums, pineapples, and melons.

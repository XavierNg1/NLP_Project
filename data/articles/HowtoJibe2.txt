 Alert your crew that you want to jibe. Letting them know will allow them to do their part in preparing and moving the sails. It will also signal them to steer clear of the mainsail and the boom, which will be coming across the boat.Alternatively, you can say "Prepare to jibe."

, The crew member assigned to moving the sails, or the sail trimmer, should get into position and prepare the mainsail for the jibe before responding with "Ready." Once they are in position, they should respond with this verbal command to let the captain of the boat know that they are ready to move the sail. Typically, you'll have more than one crew member on the ship, but you only really need two people to jibe the boat., Jibe-ho will let the rest of the crew know that you are starting to jibe the boat. At this point, the crew can start the mainsail to the other side of the boat and you can begin to turn your boat downwind.

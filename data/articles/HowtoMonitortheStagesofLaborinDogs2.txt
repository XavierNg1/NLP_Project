 Prior to active labor, the dog may develop a change in eating habits. For example, on the day of whelping female dogs may not eat or they may eat and then later vomit. Although loss of appetite is fairly common, it does not happen to all dogs. Some dogs will continue to eat right up until active labor and delivery.A loss of appetite in the latter stages of pregnancy is likely a sign of stage one labor.
 Dogs, in the early stages of labor, will also become quite restless and they may begin pacing, whining, and looking at their abdomen. This is very typical and essentially demonstrates their discomfort as they begin to experience irregular contractions. During the first stage of labor you will likely not be able to see the contractions, but the dog is preparing for delivery. This change in behavior is a clear sign that labor has begun.You can comfort your dog by saying soothing words and being present.
Avoid being overly affectionate and touchy during this stage. The dog likely wants some space.
 Your dog will also begin to nest during this stage of labor. They will look for a comfortable place to deliver their puppies. This is one of the few times when you should interfere with the delivery process. You can help your dog nest by building a whelping box for them. Add lots of blankets to the space in order to make it comfortable for the laboring dog. You can also add some of their favorite toys to encourage them to use the box. Introduce the whelping box a week prior to delivery so that the dog becomes comfortable with the space.Place the box in a quiet, warm, and traffic-free space in your home.
By helping your dog with the nesting process you can control where the delivery will take place.
For example, you may not want your dog to deliver on your bed!

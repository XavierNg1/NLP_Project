 Too much heat can damage boots, so never hold the hairdryer against them or heat them too long. This method is good for making your boot more comfortable, but cannot stretch it to a new size.
 A second pair of socks will allow for greater stretch. You won't need to wear the boots for long, so don't worry too much about hurting your feet.
 Aim the hair dryer at the area of the boot that needs stretching. Hold it a few inches (about 10 cm) away from the boot and only turn it on for a few seconds.Move your foot around inside the boot or curl and stretch your toes for better stretching.
 Walk until the boots have lost the heat from the hair dryer.


If it's painful to walk in the boots, remain seated and stretch them by flexing your toes and foot.
 If the boots have not stretched enough, heat and walk again.
 Heat can dry out leather and make it brittle, so apply a leather conditioner afterward if using this method on leather boots.


There's no need to moisturize synthetic material such as vinyl.

 If you don't care about sounding like a real French speaker and you just want to be able to describe the book and musical in English without embarrassing yourself, your job is much easier. The first step is the same for this alternate pronunciation: just say "lay."

, This sounds like the word "miss," only with a soft s sound. The syllable should rhyme with the word "whizz." You can omit the long e sound you'd normally use in French here.
 This syllable should rhyme with "whirr" or "burr". Feel free to use the standard English "hard r" sound here.
 The last syllable should rhyme with "blob" or "mob." Don't bother with the "les" at the end this time â€” at this point, you've already established that you're not a native French speaker, so trying to add it back in won't help.
 That's all you need to pronounce "Les Miserables" in the anglicized way. Simply string the syllables above together and sound them out: "lay mizzerrobb." Unless you're actually trying to speak proper French, there's no need to be ashamed of this anglicized pronunciation, as it's the way most English speakers choose to say the words.


Even with this easier pronunciation in wide use, some English speakers still use different pronunciations of "Les Miserables." See this video for a humorous rundown of the ways that Americans, British people, and actual French speakers pronounce the word.

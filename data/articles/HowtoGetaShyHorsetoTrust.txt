When you are confident, try rubbing and stroking the horse gently on the cheeks, legs, and hindquarters., Horses are curious creatures. It may be worth sitting on a fence, or in the corner of the stable reading out loud or just talking to them; let the horse come to you. If you go to them, this ruins the whole point of the exercise. An animal that feels in control and responding to its own interest is less likely to feel flighty.

Let the horse nudge and sniff you before reaching out to pet it.
 When out riding, try the simple step of murmuring or talking in a low voice to the horse. Tell your horse about your day! This close communication can help a bond to form and the horse will grow attached to your voice and learn to trust it., Trust is an element of time. Never assume that the horse will trust you after a few days. Congratulate your horse both verbally with talking, and physically with petting. Realize that trust needs to worked on continuously., Horses feel your emotions in the way you ride. You must seem relaxed but alert... practice that stance and work on your confidence.

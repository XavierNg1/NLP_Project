 Use a metal or rubber fine-toothed comb to remove dead hair, dirt, and oil from a shorthaired cat's coat. When brushing your cat, remember to brush in the direction of its hair growth. Also make sure to brush your cat’s whole body, from head to tail, including its abdomen and chest., Use long-toothed slicker brushes and combs to brush longhaired cats. Starting with your cat’s abdomen and legs, gently comb its fur upward toward its head. Also comb your cat’s neck fur upward toward its chin. However, comb the hair on the top side of the coat in the direction of the hair growth.In order to brush the tail, part the hair down the middle and carefully brush out the fur on both sides.
 When combing your cat, make sure to check areas where mats commonly occur. These areas are around the groin and abdomen, behind the ears, between the back legs, behind the front legs (its armpits), around the collar area, and along the back of the haunches.

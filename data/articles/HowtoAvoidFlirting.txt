 Don’t talk about personal or home problems. Confiding is something that occurs between close friends.;
, He/She pokes you, don’t poke him/her back. Ignore them and talk about something generic.
 Concentrate on something else while you talk to him or her, and if you do look at the person, don't hold the gaze, but don't look nervous or scared either. Look almost bored, but don’t be rude.
 If a friend senses your discomfort, they'll often intervene.
 Politely tell them that you have somewhere else to get to or someone else you need to talk to.
 Make sure this is naturally woven into the conversation, as this tactic can be very insulting if not done carefully.
 Have your arms folded and lean away from the person.

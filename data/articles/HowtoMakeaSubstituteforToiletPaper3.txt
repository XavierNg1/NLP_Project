 Stick a travel-size pack of tissues in your purse or luggage. This is the next closest thing to toilet paper.
 You know that cardboard tube that's still hanging up on the roll when all the toilet paper is gone? Start peeling the layers of paper off it until you have enough to wipe with. Wet it at the sink to make it soft and comfortable. Flush when done.
 Although popular among the Romans, this method is no longer considered a great idea. Sponges pick up filth and bacteria quickly, so you'd better know where the sponge has been. After you're done, submerge the sponge in diluted bleach, any product containing quaternary ammonium, or boiling water. Take it out after five minutes.

 If your school has a specific dress code, it’s best to adhere to it as much as possible. It’s understandable that you want to flex your individuality muscles but school may not be the best place if there are rules clearly established. If your school requires you wear a uniform, you may not have much wiggle room, but if they only have a few restrictions, follow those, but still add a personal touch.


Determine what they are and figure out a way to work within those guidelines. If there is something you’re just dying to wear to school, consider asking an adult like your parents or a faculty member to double check.
You can still be yourself while following the dress code by wearing unique accessories like hair adornments, watches or cool footwear.
 What might be okay to wear with your friends at the skate park, may not be the best choice for church or to meet a college recruiter. Consider all your options when choosing an outfit to ensure you send the proper image.


Skip the suit and tie if that isn't your thing. Just make sure it's classy.
 This is especially true for young ladies. There’s no need to toss on a belly-bearing top and a short skirt, even if it is scorching hot out. It probably is the most comfy thing you own, but leave a little to the imagination. A good rule of thumb is if you’re showing skin on top, cover the legs or vice versa.


You should definitely showcase your sense of style and personality, but ask yourself what type of message you will be sending.
Remember, you want to be perceived as a proper young woman and nothing else.
 You’re hilarious and everyone knows it, but a proper young guy will not want to wear an offensive t-shirt, if trying to send the right message. Think about all the eyes that will be on you as soon as you step outside. They may not get the joke and think that you’re just a jerk instead.

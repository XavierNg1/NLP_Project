 For finding collections of free music, you may get better results searching for more general terms, like "free music downloads" or "music archive" rather than specific songs or artists. Searching by musical genre may get you closer to what you are looking for, but many sites offer multiple genres of music.


Some well-known examples of sites that offer free music for download legally include Jamendo, Free Music Archive, or NoiseTrade.
Many reliable websites like Amazon will offer some music for free as well.
Sites like Soundcloud and Bandcamp allow independent music producers to sell their music creations - or offer it for free.
If you are using a smartphone to search, some sites like Bandcamp or Soundcloud also offer their own apps that can be acquired from the App Store.
 Some sites, like Jamendo or NoiseTrade will group their music listings by genre. Most will have a search function where you can search for more specific terms like artist, song, or album.
 Most sites will have an integrated music player so that you can stream and listen to songs before you download them.
 Pages with free music will display links to download songs, or sometimes full albums.


You will need to select a save location when downloading a file. Keeping this location consistent will help you keep your music collection organized and easy to locate.
When downloading a full album, they may come in a compressed file format (.zip, .rar). You will need to extract the songs from the compressed file before you can put them on your mp3 player. To do this you can right-click and select “Extract” on Windows, or double-click the compressed file on Mac.

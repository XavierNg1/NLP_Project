 This method also requires that you line your baking sheet with a piece of wax paper or parchment paper. The lined baking sheet will serve as your surface for laying out and freezing your bacon slices., You donâ€™t need to leave a lot of space between each slice, but be sure the sides of your bacon are not touching., If have more bacon than fits on your baking sheet, you can add another sheet of wax paper on top of your first layer of bacon. Then you can finish spreading out your bacon on top of that second sheet of wax paper., Place your baking sheet in the freezer.Wait until the bacon is frozen solid.
 Once your bacon is frozen on your baking sheet, pull off the slices of bacon from your wax paper, place them in an airtight container or freezer bag, and put them back in the freezer immediately.

 Don't turn your room or home into a Troll museum. Rotate your collection and even change it up with the seasons or your mood. Let one or two Trolls speak for the entire collection. When someone asks for you to show them the rest you can show them., This really is only a deep box within a frame with a glass covering you can hang on a wall or set on a shelf

In a shadow box you can get really creative by adding a background and a fairy environment with small artificial plants and cute animal figurines. A spooky background can really set off a Wizard troll to great advantage.
 If you find one in it's original box, keep it in that original box or take the Troll out and keep the package in safe place. The original packaging will raise the retail value of the Troll inside and collectors go nuts over the original box.

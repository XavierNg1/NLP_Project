 In many jurisdictions, collecting or keeping wildlife is restricted or even forbidden. Check laws online or ask a local authority or bureau responsible for wildlife for details.,, (for example, subspecies, species, etc).

If you cannot identify a species, morphospecies, give it a descriptive name and use that name consistently.


Mating, spawning, and flowering seasons are the best times to collect.
 Does age matter? Are you only collecting adults? Or will juveniles be included?

How big or small are your specimens? Are they the size of a grain of sand? Or are they as large as a tree?
If they’re small, devise ways to extract them. For example, use very fine filters to rinse away debris, or use Salt and Hollick’s benzene flotation method where insects accumulate at the benzene-water interface and plant matter stays in the water, etc.
If they’re large, collect clippings of a sort; for example, hair, toenails, leaves, etc.
 If your specimens are animals, what do they like to eat or to be near?, In which case, identify each specimen alphabetically, numerically or alphanumerically.

 Place them in an inconspicuous spot, such as the back of a cupboard, under your bed, or in a drawer. Be sure that the location is easily accessible for you. Make sure that no one sees you taking out your supplies or hiding them. It may be wise to switch your hiding spots once in a while.
 Whether you share a room, closet, or cabinet with a younger sibling, you may want to store your period supplies on the highest shelf that you can still reach. If the supplies are out of their eyesight, they won't know that they are there, and won't go snooping around.
 Tell them that you are not comfortable with them prying through your private belongings. If your family members respect you, and they come across your box, they won't go through it.

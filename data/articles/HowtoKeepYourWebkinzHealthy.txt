 Doing dailies on Webkinz World will boost up your Webkinz's Happiness Bar. Here is a list of Dailies you should do on Webkinz World: Bathroom, Arcade, Kinzstyle Outlet (so you can buy the clothing on PJ Collie's desk), Curio Shop (so you can go gem hunting), Kinzville Academy, Employment Office, Webkinz Stadium (optional), Daily Activities, and Alysa's Star Challenge.;
, Play the Game of the Day if you like that game and compete in the Tournament Arena. That boosts the Webkinz's Happiness, too.
 Buying healthy foods for your Webkinz can boost up their HHH (Happiness, Healthiness, and Hungriness Bars). Buying the food made for your Webkinz will boost up their HHH, too. To find the food made for your Webkinz look in the W Shop and it will tell you.
 Doing this will pause where their HHH Bars are at. EGG, if your Webkinz is at 100 percent at all the HHH then when you put your Webkinz to bed and log out when you log in it will still be at 100 percent at all the HHH.

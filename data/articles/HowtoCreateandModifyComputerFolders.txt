 You usually create personal folders in one of a few places, such as your desktop, or inside existing default folders called "My Documents" or "Documents". As your first step, find one of those default folders.


Use the Search feature if you don't know where the folder is. You will need to know in the future.;
, (There are different ways for you to create folders, but they have the same basic result.)


Computers upgrade, or you may use different computers, but you can always use the Help feature. If you want options on how to create a new folder, open the computer “Help” or “Help and Support”, and type “new folder” in the search box.



It’s easy to temporarily misplace folders. If that happened here, open Search and look for “mytest”.
 To see folder properties on Windows right-click the folder and select “Properties”. On Macintosh, click once on the folder, then from the top menu select "File > Get Info". You've got the basics! Close the properties pop-up window.

 Convert mixed numbers into improper fractions by multiplying the integer by the denominator and adding the numerator to the product. Convert integers into improper fractions by placing the integer over a denominator of “1.”


Example: 8 + 2 1/4 + 2/3
8 = 8/1
2 1/4; 2 * 4 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9; 9/4

Rewritten equation: 8/1 + 9/4 + 2/3

, Implement any of the methods used for finding the LCD of common fractions, as explained in the previous method sections. Note that for this example, we will be using the “listing multiples” method, in which a list of multiples is created for each denominator and the LCD is identified from these lists.


Note that you do not need to create a list of multiples for 1 since any number multiplied by 1 equals itself; in other words, every number is a multiple of 1.
Example: 4 * 1 = 4; 4 * 2 = 8; 4 * 3 = 12; 4 * 4 = 16; etc.
3 * 1 = 3; 3 * 2 = 6; 3 * 3 = 9; 3 * 4 = 12; etc.
The LCD = 12


, Instead of multiplying the denominator alone, you must multiply the entire fraction by the digit required for changing the original denominator into the LCD.


Example: (12/12) * (8/1) = 96/12; (3/3) * (9/4) = 27/12; (4/4) * (2/3) = 8/12
96/12 + 27/12 + 8/12

, With the LCD determined and the original equation changed to reflect the LCD, you should be able to add and subtract without difficulty. Remember to simplify the fraction at the end, if possible.


Example: 96/12 + 27/12 + 8/12 = 131/12 = 10 11/12

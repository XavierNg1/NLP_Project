 While not quite a break-up, taking a break can be a big step, and you should know why you are doing it. Maybe things aren't moving as well as you would like, or perhaps your relationship has gotten stale., If you think the relationship is important and could still work, make sure your boyfriend knows that. You should want him to think about the relationship too.Make sure you clearly let him know how this time will help make your relationship stronger, and that you still care about him., Before you just leave, let him know how long you're thinking this may be. It doesn't have to be an exact time, something vague like a few weeks. You'll want to set some time so that he isn't pestering you to get back before you've both had the space, and so that you have a chance to work through issues., A phone call every few days can be good to keep in touch, but that is up to you. Avoid other communication. That will just make it harder to get the space you are looking for., If you are comfortable with him seeing other people, that's fine. Remember, though, that you are still responsible for what you do while on a break., Your break needs to be about making sure the relationship is right for you. Ask if you are considering your needs, or if the relationship is truly fulfilling., While there isn't any conclusive information, taking a break in your relationship can be a precursor for ending it. You may find you don't miss him at all, and that your life is better without him. If that ends up being the case, make contact with him and end the relationship. Taking a break is not the same thing as breaking up, and you both deserve that kind of closure.Be prepared for the possibility that he will come to that conclusion as well. Taking a break is a risk, but it may be a worthwhile one if your relationship has grown stale or stagnant.

 If you have mascara wands that did not come with the mascara container, avoid using wands bigger than the tube. If you struggle to force the wand into the tube, air will get pushed into the tube. Too much exposure to air causes mascara to dry out and clump., Many people pump the wand to get more mascara on the brush. This pushes more air into the container, causing mascara to dry out faster. Stick to one motion to remove mascara to make it last longer.If you're continuously not getting enough mascara on the brush, and you've had the same tube for awhile, it may be time to get new mascara.
 No matter how well you care for it, mascara will dry out over time. If none of the above methods restore your mascara, you should invest in a fresh tube. Mascara usually lasts around two to three months.

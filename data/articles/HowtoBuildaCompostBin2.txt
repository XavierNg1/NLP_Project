 This will form the body of your compost bin, which will be a cylinder shape. This bin will be able to compost things like yard waste, sawdust, and leaves. It can only be used outdoors over soil and will compost very slowly.









The height of the rectangle will be the height of your bin.
The length of the rectangle will be the diameter of your bin.
If you’re not sure where to begin, hold the uncut chicken wire in front of you to get a sense of how tall and wide you’d like it to be. Since you’ll be filling this bin with yard waste, err on the large side.
 These will be staked into the ground to maintain the shape of your wire bin, so be sure that they are longer than the height of your chicken wire.
 Stretching it out will make it easier to work with.
 This works best of you place the stake beneath the wire. The top of the stake should stick out slightly above the top of the wire.
 Your chicken wire should now be in the shape of a cylinder.
 It may be necessary to crawl inside the wire to reach the stake better.
 Make sure you choose a spot that won’t get in your way later.
 Be sure to stake them close enough to the wire that they don’t pull it out of shape. When you are done, the four stakes should be in the shape of a square.
 Once the bin is fully secured, you can start filling it with yard waste.

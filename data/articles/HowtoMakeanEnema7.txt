 Bring 1 qt (1 L) of distilled water to a boil in a kettle or small saucepan.
 Place three bags of chamomile or green tea in a non-aluminum bowl and pour the boiling water over the bags. Allow the tea to brew for 5 to 10 minutes.


Note that you may opt to use 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of loose leaf tea instead of the three bags.
Chamomile tea can brew for 5 to 10 minutes, but green tea should only brew for 5 minutes.
Chamomile tea helps to soothe and cleanse the colon. It can also cleanse the liver. Chamomile-based enemas are commonly used to treat hemorrhoids.
Green tea has helpful antioxidants that can improve the health of your colon. An enema made with green tea is typically used to help replenish beneficial bacteria in your digestive tract.
 Once the tea has steeped for an appropriate amount of time, remove the tea bags.


If using loose leaf tea, strain the tea through a fine-mesh strainer. Discard the leaves and retain only the liquid tea. Only use the liquid portion for the enema.
 If necessary, add enough distilled water to the tea to bring the volume back up to 1 qt (1 L).


The water you add should be fairly warm.
Before application, the tea enema should reach a temperature between 98 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit (37 and 40 degrees Celsius).
 Administer the enema using standard methods. Retain it for up to 20 minutes before evacuation.


To obtain any benefit, you should try to retain the enema for at least 10 minutes.

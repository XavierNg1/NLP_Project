 All outfits at country concerts stem from one of these two looks.


Denim is a key component to any country outfit. Jeans can come in different styles and colors. Jean skirts, boyfriend jeans, jean shorts, and jean jackets are all perfect for a country concert.
They have a casual look but can still be tweaked to look feminine.
Lighter colored jeans work best for day concerts but dark tones work best for nighttime.
 Floral prints, flowing fabrics, and ruffly cuts are all feminine choices.


"Sexy" isn't the style at country concerts.
Summer dresses, day dress and maxi dresses are all fashionable decisions. Country concerts tend to be more casual than pop concerts.
Your dress should be more conservative. Miniskirts really aren't practical or comfortable. , Remember, country style is more geared towards a casual look. Flannel is always in style at a country concert. Looser button ups, camisoles, and tank tops are all great options.
Ruffles, lace and bows are all details that work for this type of concert.
Wear a denim jacket over a t-shirt or camisole. Denim is very fashionable in a country look , Country looks emphasize cowboy hats and boots. Add a cowboy hat for a playful look.
Cowboy boots, or boots in general, are always a popular option.
Jewelry should be delicate like studs, charm bracelets, and long natural looking necklaces.
Emphasize both comfort and femininity.
 Don't wear too much makeup or overdo your hair. A natural look is most fashionable for a country concert. Wear your hair down in loose curls, up in a messy bun or in a single braid.
For make-up it's important to be natural and minimal. A pink, glowing blush is a must.
Don't wear bright eyeshadow or lipstick. Harsh, bright colors don't really go with the casual vibe of country fashion.

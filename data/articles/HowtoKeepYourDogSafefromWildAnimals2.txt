 Avoid letting your dog off its leash unless you’ve taken it to a dog park or other safe, fenced area. Never assume that your dog will listen to vocal commands when off its leash. Remember that the lease is an important means of training your dog and maintaining your status as alpha., When you walk your dog, always keep an eye on whatever it’s sniffing or trying to investigate. Do your best to keep it out of holes or enclosures that resemble burrows or dens of any kind. In addition to preventing a chance encounter with a venomous snake, you’ll keep your dog from attacking a rodent or other small animals.Attacking a small animal presents the risk of disease and will disrupt your dog’s obedience training.
 If you live in a wooded location, or are aware of coyotes, foxes, or other potentially dangerous wild animals in your area, prepare yourself for an encounter ahead of time. You can bang a walking stick on the ground or throw it in the direction of the animal to scare it off.Noisemakers like whistles, air horns, and bells are also useful for scaring away potentially dangerous animals.Hold your large dog’s leash tightly or pick up your small dog if you see a wild animal.
Remember, never turn your back on a coyote, fox, wolf, or other wild animal. Turning your back will encourage them to chase.

 If you continuously attend boring classes with a negative mindset, you waste energy, you probably won’t make friends, and you won’t learn much, so it’s important to recognize unrewarding thoughts and to avoid them. Thinking about how much you hate the class is unproductive. It will just put you in a bad mood, which might last the rest of the day.
If you emit a crabby aura, other students probably won’t want to work with you on group projects. One of the greatest benefits of attending any class is meeting new people, so don’t lose out on that!
You will not absorb the information. If you choose not to read or do other assignments and/or text during lessons instead of listening, taking notes, and participating, you won’t retain the course content.
 Gather up your strength and turn those negative thoughts into positive ones! It will be harder to counter negative thinking on some days, but just try so that the humdrum class will become more tolerable. Remind yourself that the class only meets a few hours per week.
Remember that not everyone in this world has the opportunity to learn. Obtaining an education is a privilege. Realize that gaining knowledge is a good use of time.
 There are so many reasons to be a positive thinker. Being more upbeat will make class better and it will improve your life in general. When you limit pessimistic thinking, you will feel better mentally and emotionally.
Your grade in the class or at least the understanding of the content will improve.
Your stress level will lessen.
Overall, you will probably become a more likeable person, in or out of class.

 If you've recently sent a Snap to a person, you can check to see if they've opened it, which can be a good indicator as to whether they've been online.
 Doing so reveals the Chat screen.
 It's located just underneath the recipient's username.


If the user has opened the Snap, it will read as Opened.

If the user hasn't opened it yet, it will read as Delivered.

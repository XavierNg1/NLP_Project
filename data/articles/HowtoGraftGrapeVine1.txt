Scion wood refers to smaller, younger shoot systems that you graft onto older vines. In contrast, the stock or rootstock is the mature vine growing in the ground that the scion is grafted onto.
Wait until well after a major freeze occurs. Doing so reduces the risk of accidentally damaging the fresh shoots.
 You should only take scion wood from healthy, established vines that show no sign of disease, injury, or other stress.


For best results, you should also look for canes that have received plenty of sunlight. Avoid canes that grew primarily in shade.
 The canes you cut for use as scion wood can range in length from 4 inches (10 cm) to 2 feet (0.61Â m) (61 cm). Each cane of scion wood should have at least two buds, if not more.


For longer scion wood, make sure that the canes you cut have buds in multiples of two (two, four, six, eight, etc.).
Select round canes that are 5/16 inches (7.9 mm) to 9/16 inches (14.3 mm) in diameter.
Use a sharp blade to make a flat cut on the bottom of the cane and an angled cut on the top of the cane. Make sure that there is excess stem extending beyond the buds on either end, too.
 Wrap the scion wood in moist newspaper and place the bundles in a plastic bag. Seal the bags and keep them in a cellar or similar area that consistently remains at temperatures just above freezing.


It's best to bundle scion wood in groups of 100, but smaller groups can work if necessary.
Ideal temperatures range between 34 and 36 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 and 2.2 degrees Celsius).
Remove the scion wood from storage a full day before you intend to graft the vines. Allow them to sit out and gradually reach the current outdoor temperature.

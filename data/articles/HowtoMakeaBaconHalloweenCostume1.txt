 Keep in mind that you'll need to cook the bacon before creating your costume and given that bacon shrinks after cooking, you'll want to purchase more bacon, not less.


Purchase approximately 1 lb. (450mg) of bacon per appendage; you'll need more if you're taller than average.
Keep the bacon refrigerated until you plan to cook it.
Opt for pork bacon rather than turkey bacon. Pork bacon will curl and plump up better than turkey, which provides you with a more interesting design.;
, Instead of slapping cooked pork directly onto your body, create your costume using flesh colored pants, a t-shirt, shorts or a dress.


Purchase your clothing from an inexpensive retailer. You will be attaching real bacon to the outfit and probably will not want to wear it after Halloween.
Buy an outfit made of a breathable fabric. Materials like cotton will help to soak up any residual bacon grease and keep you clean during the festivities.
Pick up clothing that is appropriate for the occasion – if it’s going to be cold, wear long sleeve shirts and pants or even thermals underneath. You certainly won’t want to cover this outfit with a coat!

, The best way to affix pieces of bacon to your flesh colored clothing will be to jab the safety pin through the top of each cooked piece of bacon and then pin it to your clothing.


The brown duct tape can be used to secure the bacon to your clothes if the safety pin does not hold it properly.



Use a frying pan that can accommodate approximately 5 to 10 pieces of bacon at a time.
Cook the bacon over medium to low heat to avoid burning.



Allow the bacon to cool on paper towels for approximately 15 to 20 minutes.
Pat each piece of bacon with a paper towel to remove excess grease.



Lay the clothes on your kitchen table or a large countertop.
If the clothing is wrinkled, use an iron to remove creases before proceeding.

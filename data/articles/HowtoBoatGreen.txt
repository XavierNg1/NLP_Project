 Keep your engine well tuned to prevent fuel and oil leaks. Place an oil absorbent pad in your bilge and under your engine where drips may occur. Check the pads often; don’t let them clog the bilge pump, and dispose of them as hazardous waste at a marina or local hazardous waste collection center.;
, Wrap a plastic bag or absorbent pad around the oil filter to stop oil from spilling into the bilge.
 Don’t "top off" or overflow your fuel tank. Leave the tank ten percent empty to allow fuel to expand as it warms.
 Never use soap to disperse fuel and oil spills. It’s illegal and it increases harm to the environment.
 If you must work on the water, minimize your impact by containing waste. Use tarps and vacuum sanders to collect all drips and debris for proper disposal.
 Use non-abrasive underwater hull cleaning techniques to prevent excessive paint discharge. Remember, dry storage reduces the need for antifouling paints and saves money.
 This includes paints, batteries, antifreeze, cleaning products, oil and oil filters.
 Manage sewage wastes properly. Never discharge sewage within 3 miles (4.8 km) of shore. Use harbor pump-out stations and shore-side facilities. If you don’t have an installed toilet, use a port-a-potty and empty it at a harbor dump station or bathroom.
 Never throw cigarette butts, fishing line, or any other garbage into the ocean. Recycle plastic, glass, metal, and paper at shore-side facilities.
 Do dishes and showers on shore whenever possible. (Grey water is the soapy water used in boat maintenance.)

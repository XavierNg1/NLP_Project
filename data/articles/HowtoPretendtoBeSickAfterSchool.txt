 Say your day was fine up to midday.;
, About five minutes after you've been picked up, wrap your arms around your stomach and say you have a little bit of a stomachache.
 Every minute or so, just make a small "ugh/appropriate distress" sound.
 Say you need a rest before attending the activity you participate in.
 Remember: when you're sick, you don't show off your sickness; you only emit signals showing sickness. Whenever contacted, look sad or grumpy as if something isn't right, and remain quiet. However, don't be a mime - just speak very little and speak softly.
 Clutch your stomach and look like you're in pain.
 If your parent or guardian asks if you're okay, make them aware that you aren't feeling too good, but "reassure" them that you will be fine for practice; but make it clear that if you get any worse, skipping the session will have to be an option.


Don't exaggerate how much you want to go to this activity. This can make your parents believe that you love the activity, and sign you up for more of it when that's not what you wanted!

, Bring on the drowsiness, headaches and whatever else you are prone to getting, illness-wise. If you fail, prolong your act through practice.
 This will create bags under your eyes, which will help convince your parents that you got worse as the night went on. If they suggest or try to give you medicine, go to the kitchen and get a glass of water. Don't take the pill - quietly throw it away. Go back to your parents with the glass and pretend to put the pill into your mouth and take a sip of water and gulp the rest down. This will hopefully convince them you took the pill.
 Eliminate one symptom of your sickness at a time so they won't take you to the doctor the next day, and to avoid getting in trouble for faking.

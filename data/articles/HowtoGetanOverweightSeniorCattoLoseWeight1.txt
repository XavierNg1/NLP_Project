 If you are concerned that your senior cat is heading towards obesity, speak to your veterinarian before altering its diet. Weight gain (as well as other warning signs of obesity, such as loss of energy and difficulty breathing) are common with aging cats, but a vet should rule out other possible causes. Diseases that may cause weight gain in cats include:Hypothyroidism
Insulinoma (a tumor in the pancreas)
Hypothalamic abnormalities
Problems with the pituitary gland (which regulates hormone production);
, To encourage weight loss in your senior cat, reinforce distinct mealtimes to prevent overeating. Leaving food out for your cat to eat whenever it wishes will make it more difficult to monitor how much it is eating, and when. Place your cat’s food in its bowl and leave it out for about twenty minutes, then remove it until the next mealtime.Your cat should be eating no more than one cup of dry cat food per day, or 6 oz. of canned food., To help your senior cat lose weight, replace its dry cat food with canned food. Canned food generally has more protein (which should form the bulk of your cat’s diet) and fewer carbohydrates than dry food, so it is more conducive to weight loss. Dry food also contains more additives and preservatives, which are unhealthy and should be avoided as much as possible.Canned food also has a higher moisture content, which is beneficial for senior cats who are prone to dehydration.
Opt for organic canned food, which will have healthy, natural ingredients and no preservatives.
 A cat’s diet be made up of less than 10% treats each day. Be especially mindful with your senior cat, keeping treats down to 2 or 3 per day and rewarding your cat with petting and praise instead. Make sure that all household members adhere to this rule, and keep track of the treats you give your cat in a journal or on a whiteboard that can be erased daily.

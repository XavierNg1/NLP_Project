 Line an oven-proof dish with aluminum foil.


The dish should be about twice as large are the squash itself since you will need to fit two halves in it. If you do not have a large enough dish for the entire squash, you can use two smaller dishes, instead.
 Use a heavy serrated knife to cut the squash in half from top to bottom.


The skin will be fairly thick, so you will need to use a sawing motion to split the squash in half.
 Dig the seeds and stringy pulp out with a sturdy metal spoon or ice cream scoop.


Discard the seeds.
 Pour your olive oil over the cut sides of both halves. Use your fingers to rub the oil evenly over the surface of the exposed flesh.
 Evenly sprinkle the salt and pepper over both sides of the squash.


Use about 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) pepper. You can use more if you prefer a stronger flavor, though.
 Place the squash cut-side-down in your prepared baking dish. Bake until done.


The squash is done once the flesh becomes tender enough to scrape into spaghetti-like strings.
 Use two forks to shred the flesh of the cooked squash into "spaghetti." Transfer to serving platters and enjoy hot.


Scrape out as much of the flesh as possible, leaving skin fairly hollowed out.

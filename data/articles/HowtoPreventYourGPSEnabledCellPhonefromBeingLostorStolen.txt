 Are you someone who likes to have their cell phone handy at all times? Keeping it in your pocket or purse is fine, but if you sit down at a table or in a bar, setting your phone down on the table can set you up to forget it later, like the guy who forgot his iPhone 4S. Keep your phone on your person at all times. If you’re someone who doesn’t need it with you all the time, you might want to consider leaving it in the car if you’re going into a bar or sporting event, or other place where it could be easily lost or stolen. If you do leave it in the car, be sure to keep it somewhere out of sight, like in the glove compartment. If a thief sees a $500 smartphone sitting in plain view, you might end up losing a cell phone and having to pay for a broken window!;
, In the event that your phone is stolen, having your serial number can be a big help. With it, you might be able to call the manufacturer and report the phone as stolen, so if someone sends it in for repairs, it can be returned to you! For example, if someone steals your iPhone and you have the serial number, you can report it to Apple. Then, if the thief brings the phone in for repairs at an Apple Store, they will know it’s yours!

, There are a number of apps you can download that allow you to track your GPS-enabled cell phone, lock it remotely, remotely erase your private data, and so on.


If you are an iPhone user, Apple's Find My iPhone can do all of these things. Find My iPhone also works for iPad and iPod Touch when connected to WiFi.

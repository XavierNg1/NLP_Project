 Certain words are associated with beautiful things; including something (or someone) lovely in your business's name will immediately put an image of beauty in a customer's mind. Here are some examples:

You could include "Audrey" in the name of your business as a reference to Audrey Hepburn, or "Marilyn" as a reference to Marilyn Monroe. The name of a beautiful and well-known person could be part of your company name. Ancient goddesses and legendary beauties, such as Helen of Troy, could also lend you inspiration.
Roses, lilies, lilacs, begonias - flowers are some of nature's most lovely creations. You could name your business after a flower.
Gemstones, such as sapphires, emeralds, and pearls, are also beautiful. They're especially good if you want to make your company sound cool as well as beautiful.
Nature in general is a good place to look for beauty.;
, Some words sound lovely, even if their definition is something like "chair" or "small fish." The sound of them is appealing in and of itself. Here are some examples of beautiful linguistic sounds to help you choose a word or even invent your own.

B. The letter B followed by a vowel often creates a beautiful sound (look at the word beautiful itself). Examples: Bohemian, balalaika, bungalow.
L and R. Think of murmur, cerulean, lilt, and rococo.
Long vowels. Consider the words free, rhapsody, demure, and delight. Each has a long vowel sound.
 Many foreign languages have lovely-sounding words. Try the Romantic languages (French, Spanish, Italian), Japanese, or German, for instance. Look at a dictionary of your language of choice to get ideas. A translation of one of the inherently beautiful words above (roses, sapphires, etc.) could make your business's name doubly beautiful., Talk to friends, family, or people of your company's target market and ask them what they think. This could be a way to narrow down candidate names or confirm that your final choice is a solid one.

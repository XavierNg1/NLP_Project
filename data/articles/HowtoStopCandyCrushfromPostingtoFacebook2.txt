 Look for the Facebook app on your iPhone or iPad. It’s the one with the app icon with the Facebook logo. Tap on it to launch it.
 Tap on the “More” button at the bottom of the navigation for the iPhone and on the downward chevron icon at the upper-right corner for the iPad. Select “Settings” from the menu, and you will be brought to the Settings screen.
 From the Settings screen, scroll down until you see Apps. Tap on it. You will be brought to the “Apps and Websites” screen.
 From this screen, tap “Logged in with Facebook.” All the apps and websites integrated with your Facebook account will be listed. Scroll down the list and tap on “Candy Crush Saga.” You will be brought to the app’s settings.
 The first option on the screen is for “Visibility of app.” This setting controls who can see your activities on this app. Tap the text beside it to open all possible options. Select “Only Me” by tapping on it.


Whenever Candy Crush posts to your wall, only you will be able to see it.
 From the header toolbar, tap on your name. You will be brought to your Timeline.
 Any post from Candy Crush will do. Tap on the downward chevron on the upper-right corner of the post box.
 From the menu that will appear, tap on “Hide from Timeline.” A confirmation box will appear asking if you’re sure to hide all posts from Candy Crush Saga from your Timeline. Tap the “Hide” button.


The posts will now be hidden from your Timeline.

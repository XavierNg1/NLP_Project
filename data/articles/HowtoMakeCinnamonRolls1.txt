 Start the mixer slowly until the ingredients start to combine.


Mix the ingredients on low for 5 minutes until the dough becomes shiny in appearance. If the dough looks too wet, add about 2 tablespoons more of flour to the bowl and mix again.;
, Scrape the dough from the hook.
 Place your dough inside a bowl you have lightly floured and begin spreading it out with your palms, folding it back in on itself and spreading it out again. Add flour as needed.


Return the dough to the bowl.
Cover it and let it rise for about 1 hour or until it has doubled its size.
 While the dough is rising, place the brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter into a small mixing bowl. Mix with a spoon until combined, and set it aside.
, Once the dough has risen, remove the cover and punch the air out of the dough.


Sprinkle a flat, clean work surface with flour and place the dough on it. Sprinkle the dough with some flour.

Roll out the dough to a 1/2 cm (1/5 inch) thickness, making sure there is enough flour to prevent it from sticking to the table.



Carefully roll the dough into a log.
Cut the roll into slices of about 3 cm (1.18") in thickness.
 Cover again and allow them to rise for 15-20 minutes.
, Let the rolls bake for 12-15 minutes.



Your cinnamon rolls are now ready to serve! They can be eaten cold but they taste especially good warm. Try them both ways!

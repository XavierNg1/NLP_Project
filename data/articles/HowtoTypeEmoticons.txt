 "Western" emoticons rose from early chat services such as IRC and AOL, primarily in North American and European countries. They are typically written horizontally from left to right; the top of the "head" is almost always on the left side.


Western emoticons tend to focus more on the "whole face", and tend to have more literal translations that "Eastern" emoticons.
Western emoticons typically just use Latin letters and are often distinguishable by single characters.;
,: for the eyes (in most cases). Most Western emoticons rely on : to be the "eyes", though other characters can be substituted depending on the circumstances.
 Western emoticons are often expressible both with and without noses, which are shown with -. Whether or not you decide to include a nose is entirely up to your preference.
 The simplest emoticon is the Smiley :). From this base, there are hundreds of possible emoticons. You can add a hat (<]:)) or a beard (:)}), or anything else you can come up with. Below are some of the more common Western emoticons, though there are countless variations:

, Eastern emoticons originate from southeast Asia. they are typically written "front-facing", as opposed to the horizontal orientation of Western emoticons. Much more emphasis is put on the eyes, which are used to convey the emotion.


Many Eastern emoticons use non-Latin characters. This gives the writer a much larger range of designs that can be created, but some computers may not be able to properly display all of the characters.
 Many Eastern emoticons are surrounded by ( ) to denote the outline of the head or body. It's up to you whether or not you want to include it. Some emoticons work better with or without it.
 Both Windows and OS X have a Character Map (Character Viewer in OS X) that allows you to browse through all of the fonts on your system to find specific characters. Use this to find characters to create your emoticons with, but remember that the other person won't be able to see it unless they have that same font installed.



Windows - Press ⊞ Win+R and type charmap to open the Character Map. Use the menu at the top to switch between your fonts. Search for and download a font called "Code2000" for access to nearly any Eastern symbol. Click here for instructions on installing fonts.

Mac - Click the Apple menu and select "System Preferences". Click "Keyboard", select the "Keyboard" tab, and then check the "Show Keyboard & Character Viewers in menu bar". Click the new icon that appears next to the clock, and select "Show Character Viewer". OS X comes with all of the fonts you need to make most Eastern emoticons.Emotion/Object

 Look at some pictures of this particular cut and familiarize yourself with the pattern. Start shaving the most important areas. Begin shaving the whole body at the hind end and work your way up to the front of the dog. Shave the chest and up under the dog and the belly.Make sure to shave down the legs all the way the hocks to the joint were the foot bends and then stop shaving. You need to leave this hair to shape later.
 Use a dog clipper with a ten blade to do this haircut with. To start this haircut, take the dog clipper with the ten blade and start at the back of the neck and shave down the back to the base of the tail. Move the clippers in a slow motion against the grain of the hair.If the hair seems too thick, you can use a comb and scissors to clip the hair shorter so you can go back over it with the clippers. Simply comb out the hair and use the scissors to cut the hair above the line of the comb.
Shave a one inch ring around the tail and leave a ball of hair at the end to shape later.
 To do the face, shave down the nose, go down the muzzle to the nose, and under the jaw. Next, go back up under the eye to the corner of the eye. From there, go straight to the outer ear and shave it clean.Make sure the lips are shaved clean. There should be no little stray hairs remaining.
Be very cautious when shaving your poodle’s face. Move the clippers very slowly and be careful not to touch them to your dog’s eyes or push too hard and irritate the sensitive skin on your dog’s face.
 Take the paw and hold it in your hand and shave it clean, including the under pad, until you clip up to the big joint on the foot. You can use scissors to get rid of most of the hair on the bottom of the paws if you are worried about using the clippers on them. By this time there will be four legs with shaggy hair on them so far and short, shaved hair on the body.Be careful not to nick the webbing between the toes as this is very delicate skin.

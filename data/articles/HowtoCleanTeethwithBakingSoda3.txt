 In a small bowl, add 2–3 tablespoon (29.6–44.4 ml) of baking soda. Add lemon juice a few drops at a time, stirring until the mixture forms into a paste. The baking soda will act to remove surface stains while the lemon juice will whiten teeth., Wipe saliva off of your teeth with a paper towel. Apply the paste generously to dry teeth with a toothbrush and let it sit. Make sure it covers all of your teeth, and avoid swallowing any of the mixture., Let the paste sit on your teeth for one minute, timing it with your phone or a stopwatch. Rinse your mouth immediately to prevent the acidity of the lemon juice from harming your tooth enamel. Be sure that the paste is entirely removed from your teeth., As a milder alternative, use water to make the paste instead of lemon juice. Mix the paste the same way, using the same quantities of baking soda and liquid. Leave the paste on for three minutes instead of one as the milder mixture will not be acidic enough to harm enamel.

 Your partner won't enjoy the date if it seems thoughtless or impersonal. Consider if he/she wants an involved active date or would rather do something passive, like watch a movie.


For example, if your date dislikes nature, don't plan a hike and a picnic. Or, if he/she works in a coffee shop, avoid planning a date at the coffee shop. Be aware of his/her preferences.
Think about what you already know about your partner. Try to remember what you two have talked about together. What does your partner enjoy doing? What does your partner like eating? What does your partner hate?;
, If you're planning on a walk through town, fine, but you should let your date know ahead of time so he/she comes prepared. If you don't want to give away the specifics of the date, just be sure to tell him/her about anything that could impact wardrobe decisions and comfort.


For example, if you're taking your date to the zoo during the winter, let your partner know so he/she can dress warmly.
 Sharing the planning of a first date is a fun way reduce the stress of planning, while getting to know each other a little better. You could decide the first half and your partner could determine the other, or you could decide where to go for a meal and your partner could plan an activity.


If the first date goes well, you could continue sharing planning for subsequent dates. Instead of splitting up planning for a single date, take turns planning entire dates.

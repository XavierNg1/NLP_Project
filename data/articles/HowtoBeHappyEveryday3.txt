 Self-care essentially means doing something in service of yourself. It can be giving yourself a break, physically, or taking a mental time-out. Self-care has proven to make people feel better, have less stress, and function at a more productive level.Take a few minutes for self-care each day. Take some time to take a relaxing bubble bath, or treat yourself to reading a chapter of a great book.
Check in with yourself. Ask, "Am I taking on too much? Do I need to take a break?" If the answer is yes, allow yourself to take a guilt-free timeout.
 Self-criticism is normal. When your brain is at rest (or stressed) you automatically start thinking about problems you need to solve or tasks you need to finish.

Take a moment each day to look at yourself in the mirror and say something positive. Try, "Smile today. You have a great smile, and it's contagious."
Make a list of your positive attributes. When you're feeling down, look at this list for a mood boost.

But adding more appreciation to your life it a key to happiness.Try choosing one big thing and one small thing to be thankful for each day. You could say, "I'm grateful that my children are healthy."

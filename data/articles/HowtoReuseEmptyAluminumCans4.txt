 The amount of tabs you need depends on how big the belt will be. Plan for about three tabs per inch (2.54 cm). A waist size of 25-30 inches (63.5-76.2 cm) amounts to about 110 tabs., Get nylon cord from the craft store, making sure itâ€™s long enough to double around your waist. In the center of the cord, tie a knot as big as a pop tab, leaving a loop on the outside end. This loop will be used to secure the belt during use.
 Work from the backs of the tabs. Thread one end of your cord through the top. Thread the other end through the bottom. Push the tab all the way back to the end of the cord.
 When you add the second tab over the first tab, the cords should be reversed. The bottom cord should go through the top hole and the top cord should go through the bottom hole. When you push the tab next to the first one, the cords should form an X., The third tab should be below the second one. String the top strand of cord through the top hole and the bottom strand through the bottom hole.
 The fourth tab should go on top of the last one and the cords should cross over again to form an X. The fifth tab should go under the fourth tab with straight cords again. Repeat this pattern until the belt is long enough.
 All you have to do now is tie the free ends of the cord together. Make a couple of knots to keep it secure. You can also run it through a button first. Trim off excess cord. To wear the belt, put this end through the loop made earlier.

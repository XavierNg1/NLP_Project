 Turn the sink on a gentle flow with cool water. Rinse each mushroom individually, gently rubbing off dirt with your fingers. Pat dry with a paper towel when you are finished., If you own a salad spinner, you can put the mushrooms inside the basket. Run or spray water over them until all of the dirt runs off. Put the top back on, and spin the basket until the mushrooms are dry., Crimini mushrooms, like all mushrooms, absorb water easily, and this can make them taste spongy or rubbery. To avoid this, do not soak crimini mushrooms when washing them. Use only enough water to remove the dirt from the surface.Soaking mushrooms is really only a good option for mushrooms collected in the wild, such as morels or chanterelles.The vast majority of crimini mushrooms are raised commercially, and do not require soaking.

 Take a medium or large carrot and use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin. Next, take a sharp knife and carefully slice the carrot into coins. Make sure that they coins are ¼-inch (½-cm) thick or less, or you may have trouble cutting the flowers.If you have a mandoline, you may find it easier to cut the carrot into coins with it.
 Find a small round cookie cutter that’s smaller in circumference than the carrot coins. Press it into the center of the carrot coin to create a perfectly round circle.If you don’t have a round cookie cutter that’s small enough to fit inside the coins that you’ve cut, you can use a small plastic cap from a bottle or other household item to cut out perfectly round coins.
While the round cookie cutter will give a symmetrical circle, you don’t necessarily have to use it. If you’re comfortable with the finished carrot flowers being slightly irregular, you can skip this step.
 When you’ve used the round cookie cutter on all of your carrot coins, use the edge of a diamond-shaped cookie cutter to cut out small “V” shapes around the entire edge of the coins. That will form the petals for the flowers.If you don’t have a diamond-shaped cookie cutter, you can cut out the “V” shapes using a sharp knife.

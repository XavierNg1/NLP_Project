 When she does this, step back a little and she will throw a lightning ball at you. Swing your sword and if you get the timing right, you'll hit it and it will go back to Zelda. You'll have to hit it back and forth a few times before she misses and the lightning ball will hit her. Also, sometimes you will see a big triangle around you. GET OUT OF IT. It will take away some health. She will also fly towards you trying to hit you with her sword. Either use your shield or jump out of the way. Repeat a few more times.;
, To avoid this attack, perform a back slice to roll out of it. Jumping sideways won't do anything. If you don't have this hidden skill yet, it would be a wise idea to go and find all the howling stones and get the hidden skills before you start this battle with Ganon. You'll need the back slice to defeat him at the very end anyway.
 This is your chance. Swing your sword horizontally while "L" targeting so that it will deflect the orb back at her. If she knocks it back at you, do the same until it hits her and she will be shocked by the power of it. Do this avoiding the other attacks until she's officially defeated.

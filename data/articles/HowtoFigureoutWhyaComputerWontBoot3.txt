, Ensure that you are using the right type of charger for your laptop.


Laptops typically require 16-20V chargers. A charger with a different voltage may not offer enough current to power your laptop.
 This helps you ascertain that the current charger is not causing the trouble.
 Make sure the laptop battery has some charge in it.


If it is running low on power, plug it in and power it up.
, Then restart it.
 Disconnect all external devices, including monitors, cameras and so on. This way, you can make sure that they are not preventing your laptop from booting properly.
 Ensure that your laptop screen display is functional. If your laptop’s power LED is working and you can hear the hard disk or fans whirring, but you cannot see an image on the screen, the actual problem could be with the display.


Sometimes, the screen’s inverter failure causes the problem with the display. If this is the case, you could get the inverter replaced.
Use an external monitor to test your laptop’s display. Plug-in your monitor, power up your laptop and immediately shut its lid. If this external monitor cannot connect to your device, then the issue goes beyond a damaged screen display.
 In case you are not very comfortable working with PCs; or if all the above-mentioned steps failed; take your system to a computer repair shop. Describe the issue as best as you can and let them handle the problem.

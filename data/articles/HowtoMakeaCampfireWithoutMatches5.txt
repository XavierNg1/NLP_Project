 Find some and set it up in the fire pit, in readiness for burning. Also have a pile of kindling and wood fuel ready to throw on the fire progressively, as the fire takes hold properly.
 Or, if you have some other carbon steel, that will work too.
 Hold this end right down near the tinder pile.
 Do not strike with the blade. Strike down in the direction of the tinder; that way, the sparks will go straight down into the tinder and, with any luck, catch.

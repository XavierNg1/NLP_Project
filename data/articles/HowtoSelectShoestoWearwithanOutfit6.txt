 Boots evoke images of colder weather and prevent airflow from reaching your foot, making them warmer.
 The heel of this boot makes it sexy and helps it to elongate your leg, while the boot style makes it appropriate for heavy fabrics.
 While they do not elongate your leg quite as well skinny-heeled boots, they do dress up an outfit.
 Knee-high boots work well because many women's legs are narrowest directly below the knee. Knee-high fashion boots also make an excellent choice for skirts and dresses.
 Switch to your fashionable boots when you're comfortably inside.

 Any petroleum jelly will do. A little bit of Vaseline goes a long way, so try not to use too much. Scoop a glob of Vaseline into a small bowl or the palm of your hand.
 Mix thoroughly. Powder helps to set foundation and concealer, which can be useful when you're working with something as oily and viscous as Vaseline.Try to use crushed-up pressed powder, as it is easier to mix and transport than loose powder. If you use loose powder, however, you might be able to get a bit more coverage out of your concealer.
 This do-it-yourself concealer will probably not be as effective as most commercial products, but it should hold you over in a pinch.

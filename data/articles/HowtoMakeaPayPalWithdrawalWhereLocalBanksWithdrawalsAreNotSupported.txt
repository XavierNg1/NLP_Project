 If you don’t have a PayPal account, visit www.PayPal.com and open a new account. Make sure it is a premium/individual account to avoid sending and withdrawal limits. You will need to verify your PayPal account in order for you to be able to withdraw money from PayPal.;
, Once you are sure that your PayPal account is set up and ready to send and receive cash, it is time to apply for the Payoneer pre-paid debit card. This will entitle you to receive free $25 once you transfer at least $100 from PayPal to Payoneer. Payoneer prepaid MasterCard® is a free debit card issued by Payoneer Inc, one of the top companies that facilitate online payroll processing for freelancers and online entrepreneurs. Once they review and approve your debit card application, they will send you the card on your post office address and give you a free Virtual US account that will be used to withdraw your PayPal payments.
 For you to be able to make PayPal to Payoneer withdrawals, you need to link the two accounts. To do this, login on your PayPal and add the U.S Virtual bank Account details that you received from Payoneer when your application was approved; you will add these details under the list of bank accounts. The details will include the name of the U.S bank, routing number and Account number. In case you have trouble adding the new bank details, call PayPal on +14029352050 and tell them that you want to add a Virtual U.S bank account to make withdrawals. They will be happy to assist you and will setup things for you.
 Once you receive your Payoneer prepaid debit card, go back to Payoneer’s website to activate your card. Just log in, enter the full card number and your desired PIN (the one you will be using to make ATM withdrawals). You will see a confirmation message that your card is now ready!

, Next, give your clients/employer the email address associated with your PayPal and request them to send money to your account. When the funds are loaded, proceed to step 5.
 To withdrawal your money from PayPal to Payoneer, just login on your PayPal account, click on the withdrawal tab at the top. You will be given an option to select the U.S bank account that you added on your PayPal to initiate the withdrawal. Enter and verify the amount you want to withdraw and click on submit. You will receive an email from PayPal that the transaction has been initiated. The amount will then be automatically loaded on your Payoneer debit card within 48hrs to 120hrs. The charges for PayPal to Payoneer withdrawal will be 1%. So, if you have $100 on your PayPal, you will get $99 on your Payoneer debit card.
 Finally, it is time to “eat” your hard-earned cash from PayPal. Just pick your Payoneer debit card and visit any ATM with a MasterCard® Logo. Insert the card on the ATM machine, choose a language, enter your PIN and cash out your PayPal balance in your local currency. Remember to collect the receipt if the ATM has the thermal printer.

 It'll look like one of those knotted friendship bracelets, but match each color to a letter and you'll be all set.

For example if A: Green, B: Yellow, and C: Pink if the answers were B, C, A, A, B then it would go yellow, pink, green, green, yellow.
This method works for multiple choice tests only.

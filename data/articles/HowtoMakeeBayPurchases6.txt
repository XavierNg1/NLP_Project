 eBay allows for you to enter your maximum bid, which eBay will use that bid as a proxy bid (Proxy bidding means that eBay will increase your bid as other eBay users bid on the item until your maximum bid is reached).
 Once you have entered your maximum bid click on 'Place Bid.'

, Before confirming check that the number you entered is correct, misplacing a decimal point could be a costly mistake. Once you click on 'Confirm Bid' you have entered into a binding agreement to purchase the item if you win the auction. After clicking ‘Confirm Bid’ you may receive notice that you have been outbid (this happens immediately through eBay’s proxy bidding), if this happens return to step 1 and recalculate your maximum bid.
 Through proxy bidding your bid may be dangerously close to the maximum bid you entered, if this is the case it is time to re-evaluate your maximum bid.
 eBay provides the option of receiving outbid notices through email or SMS. Watching the item during the final moments of bidding will ensure that you can be the high bidder and win the auction.

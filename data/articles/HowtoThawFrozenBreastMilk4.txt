 Milk can separate and form a layer of fat at the top. Gently shake the container to mix the two layers together again., If your baby prefers heated milk, place the sealed container in a bowl of warm water until it reaches your baby’s favorite temperature. Never, ever heat milk in a microwave, stovetop, or in boiling water. It can spoil the milk, and it can also scald your baby!, Before giving the milk to your baby, test its temperature by putting a few drops on your wrist. If it feels hot to you, it’s too hot for your baby! It should feel lukewarm.
 If the milk smells or tastes sour, throw it away. Always check for spoilage, especially if the milk has been at room temperature for more than an hour or in the refrigerator all day.

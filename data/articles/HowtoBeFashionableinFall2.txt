 Think heavy-knit cottons, wools, cashmere, and traditional flannel fabric, among others. Stay away from sheer, flimsy materials, especially as the weather gets cooler. Heavy materials will keep you warmer, and they also look more appropriate than light materials.
 Sweaters scream fall and winter. Lighter sweaters with standard or low necklines work especially well for fall, when the weather is chilly yet not quite frigid.
 Wear tank tops and camisoles underneath low-cut blouses and vests over long-sleeve t-shirts. Layers keep you warmer and give your style more versatility.
 Dress according to the temperature. During early fall, while the weather is still somewhat warm, stick with short sleeves or three-quarter-length sleeves. Move onto long sleeves once the weather gets chillier. Fall fashions include a broad range of sleeve lengths, so wear whatever makes sense on a day-to-day basis.
 Standard and low necklines may work during early autumn, but once the weather starts turning colder, branch into higher necklines. Think turtlenecks and cowl-necks.

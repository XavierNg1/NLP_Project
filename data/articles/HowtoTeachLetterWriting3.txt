 Remember a lot of classes you have sat through in your life, when the teacher for the entire team just spoke at you, and you walked out learning nothing? Take these experiences and all the available literature on the different learning styles, such as visual, auditory and kinetic and use them to change the method of delivery and activities you intend to use in this lesson.
 Academia has spent time on researching kinetic learning as a valid style of learning. This requires a student to physically perform the task being taught in order to form the best memory pathways to remember it. With this in mind, incorporate activities into your lesson that allow students to try writing a letter for themselves in different context. For example, they can try writing a letter to themselves in 10 years' time, or a mock letter to the editor of a newspaper. The exact nature of the activities is a personal choice, just as long as you include actual letter writing experiences.

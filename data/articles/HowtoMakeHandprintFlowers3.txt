 These flowers are a great idea for children to make on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Begin by tracing your or your child’s hand with a pencil on a piece of light pink paper. Cut it out and then repeat the process on a piece of light and dark brown paper. You should end up with three handprints., Using a pencil, draw a stem on a piece of green paper. Make the stem big enough so that it looks like it could support the size of the handprints. Draw a few leaves branching off of the stem. Cut it out when you are finished drawing., Use a glue stick or white Elmer’s glue on the back of the stem. Glue the stem to a piece of white paper. Then, glue each of the handprints at the very top of the stem. The handprints should slightly overlap each other. The order of the handprints doesn’t matter.

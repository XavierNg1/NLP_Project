To stretch your wrists, sit on the floor and place your palm flat on the ground at a 90-degree angle to your arms. Gently bend your elbows and feel the stretch through your inner wrist. Then cross your arms in front of you, putting your hands on the ground with your fingertips pointing towards each other.
To stretch your ankles, make several circles with your foot (moving from the ankle joint) clockwise and counterclockwise.

 You can move any bird feeders or baths further from the windows so they have to stop at the feeder or the bath first, rather than flying straight into the windows.Keep in mind moving bird feeders in your yard will not deter non-feeder birds, such as migrant thrushes or warblers, from flying into the glass.
 Break out the wind chimes and place them outside above your windows. Look for wind chimes that contain shiny objects and make noise when they are hit by the wind.You can also make a wind chime by hanging compact discs or long strips of shiny, reflective plastic in front of windows. Another option is to hang old aluminum pie plates in front of the windows to deter birds.
 For a more natural look, you can suspend tree branches in front of the windows. Tie the branches to string and dangle them a few inches in front of your window in rows. This will allow you to still have a view out your window and deter birds from flying into the windows.

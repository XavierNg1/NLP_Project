 The casting tag is etched into your motor when it is created, and is used to help find the right parts if you need a replacement. This code also packs a large amount of information in it that will help you get to know your engine better.


You may need to clean the engine with a rag and some degreaser if it is too dirty to see the letters.
This code is usually on the side of the engine, but you might not be able to see it when the engine is in a car with older models. Use a light to scan both sides of the engine to find it.Ex.C5AE-9425-B, This will be a letter. If the letter is a "B," it means that the engine was built in the 1950s. Each decade after that has its own succeeding letter; "C" designates the 1960s, "D" designates the 1970s, and so on. The digit after the letter is the actual year. So C9 would be 1969, E4 would be 1984, etc., This will be a letter, and it signifies the basic design of the vehicle as shown below. Of course, this code should match up with the car that it is in (ie. a Mercury could be coded E5M), but you may be dealing with standalone engines or redesigned cars."A" - Generic and full-size engine
"D" - Falcon
"E" - Truck
"F" - Foreign Trans-Am racing
"G" - 1961 to 1967 Comet/1968 to 1976 Montenegro
"H" - 1966 to 1982 Heavy truck
"J" - Industrial Ford
"L" - Lincoln
"M" - Mercury
"O" - 1967 to 1976 Ford Torino/all Ford Fairlane
"S" - Thunderbird
"T" - Truck
"W" - Cougar
"Y" - Meteor
"Z" - Mustang
"6" - Pantera

, E stands for "Engine," so this should always be the fourth digit you see when identifying Ford motors.
 These four numbers will always be between 6000 and 6898, which describes the part numbering of the generic engine assembly. Different parts of the motor will correspond to different four-digit numbers., If your engine is modeled after the original design, this letter will be A. If it is the third manufactured version of the engine, it will be a C, and so on. This digit can be up to three digits long. For example, AB would be the 28th version â€” 26 for A-Z, then two for A-B.

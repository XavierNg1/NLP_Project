 Just as when you’re writing a note to ask a company to stop sending correspondence, you want to take advantage of the envelopes that they include for you to send items back, so you don’t have to pay for postage.You may want to save multiple return envelopes from the same company or organization. The more that you send back to them, the more likely they are to notice.
 If a note asking a company to stop sending junk mail doesn’t get your name off their mailing list, you may want to make more of a statement. Stuffing the pre-paid envelope with items from around the house makes it weigh more, so the company has to pay more when you send it back to them, which will hopefully make them think twice about sending you junk mail. Stuffing the envelopes with paper items, such as napkins, newspaper or magazine clippings, a deck of cards, or confetti, is usually the easiest way to go.
Stuff the envelopes until they can’t hold any more material. If you’re worried that they won’t stay shut, you may want to reinforce the closure with tape.
 It’s best to drop them in a mailbox because they’ll be sorted by an automated system. A mail carrier or post office clerk might notice an extra thick envelope, and throw it away, so it may not actually get back to the company.

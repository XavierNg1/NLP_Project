 Tell God everything. Tell God if you aren't able to raise your children to have fear for Him. Let God know your problem. Thank Him for his award, which is having children. Pray for blessing and good health. Pray to Him to help you raise your children correctly. Let your children pray, too. Let them know that they can always pray if they are in trouble. Let them know that God is always listening to them and their problems. Let them know that God is helping them without them knowing.;
, Bring God into your conversations with your children often. Talk about increasing faith in Him. Talk about what He might do for you to make your life happy. Talk about people who lost everything, but kept their faith on Him, and got rewarded. Let them know that if they keep their faith, they will get rewarded too.
 Make sure that they are active in the body of Christ. When they are in Church, they will be sure that God is real, which will create in them the fear for Him.
 Make sure your children read the Bible alone. Help them understand what's written and what it means. Make them remember God's words and save them in their hearts forever. Let them know that the Bible will help them in life as many times as possible.
 Let them know that they can't live without Him. Make them sure that He's always there for them, even if they can't see Him. Make them develop the confidence that God is always helping them, even when it looks like He isn't.
 Be a good example. Children obey their parents often. Don't tell them something and go to do the opposite. If they make mistakes, don't fix it and not discipline them. Discipline with love.
 God loves everyone who knows that He is real and have the fear for him. He said : “The Lord your God is with you, He is mighty to save. He will take great delight in you, He will quiet you with his love, He will rejoice over you with singing." Zephaniah 3:17 . Make them trust Him and trust His love. Let them know that God can do the impossible.

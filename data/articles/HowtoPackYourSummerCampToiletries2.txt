 You may want to put two boxes after each item, one for before camp, and one for after camp. The following list might be of help to you:


Toothbrush, toothbrush case, toothpaste, mouthwash, floss
Hairbrush/comb
Deodorant
Razor and shaving cream (if needed)
Shampoo and conditioner
Face cleaner/wash
Band-Aids, insect repellent, sunscreen, after-sun lotion,


Add anything else you think you need and subtract things that aren't relevant to you.

 A good start might be special elections or proposition elections with simple choice items.;
, For example, if you want to look at a town mayor's race, look at where the polling sites are for this race. Gather this data from your local election office. Develop a point of contact at this office to make sure the right sorts of permission is granted.
 The math for this is very simple and easy to do. For example, let's say there are four voting districts in the mayor's race.


District A: 1000 voters
District B: 1200 voters
District C: 900 voters
District D: 900 voters

,,, Let's say 500.


Multiply the percentage by the number:
District A: 25% x 500 = 125 voters
District B: 30% x 500 = 150 voters
District C: 22% x 500 = 112 voters
District D: 22% x 500 = 112 voters

, This is a simple basic control for gender.


District A: = 125 voters 63 male and 63 females
District B: = 150 voters 75 males and 75 females
District C: = 112 voters 56 males and 56 females
District D: = 112 voters 56 males and 56 females

This is the sample for this race. In some small local elections, the number might be lower. In most cases, it is a good idea to sample at least 100 voters per 1000 until the 500 person sample is reached.




Prepare ballots for the race with separate color ballots for male and female voters to keep the sample controlled. The ballots can be very small, just large enough to reflect choice.
Create a data gathering team. In most cases, exit polls can be handled by a minimum of one person per site, but two is better.
Assign a leader per site and create a reporting method using text messaging or email or cell phones.
 (a) only talk to voters as they leave the polls. (b) place the ballots in a container. (c) Count the ballots in a discreet location, such as inside a car etc.
 Note, it is best to embargo results with media until the polls close.

Note: No method is perfect, this is a learning exercise.

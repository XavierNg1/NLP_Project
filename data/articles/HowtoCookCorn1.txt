 Meanwhile, prepare the corn cobs by removing the husks and silks.


The exact amount of water you need will vary depending on how large each ear of corn is. Make sure that you use enough water to completely cover the ears of corn once they are submerged.
Note that you can add up to 1 tsp (5 mL) salt to the water if desired, but it is not needed.
To remove the husks, snap off the stem of the corn with your hands. Pull the stem over the length of the corn to peel off the husks still attached to it. Remove the remaining husks by peeling them off with your fingers.
Rinse the husk-free corn cobs under running water. Rub your hands over the corn to loose and free as many of the silky threads you spot clinging to the corn.;
, Cover the pot and let it return to boiling.


Use tongs to dunk the corn into the water. Avoid using your hands to transfer the corn since doing so may result in burns.
If the boiling slows or stops after you place the corn in the stockpot, allow the water to reach a boiling point again before timing the cooking process.
 The corn should be "tender-crisp" when done.


"Tender-crisp" means that the corn is soft enough to press, but not mushy.
The precise amount of cooking time will vary based on the type of corn and how mature it is. Fresh corn and sweet corn usually cook fastest.
 Transfer the ears of corn to a layer of clean paper towels and let drain for 30 to 60 seconds before serving.


The corn will be hot, so you may want to wait a few minutes before biting into it.
Corn is usually served with a drizzle of butter.

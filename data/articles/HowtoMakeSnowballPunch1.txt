 Place 1 cup (225 g) of sugar and 1/2 cup (120 ml) of water in a small saucepan. Turn the heat on to medium-high and stir the mixture occasionally. The mixture should boil and turn syrupy.It's important to boil the water and sugar so that you don't have grainy punch.;
, Remove the pan of syrup from the heat and stir in 1/2 (7 ounces or 200 g) of a can of sweetened condensed milk and 1 1/2 teaspoons of almond extract. Ensure that the sweetened condensed milk is incorporated.The mixture will start to look snowy white after you add the sweetened condensed milk and almond extract.
You can use vanilla extract if you prefer the flavor of vanilla over almond.
 When you're ready to serve the white punch with snowballs, pour the mixture into a punch bowl or two and pour in 3 (2-liter) bottles of lemon-lime soda. Stir the punch gently so it combines.You can prepare the mixture ahead of time. Just refrigerate the punch mixture and add the soda right before you're ready to serve it.
 Get out a container of vanilla ice cream or frozen vanilla yogurt. Scoop at least 1/4 of the container into large scoops that resemble snowballs. Gently drop the ice cream snowballs into the punch bowl.If you want a slightly melted effect, consider scooping and adding the snowballs to the punch about half an hour before you plan on serving the punch. This will give the snowballs a chance to melt a little.
 Let your guests help themselves to the punch or ladle the punch into glasses ahead of time. Ensure that each glass has a melting snowball and consider topping the drinks with:


Whipped cream
White snowflake sprinkles
Mini-candy canes

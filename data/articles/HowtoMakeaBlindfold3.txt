 This blindfold is going to look more like a face mask rather than just a blindfold, but it fulfills the purpose if it is being used for something like a party game. You won't want to sleep in it though!


Although computer paper is fine, card stock will be better because it's more sturdy and won't fold and wrinkle as easily.
Using a darker colored piece of paper will create a better blindfold, but if you only have white, then double it up by using two pieces and tape, glue, or staple them together.
 Taking a pencil, mark about 2 and a half inches on each side from the top of the paper. This will be where you will attach your elastic.
 Taking your elastic, making sure it fits snuggly around your head with about an inch on each side to spare, attach it to your paper. The best way to do this for the most secure attachment is using a stapler. Attach it to the edge of your paper, where you previously marked the two inches.









Your staples can be any direction, but the best way to staple the elastic is to have the staple set horizontally along the elastic. You can staple it perpendicular to the elastic, but it won't hold the elastic as well and you will risk the elastic slipping out of it.
 After you've finished your blindfold, try it on and see how it fits. If it doesn't fit exactly right, then detach the elastic and staple it again so that the blindfold fits perfectly.


You can decorate this blindfold as well or if you want it be more comfortable, glue a strip of batting to the back of it where your eyes rest.
This blindfold is probably one of the easiest to make, but it may not be the most practical -- you may be able to see the floor with it, but if what you're using it for allows that, then it's okay.

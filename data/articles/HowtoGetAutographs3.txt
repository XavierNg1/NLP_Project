There are a handful of other websites that help you keep your celebrity addresses current.As previously mentioned, The Internet Movie Database is a great credible resource for information on people working in television and film. Find your celebrity by searching their name in the search engine provided.
Other sites like FanMail.biz and Celebrity Fans are other free online resources that offer some success with locating celebrity address information. On FanMail.biz, read the forums to check out the success and failure rates other fans have had with writing to celebrities for autographs.
 Athletes can be reached by contacting them directly through the team they play for. Send the letter at the player’s attention, c/o the team they play for underneath, and include the name of the stadium, and the address on the recipient portion of the envelope.Look at the official websites for the leagues to get a rundown of the teams and the official venues they call home.

 Celebrities are very busy people with hectic and demanding schedules. Have patience for the length of time it takes to hear back from an autograph request you’ve sent. Sometimes it takes weeks, sometimes it takes months. It can even take up to a year to hear back from a celebrity, so be patient.

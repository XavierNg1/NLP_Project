 Slowly pour the beans into the slow cooker, examining each bean carefully. If you find any rocks or unusually hard beans, remove them and throw them away. Otherwise, they may hurt your teeth while you’re eating.When in doubt, throw the bean away. For example, if you’re not sure if a bean is too old to eat or not, play it safe and discard it.
 For every cup (200 grams) of beans, you will need about three cups (.7 liters) of liquid. You can use fresh water, vegetable broth, or meat broth. However, make sure not to overfill the slow cooker.


Most slow cookers have a “fill” line on the inside. Otherwise, only fill the slow cooker halfway full.
 Sprinkle in seasonings such as onion, garlic, or bay leaves. However, wait to add the salt until the beans are cooked to avoid tough beans.Other delicious seasonings include:


Butter
Curry powder
Shallots
Ginger

, Place the lid on your slow cooker and turn it on. You can use the “low” setting to cook the beans for 6.5 hours, creating a creamy, soup-like texture. Alternatively, cook the beans on “high” for 3 hours to create a thinner bean dish.After one hour, sample the beans periodically to check for doneness. The beans will be done when they’re soft and flavorful.
 Salt and pepper the cooked beans to taste. After seasoning, serve the beans immediately. You can add extra cooking liquid to create a vegetable soup, on a bed of rice, or by themselves as a healthy side dish.


Leftover beans can be kept in the refrigerator for up to five days.

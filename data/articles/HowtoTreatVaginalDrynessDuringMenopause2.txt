 Talk to your doctor or your gynecologist about low dose estrogen, an effective treatment that can significantly improve your vaginal dryness. It can also help to restore vaginal tissue.Low dose estrogen is a form of hormone therapy, so you should use the lowest dose possible for the shortest time possible. Make sure you do not use estrogen right before any sexual activity as it can be absorbed by your partner.
Let your doctor know if you have had any hormone-sensitive cancers, such as breast or ovarian cancer, as this could conflict with the estrogen. If you still have a uterus, then you may need to take progesterone as well to help prevent cancer.
 Your doctor may prescribe vaginal estrogen in the form of an estrogen cream or tablet. You can apply the cream two to three times a week, at 0.5-1.0g/dose. Common estrogen creams include Estrace cream, Neo-Estrone cream, and Premarin cream.Estrogen tablets can be a bit less messy than applying the creams. Using an applicator, you will insert the tablet into your vagina twice a week.
Though low dose estrogen can help to relieve vaginal dryness, you should still use lubricant when having sexual intercourse to avoid any irritation or friction.
 Your doctor may also prescribe estrogen in the form of a low dose estrogen ring. The Estring estrogen ring is a soft, flexible ring that contains estrogen in the center. You will insert the ring into your vagina and it will release a low dose of estrogen every day for three months.If your vaginal dryness is severe and you are experiencing hot flashes, your doctor may prescribe a higher dose estrogen ring known as the Femring.

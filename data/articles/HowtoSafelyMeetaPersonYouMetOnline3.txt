 Even though things are going well and outwardly the person seems fine, you may have a nagging feeling that something isn't right. Don't ignore that feeling. If you feel like you're not safe, get out of there as quickly as possible.You don't owe anyone anything. If you feel that you need to leave, just do it â€“ especially if you feel like your personal safety is in jeopardy. Go to the restroom and call a nearby friend to help you.
You also may be able to talk to someone who works at the place where you met. Explain the situation to them and they may be able to help you.
 Before you meet up with the person, have several options in mind that will enable you to get out of the situation quickly if anything happens. Rely on your own transportation as much as possible.If you have your own car, drive to the meeting and park as close as you can. Don't go anywhere else where the person could potentially isolate you from your transportation.
Have a couple of options if you don't have your own car or are relying on public transportation.
 Always make sure that several people know exactly where you're going and when. Arrange for a friend to check in on you during the meeting so you can let them know if things aren't going well.Keep your phone on your person at all times, either with the ringer on or on vibrate so you won't miss this text or call.
You also can get a friend to drop by and act as though the two of you just ran into each other. Only try this if both you and your friend are capable of acting through the situation.
 If the meeting goes really bad, and the person turns out to be someone dangerous, report them to the local police as well as to the social media platform or dating app where you first connected.If you report their behavior to the website or app, you may be able to get them banned.
You also have the option of blocking them so that they cannot see your profile or contact you again.

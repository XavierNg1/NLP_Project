 So you might have found some packets inside a seaweed packet or something else. If it has had contact with food, it's better if you wipe it clean with a dry cloth or something and then wash the cloth. Don't wash the packet or else the gels will suck in the water but you will learn how to dry them up later on so it doesn't matter unless you want to do an extra job.;

 You can either simply rinse the apple(s) or use special vegetable wash to clean the apple(s).


Allow each apple to either air dry or dry with a paper towel. Never scoop into a wet apple as the fruit could slip out of your hand.
 Approach the apple the same way as you would a melon by creating a small, round ball using the scoop.
 Add a small squirt of lemon to the apples from time to time to keep them fresh, while they wait to be smothered in caramel or candy coating.
 Avoid overheating the candy, as it will burn. Consider starting off at 30 seconds in the microwave, remove microwave dish with candy, stir and return to the oven for another 30 seconds.


Use caramel once itâ€™s almost completely melted. Stir the candy until it blends together and is fully liquid.
 Make sure the stick is in the mini apple but not through the fruit.
 Coat well, by swirling the apple around the dish.

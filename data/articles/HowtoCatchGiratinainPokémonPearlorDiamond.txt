,,, Bring your Master Ball if you have one. Have high level Pokémon that are at least level 50 or higher.


You'll be in a cave, so Dusk Balls are very good balls to use to catch Giratina. Ultra Balls work well, too.
 A good Pokémon to use is a normal/flying Pokémon like Staraptor because Giratina's offensive moves (apart from Slash) won't hurt it. This comes in use because Giratina's move (Shadow Force) is also very powerful.
 You will only be able to access this path after you receive the National Pokedex.
, Go around in a circle through the grass until you find a wall you can climb down with Rock Climb. Enter the cave at the bottom of the wall.
 It is called this because once you enter a room from another, if you come back the way you came, you won't end up in the same room you came from. It can be very confusing as it is a maze.


You need to find your way past three pillars in the cave before you go through thirty rooms. If you encounter a pillar, it will tell you how many pillars you've passed (the number on the top) and the number of rooms you have been through (the number on the bottom.) Thirty rooms is a lot to go through and many people make it past three pillars and to Giratina before reaching that.
 It will automatically lead you to Giratina. Giratina will be standing there in a mighty way. Talk to it. The battle will ensue.
 It can be in the yellow, but getting it in the red is recommended. Try not to faint it. Ice, Ghost, Dragon and Dark type moves are very effective. Use Fire, Water, Electric, Bug, Grass and Poison type moves to get the health down slowly so you won't make Giratina faint.



If you run out of Poke Balls, get defeated or faint it, reset. In case you don't know the drill, always save before attempting to catch a very rare Pokémon if you can (which you can with Giratina before talking to it).
 Once you have caught Giratina, give yourself a pat on the back for it.

 For example, you want to attract and keep bees and ladybugs. They pollinate your flowers and eat unwanted insects.


Purchase ladybugs or their larvae if these insects are not showing up in your garden on their own. You can order them from distributors online, or check with your local garden shop.;
, Birds are natural pesticides. They will eat the unwelcome insects in your garden, so attract them to the area.


Use sunflowers to attract birds as well. If you plant them in your garden side by side like a hedge, you can also create a border around your garden to keep deer and other small animals out of your plants and flowers.
 Lightweight nets will keep insects off your plants and flowers without using any harmful chemicals.


Find netting that is transparent enough to allow sunlight to reach your garden. You can find this netting at home and garden stores or in organic produce shops.
 Your fingers can act as an organic pesticide. Pick off visible slugs, beetles and other insects.


Place the insects in a dish or bowl filled with warm soapy water to kill them.
Use a stick to brush moths and bugs out of trees or from branches and leaves you cannot reach.



Mix petroleum oil and water in a spray bottle. Spray the solution onto plants and flowers in your garden to repel insects.
 You can find organic products at home and garden stores such as Lowes and Home Depot, discount department stores such as WalMart and Target, and through online retailers.


Read labels. Make sure there are no chemicals or ingredients you do not recognize.
 Most organic pesticides will be sprayed directly onto plants, leaves, trees and flowers.


Try an organic pesticide that includes diatomaceous earth, which is a powder made from the fossils of sea creatures. It causes insects to dehydrate and die.
Use a product that includes garlic. Garlic is a natural insecticide and fungicide and works best on fruit and vegetable plants.

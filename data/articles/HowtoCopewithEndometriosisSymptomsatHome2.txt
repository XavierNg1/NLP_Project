 While research on acupuncture in conjunction with endometriosis has been limited, it may help with your condition. The best bet to find a good acupuncturist is to get a recommendation from your doctor's office.The limited amount of research done on the topic has shown that it helps with pain in some women and may even lift symptoms completely for other women., When you have cramps from endometriosis, heat can help take the edge off the pain. Try a heating pad on your back or front. You can also use a warm bath to help with the cramps., Prepare two small tubs with water. You should be able to sit in them. Some sitz baths fit over the toilet to make it easier. Fill one with hot water and one with cold water.Alternate sitting between the tubs, sitting 3 minutes in the hot water and 1 minute in the cold. Go back and forth to each tub three times. You can do it a couple of times a day.Do not make the hot water so hot it will burn your skin.
Do it about every other day but not when you are on your period., Massages can help if you have blockages in your uterus due to endometriosis. Ask your doctor for a therapist recommendation.

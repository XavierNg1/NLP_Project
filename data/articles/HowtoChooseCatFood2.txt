 Dry food is often cheaper and easier to maintain than wet food. Dry food allows you to leave the food out for the day without having to worry about it going bad. Most adult cats can thrive on dry cat food that is high quality. Make sure the dry cat food contains mostly animal proteins.Your cat may prefer dry cat food over wet food, especially if you introduce dry food to the cat early in its development.
 Wet cat food can be more expensive and takes a bit more effort to maintain. It can be a good option if your cat is prone to dehydration and urinary tract issues.Wet cat food is perishable so it should be given to your cat at feeding time as soon as you open it. You should then dispose of any remaining wet cat food so it does not go bad.
 Rotating your catâ€™s food can help them stay healthy and encourage them to eat at every meal time. Try giving your cat a mix of wet and dry food, alternating between wet and dry. You can also give the cat wet food one or two times a week and dry food the rest of the week, especially if you are on a budget.You can also try giving your cat different brands of dry and wet food to see which one it likes best.

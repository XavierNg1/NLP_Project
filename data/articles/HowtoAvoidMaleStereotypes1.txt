 You do not need Rambo style muscles to be masculine, no matter what anyone says. Plenty of girls like all kinds of body types, and sometimes "Rambo" is a turn-off.;
,, It's your body, you should change it only to make you happy.
 Men can eat more healthy foods and it does not take away from your manliness.
 Your diet affects all aspects of your life. The healthier a man is, the higher his stamina and the better his performance is mentally and physically. It doesn't hurt in the bedroom, either.

 At a minimum, you should have the following:


Passport
Visas - ask your passport office what visas are required for the relevant African countries for someone of your citizenship. Do this well in advance (in case you need to wait for visas).
Travel insurance
Cash - do not rely on being able to use automatic teller machines when traveling. Some places may not have them and others may not be functioning. Always have a second source of money. It also helps to have small US notes to give to people as tips, thank yous and to buy small articles.;

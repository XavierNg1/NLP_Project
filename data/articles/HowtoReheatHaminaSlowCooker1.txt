 The outside of the ham will typically have a layer of fat beneath the skin. Using a sharp knife, shave away both the fat and the skin until you reach the pink meat. Do this for all sides of the ham until there is no longer any skin or excess fat., The first ingredient to go inside of the slow cooker is the ham. Place it with the flat side facing down. The rounded side should be facing up towards the cover of the pot.If you are using a bone-in ham that you have not warmed up before, check the end of the bone to see if there is a plastic cap attached. If so, remove the cap before cooking.
 The liquid will cook the ham while keeping it moist. There are many different types of cooking liquids you can use based on what type of taste you want to give the ham. Water is the easiest and most basic liquid, although it will not give any flavor.You can also try:


Chicken broth
Cola
Apple juice
Pineapple juice
Ginger ale

, Set the slow cooker to its low setting, and cover the pot. Most hams will reheat in between three and six hours, depending on their size.A three pound ham may take two and a half to three hours whereas a six or seven pound ham may take up to six., About an hour before the ham is finished, you should baste the ham using the juices that have collected at the bottom of the basin. Use a baster or a ladle to scoop up these juices, and pour them over the top of the ham to keep the ham moist.If you are glazing the ham, you can use any extra glaze to baste the ham.
 A reheated ham should have an internal temperature of at least 140 °F (60 °C). Use a meat thermometer, and stick it in the thickest part of the ham. If the ham is not at the right temperature yet, put the top back on. If the temperature is higher, remove the ham immediately so that it does not overcook.

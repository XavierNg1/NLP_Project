 If your glasses are cloudy or have white streaks, clean them with vinegar. Fill a medium-sized bowl with white vinegar and warm water. Use two tablespoons of vinegar for every cup of water., Dip a clean cloth into the vinegar solution. Gently wipe down the glasses with the cloth, both inside and out. Re-moisten the cloth as needed to ensure that your glasses get clean., While the smell of vinegar is strong, it will eventually dissipate after drying. To speed up the process, rinse the glasses in cold water to wash away the vinegar solution. Rinsing the glasses, or washing them as you normally would with dish soap, will ensure that the vinegar smell disappears faster., If you have numerous glasses to clean, or if the cloudy deposits on your glasses are difficult to remove, soak them in a solution of equal parts white vinegar and warm water. Fill a basin with the vinegar and water, place your glasses in the basin, and let them sit for twenty minutes. After soaking, rinse the glasses with cold water and let them air dry.

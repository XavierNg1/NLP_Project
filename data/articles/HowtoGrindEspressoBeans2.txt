 If you are using a grinder with spinning blades, follow these instructions. Typically, these grinders have a detachable plastic lid, and turn on when the lid is pressed down, but some models are operated with a button or hand crank instead. They will not produce grounds as consistent or fine as higher-quality "burr grinders," but they tend to be much cheaper., Some grinders only have room for a small handful of beans, so you may have to grind in several batches if you are making a large number of espresso shots. Don't try to force the beans tightly into the grinder, or you may not have room for the lid., If you grind the beans for too long, the friction can overheat the beans, making them bitter. Instead, turn the grinder on for no more than three seconds at a time, waiting two seconds between bursts., The exact amount of time it takes to grind depends on the grinder model and blade sharpness. However, since espresso is typically made with finer ground beans than a hand grinder can produce, it's unlikely you'll be able to over-grind it. Grind it for at least twenty seconds total, not counting the pauses in between grinds., Unplug the grinder and remove the lid. If there are obvious chips of coffee bean in the grounds, grind the beans for a few more bursts. Otherwise, pick up a pinch of grounds between your thumb and finger. If it's ready, it should clump together on your fingertip, not fall off in separate particles.You may not be able to achieve the perfect fine grind with this type of grinder. If the grinder won't produce grounds with the consistency described, settle for no visible large chips of bean being present.
 There are usually hard-packed chunks of coffee grounds stuck to the inside of the grinder. Use a spoon to remove all of these grounds right after you're done grinding them. If you leave grounds in there for multiple grindings, they can burn and add an unpleasant taste to your espresso.

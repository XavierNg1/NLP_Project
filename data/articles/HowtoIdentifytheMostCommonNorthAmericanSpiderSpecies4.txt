 They prefer to hunt during the day and they jump on their prey, hence their common nickname.


Watch for jerky movements when this spider is walking. Although quite small, this spider can jump many times its own body length.
Observe its eyes; the 2 middle eyes are quite large when compared to the other 6 eyes.
 Most will stay in their burrows during the daylight hours.


Look for a very striking pattern on its knees, which will be bright orange or red. These vivid markings are unique to this species of tarantula.
Notice the carapace; it is black and will have a brownish-red color around the perimeter.

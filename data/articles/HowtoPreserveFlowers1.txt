 Crush one tablet of aspirin into a powdery mixture. Add to the water the freshly cut flowers are sitting in and gently mix to dissolve. This will keep the flowers fresh longer.;
, If you have a copper coin (cent, penny) or a small piece of copper, add it to the water the freshly cut flowers are sitting in. Add a cup of sugar as well. The flowers will last longer as the bacterial growth is inhibited.
 Mix 1/4 teaspoon bleach per liter/quart of water added to the freshly cut flowers. A little bit of sugar can also be added if wished.
 Pour about 1/4 cup unwanted soda into the vase of freshly cut flowers, along with the usual water. Use clear soda unless you want cola colored water!

, Mix 2 tablespoons quality vinegar with 2 tablespoons (29.6Â ml) of sugar. Add to the water the freshly cut flowers are sitting in. The water should be changed every few days, re-adding the vinegar mix.
 Place a few drops of any clear spirit, such as vodka, in with the water the fresh flowers are sitting in. Add a teaspoon of sugar as well. This will curb the growth of bacteria that starts the flower rot. The water should be changed every two days and the drops of spirit and sugar re-added to the new water.
 This method helps the flowers top-end. Simply point hairspray about 2 inches/5cm away from the flowers and spray underneath both flowers and leaves (leave the upper sides unsprayed). This is good when combined with one of the water-added solutions above.

 If you chose eyes, then wear more makeup on the eyes. Use colors that accentuate your eye color. Avoid anything on your lips, except chapstick or a clear lip gloss. If you want to accentuate your lips, choose a color that goes well with your skin tone. For night, wear darker shades, while bright fun colors are great for day. Go very light on the eyes. Use only a little bit of eyeliner and neutral shadows; don't go crazy and do smoky eyes.;
, It's an easy, natural, and beautiful look, especially for daytime. At night, feel free to play around with darker, mysterious shades, but limit yourself 1-3 colors, depending on the occasion.
 Blend them in so it looks natural. Use cover-up, if needed. Then apply blush that compliments your skin tone. Pale girls usually look better in peachy tones, while darker skinned girls usually look better in deeper shades of pink.
 A smokey eye, little black dress, black heels, a big plastic bracelet, and a simple necklace is just the right amount to wear for a fancy night out. Also, try not to wear a lot of makeup if you're doing elaborate hairstyles.

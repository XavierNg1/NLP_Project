 Unit fractions are fractions that have 1 as the numerator. The bigger the denominator is in a unit fraction, the smaller the fraction is.

The numerator is the number above the fraction bar. It tells you how many pieces you have.

The denominator is the number below the fraction bar. It tells you how many pieces the whole is divided into. The more pieces the whole is divided into, the smaller one piece is.

For example, to compare 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}}, 13{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}} and 16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}}, look at the denominators, 4, 3, and 6. Since 6>4>3{\displaystyle 6>4>3}, 13>14>16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}>{\frac {1}{4}}>{\frac {1}{6}}}.
 Because these fractions have the same denominator, that means you are working with same-sized pieces of a whole. All you need to do then is compare how many pieces you have, which is given in the numerator.

For example, to compare 16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}}, 56{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}}, and 36{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{6}}}, look at the numerators, 1, 5, and 3. You have one piece, five pieces, and 3 pieces. Since 5>3>1{\displaystyle 5>3>1}, 56>36>16{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}>{\frac {3}{6}}>{\frac {1}{6}}}.
 Remember, the bigger the denominator, the more pieces the whole is divided into, and therefore the smaller each piece will be.So if you have the same number of pieces, by comparing the size of the pieces, you should be able to compare and order.

For example, to compare 47{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{7}}}, 45{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{5}}}, and 49{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{9}}}, look at the denominators, 7, 5, and 9. A whole cut into 9 pieces has smaller pieces than a whole cut into 7 pieces, and a whole cut into 7 pieces has smaller pieces than a whole cut into 5 pieces. So 45>47>49{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{5}}>{\frac {4}{7}}>{\frac {4}{9}}}.
 A benchmark fractions is one you can easily visualize, such as 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}.By comparing the fractions you are working with to a benchmark fraction, you may be able to use reasoning to determine their order.

For example, to compare 58{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}}, 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}}, and 37{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{7}}}, compare all of these fractions to 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}. You should see that 58{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}} is a little more than 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}, because 48=12{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{8}}={\frac {1}{2}}}. On the other hand, 37{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{7}}} is a little less than 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}, because 3 is less than half of 7. (3.5 is half of seven.) 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}} is exactly equal to 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} So, you can reason that 58>24>37{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}>{\frac {2}{4}}>{\frac {3}{7}}}.

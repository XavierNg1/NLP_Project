 Early symptoms of nicotine poisoning are hyperactivity/acting overexcited, agitation/restlessness, disorientation, constricted pupils, excessive drooling/salivation, vomiting, diarrhea, and panting or having trouble breathing. This may occur within 15 to 20 minutes of ingesting a tobacco product.More advanced symptoms include twitching, tremors, seizures, muscle weakness, coma, collapse, increased heart rate and cardiac arrest. These symptoms can occur within 15 to 90 minutes of ingesting a tobacco product.;
, Try to avoid doing this, especially if you think the poisoning is due to the ingestion of e-juice from e-cigarettes. Since the e-juice is absorbed through the mucous membranes in your catâ€™s mouth, inducing vomiting is ineffective., Do this once you are aware that your cat has been poisoned. Do not try to treat your cat at home first. The successful recovery of your cat depends on rapid medical treatment. Therefore, the sooner your cat can get professional medical treatment, the better.If you do not have a vet, then take your cat to the nearest veterinary hospital, or call the Pet Poison Helpline at 1-800-213-6680 (U.S.) or 01202-509-000 (UK).
If you want, you can bring the suspected source of poisoning with you to the vet.

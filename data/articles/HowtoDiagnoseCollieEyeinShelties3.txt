 If your dog is diagnosed CEA, the condition shouldnâ€™t worsen. Most dogs live long, healthy lives with little eyesight problems. Unfortunately, there is no treatment or cure for CEA.Awareness of the condition is crucial. Affected dogs should not be bred since the genetic mutation can be passed down to the offspring.
 In Shelties, the numbers affected by CEA are considerably higher in Europe than in the United States. The incidence in the US is thought to be around 0.39%, which means around four dogs in every 1000 are affected., CEA can be associated with other problems, like a coloboma, which is like a crater that forms around the optic nerve. Sometimes, the retina separates completely from the choroid and the dead space can fill with blood.If your dog has a coloboma, your dog can get surgery to help with that.Surgery may also be suggested if there is a threat of retinal detachment.

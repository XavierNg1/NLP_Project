 Though you should encourage the child to work through their homework on their own, you should stay close by and offer any help or assistance when needed. You may answer any questions they may have about an assignment or review the assignment together to ensure the child knows what is expected.Try to encourage the child to come up with an answer on their own before you help them. You do not want to do their work for them or allow them to lean on you too much.
If you notice the child has reached their threshold, but they have not finished their work, do not try to force them to keep going. Speak to their teacher about assigning less work so the child can still get some work done.
 You can be positive and supportive of the child by setting up a system of rewards for their hard work. You may use snacks to encourage your child to stay on track, such as cut up fruit. Or you may allow them to do a fun activity once they have completed their homework.You can also use verbal praise as a reward. A simple “Great job!” or “Excellent!” can encourage the child to stay positive and focused as they do their assignments.
You should offer the child a reward if they get good grades on their homework. You may take them on a fun outing or get them an item they really want as a reward for doing well.
 You can keep the child motivated and positive about school by making sure they are organized. Pack their backpack with them the night before to make sure they have all their school books, supplies, and assignments together in their bag.You should also make sure they have put their completed homework in their bag so it is ready to turn into their teacher. This will ensure the homework ends up in the right hands and that the child gets graded by their teacher.

, Choose the restaurant you want to order from.


You can decide how far away the restaurant is by clicking on the "within minutes" range. This goes anywhere from 10 to 50 minutes from where you reside (and will also depend on whether the restaurant delivers over certain distances).
You might want to read reviews on relevant sites before ordering, unless you've used the restaurant before.

Click on the button that looks like a shopping cart.
Type in your promotion code (if any).
Click on "Place order for take-out," "Place order for delivery," or any other options your restaurant has.

 To do this go to the Build section, then to Garden Center, and select Gardening. Place any types of trees on the lot. Seven trees is often a good amount.


Don't put the trees in a greenhouse, or else the bugs won't gather.;
, Doing this is simple, and can be done in two ways.



Normally: Let the trees sit around for a few days. They should start to gather bugs.

Using cheats: Press Ctrl+⇧ Shift+C and type in boolProp testingCheatsEnabled true, and hit ↵ Enter. Then, infest the trees with bugs by shift-clicking them and selecting DEBUG - Infest with bugs. Afterwards, disable cheats by pressing Ctrl+⇧ Shift+C and typing boolProp testingCheatsEnabled false, and hitting ↵ Enter.
 Have your Sim spray the infested trees by clicking on them. You will need to have your Sim spray the trees at least 15 times to have a chance of making a Plant Sim, although it often takes more than 15.
 Your Sim must continue spraying the plants without a break, or it might not work. Once your Sim has sprayed the trees enough times, a cloud of smoke will surround your Sim and turn them into a Plant Sim!


If you ever want to make your Plant Sim a normal Sim again, all you have to do is call up the Garden Club by clicking the phone and choosing Service. Once they come, simply buy the Plantophic-C potion and direct the Plant Sim to drink it.

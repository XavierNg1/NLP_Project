 Divide a group of people into two teams. Be sure there is plenty of water bombs for each team. Once you begin, the objective is to hit an opposing team member with your water bomb. If someone is hit, they have to sit out until the end of the round. The last team standing wins.


If you're only playing with water balloons, someone could catch a water balloon without it breaking to get the thrower out. This would also allow someone who is out from your team to come back into play.
The rules are parallel to dodge ball.
 Gather a group of friends and either one sponge ball or several water balloons. Nominate someone to be "it" and hand her the bomb. Then the point is for her to run around and try to hit someone. Once she hits someone with the water bomb, that person becomes "it.", You'll need to use a water balloon for this game and it requires two people. Start with the two people close together. One person must toss the water bomb to the other person. After each successful catch, each person takes one step backwards. The objective is to see how far you and your teammate can go.


For a twist, pierce a hole into the balloon using a thin needle., You'll need at least four people, two beach towels, and some water bombs. The point is to place a water bomb in the center of the towel and try to volley it to the other teams towel. After each successful catch, each team must take one step away from the other team.This game is more exciting with water balloons because they have the potential to break.
 Prepare a challenging target practice with everyday objects like empty cans or bottles. Prepare the target range somewhere outside away from people. Position yourself about 20 feet (6Â m) away. If you hit more than three in a row, move back a couple of feet.


Challenge your friends and see who has the best aim.

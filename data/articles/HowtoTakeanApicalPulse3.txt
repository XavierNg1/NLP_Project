 A pulse is a palpable and/or audible heartbeat. Pulses are most commonly assessed as pulse rate, which is a measurement of how fast an individual’s heart is beating, measured in beats per minute. A normal pulse rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Pulse rates faster or slower than this may indicate a problem or disease. They also may be normal for some individuals.


For instance, highly trained athletes frequently have very low pulse rates, while someone exercising may have a heart rate higher than 100. In both of these cases, the heart rates are respectively lower or higher than one might expect in most situations, but do not represent a problem.
 In addition to the pulse rate, pulses can also be analyzed by assessing the shape of a pulse: is it a smooth beat, or does it seem weak? Is the pulse bounding, meaning that it feels sharper than usual? Weak pulses may indicate that someone has low blood volume in their vessels, making the pulse harder to feel. Bounding pulses might indicate stiffer arteries, as the blood vessels will not be as able to accommodate the increase in blood with the heart’s pumping.
 There are many places on the body where one can feel a pulse. Some of these include:


The carotid pulse: Located in the neck on either side of the trachea, the stiff tube in the front of the neck. The carotid arteries are paired, and carry blood to the head and neck.
The brachial pulse: Located inside the elbow.
The radial pulse: Felt on the wrist at the base of the thumb on the palmar surface of the hand.
The femoral pulse: Felt in the groin, in the fold between the leg and the torso.
The popliteal pulse: Behind the knee.
The posterior tibial pulse: Located at the ankle on the inner side of the leg, just behind the medial malleolus (the bump at the base of the lower leg).
The pedal pulse: On the top of the foot, in the center. This pulse is often difficult to feel.

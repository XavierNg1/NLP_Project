 The idea behind this method is that, if your dog hears birdsongs frequently—especially in locations where the dog is otherwise calm—it will be desensitized to the sound of birds and no longer chase or bark at birds outdoors.Find a bird recording online on a site such as YouTube, and play it around the house at a low volume.


If your dog is initially excited and tries to “find” or “chase” the bird, play the recording at a lower level.
At this point, your dog will start to acclimate to the soft birdsong and will stay calm while the sound plays.
 As you increase the volume of the birdsong, your dog should become desensitized to louder levels of birdsong.Once you can play the sounds at a “normal” level—approximately the volume of birds outdoors—try bringing your dog outside. The outdoor sounds of birds should stimulate your dog no more than the indoor bird recordings.


Your dog should be desensitized to the birdsong, since it has heard it so frequently indoors.
 Once your dog is outdoors and is well behaved, calm, and is less inclined to bark at or chase birds, you should reward the dog. Praise your dog for its good behavior, pet it, and give it treats to reinforce its calm behavior.If your dog continues to act out by barking at or chasing birds, bring it back inside. Vary the types of birdsongs that you play. This will desensitize the dog to a variety of types of birds. The next time that you bring the dog outdoors, it is more likely to disregard the sound and presence of chirping birds.

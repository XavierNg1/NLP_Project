 LEGO customer service warns against using washing machines due to the risk of damage from heat or tumbling.> Many LEGO bricks have emerged from the machine unharmed, but that is not necessarily true for your bricks and your washing machine., Detach all pieces from each other unless they are stuck by grime. Set aside all pieces with stickers, printed ink, moving parts, electrical parts, or clear plastic. These must be scrubbed with a dry towel or alcohol wipes to avoid damage from the tumbling.
 A fine mesh clothes bag will prevent the bricks from jamming the machine, and minimize damage to the bricks from tumbling, although scratching is still possible. You may use a pillowcase if you do not have a laundry bag, but make sure to close it tightly with a zipper or a rubber band., Any temperature above 104ºF (40ºC) has the potential to melt LEGO bricks.
 Mild laundry detergent is recommended to avoid scratching. Read the labels on eco-friendly detergent if you're having trouble finding one marked mild.
 Lay the pieces out on a towel on their sides or base so water can drain. Keep in a ventilated room to speed up the drying, but keep them away from heat. They may take one or two days to fully dry, depending on humidity.

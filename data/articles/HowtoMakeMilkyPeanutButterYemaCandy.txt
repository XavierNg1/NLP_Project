 Add the blended mixture to a saucepan and boil for a few minutes just to dissolve the sugar particles.;
, Just before you turn the stove off, add the powdered milk and mix through thoroughly. Don't worry––it is supposed to have a powdery texture when you eat it.
 Drop evenly sized little blobs of the mixture onto a non-stick surface, such as a silicone sheet or sheet of wax paper to cool. Once each candy has cooled, it is ready to wrap.
 Wind the top to keep the wrapper in place, or tie with raffia or similar. Finished.

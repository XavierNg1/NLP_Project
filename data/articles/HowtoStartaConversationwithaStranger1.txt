 Everybody there is in the mood for a good time, and unless they're wearing a scowl that says, "Don't even think about invading my personal space," the person you want to talk to is probably in the same mood.;
, If it's possible, try to make eye contact. If you do, you're off to a good start. Smile warmly, and make your way towards them.


If you can't catch their eye, work your way over to where they're standing, touch them gently on the shoulder as you cross in front of them. If there's somebody already standing in front of them, stand beside them.
 It doesn't matter a whole lot what you say to get the conversation started. It's more about how you say it. If you can deliver the best opening line in the world with confidence, go for it!


If not, stick to something more basic, such as "Hi, my name's Mark," and offer to shake hands.
 Talk about how you ended up at the party, and ask them how they came to be there, too.


If the weather is remarkable, remark on it, but don't dwell. Weather conversations are generally short, boring, and indicate that you don't have much to say.
 What sports and hobbies do they enjoy? What classes are they taking, and what's the end result? (Degree, job, etc.)

, This is the key to good conversations. Being able to truly listen to the other person and asking questions about the things that interest them is not just a great way to make conversation, you may end up with a new friend as well.
 Volunteer things like your name, and anything that's a good conversation starter such as "Hi, my name's Penny. I'd offer to shake your hand, but I broke my arm while rock climbing last weekend."


If there's something you happen to share with the other personâ€”a sport, a love of food, a favorite political candidate, by all means, share. The goal is not to be silent, just do not introduce yourself to somebody for the sole purpose of talking about yourself.

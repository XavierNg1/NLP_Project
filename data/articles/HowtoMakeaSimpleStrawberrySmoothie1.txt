 While the recipe calls for 10, you may need fewer or more, depending on their size. And depending on your smoothie craving!


It'll be easiest on your blender if you cut off the tops and then cut them in half.
Make sure you're using a clean knife and cutting board!;
, A Magic Bullet or food processor will work, too.
 2% will make for a creamy, thicker smoothie, but non-fat, soy, and almond work, too. If you don't have milk, yogurt works as well.
 For a thicker, colder smoothie, throw the ice in the blender with everything else. However, if you'd like your smoothie to be more concentrated (at least initially), you can just put the ice into the smoothie when it's finished. Decisions, decisions.
 Depending on the strength of your blender and the size of your ice cubes, this should take anywhere from about 15 seconds to a minute. It may need a stir to get the last chunks of ice smoothie-ready, so break out your spoon if need be. Did someone say taste test?

, If the strawberries are sweet enough, you may not need the extra zing. Or if you'd like something more natural, honey is a great alternative. It's a good idea to try it out and see. If you add too much, you can always add more strawberries or milk!

, Cut a strawberry in half, then slice half of it so you can put it on the edge of the glass for a garnish. Grab a straw, your cocktail umbrella, and you're set.


A chilled glass is even better -- it keeps the smoothie from becoming runny too quickly. Keep one in the freezer for the next time a smoothie craving strikes without warning.
 The recipe above makes one strawberry smoothie. Watch out -- smoothies have been known to bring boys and girls to the yard, too. Hope you have extra ingredients on hand for when you're expected to share!

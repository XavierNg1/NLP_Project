 Make sure that it fits securely. Shake the canister a few times.Check the directions to make sure that you are holding the canister correctly.
 At the same time, press down on the other nostril with your finger. Close your mouth, and push the canister down just as you slowly breathe in through the one nostril receiving the medicine. Make sure that you take in the medicine. Do the same with the other nostril, making sure that you press down the nostril that just received the medicine. Do not take more than the specified amount of sprays.Don't sniff or inhale too hard or the medicine may drip down the back of your throat. If this happens, try to spit it out.
, After you have finished using your nasal spray, it is advisable to wash your hands again.Particularly if you are using a nasal spray temporarily to treat congestion from an illness, you will want to wash your hands to ensure that minimal germs are present on your hands. This helps to prevent others from catching your infection.
 Many nasal sprays take consistent use before they become maximally effective. Wait at least 2 weeks (or whatever time-frame your doctor recommends, as it can vary depending on the type of medication) before evaluating the results of using the spray.Do not take more than the recommended number of doses prescribed by your physician. Just like any other prescription medication, if you find that it is ineffective (or taking longer than you expected or hoped to work) that does not mean to double up on your dose. It could be dangerous to do so, so be sure to stick within the recommended limits of your doctor.
The dosing of nasal sprays is variable and will depend upon what medication is contained within it.

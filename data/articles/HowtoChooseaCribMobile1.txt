 The best bet for getting a safe mobile for your babyâ€™s room is to go with a trusted brand name. Consumer reviews of popular products may add to this assurance. You can always look up recalled products to ensure that the model or brand you have in mind has not had units recalled for safety reasons., Make sure that all safety standards for baby mobiles are met before you make a purchase. For instance, strings on a mobile should be less than seven inches long to prevent choking. Hanging objects should also be examined to ensure that they are not small or detachable.Mobiles are not safe for babies older than 5 months, or babies who are able to push themselves up onto their knees.
 If you opt for a crib mounted mobile, make sure that the connection is secure and stable, with sturdy clamps and/or heavy duty Velcro. You should be able to swing the mobile out and away from the crib when it's time for your baby to go to sleep, unless it's a musical mobile that plays lullabies to help him/her sleep.
 Old or secondhand mobiles may not meet today's safety requirements (e.g. requirement for maximum string length of seven inches) and should be avoided.Used baby items may also be frayed or worn, which can cause a safety issue.Toys hanging from an older baby mobile might be more likely to fall off or break, which could harm your child.

 Wax sticks can be purchased at hardware stores, where they are sold for use in patching deep scratches and gouges in wood furniture. They are often available in multiple shades, so you should try to match the wax stick to the wood's existing finish.
 Applying firm pressure, run the wax stick lengthwise along the deep scratch. As you do this, the scratch should fill in with wax. You may need to make several passes for very deep or awkwardly shaped gouges.
 When the cut is completely filled with wax, drag a putty knife (or the edge of a credit card) across the surface of the wood to remove any wax that is sitting above the surface. Allow the wax to dry and then buff it with a soft cloth.

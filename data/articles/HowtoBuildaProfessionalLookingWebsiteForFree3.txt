 Coding is intimidating to begin learning but the truth is that there are more free resources than ever to help you get started. First you'll need to consider the type of site you are aiming to build. This will determine the type of coding you have to use; for example, flash visual-heavy sites tend to emphasize JavaScript, whereas a script-based site might utilize HTML.
 Some common web design languages include HTML and CSS, Java, and Python.


HTML and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) tend to go hand-in-hand: HTML is responsible for creating the core structure of any basic webpage, while CSS dictates aspects of the webpage like theme, color, and layout. Both are fairly basic programs, and thus are recommended for beginners. Python and Java are higher-level codes used by advanced programmers to create dynamic sites. Both are well-suited to high-traffic sites such as Amazon or Yahoo Maps.
 There are a ton of sites that will teach you entry-level coding for free. GitHub, CodeAcademy, Khan Academy, and Code Avengers all offer unique and interactive ways to learn HTML and CSS webpage coding. These resources are all easily accessed, and should be more than sufficient for most webpage coding needs. If you're interested in more advanced coding literature, MIT Open Courseware, edX, and Google University Consortium both offer free courses in Java and Python. , Focus on learning your language of choice and make it a priority, but don't expect to learn an entire language over night--this will take time! While knowing how to code basic webpages and templates is the end goal, keep in mind the fact that webpage coding is a marketable skill; thus, you should absolutely consider branching out into more advanced territory as you learn.

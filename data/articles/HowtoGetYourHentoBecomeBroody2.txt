Consider giving this method a try., If you have access to fresh herbs, the addition of some fresh herbs to your hen’s nesting box may encourage her become calm and broody. Lavender and chamomile are particularly effective., Your hen may avoid becoming broody (or even laying eggs) if she does not feel clean and safe in her nesting box. Check to be sure that her box is free from mites, insects, mice, and other intruders in order to ensure her comfort and safety.

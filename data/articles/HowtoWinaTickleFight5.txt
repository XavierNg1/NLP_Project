 This is another great move to try after you've already debilitated your victim with a few tickle moves.
 Keep your knees at his sides.
 Wrap a firm hand around each of his wrists.
 This will take some shifting around.
, You can alternate between the chest and stomach and the armpits and ribs. Gauge your opponent's reaction to see which tickle tactic is the most deadly.
 Just make sure your opponent is debilitated at this point, or he'll be able to fight back with his hands.

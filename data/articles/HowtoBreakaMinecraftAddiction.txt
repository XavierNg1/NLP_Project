 If you are spending excessive hours on Minecraft and or the game takes up too much of your time and gets in the way of you doing things, especially blowing people off or not doing things to play Minecraft, then you may have a problem.;
, Minecraft players will every now and then come to a point where they are bored. If you're at a time when you can't seem to be entertained by Survival, Creative or by Minecraft servers, just exit the game and find something else to do. (Preferably something that isn't a video game- but it's up to you.)

, Try and set a limit for yourself- try to cut down how long you're on Minecraft. You can do this by setting a timer on your phone, or with Parental settings on your computer that can kick you off at a certain time.
 Be more social, sign up for a club or a sport, get more involved. Or play a different game.
 If all else fails and you think it is necessary, you can delete Minecraft from your computer. You can do this by deleting Minecraft.exe as well as the .minecraft folder located inÂ %AppData%. If you think you are tempted to download it again, you can use software to block the file from running on your computer.

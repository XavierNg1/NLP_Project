 Do this if you don't have any large objects to complement them. Use objects that have something in commonâ€”color scheme, pattern, subject matter, etc. Arrange them in a manner that both shows off their variety and unifies them as a single work of art.For example, imagine you have three small vintage posters featuring forms of transportation. One depicts a car; another depicts a train; the final one depicts an airplane. Look at each poster's use of line, shape, and color. If the airplane poster has more vertical lines than the other two, hang that one in the center., Choose this option if you have an even number of objects with similar dimensions. Imagine a vertical line in the center of the arrangement. If you have a laser level or painter's tape, let that be your vertical axis. Then, start arranging your hangings on each side of the line in a mirror-image fashion. Make sure your artworks are evenly spaced.For example, let's say you have two rectangular paintings and two smaller square paintings. You would place the two paintings immediately to either side of the vertical axis. After that, you would hang each square painting on either free side of the rectangular ones.
 Choose this option if you have several objects of different sizes. Use the largest or most prominent object as the center of the arrangement. Position it at eye level. Group the smaller objects around it in some kind of logical fashion.

For example, if you have a mixture of round and rectangular vintage prints, try alternating each shape., Spruce up an nightstand, mantle, or desk with sculptures or two-dimensional art. Lean framed paintings, prints, or photographs against the wall as an eye-catching backdrop. Frame these two-dimensional works with lamps, flower vases, or antique bookends. Place small sculptures, candles, or mantle clocks in front of them.

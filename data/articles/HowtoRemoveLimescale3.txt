 To adjust the level, flush the toilet and while it is flushing, turn the screw of the adjustment level counterclockwise. Do this until the bowl of the toilet is empty or almost empty., Mix two to three cups of white vinegar with equal parts borax. Pour it directly into your toilet bowl, making sure the areas affected by limescale are under the liquid. Leave it for two hours to allow the borax and vinegar to dissolve the limescale., After you have let the limescale soak, return to the toilet and scrub vigorously with a scrub brush with the vinegar and borax mixture still in the toilet bowl., After scrubbing, flush the toilet to let the vinegar borax mixture go down the drains. The water should wash away any remnants of limescale. If you still see limescale, do another scrub of the toilet and flush it again. Repeat until all the limescale is gone.Donâ€™t forget to readjust the level on your toilet.

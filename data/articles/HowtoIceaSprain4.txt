 Knee injuries are more serious and require professional care. If you suspect a sprained knee and have not already done so, consult your doctor. You may require treatment beyond icing., The layer of towel or cloth will protect your skin.


If you do not have an icepack, you can substitute a plastic bag filled with ice instead.
 Leave the ice on your knee for 15 to 20 minutes. Repeat this step 3 to 4 times during the day. Continue this process for several days, or until there is no more swelling or pain.

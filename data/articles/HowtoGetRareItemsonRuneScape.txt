 Holiday events will provide you with items (and emotes) that you can use for bragging later on. Repeatable or ongoing event items, such as the Ornate Katana or Dwarven Army Axe, can only be obtained through membership, and in some cases membership only through game cards.;
, This is members-only, of course, but if you are lucky, you could get gilded armor of various kinds...or better! Even beginners can reap big rewards from level one clue scrolls!

, Other players may lend you their items for short periods of time, and it doesn't cost as much as buying the item itself.
 This could set you back thousands upon millions upon billions of coins, but obtaining rare items isn't easy anymore.
 If you remain a member for several months, you can accumulate several points for rare items and emotes.
 There are many rare items (such as "lucky" weapons and summer-themed gear) on the wheel.
 They are only available by spending RuneCoins (a currency you can buy with real-world money), giving you an edge over those who can't afford them.

 Dentists say that brushing your teeth should only take two minutes,but that doesn’t mean that you have to be stationary while you do it! You can turn on the coffee maker, take out the trash, or do something else while you are brushing your teeth.


Carry around a paper cup with water, so you can rinse your mouth if you are walking a pet outside or taking your things to the car.
 Eating breakfast increases alertness,which will allow you to get to where you need to go faster. Luckily there are a lot of different varieties of breakfast foods that you can eat on the go like granola and protein bars or different varieties of fruit. It might be tempting to skip breakfast altogether, but eating in the morning will give you more focus and will help you throughout the day.


Try eating something healthy or filled with protein so that you have the energy to get to your destination quicker.
 If you have things to prepare for where you need to be, like a briefcase, backpack, or bag, make sure that while you’re packing up your car you’re also getting your morning drink. You don’t have time to sit down and relax, you need to be somewhere on time.


If taking your bags to the car is the last thing you do before you leave, put your morning beverage in a to go container so you can drink it on your way there.
 If checking your email is part of your job, there’s a likelihood that you can’t ignore them in the morning. If you absolutely must check them, you can do it while walking your dog or feeding your cat. Tending to a pet in the morning is a huge time waster, so try to combine it with something productive.


If you only use your email for personal reasons, you can drink your morning cup of coffee or eat your breakfast while you tend to your pet.

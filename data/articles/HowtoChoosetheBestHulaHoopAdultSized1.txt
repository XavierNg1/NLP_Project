 This measurement will then help to determine the diameter of the hoop you should purchase. The hula hoop, when resting vertically on the ground, should reach somewhere between your waist and mid-chest. This is your base diameter measurement and can be adjusted slightly depending on your size and experience level. For example, most adults will begin with a hula hoop between 40 and 44 inches in diameter. ;
, If you are smaller than average you can take 2–4 inches (5.1–10 cm) off of the diameter determined by your height. Similarly, if you are larger than average you should add 2–4 inches (5.1–10 cm) to the diameter determined as a result of the previous step. , If you are an experienced hula hooper you should use a smaller hoop. Similarly if you have a background in dance or are in good shape you can likely start with a slightly smaller hoop. For example, experienced hula hoopers can take 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) off of the diameter size determined by their height.
If you are having trouble keeping the hoop up for at least 5-10 seconds then it is likely too small and you should use a larger hoop.

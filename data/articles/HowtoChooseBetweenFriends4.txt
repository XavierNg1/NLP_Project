 You should make sure you are absolutely certain you understand what brought you to this point. There could be many possible reasons why you feel it is necessary to make a choice between friends, but the circumstances and context will most likely have an impact on how you approach it.


Figuring this out at the start might mean you can find a way around choosing, and can reconcile the situation instead.
 It can happen that two friends have invited you to different events on the same day and you can only go to one. This could be a cause for friction, but needn’t lead to any serious falling out. It’s a good idea to go to the first event you were invited to. Explain to your other friend that you can’t go to her event, because you already promised you’d be somewhere else. Instead, offer a special day for just the two of you to make up for it., Knowing someone for years and years doesn’t always translate into a deep and lasting friendship. As you grow older you change in all sorts of ways and you may find that you don’t feel as close to someone as you used to.You can outgrow a friendship, so think about this and don’t blindly choose the person you have known the longest.
 If you’re struggling to deal with all the stress from the situation, talk to your parents about it. They were young once too, and can give you some advice about how to deal with the situation. They will give you a fresh perspective which can be very useful. Be honest and direct with them, and they will respond in the same way.Bear in mind that your parents’ main concern will be you and your happiness and wellbeing.
You could also talk to other friends about it, but be sure that you can speak in confidence.

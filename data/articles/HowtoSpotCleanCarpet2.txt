 Find an empty spritzer bottle, or empty one and rinse it out completely. Fill the bottle with vinegar, or dilute it halfway with water.Some stains that vinegar will typically remove are soda, juice, milk, jelly, mud and various food-based stains.
 Test the vinegar in a hidden spot to make sure it wonâ€™t fade or damage the carpet. Then spray the spot so that it is totally soaked with vinegar. Allow the vinegar to sit for 10 minutes so that it has time to work., After the vinegar loosens the stain, apply pressure to the cloth with the palm of your hand. Rinse the cloth and repeat this process until the stain is completely removed from the carpet.

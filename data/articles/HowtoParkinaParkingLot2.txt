 You will want to be far enough away from other cars in the parking lot to be able to turn into a spot. Make sure your car is at least 8 feet away from any other parked vehicles on the driver's side or passenger's side.
This will depend on if your parking space is on the left or right of your car.
If there aren't any cars parked near you, try to judge an 8 foot distance from the spaces to your car.
Don't take someone else's parking spot that they have been waiting for.
 This will let other drivers know you are going to park in a free space. Take a quick look for any cars, pedestrians, or other obstacles.
Move forward slowly.
Drive forward until the front bumper of your car is just past the taillights of the car next to your parking space.
 You will need to turn a little bit more sharply than if you were parking in an angled space. 








Begin to do this as your front bumper passes the taillights of the car in the parking space next to yours.
Drive forward slowly.
Make sure there aren't any shopping carts, debris, or objects in the space as you pull in.
 Do this until the front of your car is at the back of the space and the rear of your car is entirely in the space.









A good way to do this is to align your side mirrors with those on the car beside you.
Make sure your front bumper isn't creeping into the space in front of you.
Check to make sure the rear side of your car isn't sticking out of the parking space.
 Do this after your car is entirely in the parking space. 








Your wheels will need to be straight when you back out of your spot.
You can also do this when you are leaving your spot before you start to reverse.
It is best practice to do this right after parking, however.

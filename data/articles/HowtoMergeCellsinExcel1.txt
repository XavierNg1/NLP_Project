Keep in mind that merging cells can delete data. Only the data in the upper left cell will be kept once the cells have merge. Do not place data in every cell if you plan on merging the cell space.
If you want to merge cells, but there is data in 1 of the middle cells, copy the data using your "Edit" Menu and paste it in the upper left cell.
 It is best to choose cells in a single row or a single column, since it will make learning the command easier.
 Your command will depend upon the year your Microsoft Excel program was created.


Newer versions of Excel will allow you to access the "Merge" button on the "Home" tab of the formatting toolbar. Look for the "Alignment" section of the formatting options or click the arrow to the right to see more options.
Older versions of Excel require you to click on the "Format" menu and select "Merge" from the options in the drop down menu.
 This will merge the cells and place the data in the center, creating a more attractive presentation.


You can also choose "Merge," which will place the data in the upper left, or "Merge Across."

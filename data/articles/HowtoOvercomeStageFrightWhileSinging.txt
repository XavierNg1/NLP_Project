 The reason why most people get stage fright is fearing they're gonna make a mistake. So, if you know your song inside and out, the anxiety should go down. Make sure you choose a song that fits your vocal range (you could add a note out of your range to wow your audience!) But, don't strain your throat!;
, This article is based on singing (but some of these tips apply for all). Sing a scale in your range and go from there. When you're in public you can hum to warm up your voice. Humming can be used if you're speaking also and is a great substitute for singing your scales. Also, if your song doesn't go in a scale order or if you want a challenge, try singing "do, me, so, ti, re, ti, so, me, do" and etc. Or you can practice dynamics with your voice and etc.
 Make sure you don't drink milk this day. It clogs up your throat. Instead, drink water. Make sure you warm up and run through your song a few times (don't do it too much because you will strain your throat!). While waiting to perform, breathe slowly. Don't talk to anyone who will distract you or let you down. Do calm exercises like yoga, deep breathing, and etc. Thirty seconds or so before you go on. Drink a small gulp of water and stay quiet. You might be REALLY nervous. When you perform, look slightly above the audience, judges, and etc. So you'll be performing to the wall!

, While performing or practicing, if you make mistakes then don't be hard on yourself. Take it easy. If you give that mistakes too much of attention its most likely going to drive you to make more mistakes. So when you make a mistake while you are performing...

Accept that you made a mistake.
Move on.
 As clich√©d as this is, have fun! You're doing something you love! Put your heart into it! But if you mess up, that's ok. Everybody makes mistakes. If you stay calm about it. They might not have noticed. If your voice cracked, it's not the end of the world!

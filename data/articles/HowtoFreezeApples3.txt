 Fill a large bowl with cold water and add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of salt per 1 gallon (4 liters) of water. Stir until the salt is completely dissolved.


The salt acts as a preservative, prolonging the amount of time you can store the apple slices without them going bad or getting freezer burn.
 Add the apples to the salt water and let them soak for a few minutes.

Depending on how many apple slices you have, you may need to do this in batches.






Make sure the apple slices are submerged under the water. If they will not stay beneath the surface, gently press them beneath the water using a spatula so all sides are exposed to the salt water.
 Pour the contents of the bowl through a colander to drain the apples.


If you still need to use the salt water for additional batches, drain the apple slices by removing them with a slotted spoon.






Do not rinse the apples.
 Spread the slices out as much as possible to prevent them from sticking together while they freeze.


Squeeze out as much excess air as possible as you seal the bag.






You could also use a freezer-safe plastic food container, but be aware the apple slices will likely freeze together into a solid mass if piled on top of one another.
 The slices can stay fresh for 6 to 12 months when frozen using this method.


Try to keep the bag as flat as possible during this time to prevent the apples from freezing together.
Apples frozen using this method are especially suitable for pies, baked apples, and other sweetened, baked apple dishes.

 When you are training your Great Dane puppy, you should keep your sessions short. They should last no longer than five minutes at first. Your Great Dane puppy will have a very short attention span, so you need to make sure you can keep his attention by having short training sessions.


As he gets older, you can increase the length of your sessions., Make sure you stop your training sessions on a positive note. Once you notice your Great Dane puppy getting distracted, go ahead and quit your session. End it by requesting him to do a simple command that you know your Great Dane can perform. This way, you will be able to praise him at the end of the session.


This will leave your puppy feeling happy with himself, which will make him a happier dog., Your Great Dane will eventually get used to the treat and reward schedule that you developed in the beginning. When this happens, you should make your schedule and methods much less predictable. Instead of giving a treat every time you Great Dane does something right, skip a few to keep him guessing.


This makes him wonder why he didn't get a treat and will make him work harder in the future to get the next treat or reward.
Over time, skip two or three instances that you would typically reward until you are only rewarding every fourth or fifth behavior. This will be far enough apart for him to work for it but close enough together to encourage good behavior. , When you reward your Great Dane, try to vary the types of treats you give him. These treats don't have to be food related and can vary depending on your or your dog's mood. Try bites of food, dog treats, praise, or play time with his favorite toy.


Your Great Dane will let you know which activities he likes the best. This may be tugging on his favorite chew toy or eating a bite of his favorite treat.
You should also use different treats on different days.

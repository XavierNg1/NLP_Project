 Be polite to your date and the people around you. This means using respectful language, giving them your undivided attention, and arriving on time.


Pay attention to your date. Don’t use your cell phone unless you absolutely have to. Be punctual. Being late shows that you don’t respect your date’s time. If you are running late, give him or her a call to say when you will arrive., Pay close attention to your date as you interact. Notice his or her tone of voice and body language. These cues can let you know if they are having a good time.If your date looks uncomfortable for any reason, try changing the subject or suggesting a change of activity.
 The activity you choose to do will dictate what is appropriate. Try to dress on the nicer side no matter what you do. There is no need to go overboard, but looking nice shows that you care.For men, wear a button down instead of a T-shirt.
For women, spend a little time on your hair or wear a cute blouse.
No matter what, it is important to feel comfortable. Don’t wear something that doesn’t fit your personal style or makes it hard for you to move around.

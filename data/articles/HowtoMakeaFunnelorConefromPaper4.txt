 If you have a solid idea what you're making a cone for beforehand, it helps to consider the material you'll be using. Certain types of paper suit certain projects better than others.


Printer paper is fine for purely decorative cones. It offers a lot of potential to be coloured or drawn on.
A thick construction paper is best if you're making party hats.Parchment paper is a good choice if you're making a funnel to bake with.
 If you're making a cone for the sake of baking, a funnel is needed. Take a pair of scissors and cut the tip off. From that opening, you'll be able to control the pour of icing or syrup by squeezing the funnel.


If your funnel hole isn't big enough, you can try to cut it again. Keep in mind, however, that the higher you cut up the cone will result in an exponentially bigger funnel hole. It's best to keep your funnel cutting careful and restrained.
 If you're making a decorative cone or a party hat, it's fun to add a pattern. Take your favourite pencil crayons or markers and draw something. Patterns (like jagged edges or swirls) are best for a cone, but you can also draw words on it. For the sake of a party hat or dunce cap, writing a word (like "Happy Birthday") can help to specify the cone to the given occasion.


Draw a pattern in with pencil first if you're worried about making mistakes.
It may be easier to draw your pattern on the paper before you make it into a cone.
 Although you should try coming up with ideas yourself, it can be inspiring to look up creative projects other people have done. Experiment with different cone-making techniques. Decorate your cone with a fresh type of material. The possibilities with home crafts are endless.

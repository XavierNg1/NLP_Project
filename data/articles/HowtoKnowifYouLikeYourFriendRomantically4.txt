 If you need - take a break and take as long as you want for any of the mind games.
 It's a fairly happy but solemn choice from your subject and they're looking a little sad to let you go. Try these three excuses:


"I don't have time for a relationship..."
"I don't think it's working out - we're different. But someone else will really adore you."
"It's not you, it's me. I just don't think we should continue this."

, How does each feel? Keep them in mind and even jot them down on a pen and paper.
 Your subject is clearly angry and frustrated. They are obviously sick of you and aren't hesitating to show you so. They are fairly happy about they're choice and seem relieved, too. Try these 'exclamations':


"Ugh! I have had enough of you whining/- it's so annoying! Look, I don't feel the same way about you any more, so please leave me alone!"
"Oh my God! Just shush! I hate you, OK? I can't do this any more!"
"Look, I hate to break your heart - but this isn't working. I don't like you anymore, sorry."

, How do you feel? Are you happy or bewilderingly sad? Why?

, Happy, sad, relieved, angry, anxious?

 This is called the mise-en-scene, a French term that roughly translates to visual storytelling.


Keeping in mind that what you see in the scene is not the entire location but only what the director has decided to show, ask yourself why the director chose to show this part of the location and not another. This works equally well for scenes shot on a sound stage rather than on location, because the set will only comprise a part of the location it represents.
Note which characters and objects are in the center of the scene and which are in the background or periphery.
Study which parts of the scene are out of focus and whether this changes during the scene.
Pay attention to how the scene is lit. Note whether it is brightly lit or in shadow and whether the light has a particular hue. Think about how the scene might play if the lighting is changed.

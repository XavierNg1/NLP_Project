 One of the most important things to remember when dancing at a rave is to keep your body loose. Rave dancers tend to wave their arms and hands and use their whole bodies when they dance, so do the same. Shake out your stress and warm up your whole body so you're relaxed and at ease like the rest of the dancers.;
, You can wear whatever you want to a rave, but it’s often considered appropriate to wear some more exciting clothing too. You can wear shirts with LED lights, or tutus, or giant furry costumes with wings, or just jeans and a t-shirt. Loose, casual attire was what was originally worn when raving started. It’s the easiest to dance in.
Kandi clothing that fluoresces under ultraviolet light has become very popular too.
 Regardless of what kind of clothing you decide to wear to your rave, you absolutely must wear comfortable shoes. First of all, there are going to be tons of people dancing around you. There’s a good chance someone will stomp on your feet if you are wearing sandals. Secondly, you’ll be dancing yourself the whole night. You want to be comfortable.

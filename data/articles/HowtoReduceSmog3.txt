 While America has done a fair job in passing laws to protect the environment, many countries still don't regulate environmental pollution levels (Haiti and Malaysia have the poorest regulations).By not supporting commerce from countries or organizations, you raise awareness of the problem.


You can also boycott companies that add to the pollution problem. For example, companies like Nestle, Pfizer, and Walmart have been known to not only add pollution to the air but to also violate pollution regulations.An app such as Buycott can help you identify products and companies with poor environmental track records, simply by scanning a product's bar code., Don't be afraid to tell people your opinion on the issue, and what you are doing to help solve it. You can do this by speaking to those closest to you (family, friends, co-workers) or reach more people through social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube).


Start a community project such as an initiative to replace light bulbs or a carpool to a farmer's market once a month.
Start a carpool with your co-workers. Not only will it cut down on emissions but it will demonstrate your passion for the cause.
 Ask them for information about what they are doing to reduce smog levels in your community. If they do not reply or reply with inadequate measures, consider lobbying for change.


Sign a petition. There are many petitions online that are lobbying for better air quality control by our government. Find one that peaks your interest, or start your own.
Try sites like change.org or petitions.whitehouse.gov to look for petitions or start one on a smaller, local level.

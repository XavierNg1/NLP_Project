 Post stuff on twitter and Instagram to make sure even more people get to see your content. Make sure that there is a link to your Facebook so that they can find you and friend you there for even more content and posts. Try not to overlap the content too much: you want people to feel like they have a reason to follow you on every network, not just one!

, To give people even more of a connection to you, have a blog. This can be on Facebook but keeping it on a separate site would be better, since it will help increase your audience. Make sure your blog content is just as interesting and personal, so that people are invested in the things you write down. Have a link to your Facebook and encourage people to friend you there.
 If you do have a blog, find ways to advertise your blog elsewhere to draw in even more people. Find communities which are interested in the kind of content you post and comment, telling them to friend you to find all sorts of cool new stuff.

 These can include cows, pigs, chickens, and other peaceful mobs, as well as hostiles. You'll need to have an idea before building the zoo, so that you know what sorts of structures are needed to contain them well.;
, A suggestion to do would be creating a 10 block by 10 block square for each mob's pen. Avoid counting any wall space.


After all the pens are done, you could put little stands next to each pen, with Squidward or villagers.
 For cows, you could put a plains area with a tree or two and some tall grass and flowers. For zombies/skeletons, you could make a cave and have water outside so they don't burn.
 You can make them out of any material, but it's preferably at least one row of glass. For hostile mobs, you must make a roof or covered area inside.
 You can make them out of any material, but for example sand.
 If you are in creative you can spawn them. In survival, you have to lead them to your zoo, and some will be impossible, like bats(1.4), squids, etc.
 You could try to get Testificates to come by using minecarts or spawning them.

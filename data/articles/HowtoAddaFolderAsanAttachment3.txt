 If you are running Windows 2000 or earlier, you'll need to download compression software such as WinZip to compress your folder. Similarly, users of Mac OS 9 may need to download StuffIt Expander.
 Most Linux distributions include a built-in ability to compress files. For example, in Ubuntu, right click on the folder and choose "Compress..." from the context menu. You will be asked to choose a name and location for the resulting archive. Attach that archive to your email.

 That is the number one driver, as you don't want to feel constricted or overheated. Most maternity clothing will fit the pear shape just beautifully, so enjoy the shopping.
 Just ensure that the fabric has plenty of stretch without being saggy. Darker colors may be overwhelming during pregnancy, so feel free to lighten up the colors to befit your mood.

 Whether it’s over winter break or just for the weekend, a projector rental can really enhance a gaming event.;
, Be sure to get input from everyone – kids and adults.
 As a family, decide when to host your tournament, what the rules will be, which games will be played, how the winner will be determined, and what prizes will be awarded.
, Build up some anticipation for the event, and plan food and snacks for your gaming tournament. Put it on the family calendar and prioritize this event as special. Plan at least a week or two ahead, which should give you plenty of time to arrange for that projector rental (not to mention a little friendly smack-talk!)

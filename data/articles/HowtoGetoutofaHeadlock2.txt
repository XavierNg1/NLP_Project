 Turn your head toward the side from which your attacker is choking you. This will ensure that your airway doesn’t get cut off. Use your hands to grab onto your attacker’s arm, with your fingers on the inside of her arm, near your chin., Raise or shrug your shoulders so you create a space where you can tuck your chin down to your body and get your fingers into the space between his arm and your chin. Aim to tuck your chin into the crook of his elbow; that is where there will be the most wiggle room.Sink down in his hold by bending your knees.


This will make it more difficult for your attacker to lock his arm onto your neck.
 On the side that your attacker is choking you, step your foot back behind her foot to lock in her leg.Don’t arch your back backward. Instead, keep your back curved forward. If you lean back, you render yourself defenseless with no balance.
Do not step out to the side, but back, behind her foot so your legs are calf-to-calf.
 Bend your knees and turn 180° toward your stepped foot.Your hands should still be on his arm, in between your chin and his arm. Once out of the headlock, pull diagonally across your body to throw your attacker to the ground.


Keep your opposite foot (the foot that didn’t lock behind your attacker’s leg) strong so as to trip your opponent as you throw him to the ground across your body.

 Although several of the characters are quite similar, each has their own personality quirks and differences. For example, though Ronnette, Crystal, and Chiffon seem very similar, Ronnette is the leader, confident and smart, Crystal is witty and flirtatious, and Chiffon is the cute, funny, innocent baby.
 Each character has her own personality and has little habits that can be played up and down at times. For example, Chiffon can be a little nervy and will bite her nails, while Ronnette is quite loud and rolls her eyes a lot. Understand your character's personality and come up with little habits or tics to help you more fully embody the character.
 The characters can be played with plain American accents, but to make it a little more fun, you could even try doing a New York City accent and play that up to emphasize your character's personality. However, if you don't feel like you can do the accent particularly well, don't feel the need to do it! A bad accent can break a performance and slipping back into your real accent will make your character seem unbelievable and flat.

 School may seem boring, but it is important to try to do well. Good grades will give you more options in the future. Make sure to jot down any homework or test deadlines when you get them so that you don't forget to complete them and prioritize your study deadlines. When it is recommended to write notes from your classes, write notes, as this is one of the best ways for informing your revision before writing essays and sitting exams.


If there's something you don't understand, ask somebody! Read it through carefully again, and then if you still don't get it, ask a friend or a teacher. Despite what people might imply, there is never such a thing as a dumb question; it is better to get clarity than to stew in the dark, unenlightened.
When you get home from school, do a quick recap on what you learned that day. This will help you for when you need to revise it as it cements the day's learning and is much easier than cramming at the last minute. And while it may not seem like it now, learning-as-you-go creates long-term remembering whereas cramming trains only short-term memory and prevents you from truly learning and having access to that information in the future.;
, This sounds like a no-brainer, but doing your homework effectively doesn't just mean sloppily writing something down and handing it in. Do your best on every assignment, and as already stated, ask questions when you don't understand something. Plan a homework schedule so that you don't get yourself into a time crunch.
 This is especially important in high school because you may need to ask a few of your favorite teachers to write recommendations for your college applications. The better they know you, the better those recommendations will be. But more than this, these people can serve as mentors and guides as you move through high school and you can learn much from their knowledge and experience.

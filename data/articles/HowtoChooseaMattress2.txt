 Look online for reviews of mattress stores in your area, and plan to visit more than one. This will give you a broader view of the available options. If you see a mattress you love at the first location, you can always go back.
 Get a feel for different mattress types by trying out mattresses of varying levels of thickness and firmness. If a mattress doesn't feel comfortable in the showroom, it probably won't feel better at home.


Test more expensive mattresses first, to experience what a high quality mattress feels like. Compare it to the lower end mattresses until you find one that meets your requirements for both comfort and cost.
Spend more than 10 seconds lying on each mattress. Allow yourself to actually rest for a minute. If you're too tense or impatient with the process you won't get to experience how it actually feels to rest on the mattress, and you may be disappointed once you bring it home.
 Most mattress salespeople are open to throwing in a few extras or lowering the price to make the sale. If you're paying full price, ask if they'll include a box spring, bed frame or pillow top.


Make sure your mattress comes with a warranty, so that you'll be able to return it to the store if you change your mind or if it turns out to be defective. Most warranties allow you to return the mattress within 30 to 60 days.
Most mattress purchases include free delivery, and some companies will dispose of your old mattress.

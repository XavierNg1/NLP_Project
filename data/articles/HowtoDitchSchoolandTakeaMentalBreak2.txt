 Make sure to do this a couple of days before you cut school, or they may want to tag along.
 Try not to be noticed of seen by many people in the hallways. Hiding in the bathroom stalls normally works.
 Security guards don't check the cameras until five minutes to the bell. If you drive, this will be fairly easy. Just get in your car and pull out.


However, if you walk, this will be easy as well. Just walk the route most kids of your school walk. If a teacher asks you where you're going, which they rarely to almost do, tell them your running to the gas station to get chips for lunch, or getting a drink of water or something out of your locker.






If you catch the bus, make sure to know a different route than everyone else. Nothing is worse than having 30 kids see you at school.
 Enjoy the feeling that rides over you from fear and happiness. Your head will feel clear and free. Take a moment to enjoy it, close your eyes and bask in it.



Hitting small thrift stores while cutting school can be fun and easy. No one usually shops during morning hours, so the selection will be greater. Even if you hate thrift stores, you can browse through the racks. It's always temperature controlled in places like that. Make sure to bring about $10 to $15 dollars in hand.






Libraries are cozy and safe. You can catch up on music, read books, write stories, anything! You can even stay away from people in small, secluded corners.






Try the park. It's free and you'll be basking in the nice air.






Go to the movies. No one can distinguish who you are when you're sitting in a dark room. Morning movies are cheaper, so you'll be able to catch the latest blockbuster at a low price.






Avoid real public places. This includes malls, amusement parks, and around other schools. Many officers patrol areas nearby, and might ask questions if you're seen.

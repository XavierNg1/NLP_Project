 The most common way to eat canned tuna is by making a tuna salad. Typically, this consists of mixing canned tuna with mayonnaise and a variety of chopped vegetables, such as carrots, celery, cucumber, or tomato. Then add salt and pepper to taste.


Tuna salad can be served on a sandwich or over a bed of greens. This creates a simple and tasty meal.
 Tuna casserole is a tasty and simple way to incorporate tuna into your diet. To make tuna casserole, you will need to combine canned tuna with noodles, cream of mushroom soup, peas, onions, and any other vegetables. Then bake the dish in the oven and finally sprinkle with cheese before serving.
 Canned tuna can also be used to make tuna patties that can then be served as burgers or eaten on their own with a bit of tartar sauce and lemon juice.

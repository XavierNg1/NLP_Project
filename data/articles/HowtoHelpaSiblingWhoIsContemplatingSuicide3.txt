 Are you on the fence about telling someone about your sibling's suicidal comments because you are not quite sure if they are legitimate? Remember, all suicidal threats are serious. Look for these and other signs that indicate suicidal behavior:Showing no hope for the future
Talking about death frequently
Giving away possessions
Feeling like a burden to others
Withdrawing from friends or family
Neglecting personal responsibilities (e.g. work, school, or extracurriculars)
Making visits to loved ones or acting as if he is saying goodbye
Seeking out means to cause harm (e.g. weapons or pills)
Acting recklessly; using drugs or alcohol; practicing unsafe sex

, Then, follow through. If you need to go away assign another family member to be with her. Never leave her alone.


Take note: if your sibling requires constant watch to prevent suicide, she should probably be under medical and psychiatric care in a hospital.
 To prevent your sibling from committing suicide, you and your family should remove all items which can be used fatally from the home. These may include knives, razors, firearms, and pills., If your sibling is in an acute crisis and seriously contemplating suicide, you and your family need to get her to the nearest hospital as soon as possible. If, for some reason, you cannot get her to the emergency room, call 911 or your local emergency number., If an acute suicidal situation is occurring after your sibling has established a relationship with a counselor or therapist, call this professional to make him or her aware of the circumstances. Likely, this person will want to come to the hospital to talk to the doctors there.

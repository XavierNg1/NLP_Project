 You cannot capture a wild Onix in Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald, and you can't transfer from Gold, Silver, or Crystal. This means you'll need to trade from FireRed or LeafGreen, which are the only compatible games that also have an Onix., You'll find Metal Coats held by wild Magnemites and Magnetons.

Both of these Pokémon can only be found in New Mauville.
 Onix will need to be holding this item in order to evolve into Steelix when traded., You'll need to trade the Onix to someone else to cause it to evolve into Steelix. You can trade with Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed, and LeafGreen., You'll need to be physically next to the person you want to trade with:

Connect the two GBA systems with a Link Cable.
Head to the nearest Pokémon Center in both games. It doesn't have to be the same Pokémon Center.
Go to the second floor and talk to the person in the middle of the room to start a trading session.
Approach the PC in the trading room and select "Trade."

, As soon as you both confirm the trade, Onix will be traded and will evolve into Steelix., You'll need to have the other player trade Steelix back to you in order to get it. You can start another trade from the trade room.

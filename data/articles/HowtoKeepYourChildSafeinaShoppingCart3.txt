 Many strollers are large enough to place groceries into. Though you may not be able to buy everything, you may be able to pick up must-needed items and place them in the bottom of the stroller or in the various compartments.When doing this, make sure to be careful how you spread the weight. Try to evenly distribute the items so you donâ€™t tip the stroller to one side.
 If your child is old enough to walk through the store, let them walk alongside you instead of placing them in the cart. This can eliminate any danger with the cart.Make sure not to let the child ride on the side of the cart.
Praise your child for behaving and staying near you while you shop.
 If you can, shop without your child. Leave them at home with a partner, family member, or friend. Some supermarkets or stores offer childcare services that you may be able to use. Drop your child at the store-provided childcare so you can shop undistracted.If a store in your area offers online shopping, try that. Many supermarkets allow you to shop online and pick up your groceries when they fill your order.

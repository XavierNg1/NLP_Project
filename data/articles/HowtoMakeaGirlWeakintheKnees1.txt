Be genuine with your compliments. Most girls have the insight to tell when someone isn’t being genuine so make sure the compliments you say come from a true place.;
, Ask the girl about the things she’s interested in to get her talking to you. Find common interests you share to create a bond with her, or take the time to learn more about something she is interested in. Use questions that will encourage her to share with you."What is your most treasured memory?"
"What would be your perfect day?"

, One thing most girls want from their partner is their undivided attention. This conveys that you will be there for her and that she will be your number one.Listen to her when she talks and validate her by acknowledging what she said. This needs to be more than just an “uh-huh” or “yes, sweetie”.
Be an active listener by rephrasing what said and repeating it back with a follow up question., Eye contact is an important part of communicating and flirting with a girl. Good eye contact can make her feel a connected to you and not be able to get you off of her mind.Lock eyes with her while she talks to you and gaze lovingly into her eyes.

Smile when you look into her eyes.

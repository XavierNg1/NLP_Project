 If you've scheduled a future ride in the Uber app, you can cancel it without incurring any fees.
 You'll see this in the upper-left corner of the Uber app screen.
,, If you have multiple trips scheduled, scroll until you find the one you want to cancel.
 As long as you're canceling before any driver has accepted your ride, you will not be charged a cancellation fee.

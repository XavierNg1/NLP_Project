 The best evidence you'll have that credit card fraud has been committed is a credit card statement showing purchases that you didn't make. As soon as you notice strange charges on your credit card statement, file a report right away.
 Call your credit card company and follow instructions to speak with the credit card fraud department. Explain the situation and say you want to cancel your credit card immediately due. Take steps to get the fraudulent charges removed from your account as well.


Report the fraud immediately to avoid charges. Federal law states that if you report the fraud within 2 days, you will only be responsible for $50 of the fraudulent charges. If you wait more than 2 days, you could be responsible for up to $500 worth of charges. If you wait longer than 60 days, you may be responsible for all of the charges.Even if there was just one fraudulent charge on your credit card, you should cancel the card and get a new number, so the person won't be able to use your card again.
If you think your card number was stolen online, or was stolen as the result of using an insecure website, you might also want to report it to the IC3 at www.ic3.gov/default.aspx.
 Call all three credit reporting agencies to obtain your credit reports. Check over the reports to see if your credit was affected by the fraudulent charges. Look carefully to see if any new credit lines were established in your name. If you see anything suspicious, take steps to correct the errors.

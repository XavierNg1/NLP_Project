 If you’re worried about getting in trouble for having a nose ring or your parents won’t let you get one, how about trying a fake one?


A piercing is a serious decision. A fake nose piecing can allow you to test out the look with no regrets.Nose piercings are painful. Why go through the pain when you can fake it, and still get the look! Try a magnetic or spring hoop ring. These look real but they don’t require an actual puncture. Another positive is that you don’t risk having a scar.
 You have a lot of options when picking a fake nose ring, so play around with the look and feel.


Some fake nose rings are actually clip-ons that use small magnets that are placed on the inside of the nose. The nose ring itself shows as a small stud or bone that is attracted by the magnet.
Fake nose hoop rings work differently. They come with a small spring that looks like a disc. The spring clips the nose ring onto the nose. These fake nose rings look real to most people.
 You can get these at common accessory stores. Take a hair straightener, and melt the little ball at the end so it’s flat and sets against your skin.


Take out your regular nose ring. Take petroleum jelly. It will make it easier for the clear nose ring to insert into your nose. Put it on the spot where you have the nose piercing.
Put some of the jelly on the actual nose ring. Stick it into the nose. Wipe off the extra petroleum jelly.

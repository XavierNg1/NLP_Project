 Put the Play-Doh into a small cup or bowl, then squeeze a drop of water onto it. Do not douse the dough. Go slowly, one drop at a time, so that you don't use too much. Try to fill in the cracks.If you are working with a large amount of Play-Doh, feel free to start with more than one drop of water. Try using a teaspoon-full.;
, Use your fingers to work the water deeply into the dough. Roll the Play-Doh into a ball, stretch it out, pull it apart, and fold it into itself. If the Play-Doh is still hard after 15-20 seconds of this, add another drop of water and keep kneading., Continue to add water and knead the Play-Doh until the putty is soft again. Don't worry if the dough is wet and slimy â€“ just keep kneading.Within a few minutes, the dough should be soft and pliable as new.

 Feed your pet twice a day at regular times, or as recommended by your vet. Some dogs prefer eating later in the day.


If the dog is healthy and energetic, but gets distracted before finishing, set his food down and walk away. Come back in a half hour and pick his dish up, even if he hasn't eaten all of his food. It won't take him long to realize he needs to eat when he has the chance.
 Have the dog play with a toy with food hidden inside. Teach your dog new tricks and offer healthy treats or food as a reward.
 To make the dog's food more palatable, you can stir in a few spoonfuls of canned dog food or pour a little warm water or broth over the top.


Alternatively, use dog gravy. You can buy this from pet stores. These are just granules that you mix with dry food and warm water that can make the food far more tasty for the dog.
 If the dog still won't eat, try these variations. It may take a little time for your dog to adjust to the change, but they may help in the long run:


Feed your dog away from other pets.
Use a different bowl or place it at a more comfortable height.
Feed directly on the floor instead of in a bowl.
Some dogs get distracted by activity and have trouble focusing on their meal. Make sure your dog's food and water dishes are in a quiet spot where he can eat in peace.
 Try a different brand, or switch from dry food to wet food. Make the change gradually over a week: mix 1/4 new to 3/4 old for a few days, then half and half for a few days and so on. This will be much easier on his digestion.


Changing a dog's brand of food suddenly can cause obnoxious gas and diarrhea.
 Make sure all food products are fresh and stored in a closed container to keep moisture and pests out. Check the expiration date on foods when you purchase them and check often when they are stored.

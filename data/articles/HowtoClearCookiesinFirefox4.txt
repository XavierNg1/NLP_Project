 You can find the "Firefox" button in the upper left corner of the Firefox browser window.






The Firefox menu will open in a two-column drop-down menu after you click on this button.
 Hover over the "Options" option in the right side of the Firefox drop-down menu. The "Options" sub-menu will pop out from the side. Click on "Options" at the very top of this sub-menu.


"Options" is the fifth sub-menu title from the top of the right column.
Clicking on the second "Options" will open a separate dialogue box.
If you are using a Mac instead of a PC, look for "Preferences" instead of "Options." The other steps will all remain the same.
 The "Privacy" panel icon is the fifth icon along the top of the "Options" dialogue box.


This icon is labeled as "Privacy." Above this label is a masquerade mask which acts as a graphic icon for the "Privacy" panel.
The "Privacy" panel will open within the "Options" dialogue box already opened.
 Look for the "Firefox will:" setting under the "History" subheading of the "Privacy" panel. Click on the adjacent drop-down box and change the setting to "Use custom settings for history."


Once you select "Use custom settings for history," a new list of checkboxes and buttons should appear. These new options will allow you to customize your privacy settings in greater detail.
 This checkbox is located around the middle of the newly expanded history settings.


The "Accept cookies from sites" box is checked by default, so you will need to manually un-check it.
Note that this setting will not take effect until you close the "Options" dialogue box.
 This button is located at the bottom of the "Options" dialogue box, and clicking it will both save your new setting and close the box completely.

 Wrap each individual cupcake in plastic wrap, then place several wrapped cupcakes into an airtight plastic freezer bag.The double layer of protection should help reduce moisture loss while protecting the cupcakes from freezer burn. Moreover, wrapping them individually before storing them together allows you to thaw whatever amount you need rather than forcing you to thaw the entire batch.
 Arrange frosted cupcakes in an airtight, freezer-safe plastic container.


An airtight container is vital; otherwise, the cakes and the frosting may develop freezer burn.
If you'd rather use plastic wrap than plastic containers, you can do so, but the process is a little trickier. Freeze the cupcakes uncovered for one hour, or until the frosting seems solid and no longer sticky. Insert a toothpick through the top of the frosting and the cupcake, then tightly wrap the entire thing in plastic wrap.
 Place the packaged cupcakes in your freezer and use them within two or three months.


Under the right conditions, some unfrosted cupcakes may last for up to six months, but leaving them in your freezer for that long is not recommended.
 Roughly two or three hours before planning to eat the cupcake, remove it from the freezer and place it in your refrigerator. During the last 30 minutes, remove the cupcake from the refrigerator and let it continue thawing on the kitchen counter or table.


Alternatively, you can skip the refrigerator and thaw the cupcake entirely at room temperature. Pull it out of the freezer one to two hours before you intend to eat it when using this option.
Loosen or remove any wrappings once the cupcake sits out on the countertop. Doing so should help prevent condensation from building.

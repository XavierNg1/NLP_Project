 Make sure not to get the wick wet. Light the candle in the center of the pan of water.If you are using a tea light candle, it will sit in the pan on itâ€™s own. If you are using a tall slender candle, it may tip over. To avoid this, use a short candle holder to stabilize the candle.
 Flip the glass upside down and set it overtop of the candle. Make sure that the opening of the glass is completely submerged in the water. This provides a seal that prevents air from entering the glass and allows the water to rise into the glass.If the candle is touching the glass, you can either get a shorter candle or a taller glass. This will ensure that the experiment goes well.
 As the candle burns, it heats the gas inside the glass. This will cause the gas to expand, raising the pressure inside the glass. Some gas will need to escape the glass to relieve the pressure.. The only way for gas to escape is through the water at the bottom of the glass. Once the pressure gets high enough, the gas will have no choice but to bubble out through the water. , The burning candle converts two oxygen molecules (2O2) and one molecule of paraffin wax (CH4) to one carbon dioxide molecule (CO2) and two water molecules (2H2O). With no air entering the glass, the candle will burn all of the oxygen available. When the oxygen runs out, the fire on the candle can no longer burn.Though there may be oxygen left in the glass, the candle will go out when it has used up all of the oxygen that is close enough to fuel the flame.
 When the candle burns out, the remaining gas will cool quickly. The cooling gas contracts (shrinks its volume) and creates a vacuum in the glass. The outside pressure will force the water into the glass to fill the vacuum. This will be easier to see if you chose to color the water with food coloring. Keep in mind that the water will only fill part of the glass, since there is still some gas trapped in the glass.

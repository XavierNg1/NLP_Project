 You can start with a rectangle instead, but a square will make a cone with predictable shape, not too squat or too thin.Use a ruler to measure a square in a piece of paper, then cut off the rest of the paper. If you don't have a ruler, you can instead fold one corner of the paper across to the opposite side to make a square, then draw a line to show where the extra paper needs to be cut off.


Don't crease the paper when you fold it.
If you want a cone opening with width w, make a square with length w÷0.45, or slightly longer. (This is calculated from Pythagoras' Theorem and the circumference of a circle, then rounded from w÷(√2/π).)

, Cut across the paper diagonally with a pair of scissors or a utility knife. This long, diagonal edge of the triangle will end up being the base of the cone.
 Lift one corner of the triangle, next to the longer side, and bring it over to the corner of the two short sides to form a cone shape. Glue, tape, or staple the paper together to keep it in place.


You can adjust the sharpness of the cone by moving the corner to a different spot on the triangle, instead of lining it up with a corner.
 Roll the cone over the remaining side of the paper to complete the cone. Tape or glue the edges where they meet.

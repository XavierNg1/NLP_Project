 Another way to make healthier sugar cookies is to replace the wheat flour with almond flour and to use vegan ingredients like coconut oil and agave nectar. To begin making these sugar cookies, turn the oven to 350 °F (177 °C) (176 C), and grease a cooking sheet with butter or a butter alternative.These gluten-free cookies are also vegan and paleo, so they are suitable for many kinds of diets.
 Once you have preheated the oven, pour the five ingredients into a food processor and blend them on a medium setting until the dough is smooth and the coconut oil has melted and blended with the other ingredients.If you don’t have a food processor, first melt the coconut oil in a double broiler. Then combine all ingredients in a large mixing bowl and mix vigorously by hand until you have formed a dough.
To melt the coconut oil in a double broiler, place an inch (2.54 cm) of water in the bottom of a double broiler, then place the coconut oil in the top pan of the double broiler. Put the double broiler on the stove over medium heat and stir the coconut oil until it has melted.
 After you have combined the ingredients into a dough, spread a large sheet of plastic wrap on the counter. Scoop the dough on top of the sheet of plastic wrap, then fold up the corners of the plastic wrap to completely wrap the dough.


Work the plastic wrap covered dough, squeezing it into a ball shape with your hands.
 After you have covered the dough in plastic wrap and have formed it into a ball, place the ball of dough in the fridge for ten minutes. Chilling the dough makes it smoother and easier to work with.

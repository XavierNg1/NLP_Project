 Like Likes can only be damaged by your sword, arrows, and bombs. All other weapons, like the Boomerang or the Hookshot, is useless against these creatures and will simply bounce off of its body. If you want to use a sword on Like Likes, have it ready.
 Once the monster approaches you (don’t worry, it moves really slowly), quickly take a step back away from its range. If you get too close to it, a Like Like will spring towards you and suck you inside its body. You’ll stay inside it for a second or two until it regurgitates you out, dealing damage and stripping you off of your shield or tunic (if you have any)., Draw out your sword and take a slash at the monster. It doesn’t have any defensive move so your strike will directly hit it without effort. It takes around two or three blows of your sword before the monster can be killed., If the Like Like did manage to devour you, the shield or tunic it stole from you will drop to the ground once you defeat it. Walk towards the items it dropped to take back your precious items.

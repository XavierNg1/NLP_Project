 The intro video will show you a preview of what to do and how you are supposed to fly upside-down. When you have control, you will be on the runway. Perform a take-off and climb to reach the first marker., Shortly after you reach the marker, a roll meter will appear. Start rolling immediately when it does, by fully turning your left analog stick to the left or to the right until you complete a 360 barrel roll. Then level your plane. The quicker you level your aircraft, the faster the next roll meter will appear.,, Once done, quickly level up again. You will now be asked to fly upside down. Roll upside down – you’ll notice your plane is dipping towards terra firma, so what you need to do is press your left analog stick up.

Yes, up. This is because when you are upside down the Y-axis is reversed. Keep yourself in that position till the meter fills red, while gently holding the left analog stick up to prevent yourself from dipping and losing altitude quickly.

 If the dandruff flakes are thin, translucent, and found only on the hair but not the scalp, they are likely a reaction to hair styling products. Look to see if your hair products contain Paraphenylenediamine, an ingredient that often causes dandruff issues. Also look for products with alcohol and harsh chemicals use in hair dye. These issues can also be caused by using too many products with separate ingredients.This type of scalp issue can be treated by eliminating or switching hair styling products and washing your hair more frequently.If you aren't sure which one is causing the issue, eliminate one at a time until you find the culprit.
 Seborrheic dermatitis, which is a condition that causes irritated, oily scalp skin, can be made worse by the oils from your hair and pores. Frequent shampooing will help to remove irritants and keep your scalp free of dandruff buildup.


Even a quick shampoo and rinse before going out can do wonders for your dandruff.
 Exposing your scalp to moderate doses of sunlight may be helpful. The ultraviolet rays may be helpful in reducing the amount of flakes in your skin. However, increased exposure to the sun is harmful for your skin, so don't lay out in the sun or stay out in the sun for too long. Instead, apply sunscreen before you go out and just spend a little time getting some sun on your scalp., If you are not satisfied with the level of dandruff you have after a few weeks of self-treatment, consult a doctor. Dandruff rarely causes physical problems, but if you would like to get rid of it for personal reasons, a doctor may prescribe stronger medication. He or she may also recommend additional steroid treatment to reduce inflammation and itching as well.


For severe cases, isotretinoin may be prescribed, but as this can have severe side effects, it is only recommended as a last resort.

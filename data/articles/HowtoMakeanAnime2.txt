 You should try to decide what they look like at the same time that you decide their personalities. Try drawing the characters and then jotting down beside them what their personality traits would be. Maybe you have one character that is really intelligent and perceptive but prone to losing their temper. Maybe you have another character that is very loyal but very unkind to strangers. Sketch drafts of your characters. The way the characters look is important because it can play into their personality. For example, maybe the very muscular character is the hero. Conversely, maybe the very muscular character is a total coward. Either way, his body informs his personality in an interesting way.
 You don’t need to have just one main character, but it’s nice to give the reader somebody to rout for. Most anime have a protagonist. , Anime often feature characters with special abilities accomplishing extraordinary things. It might be a good idea to give your main character some sort of power that will help him or her deal with whatever the problem in your anime is going to be. Your character doesn’t have to be able to fly or have super strength – find something small and interesting that helps the character deal with unique challenges. For example, maybe your character is incredibly brave! That’s a special ability, but it isn’t magic.
 Family members, love interests and friends of your protagonist should all play a major role in your story. These are the strongest connections that people have with others and they help motivate, inspire, and create conflict. All of those things are positive attributes in a fun story.
 The other characters can play into your characters motivation, but find a unique thing that drives them. It can be getting educated or getting the girl, it just has to be something that the protagonist is very passionate about.

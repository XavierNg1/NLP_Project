 Place it on the floor, butted up to the side of the desk. Pre-drill two holes and place a couple of deck screws through the scrap piece, into the floor. This provides a 'hard stop' for the desk on one side.;
, Lift the desk end, by pushing on the side of the desk opposite where the floor cleat is, holding the desk from sliding.
 Carefully glide the square dolly under the lifted end of the desk. The dolly has carpet fabric attached to it, so it provides a 'grip' on the heavy desk.
 Place the other dolly right next to the desk. Using a wide stance, lift the side of the desk up. It lifts much easier than the first side because the other end is already up on the dolly. You can now walk the desk over the other dolly, if the dolly at the other end has rotating caster wheels.

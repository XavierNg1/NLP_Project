, Select New Folder and create a new folder. Create folders for different years: 2005, 2006, 2007, etc.






Obviously, if you don't have pictures from that far back, you won't need to create the folders.
, For example, 07 could have Fireworks, Picnic, Vacation. 12 might have Christmas, Dinner, Seasonal Party, etc.






If you don't have events, put names of the types of photos, such as: Pets, Flowers, etc.
 The chances are pretty good that you will, because most people generally take the same type of pictures.
, There will be times when you will have files with duplicate names. FastStone gives you the option of 'skipping' the file and then you can go back and rename it.
 To select contiguous files (all the files are clustered together), you can hold down SHIFT and click on the first and the last image. To select non-contiguous files, hold down CTRL and click on the various images that you want to move. This screenshot shows contiguous files selected.
 That way, you won't be looking in them again for images.
 Another useful one is a folder for your RAW images, if you happen to have RAW and JPG files of the same picture.

 If you are looking to build lower body strength, an incline running plan can help you build up your glutes, hips, and leg muscles. Start with a gradually increasing incline plan, such as:1 mile (1.6 km) with no incline
0.75 mile (1.2 km) at two percent
Half a mile (0.8 km) at three perecent
0.25 mile (0.4 km) at four percent
Half a mile (0.8 km) at three perecent
0.75 mile (1.2 km) at two percent
1 (1.6 km) mile with no incline

, As you feel more comfortable with your incline workout, start building endurance by increasing your inclines. As you find your workouts are less challenging, generally every week to two weeks, increase the incline on each interval by one percent.Your workouts should raise your heartrate but not cause you so much strain that it’s difficult to breathe or that your muscles lock up. If you find a workout is too intense, dial it down.
 Create variation and mimic the impact of running hills by varying your incline and speed. Go from high inclines to relatively flat ones and then back to greater inclines, and adjust your speed as necessary to keep your heartrate up. Some treadmills have a built in function for such a workout, but if you’re planning one on your own, you could try:Half a mile (0.8 km) at nine percent
0.75 (1.2 km) mile at four percent
A mile (1.6 km) at eleven percent
Half a mile (0.8 km) at fifteen percent
0.25 (0.4 km) mile at two percent

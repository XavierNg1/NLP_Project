 Put a little powder (flour, powdered sugar, etc.) in one of the covers or on the page you think might be most likely read. The powder will fall out when the page is opened, and you will notice either powder on the floor near your diary, or that the powder in the book is missing.
 Write a false entry in your diary saying that if your brother does your chores for you every day for a week, you will give him a piece of candy. Or say that if your sister cleans your room you will let her borrow your laptop, for example. When your brother miraculously starts doing your chores or your room is suddenly spotless (and your sister claims it to be her work), you know you've got readers.
 Find one of your hairs on your jacket or shower or something. Place one end of the hair in one of the covers of your diary and the other end in the other cover of the diary so the hair is facing the side of the book that opens. When someone opens the diary, the hair will snap or will fall out or loosen a lot.

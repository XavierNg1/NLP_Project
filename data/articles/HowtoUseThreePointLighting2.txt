 The fill light's role is to soften or eliminate the sharp shadows created through the use of the key light alone - for instance, the shadow cast by a person's nose onto their cheek. For this reason, the fill light should be positioned at around a 45 degree angle to the key light. If the key light is just to the left of your camera, then consider setting up the fill light just to the right.
 If you have the equipment, you can of course use an electric lamp as the fill light. However, for a softer, more diffused, and less expensive method, you can easily use a reflective piece of material as a fill light. White foam board can be used to reflect ambient light and key lighting for use as fill lighting, while aluminum-backed umbrella-style reflectors will reflect a bit more light than foam board.
 The fill light should not be strong enough to create a second set of shadows - its role is only to diffuse the shadows created by the key light. If you have 2 conflicting sets of shadows in your image, reduce the intensity of your fill light.

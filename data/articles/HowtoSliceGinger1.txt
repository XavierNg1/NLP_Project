 When you purchase raw ginger, it will look like a knobby root with a few sections that can be broken off. Hold the ginger in both hands and use pressure to break off one of the lobes. This can make working with the ginger a bit easier., Hold the ginger in one hand and the knife firmly in your dominant hand. Slowly and carefully cut the surface of ginger, removing the top layer of the ginger, thus removing the skin.


Peeling is often done for the aesthetics. Leaving the skin on can enhance the flavor of the ginger., Holding the vegetable peeler in one hand and the ginger in the other, begin scraping the skin off the ginger. The skin of the ginger root is thin, flaky, and almost translucent, so it should come off easily. The most difficult part of this process is navigating the rough, uneven surface of the ginger, which can be a bit more troublesome using a vegetable peeler.
 Hold the ginger firmly in one hand and a spoon in your dominant hand. With the convex side of spoon facing toward you, scrape the edge of it against the ginger, peeling off the skin. Peel only as much as you think you will use. Store the rest.

 As you may imagine, winter is an extreme event both in and around Antarctica, so don’t expect cruise lines to operate at this time of year. If you’re from the Northern Hemisphere, remember that seasons in the Southern Hemisphere occur at the opposite time of year. Plan your vacation for sometime between October and March., Remember that the closer you go toward either pole (in this case, the South Pole), the longer the days last around the summer solstice. To optimize the most amount of daylight available for sightseeing, go in December and/or January, when days last their longest. Depending on the cruise operators, this may also extend the amount of time you get to spend on shore each day before returning to the ship., Again, consider the amount of daylight available to determine when is the best time to go and beat the colder weather. Plan for December and January to enjoy the mildest conditions. Expect more severe changes in weather the earlier or later you go in the season, when nightfall occurs earlier., If you’re going specifically to see your favorite Antarctic animal in the wild, find out the best time of year to see them and synchronize your trip. For example, if you love fur seals, go in December, when they start crowding the beaches. If, on the other hand, you prefer bull elephant seals, go earlier, before the fur seals overcrowd them and force them out.

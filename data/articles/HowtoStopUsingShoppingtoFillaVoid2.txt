 Shopaholics often make shopping a central social activity to do with friends and family. You may find yourself shopping to celebrate a big promotion or after a bad day. Find others way to cope. Go out to eat with friends,to a movie, or a museum. You will still have the comfort of social connections without relying on shopping. Don't let shopping be a reward or a way to deal with bad days. If you have a bad day, call a friend, partner, or family member and let them help you cheer up. If you have some extra money to celebrate, put the money away and rejoice in the good feeling when all that savings adds up.
 A hobby is something that should fulfill you and make you feel satisfied. Shopping offers little long term fulfillment. It is also harder to match that feeling each time, so you feel compelled to buy more. What sort of hobby leaves you feeling so compelled and tied up? Unless your shopping habit is truly giving you a long-term sense of satisfaction and enrichment, it's not a hobby.



Find a real hobby and substitute that for the shopping hobby. Try substituting physical activities or something that gives you a rush instead of shopping.
 You are much more likely to do impulsive, emotion based shopping if it's available to you. Create off-limit zones that may trigger your desire to shop, such as malls, shopping areas, and other stores. Don't allow any ambiguity, such as a grocery store within your forbidden zone, to help reduce lapses.This should apply to your internet life, too. Don't go to shopping websites, even if it's just to look, and unsubscribe to e-mails from your favorite stores and companies.
 Accountability and transparency are key to breaking a shopping habit. Take someone, a shopping support buddy, with you when you shop. They can help keep you on task and prevent any binge purchases.Even if you're alone, texting or calling a friend while shopping, can be useful. You can tell them what you're purchasing and they can offer an outside perspective.

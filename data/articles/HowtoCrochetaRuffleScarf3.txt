 You will need to use a special kind of yarn to make a ruffle scarf. This yarn is called sashay yarn and it looks like a long strip of mesh when you unfurl it. Choose a sashay yarn in the color of your choice.

You can use another type of yarn that is designed to create ruffles as well. For example, you could try using a ribbon yarn or a chiffon yarn., You will also need to use a crochet hook that is appropriate for your sashay yarn. Check the yarn label to see what size hook is recommended.

A size J-10 (6mm) or K-10 (6.5mm) hook should work well for this project., Sashay yarn can be a little tricky to work with because of all of the loops. Placing stitch markers to indicate where you started working and where each of your rows begins and ends can help to make working with this yarn a little easier.

 Nepali shares its script with Hindi, but not the gender specific words. Saying "म तिमीलाई माया गर्छु" works for both males and females. It is pronounced as "ma timi-lai maya gar-choo"
, This is another way of saying it and is pronounced "timi-lai prem gar-choo." It is much less direct, as its equivalent in English would be something along the lines of "love ya!", To say it back to someone, just say "म पनि तिमीलाई माया गर्छु।" which is pronounced "ma pa-ni timi-lai maya gar-choo." It is the same as "I love you" but it has the word "पनि" (pa-ni) added to it, which means "too", hence the sentence translates into "I love you too."

If you want to let your partner know that you think you love them more, just say "म तिमीलाई धेरै माया गर्छू।" which means, "I love you more", and is pronounced "ma timi-lai dhe-rai maya gar-choo."

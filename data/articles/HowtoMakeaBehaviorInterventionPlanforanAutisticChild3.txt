 A predictable routine can feel safe to autistic children. It can be especially helpful to make a visual schedule, so that they can see exactly what is going to happen.Try cards that can be rearranged, or a dry-erase board, to account for changes in routine.


Pictures can also help support the child's memory, because some autistic children may have difficulty remembering important things.For example, if they have a picture of homework on days when they have homework, it can help them remember.
 Sensory needs can interfere with self-control and other abilities,so keep them on a healthy sensory diet. Provide a calming, low-input environment for hypersensitivity, and have activities prepared for sensory seekers.
 Because autistic children struggle with self-regulation, having a quiet space where they can retreat can help them balance themselves when they are overwhelmed or moody. Encourage the child to use it whenever they need to.


Place stim toys and ways to block sensory input in the corner. Divide it from the rest of the room with a curtain, shelf, or other barrier.
Leave the child alone when they are using the corner., Just as autistic people work hard to accommodate non-autistics, non-autistic people need to be helpful and understanding towards autistic people. If a behavior is not harming anyone, then non-autistic people need to learn to accept it.Don't micromanage.
 Autistic children are at risk for anxiety, and may need anxiety medication or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to keep it under control. Managing any anxiety disorders can help the child be healthier and happier.
 Maintaining a good relationship with the child is important for both people's well-being.Do fun things together, talk to them, and take time to listen carefully to what they have to say (whether it's verbal or not).

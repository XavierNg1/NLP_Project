Disposable wipes are more sanitary and convenient, but reusable wipes are more economical and environmentally friendly. Some babies have allergic reactions to disposable infant wipes, making reusable products the only option.
Buy reusable baby wipes at most organic baby boutiques, or cut squares of organic cotton or flannel fabric.
Reusable wipes or cotton balls are recommended in the first weeks of the infant's life, since the skin is very sensitive immediately following birth.;

Hypoallergenic wipes may be an option if your child cannot tolerate traditional disposable wipes.

Wipes are usually sold in reusable tubs, zipper bags or travel packs with or without lids. If the wipes you want aren't available in your preferred packaging you can transfer them to your own zipper bag, travel case or recycled wipes tub. Packaging may be decorated with colorful designs or characters, so your purchase decision may be influenced by how the wipes will look in your baby's nursery.



If a brand is new to you, purchase a trial packet or a small tub of about 60 wipes. If you know the brand works well for your child, purchase a large pack of about 200 wipes. Some stores carry large value boxes that may contain up to 1,000 wipes. A large quantity is not necessarily the best value, so if you are looking for cost savings, calculate and compare prices per wipe.

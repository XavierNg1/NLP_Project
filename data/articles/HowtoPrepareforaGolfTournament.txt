 Walk it, view it and perhaps even play it ahead of time. Getting to know it is invaluable.;
, Google Earth shots might also be helpful.
 Print out a scorecard from online. If possible, play a game there. Ask friends who have played the course or ask people who work at the course about major hazards, tricks, yard markers, and green speed.
 If you are a member at any particular course that has a driving range and a putting green, then that is perfect. If not, then go to a local driving range.
 When you reach the range make sure you grab 2 clubs and start loosening up your muscles take about 5-6 swings. You also need to stretch your major "golfing" muscles.


Generally at a junior tournament, if the host club has a range, the club will give you around 30-50 balls (depending on size) for your warm-up routine.
 You do not need to be playing target golf for your first two shots.
 Since you don't have many golf balls, use the irons that you play your best with. This will boost your confidence when on the range.
 When you have two golf balls left, figure out what you are going to hit on the first tee and go through your routine.
 While on your local club's range, make every shot count.
 Make sure you are well rested. Instead, go out on the range for an hour every day the week before a tournament, not cramming in 5 hours of practice the day before.
 A big thing in golf is mental toughness. It is not all about having the nicest and best equipment. And do not believe all the scores people say they shoot; until the end of the round, most are there to intimidate you.
 Enjoying yourself is the most important.

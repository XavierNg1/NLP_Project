 Microsoft Publisher graphic images can be positioned either of 2 ways, inline or exact. The type of positioning you want depends on how you will use the graphic.


Inline graphics are treated as part of the text block they accompany and will move as you type, remove, or replace the text in that block. Inline graphics are best suited for charts, graphs, and example photographs and drawings that illustrate the points made in the text adjacent to them.
Exact position graphics are placed in a specific location on the page and do not move unless you specifically move them somewhere else. They are suited for such things as byline photos at the top of the first page and attention-grabbing images at the top, center, or bottom of a page. Microsoft Publisher uses exact positioning as its default setting for any graphic image you add to a publication.;

Choose "Inline" to make the graphic an inline graphic.
Choose "Exact" to make the graphic use exact positioning.
 The alignment options differ for inline and for exact position graphics, as described below.


The 3 radio button options under "Horizontal alignment" govern the position of an inline graphic relative to the adjacent text. Select "Left" to place the graphic to the left of the text, "Right" to place it to the right of the text, and "Move object with text" to let the graphic move when the text is edited.
The 4 boxes under "Position on page" govern the position of an exact positioned graphic on the page. The "Horizontal" and "Vertical" spin boxes specify the numeric distance and the "From" dropdown after each spin box determines whether that distance is from the top left corner, center, or top right corner.
 The graphic is now of the type and in the position you specified.

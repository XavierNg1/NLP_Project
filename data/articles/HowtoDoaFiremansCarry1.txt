 If a traumatic accident has taken place and you think the victim has injured their spine, then do not move them unless it's absolutely necessary to evade an urgent danger, such as a flood.


If you absolutely do need to move a victim that might have injured their spine, then you'll need to drag them instead of carrying them over your shoulder to minimize the chances of spinal damage.;
, If the victim is on their back, roll them over on their stomach so they'll be easier to lift. To do this, just place one arm on the victim's shoulder and one arm on the same side of their body and push or pull them on to their stomach.


If there is time and the person is not breathing, you may need to perform CPR.

,,, IfÂ you want to use it as a gift or to save it in the refrigerator, pour it into a jar and close the lid tightly.


If you want to drink it cold, pour some cold water or ice cubes into the drink and enjoy the refreshing result.
If you want it hot, pour some hot water into the drink; this part is optional but if you like it to be tastier then you can add some pine nuts.
 If the drink itself is too spicy or not sweet enough, add some more honey and you can also try adding some lime or lemon drops. It also makes it tastier!

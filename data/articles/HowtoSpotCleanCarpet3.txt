 Just as you would with other stains, blot up the majority of the stain with a clean, white cloth. Rinse the stain with water and blot it some more. This process will get the majority of the stain up before you do anything else.
 Pour some vinegar into a spray bottle, or stick a spray nozzle directly into the vinegar bottle. If you don’t have a spray bottle, pour the vinegar directly from the bottle onto the stain. Use enough vinegar to cover the stain, but don’t saturate the carpet.Before you use vinegar on a visible spot on your carpet, test it on an hidden spot to check the colorfastness of the carpet. Vinegar will occasionally discolor carpet.
 Take the container of baking soda and use a spoon to scoop the powder out, or dump the baking soda directly from the container. Use enough to fully cover the area of the stain.Don’t be afraid to let the baking soda pile up a little bit, as it won’t hurt anything to use more than you need.
This vinegar and baking soda mix is effective on dried stains as well as fresh stains. It also works especially well for pet urine stains.
 Especially for tough stains like pet urine, let the mixture sit on the carpet for a day or two. This gives the vinegar and baking soda plenty of time to absorb the stain and any resulting smell. If you’re in a hurry, clean it up sooner, but know that it may be less effective.


Let it sit for a minimum of one hour so it has enough time to work.
 While the mixture sits for a couple of days, it presents an obstacle for anyone walking in your house. To avoid tracking baking soda all over the house, place a plate or bowl over the stain to keep people from walking on the spot.Another option is to place a chair or footstool over the spot to force people to walk around it.
 After you have allowed the mixture to sit a while and absorb the stain, use a vacuum cleaner to suck up the mess. It may require a few good passes to pull it all up out of the carpet fibers.

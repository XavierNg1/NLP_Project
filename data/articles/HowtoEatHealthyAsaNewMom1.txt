 You may feel any sense of routine you had is gone once you bring home a baby. It can be difficult to even remember to sit down and eat when you've been up caring for the baby. Remind yourself that you need to be eating regular meals throughout the day. This will give you steady energy. Eating regular meals will also stop you from making poor food decisions on an empty stomach.If you need to, set an alarm on your phone that reminds you when it's time to eat a meal.
If you have help, have someone care for the baby while you sit down for a meal.;
, Friends and family members often want to help when a new baby comes. A great way they can help is to bring you meals. There are several meal sharing applications or programs, so your friends and family can organize which date and when they want to drop off food. Just let them know that you'd prefer healthy food.


For example, don't be afraid to request no junk food, cookies, or fried foods. Many apps also have a place for you to list any dietary restrictions.
 Since you'll be up throughout the night and be busy caring for your baby during the day, you'll probably find that you're hungrier than usual. This is especially true if you're breastfeeding. Try to have nutritious snacks that you can eat with one hand. If you can, portion them into serving sizes. Some good examples of snacks include:Cut fresh fruit with a yogurt dip
Granola bars
Hard boiled eggs
Cut vegetables and hummus or bean dip

, Talk with your doctor about a reasonable calorie-intake during the postpartum period. One of the perks of breastfeeding is that you'll actually need about 500 more calories a day, so your body can produce milk (for a total of 2200 to 2400 calories a day). If you're not breastfeeding, you'll probably need to get between 1900 and 2200 calories a day.Avoid cutting too many calories in the early postpartum period, since your body needs a chance to recover from childbirth.

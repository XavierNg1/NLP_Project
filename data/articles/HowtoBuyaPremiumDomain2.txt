 If you cannot effectively reach the owner of the domain, you will not have the opportunity to buy the domain from them.


Use the contact information published on the domain to contact the owner. In some cases, you may need to review the cached versions of certain web pages to locate contact information.
Click on a link within your domain that reads similarly to "this domain may be for sale." In most cases, these links will redirect you to the contact information for the owner of the website.
Use the "who is" directory to find contact information for a domain or to send a private message to the domain owner. A "who is" directory can be found on the "Domain Tools" website, the link to which is featured on the "Four Hour Workweek" website listed in this article's Sources section.
 This will allow you to confirm whether buying the domain is an option.


Refrain from giving the domain owner your personal information when you inquire whether or not the domain is for sale. If the owner has your personal information, they may research your background to see how much you are worth. For example, if you own a highly profitable business, the domain owner may charge you more than they may charge others for the domain.
Create an email address using an alias if you need to contact the domain owner by email.
 If the owner is selling the domain, they may have a certain price range established for which they will sell their premium domain.


Use verbiage that allows for flexibility from a legal standpoint when negotiating the price of the domain in writing. For example, if you communicate in writing that you will buy the domain for 20,000 dollars (15,819 euros), you may be bound to that sale price by contract and may not have the ability to negotiate for a lower sale price.

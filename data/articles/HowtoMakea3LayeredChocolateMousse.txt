, Separate egg whites in 3 different glass bowls and mix in all the egg yolks together in another bowl. Stir in the cornstarch and sugar with the egg yolks and keep aside., Place another bowl filled with water on high heat and let it come to a boil. Meanwhile, gradually pour the egg yolk mixture into the milk and keep stirring with a whisk. When the milk and yolks has combined well, remove the bowl from the heat and place it in the hot water bowl such that the base of the bowl touches the boiling water. Keep stirring until the mixture thickens. Remove and let cool., Place the bowl in hot water and keep stirring till it dissolves completely. You can also use a microwave, just microwave for 4 to 5 seconds on low. Mix the dissolved gelatin into the milk-yolk custard and keep aside., Now divide this custard-cream mixture into 3 portions., You can use a large bowl with water which can accommodate all the 3 chocolate bowls or cups and melt them simultaneously, remember to use 3 different spoons to stir.

First stir in the melted dark chocolate into one portion of the custard-cream mixture. Beat 1 egg white until stiff and fold it into the dark chocolate-custard-cream mixture. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and smooth on top. Place the pan in the refrigerator.
Meanwhile, mix the melted white chocolate with the second portion of custard-cream mixture. Beat the second egg white until stiff and fold it into the white chocolate-custard-cream mixture. Pour this on the first layer of mousse and smooth on top. Transfer it back to the refrigerator.

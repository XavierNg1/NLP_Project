 Lantana benefits from being pruned in the mid-springtime before growth begins. This will improve flowering later in the season.


Avoid pruning in the fall.
 Remove any branches that are crowded or grow over other branches. Cut back the Lantana by about a third of the size of the plant.


Give the plant a liquid feed after pruning.
 During the growing season you should lightly prune your Lantana, as this will encourage new flowering. Take about two inches off each growing tip with a sharp pair of garden scissors. This should encourage new growth.


Itâ€™s always a good idea to feed the plant after pruning.

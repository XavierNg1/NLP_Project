 If you find out that you’re out of dishwashing detergent when the dishwasher’s already full, start by adding three or four drops of regular dishwashing soap to the dishwasher’s detergent cup. Any brand or type of dish soap will work as long as it’s a liquid.If you’re cleaning a particularly dirty load of dishes, you may want to bump the soap up to four or five drops.;
, After you’ve placed the dish soap in the washer’s detergent cup, add baking soda. You’ll want to pour enough baking soda into the detergent cup to fill it up approximately ⅔ full.To avoid spilling baking soda all over the interior of the dishwasher, use a spoon to carefully fill the detergent cup rather than pouring the baking soda straight from the box.
 Once the dish soap and baking soda are in the detergent cup, reach for a container of regular table salt. Add enough salt to the dish soap and baking soda mixture to completely fill the detergent cup.If you only have sea or kosher salt, you can substitute either for the table salt.
 When you’ve completely filled the detergent cup with the mixture, close the compartment. Set and run your dishwasher as you usually do, and when the cycle is done, you’ll have clean, sparkling dishes without any suds overflow.Not only is this dishwasher detergent easy to make, it’s cheaper than store-bought versions. Most people usually have dish soap, baking soda, and salt in their kitchen, so it’s a convenient alternative to the usual dishwasher detergent.

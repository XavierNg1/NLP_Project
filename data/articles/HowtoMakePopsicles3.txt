, Use chopsticks, skewers, etc.
 Push the stick through and rest almost at the base of the container but not quite. Repeat for each container until all six have sticks poking out of them.
 Leave to freeze overnight.
 Whenever you want a popsicle, simply snap off one container, peel off the lid and hold by the stick. Enjoy!


Keep the container to catch drips or to hold the large popsicle when you need a rest between licks.

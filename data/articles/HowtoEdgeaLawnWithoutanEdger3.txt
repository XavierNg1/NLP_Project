 Mark out where you want your bed to go using string on pegs (this is best for square or oblong beds), chalk, or a spray can of paint.
 Put the blade into the ground along the marked line and put your foot on it, holding the handle firmly. Push down with your foot to cut through the soil. Try rocking gently to cut through the turf.


Push the handle forward and back slightly to loosen the cut edge away from the rest of the turf. It’s helpful to prise the cut area open slightly so you can see where you’ve worked.
Now move the spade’s blade a few inches to the side and cut the next piece away. Continue until you have edged around the entire line.
 Once you've cut and made visible one full line of the bed’s edge, return to the start of your turf cut. Now you want to make another cut about one inch inside the area of the new bed.


Make the second cut at a slight angle towards the first cut you made. The idea is to make a thin strip of turf for easy removal.
 Once you have cut the whole length, get down on your knees. If you’ve made a severing cut through the turf, you should be able to pull up the long one inch wide strip of turf easily.


Now take the spade and remove the remaining turf from inside the new bed area.
You’ll need to dig over and improve the soil ahead of planting.

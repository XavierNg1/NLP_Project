 While spray pesticides kill spiders fast, they are harmful to humans, pets and plants. Sticky traps have a sticky material coating on one surface. They are placed wherever spiders tend to move in search of prey; the glue traps the spiders when they walk across the trap. Buy glue traps or make your own:


Fold a piece of cardboard into a triangular shape—about 4” long and 3” high.
Brush on a sticky coating on the inside of the bottom piece of the trap. You can use glue or you can buy a commercial product at a nursery or home and garden store.
Sweeten the trap by adding a bit of honey or peanut butter to the glue. This isn’t strictly necessary, but a little scent might help attract the spiders more quickly.
Discard the trap when it is filled with dead spiders or other insects.;

Make sure you use the current tax year's form.
Understand you need to fill out one Form 8824 for each exchange you make.;
, The instructions provided walk you through the process, step by step.


Start with the type of item you gave up as requested in Part I, Line 1.






Proceed to Line 2 in answering the remainder of the questions beginning with the article you received in return.






Lines 3 through 6 explain the history of the exchange. Fill out each one with the appropriate date-related information.






The next few questions are in Part II and pertain to any related party who might have been involved in the transaction.






Part III considers the actual financial value of the transaction. Lines 12 through 14 need only be completed if your transaction was not actually a "like-kind" exchange. Otherwise, go to Line 15. You most likely will not have any taxes to pay and provide this information for knowledge purposes.






Part IV deals with any possible "conflict of interest" issues you may incur. It will only pertain to instances where a higher replacement value takes place after noting the original item's value. This is particularly important for people in any job of power (government or otherwise) to consider.
 Do not embellish it in any way.
, Further tax form needs could easily include minimized gains on exchanged property. For this, you should ask the accountant about Form 1031.

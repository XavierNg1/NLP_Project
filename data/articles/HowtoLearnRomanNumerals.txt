 Here's what you need to know to get started:I = 1
V = 5
X = 10
L = 50
C = 100
D = 500
M = 1000;
, If you have a hard time remembering what goes where, just try this simple one: My Dear Cat Loves Xtra Vitamins Intensely.
 Here they are:


I = 1
II = 2
III = 3
IV = 4
V = 5
VI = 6
VII = 7
VIII = 8
IX = 9

, Here they are:


X = 10
XX = 20
XXX = 30
XL = 40
L = 50
LX = 60
LXX = 70
LXXX = 80
XC = 90

, Here they are:


C = 100
CC = 200
CCC = 300
CD = 400
D = 500
DC = 600
DCC = 700
DCCC = 800
CM = 900

, When you place the same symbols together, you can just add their values. Normally the maximum number of the consecutive same symbols is three.


II = 2
XXX = 30

, Similar to the above rule, just add their values together. Remember the numeral must have the larger symbol value first for this to work. Here's how you do it:


XI = 11
MCL = 1150

, In this case, you need to subtract the smaller value from the larger value. Here's how you do it:


IV = 4
CM = 900

, There are numerous rules that govern the way Roman numerals are supposed to look. Here are some rules to know:


IV should be used rather than IIII
2987 is written as MMCMLXXXVII because:

The first M gives you 1000
The next M gives you 1000
The next CM gives you 900
The next LXXX gives you 80
The next VII gives you 7
Therefore if you add the amounts together, you will get 2987.
 Since M = 1,000, if you want to represent one million, a bar, or line, is added above the numeral M, equaling one million. The bar above the numeral represents that figure times one thousand. Thus, M x M= 1,000,000.


Five million would be represented by MMMMM with a bar above each M. This procedure is necessary because in Roman numerals, there is no larger symbol than M (1,000). This method isn't commonly used, but it's good to know how it works.

 You may also observe the gerbil pounding both rear feet. The sound is usually a quick thump, but can vary in tempo and volume. This can be mistaken for the gerbil being excited for reasons other than mating.Sometimes gerbils other than the mating pair will “catch on” and start pounding their feet too.;
, This is scent marking, and may be a sign of the male signaling his suitability as a mate to the female gerbil. You may also see the gerbil rubbing their stomach on cage objects.The male gerbil, however, could also be doing this to establish dominance and/or mark territory.
 The male may be reacting to the female’s readiness to mate. The first sign of aggressive behavior is usually a loud squeak from the male. The male gerbils may appear to “box” or wrestle with other males to ward off rivals for mating. Do not let this go on too long. Separate them if necessary.The aggressive behavior could also be for a perceived threat unrelated to mating.

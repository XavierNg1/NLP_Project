 Fresh tomatoes should have taught, shiny skin with a uniform red color. The skin should give a little when squeezed, but not feel mushy.
 The stem and leaves of the tomato should be green and should be tightly attached to the tomato. Brownish, loose leaves or stems indicate that the tomato has been sitting for a few days. The tomato shouldn't have any shriveled or soft spots.



Tomatoes in the middle or near the bottom could be bruised by the weight of the tomatoes on top of them and are probably older and less fresh than the tomatoes above.

 It is almost impossible to work with the animal, get the pose you want, get back to the camera and get the shot...after checking the focus.;
, If you can't go outside, then try using a well lit room, or a patio door with a lot of light coming in from the outside. It is less hot than strobe lights and is less location-dependent.
 If the rest of the image is blurry, but the eyes are sharp, this makes the rest of the image seem acceptable to the viewer's eyes. This can be important in both pet and people photography.
 It makes for a more natural looking picture. Your pet will also be more comfortable if you aren't looming over them when taking the photo.
 If your cat is lazy, get her by the window resting in the light. If he is active, show him in mid leap.
 Don't have your scene show a dog in it - then you don't know what the shot is. Get close up and zoom in.
 Whistle or snap and they will be surprised and concentrate on the movement or noise.
 If you want a more lively shot, shoot them when they are more alert. Pets tend to be alert near dinnertime and more relaxed after their meal.
 It takes a lot of trial and error to get that winning shot.
 Like people, some animals are photogenic and some aren't. Try adjusting the viewpoint, or go for a silhouette. After all, the reaches of photography are limitless!

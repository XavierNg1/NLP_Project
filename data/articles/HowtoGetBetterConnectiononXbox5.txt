 You can check your speed at Speedtest.net or any other site that comes up from searching “internet speed test” in any search engine. These websites are fairly straightforward, but if you need additional help, checking your internet speed, try our article.
 Write down the following: Download speed, upload speed, ping.
 You’ll need a download speed of at least 3 megabits per second, an upload speed of at least 0.5 megabits per second, and a ping of less than 150 milliseconds. This is the minimum requirements to have a “certified” experience, so higher connection speeds will lead to an even better connection. If your connection is less than this, you’ll have to upgrade.
 If all else fails, you may have a problem with your connection, or may need to up the speed.

 Try not to oversaturate the pad, or the solution may drip on your face. Apply enough makeup remover so that the pad is just saturated.Don't use a cotton ball, as the fibers can detach and get in your eyes.If you're not sure how your skin will react to your makeup remover (whether it's coconut oil or from the drugstore), test some on your inner wrist. If you have a reaction it's better to have an inflamed wrist than an inflamed eye.
 Don't scrub or tug on your skin, just press the pad against your lashes so the remover can begin to break down the makeup., Then turn the pad over to the makeup-free side and wipe your eye with an upward motion.You can wiggle the pad a little by your lash line to help break up more stubborn mascara.Use cotton swab dipped in makeup remover to clean up any remaining mascara, like little flecks or smears that end up under your lower lashes., Removing your makeup is not the final step in your nightly skincare routine--it's the first. Getting all the makeup off your face allows the your cleanser to get into your pores, instead of mixing with makeup and clogging them.Find a cleanser that is right for your skin type and gently massage it into your face. Use warm water and a facial cloth or sponge to wipe off the dirt and grime.Washing your face also removes any remnants of your makeup remover which, if it remains on your skin, can cause dryness or even an allergic reaction., You'll pull your eyelashes out, too. It takes 1-2 months for your lashes to grow back,and since you're probably using mascara to make your lashes look thicker or longer, it seems sort of pointless if you're just yanking them out.
 If it happens once or twice, it shouldn't be a huge deal. But if you frequently fall asleep without removing your makeup, you risk clogging your hair follicles and developing a stye or eye infection.Where a clean, makeup-free lash would bend, a brittle lash, dried out by mascara, can get bent by your pillowcase and scratch your eye.

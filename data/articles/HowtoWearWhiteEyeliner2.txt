 Draw white liner at your upper lash line. Use an eyeshadow brush or applicator to smudge the liner across your whole upper lid. Line your upper lash line with white again. Flick the corners out into cat eyes, or use tape as a guide to draw the outer edges, tapering off towards the tips. Finish the look with dark mascara to your upper lashes.Try touching the sticky side of clear tape with your finger first, so that it isnâ€™t too sticky.For an even more striking look, line your upper lash line the second time with liquid white eyeliner.
 Instead of black or brown liner, draw white liner thickly on your upper lids, beginning as close to the lash line as possible. Top off this dramatic style with mascara to your upper and/or lower lids, if desired., Line your upper lids with white, twice as thick as you typically would apply your liner. Draw another shade of eyeliner, such as black or brown, over half the thickness of the white.For stark contrast, you can also try the opposite: line your upper and lower waterline with black liner, then trace your lash lines with a shimmery white liner.If you want a costumey look, try drawing white eye liner in between two other shades, such as black (near the lash line) and blue (above the white).
 Apply the shadow to your top lids, and your bottom lids below the lash line. Blend the edges with a makeup brush or sponge. Then draw in your lower waterline with white eyeliner. Use clear mascara, if desired.

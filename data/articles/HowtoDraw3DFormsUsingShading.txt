 Make sure to give them an ellipse/oval shape for the opening. Use curved, straight and zigzag lines.
,, Start with the forms farthest from your light source to avoid dragging your hand through graphite. Make the shadows farthest from the light source very dark. Leave the highlights white.,

When shading the inside of the vessels (the ellipses), be sure to place the highlight on the side farthest from the light source, and the shadow closer to the light source (because the light hits the inside of the vase where the shadow would be on the outside).
 Line up the vessel with the light source using a ruler if you wish. This employs one-point perspective which helps create three-dimensionality., The cast shadow should be as wide as the vessel. Create a light value for the whole surface of the table: this creates contrast between the still-life scene and the background., Make finishing touches, and you're done!

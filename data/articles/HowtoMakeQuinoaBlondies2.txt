Add the chocolate chips., Spread the batter into the prepared 8x8 baking pan. Make sure to spread it evenly. Place the baking pan into the preheated oven and bake the blondies for 25 to 35 minutes.

Check on them around the 25 minute mark. Insert a toothpick into the center. When it comes out with only a few crumbs on it, the blondies are ready to be taken out.
 Once cooled, use the overhanging parchment paper (or foil) to help you lift the entire block of blondies out of the pan. Set onto a cutting board or other flat surface and cut them into about 24 equally sized squares.

Let the squares finish cooling the rest of the way before storing them in an airtight container.

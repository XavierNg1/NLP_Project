With this hand dragon, the index fingers and thumbs form the mouth.
 You want them bent at the knuckle where they meet the hand and pointing straight at you. Now, slightly twist your hands so that you can cross one ring finger over the other.The ring fingers will create the dragon’s eyeballs.
 Fold your left middle finger over your right ring finger. Fold your right middle finger over your left ring finger. Keep your pinkies sticking straight up.
 Bend your right index finger and bring it underneath your left ring finger so the tip of your ring finger rests on your index finger. Straighten your right index finger so it’s pointing straight at you. Repeat with the left index finger and right ring finger. Press the tips of your index fingers together.
 To move the mouth, move your thumb and fingers up and down while keeping your thumb tips together and your fingertips together.


At the moment, your pinkies are forming the horns or spikes of the dragon. To create a fire-breathing dragon, pull your pinky fingers inside the dragon’s mouth and criss-cross them so they can move around more easily.

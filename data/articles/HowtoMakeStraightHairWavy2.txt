 A homemade salt spray is easy to put together and you can use it to get the same kinds of waves that you have after a day at the beach.Put the following ingredients into a clean spray bottle:


1 cup of hot water
1-2 teaspoons of sea salt
1 tablespoon of coconut oil or argan oil (or you can use a half tablespoon of each)
Â½ teaspoon leave-in conditioner

, Mix well to ensure that the sea salt dissolves and the other ingredients are mixed well. This should only take about a minute of good shaking.
 Use your normal routine for washing your hair. Use a towel to soak up extra moisture out of your hair.
 Spray liberally all over your hair. Flip your hair upside down and get the underside of your hair as well.
 When your hair has been sprayed with the salt spray, use your hands to scrunch through all of your hair. Do this for a few minutes.
 Take all of your hair and braid it into one or two big braids. Let your hair dry.
 When your hair has fully dried, take out the braid. Give your hair a good shake and use your hands to scrunch through it some more.

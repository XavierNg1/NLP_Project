 A black cat, vampire, devil, model, mouse, Greek goddess and an angel are some starter ideas. You can try those, but be aware that some are very common and a bit boring. Other sexier costumes are referee, nurse, policewoman etc. Think of your style and what you like. Try to be original; if you're going to wear a common costume, add something to it that will make it unique.;
, Also, make sure the makeup goes with your costume; for example, if you're dressing up as a devil, you might want to wear red eye shadow and blush. You can also use nail polish if you'd like to.
 These are important depending on your costume. If you're going to be an angel, make sure you have the proper accessories a halo, the soft white dress, wings, etc. You could also wear a wig to look different.
 However, that does not mean that you need to around half naked if it makes you uncomfortable and just because it's Halloween. Dress appropriately for the occasion; you don't have to show skin to be sexy and it is not good for an office party.
 Yes, confidence is a big part of putting together and wearing a sexy Halloween costume. Imagine in your mind a shy and sad person walking around with their head down and their back slouched. Now imagine an outgoing and happy person strutting around with their head up and their shoulders thrown back. Which one sounds sexier to you?

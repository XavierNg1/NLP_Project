 This method will work best on shoes that are made completely out of canvas, such as Vans and Toms. If you have a pair of shoes that lace up or have a rubber toe cap, try this method instead. Here's a list of what you'll need:


Canvas sneakers
Bleach
Water
Plastic tub
Rubber gloves

, If your sneakers have inserts inside, you can pull those out and set them aside. This way, they will be their original color when you put them back in. This can create a nice contrast.
 You want to protect your hands from the bleach solution.
 For a stronger solution, use one part bleach and one part water. For a weaker solution, use one part bleach and two parts water.


The water-bleach solution needs to be deep enough so that you can submerge the shoes completely.
The plastic tub needs to be long enough so that you can sit your shoes inside.
 Try to set them upside down in the tub. This way, more of the fabric gets covered with bleach.
 This will take one to five hours, depending on how dark the shoes are to begin with, and how light you want them to become. Keep in mind that some of the darker colors will never fully turn white. Some colors, such as black, will turn orange or brown.


Be sure to check back on the shoes every 10 to 60 minutes.
 This will stop the bleach from acting. It will also get rid of the smell.
 It will take about three hours for them to fully dry.

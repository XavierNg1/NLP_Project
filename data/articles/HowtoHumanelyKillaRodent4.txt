 More powerful guns carry the risk of ricocheting or shooting through the rodent. They may also spread biological material further than smaller guns, causing a bigger mess and a greater health hazard. Low power air guns (12fpe), that are .177 calibre are considered the most appropriate., A rodent running free is very difficult to catch, but they are easier to corner. If they cornered, sitting still in a crevice, shooting it with an air-powered BB gun can be an effective and quick way to kill the rodent.This is only envisaged in an emergency situation. Most of the time setting traps in the normal way is preferable to shooting a rodent., If you do decide that shooting the rodent is a good option, ensure that the environment is safe. If the projectile passes through the rodent's head, it may hit people or objects in its path. Make sure the area is free of obstructions before firing.
 A shot to the head should kill the rodent instantly. If you miss the head, quickly reload and shoot the rodent in the head to end its suffering. You should only do this if you are confident that you can kill it quickly, otherwise it is far from humane.


Even a clean shot will be bloody and distressing.
 When mishandled, guns can be deadly. This is true for air guns too. An air rifle or pistol should never be aimed at another person.If you are unsure how to safely operate a gun, use another method to humanely kill the rodent.


You should familiarise yourself with local laws before thinking about shooting a rodent.

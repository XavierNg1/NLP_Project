 Most couples will be registered. Although registry lists are typically dominated by big ticket items, there will be a few smaller, reasonably priced options. Buy a few of the more inexpensive items on the registry. You can then package them together in a gift basket, or have them delivered directly to the coupleâ€™s house.By buying off the registry, you ensure that you are giving them something they actually want.
Smaller items on registries are often overlooked by most guests, so this is a great option when attending a wedding on a budget.
 If the couple enjoys wine, you could give them a personalized wine gift set that includes a bottle of wine to share on their honeymoon, a bottle for their 1st anniversary, and a bottle for their 10th anniversary. This gift speaks to the longevity of marriage and will make the couple think of you as they celebrate years of happiness together. You should be able to purchase three nice bottles of wine for around $100.Go to your local wine shop and purchase three bottles of wine.
Talk with the wine expert and ask them to recommend wine. Make sure that two of the bottles will taste better with age. Explain that you need one bottle that can be opened in 10 years and still taste amazing.
 If you are unable to afford one of the big ticket items on the wedding registry, you can always go in with a group of friends to purchase it. For example, the couple may have asked for a new mattress that is far too expensive to give alone. Try asking 10 other guests to each chip in a minimum of $100. This will allow you to save a bit of money, but still give a large and meaningful gift.This is a great idea for members of the wedding party.

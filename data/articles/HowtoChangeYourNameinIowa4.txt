 If you and your spouse are divorcing, make the minor's name change part of the legal proceedings. Your lawyer will be able to advise you about the necessary steps, but this way, you won't need to file a separate petition or form.You may still need to change the minor's birth certificate to reflect the new name. Ask your lawyer if any forms are needed to complete this separately or if it's included in the divorce proceedings.
 If you'd like to change a minor's name, but aren't going through custody or divorce proceedings, file a petition with the district court clerk. You'll need to pay $185 and fill out a form that includes this information:The minor's current name
The address and county where the minor lives
The new name
The petitioner's name and relationship to the minor
A description of the child that includes height, weight, hair and eye color, race, sex, place and date of birth
Every place the child has lived since birth
A brief statement of the reason for the name change request.
Attach a certified copy of the minor's birth certificate.
 You'll need to get the minor's written consent if he's over 14 years old. If the minor is under 14, both parents that are listed on the minor's birth certificate have to consent in writing. If one parent consents while the other doesn't, a hearing will be called.The court may decide that it doesn't need both parents' consent if a parent has abandoned the minor, a parent hasn't supported or financially assisted the minor, or if the parent no longer objects to the name change.

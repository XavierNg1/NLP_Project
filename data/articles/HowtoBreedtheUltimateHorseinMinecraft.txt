 In your first group, you will breed your horses with others of the same type. The typesÂ you need are:


2 Strong horses (jumps while rearing)
2 Healthy horses (lots of health)
2 Speedy horses (incredibly fast)
2 Obedient horses (stays when you want them to, doesn't run in fear)
2 Muscular horses (very large body)
2 Beautiful horses (the two most beautiful horses)
2 Sneaky horses (runs very quietly)
2 Jumper horses (jumps extremely high);
, This is the easiest stage of breeding. You just need to breed one horse with the other of its type. For example, a strong horse breeds with a strong horse. Repeat this until you have 8 baby horses. Afterwards, feed each of the babies to speed up their growth, and prepare 4 new pens.
 This is the hardest breeding stage. For this, you have to breed one horse with a certain type of horse. They are:


Strong with Speedy
Healthy with Muscular
Stealthy with Jumper
Beautiful with Obedient

, Now, breed the horses as shown here:


Strong and Speedy with Stealthy and Jumper
Healthy and Muscular with Beautiful and Obedient

,, If you did it right, you now have the ultimate horse! Now tame it, saddle it up, equip it with armor, and go off on your dream horse ride!

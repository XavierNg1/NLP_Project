 Psychogenic behavior is sometimes called obsessive-compulsive behavior and is a reaction to stress. In order to reach a conclusion that the cause of the over-grooming is psychological, all other possible causes of hair loss need to be tested for and ruled out.
 The act of licking causes the release of endorphins (natural occurring morphine-like substances) into the cat's bloodstream. This gives the cat a natural "high" to which they can become addicted.The trigger to the original episode of licking is usually a stressful event such as a stray cat moving into a new home. The cat resorts to licking to calm himself, and becomes hooked on the habit.
 To do this, try to show your cat that he has no competition for resources such as food, water, or sleeping spots. Provide plenty of toys to keep your cat occupied.


You should also give your cat plenty of places to hide if he is feeling stressed.
 Synthetic pheromones, such as Feliway, are chemical messengers that you can pump into the air to make your cat feel calm. The scent the synthetic pheromone produces is a scent that reassures the cat because his body interprets it as a feeling of safety.These synthetic pheromones come in spray bottles, which you can use to spray on the catâ€™s bedding, or as room diffusers, which help to make your whole house smell safe to your cat.

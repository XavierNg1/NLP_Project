 Doing this will prevent damage to your racks.
 Assist in the success of the cleaning cycle by scraping at large food stains to loosen them. This will make the resulting ash easier to remove later.


Use a kitchen tool with a straight edge to gently scrape away dried-on food. However, avoid very sharp edges, as this could scratch away the pyrolytic coating over time.
Don’t worry about getting all of the food stains scraped completely away. The goal is not to remove all of the material, just to help loosen it before the self-clean cycle.
 Find the button or setting within your oven’s control panel or knobs that says “Clean” or “Self-Clean.” Engage this function to begin the cycle.


Depending on your oven model, you may need to select a time period to run the cleaning cycle. Typically a full cycle runs between 2 and 4 hours to fully heat up to 800°F to 1000°F and then cool all the way back down. For some models, you can only use one setting, such as 4 hours.For safety, your oven model may also automatically lock the door of your oven for the duration of the cleaning cycle.
 If your oven doesn’t lock the door automatically, engage the lock by pressing a “Lock” or “Control Lock” button, or manually moving a lever to do so. Then wait the 2-4 hours it takes for the full cycle to complete.


Some ovens will feature a countdown or words on the display to indicate the phases of the cleaning cycle and the time remaining (for example, cLn 4:00).
Some oven owners experience problems with their ovens after self-cleaning cycles, especially after repeated cycles on older ovens. This is because the prolonged high heat can more quickly damage heating elements and electronic control panels. For a lower risk of this, try setting the cleaning cycle to just an hour if you are able to, or opt for a gentle manual cleaning.

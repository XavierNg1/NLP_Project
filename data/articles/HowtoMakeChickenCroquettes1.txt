 Set a heavy pot on the stove over medium heat. Melt the butter, then add the milk and chicken stock. Let the ingredients come to a low simmer.;
, Stir in the flour. Continue stirring until the mixture has thickened. Allow it to simmer until the mixture has the consistency of a roux.
 Fold in the chicken, garlic, and salt and pepper. Continue cooking for three minutes, then remove the mixture from heat and allow it to cool.
 Once the mixture has cooled, spoon about 1/4 cup of the batter and shape it into a patty. Place it on a tray lined with waxed paper or parchment paper. Continue shaping the batter into patties until you've used it up, then place the tray in the refrigerator to help the croquettes set.

 So make (or buy) your toy some clothes to make sure he or she is 'comfortable'.
 Finger nit it (look this up on WikiHow). Once you have a chain long enough to go round their neck three times, finish off the chain. Wrap it around their neck and loosen it. You don't want to strangle them!

, When one end of the cloth meets the other, cut the fabric. Sew the gap up (be careful not to sew it to your toy!).  Tie a 'belt' around the dress (A ribbon) into a bow.
,, Stick some cellophane to the lenses. Ta-da!

,,, If you don't think you have enough types of clothes, use some baby clothes or invent a way to make some clothes. Use your imagination!

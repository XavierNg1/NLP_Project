 It can be any flavor but be sure to choose what the party person likes best. The cake should be large enough to handle a decent amount of decorating on top, as well as providing enough slices for the guests you'll have at the party., There are a few ways you can decorate this car cake:

Frosting the shape and design of a car across the top of the cake. Use differently colored frosting to denote the car, its features and the background. Features can also be made using candies, etc.
Use royal icing to cover the cake. Make a road of black royal icing; have it curving across the cake. Add a model car on the road; either made from sugar paste or similar edible modeling food, or chocolate, or a clean plastic model car, which is removed once the cake is cut.
Frost the whole cake. Make a border of clean plastic toy cars or foil-wrapped chocolate cars around the cake. When the cake is cut, each guest also gets to keep the car that came with his or her piece of cake.
 For example, add Smarties in traffic light formation and colors; add road signs and barriers (use clean model toys); and even add some plastic people to the top.

Frost the cake. Make a giant number for the child's age and use this as the road. Add cars to the number road, either edible or plastic ones. Include racing flags for a finish line.

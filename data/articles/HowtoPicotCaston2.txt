 Start by making a slipknot about six to eight inches from the end of your yarn. To do this, loop the yarn around the needle or around your finger twice and pull one loop over the other. The, slide the loop onto the main (left hand) needle., Insert your right hand needle into the yarn as if you are going to knit it. Then, loop the working yarn over the end of the needle and pull it through the slipknot, but donâ€™t slide the slipknot off the needle., Pull out the yarn with your working needle to provide some slack and then turn the loop around and slide it onto the main needle. Then, tighten the loop by tugging on the working yarn. Now, you should have two stitches on your main needle., Next, position the yarn as if you are going to purl. This means that the yarn should be in front of the needle instead of behind it. Then, insert your working needle into the first stitch on the main needle purlwise, as if you are going to purl the stitch, and slide it onto your working needle and off of the main needle., Loop the yarn over your working needle to the right of the stitch you just transferred to the working needle. Then, knit into the stitch that is on your main needle. By doing this, you should end up with two more stitches on your working needle., Next, you will need to bind off a stitch. To do this, insert your main needle into the center stitch on your working needle. Then, pull the loop over the stitch to the left (nearest the tip of the needle)., Continue to insert the needle purlwise, knit a stitch, and bind off a stitch. Keep continuing this pattern until your chain is the desired length. Then, you can transfer the chain over to your main needle and knit as normal., To transfer the chain, insert the needle into the first loop on the chain. Then, yarn over and pull through to work the chain onto the needle. Keep going until the entire chain is on your main needle.After you have transferred the entire chain, then you can begin knitting as usual.

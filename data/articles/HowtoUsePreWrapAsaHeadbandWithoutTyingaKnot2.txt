 You'll probably want to wear it with a ponytail during games, but there's no need to stop there. Here are some ideas:


If you have short hair, you can still rock a pre-wrap headband. Just brush your hair like you normally would and place the headband so it sits at the top of your head. You can also use your headband to embellish different kinds of up-dos. Try a low ponytail, bun or chignon. Once you've put your hair up and styled it, put the headband on and secure it with some bobby pins. If you want to keep your hair down, you can still use the pre-wrap headband to push your bangs back. Simply pull the headband up over your face, then use it to push your hair back until the headband is a few centimeters past your hairline.
 Since pre-wrap is fairly cheap and it comes in an entire rainbow of hues, you can easily collect your favorites (some pre-wrap is even sold in packs of several colors). Try wearing two different pre-wrap headbands at once in shades that you think look good together â€“ or your team's colors!

, Get your team together and think of ways that you can use your pre-wrap headbands to stand out from the crowd. Pick a day when you'll all wear the same color; you could choose one color for home games and another for away games. Or, if you have two team colors, half of you could wear one and the other half the other.

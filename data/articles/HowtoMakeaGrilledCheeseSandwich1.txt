, During heating, begin slicing cheese and getting bread. It's a good idea to put a couple of tablespoons of water in the pan while it is warming up, when the water boils the pan is warm enough to put your first sandwich on. Just make sure you pour the remaining water out before you put a sandwich in.
 (you can also add some olive oil to the pan, if you want.) Then add the top slice right away. Lower the heat and cover to help the cheese melt.
 When bread is brown enough, flip. Dispose of the left over butter grounds out of the pan, so the next flip will be fresh.
 When it is cooked to your satisfaction, turn off the stove, put your sandwich on a plate, and enjoy.

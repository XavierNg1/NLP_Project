 This is one of the legit ways you can earn money quickly in the game.To trigger a mission in GTA III, check your map (located at the bottom left corner of your screen) for icons that represent missions. These icons could be pink- or green-colored blips or sometimes letter icons that represent the gang boss giving you the mission (e.g., L for Luigi).


Drive to the location. (To enter any car, press F and to drive use the W, A, S, and D keys to navigate.) When you arrive at the location, press F again to exit the car and then approach and stand in the blue marker. This will immediately activate the mission. A pre-mission cinematic will play that will give you the mission instructions.
Upon successfully completing the mission, a “Mission Passed” message will appear on the screen that will also indicate the money earned. A mission in GTA III can pay as little as $100 (e.g., the Home Sweet Home mission) or as much as $500,000 (e.g., for the Sicilian Gambit mission).

After you’ve started the game and entered the game world, just type in this cheat code as it is: ifiwerearichman. You do not need to press Enter after typing in the phrase.
Typing the phrase once adds $25,000 to your in-game cash, which is indicated on the top right-hand corner of the screen. The cheat may be used an indefinite number of times.

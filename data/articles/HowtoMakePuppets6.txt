 To make a basic stage, cover a table with a tablecloth that comes down to the floor. The table needs to be high enough that your children (or you) can easily kneel behind it without being seen.
 Paint a mural onto a large piece of cardboard and hang it from the wall behind you. The mural can be a setting (park, beach, etc) or just the name of the show in large letters. But remember, a sign should be put on the front of the tablecloth announcing what the show is. If you're doing this, the name of the show is not necessary in the mural.


Make a few props for your puppets to work with, too. In a couple of minutes, you can whip up a tree, a rock, some flowers, or whatever might be found in your puppet show setting.
 What's your opening music? Are you doing it improv style or will there be lines? Is there a moral to your story, or just for fun? If you're working with children, make sure each gets a turn at their favorite puppets -- each child will inevitably have one.

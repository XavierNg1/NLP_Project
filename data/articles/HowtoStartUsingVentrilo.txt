 Make sure to download the corresponding file for your Operating System (OS). For instance, if you are a Windows OS user you will want to download the "Windows i386 - 32bit" file. (The Ventrilo client is licensed free for users.) Next, when the software is downloaded, you will need to run the executable and follow the instructions on the screen.;
, Open up Ventrilo and you will be presented with a window. The first thing to do is set up your User Name.
, In this window you will be able to create multiple User Names for Ventrilo. Let's begin by setting up a User. Begin by clicking on the "New" button. A small window will open requesting you to enter your User Name. Enter it and click "OK" to continue or "Cancel" to try again. Type your User Name in exactly as you wish it to appear on the Ventrilo server.
 Now that you've added your User Name to your Ventrilo client, you can connect to a Ventrilo server.


This time you will need to click the arrow button (->) to the right of "Server". The "Connection Editor" window will pop up and you will then need to enter your details, but first click on "New". You will be prompted to enter a "Name" for your Ventrilo server. Enter a "Name" and then select "OK". Now you will be presented with fields to enter your Hostname or IP, (This is the IP in the Welcome email you received) enter it here. Then you will need to put the port to your Ventrilo server in the field labeled "Port Number". (This is the port in the Welcome email). If you specified a password you will also need to enter it here before proceeding. Make sure to hit "OK" to save your details.
 If everything went well, then you should be presented with the name of the server in the main window, and possibly other channels too if they have been added.

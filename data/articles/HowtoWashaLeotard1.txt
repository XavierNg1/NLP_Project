 The source of the stain will play a role in how you get rid of it. A tomato-based stain, for instance, requires a different approach to removal than an ink stain. Removal tools include chalk, baking soda, peroxide, and vinegar, each of them ideally suited to a certain type of stain.Vinegar is great for whitening and removing grass stains.
Oil stains (including face and body oils) are best removed with chalk or salt, as they absorb oil.
Coffee and other dark stains are best removed with a 1:1 ratio of baking soda and water to make a paste.
Peroxide is the most effective way to remove bloodstains, though it can have a bleaching effect.;
, After you have identified which stain remover is appropriate, place the removal method onto the stain, making sure your hands or laundry brush are clean and free of oil and debris.


Wash your hands before handling your leotards to avoid depositing dirt or your bodyâ€™s oils as you clean.
 Use a finger, a soft-bristle toothbrush, or a delicate laundry brush. If the stain is small, you can use your finger to rub the detergent in. If the stain is larger, enlist the help of a soft-bristle toothbrush (hard bristles can snag fabric) or a dedicated laundry brush with soft bristles., Rinse the stain in cool water--never hot. Hot water can set stains in fabric. Rinse the stained area with cool water, avoiding getting the rest of the garment wet, as this can cause the color or stain to run onto the rest of the fabric.


If you are treating a leotard with many different colors, all of them prone to running, you can place your hand underneath the stain to make sure only that portion of the leotard gets wet.
 After pre-treating, launder your leotard as usual, turning it inside out before washing. While all leotards can benefit from hand washing, make sure you at least wash your performance leotards by hand.


Your practice leotards may hold up well inside of a machine wash.

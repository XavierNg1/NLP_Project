 Ember. Moltres is the easiest bird to catch, but it takes a long time to get to it, and there are many obstacles along the way. First, make sure that you beat the 7th Gym, on Cinnabar Island, and get the Tri-Pass from Bill. Find your way to One Island (in the Sevii Islands), and get all the way to the top of Mt. Ember. In order to pass the obstacles along the way, you must bring Pokémon that know Surf, Strength, and Rock Smash.


Moltres is the only legendary bird whose location differs from the original Red and Blue versions of the game. In Red and Blue, you can find Moltres along Victory Road.Surf, Strength, and Rock Smash are HMs. You can only teach them to certain Pokémon. Learn how to get all the HMs if you don't have them already.
 Make sure that you have at least 30 Ultra Balls. Also, bring a couple of Max Repels – the way to Moltres is long, and there are a lot of strong Pokémon there.
 This makes your Pokémon immune to Moltres' only two attacking moves. It will make the battle much easier – Moltres won't be able to hurt you at all!Vulpix has Flash Fire, as does Ponyta. You can catch a Ponyta right outside of Mt. Ember, where Moltres is found. It will take zero damage from Moltres for the duration of the fight, so level and HP don't matter.
 Make sure to save before the battle. The most successful way to catch this bird is to get its health into the red, then give it a status condition like Freeze, Sleep, or Paralyze. Once you have weakened Moltres, keep tossing Ultra Balls at the bird until it's caught.

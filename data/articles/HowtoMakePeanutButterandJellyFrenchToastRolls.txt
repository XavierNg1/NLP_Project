 Get out a pan, a bowl, a fork, a turner, and a knife and spoon for the peanut butter and jelly.


Crack some eggs in a bowl and whip it up just like you would do when making french toast. Make sure there is enough to make the amount of rolls you want.






Take a piece of bread and spread peanut butter over half of one side and jelly over the other. Or, if you like jelly in every bite, feel free to put as much as you want on. Carefully roll up the bread. On the crust that's on the end and is supposed to "seal it" put some peanut butter there and it will stay.






Get some butter in a heated pan.

Dip the rolls in the egg mixture.






And throw it in the pan. All there is left to do is watch and make them just like you would make french toast - have fun!

 Make a list. Be sure to include the preferred size, shape, color, breed, make, etc.;
,, If you need a small area for your plush, choose a doll house. If it's big, try your bed. You can even make a house of your own. If you want more teddies, plush animals, soft toys or stuffed animals to live there, make sure that there is room.
 Add a toy bed, dresser, lamp, television, and DVD player. You can also make some books for them optional.



Find or buy a small bag (at least 10cm x 10cm) for your Teddy's first aid kit. Put kitchen or toilet roll for bandages, safety pins for holding wounds and bandages together, water in case your teddy gets thirsty or for washing wounds. Put these in a small pile with a plastic or cardboard suitcase see ] but don't tie it to your teddy
Make your Teddy's purse. Tape, glue, or staple a 10 by 10cm slip of paper together. It should end up about 5 by 5 cm.
Make a phone credit\debit card, and some fake money small enough to fit in the purse.
, Put the first aid kit and the purse in it. Not the clothes you need to know if they fit

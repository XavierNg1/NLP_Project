 Epona is Link’s (the protagonist of the game) trusty horse, and she can take the hero wherever he needs to go. Many versions of the game—like the Ocarina of Time, Majora’s Mask, and Twilight Princess—will allow you to ride the horse at the very start of the game or at least near the beginning. Just play through the normal storyline of the game and you’ll eventually be able to ride Epona.


Epona is not available on all versions of Legend of Zelda, especially those on portable gaming consoles like Game Boy and Nintendo DS.;
, Walk towards the horse and approach its side. Press the Action (A) button on the controller of whatever Nintendo console you’re using, and Link will get up and sit on the saddle of Epona.
 Once your character’s sitting on the saddle, press the directional arrow buttons of your controller to start moving. Epona will move and take you to any direction that you want to go.


Just remember that Epona is not a car and will have trouble backing up and moving around tight corners. Take time to practice and become familiar with the controls.

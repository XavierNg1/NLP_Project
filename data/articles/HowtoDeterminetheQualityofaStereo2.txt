 Test your stereo with different sources and at different volume levels. Be sure to pay attention to any buzzing, static or distortion you might hear. Flaws like these are often signs that a sound system isn’t doing the audio justice.If possible, try playing the same source through different stereo systems (or the same stereo through multiple sets of speakers) so you’ll have a better basis for comparison.When shopping for a new stereo, ask if you can give each model a test listen in-store before you make a decision to buy it.
 As a rule, a superior stereo system will cost you more than a mediocre one. Those who aren't keen on the idea of shelling out thousands of dollars for a top-of-the-line model, however, should consider settling on a slightly less powerful system that will save them money while still performing to a high standard.

You can expect to pay at least a couple hundred dollars for a worthwhile stereo.If you’re on a budget, go with a basic receiver with a decent wattage, wider dynamic range and all the extra device inputs you need to enjoy your favorite music and movies., Rather than being wowed by the way a sound system looks, focus on its technical capabilities. Size and quality have very little to do with one another, and too many consumers make the mistake of assuming that the larger a stereo is, the more impressive it will sound. Remember: bigger doesn’t always mean better.It’s the hardware inside that matters, not sleek construction or fancy packaging.
 If you’re having trouble keeping up with all the technical details, set them aside and trust your intuition. At the end of the day, your own ears are the best judge for whether or not a stereo system is up to par.

Some audio characteristics, like the balance between high and low frequencies, are simply a matter of personal preference.

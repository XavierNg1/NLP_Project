 Set your oven to high to get your cast iron skillet very hot. This is essential for this method of cooking because the heat from the skillet will finish cooking your meat, not the heat from the stove's burners., Applying butter, oil, or cooking spray will prevent your meat from sticking to the bottom of your skillet, especially if you are using a dry rub.Make sure not to put butter or oil in the skillet for too long while you're preheating because it could burn and make your London Broil inedible.
 Briefly cook each side of meat, making sure that there is a dark black or brown caramelization on each side.Overcooking the meat in the skillet will make it overly chewy.
 Create a tent over your cast iron skillet with a large piece of tin foil. The heat from the skillet should finish cooking the meat. Once you wait 5-10 minutes, make sure to test the internal temperature of your London Broil with a meat thermometer.,

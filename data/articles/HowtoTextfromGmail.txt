 In order to email a text, you'll need two pieces of information: the recipient's full phone number (10 digits for the US) and their phone carrier (AT&T, Verizon, TMobile, etc.)., Log on to your Gmail account.
 Click "Compose Mail" to start a new message.
 Write out the full 10 digit phone number in the address bar.
 Follow the phone number with the SMS gateway listing (the "domain name" for the carrier which reroutes the message). It should come out looking something like "1234567890@txt.att.net" or "1234567890@tmomail.net". The most common SMS gateway listings are:


Verizon: @vtext.com
TMobile: @tmomail.net
AT&T: @txt.att.net
Pinger: @mobile.pinger.com
Sprint: @page.nextel.com (Credo worked via sprint using @messaging.sprintpcs.com )
Cricket: @sms.cricketwireless.net

, Enter your message as normal and click send when you're done. Your SMS will be sent to the phone number you entered.

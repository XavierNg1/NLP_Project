 This version of beanbag race also works best with an even number of players. Once the players are separated into two teams, line players up into two rows, one row per team.In the event you have an uneven number of players, the team with one less player should choose one player to go twice. This player will start at the head of the row.
 Each team should receive one beanbag apiece. Any size beanbag should work fine, though you may want larger beanbags for smaller children, as these will be easier to handle., This can be done easily by yelling something like, "On your marks... get set... go!" You could also use your phone to play a game starting sound effect, like a siren, a bell, or a whistle., For very young children, simply passing the beanbag may be enough of a challenge. For older children/adults, have players pass the beanbag in a certain style, like with only their left hand, over their left shoulder, under their right leg, and so on. For uneven teams:Have the player at the head of the row for the team with one less player pass the beanbag then run to the end of the row.
When the player passes the beanbag for the second time, sending it back toward the head of the row, have them run to their starting position.
When the beanbag and the player going twice both reach the head of the row, the race is complete.
 If you only want to play once, you're finished. If the same teams want a rematch, simply restart game. Otherwise, shuffle players between teams and play again in the fashion described.


To keep things interesting, you may want to change the style in which the beanbags are passed or make it more complicated.

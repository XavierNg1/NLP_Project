 This method will only work for leather sandals. Rub soap around the areas the sandals are likely to rub against your toes, feet, ankles, and heels. This will help to slightly stretch the leather. The soap will also soften the friction between it and your sandals. The best type of soap to use is saddle soap. Apply it with a damp cloth and wipe it off until the shoe is dry., Put a Band-Aid inside of the sandal in places you think it might rub. Use thick Band-Aids or moleskins. Flimsy Band-Aids will probably peel off throughout the course of the day. Moleskins are usually pretty thick, but be sure to purchase a moleskin with an adhesive.You can buy the Band-Aid Friction Block Stick. It is $8 and looks similar to a small stick of deodorant.
 If you feel the lack of arch support, or lack of cushioning is spoiling your experience of walking, add an inner step to the sandal to provide cushioning and support. Special insoles can be purchased that add softness to the insole zone of a sandal. Look for insoles that are cushioned for hard, flat sandals, and shoes. It’s ideal if they absorb moisture as well.Dr.Scholl’s has a variety of arch supports.
 If your find that your sandals are slightly too big, you can insert a heel grip into the back. The heel grip will prevent slipping and make up for the extra space. Heel grips come in several different materials, including sponge, suede, and rubber.Pedag and Dr.Scholl’s make heel grips.
 You should only waterproof your sandals if they are made of fabric. Waterproofing your shoes can prevent water from seeping inside of them, which can cause rubbing and blistering. To waterproof your shoes, buy some bees wax and rub them on the entire outside fabric portion of your sandals.Depending on the type of sandal, it may already be made of a waterproof material.

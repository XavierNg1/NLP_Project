 Large spreads of ivy can quickly swallow up whole trees, and kill them off by choking off their roots. Check your tree to determine its health, and how much of it is covered by ivy. Depending on the amount, it may be too damaged to save and may need to be removed along with the ivy.
 Thankfully, it is not necessary to remove all of the ivy on a tree in order to kill it off. The root system of the ivy is in the ground, so you only have to remove the bottom-most section of ivy and the rest will eventually die. If there is little enough, you may be better off pulling out all the ivy. If your tree is nearly engulfed, measure out a space about 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m) high from the roots of the tree up the trunk, and outwards in a radius of about 3 feet (0.9 m) on the ground.
 Use a pair of gardening shears or a small hacksaw to cut away at the ivy in sections around the base of the tree. It will take a bit of elbow grease to get it all pulled away from the tree, and there will probably be pieces that break off from the roots, but don’t worry about it just yet. Focus on getting the majority of the ivy off from the roots and trunk of the tree., Go around the tree a second time with your shears, this time severing ivy vines at the highest point you can safely reach. Tear the cut sections off the tree. This will ensure that you haven't missed any vines, and minimize the fire hazard from dead vines.
 With the majority of the ivy removed, make your way around the tree and pull off any smaller pieces or intact roots that you see. This will prevent the ivy from growing back and filling in the space you just cleared.
 Carry the ivy you pulled away from the area, and store it in a dry, flat area (on rocks or concrete is best) until you can destroy the plant.

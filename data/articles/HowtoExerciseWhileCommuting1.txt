 This is best if your commute is 30 minutes or less and you have somewhere to store the bike at work. Judge if this is a good change for you based on how safe the route would be.


Remember that you don't need an expensive bike, but you should invest in a helmet and reflective tape. Buy a cyclist's hand-signal guide and follow these directions carefully. You may want to buy a backpack or messenger bag that is easy to carry, and bring a change of shoes for work.;
, Map out your route to work, and if it is 3 miles (4.8 km) or less, experiment with walking to work in shoes with good arch supports. You may find this is a great stress reliever after work, giving you time to breathe and exercise after a stressful day.


Make sure you have sidewalks or parks along the way that you can use. Never walk on highways, lawns or unsafe roads.
 Although this is usually seen as a bad thing, if you park a half a mile away from your office, you will get an extra mile of walking into your schedule each day.
 If you sit all day in a chair, choose to stand on the bus, even if there are seats. Hold on to a handrail and flex your deep stomach muscles to gain stability through braking or turning.
 Never ride the elevator for one floor. If you suffer from knee pain, always take the stairs up but take the elevator down.
 Do calf raises, where you lift yourself onto your toes and hold the position for 10 seconds. You can also balance on 1 foot (0.3 m) or the other for 30 seconds, and raise yourself up on your toes for the last 10 seconds.


An alternate exercise is marching. Instead of walking in place, engage your lower abdominal (ab) muscles and march, raising each thigh until it is parallel with the ground. Do this for 1 minute sets or until you feel muscle fatigue.

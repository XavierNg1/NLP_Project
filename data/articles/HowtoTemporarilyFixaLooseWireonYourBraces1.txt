 Wires can come loose over time, or due to chewy food. Make sure the bracket itself is still attached to your tooth. Also, make sure that the wire has not come completely out of the bracket.If the wire has come out of the bracket attempt to slide it back into place. You may need someone else to help you with this.
If the bracket has come off of your tooth as well, call your orthodontist to have it put back on.;
, Many things can be used for this purpose. You can use a pencil eraser, the back of a spoon, or a cotton swab. If you don’t have any of these on hand, look for another small, dull object to do the job.Make sure whatever object you use is clean. You never want to put something dirty into your mouth.
Cotton swabs are clean right out of the package.
You can wash your spoon with dish soap as you normally would.
 Gently slide the object into your mouth. You may need to look in a mirror to see what you’re doing. Press the wire back into place so that it sits close to your teeth once more.If you can’t see what you’re doing in the mirror, you can ask a friend or family member for help.
Be gentle as you push — the wire can slip out and pierce your cheek or gums. You don’t want to hurt yourself or knock another wire out of place.
 With your tongue, feel the area where the wire came loose. It should feel similarly to how it did before coming loose. If you have any discomfort or if the wire is scraping your cheek, you should try another method or book an appointment with your orthodontist.

 If you have the chance to remove any debris or sharp pieces, this is the ideal time to do so before anything starts working its way into the tire.


Also check the sidewalls of the tires. If you see cuts, splits or tears, these indicate areas where the tire may break under pressure.
 When the tread has worn off, it's far easier for puncturing items to work their way through the tire.
 Stay alert for things that might harm your bike tires, such as broken bottles and smashed glass. Stay out of the gutters where broken things tend to accumulate. Be careful when riding through areas where there are thorns and other spiky parts of plants; some seasons may be worse than others depending on the life cycles of the plants.
 So, always check that your cycle tires are filled properly before riding it.

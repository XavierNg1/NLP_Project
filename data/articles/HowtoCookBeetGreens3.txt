 Raw beet greens have an even stronger flavor, so they're best paired with other powerful ingredients. Mix with feta, Romano cheese, goat cheese, or anchovies. Tahini, strawberry vinaigrette, or another strong or acidic dressing complements this salad well.


Beet greens become more bitter and tough as they age. When serving raw, it's best to stick with the young greens sold in late spring or early summer., Sauté with other aromatic ingredients, then mix it into the soup for the last couple minutes of simmering. This works well in thick soups made from lentils or a cream base.
 These chips are a little thicker and taste a bit "plantier" than other leaf green vegetables. But if you've converted to the beet green fans and want them on the go, this is a great recipe:Preheat oven to 350ºF (175ºC).
Cut off stems, wash and pat dry the leaves.
Toss leaves with a light coating of olive oil. Add salt and pepper if desired (taste first; beet greens are already salty).
Bake on parchment paper-lined pans for 15 minutes, turn, and bake for 10 more minutes.

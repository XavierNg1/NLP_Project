 The wide end of the tie should be on your right side. Make sure that the wide end is hanging slightly lower than the narrow end, about 2 inches (5.1Â cm). Make a small dimple on the wide end at the central line.





The wide end will not move during the tying process, so place it at the height where you would normally want your tie to end up.;
, Leave the wide end hanging in its original position. Fold the narrow end underneath the wide end to the left.
 Pull it behind to the right. Cross it back in front of the wide end and then pull it through the back of the neck loop. The narrow end should now be in front on your right side.









Make sure the knot is tight at this point

,, Loop it through the new opening created over the wide end. Pull the knot tight, with the narrow end being pulled upwards to the right.
,, The narrow end will go back through the loop created above the knot, pulled towards the right side. Tighten the knot. There should be a small amount of narrow end left at this point.









Tuck the remaining narrow end into your collar. The tie is complete.

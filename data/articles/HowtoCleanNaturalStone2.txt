 Saturating the area with water first will fill the pores of the stain and make removing it easier. Spray down the area with water or use a wet sponge to saturate the stain.Refer to your stone manufacturer to determine which kind of poultice you need.
Most stone poultices are safe on travertine, marble, slate, and granite.
 Read the instructions on the back of the stone poultice, so you know exactly how much water to use. Slowly pour warm water into the poultice powder in small batches, mixing it thoroughly in between each batch. Keep adding water until the poultice forms a paste similar to peanut butter., Before you cover a large stain with the poultice, you'll want to make sure that you have the right chemicals for the right stone.If the chemical discolors or stains your test area, do not use it on your natural stone.
 Cover the stain with the poultice using a wooden spatula. Extend the paste for about an inch (2.54 cm) around the stain. Use the spatula to even out the poultice.One pound of poultice will cover one square foot of natural stone.
 Put a piece of plastic wrap over the stain and secure the edges of the plastic with pieces of tape. Make two slits into the plastic wrap to let the poultice breathe., The paste will start to harden and will begin to draw out the stain. Do not disrupt or move the paste while it is sitting., Use a plastic or wooden scraper to remove the poultice from the stone. Break up bigger chunks of the poultice while taking great care not to scratch your natural stone., Clean the stain with a pH neutral soap and water before rinsing and drying it. Make sure that no more poultice paste is left over., It may take several applications for the stain to be completely gone. Continue mixing and applying the poultice paste to the stain until you start to see the stain diminish or disappear.It may take up to five separate applications for the stain to be completely removed.

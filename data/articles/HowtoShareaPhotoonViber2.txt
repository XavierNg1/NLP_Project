 Look for the Viber app on your smartphone. It’s the one with the app icon with the purple background and with a phone inside a chat box. Tap on it to launch it.
 From the bottom menu, tap the Chats icon. This will display your chats inbox with all your conversations. Select the person you’d like to chat with by tapping on his corresponding name. The chat window will appear.
 If you want to send a newly taken photo, tap the plus icon from the left of the Compose field. This will bring out a small menu of possible items you can insert with a message on Viber. Tap the “Take Photo or Video” button.


With this function, you can also send a newly-taken video.
Be sure Viber has access to your smartphone’s camera and microphone.
 Viber will enable your smartphone’s camera and let you take a photo (or a video). Compose and shoot to take your new photo. Use your camera’s standard functions to do so.
 Once you’ve taken the photo you like, tap the Save button. This will load the newly taken photo on your screen.
 Tap the “Send” button from the upper-right corner when you’re done. The photo you’ve just taken will be sent to your contact.

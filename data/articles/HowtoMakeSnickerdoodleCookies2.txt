 If you really love the spiced aspect of the cookies, you should up the ante a bit. Add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon to the dough for a darker, richer, and more spiced snickerdoodle. You could even try a few more spices, such as:Chai spice
Pumpkin pie spice
Ground nutmeg and cloves
Ground ginger, Add 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder along with the flour, stirring in everything else like normal. Then, if you'd like an added punch, add in 1/2 cup of chocolate chips after you've incorporated all of the four. You can either roll the final cookie in cinnamon sugar or a dusting of cocoa powder and white sugar., The sharp, slightly sour hint of citrus goes incredibly with the cinnamon sugar and is easy to add. Simply toss in either of the following ingredients in with the eggs for a wonderfully light cookie:


2 tablespoons orange juice, 1 tablespoon orange zest
1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon lemon zest, If it goes well with cinnamon sugar, it will go well in your snickerdoodles. The choices here are endless, but common add-ins include:


White chocolate chips
Butterscotch morsels
Dried cranberries
Toasted walnuts or pecans.
 Added to the flour, this little burst of cafe will give a light coffee flavoring to the cookies without overpowering them. This little bit of flavoring goes particularly well if you toss in some chocolate chips, as well., You'll want to use 2 tablespoons rum or syrup in place of the single teaspoon of vanilla extract. Both versions go well with add-ons, with dried fruit matching the rum well and toasted nuts complementing the maple syrup sublimely.

Be sure to weigh the cosmetic benefits against long-term health risks., Certain medications, such as retinoids and some antibiotics, can dramatically increase your skin's susceptibility to sun damage. Before you tan, carefully read all warning labels and literature for your medications, vitamins, and health supplements. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.If you are taking any unprescribed dietary supplements or herbal medicines, it is very important to do your own independent research. The FDA regulates this class of products much more loosely than conventional drugs. Warning labels are not required, and supplements may actually contain ingredients with different concentrations and even identities than those advertised., Indoor tanning uses high-intensity UV rays that are often too much, especially for fair skin. Although tanning beds are marketed as a safe alternative to natural sunlight, they actually represent a number of added health risks:


Premature aging of the skin.
Blinding eye diseases.Infectious diseases, such as herpes and warts, from improperly-cleaned equipment.

 Though squeezing, poking, or prodding the ingrown hair can lead to infection, you can try to raise the ingrown with a sterilized needle.Use a loose needle, such as a safety pin or a sewing needle. You can easily disinfect a needle by soaking it in rubbing alcohol.


Wear medical gloves if available to avoid contaminating the needle.
Other ways to sterilize needles include steaming and microwaving.
 Before you use the sterilized needle on the ingrown, you should place a warm wash cloth over the ingrown hair. Leave it on for a few minutes to allow the skin around the ingrown hair to soften. This will make it easier to raise the ingrown with the needle., Hold the needle in one hand and try to pull the skin away from the ingrown hair until it is exposed. You should see a hair curled in on itself just below the surface of your skin. Use the needle to raise the ingrown hair out of your skin until the hair tip is exposed. Be very gentle as you do this, as you do not want to poke yourself or damage the area around the ingrown hair., If you tend to wax, shave, or tweeze the area with the ingrown hair, take a break and let your skin heal. Shaving, tweezing, or waxing the area will only irritate in the ingrown hair and could lead to the development of more ingrown hairs in the area.

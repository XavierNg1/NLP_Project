 There are many substances that will crystallize using the techniques above. You can buy many of them from chemical supply stores. Here are a few options:


Copper sulfate for blue crystalsChrome alum for purple crystalsCopper acetate monohydrate for dark, blue-green crystalsWarning: These chemicals may cause harm when inhaled, ingested, or handled with bare hands. Read the safety information on the label and do not allow children to handle them unsupervised.
 Tie several pipe cleaners or rough wires together in a star shape. Lower these into your salt solution, and watch small crystals coat the star and turn it into a sparkling snowflake., Instead of making a single crystal, why not create a cupful? Make your salt solution, then pour over cut up sponges or charcoal briquettes in the base of the container. Stir in a little vinegar, and watch crystal formations grow overnight.Pour enough to saturate the sponges without submerging them.
To make different colors of crystals, add a drop of food coloring to each sponge.

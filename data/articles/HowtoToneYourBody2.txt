 Do cardio exercises three times a week, alternating between workouts like these:


Go power walking or running for 30 - 40 minutes. It's important to make sure your heart rate is raised the whole time. If you're breathing heavily and sweating, you're probably getting a good enough workout. You can buy a heart rate monitor to measure your heart rate and make sure it's properly elevated.
Try swimming, biking, hiking or playing a team sport. All of these exercises keep you moving for an extended period of time. Mixing things up will help you stay interested in exercising.
 Incorporating some resistance training will help you see results much faster. After a few weeks, the contours of your muscles will be defined, and you'll have more energy than ever.


Pay attention to all of the muscle groups. Do resistance training that focuses on your arms, back, shoulders, legs, and torso.
Try some basic body weight exercises, like lunges, push ups, chin ups, squats, sit ups, or burpees (also known as squat thrusts).
 Participating in a yoga class 2-3 times a week is one great way to get stronger and healthier. Yoga is good for building both flexibility and strength.

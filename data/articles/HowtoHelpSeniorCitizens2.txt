 Some senior citizens enjoy being out and about during the summer. There are a variety of activities that some senior citizens enjoy, including celebrating holidays with family and friends, walking out in the sun, and swimming.


Find out what activities senior citizens enjoy doing and plan something fun to do. You can say something like, “What activities do you enjoy doing during the summer?” to gauge what the senior citizen is interested in and then plan something accordingly., Sometimes senior citizens receive gifts from family or friends that they do not know how to use because they are unfamiliar with the technology. Ask a senior citizen if they need help with using a device, such as an iPhone, and then show them how to use the device.You can say something like, “Can I show you a few things on how to use that phone?” to open the conversation in a way that doesn’t sound condescending. Then, show them how to navigate the device and how to execute important functions, such as placing a call, texting, and using the contact list.
If you have time and they are interested, show them how to download and play some games or use a fun app.
 Most nursing homes have game nights and social nights that keep senior citizens occupied and socializing with others. Inquire as to how you can help at these events at your local nursing home. It is likely that they rely on volunteers like you to operate these events!

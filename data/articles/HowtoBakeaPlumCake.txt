 Remove the pan from the heat and add plums, cut side down, into the syrup. Return the pan to the heat, and cook until the syrup is thick again. Be sure the plums don't stick to the pan. Cool the syrup and plums for about 20 minutes.;
, In the mean time, grease and flour a 9-inch springform pan.
 This should only take a minute or two.
 Use the "pulse" setting on the food processor to mix the ingredients.
 Process the ingredients until the batter is smooth. This should take under a minute. You may want to scrape the bowl with the spatula to keep it from sticking.
 Using the spatula, smooth out the edges and the top of the cake.
 Stir them around until they are coated with the syrup. Place the plums evenly on top of the batter. Do not push them down in too far, let them rest at the surface.
 Bake the cake for about 40-50 minutes, or until golden brown. Put a wooden skewer through the center of the cake and remove; the cake is ready when the skewer comes out with only a few crumbs of cake.
, Lightly dust the cake with powdered sugar.

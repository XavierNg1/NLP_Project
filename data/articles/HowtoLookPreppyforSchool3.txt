 To embody a “preppy” lifestyle, take up a traditional New England activity such as tennis, fencing, rowing, golf, squash, or polo.

While these sports were traditionally reserved for private clubs and elite schools, organizations have been founded in different areas across the U.S. to give low-income children the right to participate (e.g.the Chicago Training Center, which offers rowing lessons to children from underprivileged backgrounds).If your school doesn't offer lessons in any "preppy" sports, look online for lessons or groups in your area.
If you aren't particularly sporty, consider simply attending such sporting events.
 Proper etiquette conveys the polite and demure behavior that contributes to looking preppy. Look online for instructions and manuals on proper etiquette in all situations that you should be prepared for. Some situations that may be relevant to your school life are:Informal dining rules
Cell phone etiquette
Conversational etiquette

, A good way to look preppy at school is to hang out with friends who are also preppy. While meeting new people to make friends can be intimidating, it is easier if you are confident, friendly, and forward about your approach. Start by simply complimenting someone or asking to sit with them at lunch.Try approaching a potential new friend by saying something like, "Hi, I'm John. I really like your Polo shirt. Would it be alright if I ate lunch with you?"

, Choose extracurricular activities that are popular in prep schools. Many of these activities are scholarly in nature and involve a great degree of commitment and academic strength. Some groups have special requirements for admission, such as Student Government, where membership is decided by election. Some examples of preppy extracurricular activities are:Debate team
Model UN team
Math team
Future Business Leaders club

 Perhaps you can find someone who has something you need, and you can arrange a trade. Newspapers and some online websites often have an area set aside for trades. You list what you have to trade and what you need while checking out the ads placed by others.


You can also offer to clean out a basement, garage or storage building in return for the contents of the area. This is often an excellent resource for free flooring materials such as carpeting or area rugs and lighting fixtures.

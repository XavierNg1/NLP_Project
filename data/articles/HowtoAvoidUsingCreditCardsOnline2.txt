If you're approved for a Bill Me Later purchase, Bill Me Later will immediately pay for your entire purchase. You'll then receive a bill to reimburse the company for the purchase.
Similar third-party services that pay for online purchases include eBillme, which sends you an electronic bill you pay and then supplies payment to the merchant, or 3V, which provides "virtual" credit card numbers funded from an account you can replenish at participating stores.

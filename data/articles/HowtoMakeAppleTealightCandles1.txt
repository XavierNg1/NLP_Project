 Simply hold the apple by the stem, either twist the apple around until the stem comes off, don't twist and give the stem a hard pull, or slice out the stem with a craft knife.;
, Place the tealight on top of the apple and trace around the bottom with a pen or pencil.
 Plunge the craft knife into the apple along the traced line, cutting a round hole. Cut about 1" down (2.54 cm) to create a hole deep enough to hold the candle.
 Cutting the X shapes will make it easier to remove the center of the apple.
 The pre-cut X shapes should lift easily. Then continue to hollow out the apple with your spoon.


Scrape around the sides of the pre-cut hole to create a smooth center and base to hold your tealight.

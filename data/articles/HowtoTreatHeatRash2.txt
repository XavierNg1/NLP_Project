 You don't want your fabric to rub against your skin uncomfortably or trap sweat close to your body. Synthetic fabrics and baggy clothing work best.
 Heat rash is commonly caused by exercise, when you have a higher body temperature and create lots of sweat. If you feel a rash developing, take a break and cool off.
 Cooling off, changing out of damp, sweaty clothes, or jumping into a cool pool from time to time can help your body effectively regulate temperature, preventing heat rash before it occurs.
 Most heat rashes occur in infants, when well-meaning parents over-dress their child during hot weather. Babies should wear loose, breathable clothing in the heat as well.


Just because a baby's feet or hands feel cool to the touch does not mean they are cold., Heat rashes can appear overnight when you are trapped in damp, hot sheets for extended periods of time. Use fans, open windows, or turn on the AC if you wake up sweaty and uncomfortable.

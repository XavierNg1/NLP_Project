 A multiple twist hairstyle is made by rolling sections of your hair into twists and clipping them at the top of your head. Itâ€™s a style that can work on any hair length, and is especially cute on short hair. Begin by brushing your hair or finger combining through it to eliminate any knots or tangles.
 After brushing your hair, push your hair over to one side to get it out of the way. On the opposite side, take a section of hair right above your ear that is about the width of two fingers. Use a bobby pin to create a clean, straight part going back.
 After separating the hair, twist it by rolling your fingers. Keep twisting until you have tightly twisted about 3 inches (7.62 cm) of the hair. Hold the hair at the end of the twist between your fingers.
 Pull the twisted section of hair straight back and against the top of your head. Then pin the hair using two criss-crossed bobby pins at the point right after the twist ends.
 After making the first twist, take the section of hair right next to the first and part it at an angle with a bobby pin. Repeat the process of twisting and pinning your hair down.
 Repeat making twists about three more times until you reach the hair on the other side of your hair. Then spray your hair and enjoy this cute hairstyle!You can leave your untwisted hair down or even put it in a ponytail if you wish.

 To start, wash your hair and towel dry it until it's just damp. Then, take a styling product that helps hold your hair in place. This can be mousse, gel, or hair spray. Choose whichever product tends to work best for your hair., Take a vertical section of your hair just in front of your ear. Curl the hair around your finger into a tight coil. Start at the tip of your locks and wind your hair up until it's secured on the base of your scalp., Use bobby pins to pin your hair in place. Thicker hair may require more bobby pins. You can also use hair ties or hair curlers to hold your coil in place., Move behind the first section of hair you curled. Repeat the process to curl another lock and then secure it with clips, pins, or ties. Keep curling locks in this fashion until all your hair is curled into tight coils.As beach waves are a more casual look, it doesn't matter if your sections are perfectly uniform. In fact, sections of slightly different sizes may help with the beach look.
 Leave your coils in place until your hair is completely dry. Times will vary depending on the thickness of your hair. Do not remove the clips until all your strands of hair are dry to the touch., Once your hair is dry, unclip your hair. Use your fingers to comb out the waves slightly to remove any tangles or frizz. You should be left with a fun, casual beach wave look.

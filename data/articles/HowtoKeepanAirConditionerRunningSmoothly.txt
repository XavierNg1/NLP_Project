 Having a professional HVAC technician come to your home and inspect your air conditioner is important. They will make sure that all the parts to your air conditioner are working correctly and that there are no faulty parts. They can also check your thermostat to make sure that your air conditioner does not turn on at odd hours. The air ducts are also checked to make sure that there is no blockage in the air ducts that is preventing cool air from getting to parts of your home.

Oftentimes the people who installed your air conditioner are qualified to do this.;
, Your AC unit pulls air into it to cool your home off. If you have a unit that sits on the ground, there is a higher likely hood that it will pull dirt and debris into the unit. This can cause damage to the parts inside of your air conditioner. Make sure that you clear the area around it about once a month. If you have a unit that sits on your roof, this is not as much of a worry for you., This may seem like common sense, but a surprising number of people will open doors and windows even when their AC is on. Having doors and windows open means that you are letting all of the hot air inside your home, which heats it up. This will cost you money because your air conditioner will turn on more often. It can also cause wear on the parts, which may eventually create the need for a replacement AC. So keep those doors and windows closed., Make sure that you change the filter inside your home about once a month or so. These filters collect dirt and debris and prevent them from coming into your home. If you do not change them, the dirt can get backed up and either go into your home or into your air conditioner. Prevent any damage from occurring and change your filters.

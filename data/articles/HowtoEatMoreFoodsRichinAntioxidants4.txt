 Select a variety of brightly colored produce, purchase products you enjoy eating, and even carry a list of good sources of antioxidants with you as you shop.
 Cleaning and slicing vegetables and fruits for snacks and quick meal preparation can make morning, on-the-go, and dinner additions of antioxidant-rich foods quick and easy.
 Bringing your own lunch to work or school allows you to select your antioxidant sources according to your preferences and ensures that you will be able to consume a serving or two of antioxidant rich foods for your meal away from home.
 When you purchase prepared food, opt for steamed vegetables over fries, request a side salad instead of mashed potatoes, or sip on black tea instead of soda. Scan menu options for meals that include strong antioxidant sources.

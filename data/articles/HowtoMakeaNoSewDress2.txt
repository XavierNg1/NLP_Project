 If you have strong fabric glue, you can follow the process above, but cut out the dress directly on the outlines. Cover the outline with glue where the two sides will attach, and press the two sides together until dry. Give this plenty of time to cure, then test the strength by pulling on the dress edge.
 Take a button-up shirt and put it on without putting your arms through the sleeves. Button it until it fits your chest snugly enough to stay on. Take the dangling sleeves and tie a bow or another decorative knot in the front of the dress.


To turn this into a halter top, cross the sleeves in an X shape over your chest and tie them behind your neck. Tuck dangling ends under your bra clasp.
 An elastic skirt is the easiest option of all. Pull it up to make it into a strapless top. Add some structure and shape with a belt.


If you use a tulle skirt or another light material, you can pick up the lower edges and cross them over to the opposite shoulders. Tuck them in to the elastic band at the back. Hold the dangling material in place with a lace belt.
 One common no-sew dress is really a sarong, or a large, wide piece of fabric that can be folded and tied in many different styles. With some practice, you can completely change the style of your sarong dress without dealing with stitches or wrinkles. This great benefit is also its main downfall, as the lack of stitches can make it difficult to keep the sarong in place. Be confident in your knot work or pin placement before you leave the house in one of these.


You can use a length of cloth about 6.5 feet (2 meters) long as a sarong.
 Cut a circle of cloth with a diameter equal to the length of your body (neck to thighs). Cut a hole in the center for your head, and two holes for your arms. Wear a belt to give this more shape.

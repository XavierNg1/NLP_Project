 Some people like to let their rabbits roam freely in their home. This may not be an option for you, however. Either way, your rabbit will need a cage. This cage should be a place where it can be safe, and not interrupted. Your cage can have a plastic or wooden bottom, but wire will hurt your dwarf rabbit's feet. This cage should be filled about 2 inches (5.1Â cm) deep with bedding. Carefresh and Yesterday's News are good brands. In the cage should be a litter box, a hideaway box, a food bowl, hay rack, and a water bottle.;
, You can put the pen outside if your lawn isn't fertilized and doesn't have other animals using it. Otherwise, you can designate an enclosed area in the house to let your dwarf rabbit to play. However, if you build a pen indoors, you should read how to rabbit proof your home.

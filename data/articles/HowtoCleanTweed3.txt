 Moths are attracted to wool. Put tweed items in a cedar chest or other cool dry receptacle, where moths cannot eat them. You can also buy moth deterrents at home improvement stores. Follow the instructions on the packaging to apply it.


Store garments in zip-up clothing bags for additional protection., If you have tweed upholstery, vacuum it weekly to avoid allowing dirt to become embedded in the tight weave of the fabric. Use a brush attachment and lightly run it over the surface of the tweed. Be sure to get into the cracks and crevices, such as the areas between cushions. You can routinely clean tweed garments this way, as well.
 It is a good idea to apply a fabric protector to tweed furniture as soon as you get it, and occasionally afterward. Check first to see if it has already been applied. If you have applied this in the past, a liquid stain should bead up and be fairly easy to remove by blotting. The fabric protector does not make it waterproof, however.

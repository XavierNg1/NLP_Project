 If you have a litter of kittens, look at the color of the cats; some cat colorations are gender-specific and can help you determine the sex of the cat.


Cats that are calico or tortoiseshell colored are typically female.
More orange or ginger colored cats are male than female, but this is not an accurate way to determine a cat's sex., It's easier to tell the sex of intact cats, since they naturally display the habits and characteristics of their sex.


Male cats that have not been neutered tend to be more aggressive than females and to have larger heads and thick skin. They like to roam, sometimes leaving for a few days at a time. They mark their territory by spraying it with strong-smelling urine.Female cats are less likely to spray their surroundings.
 Female cats that have not been spayed will go into heat, a state of fertility that enables them to become pregnant, every 3-5 weeks during warm weather (or in a house thatâ€™s climate controlled). Cats in heat display recognizable behaviors:


Making vocal sounds to attract males. The cat may sound like it is in pain or whining.
Moving the tail to the side to show genitalia or crouching into a receptive posture. The vulva may be secreting a clear discharge.
Rubbing up against inanimate objects, owners, or other animals more than usual.Pregnant female cats have low-hanging, distended bellies.
Female cats that have given birth may have nipples that protrude from their bellies. Be careful when using nipples to determine sex, since both male and female cats have nipples.

 You’ll only need to add a couple inches (three or four centimeters) of water to a saucepan. Put it on the stove and set the heat to low. Heat it slowly until it starts to simmer., Use a glass or stainless steel bowl, and place it into the saucepan so that it sits within the pot but doesn’t touch the simmering water. There should be at least an inch of space between the bottom of the bowl and the top of the water.Indirectly heating the milk in the glass or stainless steel bowl will ensure a slower, more even boil.
 Keep the heat on low so the water in the saucepan continues to simmer. Carefully pour the milk into the glass or stainless steel bowl. Stir frequently, and heat it until you see tiny bubbles around the edge of the bowl and steam rising from the milk.When the milk boils, turn the heat off and either use it or cool it according to your recipe.

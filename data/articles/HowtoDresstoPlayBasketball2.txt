 If you are a boy, pick briefs over boxers to provide ample support "down there" and eliminate distraction. If you are a girl, wear a sports bra rather than a regular one. Give yourself the proper support and plenty of mobility without having to worry about wires digging in or restricting your movement.Male players may also want to consider wearing a cup for added support and protection.
 If you normally wear glasses or contacts, invest in a pair of shatterproof eyewear designed specifically for high-contact sports. Wear a mouthguard to protect your teeth and tongue. Support any limbs and/or joints that have suffered past injuries by wearing fitted braces.If you wear high-top sneakers and find yourself needing to wear ankle braces as well, consider this a warning sign that your ankles may be losing their natural mobility. Your knees may start suffering next as they overcompensate on your anklesâ€™ behalf., Wear a sweatband around your forehead to mop up sweat before it can run into your eyes. Use elastic ties or flexible headbands to keep your hair out of your face. Tie longer hair back into a ponytail or braid.


Sweatbands around your wrist can also come in handy. They prevent your arm-sweat from running into your palms and thus ruining your grip on the ball.

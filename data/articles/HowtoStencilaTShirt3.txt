 A simple image with clear lines will work the best. If you will be using a darker color of plastic for your stencil, then make sure that you use thick, dark lines for your design., Tape your design to the table first, then tape the acetate over it. Trace over the design using a permanent marker. Acetate sheets and blank stencils work especially well for this.

You can find acetate in office supply stores and printing shops.
You can find blank stencil plastic alongside the regular stencils in arts and crafts stores.
 Transfer your stencil to a cutting mat. Cut out the design as carefully as you can using a sharp blade. Discard the inner parts of the stencil, and save the outer portion. You will need the straight edges to secure the stencil to the shirt; this design won't work on silhouettes., Place the stencil onto your shirt where you want the design to go. Smooth out any wrinkles or ripples, then tape down all four edges of the stencil sheet., The cardboard needs to be a little bit bigger than your stencil. It will keep the paint from soaking through the fabric and onto the back of the shirt., Work your way from the outside edge of the stencil to the middle. Do not drag the paint from center-out, or you will get paint under the stencil.You can use a foam roller, a pouncer, or a flat brush.
 As the paint dries, run your finger inside the shirt, between the fabric and the cardboard. This will keep the paint from sticking to the cardboard., Some types of fabric paints are ready to go once they dry. Other types of paints need to be covered with an ironing cloth, then ironed. Refer to the label on your bottle of paint for more specific instructions as each brand will be different.

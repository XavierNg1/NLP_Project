 Cut in a roughly circular shape to fit the egg. Leave the square crust intact.;
, Alternatively, you can fry the center part after the eggs are done, for a tasty and crunchy bread treat.
 Crack each egg into the center of each crust ring.
 The egg will move out to the edge of the crust and stay there.
 Here you have two choices. The egg can be removed from the crust and eaten alone, or you can eat both the fried crust with the egg attached (a double treat!).

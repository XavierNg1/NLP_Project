 Just hug him and tell him that you love him and that you're proud of him. You don't need any excuse for this; any time is a good time.
 This means setting aside the things you find annoying, bothersome, and unfair. Try to put aside your sense of competition and desire to outdo him. Simply list what things he does great and show you appreciate those activities.
 Bring him chicken noodle soup, take his temperature, or place a cool washcloth on his forehead. Be his doctor for a day.
 It’s quite common in many cultures to give kisses for a variety of reasons. Sometimes a peck on the cheek will do, and others a kiss on the lips. Maybe even the top of the head or forehead. Wherever the kiss, it’s a simple sign showing you are willing to display emotion., Hands and the surrounding area carry a lot of tension, and it’s not so invasive as to be awkward. This is especially useful if your brother uses his hands for work all day.
 Whether it’s rough-housing around, skipping together, playing tag, or a friendly game of punch-buggy, being physical with your brother is a different form of physical interaction he may enjoy. Breaking a sweat together is a great way to bond.

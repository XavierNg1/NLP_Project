 Keywords are the words that people search for in the search engines to find the information they require. If you have the exact wording or phrase that is searched for, in your article, then it is likely to have a good ranking in the search engines for that specific search, and potentially get you more traffic.;
, Google provides a free service called 'Google Adwords', which provides you with a list of keywords, based on a word or phrase that you type into the text box on the page. The Google Adwords tool gives you a list of commonly searched words and phrases, associated to the topic you entered, and tells you the 'Global Monthly Searches' of the phrase.
 Ideally you should have this list next to you when you are writing your article.
 It is best to start the title with a keyword and not words such as 'A' or 'The'.
 These keywords should be included naturally and the article should read smoothly. One keyword for every paragraph is likely to be enough. Don't over use keywords (keyword stuffing) - Google will notice and your website is unlikely to benefit and may even be banned.
 Check that it reads naturally and doesn't sound as if loads of keywords are 'stuffed in'. Also check your punctuation and grammar. Your article is now ready to be published on your website or submitted to an article directory.

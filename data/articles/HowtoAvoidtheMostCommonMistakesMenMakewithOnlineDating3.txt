 Forget about emailing for months and getting all worked up over email. The longer you leave it before you meet, the less likely it is to happen. Ask for a coffee date in the first two weeks of emails. This will save you a lot of time and energy and disappointments. If the other person doesn’t agree to meet, move on and don’t worry about it. There are plenty more.
 People tend to respect decisive partners. So decide/suggest the cafe, time and date. If the person can’t make it when you suggest, reschedule within reason. The person will get the impression that you are not timid and are comfortable making decisions. This is good, although being pushy, demanding, or adamant is not the image you want to convey, either; find that comfortable median. If she suggests a time or location that is more convenient to her, be as accommodating as possible.
 By keeping your cool, you will stay on your game during the date, not complicate things with "high" expectations, and thereby avoid disappointment. The goal is to have fun and see if there's potential chemistry, not to get serious and find out ASAP if you've found your ultimate soul mate.
 Talk about yourself enough to let her get to know you, but don't brag about all your accomplishments or unload all your troubles.
 Don’t mention past partners or that you haven’t been dating for a long time. Just have some fun and enjoy.

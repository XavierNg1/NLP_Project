 You should always greet your audience. Greeting your audience shows that you are confident and serious about the topic you will be debating about. It also shows that you respect your audience's opinion.Greet your audience by saying, “Good morning faculty and staff. The topic of today’s debate is student parking,” or “Good morning teachers and students. Thank you for taking the time to come to this debate. Today, the topic is student parking.”

, After you greet your audience, concisely state your team's argument. The audience can become distracted or lose interest if your statement contains too many words. Also, explain to your audience the speakers' roles.State what your side is arguing by saying, “We believe enrolled student’s should not have to pay for a parking pass to park on campus,” or “We believe enrolled students should pay for a parking pass to park on campus.”
Explain the speakers' roles by saying, “As first speaker, I will be defining key terms and outlining our main argument. Our second speaker will explain the supporting reasons for our argument, and our third speaker will summarize our argument.”

, Try to make eye contact with individual persons in the audience. By making eye contact, you can gauge their reactions by reading their facial expressions. Also, you will be able to connect with audience members on a more personal level, and thus, make your argument more persuasive.Remember to maintain eye contact with an audience at the end of a sentence.
Hold eye contact with an individual for only three to five seconds, then move on to someone else.
 Slow down your speaking by remembering to breathe while you speak. After you finish a sentence, take a deep breath, and then move on to the next sentence.Also, remember to take pauses. Pauses allow you to catch your breath and plan what you will say next. They also allow your audience to process what you have just said.

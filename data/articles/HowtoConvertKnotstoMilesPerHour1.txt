 A statute mile is what Americans commonly use to measure long distances over land. A statute mile is equal to 5,280 feet.A nautical mile is usually used to measure distances that are across open water or space. A nautical mile is equal to 6,076 feet. 

Knots are determined by how many nautical miles are being travelled per hour. 1 knot = 1 nautical mile per hour. ;
, This converts the rate in knots to feet per hour, since there are 6,076 feet in a nautical mile.

For example, if a boat is travelling at 17 knots, to find how many feet per hour, calculate 17Ã—6,076=103,292{\displaystyle 17\times 6,076=103,292}.
 Since there are 5,280 feet in a statute mile, to know how many miles per hour something is traveling, divide the number of feet per hour by 5,280.For example, if a boat is travelling 103,292 feet per hour, to find out how many miles per hour it is travelling, you would calculate 103,2925,280=19.56{\displaystyle {\frac {103,292}{5,280}}=19.56}So, a boat travelling at 17 knots is travelling about 19.56 miles per hour.

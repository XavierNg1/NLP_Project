 General encyclopedias cover various subjects and are generally well-known. For these encyclopedias, you should only provide partial publication information instead of full information.


Cite the specific article used. If you know the name of the author, begin the citation with the author's name; if there is no named author, begin the citation with the title of the article.
Encyclopedias are organized alphabetically, so you should not list the volume or page number associated with the article.Your citation for the “Works Cited” page should follow this format:

LastName, FirstName. "Title of Article." Title of Encycopedia. EditionNumber ed. PublicationYear. Print.
OR
"Title of Article." Title of Encycopedia. EditionNumber ed. PublicationYear. Print.


For in-text citations, you should include the last name of the author and the page number with the original information. For encyclopedia articles with no named author, abbreviate and use the title of the article and the page number.
Your in-text citation should follow this format:

(LastName PageNumber)
OR
(“AbbreviatedTitle” PageNumber)


Example:

“Internet.” Famous Encyclopedia. 3rd ed. 2015. Print.
(“Internet” 325)

;
, Subject encyclopedias only focus on one subject. Since these encyclopedias are specialized, they're generally unknown to the public, so you should provide full publication information in your citation.


Cite the specific article used. Begin the citation with the author's name if the article provides it; otherwise, begin the entry with the title of the article.
Unlike general encyclopedias, provide full publication information, volume numbers, and page numbers.Your citation for the "Works Cited" page should follow this format:

LastName, FirstName. "Title of Article." Title of Encycopedia. EditionNumber ed. Vol. VolumeNumber. PublicationCity: Publisher, PublicationYear. PageNumbers. Print.
OR
""Title of Article." Title of Encycopedia. EditionNumber ed. Vol. VolumeNumber. PublicationCity: Publisher, PublicationYear. PageNumbers. Print.


For in-text citations, use the author's last name and the page number of the original information. If there is no named author, abbreviate and use the title of the article instead.
Your in-text citation should follow this format:

(LastName PageNumber)
OR
(“AbbreviatedTitle” PageNumber)


Example:

Doe, John. "American Shorthair." Encyclopedia of Cats. 1st ed. Vol. 1. New York: Great Publisher, 2015. 20-23. Print.

, Online encyclopedias have citations rules similar to print versions, but you must provide additional information about the digital source.


Consult the rules for general and subject encyclopedias when structuring an online entry. The same rules regarding the information you must provide and the order of that information still apply.
Provide the name of the website or database used. You must also indicate the date you accessed the information.For the "Works Cited" page, follow this format:

LastName, FirstName. "Article Title." Name of Web Source or Database. Publisher, PublicationYear. Web. Access Date.


In-text citations only need to include the last name of the author or the abbreviated article title, depending on which comes first in the "Works Cited" entry. Do not provide paragraph numbers.
For in-text citations, follow this format:

(AbbreviatedTitle)


Example:

Smith, Susan. "Labrador Retrievers." Online Encyclopedia of Dogs. Great Publisher, 2015. Web. 3 August 2015.

 This will allow you to hit the strings of your instrument at a straighter angle. A straight angle will give your music a fuller sound. If the pick isn’t too tight, you should be able to move it to a slight angle. The pick should cover half of the tip of your finger if it is angled correctly., Scraping sounds will happen with metal picks, but you can reduce how often this happens by cleaning them. Use a soft cloth or chamois, which is soft leather. Use the cloth to rub the surface of the pick to keep dirt from building up.It’s also good to keep the strings clean so the pick doesn’t hit a dirty surface.
 This works best with the pick you wear on your thumb. Hold the pick with a pair of pliers. Dip the flat edge of the pick in boiling water, and hold it there for 10 seconds. Then, take it out of the water and twist the edge slightly while it’s hot. This will make the edge of the pick flat against the string, reducing the scraping noise.

 Drivers who own their cabs take 100% of the fares received, but also have a host of expenses, from the cost of the cab to insurance to licensing. Employees of taxi companies either receive a percentage of fares (typically about a third) or rent the cab daily or weekly and pay all fuel costs., Depending on the city or state where you are driving, getting started with your own cab can cost anywhere from about $5,000 – mostly the cost of the cab – to nearly a million dollars. Yes, one million. In big cities where the number of licensed taxis is limited, the cost of obtaining a license is often outrageous – $872,000 on average in New York, $560,000 in Boston, $300,000 in Chicago,and $325,000 in Paris– leaving new drivers little choice but to work for established companies. Overall costs include:The cab – Cars frequently used as cabs include Ford Crown Victorias, Dodge Caravans or Nissan Quests, Ford Escape Hybrids, and Toyota Priuses.They cost anywhere from about $3,000 used to over $30,000 new.Insurance – The requirements for taxi insurance are much higher than for private use of your car – between $5,000-$10,000 a year.Taxi meter – Around $180 used.
A top light - Cost from $150 for a basic roof topper up to $1300 for a video topper.
Car markings – You will need to put your business name and phone number on the side of your taxi. Decals start at $10-$25 per square foot., Working for a company means you will make less money per client, but it also comes without the prohibitive start-up costs. In addition, having a dispatcher can help you to get more fares. There are two ways that contract drivers get paid:Percentage – The company pays all costs, including gas, and you take home about 30% of each fare. In Boston, drivers average about $200 gross per day, meaning they would take home only $60. In New York the average is closer to $250 for a take of $75 per day.Leasing – The driver leases the cab and pays for gas, but takes home all fares. Renting a cab costs around $100 per day, with fuel costs of about $20, meaning take home pay of around $80 to $130 per day.

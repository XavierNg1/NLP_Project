 The day of the party, keep a checklist in hand and designate others to help. If you have extensive decorating to do, arrive at your location bright and early. Remember all your items and remember to pick up your balloons and the cake as well.


Keep your phone on you! Businesses or friends may be calling for directions or other questions.
 If people are coming to an area you are unfamiliar with, you may want to put balloons on the mailbox or little arrows along a walk. Or you may have to end up sending someone outside to flag wanderers down!


If you're doing it at a public place, ask what signage you can post and where to assist your guests in finding the appropriate area.
 When the bride opens her gifts, have a pen and paper handy. Sit next to her and write the name of the person who gives her each gift. This will be a huge help to the bride when she writes her "thank you" notes. In fact, many brides can't thank anyone without this list!

, Don't leave your location dirty after the party. Even if the party was thrown at the beach or a picnic area, you still need to pick up your mess. Send the bride home with the leftover cake and be sure the women have their favors. Hopefully a few other people will be kind enough to help.

 If you are taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin or ibuprofen for pain control, discuss this problem with a doctor and treat it separately.


If you are hurt or undergo surgery and need to take something for the pain, ask your doctor to prescribe you an alternative to NSAIDs. Abusing these painkillers can result in ulcers and reduce a substance called prostaglandin that protects the stomach.
If possible, stop taking pharmaceutical drugs altogether. Instead, choose natural anti-inflammatories like chamomile, ginger, and turmeric.
Do not self-medicate. Although there are over-the-counter drugs available for controlling the symptoms of acute gastritis, the relief they provide is temporary. A doctor can prescribe you something that will decrease and/or neutralize acidic secretions and effectively protect the mucosae.;

Never drink alcohol on an empty stomach, as this will increase your chances of getting stomach ulcers.
Serve yourself one drink only. At events and parties, limit yourself to one drink for the night and dilute it with seltzer. Alcohol erodes the stomach's mucous membrane and increases the production of gastric acids.
 Emotional or nervous gastritis is an acute illness experienced by people under high levels of stress, and can, in some cases, cause superficial hemorrhages.


Avoid stressful people, places, or situations. Stress increases the production of gastric acid and deteriorates the stomach's mucous membrane.
Exercise regularly. Physical activity stimulates the production of endorphins, also known as "happy hormones."
Meditate. Nowadays, you can find a wide variety of information, products and courses related to meditation almost anywhere. If that isn't your style, just take a few minutes each day to enjoy a personal moment of peace and quiet.
Try aromatherapy. Angelica, spearmint, and lavender are just a few of the essential oils that you can try out in order to better control your stress level.

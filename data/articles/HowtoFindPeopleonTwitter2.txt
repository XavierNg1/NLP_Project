 After searching for someone, click on the "Find Friends" link on the left side of the page, beneath the "Who to Follow" header. You'll be able to browse email contacts that use Twitter, and will be linked to their pages to follow them. Simply log into your email account (Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, Hotmail, Outlook, AOL Mail), then select which contacts you would like to follow.


You can log in to an e-mail account that was not used to originally create the account. Logging in and importing the contacts will also help Twitter suggest people for you to follow.
 Based off browser history, e-mail contacts, Facebook friends, and other sources, Twitter can make incredibly high-quality suggestions for those to follow. After searching for someone, Click the "View All" link next to the "Who to Follow" header on the left side of the webpage. Or, just go to this link: https://twitter.com/who_to_follow/suggestions. Click on a username to check out their profile or to follow them.

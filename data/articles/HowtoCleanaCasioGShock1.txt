 Even if you don’t have a waterproof G Shock, you can still use water on a damp cloth to target the problem areas on your watch. Run warm water briefly over a sponge or soft cloth, then squeeze to release excess water. Rub the areas of dirt or buildup carefully with the damp cloth. Your rubbing should cause the dirt to lift away from the surface of the watch.


Don’t use paper towels or other abrasive cloths to clean your watch, as they may cause scratches in its surface.;
, If using water to remove the buildup on your watch didn’t do the job, you may have to use a stronger cleaning solution. Rubbing alcohol is a potent and safe cleaner to use on Casio G Shock watches. To use, pour about a teaspoon (4.92 ml) of rubbing alcohol onto a soft cloth. Then rub the surface of the watch, as you did before with the wet cloth, to remove the dirt or buildup.If you successfully removed the dirt with the rubbing alcohol, wipe away any lingering rubbing alcohol with a damp cloth, then dry with a clean soft cloth .
 If you are tackling particularly stubborn dirt, it may be more effective to scrub at the buildup rather than to wipe it. Dip a toothbrush in warm water or rubbing alcohol, then shake it to remove excess liquid. Use the bristles to scrub in gentle circular motions on the dirt or buildup on your watch.Use a toothbrush with soft, as opposed to stiff, bristles.
 Dirt and other buildup often forms in the cracks and crevices of watches, making it difficult to clean. If you have dirt that has gathered in a hard to reach area, use a Q-tip dipped in water or rubbing alcohol to clean the spot.Make sure to pick out any fluff from the Q-tip that may get snagged on the edges of the watch.

 You are not going to be able to create the type of EMP you saw in the Matrix or Ocean’s 11. This type of Electromagnetic Pulse Generator works best for small electronics.;
, For this EMP you are going to take the circuit board and capacitor out of a disposable camera. Other supplies you’ll need are a:


Soldering iron
Enamel coated wire
On/off switch
Scotch tape
Flat head screwdriver
Pliers
Core wire
Wire strippers
Sandpaper
A circular object about two inches in diameter., You are dealing with high voltage equipment and could get shocked. When removing the capacitor in particular, be cautious. It’s also recommended to use a multimeter to gauge the voltage and a battery holder.A multimeter is a tool that measures the electric voltage of a circuit. You don’t need one, but it will tell you the voltage of your capacitor.

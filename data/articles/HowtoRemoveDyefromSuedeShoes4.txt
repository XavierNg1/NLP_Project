 Find a soft/clean pencil eraser or purchase a rubber cleaning stone. Then, softly rub the dye spot with your eraser or cleaning stone. This may remove some or all the stain. You may need to rub/buff the stained spot several times to remove all the dye.


If the dye comes off on the eraser or cleaning stone, you may need to rub it against something else to remove the dye from it. Then, you can use it on the shoes again., If the dye stain is somewhat new, you can try to remove it by rubbing it with fine sandpaper. In this case, use as small of a piece of sandpaper as you need to clean the dye spot. Then, gently rub the spot with your sandpaper. The sandpaper will remove any fibers that are stained.Be gentle. If you are too rough, you could damage the suede.
 After you use any sort of abrasive tool on your suede shoes, you’ll need to work the “nap” of the suede (the fuzzy part) back up. Do this by using a suede brush and brushing back-and-forth on the shoe in a gentle fashion. Continue to brush the shoe for several minutes.When you’re done, the fuzz of the shoe should point upward or slightly upward.

 Colleges are notorious for drug usage and this can harm your work performance tremendously.
 Don't get into a car with someone who has been drinking, either. It's better to have to phone a ride or a taxi then get into a crash.
 Start off slow, and feel out where your limits are. Blacking out isn't cool, it's dangerous. Don't get yourself kicked out or hospitalized because you wanted to party really hard.
 Don't leave it unattended, or accept a drink you didn't see poured.
 Colleges have the highest STD rates, and college is not the time for a pregnancy. Condoms and female condoms are not guaranteed to work, as there can be holes in the material. Remember, the only 100% effective way to prevent pregnancy/STD's is abstinence.
 No means no. If someone sexually harasses or assaults you, know that your college has resources to handle that.
 If you are worried you have an STD or are pregnant, some colleges even provide free or discounted services.

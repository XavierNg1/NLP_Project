 Make time in your schedule that’s specifically dedicated to paying and organizing bills every week. Either pay bills during that time or focus on filing them in such a way that you will remember to pay them before the due date.


A weekly schedule for this works best, as it’s easier to make a habit of it and ensures that you address bills that arrive and come due at different times of the month.If you have very few bills, you may set aside a time for paying bills only once or twice a month instead.
 Put your due dates or payment dates into a calendar or planner. This can be any paper or electronic one you use for all of your scheduling, or one designated specifically for bills.


Many electronic calendars like Google Docs or the local calendar application on your computer operating system can also sync up to your mail platform and detect dates within your emails, making it easy for you to simply click on it to create a new calendar entry.
In an electronic calendar, try including in the notes or details of an entry the website URL and login information for all bills that you pay online.
 Set an alarm or reminder notification on your phone or computer that will pop up on the day of or day before you need to pay a bill. Use this method particularly if you have trouble setting time aside to pay bills or look at your calendar without prompting.


Many electronic calendar applications allow you to set an alarm for any event, making it easy to schedule and remind yourself in one step.
You can also set a regular clock alarm or timer to go off when you want to set aside some time in a day to address all your bills.

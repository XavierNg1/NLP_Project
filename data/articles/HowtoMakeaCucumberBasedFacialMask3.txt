 A cucumber, egg, olive oil and vinegar mask is a good option if you want to deep-clean the skin of your face. To begin making it, wash a cucumber, then cut off a quarter of it and peel it using a vegetable peeler., Slice the cucumber quarter into a few pieces to make it easier to blend. Then drop these pieces into a food process or blender., Crack an egg into a small bowl, then use a spoon to spoon out and remove the yolk from the egg whites. Be careful not to break the yolk as you are removing it. Drop the egg yolk into the food processor and dispose of the egg whites, or save them for use in cooking., Measure out and add a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar to the food processor, as well as two tablespoons of olive oil.
 Use the puree option on your food processor or blender to mix all the ingredients for the mask. Stop when the ingredients are blended together.

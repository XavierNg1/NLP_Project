 Depending on the kind of survey you created, you will be collating it in different ways. For a survey with a spectrum (from strongly disagree to strongly agree), you can assign numerical values to each response (highest numbers are best) and tabulate quantitatively. For a longer survey with written responses, you typically group the answers together by question and then deal with each question at a time., What did you learn from the survey? Was it what you believed you would find, or not? Take the results and use them for whatever role they were intended -- from the kinds of changes people want to see in a town or city to a public health journal to changes in the way customer service is delivered. Surveys are a great way to hear from a lot of different people, so now it’s up to the survey taker to make sure the people’s voices are heard. If it was an academic survey, you can analyze your results, put them in context, and hopefully publish., Put your hard work out there. If it was a customer service survey, tell customers the changes you have made as a result. If it was a medical research survey, tell respondents about how their answers have helped change the course of your research. People like to know that their opinions and thoughts matter, and surveys can help facilitate this. You might even want to share the survey data and conclusions with your survey takers -- possibly through an email or mailing.

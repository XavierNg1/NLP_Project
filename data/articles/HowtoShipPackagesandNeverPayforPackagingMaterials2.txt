 If they don't have a box area, ask them to set aside boxes for you regularly. Always be prompt about picking them up so that they're not having to keep piles of boxes in the way.
 Always be careful about taking boxes out of bins though, as bin lids can be heavy and some jurisdictions may prevent this by law. If you visit a local recycling center, they might be happy to help out with boxes that come their way.
 After people move, they often have many spare boxes. Large moving boxes can be cut down to smaller sizes and reused in many ways as packaging.
 As long as you have storage space, keep all the boxes you bring your groceries, appliances, shoes and other purchases in. This will give you a ready supply of free boxes.


Ask neighbors, family and friends to supply you with their unwanted boxes too.

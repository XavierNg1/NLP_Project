 Whether it's you or your partner suffering from depression, it's important you both maintain friendships in addition to your partnership. The depressed partner may feel like a burden without regular breaks, and the other may begin to feel trapped. Taking a step away occasionally will help both partners feel refreshed.Scheduling weekly social activities may obligate you to engage socially. Try setting up a weekly dinner date with your best friend. This will get you out of the house, foster a supportive relationship, and give you a healthy break from your partner.
 This is a good way for you and your partner to engage others socially together. Gather with family and friends regularly to maintain relationships and focus on something other than the depression.


Consider joining a club or volunteering at a local organization together. This will provide excellent opportunities to spend time together, without focusing on the depression, and make new friends, adding to your support system.
 Seeing other people happy may actually boost your mood.At the very least, other patrons will provide a distraction and give you something to talk about.


Coffee shops tend to be great for people watching, and outside venues may also provide the added mood boosting effects of nature.

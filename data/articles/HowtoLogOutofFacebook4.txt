 Facebook Messenger does not have a "Logout" option built-in to the app. This means you'll need to use some workarounds to get your account logged out. The quickest way is to use the remote logout tool discussed in the section above. Find the "Messenger" session and end it to log out of the app.


This is the only way to sign out of Messenger on an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch.
 Another way to log out of the Android version of Messenger is to clear the app's data:Open your Android's Settings app.
Select "Apps" or "Application Manager."
Tap "Messenger" in the list of apps.
Tap the "Clear Data" button. If you don't see it, tap "Storage" first. This will log you out of the Messenger app.
 If the Facebook app on the same device as Messenger is logged in, Messenger can be logged back in with a single tap. You'll need to log out of the Facebook app as well if you don't want to make it easy to log back into Messenger.

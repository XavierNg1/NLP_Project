 The old paint should be disposed of instead of letting it contaminate the ground. If an open area is not available, park the car inside a garage, but open all of the garage's windows and doors for ventilation. Cover objects inside the garage to protect them from the paint dust.;
, Apply several layers of masking tape to chrome trim or other exterior accessories so the sandpaper doesn't scratch them. The weather stripping, tail lights, and headlights should also be covered.
 Place the sander on the surface of the car, and turn it on. The sander vibrates constantly and moves around very quickly in small circles. Keep the sander moving back and forth along the length of the vehicle to remove old paint. Moving the sander up and down can actually create imperfections in the finished paint.
 Keep the sander moving so the sheet metal on the car doesn't heat up enough to warp, which can happen if the sander is held in one place longer than several seconds.
 Change the sandpaper disk after each large panel so that the paper is not too smooth. Once finished, turn off the sander.
 Blow the paint dust out of crevices and openings such as around the bumper and below the windshield. Start at the roof and work down to the bottom of the car.

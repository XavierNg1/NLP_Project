 Rinse them under cool running water, taking care to wash away dirt and other debris. Pick out bruised or damaged chilies, since these won't keep for long periods of time. Pat the chilies dry with a paper towel before proceeding.


You might want to wear gloves to protect your hands as you handle the chilies. Hot chili peppers contain capsaicin, a chemical that burns when it gets on your skin.
Take special care not to touch your eyes or nose after handles hot chilies.;
, You can use a cooling rack or another rack that has vents to allow air circulation from below. If possible, avoid using a solid cooking sheet or tray, since the lack of air flow will make it more difficult for the peppers to dry evenly.


Put the tray in a sunny, well-ventilated room. The kitchen windowsill is a great spot.
Let them dry for three or more days, then store them in an airtight container.
 This is an easy and decorative way to dry them. Once the chilies are dry, you can keep them hanging up or store them for later use. Here's how to do it:


Thread a needle with a long piece of strong thread or fishing line. Pierce the chilies just under their caps to thread the needle through them. Do this until all of the chilies have been threaded.
Hang them in a well ventilated and sunny place in your home.
In three days to a week, theyâ€™ll be dry and ready to use.
 This is a good technique if you can't wait days, and don't want to wait for the chilies to dry out naturally. Instead of keeping the chilies whole, slicing them helps them dry evenly and quickly. Follow these simple steps:


Slice the cleaned chilies in half lengthwise.
Lay them seed-side up on a baking sheet.
Bake at 125 degrees F (or your lowest setting) for several hours. This is still a lengthy process but quicker than air drying.
You could also use a food dehydrator for quick results.

 Remove all the items from the cabinets and place them out of the way. Since most cabinets are secured directly into the walls, the work will need to be done inside the house with good ventilation.
 Set them aside in a safe place until the end of the project.
 Then, remove the drawers. You can choose to work on the doors and drawers outside in a garage, if you desire.
 This is important whether you are staining the base and wall cabinets in the home or doors and drawers in the garage.
 Apply with a sponge or a scrub pad. If possible, find a no-rinse type of TSP for easy application. Scrub well and allow it to dry completely.
 Place drop cloths over appliances if you cannot remove them.
 Buy 150 to 180-grit sandpaper and sand sponges. You are not trying to remove the stain itself; however, you are trying to create a scuffed surface for the stain to stick to.
 Remove fallen dust with a vacuum.
 Also known as surface deglosser, this liquid can be applied with rags in order to clean and create a better surface to absorb the stain. Allow it to dry for at least 1 hour.

 If you have trouble overcoming biases about people from different groups or backgrounds, reach out to others for help. Ask a friend, colleague, or mentor to help you work through your beliefs so that you can stop making racist comments.You might say, “Henry, I admire how open and accepting you are. I really need some work in this area. Can you help me?”

, Biases are often ingrained and learned at an early age. These stereotypes and prejudices can be unlearned by consciously being aware of them and educating yourself. Work with your accountability partner to learn more about the groups you are biased against.Educate yourself by reading books, watching movies, and gaining exposure to different sub-groups and cultures.
 One of the best ways to overcome racist viewpoints is to make friends from different racial groups. This way you can challenge those ingrained prejudices and biases in real life. Meeting people from different backgrounds helps you maintain perspective and expand your worldview.When you make friends, share some of your previous biases and ask them to educate you.
 You can help yourself and others change their attitudes about different racial groups by speaking out. Even when you stop making these comments yourself, you are also charged with correcting others who make them. When you hear a friend or relative make a racially-charged comment, don’t laugh or ignore the remark. Pull them aside and ask questions. Something like “What did you mean by that?” or “How would you feel if someone said that about you?” is enough to spark a conversation about the issue.

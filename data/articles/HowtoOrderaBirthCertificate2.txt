 Most states will allow you to request a birth certificate by using a paper application. You should be able to download the application from the state’s Vital Records office.
 Each state’s application will probably be slightly different. However, you should have the following information available:full name of the person whose birth record you are requesting
birth date
place of birth (town, county, state)
full name of the person’s parents
your contact information (name, phone number, mailing address, and email)
your reason for requesting the record

, In some states, you will need to sign and date the application before a notary public.You should check the application to see if this is required.


Notaries can be found at large banks, county clerk’s offices, and at the courthouse. You should bring acceptable personal identification to show the clerk, preferably a driver’s license or a passport.
Notaries may charge a small fee to notarize the document. You should call ahead and ask.
 Keep a copy of the application for your records. Then mail the application to the address provided. You can send the application certified mail, return receipt requested if you want to be notified when it is received. Otherwise you can send it standard mail.


Be sure to include your proof of identity as well as your payment.

 Take the eyelash curler in your dominant hand, and move it to the open position. Hold it up to your eye, placing it so it’s at the base of your lashes.Don’t apply mascara to your lashes before using the eyelash curler. The lashes can stick to the curler’s pads if they have makeup on them and you may wind up pulling them out when you curling.
You should hold the curler like a pair of scissors, with the curved side facing outwards.
Line up the padded strip on the bottom edge of the curler with the root of your lashes.
Make sure that all of your lashes are inside the opening between the upper and lower edge of the curler.;
, When you have the curler positioned at the base of your lashes, gently squeeze it closed, ensuring that none of your skin is pinched between the tool’s pads. Hold the curler closed on the lashes, but pulse it slowly to help with the curl.








To ensure the best curl, keep the curler closed on your lashes for 5 to 10 seconds.
 After you’ve curled your lashes at the base, open the curler and move it halfway down your lashes. Close it again, pulsing lightly to add a curl to the middle of your lashes.








Once again, be sure to keep the curler closed for at least 5 seconds to ensure a defined curl.
 Slide the eyelash curler down to the ends of your lashes. Close it, and pulse gently to curl the tips of your lashes.








By curling all the way along your lashes, you’ll get the most natural looking curl and help your eyes look wider.
 Once you’ve finished curling your lashes, apply one to two coats of a lengthening mascara. Make sure to wiggle the mascara brush back and forth at the base of your lashes to help add extra volume as well.








A waterproof mascara formula usually does a better job of helping your lashes keep their curl throughout the day.

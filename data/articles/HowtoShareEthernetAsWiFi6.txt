 Navigate to System Preferences, then select the Sharing icon.

One limitation of using this method is that you cannot host a wi-fi network and be connected to another network at the same time. You can only be connected to an ethernet cable and hosting a wireless network simultaneously.
 After you've done this, you need to select the internet connection you will be sharing. Under where it says, "Internet Sharing: Off", there is an option saying, "Share your connection from:". Choose ethernet from this list (if you'd like to use another connection, go ahead). In the “To computers using” box (underneath the "Share your connection from" option) check the Wi-Fi option., This will be how you configure your hotspot. Type in whatever network name you'd like. Then, select the desired channel and security type. WPA2-Personal is recommended for the best protection. Type in your desired password, and type it in again in the box below for verification. Click the "OK" button at the bottom of the pop up window., The pop up window will ask you "Are you sure you want to turn on internet sharing?" and provide a warning. To start the network, make sure you click "Start" and not "Cancel". You have now set up a wi-fi network!

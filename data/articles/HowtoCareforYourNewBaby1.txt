 When you pick your baby up, be sure that you are supporting the head and neck. Babies have little muscle development in this area and if they do not have support when lifted, they can become seriously injured. Lift them delicately and cradle their head as you do so.;
, Babies skulls will not fully close until they are roughly a year and a half to two years old.Until then, you will notice that there are soft spots on their head. Don’t worry too much, however. The membrane that covers these spots is very tough and your baby will be perfectly safe. You can touch these areas or comb the baby’s hair without causing any harm.
 Do not, under any circumstances, shake your baby. This will easily cause serious brain damage, spinal damage, or even kill your baby. You should not even shake them as a part of play until they have developed the muscles necessary to support this.


If you are angry with your baby (which may very well happen, they cry a lot) and you are concerned that you feel the need to shake the baby or do something violent to make it be quiet, please seek help. Ask a friend or parent to watch the baby or give you advice until you calm down. Sleep deprivation is a harsh mistress.

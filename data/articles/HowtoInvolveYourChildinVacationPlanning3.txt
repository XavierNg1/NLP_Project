 Establish ahead of time how much your family can afford to spend on this vacation. This is a decision you will have to make yourself without the input of the child. Some costs you will want to factor in when budgeting:Cost of travel
Hotel room rates per night
Meals for each person
Tickets to attractions

, Assign an activity to your child, and tell them how much money you have to spend on it. Encourage them to research and plan the activity in a way that fits your budget.For example, you might ask them to plan a trip to the zoo for the family. The child will have to add up the cost of tickets, look for discounts, set aside extra money for snacks, and decide if any money is left over for souvenirs.
Your child may need a little guidance with this activity. Offer to sit next to them, and give them advice on how to find the right information.
 If your child is struggling with the budget, sit down and talk to them about how they must make trade-offs. Doing one activity might prevent them from doing another. This is a good way to teach the child important budgeting skills.For example, you might say, “If we go to the theme park, we won’t be able to go the museum, see a show, or go ice skating. Is it worth it to do one expensive activity or multiple cheaper activities?”

, Talk to your child about saving money for the trip. This money might go towards snacks or souvenirs that they want to buy for themselves. You may want to tell them to put away ten or twenty percent of their allowance into their savings each week.


You can use a piggy bank that they can store their coins or cash in.
You can make a shadow box to encourage them to save. Put a picture of your vacation destination in the shadow box, and cut a slit for money. As they deposit money, they will see their savings build up.

 One of the more popular options is "Burn," a free, open-source DVD burning program that can burn video files to playable DVDs. This program does not come with any junkware, and no one profits from you installing it.


You can download Burn from burn-osx.sourceforge.net/.
Double-click the "Burn.zip" file that is downloaded to your computer to extract the "Burn" folder.
Drag the "Burn" application to your Applications folder. You may be prompted to enter your password. This will install Burn.;
, Highlight the project in your iMovie Library. Press âŒ˜ Command+A to select the entire video.
 This will open a menu allowing you to adjust your sharing settings.
 Although there may be higher resolutions available, DVDs display in SD (480p). Saving the video file in any higher resolution will result in wasted space.
 It may take a while for iMovie to create the file. To make it easier to find the file later, save it to your desktop.
 You'll see the tabs along the top of the Burn window.
 This menu is towards the top of the window, to the right of the DVD name.
 Find the file that you created from iMovie and drag it into the Burn "File" list.


Click "Convert" if prompted. Burn will convert video files that are not compatible into a format that works.
 This will enable a basic menu system for your DVD. You can skip this step, and the video will begin playing immediately once you insert it.
 You'll need a blank DVD to burn to. DVD-R is the most compatible format for DVD players., Select your DVD drive if it is not already selected, then click "Burn" again.
 The time the burn process takes depends on the length of the movie and the speed of your DVD drive.
 Your DVD can now be played on most DVD drives. While it should work in many DVD players, be aware that some older players may not recognize burnt discs.

 In order to educate others about UNICEF's charitable initiatives, you should deepen your own knowledge about the humanitarian organization. Visit https://www.unicefusa.org/mission to read the organization's mission statement, as well as descriptions of its current initiatives in over 190 countries across the world. UNICEF's efforts include:providing immunizations for 45% of the world's children
giving access to clean, safe water in over 100 countries
prevention of mother-to-child transmission of the HIV virus
educational initiatives that can include building schools, training teachers, bringing education to child refugees, and reforming school systems
emergency relief to victims of war and natural disasters

, Start educating people about UNICEF on a small scale, starting with your own inner-circle (i.e. friends and family) and co-workers. Garner interest by sharing facts about UNICEF's work, noting specific, individual examples. When it comes to charity, "identifiable victims" elicit a greater level of emotion and sympathy than statistics about a great number of people do.For example, you could show friends, family, or colleagues a picture of Rukaia, a one-year old baby whose family fled the city of Aleppo, receiving new winter clothing from UNICEF to stay warm as temperatures drop;this picture, and others like it, are available via the UNICEF U.S. Fund Instagram account.
 Follow UNICEF on any social media platforms that you use (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube). The internet is arguably the fastest way to share knowledge and news, so put your online time to good use by sharing information about UNICEF and its global initiatives. For instance, share posts from UNICEF USA's Facebook page on your own wall to be viewed by your Facebook friends.


Make use of the visual storytelling, hashtags, and calls to action that UNICEF employs in their social media activity, which are effective tools in spreading awareness about the organization and its work.

 Ask you parents if you can have a yard sale. You probably have old toys, games and clothes that you have outgrown or don’t use anymore. Selling these items is an easy way to make money and it can make your room or closet a lot less cluttered too! Don’t have a yard sale without your parents’ permission. Ask and arrange details with them.
Set fair prices for your items. You may want to make a lot of money, but if your items are overpriced then you will have a hard time selling anything.
A lot of neighborhoods also have block yard sales. See if your neighborhood is having an event like this sometime soon.
 Tell your friends and your classmates about any items that you are selling. For instance, if your friends are talking about video games, tell them that you have a video game that you are selling. Word of mouth is a great way to sell your unwanted items.
 Use Ebay or other online sites to sell unwanted items like old toys and clothes or crafts. You will need assistance from your parents when selling items on Ebay, but it can be a great way of reaching buyers from outside your community. Be careful when talking to potential customers online. Don’t give out your full name or any other personal information.

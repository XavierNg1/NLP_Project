 If you do not clean the castle up you will be tortured. Do a certain amount of time. Write the time down and then next time you clean your room you can try to beat it.
 You take all the covers off the bed. Then you flip the mattress over. after you do that you can put on clean sheets. that will be making the base of the food. then the more blankets and covers you put on there the better it tastes. By putting on the covers, you add spices.
 It will take time to get a good tune. You can get your older brother or sister play some music to go along with you song. You can also put on your headphones and listen to your iPod or MP3 player.

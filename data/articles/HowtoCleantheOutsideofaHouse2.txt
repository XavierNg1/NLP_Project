 You can buy a siding cleaning kit with a nozzle attachment from your local home improvement store. Or, you can buy an automobile brush that will attach to your hose. You can use only water to clean if your house isnâ€™t heavily soiled. If it is, you will need to use a cleanser. A siding kit should come with a compartment to pour the cleanser into the attachment.You can find cleanser specifically made for washing the outside of houses at most home improvement stores.
 Spray your hose at a downward angle. Work from the bottom to the top of the house. Work in small, separate sections at a time., If you used more than water, you will need to rinse off the cleanser. Again, work from top to bottom as you rinse off the house with only water. You do not need to do anything to dry off the house.

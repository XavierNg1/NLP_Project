 Perhaps you get attention, perhaps it's just fun to be cheeky or perhaps you are covering up an inability to do something. In some cases, you may have found it has been easier to be a bully than to reach out and get help for the reasons you're lashing out at innocent people. Whatever the reason, try to identify what is motivating your bad behavior.
 Even if you've been getting away with bad behavior, you'll already have a reputation and eventually, even the patient people will get tired of your behavior.
 It's really as simple as that. While it may feel odd, by no longer doing the badly behaved things, you can move on. People may say things to remind you of what you used to do, but simply say that's how you used to be, that you've thought about it and have changed things. You don't need to make up any excuses, just move on.
 If you're finding it hard to stop behaving badly, seek help from someone you trust. This might be a teacher, a parent/guardian, a friend, a counselor, a person of faith, or any other person you trust. Explain what you're going through and see how they can help you move past it.
 If you've hurt people as a result of your behavior, it can be a good way to start over by apologizing to them. Do not expect them to be convinced by your apology or to believe that you've mended your ways, simply be genuine in your own intention and move on. You will prove to these people that you mean your apology through your future actions towards them.
 Do all the things outlined above to improve academically and start filling your life with external activities that you enjoy, such as sport, a hobby or chatting to friends. Don't linger over what was. Look forwards.

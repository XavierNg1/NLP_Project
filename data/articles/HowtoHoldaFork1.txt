 Most European eaters keep the knife in their right hand for cutting, and they keep the fork in their left hand for eating. In the American style, eaters switch the fork over to their right hand to eat the pieces that they have cut. Traditionally, this is the main difference between the European and American forking styles. The European style is often considered more efficient because you don't have to remove the fork from you hand until you are done eating.








If you're setting the table for "European-style" eating: make sure to arrange the fork on the left-hand side of the plate, and the knife on the right-hand side.;
, This is traditional European etiquette. Be aware, however, that many modern Europeans not longer pay much heed to which way their tines are facing.Hold the handle between your thumb and your middle, ring, and pinky fingers. Place your index finger at the end of the handle where it meets the base of the fork tines. Let the end of the handle rest in the crease of your palm.









The lower you place your index finger on the fork handle, the more leverage you'll have as you eat your food.
 Hold it in your hand in the same closed-fist manner that you hold your fork. Use it to rake the food onto your fork. Fold or push the food onto the tines of your fork with your knife if it is a salad or soft food. Use a gentle sawing motion with the knife if you are cutting meat, pizza or a similar food. You can actually push more food securely onto your fork with the European method than with the scooping American method.
 Insert the fork into your mouth with the tines still scooping down. Don’t turn the fork or put it into your right hand. When you are finished, rest your fork and knife parallel on the plate with the tines facing down. If you see the plate as a clock face: the tines and blade should be at 10 o’clock, and the handles at 4 o’clock.

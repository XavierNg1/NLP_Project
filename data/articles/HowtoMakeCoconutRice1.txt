 Place 2 cups of basmati rice in a colander or sieve and rinse the rice under running, cold water until the water is clear. Just make sure the rice doesn't actually fall through the sieve. You can place the sieve over a bowl to catch any of the rice that may fall out.;
, When you're done, add it to a saucepan with the cup of coconut milk, 3 cups of water, and the tablespoon of sea salt.
 Stir it occasionally to keep the rice from clumping together.
 If the water is absorbed really quickly and the rice is still hard, then you can add a little bit more water to the mixture and keep stirring it to make it more fluffy.
 Serve the rice on its own, or pair it with beef, chicken, or a vegetable mixture.

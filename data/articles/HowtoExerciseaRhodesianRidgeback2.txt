 Playing fetch, a classic game loved by most dogs, employs your dog’s natural instinct to chase and retrieve. While keeping your Rhodesian Ridgeback active is important, it is also important to keep it engaged and mentally stimulated; when bored, this breed can get into trouble (e.g. digging up plants or trees in the backyard). Use one of your dog’s favorite toys to play fetch with, like a rubber ball or squeak toy.
 For a fun game that will keep your dog active indoors, try setting up blanket hurdles. Clear as much space as you can in the living room, basement, or other venue and create a small obstacle course with rolled up blankets or other safe objects (e.g. plastic toys, pillows). Walk your dog through the course a few times until it is familiar with it, then have it run through the course from one side of the room to the other.Once your dog gets used to the course, add a few blankets or pillows to increase the challenge.
 While soccer may sound like an odd choice of game to play with your dog, it is an excellent activity to try with your Rhodesian Ridgeback. Use a large sized rubber ball that will be difficult for your dog to pick up with its mouth; avoid any balls that will be easy to puncture or deflate. To play, kick the ball and let your dog chase it; let him play for it for a minute once he catches up to it, then gently take it back and kick it again.To make the ball more desirable, try smearing a dab of peanut butter on it.
 Tag is an excellent game to play with a dog who is comfortable enough with you to engage with you physically. The game is not a very structured one, but instead involves running, chasing, dodging, and being silly. Play tag in a fenced-in yard or park to ensure that your dog does not run off too far or get lost during play.

 Get a 5-gallon (18.92 l) bucket with an accompanying roller screen from the hardware store or online. Screens will come with two hooks that you can use to hang the screen on the lip of your bucket. Hang the screen so that it hangs on the inside of the bucket.Sometimes buckets will come with the roller screen attached.
 Carefully fill the bucket halfway with paint and make sure that at least half of the roller screen is out of the bucket., Dip the roller 1/2 in. (1.27 cm) into the paint. Use the roller screen to guide your paint roller as you dip it into the paint. You don't want to dip the roller too deep into the bucket, or you'll get paint on the side of your roller., Once you've saturated the roller with paint, you should roll it up against the roller screen. The paint should be dripping off the roller and back into the bucket as you do this., Continue dipping the roller slightly into the water before rolling it onto your screen. Once your roller is fully saturated, you're ready to paint.

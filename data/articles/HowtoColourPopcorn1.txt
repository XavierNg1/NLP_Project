 If you want a classic caramel corn taste with a twist, this recipe is for you. It results in fresh-tasting, crunchy popcorn with a sweet and salty flavour combo that's always a hit. You can dye it any colour you want using liquid food colouring. Here's what you'll need:


1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon canola oil
1/4 cup corn syrup
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon liquid food colouring
1/3 cup of popcorn kernels;
, Place the butter, oil, syrup and salt in a large pot. Melt the ingredients together until they're completely combined. Stir occasionally to incorporate the ingredients.
 Stir in 1/4 teaspoon of liquid food colouring. If you want the popcorn to have a deeper colour, add more; for a pastel colour, add less. Use a spoon to mix the food colouring in thoroughly.
 Pour 1/3 cup of popcorn kernels into the pot and stir them around so they're coated in the syrup mixture. Put a tight-fitting lid on the pot and turn the heat to medium high. Shake the pot every few moments as the kernels heat up and begin to pop. When the popping begins to slow down, remove the pot from heat.









If you want to use the microwave instead. pour the syrup mixture and popcorn kernels into a glass microwave-safe bowl with a lid. Pop the popcorn on high for three to four minutes, or until the popping slows to a stop. Do not use a plastic bowl, even if it's microwave safe, since the syrup will get very hot and could scorch the bowl. Be sure to use a glass one.
 You can oil the baking sheet or line it with parchment paper so the popcorn won't stick. Spread it into a thin, single layer and allow it to cool completely. The popcorn will get crispy as it cools. Enjoy immediately or store in an airtight container.

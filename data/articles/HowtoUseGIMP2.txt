 When GIMP opens, it has to load several data files. This process can take a few minutes. When it is finished loading, several windows will appear on your screen. On the left side is the Toolbox. On the right side is the Layers menu. The middle window is where images will open.
 To start on a blank image, click the File menu in the center window and select New. The Create a New Image window will open, asking you what you would like the image size to be. You can set the size manually or select from the preset templates using the dropdown menu.


Click OK and your new image will open. Your cursor will change to the Pen tool and you can begin drawing. Use the Layers and Brushes menu to adjust the brush type.
 Click File, then Open. Browse for the image that you want to edit. Once you select the file, the image will open in a new window.

 Almost all routers can be accessed through a web interface where you can see and adjust settings. Open the web interface by entering the router’s IP address into a web browser. Check your router’s documentation for the specific address. The most common router addresses are:


192.168.1.1
192.168.0.1
192.168.2.1

, The location of the external IP address will vary from router to router. Most have it listed in the Router Status or WAN (Wide Area Network) Status.Under Internet Port in the Router Status, your IP address should be listed. The IP address is 4 sets of digits, with up to three digits per set.
This is the IP address of your router. Any connections made out of your router will have this address.
This IP address is assigned to you by your internet service provider. Most external IP addresses are dynamic, which means they change from time to time. This address can be masked using proxies.
 The first result displayed will be your external, or public, IP address.

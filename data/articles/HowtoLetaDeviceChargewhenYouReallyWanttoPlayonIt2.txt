 Call up your best friend, or send him/her an email. Tell them that you are bored, and need suggestions for what to do. Your bestie will probably jump right over an opportunity to humour you.
 Tell your parents that you are bored, and ask them to play a game with you. Chances are, your parents would be happy to play a game with you while your device is charging.
 Invite a friend over. Your friend will want to help you out and have fun, so your peers will probably respect you and try to humour you.

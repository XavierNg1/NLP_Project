 Some dresses have lace or other types of embellishment on their skirts, so make sure they don’t fall at the wrong place.Petite brides may look best in trumpet shapes, sheath gowns, column dresses and narrow A-line cuts. Textures work well, but avoid ornate embellishments.Also avoid drop-waists and calf-length designs as they will make your legs look shorter.
Taller brides may prefer to choose bias cut or sheath dresses. Strapless dresses are also appropriate.Always make sure the sleeves and skirt are long enough to complement your body's proportions.
 These allow the dress to skim your body and give definition to your waist, helping to flatter your curves.Avoid pleating and oversized and/or unfitted gowns, which will visually add weight to your figure.
 A curved neckline will frame your face and collarbone and make your bust area a supporting feature. Avoid strapless gowns with straight horizontal necklines as well as fabrics with sheen and ruching; they will make you appear heavier up top. Going strapless is possible for you. Just pick a built-in corset or boning to help keep your dress from slipping., If you’re curvier, go for a nipped waist with a skirt that falls loosely over your thighs and calves.

 When you travel, you can take melatonin to help with jet lag, which is daytime fatigue that occurs when changing time zones. The first night you arrive at your destination, you can take 0.5 to 5 mg of melatonin. Taking it can help you sleep and reset your sleeping patterns to match the new time zone you traveled to. Continue taking for two to five nights.


Lower doses, such as 0.5 to 3 mg, are recommended to avoid the sedating side effects that can sometimes be caused at higher doses.

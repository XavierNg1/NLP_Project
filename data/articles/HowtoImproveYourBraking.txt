 A dirt parking lot or short grass field is ideal.;
, These make your target stopping line. You should have plenty of room to ride straight at the gap between them to build up speed, and you should have plenty of space on the other side of them in case you don't stop right on the line.
 Stop pedaling and coast with both feet level. Squeeze both brake levers and try to stop with your front wheel perfectly on the line (center of the wheel between the cones). If either wheel skids, release some pressure on the appropriate brake lever. Repeat several times building up speed. You should have a good idea of where you need to start applying your brakes in order to stop on the line.
 You will need more stopping distance, so go back to your original speed. Practice until you can stop on the line consistently using only your back brake.
 Again, start slow and work up. It is very important that you not lock-up (skid) your front wheel. Practice this until you can stop consistently on the line.
 You will find you can stop in a much more controlled manner than you could before.
 The motion is much like a very fast push-up. This momentarily increases the force on your front tire, giving the tire more grip. With more grip you can brake harder without locking your tires.
, This allows your legs to take much of force instead of your arms. This will let you ride longer without getting tired, as well as give you better control of the bike while braking.

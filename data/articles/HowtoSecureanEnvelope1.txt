 Placing a seal over the envelope flap is a great way to provide some extra security. Seals specifically designed for envelopes will be difficult to remove and place back on. Therefore, if someone does open the envelope, the broken seal will be proof.


You can find these seals at any office supply store. A regular sticker won’t stick to the paper as well as a postal seal.;
, Envelopes with a clasp, strip removal, or string are less likely to open on their own. They can be found at an office supply store.


These envelopes may still be opened intentionally so you’ll want another security mechanism if you’re concerned about this.
 A very old-fashioned way of securing envelopes is to drip melted wax over the flap and let it dry. A wax seal will make it virtually impossible to open the envelope without ripping it. You can find sealing wax at any stationary store and most office supply stores.Most sealing wax comes in bars with a wick in the middle, much like a candle. Light the wick and hold the bar over the flap until a small amount of wax accumulates. The appropriate amount of wax should be able the size of a quarter.
Some sealing wax comes in small pellets. Place one in a microwave-safe dish and nuke it for about 30 second. Then slowly drip it over the flap.
You could also purchase a seal stamp that leaves a distinctive shape in the wax.
 If you don’t have a seal, you can use scotch or masking tape to secure the envelope. Double-sided tape is most ideal.You can also use any household adhesive like rubber cement or crafts glues.


If you only have one-sided tape, fold it back on itself so that the sticky side is pointing out.
 A lesser known solution is to apply nail polish to the adhesive strip rather than licking it or wetting it with a sponge. Nail polish won’t wear off if someone tries to steam the envelope open. Use the brush that comes with the nail polish to gloss a thin layer over the adhesive strip.

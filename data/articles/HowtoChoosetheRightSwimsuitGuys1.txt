 If you are buying a suit for racing competitively, you’ll need a different suit than you would if you’re just swimming for fun. The more leg movement (i.e., actual swimming) you intend to do, the less fabric you should have on your swimsuit., If you want to really impress, think carefully about your build and research what sort of swimsuit looks best on someone with your body type. Different body types will look better with different colors, suit lengths, and patterns.If you are buying a men’s swimsuit for a pool party with coworkers but still want to look professional, choose something in a dark color – either striped or in a solid color – that ends in the middle of the thigh.
If you are not worried about looking cool, just buy any color or pattern you want.
 Different swimsuits are priced differently. You can pick up a basic suit for about $20, a mid-range suit for around $50 to $100, and a deluxe swimsuit for $300 or more. More expensive suits, generally, will be more durable.If you're buying your first swimsuit, you should get something on the budget end. This will give you a better sense of your needs and what you like in a suit.
If you intend to do serious swimming, then your suit will get a lot of wear. You might want to spend a little extra to get a nicer swimsuit.

 Shaving is the most basic method to get rid of body hair. You can buy a razor and shaving cream in most grocery stores, pharmacies, and even gas stations. Shaving is a fast and painless way to get rid of hair, however it doesn't prevent hair from growing back.


Unlike waxing, shaving does not hurt, but because of the sharp blades from the razor, you can cut yourself frequently.
Shaving only lasts for up to a week, until the hair is visible again. Some hair grows back within 1-2 days.;
, Open the pores to ensure a smooth shave by either submersing the skin to be shaved in a hot bath or taking a hot shower. If you shave as part of your shower routine, wait until the end (making sure the water is hot at least a few minutes before you begin) to begin shaving.
 Apply shaving cream/gel liberally to the area you intend to shave and wait a few minutes for it to set in. This time is critical to ensure the skin is properly lubricated to protect against the razor. Cover the entire area you want to shave.
 Slowly run the razor across your hair. After 5-6 inches, rinse off the shaving cream and hair and repeat. Slowly (as slowly as you can) shave and with each stroke, wash the blade under hot water. Continue until your skin is smooth.


Make sure not to press to hard on your skin. Lightly graze it.
 You must moisturize to maintain your skin! Shaving removes the most superficial layer so skin is extra-sensitive to damage, but also will absorb moisture better, so take advantage of the time. Use moisturizers with vitamin E or shea butter to help soothe skin and keep it looking young.


If you need extra protection against razor burn, use an astringent cream or oil (usually containing an analgesic) to prevent irritation.

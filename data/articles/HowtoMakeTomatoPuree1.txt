If you are planning on storing the puree for a long period, be sure to follow proper preserving guidelines, such as creating a proper acidic balance, reheating to a boil before storage and using clean storage jars to avoid bacteria growth.
Another way to store the puree is to freeze it in an ice cube tray and store the frozen puree cubes in a bag in your freezer. This takes up less space and allows you to access varying amounts of puree as needed.

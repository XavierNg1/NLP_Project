 There is a blood test that can show if a dog has been exposed to Borrelia or not. However, this is of limited use because a positive result shows a low tie-up with those that go on to develop clinical disease. Perhaps the test is most useful when it comes back negative, because a dog with a negative titre (reading) cannot have Lyme's disease.
 One diagnostic avenue to pursue is to rule out other conditions which may cause similar symptoms. Thus central nervous system (CNS) fluid may be analyzed to check for meningitis, and joint fluid to rule out joint infections.
 Once your dog has gotten a prescription for oxytetracycline antibiotics, you should be a massive improvement within 2 4 to 48 hours. Because of this, many vets choose to treat the dog for Lymeâ€™s disease, even if they are positive that this is the condition the dog has.


If your sick dog with relevant signs is a lot better the day after starting antibiotics then it is highly likely the condition was Lyme's disease.

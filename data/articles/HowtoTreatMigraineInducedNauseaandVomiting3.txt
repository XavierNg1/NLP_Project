 Acupuncture is known as an alternative treatment for easing a migraine and its symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.


Acupuncture is done through the insertion of extremely thin needles at strategic points around the body. Furthermore, acupuncture encourages tranquility and relaxes the person suffering from cluster headaches.
The points that need to be stimulated for nausea and vomiting include the following: foot yang ming, ST 36 (lower he-sae), ST 25, PC 6, Ren 10 (pyloric sphincter, digestion), Li Nei Ting (digestion, under ST 44).
 Acupressure is a Chinese healing art. It uses the fingers to apply pressure to key points. Just like acupuncture, its purpose is to enhance the flow of energy in the body. Here are a few acupressure points.



Ocean of energy: This point is located a finger width under the belly button. Massaging this area can relieve stomach discomfort.

Inner gate:This point is situated on the inside of the wrist, two and a half finger widths beneath the crease. Stimulating this spot by applying pressure using your thumb can help with the nausea and vomiting.

Sea of vitality: This point is located on the lower back, at the waist, between two and four finger widths on either side of the spine.

 This will scroll down the page; you should see an option entitled "Up Next" with two buttons next to it.
 This is the option with two arrows pointing in opposite directions; when you tap it, it should become highlighted in red, meaning that your playlist will repeat without ending.


You can also enable "Shuffle" from here by tapping the button with two intertwined arrows.

 Like using a humidifier, exposing yourself to a steamy environment brings moisture to dry mucus membranes. Use this as an excuse to take a long, hot, steamy shower from time to time.


Another steaming method is to boil a pot of water, remove it from the heat, place a towel over your head, and lean over the steaming pot. Check to make sure the steam isn’t too hot first.;
, Salt kills germs in the mouth and throat and helps to relieve dryness and irritation. Gargling with salt couple times a day will help to soothe a dry throat.Add 1 teaspoon of salt to a cup of water.
Gargle 1-2 times a day for 30-60 seconds each time.
Don't swallow the water after gargling.
Some people also gargle with an apple cider vinegar solution (1 tablespoon per cup of water).It won’t taste great, but it may work for you.
 This one tastes better than saltwater or cider vinegar at least!


Along with the coating properties of its thick texture, honey also has antiseptic properties.No wonder bees love it.
 Sucking on lozenges or hard candies, as well as chewing gum, help stimulate saliva production, which can in turn soothe a dry throat.Stick to sugar-free versions -- your dentist will thank you.
 Most people find that warm liquids provide a soothing effect, so low-caffeine tea, perhaps with honey and lemon, can prove a good choice for dry throat relief.


Common herbal teas like chamomile can provide relief, but some people swear by teas made from ingredients like peppermint, ginger, cloves, licorice root, marshmallow root, echinacea, and slippery elm.

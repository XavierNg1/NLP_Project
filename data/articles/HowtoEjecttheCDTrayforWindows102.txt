 If your cannot find a pinhole underneath your CD drive, you may need to open the CD drive internally. Turning off your computer will stop the disk from spinning and make it safe to open the drive.,, It should release, moving to the "Off" setting.
 To do so:


Use a screwdriver to loosen the screws on the side of the computer.
Press lightly on the panel and slide it towards the rear of the computer.
Pull the panel off of the computer.
 You should see a power cable connecting it to the inside of the computer.
 Wait at least five seconds.
 If your CD drive will not open, it may be an issue with its power source. Try replacing the cable that plugs into the back of the drive.


If you cannot find another free power cable, try reattaching the original power cord into the drive after unplugging it.
 If the drive's power source prevented it from ejecting, it will now be rectified.

 You may have success in removing much of the Vaseline by soaking it up with an absorbent paper towel. Starting off with less product in your hair can make it easier to remove the remaining petroleum jelly--because it is so difficult to get out, you will probably have to repeat your method of choice several times to remove all the petroleum jelly. Soaking some of it up may reduce the number of treatments you have to give your hair.You can use a hand-held hair dryer (or a hood hair dryer if you have access to one) to heat up and liquefy the Vaseline. It may be easier to absorb it with the paper towels in this state.;
, If you have thick globs of Vaseline tangling up your hair, combing it out may remove some of the product. Make sure you wipe off the comb after each stroke so you're not just spreading it around your hair.You may want to follow up the combing by squeezing your hair with a paper towel. This will absorb even more of the petroleum jelly still in your hair.

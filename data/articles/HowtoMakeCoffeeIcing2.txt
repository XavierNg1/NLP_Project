 Measure out your instant coffee and put it into a small cup. Add the vanilla extract and pour in the water. Mix everything with a spoon until the coffee granules are dissolved.
 You can use a handheld mixer or even a food processor with a whisk attachment. Use a medium speed. You will need to beat the butter for about one minute until it achieves the right consistency.
 This will prevent the sugar from flying out everywhere. Keep beating the mixture until it becomes smooth. Keep mixing for a few more minutes.
 Make sure that the instant coffee has cooled completely before you add it in, or it will melt the butter. You may have to scrape down the sides of the bowl from time to time with a spatula to ensure that everything gets mixed together.
 At this point, you can spread the coffee buttercream on top of cakes, cupcakes, or cookies. You can also store it in an airtight container for about a week.

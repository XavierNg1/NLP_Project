 Start collecting some new weapons (not that slow-loading Desert Eagle you found).;
, Usually unsuspecting Campers zoom in at Close View, and become unaware of their surroundings. They can easily be sent to the spawn point with nothing but a quick Knife.
 Unless that group is a group of your friends, the so-called group that agreed not to pwn you could suddenly be holding Fast Rocket Launchers!

, Some good places are some empty stores or the edge of the arena. I choose any tower. If there is one person there or two, hide behind something and fire at them.
 If you have an empty M-16, and there's been a noob following you, hide behind a tree and wait for him to come so you can kill him.
 If you have a same camo suit and the same M-16, stay beside him and wait for an unsuspecting noob. This may not work for noobs who check the display on your head.
 Create a VIP room where there's a one-way glass tower and a bunch of sniper rifles, machine guns, and Fast Rocket Launchers.
 If you've been collecting those Sniper Rifles, find an empty tower and snipe like there's no tomorrow!

, Avoid getting killed by using the super jump tool.
 Its the best way to keep living.

Products have now been expanded to include rose gold and silver mica formulas. Just like the original gold version, these can be used on all hair types and colors. However, you can also gear your choice toward accentuating your hair color.For example, strawberry blondes and red heads can emphasize their strands with rose gold formulas.
Ash browns and other dark, cool tones can be accentuated by using the silver mica formulas.

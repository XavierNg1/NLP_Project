Collect a cadantine herb. Invest in clean cadantine for faster times or if you are planning to make a huge batch. Grimy cadantines are a drop of certain NPCs and monsters, as well as farming.
Purchase a vial. Acquire water-filled vial packs to save you time. Any unused vials can be stored in your bank for later usage.
Collect a white berry. You can purchase them from the Grand Exchange, killing certain monsters, farmed (if the player has a level 59 farming), or found in the Red Dragon Isle of the Wilderness.
 This will create a "Cadantine Potion (unf)".
 This will create a three dose super defence potion.

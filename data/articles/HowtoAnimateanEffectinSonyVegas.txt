 To do this, simply right click the video clip you want to edit and select "Video Event FX" on the drop-box. A larger box will come up; select the effect you want by clicking one and clicking "OK".;
, For example, taking the swirl effect, if you want the starting swirl start at the top-right, select the small, white circle on the area map, and drag it to the top-right, where you want it to be located currently.
 Say you want that swirl previously mentioned to move the lower left in five seconds. You would drag the ticker across the timeline to the five second mark, where the changes will stop.
 This is basically the same as step two, only this time, the settings you choose for this point will be the ones you end up with.

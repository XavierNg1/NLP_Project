 Windows' default firewall program is located in the "System and Security" folder of the Control Panel app, but you can easily access your firewall's settings by using the Start menu's search bar.


You can also tap the âŠž Win key to do this.;
, Doing so will automatically search your computer for applications matching your typing.
 You should see this at the top of the search window.
 You should see two sections entitled "Private networks" and "Guest or public networks" with green shields to the left of them, signifying that your firewall is active.


Clicking on either of these sections will prompt a drop-down menu with details about your current private or public networks.
 This is to the left of the main menu; clicking it will open your firewall's advanced settings menu, from which you can view or alter the following:


"Inbound Rules" - Which incoming connections are automatically allowed.
"Outbound Rules" - Which outgoing connections are automatically allowed.
"Connection Security Rules" - Baselines for which connections your computer will allow and which ones it will block.
"Monitoring" - An overview of your firewall's basic monitoring guidelines.
 You have successfully checked your PC's firewall settings!


Note that you can also click the "Turn Windows Firewall on or off" in the same option menu in which you found Advanced Settings. Be wary of disabling your firewall, especially when connected to a public network.

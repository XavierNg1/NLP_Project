 Add 4 tablespoons (52 g) of refined coconut oil to a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave the oil on high for 15 seconds. After it’s heated, stir it well to see if it’s liquified. If not, repeat the process until the oil is completely melted.If you don’t want to use a microwave, place the bowl with the coconut oil in a larger bowl filled with hot water. Let it sit in the hot water bath for several minutes, stirring every so often, until the oil is melted.
 Once the coconut oil is melted, add ½ cup (50 g) of unsweetened cocoa powder to the bowl. Mix well so the two ingredients are completely blended., When the coconut oil and cocoa powder are combined, add 1 to 4 teaspoons (5 to 20 ml) of chocolate-flavored liquid stevia. Mix the ingredients well so they’re fully blended.Start out with just a teaspoon (5 ml) of the chocolate-flavored liquid stevia and taste the sauce. If it isn’t as sweet as you’d like, mix in more until the sauce reaches the sweetness level that you want.
You can usually find chocolate-flavored liquid stevia at health food stores and natural grocery stores. It’s also available at a variety of online retailers.
 When the sauce is completely mixed, transfer it to an airtight jar. To use it, spoon it over your favorite ice cream and wait at least 30 seconds for the sauce to harden into a shell before eating.You can store the sauce at room temperature, where it will keep for about 2 to 3 months.
The sauce can last up to 6 months in the refrigerator, but it will also solidify at colder temperatures. If you're plan to store it in the fridge, reheat for 30 seconds in the microwave before pouring it over ice cream.

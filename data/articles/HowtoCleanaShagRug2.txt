 On a hard floor, flip the run facedown so that the backing is exposed. Never run a vacuum on the shag part of the rug with a standard powerhead, as it can damage the fibers of the rug., Move your vacuum slowly back and forth in straight lines going across the width of the rug. The sucking mechanism will remove a lot of dirt while the beater bar of the vacuum will knock more dirt loose onto the floor. Vacuum a second time lengthwise, crossing your first set of passes.Vacuuming the underside of the rug works because dirt settles down past the fibers into the base layer or backing of the rug.
Vacuum your rug once a week to keep it in good condition. Rugs kept in rooms where people rarely walk can be vacuumed every two weeks.
 Roll the rug up and set it aside. Then run your vacuum over the floor area where the rug was lying. This will pick up any dirt and debris that was shaken out of the rug onto the floor.If you don’t want to run your vacuum on your hard floor, use a broom and dust pan to pick up any dirt remaining on the floor.
 Lay the rug out again, this time with the shag side up. Using the vacuum’s hose with a brush or upholstery attachment, brush straight lines up and down the rug. This will remove any dirt or debris that was loosened during the first vacuuming stage. Brush the carpet gently and do not brush in circles.

 If you are lending to an individual, you may wish to secure your promissory note with some of that person’s personal property. Personal property can be anything that is not a motor vehicle or real estate. This could include anything of sufficient value, such as a big screen television, bank accounts, valuable antiques, or anything else you identify., To attach the loan to any personal property, you will need to have the borrower complete a financing statement, which is sometimes also referred to as a “UCC” or “UCC-1” statement. A sample UCC-1 is available at http://www.fullertonlaw.com/docs/appendices/17-UCC-1_financial_statement.pdf.The financing statement requires you to provide the borrower’s name and address, the lender’s name and address, and a description of the collateral. The description must be specific enough to identify the property for any third party.
 To perfect a security interest in personal property, the most common method is to file the loan documents with the secretary of state’s office in the state where the borrower resides. Depending on the laws of your state, you may also need to file in the county clerk’s office or in some other location. You should check with an attorney or the secretary of state to verify the filing requirements for your state.As with business loans, you may also perfect your security interest by taking possession or control over the collateral. If using one of these methods, you must do so in a peaceful and lawful manner. You may not break in to someone’s home to take possession of any property or take any action that causes a public disturbance.

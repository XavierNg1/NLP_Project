 What good things do you do for yourself and the people around you? Do you volunteer for your neighborhood? Then you would be known as a helpful person. Do you listen and help people about their problems? Then you are an understanding person.;
, Write down onto paper the good things about yourself. Some ideas are "I am creative" or "I can lead" or "I am organised". This way you can look at all those fantastic things about yourself and be proud of them. When you know what you are good at, you can improve yourself from there.
 Do you have low self-confidence? Are you bad at trying new things because you are scared? Now that you know what your weaknesses are, you can improve yourself from there. If you have low self-confidence, present in front of an audience about something you are good at and ask them to tell you what you need to do better, for example eye contact with the audience, interact with people more.
 If you have any spare time, take on a sport or hobby that you are bad at and make yourself better at it. If you can't swim, go to swimming classes or just watch videos and learn. Remember, Practice Makes Perfect!

, Don't copy other people and be fake. Do what you think is best because you are the best at being YOU.

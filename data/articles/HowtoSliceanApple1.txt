 The apple should rest upright on its own, but you may need hold it steady to ensure a clean cut.;
, Hold a sharp knife in your dominant hand. Slightly offset the blade from the stem so that you avoid slicing through the core. Try, however, to cut as close to the core as possible.Once the knife is in place, apply force to push the blade straight down to the cutting board. Slice through all the sides of the apple until only the core remains.Cut the apple into thirds or quarters â€“ whichever is easiest for you. Quarters will preserve more of the edible apple around the core, but thirds may take slightly less time to cut., Compost the core, if possible.If you don't have access to a compost bin, put the core into the garbage.


Feel free to nibble away any remaining apple that clings to the core. Avoid eating the seeds!

, Place the flat side of each large slice face down on the cutting board. Then, use the knife to slice or dice the apple into pieces. You can make thin slices for snacking or baking. Try dicing the apple to mix into salads and other dishes!

 The Cairo camel rental process begins with a ride to the Pyramids. The pyramid site is approximately 14 miles (23 km) from Cairo International Airport (CAI). Inexpensive, air-conditioned buses are available about every 20 minutes. You may also take a taxi from nearly anywhere in the city. You're less likely to have to haggle for a better price in the yellow taxis or on a bus than in the black-and-white taxis.;
, A trip on a pre-arranged tour is more expensive than a walk-up trip. Your package tour may also include a camel-riding experience.

If you're planning to go on a professional tour of Egypt and the Middle East, check with the tour operator to determine if the tour includes a tour of the pyramids riding camels. If it does, someone else will handle the legwork for you. This is certainly the easiest, though also the most expensive option for renting a camel in Cairo.
Several companies offer advance reservations for day trips that include camel-riding pyramid tours. These packages often include transportation from Cairo, several hours of camel riding, refreshments, and a tour guide. They tend to cost around US$100, but are usually reputable.
You can hire a camel after you have arrived at the pyramids. Be wary. Camel rental agencies have reputations of trying to take advantage of unsuspecting tourists. Some stories involve forcing people who rent a camel to pay a second fee to get off of the camel or repeatedly placing costume pieces (such as a Lawrence of Arabia-style turban) onto a renter just before taking a picture, and then asking for a "costume-rental fee."







, Like many services in Cairo, camel rental gets cheaper the better you are at bargaining. You should expect to pay around 40 Egyptian Pounds (US$7) for an on-site camel rental, though good prices range from 30 to 50 Egyptian Pounds ($5-8).

 You should wash the clothing in a washing machine if the stain doesn’t completely lift after you try scraping and blotting it. This is important to do if you don't want the clothing to be permanently damaged.


If the piece can easily be placed in the washing machine and washed, that will provide the easiest and most thorough removal method.It’s usually a good idea to pretreat the stain with laundry pre-wash stain remover., Run the warm water from the back of the stain through the front. This should help pull the toothpaste out of the woof of the woven fabric.


Gently rub the stain(s) with your finger under the water. Make sure the stains are out before you dry your clothing. Drying sets the stain into fabric more, making it tougher to remove.
If the stain is still there, soak the clothing in a bucket of very hot water and some detergent for a few hours. Do not dry in the dryer; rather, air dry until you are certain that no remnants remain. If you detect remnants of toothpaste, repeat the process.
 Remove the initial toothpaste and, once you are left with the residue that is worked into the fabric of your clothes, use dish soap and really scrub at the stain.


First, scrape off as much of the toothpaste as you can. Let the soap sit for about 10 minutes, and then clean the garment as usual.
You only need about a teaspoon of clear dish washing liquid and a cup of water. Mix them together and then use a clean rag to rub the mixture onto the stain.

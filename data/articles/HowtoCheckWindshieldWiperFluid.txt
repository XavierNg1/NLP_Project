 Ideally, you should do so on a level surface to help the engine bay cool. Wait for a few minutes, until the car hood is cool enough to rest your hand on.;
,, On most cars, the washer fluid reservoir is located at the back of the engine bay, near the base of the windshield. The tank is usually translucent, allowing you to see whether there is fluid in the reservoir or not.
 Many washer fluid reservoirs have marks to show the fluid level. If the tank is less than half-full, you'll need to refill it.


Also, check the tank for cracks or leaks.
 The reservoir cap usually is designed to screw on and off.
 You may want to use a funnel to avoid spills. Once you've refilled the tank, replace the cap and close the hood.
 This will let you test the washers' performance by turning on your windshield wipers and then the washers. The washers should deliver a steady stream of fluid; if not, you may have to clean the washer nozzles and lines.

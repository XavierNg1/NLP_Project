 Frequency and the time taken to finish a single wave oscillation are inversely proportional. As such, the formula for calculating frequency when given the time taken to complete a wave cycle is written as: f = 1 / TIn this formula, f represents frequency and T represents the time period or amount of time required to complete a single wave oscillation.
Example A: The time for a certain wave to complete a single oscillation is 0.32 seconds. What is the frequency of this wave?
Example B: In 0.57 seconds, a certain wave can complete 15 oscillations. What is the frequency of this wave?

, Usually, you will be told how long it takes to complete a single oscillation, in which case, you would just divide the number 1 by the time period, T. If given a time period for numerous oscillations, however, you will need to divide the number of oscillations by the overall time period required to complete them.


Example A: f = 1 / T = 1 / 0.32 = 3.125
Example B: f = 1 / T = 15 / 0.57 = 26.316

, This calculation should tell you the frequency of the wave. Write your answer in Hertz, Hz, the unit for frequency.


Example A: The frequency of this wave is 3.125 Hz.
Example B: The frequency of this wave is 26.316 Hz.

  Name the folder something recognizable, such as "Course Readings for Introduction to Literary Studies.";
,,,  This will move all of the documents into that folder.
  You should see the uploaded documents.
  For instance, you may want to rename a document titled "Twain1" to "Excerpt from Tom Sawyer" or "Mark Twain."  This will make it easier for the students to find the document.
  To do this, return to your Google Drive, and select the folder you just created.  Next, click the button marked "Share."

,  You will notice that a highlighted link appears in the box next.  This is the link you will give students to allow them to view the documents in the folder.


Note:  You may want to copy this link now and paste it into an email for your students.  However, you can always copy it later.
  They will be able to view and/or download the documents in the folder.  To share the link:


Put it in an email to students
Write it down and give it to them in class

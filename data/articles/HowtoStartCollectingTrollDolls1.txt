 Like many other collectibles the Troll Doll has many different confusing niches. Original Troll Dolls were made in 1959 by a Danish woodcutter and fisherman named Thomas Dam as a Christmas gift for his daughter. They were Good Luck Trolls and the first ones were made of wooden bodies, glass doll eyes and sheep-hair wool for hair these are very high quality and hard to find. He also had a toy store named Dam Things. In the United States these were sold around Halloween 1963 to 1965. This was a huge toy fad during the time period. Norfin (R) Trolls was the name after The E.F.S. Marketing Associates brought the name. Troll dolls were always produced in Europe although the fad disappeared in United States until the 1980's then Hasbro got into the mix creating action figures like Teenage Mutant Ninja Trolls etc. These new dolls are made of plastic.
 If you aren't concerned about value go ahead buy the ones you want.  Dam and Norfin and Dam things are the trolls that are the most value though trolls that are animals or have two heads are very rare. Any type of Dam Things Lucky Troll is pretty rare as well. There's always a limited edition that is worth lots of money so do your research.

Inspect your dolls for damage and wear and tear. If the doll is more valuable with an uniform make sure that uniform is in tact and not too damaged. Make sure the eyes and other parts of the body on in good shape and the classic rainbow hair is not damaged. Avoid dolls covered with dirt, crayon, markers, sand or scuff marks. Make sure the wood in the originals is not rotten and the glass eyes are on the doll.

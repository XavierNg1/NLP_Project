 Have both your eyes and ears on the teacher. Focus and take in on what he/she is talking about. Take notes if possible. Make sure the teacher knows you are focused on her/him.;
, To bring your grade up, you should study. Go to a library or somewhere else that's quiet. Make sure that there are no distractions that will keep you away from reaching your goal.
 That will make your teacher say, " Wow! So and So is making so much more of an effort!" It will bring up your grade and will make your teacher happy.
 You can be the smartest person in your class, but you have the worst obedience. Believe it or not, bad behavior can bring your grade down.

 A DNA digestion is a process that breaks the two strands of DNA apart. This leaves each strand without its complementary base pair. This opening allows the DNA to bind with other complementary strands., Electrophoresis is a process that uses electric current to carry molecules through a gel. In this case, you should use an agarose gel. The DNA will travel to toward the positive end of the gel and be separated by size., Once the strands have been separated, they must be transferred out of the gel. Use a Southern transfer procedure to transfer the sample to a sheet of nylon or nitrocellulose paper. These mediums are more appropriate for adding the probe., Probes are strands of DNA that compliment the strands in question. If the strand representing a specific genotype is present, it will bind the probe. The probe also contains a fluorescent molecule that will be detectable during analysis., After allowing ample time for the probe to bind to any sample present, you need to wash the paper. Follow the specific procedures for your lab, but this usually only involves lightly rinsing the paper with water. Be careful not to contaminate or damage the sample during the wash., Once the sample has been washed, you can examine it. Exposing the to sample to ultraviolet light will excite the fluorophore attached to the probe. This will produce an image with areas of intense light relative to the background. If there is no probe present, there will be no lighted areas.The presence of the probe indicates that the sequence corresponding to the genotype in question is present.

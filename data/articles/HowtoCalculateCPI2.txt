 Try to find something that you have an exact number for, and that you have recently purchased as well., It is best to compare the prices of the same brand of item that was purchased as the same store. Again, the purpose of CPI is not to determine how much you are saving by shopping at a different store or switching to generic brands.


Also avoid comparing sale items. The official CPI calculated by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics uses a large number of items found in a variety of locations in order to eliminate short-term fluctuations. Calculating the change for individual items is still worthwhile, but sales are another variable that should be eliminated.
 So, if a box of cereal once cost $2.50 but now costs $2.75, the result should be 1.1 (represented mathematically, 2.75รท2.5=1.1).
 Again, because the baseline for the CPI is 100--that is, the initial reference point, when compared to itself, equals 100%-- make your figure comparable.


Using the example, the CPI would be 110.
 In the case of the example, 110 minus 100 equals 10. That means that the price of the particular item examined has increased by 10% over time.

 Whether the science you read is an article, book, or web page, read the text in its entirety. As you read, pay attention to details. Write down or make a mental note of things that are confusing or unclear. Use a highlighter or pen to underline, circle, or highlight facts that can be verified.Verifiable facts are those which are based in objective reality rather than on opinion, conjecture, or unfounded belief.;
, All verifiable science relies on the work of other scientists to establish its credibility and inspire further studies. One way to verify the science you read is to follow up on the information provided in the study’s footnotes. Check referenced sources to ensure that their conclusions and statistics match those presented in the science literature you’re attempting to verify.If you’re reading science in a popular publication, sources will be cited in the text rather than in footnotes or endnotes.
Non-specialized sources should describe specific studies but might not refer to published peer-reviewed article by name. They might also refer to certain scientists or authors, or to the titles of scientific journals where relevant publications appeared. Use this information to track down more information whenever possible.
 If you’re confused about the science you read, contact a relevant scientist to help you verify it. For instance, if you wish to verify an astronomical report you read, you could contact an astronomer. If you wish to verify a physics issue, contact a physics professor.When you’ve discovered someone to help you verify the science you read, contact them and pose your question. Always be polite and professional when communicating with professional scientists.
Preferably, you will contact more than one expert in the field of the science you read. This will give you a range of opinions regarding whether the science you read is accurate.

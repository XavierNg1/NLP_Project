 Sit down when you have a quiet moment and evaluate the current state of your spiritual life. Be humble and honest with yourself. Ask yourself whether you incorporate your faith into your everyday routine, whether you use your faith to guide your decisions, and whether you feel close to God.Don’t be discouraged if you discover that your spiritual life needs some work. The point of this exercise is simply to figure out where your strengths and weaknesses are right now.;
, Ask yourself which aspects of your life are pulling you farther away from God. External pressures and responsibilities, such as work, school, and relationships, are common distractions. Don’t forget to consider internal distractions as well, like pride or materialism.For instance, if your pride drives you to try to solve all your problems without any help, you might have a hard time turning to God for guidance.
 Whatever your spiritual or religious affiliation, it can help to get advice from a leader. This person can help you identify barriers that are blocking you from deepening your relationship with God. Alternatively, they may also be able to help you see that you are actually doing quite well in your current spiritual practice.


Go to a trusted member of your spiritual community and explain your dilemma. Ask them how you can improve your focus on God and your spirituality.
 Think about how you would like to maintain or improve your relationship with God. Set some spiritual goals for yourself. Think about what you want your relationship with God to look like in a month or a year. Then think about how you can change your habits to make it happen.For instance, if you want to feel closer to God on a day-to-day basis, you could establish the habit of praying for a few minutes every morning.

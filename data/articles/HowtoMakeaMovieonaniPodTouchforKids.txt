 My friend and I had an idea about 2 best friends who touched a glitter rock and turned into mermaids.;
, If you don't know how to make a script, make a timeline. EX: Ashley walked up to Lucy.
"Ashley cried.
 My friends and I had to make our own mermaid tails.
 You need this to make your movie.


If you are filming with other people, arrange a date where they can come over to film the movie. My friend and I had to talk over the phone to arrange a date.
 If you are filming in one area, get a tripod and stand your ipod touch on it. If you don't have one, find something that will prop up your ipod touch. If you can't get any of this, you may want to ask a friend or family member to be the camera person. My friend and I had my mother be the camera woman.When she didn't want to do it, we propped her ipod touch on top of an old Barbie chair I had.
 After you are done filming, edit your movie. If you don't like your movie, film that part again!

, If you are old enough to go on YouTube, and your parents let you.... Make a youtube account!

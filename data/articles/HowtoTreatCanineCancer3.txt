 Chemotherapy involves using chemicals or drugs to induce remission or cure cancer. It works by killing fast growing cancer cells.It may be used as a solo therapy, especially in conditions, such as lymphoma, that are sensitive to certain drugs.
It can also be used as one part of multiple therapeutic treatments, to reduce the size of a cancer of kill metastatic cells that have spread distant to the original cancer site.
 The aim of chemotherapy is pets is different to that in people. It is generally ethically agreed that quality of life, rather than length of life, is most important for pets.This means the aim of chemo is not to cure the patient but to reduce their symptoms and buy them more good quality time.


The doses of drugs used are usually much reduced to the human equivalent, and therefore the side effects are less severe. While some drugs do cause a temporary feeling of sickness, this is usually easy to control with a preemptive anti-nausea injection. Also, the lower doses mean the dog does not lose its hair, as people do., Chemotherapy takes different forms. Some regimes involves pills you give regularly at home. This is usually daily, on alternate days, or weekly, depending on the drug and the size of your dog). Other forms involve intravenous injections that are given under tightly controlled conditions at the vet clinic.No chemotherapy drug should be handled with bare hands, so if you have drugs dispensed to administer at home be sure to wear latex gloves.
Also, if you are pregnant or have a health problem yourself, make sure the prescribing vet is aware of this so they can decide if it's safe for you to handle that specific drug.
 Some monitoring of the patient is necessary, usually blood tests to measure the amount of white blood cells in the dog's circulation. If the chemo drugs suppress the immune system too much, then therapy may need to be halted and antibiotics started, to give the body a chance to produce more white cells.

 Use a sharp knife to cut up 6 half-ounce (14 g) pieces of your favorite chocolates into small pieces. Set the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Keep the burner set to low, stirring throughout until the chocolate is melted.You can use dark chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semisweet chocolate, or milk chocolate in any combination that you like.
If you don’t have chocolate pieces to melt, you can use an equal amount of chocolate chips.
You can also melt the chocolate in the microwave. Place it in a microwave-safe bowl, and heat on high for 1 ½ to 2 minutes or until the chocolate is soft enough that you can stir it until it is melted through., To the melted chocolate, add 2 tablespoons (15 g) of store bought hot cocoa mix and 1 ½ tablespoons (18 g) of sugar. Stir until the mixture is smooth and fully blended.If you prefer to make your own hot cocoa mix, sift together 2 cups (250 g) of powdered sugar, 1 cup (118 g) unsweetened cocoa powder, and 2 cups (136 g) powdered milk, mixing until thoroughly combined. Store in an airtight container., Take the chocolate, cocoa, and sugar mixture off the heat, and mix in ½ cup (142 ml) of milk. Stir the ingredients until the mixture is entirely smooth.You can use any type of milk that you like, but whole milk will provide the creamiest frozen hot cocoa. You can even substitute half-and-half for the milk if you want a really decadent, rich treat.
 Let the chocolate, cocoa, sugar, and milk mixture cool to room temperature. Pour it into a blender with the remaining 1 cup (284 ml) of milk and 3 cups (650 g) of ice. Blend the mixture on high speed until it is completely smooth.When you’re finished blending the frozen hot cocoa, it should be the same consistency as a frozen daiquiri.
 Transfer the frozen hot cocoa to a large glass or goblet. Top it with whipped cream and some chocolate shavings, and serve.


The frozen hot chocolate is so thick that you should serve it with a straw and a spoon.

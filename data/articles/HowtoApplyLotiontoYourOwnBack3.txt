 The exact length that you cut is up to you, but a longer piece will make the process easier. Use either a cutter that’s attached to the plastic wrap box or use a sharp pair of scissors.Plastic cling wrap can be difficult to keep from tangling up and sticking to itself, so place it flat on the table before you cut it. This will help keep it from wrinkling up.
If you don’t have plastic wrap on hand, you could substitute a number of different plastic sheet options. If you have an old disposable tablecloth, you could cut from that. You could cut a strip from a trash bag. You could even use the wrapping from a big pack of toilet paper.
 Squeeze as much lotion as you think you need onto the plastic strip. Lotion often goes farther than you think it will, so don’t overdo it. A blob that is an inch or two wide should be sufficient.


You can also put the lotion on the plastic wrap in a thin strip that is five or six inches long.
 If you try to pick up the plastic wrap while it is in front of you, you may up end with a mess. Turn so your back is toward the plastic wrap and you are close enough to touch it.


If you laid the plastic wrap out on a counter that is too high for you to reach behind you, pick the plastic wrap up in front of you and move it to a lower surface.
 Grab each end of the plastic wrap with one hand and lift it from the surface. Place the lotion against your back starting in the lower section first.


You may need to turn your head and look over your shoulder so you can see where the plastic wrap is at in order to pick it up.
 Pretend that you are using a towel to dry off your back and pull the plastic wrap side to side distributing the lotion onto your back. You can use an upward zigzag motion to reach up toward the middle of your back.You can reach more areas of your back by letting go of the plastic wrap with one hand and reaching over the top of your shoulder to swipe the plastic wrap in a more up and down motion getting your shoulder blade area.

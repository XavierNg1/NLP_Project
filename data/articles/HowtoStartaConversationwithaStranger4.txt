 Look for signs, some more obvious than others, that your conversation is going somewhere. If there's no connection, you will recognize that instinctively. You will receive monosyllabic answers like "Oh, hi," when you introduce yourself, or a glib response like, "Not much." when you ask them what's going on.


If the person you want to talk to doesn't seem like they're interested in talking back, then don't force it. It could be that they're just having a terrible day, or it could mean they just don't want to chat with you.
If they're clearly distracted, looking for somebody or something, you have either picked the wrong time to make an introduction, or they are trying to suggest you leave them alone, without them having to force them to actually tell you they're not interested.
If you sense any of that, excuse yourself, wish them well. and be on your way.
If you still hope to strike up a conversation with this person, the better you're able to key in on their moods and looks, the more likely it is you'll be successful next time you make your approach.
 If nothing is working, try again at a later date. If you get a similar or more hostile response the second time, do not make a third attempt. After two attempts, the person has a pretty clear idea that you're interested in talking to them. Let them make the next move.

 The waistband of the jeans typically contain a different amount of material than the hems, making a stack of jeans tilted and uneven. Prevent this by alternating the position of the waistband between the left and right sides of the stack.
 Use a box or basket to stack your folded jeans in a horizontal row. This makes it easy to pull out the pair you want without moving the rest of the stack. Keep the folded edge at the top to keep the stack tidy.
 If you own many pairs of jeans, sort them into separate stacks for ease of selection. Consider arranging them by style of cut (e.g. bell bottoms, tight jeans, and loose jeans) to make the neatest stacks. Other possible sorting criteria include color, pattern, or frequency of use.









Consider using shelf dividers to keep different categories of jeans separate in the same container.

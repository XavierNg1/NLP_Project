 The height of a triangle can be found if you have an angles and a side, if the angle is between the base and the side you have, or all three sides. We'll call the sides of the triangle a, b, and c, and the angles, A, B, and C.


If you have all three sides, you'll use Heron's formula, and the formula for the area of a triangle.
If you have two sides and an angle, you'll use the formula for the area given two angles and a side. A = 1/2ab(sin C)., Heron's formula has two parts. First, you must find the variable s, which is equal to half of the perimeter of the triangle. This is done with this formula: s = (a+b+c)/2.So for a triangle with sides a = 4, b = 3, and c = 5, s = (4+3+5)/2. Which is s = (12)/2. Which is s = 6.
Then you can use the second part of Heron's formula, Area = sqr(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c). Replace Area in the equation with it's equivalent in the area formula: 1/2bh (or 1/2ah or 1/2ch).
Do the math to solve for h. For our example triangle this looks like 1/2(3)h = sqr(6(6-4)(6-3)(6-5). Which is 3/2h = sqr(6(2)(3)(1). Which is 3/2h = sqr(36). Use a calculator to calculate the square root, which in this case makes it 3/2h = 6. Therefore, height is equal to 4, using side b as the base.
 Replace area in the formula with it's equivalent in the area of a triangle formula: 1/2bh. This gives you a formula that looks like 1/2bh = 1/2ab(sin C). This can be simplified to h = a(sin C), thereby eliminating one of the side variables.Solve the equation with your given variables. For example, with a = 3, and C = 40 degrees, the equation looks like this: h = 3(sin 40). Use your calculator to finish the equation, which in our example, makes h roughly 1.928.

 There is a wide variety of possible colorings for use with fondant, including:


Paste colors - only use a tiny quantity as this is very concentrated
Gel colors - this is a strong color and it's easy to use
Powder colors - this needs to be dissolved in liquid before use to avoid undissolved pieces showing in the fondant
Liquid colors - use cake decorating versions to ensure nice consistency
Lustres - for adding a sheen.
 (Many people are allergic to this). Daffodil Yellow currently contains alcohol which all other colors do not have present.






Leaf Green is a brighter green with more yellow than Kelly Green. Both of these greens require very little color, how much color added depends on the tone of the green you want.






When icing is colored deep red, a bitter aftertaste may be detected. Red No-Taste should be used when a large portion of red coloring is used on the cake. Red No-Taste does not contain red 3 which causes the bitter taste.






Rose paste color will obtain hot pink with good results. Rose Petal is a soft, muted rose color. Pink is a traditional pastel with a slight yellow tone.

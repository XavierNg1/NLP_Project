This line is fairly simple. Before your can run any queries on a specific database, you must select which database. In PHP to do this we use the "mysql_select_db" function, which requires 1 argument. The first argument in the code is required, it is the name of the database to connect to. The second argument I used is not required but good practice; it defines which server connection to use to select the database.

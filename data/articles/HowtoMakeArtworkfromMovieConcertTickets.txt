 Consider how you’d like to approach the project, whether you want to include all your entertainment memories together in one frame or if you’d like to create a series of smaller frames, broken out by artist, medium or era.


Examine each ticket to ensure it’s salvageable. If the ticket stub is totally trashed or cannot be restored you may want to retire it to the “circular file” or it may be better off in your jewelry drawer or even in a safety deposit box if it’s valuable.
Group tickets per frame. Since each ticket is most likely a different size and shape you’ll want to see what you have to fit the tickets together to form an aesthetically pleasing design.;
, Find the picture frame to hold and display the tickets. Look for something that has a pre-cut mat so you have a backing to hold the tickets.


Consider your overall décor when selecting a frame. Choose a frame that either complements your current style or one that is similar to what you have on display.
Choose a frame size that will easily accommodate your collection. Whether you are planning a series of frames or want to make one large statement have a plan in terms of the number and size of frames you plan to use.
 Remove the mat from the glass and frame to reveal a workspace area. Arrange tickets on the mat without using the Spray Mount adhesive to look at different designs.
 Press firmly in place so the tickets hold in place and do not fall.


Allow amply time for the tickets to dry before replacing frame. Allow at least an hour of dry time before replacing frame and hanging picture on the wall.

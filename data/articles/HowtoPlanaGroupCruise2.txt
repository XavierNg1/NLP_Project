 While all of you might be going in different directions throughout the day, agreeing to share the evening meal together will give you an opportunity to be together and share the best parts of your day.
 Depending on the number of people in your group, it might be difficult to do everything together. Instead, plan a few outings together. Meet for coffee one morning, enjoy a show in the evening or meet up for the midnight buffet.
 Not everyone needs to do the same excursions, but you can break into smaller groups to explore your destinations.


Stay on the boat, if that is more your speed. You can take advantage of swimming pools, eat some more, hit the gym or enjoy a spa service on most ships.
 You do not need to be part of the group all the time. Everyone will find themselves needing a little quiet time in the cabin or some solitary reading time on a lounge chair.
 Try not to pressure your group members into a $250 excursion if you are the only one who can afford it.

 Scrub the skin with a vegetable brush under running water.
 Use the tines of a fork to pierce the outside of each sweet potato several times, covering the exterior in tiny holes.
 The sweet potatoes can be piled up near the top, but you should still be able to cover the slow cooker with a lid without any difficulty.
 A little water will help the sweet potatoes cook better, but there should not be enough water to cover them. You do not want them to boil in the slow cooker. Instead, the water is there to prevent the sweet potatoes from drying out and potentially burning.
 Cover the slow cooker and set the heat to low, cooking the sweet potatoes until they become tender.
 Cut the sweet potatoes open with a knife or fork. They should be tender enough to fall apart without needing to loosen the flesh using other techniques. Add 6 tbsp. of butter and salt and pepper to taste before serving.

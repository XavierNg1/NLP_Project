Finches communicate important information to one another through song, so youâ€™ll get to enjoy their wonderful tweets!Finches sing to their babies before they are born in order to communicate environmental conditions.
 As long as they are well fed and have enough room to fly around and socialize with one another, finches are easy to care for! In comparison to other birds, like the Parakeet, owning a finch is not a huge time commitment., Finches love to hang out with one another, so you should avoid purchasing just one finch!

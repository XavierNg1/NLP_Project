 Place the baking rack in the bottom third of the oven.
 Start by chopping off the top part with the stem and discarding it. Then, cut the squash in half vertically from top to bottom using a sawing motion with your knife. Pry the two halves apart when you are done.
 Be sure to scrape all of the stringy bits out. Discard the pulp, but consider saving the seeds for roasting in another recipe.
 Place the squash cut-side-down on the cutting board. Cut it into slices, like bread, going from one end to the other.
 You can do this using your fingers or a basting brush.
 It might be easier to combine the spices in a jar first, and then sprinkle them over both sides of the squash. Alternatively, you could also toss the squash slices with the spices, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.If you don't have cumin, coriander, or cayenne pepper, try: 1 minced garlic clove and 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh sage, thyme, or rosemary., Keep the rack in the bottom third of the oven. The squash is ready when it starts to turn brown and soft., You can serve it with the skin, or you can cut the skin away before serving it. Enjoy the squash while it is still hot.

 For this project you’ll need a globe, black and aqua acrylic paint, gold spray paint and a gold pen. Use a thin paintbrush to outline all the continents in black. Then use a larger paintbrush to fill in the oceans with black paint. Paint the continents using aqua paint. Allow the globe to dry, then remove it from its stand and balance it on a bowl so you can paint Antarctica and the North Pole. While your globe is drying, spruce up the stand using the spray paint. When the globe is dry, reattach it to its stand and use your sharpie to freehand your song lyrics across the globe.Depending on your globe, you may need more than one coat of paint.
You can substitute these colors for other colors if you prefer.
 For this project, you will need a freshly washed and ironed white pillowcase and a black Sharpie fabric pen. Choose a song lyric that is particularly meaningful to you and using your Sharpie pen, write it across both sides of the pillowcase.Place a sheet of cardboard between the pillowcase to keep the words from bleeding onto the other side.
Depending on your preferences, you can use a ruler to center the words, or freehand it.
Give your pillowcase 24 hours to dry before washing.
 For this project, all you’ll need is a white coffee mug and food safe permanent markers. Wipe down your coffee mug, then use your favorite lyrics to create a design on your cup. Bake your mug at 375 degrees for 40 minutes.Be careful not to smudge your design; the marker will still be wet until after your bake your mug.
To keep your mug from cracking, allow it to heat up and cool down in the oven.

 Use the present subjunctive when you need to describe an act of reading that is supposedly presently going on when one doubts or denies that it is actually going on.


Example: "I doubt that they read many books," Dudo que ellos lean muchos libros.

yo: lea
tú: leas
él/ella/usted: lea
nosotros/-as: leamos
vosotros/-as: leáis
ellos/ellas/ustedes: lean

, The imperfect subjunctive is used to describe an act of seeing that one doubts or denies has happened in the past.


Note that there are two forms of the imperfect subjunctive for all six tenses of the conjugation.
The verb leer is irregular in the imperfect subjunctive.
Example: "I doubt that you read that book," Dudo que leyeras ese libro.

yo: leyera or leyese
tú: leyeras or leyeses
él/ella/usted: leyera or leyese
nosotros/-as: leyéramos or leyésemos
vosotros/-as: leyerais or leyeseis
ellos/ellas/ustedes: leyeran or leyesen

, The verb leer is irregular in the future subjunctive. The future subjunctive should be used when you need to describe an act of reading that may happen in the future when one doubts that the act will actually happen.


Example: "I doubt that we will read that book," Dudo que leyéremos ese libro.

yo: leyere
tú: leyeres
él/ella/usted: leyere
nosotros/-as: leyéremos
vosotros/-as: leyereis
ellos/ellas/ustedes: leyeren

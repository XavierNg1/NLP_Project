 Salt water can be corrosive to your board if it isn’t rinsed after you surf. Use a public water source to rinse off your board right as you come off the beach to remove the salt water from it., Before you clean your longboard, you'll want to remove the wax that is most likely on it. If your wax is cold or at room temperature, it’s going to be relatively hard to scrape off. A way to get around this is to allow the heat from the sun to soften the wax first. Once the wax is soft, move your board to a cleaning area outside.
 Work from the top of your board down to the bottom and scrape off all of the wax that’s on the surface of the board. A wax comb is an industrial surfer tool that you can use to remove the wax quickly. If you don’t have that, you can use a credit card. Move from one side of the board to the other and remove the layer of wax from your board.If you are having problems lifting the wax from your board, you can drip some liquid coconut oil onto the surface of your board to try to loosen it.
 Soap will keep your board clean and can prevent mildew and bacteria from growing on it. Saturate a sponge with soap and water and use to clean your board. Once you’ve covered the entirety of the board, rinse it off with a hose.You can also use inflatable boat cleaner.
 WD-40 will help loosen existing dirt and any left over wax that might still be on your board. Spray some of the solution onto dirtier areas of your board and then go over them with a rag. Make sure to rinse and wipe down the area after you use the WD-40.Use citrus cleaner as an all-natural alternative to WD-40.
 Use a dry cotton rag to wipe up the rest of the moisture from your longboard. When it’s dry, put your longboard in a sock, or a cloth covering and keep it out of direct sunlight.Remember to re-wax your longboard before you take it out to the ocean again.

 With a grapevine wicker wreath, you can simply stick the stems of your tulips into the base. They should stay in place when inserted into the wicker. Make one layer of tulips surrounding the front of your wicker base., When you're done with the first layer, add another. This will allow you to fill in any obvious gaps and add more color variation if you want.The second layer comes down to personal preference. If you prefer a thicker wreath, add more tulips to gaps. If you want to add color variation, add different colored tulips to various portions of the wreath.
 Some buds may detach from the stems while you're making your wreath. Use hot glue to glue these buds back in place. Make sure to add the glue to the back of the tulip flower. You do not want it to show up on your wreath., Cut out a piece of ribbon as big as you want your hanger. Tie each end to the back of the wreath. You can then hang your wreath somewhere in your home or on your front door.

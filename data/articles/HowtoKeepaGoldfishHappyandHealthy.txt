 The best aquarium is 10 gallons (37.9Â L) or so for a happy and healthy goldfish, do not put it in a goldfish bowl.;
,, Your goldfish will appreciate it. A good rule is: three fourths open water, one fourth decorated.
 This is like a whole new playground for your goldfish.
 Shrimp, clam, brine shrimp, Daphnia, night crawlers; boiled lettuce, spinach, and other greens are all great choices.
 Goldfish can be trained to ring a bell for food. This provides stimulation to the goldfish and a deeper level to heir keeping than observation.

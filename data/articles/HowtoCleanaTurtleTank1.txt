 Pick it up gently from the tank, and set it in a bucket, bowl, or the carrying case you brought it home in from the pet store.In this other container, put both enough water for swimming, and enough material--such as peat or rocks--to allow the turtle something to climb on. And for sanitary reasons, don’t use this secondary container for anything else but a temporary home for your turtle.Use a transplant container large enough to allow the turtle to be able to turn around while swimming. A transparent container is preferable.;
, Unplug and then remove the tank’s electric devices, and place them in a sink or bucket for cleaning. Remember where the devices were located for when you need to put them back. Keeping the same setup as before will avoid disorienting your turtle.
 One by one, remove any plastic or live plants, large rocks, or pieces of wood. Place them in a separate bucket that you will use only for this purpose, for sanitary reasons. Or if you decide to clean the tank in a bathtub, you can place them aside in the tub.
 Depending on how far you can carry the tank, either outside in a grassy area, or in a bathtub are good cleaning areas. Never try to carry a tank by yourself: be sure to ask someone, preferably an adult, to help you carry the tank. Position yourselves on opposite ends of the short sides of the tank, slide it slowly to the edge of its table, and pick it up from below with both hands.
 Lift one end of the tank until the water pours out completely. Ask someone to help you lift it if the tank is too heavy for you. Lift the tank from a squatting position, extending your legs, instead of standing over it and trying to lift it with just your arms and back.


If you have a substrate of small, gravelly rocks, you can leave those in the tank. If your substrate is some kind of organic matter such as peat or nut shells, discard and replace these during each cleaning.

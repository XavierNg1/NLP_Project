 Kechari Mudra is an advanced yoga practice in which the practitioner uses their tongue to strengthen their body and raise their level of consciousness.The idea with Kechari Mudra Yoga is to slowly increase the length of the tongue until it’s eventually long enough to enter and stimulate certain areas in the nasal cavity.


With continued practice, Kechari Mudra may also help the practitioner fight diseases and lower their breathing rate.;
, While sitting in a comfortable position, roll your tongue up to touch your upper palate. See how far back your tongue is able to go. You may only be able to touch your hard palate when first starting out.


Hold your tongue back until you start to feel pain, then rest your tongue in its normal position.
As you continue practicing Kechari Mudra Yoga, your tongue should stretch and reach further back towards your uvula.
After you gain some confidence, you can practice Kechari Mudra while engaging in light activities.
 In the final stages of Kechari Mudra, your tongue should be long enough to go behind your uvula and up into your nasal cavity. You’ll reach this stage more safely and successfully with the help of an expert yogi to assist you in your practice.


Your guide may recommend the application of butter or ghee to draw out and lengthen your tongue. At this point, your tongue should be long enough to reach the center of your eyebrows.
Even with a guide, Kechari Mudra may take months or years to master.

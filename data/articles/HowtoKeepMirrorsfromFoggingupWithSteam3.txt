Dip a rag into the mixture and use your rag to wipe down and clean off your mirror. The glycerine will keep the mirror from fogging up next time you use the shower.Glycerine is non-toxic, so itâ€™s fine to get it on your hands.
 The pad is electrical and adheres to the back of your mirror and is guaranteed to clear fog from even the steamiest of bathrooms.This method is both expensive and time consuming and is therefore not recommended if you are renting your home.


Because the pad utilizes electricity and because you will have to remove your mirror to install it, you should hire a professional to take care of it.
Depending on the size of your mirror, the pad will cost at minimum, upwards of 100 dollars.

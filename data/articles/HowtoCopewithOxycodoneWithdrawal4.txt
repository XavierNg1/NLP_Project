 Coping with withdrawal symptoms can be difficult. If you have family or friends who can help you, it can make the process easier. You may feel guilty or ashamed because of your Oxycodone dependence, but don’t let that keep you from getting support from the people in your life.Tell your family or friends, “I have decided to stop taking Oxycodone. Since I have been taking it for awhile, I am going to go through withdrawal. It will be difficult, so I was hoping you could help me through this time.”

, Going through withdrawal can be very difficult. However, the withdrawal will end and you can get through it. Unfortunately, you will experience some symptoms, but they will end, even if it takes you a few weeks. Just remember that you will not be on Oxycodone when you get through it, so try to stay strong.

 When your dog was younger, it relied on a combination of verbal and visual cues. However, with its poor eyesight, you will need to train your dog to rely more heavily on verbal cues. For example, if you trained your dog to sit or stand in response to visual cues, you will need to retrain it to respond better to the verbal commands “sit” and “stay.”To avoid retraining your dog when it is older, teach it to respond to visual and verbal cues when it is young.
 A clicker can be a helpful way to train a blind dog because it helps reinforce your commands. When your dog does what you commanded, click the clicker. Eventually, the dog will respond to the clicker and not your voice. This is particularly useful if your dog also suffers from hearing impairment and has a hard time responding to the pitch of your voice.If you know that your dog’s eyesight is deteriorating, begin clicker training it immediately. This will make the transition to using only verbal commands much easier.
You can also train a dog with poor eyesight to respond to a vibration collar.
 As your dog’s vision declines, noise-making toys will help it perform many of its former tricks. Use balls that rattle or jingle. You can also purchase scented toys that your dog has to search for by sniffing out the toy and bringing it back. Scented toys are great for slower passed game of fetch.

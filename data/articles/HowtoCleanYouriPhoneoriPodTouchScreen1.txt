 If you attempt to clean the screen of the device while it is still turned on, you risk permanently damaging it.Refer to the instruction manual that came with your device if you have trouble turning it off.;
, Your device may have come with a small, soft cloth that is made to be lint-free. This type of cloth won't scratch the surface of the iPhone or iPod touch. Gently wipe the screen from top to bottom with the cloth to remove fingerprints.Use a circular rubbing motion to remove substances that don't wipe away easily.
Don't press down to hard on the screen, or you may remove some of the oleophobic coating.
 If your device's screen has a bit of dried soda or some grime that you couldn't wipe away with the cloth alone, you can wet it a little with clean water. Moisten it with a few drops, squeeze it out, and use the dampened cloth to remove the stuck-on substance.Do not soak the cloth in water. Excess water will harm the screen on your device, so it's important to get it just a little wet before cleaning.
Don't let moisture sit on the screen. Wipe it away immediately with a dry part of the cloth.
Avoid wiping the ports. If moisture gets into these areas it could cause permanent damage to your device.

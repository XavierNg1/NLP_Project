 Zinc is often overused in denture adhesives, so much so that zinc-free paste adhesive is now available. Using a paste adhesive that contains zinc combined with a diet high in zinc can lead to excessive zinc in your body and possible health issues.If you use a paste adhesive that contains zinc, only use it as directed on the label and do not use too much adhesive.;
, Before you apply adhesive, you need to clean your dentures under running water and your normal denture cleanser. Then, pat them dry. Dry dentures will help the paste adhesive to stay attached to the dentures, and to your gums.This will ensure a very stable bite and will prevent food from getting underneath your dentures.
 Do not use more denture adhesive than directed on the label. Always begin with a small amount of adhesive so you donâ€™t put too much on your dentures.Apply three to four dabs of the paste the size of a pencil eraser to the upper denture, equally distributing the paste on the inside surface. Do not apply the paste too close to the edge of your denture.
 The dabs should be no bigger than a pencil eraser and should not be too close to the edge of your denture. Again, make sure the dabs are evenly spaced along the inside surface of the denture., If any of the adhesive oozes out on the sides of the dentures, you have used too much adhesive. You may need to remove the dentures, clean off the adhesive and reapply, using less on the upper and lower dentures., If you put the adhesive on your dentures properly, you should not need to reapply the adhesive throughout the day.A standard 40 g tube of adhesive should last at least four weeks, a 47 g tube should last five weeks, and a 70 g tube should last at least eight weeks. Avoid overusing the denture adhesive or using too much every day.

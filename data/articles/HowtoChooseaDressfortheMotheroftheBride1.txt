 How formal is the wedding? This will affect the kind of dress it's appropriate to wear. A very formal wedding will require a dress to match, while you can go for something more casual for a low-key wedding.A full-length is required for a very formal wedding. Your dress should minimize sparkle. Stick to a conservative gown in only one or two colors.
A very casual wedding, like a beach wedding, does not call for a very fancy dress. A sundress may be sufficient, although a light shawl or cardigan may be necessary in case it gets chilly. Make sure to consult with the bride so your dress is not more formal than her dress.
For semi-formal weddings, choose a dress that matches the attire of the bride and bridesmaids. Something like a halter dress with a jacket can easily fit in at a semi-formal affair.;
, If a wedding has a strict theme, it's important your dress matches that theme. Make sure you know the theme of the wedding, and the kind of attire that's appropriate, before selecting a dress.For example, a wedding with a renaissance theme may require a dress with an archaic feel.
Religious and other customs may also affect the type of dress you should wear. A wedding following a specific religious tradition, for example, may require a special type of dress.
 When the wedding takes place can also affect the appropriate type of dress. Day and morning weddings generally require shorter, slightly more casual dresses. Weddings that take place closer to the evening often require evening dresses., A destination wedding may come with special considerations in regards to style. A wedding at a castle, for example, may require a long ball gown. A wedding at a beach may require a light, sunny dress.

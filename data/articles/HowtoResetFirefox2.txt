 This will let you reset Firefox even if it won't open without crashing:Windows: Hold down ⇧ Shift while opening Firefox. If this doesn't work, search your computer for a "Mozilla Firefox (Safe Mode)" shortcut.
Mac: Hold down ⌥ Option while opening Firefox.
Linux: Run /path/to/firefox/firefox -safe-mode from Terminal.
 If a list of profiles appears, hold down the same key while clicking your profile. This will only happen if you have more than one profile.
 Before the Firefox browser window appears, a popup with two items should appear. Select Refresh Firefox to reset your settings and delete all add-ons. This is a permanent change.


Alternatively, select Start in Safe Mode to see if that solves the problem for this session. If it does, try disabling some add-ons and restarting Firefox normally. If it doesn't, start again in safe mode and reset Firefox.

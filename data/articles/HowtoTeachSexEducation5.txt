 Some children from 15 to 19 years old will be sexually active so it is important to talk about what consent is, what it looks like, and stress the importance of it. Teaching consent will decrease the likelihood of sexual violence and also promote healthier relationships and better overall sexual health. An overview of consent includes knowing that:


Consent is a voluntary and enthusiastic "yes". It is not based on silence, previous sexual activities, or what the person is wearing.Consent needs to be asked and given. Both parties should ask each other if they would be willing to engage in a certain sexual activity and both parties should answer.
Consent is not coercion. Pressuring someone into sex, threatening them, intimidating them, blackmailing then, or guilt-tripping them into sexual acts are all forms of coercion.
 Depending on your program or curriculum, you may need to teach children how to use protection or about contraception. You may need to provide them with demonstrations, resources, and discuss the benefits and effects of using protection and contraceptives.


Be sure to talk about the wide variety of contraceptives available. For example, condoms can be used by both females and males.
Teach children the effects of having unprotected sex. These include having an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy, and receiving and transmitting diseases.

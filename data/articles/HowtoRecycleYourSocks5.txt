 Push the dog’s ball down to the toe of the sock. Other objects that can be put inside the sock instead of a ball include treats or an empty plastic water bottle. The dog will enjoy any of these objects but the sock will cause them to last longer than store-bought toys., Wrap the sock around itself to form a knot. Do this above the ball so the dog has an easier time picking up the toy and won’t chew the ends off immediately.


If you want the dog to get the object out right away, such as with a treat, don’t tie the sock. Bunch the sock into a ball.
 Throw the toy. The dog will likely see that the toy is in the shape of a ball, smell the treat, or hear the water bottle. As long as they’ve seen the object inside the sock, they won’t use your good socks as chew toys.
 After use, the sock will eventually begin to wear down. Trim off any frayed threads while the sock is in use and pick up torn pieces. When the sock is too damaged, replace the toy.


Some dogs may consume pieces of the sock, which can lead to bowel blockage, so be careful and opt for smoother socks.

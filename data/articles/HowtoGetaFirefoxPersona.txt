,,,, If you're looking for certain designs (for example abstract), look to the left side and find the words "Categories", under that will be lots of designs.
 Scroll back to the top and look to the upper right. You should see a blank bar with a magnifying glass. In the bar, type a keyword that would represent your persona. For example, if you're looking for a turtle persona, type in turtles. If you are too specific, for example: "Pink circles with hearts and smile faces", it will not detect anything. Use simple keywords.

 Because this method involves caustic, flammable materials, you will need a container capable of holding high temperatures without shattering or melting.

If you use glass, make sure it is a thick, sturdy glass.
If you use metal, be aware that the metal may tarnish.
 Making sure you are in a well-ventilated area, place heat-resistant gloves on your hands, and a face mask over your nose and mouth. You should also place protective eyewear on your eyes so as not to singe your eyebrows or lashes., Pour equal amounts of acetone (nail polish remover) and metal polish into your non-flammable container, making sure the mixture does not exceed more than a quarter of an inch (.635 cm). If it does reach higher, youâ€™ll need to find a larger container.


Once you have placed the mixture into your bowl, coat your brass item with it to encourage the fire to burn away the lacquer.
 Stepping as far from the container as possible, set light to the solution using a long-necked lighter or long matchstick. This will make sure the mixture is not near enough to your skin to expose you to excess heat and risk burns.


Do not use a regular matchstick or cigarette lighter, as both require you to be dangerously close to the flammable solution.
 The solution should burn itself out after 3-5 minutes. If it does not, douse the flames using an extinguisher or by placing a large lid over the pot. Longer than 5 minutes runs the risk of damaging your brass.
 Removing your brass pieces from the bowl with tongs, run them under room temperature water to cool the metal and strip away the lacquer.


If you use cool water, the brass may cool faster, but you also run the risk of warping and staining. Room temperature water will cool the metal without damaging it.
 If any lacquer does not wash away in the rinse, wipe away the remainder with a clean cloth or cotton swabs. This is best done while running the item under water, as a dry piece of brass may not release its lacquer easily.

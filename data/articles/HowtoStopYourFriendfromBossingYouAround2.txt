 Sometimes, removing yourself from the situation just means tuning your friend out for minute. Other times, you may literally have to walk away and put distance between yourself and your friend. This will send a message to your friend that you will not tolerate the bossiness and, at the same time, remove you from the situation.If your friend is insisting that you talk to them during a lecture, you may have to get up and move a few seats down to end the conversation before you end up in trouble. If you cannot move immediately, you can choose to sit away from that friend next time you come to the class.
 You should never place your self-worth on the opinion of one person. Deriving your value from the opinion of one friend will give that friend the power to boss you around. As long as you keep a diverse group of friends you will get positive reinforcement with or without your bossier friends.
 This should be reserved for a last resort. Consequences can often cause a rift or conflict between friends that may or may not heal. If you have tried talking to your friend about the bossiness with no progress, explain to them that there will be consequences for continuing to boss you around.You should never threaten to hurt anyone as a consequence for bossing you around. Appropriate consequences might be something like ending the friendship or refusing to help the friend with things that they need your help on.

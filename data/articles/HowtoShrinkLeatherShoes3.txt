 If the shoe is too big in the toe, a small bundle of tissue paper may prevent the shoe from slipping. Cloth or newspaper may work as well, but you may wish to walk around at home for an hour to see if it is comfortable before leaving the hose.
 If there is a gap between the top of your foot and the shoe, you would probably benefit from a thicker insole. Insoles can be purchased at shoe stores and some drug stores, or removed from another shoe. They are typically made from rubber or foam. Cut them to fit your shoe if they are too large, using an ordinary pair of scissors.









Remove the existing insole in your shoe first if one is present. This is a thin piece of material which can be lifted out from the inside heel. If the bottom of the shoe seems attached, leave it inside the shoe.

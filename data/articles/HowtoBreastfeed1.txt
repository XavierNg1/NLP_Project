 Try feeding when sitting in a large comfortable chair, recliner or sofa; any of these will make it easier to settle down to nurse. Keep a large water bottle nearby, or even a good snack to fight the hunger that can come suddenly to a new mother. Ideally, the station could be near the baby's crib so you can feed the baby as quickly as possible.


It depends on your circumstances and perspective: some women are perfectly comfortable nursing in public, while others only do so in private.;
, A nursing bra or tank can help you feed more easily in public, if you're comfortable with that. But really, any soft, comfortable button-down shirts will do just fine and will be easy to bunch and to give your baby easy access to your breasts. The more skin to skin you share with the baby, the more stimulated he will be, so there's no need for you or your baby to wear a million layers.
 Get help from a maternity nurse either before or right after your baby is born, or even enroll in a prenatal breastfeeding class. This can help you be relaxed and ready on the day when your baby arrives -- and he'll be hungry when he does.
 Though a pacifier will certainly do the trick -- pacify your baby -- it may make it more difficult for you to breastfeed. To keep your baby focused on sucking on your breasts instead of the pacifier, you shouldn't give him or her one until your baby reaches 3-4 weeks old. That will be enough time for your baby to become accustomed to breastfeeding. There are also arguments for using the pacifier right away; do your research to learn what's best for you and your child.

 This includes the number one-hundred. For instance, you’d write, “seventy-eight” or “sixty-two.” The same rule applies for ordinal numbers.


Alternatively, write out numbers up to nine; after nine, use words. Chicago has this rule as an alternative—you can choose which rule you would like to follow.
 If you are starting your sentence with a number, write it out, regardless of whether or not it is more than one-hundred.


For example, you could write “One-hundred ninety-two people ate pie.”

, Use numbers for percent, but spell out “percent”. Spell out the unit of measurement; only use numerals with measurements when it is frequent in a paper. For example:


“25 percent.”
“34 feet (10.4 m)” or “seventy-five meters.”

, Make your sentences consistent when numbers are mixed. For example:


“The case held 25 pies, 36 cakes, 250 candy bars, and 300 sodas.”

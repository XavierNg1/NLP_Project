 Do not use this method for crystal wine glasses, or for wine glasses with long, delicate stems. Also, do not use this method for painted or glittered wine glasses.
 Do not load them in with anything that is very dirty or greasy. The grease can get on the glasses and smear them., Try to have about a hands width between each glass. This will lessen the chances of the glasses bumping against each other and chipping.
 The less detergent you use, the better. Also, try to use a mild, low-alkaline detergent. Do not add any rinse-aid. Rinse-aid may help prevent water stains, but it will also leave behind a chemical residue that will affect the flavor of your next glass of wine.If the wine glasses are stained, consider adding half a wine glass of white vinegar into the wash cycle., If you can, try to use a lower water temperature setting as well. The higher the water temperature, the more likely your wine glasses will be to crack.
 Instead, open the door at the end of the cycle to let the glasses air dry without humidity., Gently wipe them dry with a soft, lint-free cloth (such as microfiber), and put them away.

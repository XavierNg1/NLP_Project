 If you are going to strike with your right hand, then your left leg should be in front of your other leg. Keep your knee slightly bent and your left leg back. Feel a loose bounce in the stance.;
, Pull your right elbow in close to your body with your fist clenched as if you are about to punch. Your body should be facing to the right. Then, practice twisting your upper body to face your opponent. This will give your punch more force.
 Right before you throw the punch, tighten your body. Remember to breathe. This will focus your body and tighten your muscles releasing more power. Also it keeps you calm and this will help in the event of a continued confrontation.
 Hitting your opponent in the jaw or chin is more likely to cause a knockout.There are one of two ways you can hit the jaw:











Uppercut. This is where you target the jaw with your fist by coming straight up, minimizing lateral movement. You want the recipient's head to snap straight up.

Sideswipe. This is where you target the jaw with your fist by coming from the side. You want the recipient's head to snap to the side, causing a blackout.
 Remember that you will generate more force with a hit by twisting your hips while you move into the target. Baseball players also use this strategy to generate more force when they swing the bat.
 Your goal is to clip the target's jaw from the bottom or on the side. If performing the Sideswipe, make sure your range of motion is a bit curved. You want the path of your punch to be more circular than linear.

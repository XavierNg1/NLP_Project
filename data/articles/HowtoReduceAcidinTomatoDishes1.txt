 Most dishes will require you to cut up the tomatoes anyway. You can choose how large or small you want the chunks to be depending on what you are making.


Note that smaller pieces will heat through more quickly.;
, If you are going to add the tomatoes into another hot dish, you may not need to cook them for as long. If you cut bigger chunks, you may need to cook them a little longer.Be sure to watch the tomatoes carefully so that you can remove them from heat if they start to burn or become too crispy.
 This amount works well for six medium tomatoes, so for more or less tomatoes you can adjust the amount of baking soda. Stir the baking soda so that all the pieces of tomato get a slight coating.The baking soda will fizz as it reacts with the acid of the tomatoes.
 Once the fizzing has stopped, which may take a minute or so, finish cooking the dish. The baking soda will reduce the overall acid content of the dish and does not usually alter the taste of the dish.

 Your second chakra is tied to the color orange, and focusing your mind on the color will help balance, heal, and maintain your sacral chakra. While meditating, focus on “sending” the color orange to the area of your lower abdomen (where the second chakra is located).Wear small pieces of orange-colored gemstone jewelry. This will keep the color near your body, and help balance your chakra. Look for gems such as: citrine, fire opal, and tangerine quartz., These are powerful objects to influence and help balance your sacral chakra. It’s important to have these near you if your sacral chakra is blocked; you can also place the crystals or stones on your body.


Use orange-colored healing stones, as these will have the greatest effect on your sacral chakra. These stones include carnelian and orange calcite.Moonstone is also associated with the sacral chakra, due to its affiliation with water. Healing moonstones will help balance this chakra., The element associated with the second chakra is water, so spending time in or around water will calm and balance your sacral chakra. Water will relax you, calm your mind, and help you meditate.Visit a lake, stream, river, or even the ocean. This will be most effective if you can spend time alone, in meditation, near a body of water. If you can, dangle your feet into the water or wade out into it.
If you’re not around large bodies of water, taking a long shower or bath will have a similar effect.

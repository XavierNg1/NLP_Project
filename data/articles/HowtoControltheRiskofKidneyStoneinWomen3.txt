 Not all kidney stones form as a result of lifestyle or medicine usage.


Chronic kidney infections can lead to struvite stones. Long-term antibiotic use may be required to prevent these stones from forming regularly.
Some stones form due to a genetic disorder called cystinuria which causes an overproduction of the chemical cystine in the urinary tract. If left untreated, excess cystine can also develop into stones.Other disorders like hyperthyroidism, gout, and urinary tract infections can also increase your risk of developing kidney stones., Although anyone can get kidney stones (even children) the chances that you will develop them go up between the ages of 20 and 40.Common risk factors like over-consumption of oxalate are much worse for older women than younger women.Postmenopausal women with low estrogen levels are more likely to develop stones.
 If one of your immediate relatives has had a kidney stone, you are 60% more likely to develop a stone. Once you develop one kidney stone, your odds of developing another also rise by about 60%.
People with only one kidney are also at an increased risk.

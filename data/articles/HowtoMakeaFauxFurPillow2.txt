 Making a faux fur pillow cover is even easier than making a faux fur pillow, but you will get the same effect. To make a faux fur pillow cover, you will need:Standard size pillow
Enough faux fur fabric to cover the pillow and overlap slightly
Pins
Sewing machine

, Take the fabric and wrap it around the longest sides of your pillow. The fabric should overlap by a few inches in the back. Make sure that the raw edges of the overlapping fabric are both on the same side of the pillow. This will serve as the opening to your pillow case.The fabric should be fitted, but not too tight.
If needed you can trim the fabric to better fit your pillow, but be careful. Make sure that you avoid cutting through any of the fur fibers as you cut.
 Pin the fabric to hold it in place. Although you will be sewing along the short edges, pinning along the long edges or pinning the area where the fabric overlaps itself is a better strategy. This way you will be able to slide the fabric off the pillow before you sew., Remove the fabric from the pillow while keeping it in the overlapping position. Do not turn it inside out! The fur should remain facing in until you finish sewing.To sew your pillowcase, sew along the short edges of the faux fur fabric. You can use a simple straight stitch to do this. Sew across each edge two times to ensure that it is secured.
Remove the pins after you finish sewing, or as needed to sew through the fabric.
 After you finish sewing, turn the pillowcase right side out to reveal the furry side. Then, slip the pillow through the opening in the pillow case. Arrange the flaps to ensure that the pillow is completely covered by the fur pillow case.Place the pillow with the flap side facing down so that it is hidden.

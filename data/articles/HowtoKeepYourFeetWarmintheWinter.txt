, It is recommended that you wear two layers of socks but that's up to you. You might also consider purchasing socks especially designed to keep the feet toasty warm outdoors; check out the options in a sports or outdoor store, and ask for socks that keep the feet warm. Many of these socks are designed to be warm without adding too much bulk, allowing you to wear your boots or shoes comfortably.
 Check the warmth rating of your boots, as the specific cold weather boots will have a special rating that corresponds to temperature ranges. Ensure that the boots fit you well, as this will help to keep you warm.
 With luck, your feet will stay toasty warm.
 Choose nice warm, fluffy ones that feel comfortable to wear for the time you'll be sitting around.
 These will add more warmth to your feet.
 Keep them there until the heat has warmed up your feet, then put your warmed feet under a blanket.


Be careful not to put any clothing too close to a radiator or open fire.
 Wrap the bottle or heat pack in a thin blanket to help the heat last longer.


Keep the hot water bottle or heat pack off a wooden, cement or stone floor; place on a cushion or carpeted area first, otherwise the heat will drain quickly.
 The warm water will help them to warm up and you can pop on some socks as soon as you get out of the shower, to keep them nice and warm.

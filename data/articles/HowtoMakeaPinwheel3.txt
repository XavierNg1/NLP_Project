 Draw or print a hexagon directly on the paper you will be using. Cut the hexagon out using a pair of scissors or a metal ruler and a sharp blade., Use a ruler and a pencil to trace lines from corner-to-corner on you hexagon. When you are done, you will have a * shape in the center., Stop when you are about a third of the way from the center. Do not cut across the lines all the way to the middle, or the hexagon will fall apart., Start at the top, and work your way around in a circle until you are back where you are started. Make sure that the corners overlap in the middle of the pinwheel. Do not crease or bend the paper, however; you want to keep those nice curves!, Make sure that you catch all of the folded-over corners. Have the tip of the pin come out the back of the pinwheel. Wiggle the pin a little to help widen and loosen the hole., You only need 1 to 3 beads. These will help lift the pinwheel away from the dowel and allow it to spin. Avoid using large beads, like pony beads, however., Use a thumbtack to punch a hole in the dowel, Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the tip. If you need to, use a hammer to help drive the thumbtack into dowel, then pull the thumbtack out., Give the pinwheel a test spin. If it gets stuck, pull the pushpin out a little further. If the pushpin comes out of the back of the dowel, bend it down with some pliers or a hammer. If the pin is too loose, pull it out, add some glue into the hole, then push it back in again.

 Make sure you have different types. Eating the same type can get a little boring. You may also feel sick and that's not good. Get about two or three different kinds of candy.;
, When you have got the candy, you need a hiding place for it. You can f. ex. put it in a basket and put a small blanket over it and hide it under your bed. But you can probably think of a better way. We all have different room set ups so what ever is best for you and your friend(s).
 Now you need some drinks. If you are going to have pop then only have a little. Yes pop does have caffeine in it but also a lot of sugar that could give you a sugar high or it will just make you crash. Some healthier drinks would be juice, everybody likes juice! And the healthiest drink: Water. Wouldn't you like a refreshing glass of water?

, Include any exits space you have such as closets, pantries, and lofts. You will need a map because you should be sneaking around in the house and be grabbing some midnight snacks, but if you make noises your parents might wake up and wonder what that bang was so, if that ever happened, just dash into a hiding spot.
 The first thing that comes into your mind right now must be electronics. Yes a great sleepover need electronics but... the light will make you a bit sleepy so why not board games? There are many games! Clue! Life! Scrabble! Bop it! Play games like those if you own them, and if you don't chicken out, play a Ouija board. (wee- jee board) If you don't know what a Ouija board is, then I recommend going to Google and type the museum of Ouija board. Or play an online Ouija board.
 Turn off the lights and grab a flash light, its time for scary stories.
 Somebody is it and now you justÂ go hide until your friend finds you.
 You can download IMovie, video f. ex. live, horror movie maker and other video making apps. Decide the topic and play along.
 The cold water will wake you up.
 Those are always fun when it gets really late.

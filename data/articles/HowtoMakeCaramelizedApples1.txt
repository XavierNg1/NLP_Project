 Make sure you select an apple that is strong enough to maintain shape as it caramelizes. Use varieties such as Braeburn, Fuji, Gala, Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, Jonagold, or Pink Lady. Avoid softer varieties, which may break apart during the cooking process and leave you with caramelized mush instead of apple slices., First, remove the skins. Then quarter your apples. Cut the core free from whichever quarter it clings to. Then slice the quarters into slices roughly a half-inch thick (1.2 cm.)If desired, cut the slices into cubes with half-inch sides.If you prefer even thinner slices, aim for a quarter-inch thickness.This should still be thick enough to handle without breaking them.
 Make sure your apples brown from cooking and not from exposing their flesh to the open air. If you expect a delay between slicing them and cooking them, prepare a bath of cold lemon water for the slices to soak in for 5 to 10 minutes.To make 8 ounces of lemon water, mix Â½ cup lemon juice with 3 tablespoons of boiled water and then make up the difference with cold water., If you soaked your slices in a lemon-water bath, or if they appear to be excessively juicy, use a paper towel to softly soak up the moisture by gently patting them.Expect the addition of water to the hot, bubbling butter in your skillet to possibly cause the heated liquid to pop into the air. Reduce the risk of scalding yourself by minimizing the amount of added moisture the best you can.
 If you prefer your apples with a thicker syrup, use cornstarch to beef it up. Mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 3 tablespoons of water until the starch dissolves. Stir this into your caramelized apples and then reduce the heat to low. Allow your apples to continue cooking over lower heat while the syrup thickens.

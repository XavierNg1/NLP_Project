 Set up your projector, screen, and tripod and digitally photograph your image as it is displayed on the screen. If there is a manual focus on your camera, use it to adjust for the distance to ensure the image is as sharp as possible.


If your camera permits, try bracketing your image exposure with slower and faster shutter times and a fixed f-stop, and then compositing the picture with image software such as Photoshop. The resolution will still be compromised, but you may have better dynamic range.
 Either zoom in or use the macro function of your digital camera to take a picture of the back-lit slide. The peripheral light present around the slide itself may need to be blocked/blacked out. Use some cardstock or paper and place it so that only the slide's image has any visible light behind it. This process typically requires a tripod to make a sharp image.
 If your lens permits you to focus within an inch of the lens, use a stand to take a close-up image of the slide. Capture is quick with a click of the camera's shutter. You can test your camera for slide, negative copying at www.shotcopy.com/compatibility.htm and build your own copy stand if you choose.

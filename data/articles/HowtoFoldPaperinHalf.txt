 If you want to get a good fold, you must make sure the paper is even, doesn't have any cuts, wrinkles, or wet spots.



;
,, Lift the other edge of the piece of paper about one inch off of the folding surface. (Be careful not to rip it.) Carefully pull that corner over to the opposite side of the paper. Make sure the corners line up. You will notice that if you let go of the corner at this point the paper will go back to normal.
 Carefully apply downward force onto the bend by sliding your finger down the bend, and be sure not to rip the paper with your fingernail. Ensure a good crease by going over the fold with the back of your fingernail (still being careful not to rip it). If you have done this correctly, your paper should be symmetrical, and it should seem half the size of the original unbent paper.
 You've folded a piece of paper!

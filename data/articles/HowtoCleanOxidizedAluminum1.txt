 Begin the process of cleaning oxidized aluminum by rinsing the aluminum to remove surface dust or debris. If you are cleaning an aluminum pot or pan, rinse the pan under a strong jet of water. If you are cleaning aluminum wheels or house siding, use a damp cloth to wipe the aluminum or a hose to it with water., If your aluminum looks clean after rinsing with water, move onto cleaning the aluminum with natural cleaners. If it is still looking dirty or there is debris caked up over the oxidation, wash the aluminum surface with hot water, soap, and a soft bristled brush or scratchy pad., To remove stubborn dirt or food buildup on your aluminum, use hot water and a flat edge to scrape buildup off of the surface. If you are cleaning an aluminum pot, place a few inches of water in the bottom, put the pot on the stove, and bring it to a boil for about five minutes. Then take the pot off the stove, wait for the water to cool slightly and use a flat-edge spatula to scrape off the buildup with the water still inside.If you are washing aluminum wheels or siding, soak a cloth in hot water and hold it against the buildup to loosen it, then use a flat spatula to scrape it off.

Divide your hair into two sections.
Twist one side tight and hold it in place with a clip and repeat on next side.
Being careful not to let go of the two strands of hair, pull together and tie into ponytail.
When you have done that, you should have a slight gap or hole between the twists just at the top of the elastic. Pull rest of the ponytail into the gap and pin in place.


Take two sections on each side of your head before your ears reach.
Brush one side back and plait or twist (depending which suits you) and clip in place.
Repeat on both sides.
Tie at the back of your head. The higher the better to create the princess crown look.


Clips can give your hair dimension and style. Try pulling your hair back and adding butterfly or flower shaped clips.
Bows and ribbons can make your hair look shiny and pretty especially if it is a large bow at the back of your hair.
Headbands can be so pretty on short hair and make your hair look fuller if pulled all the way back. Also ones with flowers, bows, and so on on them can add height to the headband.

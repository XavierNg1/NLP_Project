 When reading a new pattern, crocheters familiar with American terms may be confused when reading a written pattern and seeing "tension," while British crocheters will feel the same when they see "gauge." However, they actually are synonymous.;
, Various types of stitches have different names. In order to avoid mistakes, you need to know if your pattern is American or British. A simple way to handle the difference is to remember that British stitches are one step up from American stitches. An American single crochet identical to a British double crochet, which makes a British single crochet an American chain stitch.


Facing an entire written pattern with a terminology you're not familiar with can be daunting. The chart below will help you remember.
 As daunting as it may seem, if you need to translate from one terminology to another, the easiest way would be to rewrite the pattern for yourself. If it's not too daunting with rows and rows of different directions and repeats, it's easier to just sit down, rewrite it, and translate it yourself.


At the very least, you should be completely comfortable with the pattern before you even start. This makes for an easier and quicker project with a fewer chance of making mistakes.
 Translating on the fly can bend your brain in ways you never thought it could, and mistakes are easy to make if you're not careful. If you're not completely comfortable doing this, don't set yourself up for failure by trying to do more than you're comfortable with.

Success will come easily through practice, just as your comfort and speed with crocheting get better the more you do it.

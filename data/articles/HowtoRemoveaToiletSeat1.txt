 These are located at the back of the seat, where the seat hinges. Some toilets may not have plastic covers for the bolts. If yours does, open these covers by prying upwards on them with your finger or a screwdriver.


Use light pressure when opening the bolt covers. Generally, it takes little pressure to open these, and using too much force may cause damage to them.;
, You should find a nut screwed onto the threaded end of each bolt. Some nuts may have a shape similar to a wing nut, allowing you to hold it in place by hand. If you have a weak grip, the nut is not wing nut shaped, or the nut is stuck, try gripping it with a pair of pliers.


The fasteners of your toilet seat may be plastic. Use light to moderate pressure when removing plastic hardware to keep it from breaking or deforming., In most cases, you’ll need to unscrew bolts with a standard screwdriver. While holding the nut on the threaded end of the bolt, insert your screwdriver into the bolt head and turn it counterclockwise to unscrew the bolt.


Screwdrivers that are too small can cause the bolt head to deform, especially if the bolt is plastic. Use the largest size screwdriver that will fit your bolt head for best results., Collect the nuts, bolts, and any loose plastic or metal hardware (like the bolt covers) that also goes with the seat. Put these small pieces into a sealable plastic bag and tape them to the seat so they don’t become lost. Your toilet seat is removed, now you can install a new one.

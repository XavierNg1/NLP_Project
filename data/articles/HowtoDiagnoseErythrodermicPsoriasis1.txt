 If you suspect that you have erythrodermic psoriasis, then it is recommended that you contact a dermatologist immediately. This form of psoriasis can be life threatening if it is severe, or if it is left untreated.Describe your symptoms to your doctor, for example, "A large portion of my body is covered in a red rash that is painful, it burns."
Because it is a disease of the skin, your body will not be able to insulate itself very well, so tell your doctor if you are experiencing shivering episodes.
Tell your doctor about any swelling in your ankles, as well.;
, Your doctor should be able to identify it by looking at the presentation of the disease. If your doctor determines that it has been caused by a history of psoriasis, the doctor will look for the presence of complications. Additionally, your doctor may also run blood tests, for example, CBC, ESR, BUN, creatinine, LFTs, TB and HIV screening, inflammatory markers, and blood cultures, to look for other complications.Other complications can include acute kidney injury, anaemia, hypoalbuminemia, and infections.
 Treatment consists of symptom management, topical treatments, medication, IV fluids, antibiotics and rest. In the early stages of treatment, bed rest in a warm room, cool dressings, topical steroids and moisturizers are advised. You may also be prescribed antibiotics.In severe cases an IV or medication containing systemic steroids is administered, for example, methotrexate, acitretin, and cyclosporine.
To decrease inflammation, TNF-alpha blocking biologics are used like Enbrel, Humira, Remicade, and Simponi.
Ask your doctor, "What kind of treatment do you recommend for patients with my stage of erythrodermic psoriasis?" and "What are the pros and cons of taking systemic steroids in addition to topical treatments?"

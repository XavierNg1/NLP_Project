 There are three numbers on the label, showing the percentage of nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium – the main nutrients your lawn needs in order to thrive and flourish. A bag that reads 20-5-10 (20% nitrogen, 5% phosphate, 10% potassium) is the perfect starter mix to apply to your lawn during the spring., Slow release fertilizers release nutrients gradually over time. Fertilize the lawn every 6 to 8 weeks. Give the lawn 2-3 pounds of fertilizer over the duration of the lawn’s growing season.,


Keep in mind that if you choose to use a granular fertilizer, before you apply it, the ground needs a quarter inch of water to wet it before the fertilizer gets laid down., The perfect time of year to begin fertilizer application is the middle of April. The amount of feedings should total up to 5 by the end of the grass’s growing season.The second fertilizer feeding should occur 4 weeks later, around mid-May. Subsequent feedings should occur every 6-8 weeks after that until November hits.
On the third feeding, don’t use the 20-5-10 slow burning granular fertilizer you chose, instead give the ground an organic feeding of manure.Watering your lawn will dictate how much time occurs in between feedings for the 3rd through 5th applications. If your lawn receives routine watering through a sprinkler system, you will need to fertilize the lawn every 6 weeks. If you don’t have a sprinkler, the wait in between feedings can be 8 weeks.
 Any loose granules left on one spot on the ground can burn and/or kill the grass. Disperse the fertilizer onto your lawn by mowing the lawn with the spreader.Start by applying half of what the bag recommends for the first fertilizer feeding. This helps prevent over application which can do more harm than good to your lawn.
Begin by covering the yard’s perimeter and then work your way to filling in the middle.

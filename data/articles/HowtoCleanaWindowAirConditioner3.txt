 Place the unit on a table outside within reach of a hose. Take off the front panel and side fins that attach to the window. Remove the screws that attach the casing to the unit, store them in a safe place, and carefully slide off the casing.Choose a warm, sunny day to deep clean your air conditioner outside.
 Use an air conditioner coil cleaner or an oxygenated household cleaner. You can also mix warm water with a few drops of dish detergent. Spray the front panel, case, and window fins with the cleaner.Then spray the interior coils, fan, aluminum fins, and interior base.Let the parts soak for about 10 minutes.
 Use a soft bristle brush to gently scrub all the parts you sprayed with cleaning solution. If you encounter stubborn grime, such as around the fan blades, spray the areas again and let them soak for another few minutes. Then give them another scrub with your soft bristled brush., Set your hose on low pressure, as high pressure could damage the coils or aluminum fins. Spray down the exterior panel, casing, and window fins. Then hose down the coils, fan, and aluminum fins. Tilt the unit to spray and drain the interior base.Avoid getting the control panel wet when you hose down the unit.

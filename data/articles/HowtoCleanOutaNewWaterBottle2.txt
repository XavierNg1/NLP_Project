 If you use your water bottle each day, it's important you wash it after every use. This will prevent the water bottle from building up unwanted gunk and mold.If you can wash your water bottle in the dishwasher, throw it in with your regular dishes at the end of each day.
If your water bottle cannot be used in the dishwasher, wash it with soap and water each day and then let it air dry.
 Many people forget a water bottle's cap also needs washing. Caps can build up a lot of gunk over time, leaving them slimy. Throw the cap in with a load of dishes or hand wash your bottle cap each day., If your bottle is beginning to build up a smell again, or if a lot of gunk is building up in the bottle, a deeper clean may be necessary. You can deep clean a water bottle using white vinegar.After cleaning your water bottle like you usually would, fill it a fifth of the way full with white vinegar.
From there, add water until the bottle is full.
Let your bottle sit out overnight and then rinse it out in the morning.

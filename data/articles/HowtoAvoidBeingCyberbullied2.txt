 Bullies thrive on making people upset. If you can ignore them, they won't get this satisfaction. This should be your first line of defense, and will prevent many cases of cyberbullying.Ignore the bully only if it's a first-time, mild comment or action online.
If the bully’s actions are repeated or severe, respond.
 If someone says something cruel online, it's tempting to say something mean about them. Trying to get even rarely works with a cyber bully, however. “Trolls” feed on people getting upset at their harassing comments and posts online. Don’t give them that satisfaction., If you've had problems with someone, even if you don't consider it full-fledged bullying, you could just cut off all online contact with them. Email services, social media, phone service providers, and other outlets all provide ways to block particular users., On the other hand, if a bully is bothering you, it's easy for you to keep a record of the harassment. Keep copies of any emails or texts, take screenshots of any messages, etc. That way, if you need to show that bullying took place, you'll have proof that can stop the bully., Whether you've been the target of bullying, feel you're at risk for being bullied, or just want to stop the problem in general, let someone else know what's going on. If you’re underage, talk to an adult, like a parent or school counselor. Otherwise, talk to a friend or mentor for support.

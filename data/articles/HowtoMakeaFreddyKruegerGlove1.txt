 Gather all of the supplies together that you will need to make your glove. You can find the list of things you will need near the end of the page.


It doesn't matter if the glove is a righty or lefty. Freddy wore his glove on the right, but you can wear it on the left if it will be more comfortable for you.
Choose whatever color glove you like. Brown is a good choice, if you want it to look more authentic.;
, Make sure you can only see the silver side. In other words, put the bland, pale sides to each other so you don't see them.


Glue or tape the sheets of silver paper together securely so the paper won't slide around while you are trying to cut it.
 Create four pairs of two pieces of silver paper each. Then cut a 1 inch (2.5 cm) gap at the beginning of each blade in every pair so there are little "arms". You will need to do this or you will not be able to attach your blades to the fingers of the glove.


The blades should be long, thin, and slightly curved. Cut them out into a banana-like shape, with one that is very pointy.
The arms will allow you to glue each arm to each side of the gloves finger.
If you want, you can stroke the end of the blades with a red permanent marker and add dots for a splattered blood effect.
 Make sure they are even. Then tape the blades together so they cover the stick.
 Then duct tape the sides of the blade to the fingers to sturdy them. Only make the side strip 2 inches (5.1 cm). Then repeat until all four fingers have blades.


Consider painting the duct tape to match the color of the glove.

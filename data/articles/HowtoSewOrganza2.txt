 Sheers like organza are fancy enough on their own, so it is not necessary to use an intricate design when you are working with them. Instead, opt for simple designs that will showcase the fabric.For example, you might want to avoid things like pleating and intricate draping.
 If you anticipate needing to wash it later on, then it is important to do a pre-wash before sewing to ensure that the fabric will not shrink after you sew it.Keep in mind that it is generally best not to wash organza, so if you do not anticipate needing to wash it, then donâ€™t pre-wash it.Also, be aware that pre-washing organza will soften the fabric, so it may not provide the same amount of structure before it has been washed., If your fabric is wrinkled or creased, then you may want to press it before you sew. However, the steam from an iron can leave water spots or cause discoloration to organza fabric. Use a dry iron to press the fabric if needed.Make sure that the iron is on the lowest setting., Organza is slippery, so it is important to weigh it down to prevent it from moving while you measure and cut it. You can use weights, push pins, or tape to hold down your fabric.Try using double sided tape to attach the organza to your work surface.Keep in mind that pinning can damage the fabric, so use them sparingly, if at all., Organza can get stained easily, so avoid using a marker or anything else that might not come off the fabric easily. A pencil, pen, or piece of chalk will probably work best for marking.Test out your marking method on a scrap piece of fabric first to see if it will come out easily.

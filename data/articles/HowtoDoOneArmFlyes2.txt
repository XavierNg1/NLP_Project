 To do a standing one arm flye, stand up straight. Hold the dumbbell in your hand. Raise your arm out to your side like a bird extending its wing. Your palm should be facing forward. Make sure there is a slight bend to your elbow.








Make sure your feet are shoulder width apart.
Due to the different position, you may not be able to use the same weight as with a supine one arm chest flye.
 Keeping your arm parallel to the floor, bring the weight towards the middle of the chest, squeezing your chest muscles as you do. Inhale as you complete this movement.








Try not to let your arm sag down. If that happens, lower the weight.
 Don't cross over your chest. Instead, stop when your arm is in a straight line in front of you. The path that your arm takes should be in the same line the entire time. Don't move your upper body or twist. Only your shoulder joint should be moving.









Make sure to keep a slight bend at the elbow.
 After a brief pause in front of your chest, exhale as you bring the weight back up to the starting position. Keep the slight bend to your elbow and make sure your arm travels in the same path. Keep your arm straight out to your side.
 Complete a certain number of repetitions with one arm. Then, you can change arms. Follow the same steps with the other arm. Do the same number of repetitions with each arm.

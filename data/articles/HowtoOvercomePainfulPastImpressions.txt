 You have to learn to let go of the sadness or negativity, but this can only be achieved by forgetting and forgiving.;
, All of us have positive things in our life, we just have to make sure that we get to know them. It is very easy to miss seeing the positivity in our existence and focus on the negativity, but this is the biggest mistake.
 When you help a person in need, you will feel good about yourself and see for yourself that everybody encounters problems in life. One more way for you to appreciate the good things in your life.
 Having people to share your problems with should help you overcome them easier.
 If these things make you feel good about yourself do them, but keep in mind that they should be healthy both for your body and mind. Things such as a healthy diet and a safe hobby are highly recommended. Keep in mind that most of the time our emotions are affected by our unhealthy way of life. A healthy body will have a healthy mind.
 Remember that nobody is perfect, including you. If a person has upset you in the past, he has done it because he is not perfect. Put yourself in their shoes and think about the way you would have had reacted. There is a good chance that you might have done the same exact thing or worse.
 Achievements are very helpful to overcome negative thoughts and experiences.

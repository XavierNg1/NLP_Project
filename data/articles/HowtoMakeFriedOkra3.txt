 Place the okra in a colander and rinse it under cool, running water. After removing the okra from the water, let the excess moisture drain for at least 30 seconds.


When stir-frying okra, it needs to be very dry. You may need to wipe it dry with clean paper towels before continuing.
 Cut off the head and tail of the okra, if necessary, and slice it down the center. Cut each lengthwise half into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces.


If you havenâ€™t done so already, you should also cut up the onion and green chili pepper. The onion should be cut into thin slices, while the green chili pepper should be minced into small pieces., Pour 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of vegetable oil into a large skillet. Allow the oil to warm up on the stove over medium-high heat for approximately 30 seconds.
 Place the two ingredients in the hot oil. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 2 minutes or until the onions begin turning translucent.


You should also notice a stronger aroma coming from the onion and green chili pepper. This aroma signifies that the flavor of the two ingredients has been infused into the cooking oil.
 Place the sliced okra in the pan alongside the onion and green chili. Sprinkle it with the salt, turmeric, and red chili pepper, then toss to combine.
 Cook the contents of the skillet, stirring frequently, for another 6 to 9 minutes.The okra should be cooked through after about 6 minutes, but it may retain a slimy texture. Cooking it for several more minutes should make it crispier.
Note, however, that cooking the okra too long could cause it to lose much of its color and nutrients.
 Transfer the stir-fried okra to serving plates and enjoy it while it's still hot.

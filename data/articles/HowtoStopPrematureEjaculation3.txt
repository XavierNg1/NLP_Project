 If you routinely ejaculate less than a minute and a half after beginning vaginal intercourse, and none of the above fixes have worked, it might be time to see a medical professional. You can visit a urologist, sex therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist for help.
 The treatment that your doctor recommends will depend on your age, overall health and sexual history, but here's a rundown of the most common routes:13.jpg|center]]

A topical medication containing an anesthetic applied directly onto the penis which reduces penile sensitivity. A couple of topical over-the-counter medications are now available on the market in the US; a urologist can help you decide between the options.
A short-acting SSRI: Researchers suspect serotonin has an effect on ejaculation, and have found a certain class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can help delay it.
A mild oral analgesic.
A tri-cyclic anti-depressant.
Intracavernous vasodilator therapy: In extreme cases, your doctor might suggest injecting a vasodilator directly into your penis before intercourse. Though this is usually a successful option, it's not something to start lightly.
Psychological sex therapy. If your doctor believes your PE is mental or emotional in origin, they may recommend therapy with a counselor to discuss, unravel and overcome your sexual anxieties or hangups.

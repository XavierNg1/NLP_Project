 For a more specific people search engine look to sites like Wink.com and http://find-people-free-search.com. You can also use a free friend-finder board like the one at http://consumer-warning.org/lost-friends-board.;
, These sites can automatically find classmates if you provide educational information . You can also run a search in a blog search engine (most general search engines have an option for running a blog search.)

, Many of these sites offer a certain amount of information for free, but require a small fee for more detailed searches. Some popular sites are www.Reunion.com, www.FreeAlumniFinders.com, and www.Classmates.com # Contact the alumni office at your school. Most schools, especially colleges, maintain up-to-date alumni records and are often times a great resource for getting contact information for an old classmate.
 Someone might still be in contact with them and they could give you the person’s contact information

, There is a chance that they or their parents might still be living in the same house or still have the same phone number. Try it; it’s worth a shot.

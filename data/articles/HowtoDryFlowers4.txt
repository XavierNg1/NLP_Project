 Cut a piece of chicken-wire or fine-mesh wire in a big enough size for all your flowers to fit. Then, slide the stems through the holes in the wire, so that the bud holds the body of the flower up while the stem dangles below.


The best flowers to be oven-dried are compact, with many-petals. These include cornflowers and chrysanthemums.
 With your convection oven heated to 100ºF (38ºC), put the wire with the flowers onto the rack. The low heat will dry the flowers slowly; leave them in the oven for several hours.The total drying time will vary based on the type and number of flowers you used.


A well-ventilated convection oven will do the best job. Do not try this with a normal oven. Normal ovens contain too much moisture and usually have a minimum temperature much higher than 100ºF (38ºC).
 Once the flowers have dried completely, you can remove them from the oven and set them on a drying rack to cool down. Wait until they are back to room temperature before handling.


Apply hairspray or floral sealant for sturdier, longer-lasting dried flowers.

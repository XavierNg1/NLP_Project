 The belts should lie flat across your upper chest and your upper thigh areas. If your belt becomes twisted, fold it lengthwise so that it's flattened for about 12 inches (30Â cm) below the buckle. Pull the buckle over the folded area and turn it the right way around.This might require some patience, but it's well worth your time to protect your safety.
 If the strap feels like it's cutting into your neck, try moving your seat forward or backward. Newer cars allow you to correct this issue with a restraint system. If all else fails, purchase a padded seat belt cover. You can find these in most big box stores., If your belt is pulling you too tightly, part of it is probably stuck. Since each make and model is assembled differently, read your car user's manual for specific instructions. In many cases, pulling on the shoulder strap while the belt is unbuckled will do the trick. If this doesn't work and you're not trained in auto mechanics, take your car to your dealership if it's under warranty. If not, take it to a reputable mechanic.

Many of the fixes detailed online involve taking the seat belt apart. Don't attempt this unless you absolutely know what you're doing.

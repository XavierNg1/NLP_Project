 This is a great way to play for beginners, and you don't have to be as meticulous about keeping track of exactly what happened in every single round. All you have to do is win more holes than your opponent. So, let's say that your score on the first hole was 5 and your opponent's score on the first hole was three; your opponent is now "one up" because your opponent is one hole ahead of you., If you're having an impossible time getting the ball into a hole during a certain round and would rather save your energy and sanity, then you can give up that hole and move on to the next. You get a clean start in the next hole.
 Continue to play and write down who has won each hole after every round. Just write +1 if you're up a hole for a certain round or -1 if you're down for that round. If you and your opponent got the ball in the hole with the same amount of strokes, you can write "AS" under the hole and consider it a draw.
 Matches can be one by scores of "four and three." This means that one player will win after being four holes ahead with only three holes remaining (after the 15th hole) since the other player will not have the opportunity to win back enough holes to win the round.
 If you're a beginner, it's more important to focus on getting the ball in the hole than being upset about taking too many shots. This way, you'll be more focused on falling into a rhythm than overanalyzing your game. As you become more advanced, you can work on marking down every one of your shots and making room for improvement.

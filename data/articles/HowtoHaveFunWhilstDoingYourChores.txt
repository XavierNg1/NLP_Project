 Turn on some upbeat music that you enjoy, or some inspirational music. That way you can sing along as you work. Get your mp3, CD player, laptop, or portable radio. If none of these are available, feel free to just sing to yourself. Clean to the beat of the song and think about how clean your house is going to be when you are done.;
, This will fill your home with lots of light and fresh air, which will make you feel good as you clean. Refreshing and healthy!

, Time yourself to see how fast you could go while still doing a good job. Just think of it as you were playing a game. Use your imagination and creativity, to make it a less daunting task. Give yourself points for every room you clean well and have your parents evaluate your work.
 Pretend you're a pirate ship's cook and you have to do the dishes. If you're older, then think about what homework you need to do, or think of the weekend and relaxing(chocolate, computer and holidays).
 Only take a break if you start to feel a little tired. You could have a snack, do a dance, whatever seems most fun, but don't have a long break. You need to keep at it!

, Be blunt and get rid of what you know you'll never use. If it can be used again, recycle or give it to charity. You'll feel good about yourself if you give to the people who are in need.
 This will motivate yourself to get the job done. Make your favorite dessert right after you finish your chores. You'll have something to look forward to when you are done.

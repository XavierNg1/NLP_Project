 (It's hard to explain but you'll see what I mean in the game) Then a message will come up saying the pet has flu (if it does, that is).,, Select flu medicine and hold the needle with your stylus on the pet until all the green medicine on the giant needle at the top of the page has drained out. Then a message will come up saying you need to do the treatment again tomorrow. Do this once a day, everyday for 3 days until the pet is cured.

Like worms and fleas keep the pet for 3 days but for 5 days if you want extra money (you should get it now so it won't be mentioned again).

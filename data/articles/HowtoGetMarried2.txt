 As a general rule of thumb, do not get married immediately after the engagement is announced. Instead, enjoy being engaged for a little while. With any luck, it is the only time you will ever be engaged in your entire life. Once you can both agree on a day, find a justice of the peace, notary public, or other legally-empowered person to perform your marriage. Call ahead and set up an appointment; it will give him or her something pleasant to look forward to that day.
 Arrive to the site of your ceremony early, and bring at least one witness along. Dress up or not as you like it: Only the two of you, the master of the ceremony, and your witness(es) will be there to see.
 Follow the lead of the official and exchange vows. Kiss your spouse when you are done! You can choose to get a marriage license the same day you get married, in most cases; fees vary by state, but are not usually very expensive. The license gives you legal proof of your marriage for tax and other purposes. Once you have it, you do not need to renew it.

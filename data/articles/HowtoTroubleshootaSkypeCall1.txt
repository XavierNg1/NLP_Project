 It’s possible that the wrong audio output is selected in your Skype audio settings. If you can hear your friend but not clearly, see Poor Call Quality instead.


Windows: Click “Tools” and then “Options,” then click “Audio settings” on the left. Choose the correct speakers from the “Speakers” drop-down, then click “Save.”
Mac: Click “Preferences” in the Skype menu (at the top of the screen) and make sure the proper speakers are selected next to “Speakers.”;
, If your headphones or speaker are wireless, make sure they are charged.
 Especially if the room or area you’re in is not completely silent, you may have to raise the volume on your computer speakers, mobile phone, or headset to hear your friend speak.Some headphones and headsets have volume controls on the earpiece.
If you’re using a mobile phone on speakerphone mode, try switching to handset mode to see if you can hear that way. Tap the video icon to turn off the video portion of the call, and then tap the speakerphone icon.
 If you’re using a computer, trying playing a song in iTunes or a video on YouTube. If you can hear sound, your playback device is functioning properly.If you can’t hear sound anywhere on your computer, see Fix the Sound on a Mac Computer and How to Resolve No Sound on a Windows Computer.
 Skype’s Echo service allows you to make a test call to test your speaker and/or microphone for problems.


Find “Echo/Sound Test Service” in your Skype contacts (or search for “echo123” in the search field) and click (or tap) to open its profile.
Select “Call” on Echo’s profile. When the call is answered, you should hear a prompt to record a message. If you hear the prompt, your Skype audio is working properly. The problem is likely with your friend’s microphone.
 If you are still unable to hear your friend over Skype, it’s likely that the issue is on their end. Have them perform the steps in Your Friend Can’t Hear You At All.

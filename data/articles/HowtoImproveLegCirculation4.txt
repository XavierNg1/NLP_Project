 If lifestyle changes and healthy habits don't seem to be working, you may have a more serious health problem called peripheral artery disease. Talk with your doctor about whether this could be the case, and what treatment options are available to you.Peripheral artery disease occurs when plaque builds up in the arteries and prevents blood from circulating from the feet and legs to the heart. It leads to leg pain and other symptoms of poor circulation.Peripheral artery disease is generally treated with medication to combat leg pain, lower blood pressure and reduce cholesterol.
Peripheral artery disease is also sometimes treated with heart surgery.

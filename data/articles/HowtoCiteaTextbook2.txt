 Place the in-text citation in parentheses, as soon as possible after the quote or clause being referenced. As with APA style, punctuation goes outside the parentheses. Include the following, unless you can work them into the text, in which case there is no need to repeat the information in the in-text citation:


Author's last name. If you cite multiple authors (of different textbooks) with the same last name, include first initials or, if necessary, full first names. If the textbook was written by multiple authors, as is often the case, list all authors' last names in the order they appear on the title page.
Page or page range being cited. Do not place a comma between the author's name and the page numbers, and do not preface the page numbers with "p." as in an APA-style in-text citation. Examples: (Doe 42), (P. Smith 202), (R. Smith 16).
 Include all of the following information, or as much as is available to you, in the Works Cited entry for each textbook:


Author's name, last name first, ending with a period. If there are multiple authors, list them in the order they appear on the title page, separated by commas (including a terminal comma). Preface the last author's name with "and."
The textbook's title as it appears on the title page, written in italics. End with a period. If the book is not a first edition, include the edition number after the title, but not italicized. End with a period. Example: 2nd ed.
City of publication, followed by a colon, then the publisher's name, followed by a comma, then the year of publication followed by a period. For example: New York: Dover, 2003.
Include "Print." - the medium of publication - at the end of the listing.

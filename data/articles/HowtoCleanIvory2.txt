 If brushing the ivory and cleaning with an eraser don’t work to clean the ivory, you will need to do a deeper clean with soap and water. In a small bowl, pour in a few tablespoons of water. Then add in a squirt of mild soap and stir to mix the soap and water together., Dip a cotton ball swab or a Q-tip in the soapy water, then squeeze out any excess liquid and blot with a paper towel. Gently rub a small section of the ivory with the cotton ball or Q-tip. Don’t make the ivory too wet; try to just barely dampen the surface.You should notice that the section of ivory you cleaned looks whiter.
Use a Q-tip if you are working on small, delicate object or one that has a lot of intricate carving. Use a cotton ball if you are working on a large, smooth object.
 Keep dabbing the ivory with the Q-tip or cotton ball, working on small sections of the ivory at a time. If the Q-tip or cotton ball you are using ever becomes noticeably dirty, throw it away and use a new one.


Be sure not to cover the ivory with excess moisture. By the time you move on to the next section of ivory, the section that you just cleaned should be dry. If it is still wet, dry it with a clean cloth.
If your ivory object is cracked, make sure not to apply water above the fissured or porous surfaces.
Never soak a piece of ivory, as soaking can weaken and compromise the material by causing cracks and swelling., If you have cleaned correctly, the ivory object should look considerably cleaner and be dry. Before putting away the object, wipe it down with a clean, non-abrasive white cloth to be sure to soak up any excess moisture from the cleaning.

 Your puppy’s ear canals are L-shaped, and dirt and debris accumulate easily in the corner of the L. Therefore, you might want to clean your puppy’s ears with a solution once a month. Tilt your puppy’s head downward, and squirt a small amount of the solution into your puppy’s ear canal.Fill the ear canal with the solution, but do not overfill it. The ear should not be overflowing with solution.
Clean your puppy’s ears with a solution that is recommended by your veterinarian.
 For 20 to 30 seconds, gently massage the base of your puppy’s ear. This will help loosen any debris inside the ear canal. You may hear the solution swish around as you massage your puppy’s ear.Calm your puppy by petting and praising it in a soothing voice such as, "That's a good girl (or boy)."
Reward good behavior with a treat.
 Once you are done massaging, stand back and let your puppy shake the solution out of its ears. This will bring the softened wax and debris up and out of its ears. Then, use cotton balls to gently wipe away any debris and earwax.


Remember to wipe the earwax up and out of the ear., If your dog exhibits any signs of pain, i.e., whimpering or rubbing its ears, while you are cleaning, then stop cleaning and take it to the vet immediately. Take your puppy to the vet if it, or its ears, show any signs or symptoms of an ear infection, such as:Ear scratching, pawing at the ears, or wiping the ear on the floor or the furniture.
Brown, black, or bloody discharge.
Redness and/or swelling.
Head shaking or a head tilt.
Loss of balance, unusual eye movements, and/or walking around in circles.

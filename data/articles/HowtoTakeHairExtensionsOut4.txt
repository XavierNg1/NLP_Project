 Squeeze the clip and gently pull it away from your natural hair. Hold your natural hair against your scalp to prevent pulling or stressing your roots. Be careful not to let the clip snap on your fingers if the teeth are sharp.Work in sections around your head if you have more than one clip in.
When reapplying clip-in extensions, be sure to reposition them in different spots on your head. This will allow your scalp to relax from any wear and tear.
 Remove clip-in extensions before bed because they will cause your scalp discomfort, even on the softest pillow. Also, if your temporary extensions cannot be washed with regular shampoo or conditioner like natural hair, always be sure to take them out before showering.Lay your extensions out on a towel overnight or hang them up so that they stay straight.
Comb your fake hair once itâ€™s removed to prevent any tangling in storage.
 Moisture can help detangle any chunks of matted hair that have worked their way around clip-in extensions. Use a combination of a wide toothed comb and a spray bottle of water or a hair detangling product to coax the clips out.


If your temporary extensions cannot get wet, do not dampen them.

 Making marzipan is something you can do at home, or you can buy it pre-packaged.


Typical marzipan candy shapes are fruit shapes––little apples, oranges, pears, lemons, strawberries, etc. Flowers are another ideal way to shape marzipan. Marzipan candies include using marzipan as a stuffing inside dried fruit pieces or between two nuts.
Some more ideas include: Marzipan bunnies, marzipan toadstools and Christmas candy.
 Again, you can make fondant at home or buy it already made. Be aware that there are different types of fondant available, with varying levels of sugar and other ingredients, which affects softness, taste and durability. Ask the retailer for advice. Some may be more suited to covering cake than shaping as candies.


Typical fondant candies include round balls or cookie cutter shapes. Fondant candies are often flavored and may be covered in chocolate to form chocolate creams of varying flavors.
 Refer to the instructions of particular recipes for certainty; in some cases, the exact type of fondant (candy or cake) will impact whether it can be shaped.

 Choose the plant from a nursery or garden center.


If you're growing it from seed from an existing plant, sow the seed in autumn provided you're in a cold to cool climate. If you're in a temperate climate, mix the seed with sand and place it into the fridge for two months to chill before planting out. The chilling process promotes germination. (This is also called stratification.);
, This plant spreads and flattens as it grows, so select a broad sized container, preferably with a rounded shape.


Line the base of the container with pebbles or broken pieces of terracotta. Alternatively, use whatever else you normally add to the base of a container for this purpose.
 Ideal potting soil is one that allows for good drainage and has moderate richness. Add a handful of slow-release all-purpose fertiliser.


Water the container thoroughly before planting and allow all of the water to drain through first.
 Be sure that the top of the root ball is level with the surrounding soil. Firm in with your palms or heels. Water well.
 Keep this up until the tree is well established. Continue to add the all-purpose fertilizer every spring.
 The fir should be re-potted every three to four years to ensure vigorous continued growth.

 In some instances you should store vitamins or supplements in the fridge, but only if the label instructs you to do so. Although most vitamins and supplements should be stored at room temperature, there are some vitamins and supplements that require refrigeration.These include liquid vitamins, and some essential fatty acids and probiotics.
Probiotics contain active cultures that can die if exposed to heat, light or air, so it is essential that you refrigerate them.
Still, not all essential fatty acids, liquid vitamins and probiotics are required to be kept in the refrigerator, so it’s best to check the label first.
It is more likely that you will be instructed to store liquids in the fridge than other forms of vitamins or supplements.
Some multivitamins tablets are best kept in the fridge too., Make sure you secure the lid very tightly to avoid any moisture penetration. Leaving the lid loose in the refrigerator means exposing your supplements to excess moisture, which could seriously degrade the vitamins or supplements.Keep the container well out of the reach of any children or pets.
Even if they are in a childproof container, you should make sure that they are inaccessible.
 Put your supplements in a separate airtight container from foods to prevent any potential contamination. Perishable foods in the fridge could easily spoil, so it’s best to put vitamins and supplements in a separate airtight container.


If foods spoil nearby your supplements, any mould or bacteria could spread to them if they are not properly separated.
Remember to keep your vitamins and supplements in their original containers.
Airtight containers will not completely eliminate moisture, as you will let in moisture whenever you open the container.

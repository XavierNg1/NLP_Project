 Be firm about it. Say, “Thanks, but no thanks. Have a great day.” Remember there is nothing wrong with saying no, and you should work on being able to say it if you have trouble.Whether in a store, at your door, or over the phone, salespeople can and will take advantage if you feel bad for them. Don’t worry about hurting their feelings by saying no.
 Get stickers or signs that will let door-to-door salespeople you don’t answer uninvited knocks or solicitors. Check with your local government or neighborhood association to see if they have any official or uniform signs that you should post. In many areas, soliciting despite there being a clearly posted sign is a local code violation., If you’re nervous about saying no to someone, just relax and politely excuse yourself. Try saying, "I'm very happy with the brand I use now," "Oh, I have one of those already,” or "No I just don't need one of those right now."


Kids make a great excuse for just about anything - tell the salesperson you really have to get back to looking after the kids.
Say you’re cooking a meal, in the middle of a chore, on the phone, or something else that requires your immediate attention if you don’t want to just say no.
 If you don't want to be bothered, have posted no-knock signs, or are suspicious of door-to-door scams, don't open the door at all. In addition, if you're a senior, a teenager at home alone or babysitting youngsters, or in any similarly vulnerable position, avoid opening the door unless you are expecting someone you know and trust. Consider calling the police if you are aware of door-to-door scams happening in the area or if the person knocking won't leave.

 There is no obvious function in TSeries that does this, but the FillSampleValues function serves the same purpose by filling the series with a known number of points.


// load the data into a memory stream
ms->LoadFromFile("data");
// compute number of points
numpts = ms->Seek (0, soFromEnd)/sizeof(cd);
// pre-allocate space
Series1->FillSampleValues(numpts);
// load the data into the chart
ms->Position = ms->Seek(0, soFromBeginning);
for (unsigned i=0; i < numpts; i++)
{
ms->Read(&cd, numbytes);
Series1->XValues->Value= cd.x;
Series1->YValues->Value= cd.y;
};

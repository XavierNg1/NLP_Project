 If you suspect that your teen is being beaten by someone in their life, you will want to pay close attention to their dress code. While all teens have different styles and preferences, be on the lookout for any clothing that is out of the norm for your child.


For instance, your teen may try to hide the signs of abuse (e.g. scratches, burns, bruises, bite marks, broken bones, etc.) by wearing long sleeves or pants. They might keep a hoodie on even when indoors. Beware of any strange changes in their attire that aren’t appropriate for the weather or setting.You may also notice that a teen who once took pride in their appearance stops grooming themselves or putting any effort into what they wear or how they look. This may be caused by depression, or the trauma of abuse.;
, Has your teen had multiple bruises recently? Unexplained wounds, bruises, or broken bones could be a sign of physical abuse. Also, be suspicious when your teen’s explanation doesn’t align with the injury, or if they refuse to give an explanation at all.Let’s say your teenage daughter comes home from a date with a huge bruise on her shoulder. You ask about it and she replies, “Oh, I bumped into the roof of the car when I was getting out,” then averts her eyes. This could be an indication that she is ashamed of the bruise and trying to cover up abuse.
 Are you a co-parent or relative who is suspicious of the detached relationship your teen has with other caregivers? Being reluctant to be in a room with the caregiver or seeming very cautious or “on guard” in their presence could be a warning sign of abuse. A teen who is physically abused may also fear going home.They may also show a general fear or anxiety in regards to any social interaction, not just when around their caregiver or possible abuser.
 Another common indicator of physical abuse is your teen shrinking back or flinching after sudden movements. This jumpy behavior may have developed because they fear being struck.

 One of the main causes of nausea is simply having an illness. A flu bug, stomach ailment, or other illnesses can be a major cause of nausea.

This may be a good time to check for a fever. While not every illness causes elevated fever, it can help narrow down why the nausea is happening.
Was it something you ate that turned bad? Food poisoning is surprisingly common. Check with other members of your household--if all of your roommates have stomachaches after eating dinner last night, it may be due to food poisoning.
If you keep having issues more than a couple of days, it is possible that you may have a gastro-intestinal issue that goes beyond a "stomach bug". There are a lot of medical reasons nausea happens, from simple to severe. A trip to your general practitioner may be in order. Severe and prolonged nausea may even be a reason to go to the ER (as discussed more in-depth below.)

, If you have frequent bouts of nausea, keep a journal for a couple weeks to see if you can find a pattern that points to the culprit. If you suspect food intolerance or other reactions, avoid or limit the food and talk to your doctor.

Lactose intolerance is a common cause of nausea. The ability to digest milk comfortably as an adult is mostly limited to people of European descent, and even then many are lactose-intolerant. Use over-the-counter medications like Lactaid or Dairy Ease to help you digest dairy items, or stick with milk products in which are processed by enzymes, such as yogurt and cheese.
Food sensitivities or even allergies can be another issue. If you notice that you feel queasy shortly after eating strawberries or foods with strawberry, this may be an indicator of this problem.
Food sensitivity and intolerance can only be definitively diagnosed by a qualified medical specialist.
It has become trendy in some regions for people to self-identify as "gluten intolerant" and the like without any sort of medical testing. Be careful of such fads. There are some people who react horribly to gluten. But sometimes the "cure" is due to a placebo effect or simply a person feeling better after a period of time, and ascribing the "cure" to the diet change when in fact it is unclear that it was the diet change, or the fact the body simply healed.
 Before introducing more drugs into your system to treat the nausea, you should first make sure that the source itself isn’t one of the medications you’re already on. Many drugs, like codeine or hydrocodone, can cause nausea and vomiting.If you suffer from ongoing nausea, talk to your doctor about whether any of your medications list it as a side effect. He or she may be able to suggest an alternate medication or a lower dosage.

Avoid smoking.

Scopolamine is a medication available by prescription for severe cases.
Some people get relief from ginger and ginger products. Ginger ale (with natural flavoring), ginger root, or ginger candy can all be helpful.
Avoid traveling on a very full or empty stomach.

Do not drink water quickly. Take a few sips at a time, or suck on ice chips so you do not trigger a throwing up response and make things worse.
Liquids should ideally not be ice-cold; cool or lukewarm is best. Especially if you are overheated, drinking very cold liquids can cause the stomach to cramp up and throw up.

 Click the "Add Photo/Video" button or tap "Add Photo" to take or select a photo to upload. You can add multiple photos to a single post.
 On the desktop site, this will say the current privacy setting. On the mobile site and app, it will just have the current setting's icon.
 This will make the post private so that only you have access to it. Make sure that no one is tagged in the photo, or they'll be able to access it as well.

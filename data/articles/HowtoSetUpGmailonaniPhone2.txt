 It's a blue app that contains a white "A" inside a circle.
 Then tap the "Search" field at the top of the screen and begin typing "Gmail". As you type, apps will be suggested on the screen below the "Search" field.
 Both Gmail and Inbox by Gmail are official Google apps that allow you to send and receive Gmail messages on your iPhone.


The main difference between the two apps is that you can set up non-Gmail accounts in the Inbox app.
 It appears to the right of the app.


When the button label changes to INSTALL, tap it again. An app icon has been added to your home screen.
 It's in the location where the GET and INSTALL buttons had been.
 Doing so permits the app to send you notifications when you receive email.


If you are using the Inbox app instead of the Gmail app, it will ask you to sign in first before it asks you to allow notifications.
You can change these settings by opening your Settings, scrolling down and tapping Notifications, then tapping Gmail or Inbox.
 It's at the bottom of the screen.
 If you see it in the "Accounts" list, slide your account to the "On" (blue) position.


If your account isn't listed, tap + Add account at the bottom of the list. Then enter your Gmail address, tap NEXT, enter your password, and then tap NEXT.
If you've enabled two-step verification for Gmail, enter the verification code you received via text or using Authenticator.
 It's in the upper-left corner of the screen. Now you've set up your Gmail account on your iPhone using one of the official Google apps.


To add or edit your Gmail accounts, tap ≡ in the upper-left corner of the Inbox, tap the downward arrow to the right of your Gmail address, then tap ⚙️ Manage accounts.

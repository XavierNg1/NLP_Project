 Rise them in cool water and pat dry with a paper towel. Use a knife to score the skin in a cross-hatch pattern on both sides.


The cross-hatching will help the skin get crispy. Avoid cutting into the meat.
 Set them on a plate and allow them to come to room temperature.
 Use the blunt side of a knife to scrape off the moisture that has emerged from the salted breasts. Excess moisture will prevent the skin from getting crispy.
 Lay the duck breasts in the pan with the skin sides down. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, depending on the size of the breasts.
 Cook for an additional 3-5 minutes.


After you flip the breasts, salt the now-exposed skin. This will help the skin get even crispier and more flavorful.
 Lean the breasts against each other so the edges can cook for about a minute on each side.
 Place them on a cutting board and allow them to rest for 5 minutes before slicing to serve.

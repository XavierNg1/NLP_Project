 Lightly touch her arm, shoulder, or hand as you speak - just a second or two will start to get your message across. Touch her gently when she says something you agree with or says something funny., Face her with your entire body and lean in to listen closer if she speaks softly. This will get her comfortable with less physical distance between the two of you. However, if she pulls away, pull away as well so as not to seem intimidating.


Refrain from crossing your arms. If sheâ€™s paying close attention to your movements, she could mistake this as you showing a lack of interest.
 Do this for just a few seconds, just enough that she catches you looking and looks away. Eye contact is a powerful tool to make her intrigued by you. At first you may just exchange quick glances, but over time you can extend the length of your eye contact if she reciprocates.

 The sight and sound of these natural enemies will cause cats to give your property a wide berth.
 It's a well-known fact that cats and water do not mix, so felines will happily stay out of the water's range and off of your lawn. An added bonus is that your grass and flowers will get a nice watering in the process.
 The cats will be bothered by their spicy paws at grooming time, and, with habitual application, will learn that your property is the culprit. You can temporarily keep them from spending time in a certain area by sprinkling plenty of pepper around.


Sprinkle pepper under your porch, in your shed, on your back patio, or wherever you see cats playing or napping.
Pepper works on grass, too, but you will have to reapply it frequently, especially after heavy rains.

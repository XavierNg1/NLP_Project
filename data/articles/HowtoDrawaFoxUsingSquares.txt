 Some animals may not be appropriate for this sort of shape and you may need to consider using circles.;
, This often works best if you use a natural pose, but you can also draw the animal in a more human-like position.
 For example, if you are drawing a mouse, draw a considerably small head. However if you are drawing an elephant, use a large head. For a fox, use a medium sized head.
 This may, again, depend on the animal. For a fox, draw a fairly long rectangle that sits behind the head.
 This includes the eyes, ears, nose and mouth. For a fox, draw an elongated snout with an oval shaped nose, almond shaped eyes and pointy ears. The mouth may be sly or neutral, depending on the character that you are drawing. For example, if the fox is destined to be cunning, use a sly smile.
, For a fox, draw bushy cheeks, fluffy ears and a strip of white down the centre of the head.
 This may include fur and markings. When drawing a fox, add a fluffy, white underbelly.
 You may choose to leave it simple or you may choose to add in shading. If you decide to do this, decide on a point from which light may shine and use darker shading the further away from that point you get. To keep it simple, use a limited colour pallet and colour each part in the same colour.

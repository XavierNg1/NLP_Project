 Russian Blues are fairly timid and can take a while to adjust to new people, places, and pets. They like routine, and anything out of the ordinary can cause them stress. When you first get a Russian Blue, you should slowly introduce it to your family members and home environment. For example, try confining the cat to one room for a few days, until they are completely comfortable with you and have adjusted to the environment.If you have another pet, you should keep them separated in the beginning until they have had a chance to learn each others scents in a non-threatening manner.
When you have guests over, your Russian Blue is likely to hide initially. Your cat may venture out for a visit once they have deemed the guests safe and non-threatening., The Russian Blue is a sensitive cat and doesnâ€™t like to be ignored. A lack of attention can cause your cat to become anxious and fearful, so it is important that you spend time petting and playing with your cat on a daily basis.Despite their love of attention, the Russian Blue can also play alone and entertain itself for hours while you are at work.
 Russian Blues love to play and are especially fond of retrieving. Some of them will even play catch with you if you toss them a small colorful ball. Make sure that your cat has a variety of toys, such as feather-like toys or toys that mimic mice or birds, to swat and chase., In order to avoid having your cat scratch the furniture, you should have multiple scratch posts situated throughout the house. You could, for instance, have a post in your bedroom and one in the living room. Keeping their nails short will also diminish any damage that comes as a result of scratching.

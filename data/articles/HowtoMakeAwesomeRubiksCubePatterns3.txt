 Once again, you want to start off with your Rubik’s cube in its solved position. Making a fish pattern on your Rubik’s cube is simple. The end result will have swapped two edge pieces so that the remaining ones look like a fish with fins. If you hold the cube diagonally it will look like a fish swimming away from you., Start with the white surface facing you. Then, turn the front face of the cube by 180 degrees (two clicks). Now, take the right side and twist it 180 degrees as well., Keep the white cube in front of you and again twist the front of it 180 degrees. Turn the right side, then the front face, and the right side one more time. Always keep the white face in front of you by making sure the center cube of the face is white.
 When you are finished, you should see a fish shape that looks as though it is swimming away. The four center pieces are its body and the three remaining are the fins.

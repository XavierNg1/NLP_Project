 Take the time to buy a nice card in which to enclose your letter.

You can be more informal if your teacher will find it appropriate. For example, if you call your teacher "Coach Sue," then call her "Coach Sue" in the salutation.
Avoid calling your teacher by his or her first name unless you are truly on a first-name basis. Make sure that you show the appropriate level of respect.
Avoid starting out with "Hey" or "Hi." This is a letter to your teacher, not to your Facebook friend.



If you haven't spoken to this teacher in a long time, then take some time to remind your teacher who you are. Teachers have so many students that they may not remember names initially, but they will remember unique things that you have done or unique personal characteristics.
If you are just transitioning out of this teacher's class, then you can simply start your note without any extra introduction.
 Don't say, "You were a great teacher. I liked your class." Instead, say something like, "You had a simple way of helping me understand a really difficult subject" or "Your influence helped me to become more confident."

, Teachers need to know how their specific actions and unique personalities make a difference for their students.
, Typing the letter will make it appear too distant and formal.

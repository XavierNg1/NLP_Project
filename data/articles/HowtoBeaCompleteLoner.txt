 Delete your accounts on social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc.).;
, When possible, sit at an empty table.
 You must always have something to do in order to avoid a conversation. It's best you have an iPod, marbles, playing cards or a gaming system.
 No clubs, school student groups, house parties, anything. Remember to be truly alone you must isolate yourself from any social contact.
 Wear all dark colors (black, gray, brown.) Having a dull appearance keeps people from approaching you. Dye your hair a dark color and style it to cover your face. This also steers people away from making conversation with you.
 Keep your head down and pretend not to hear those around you.
 Don't have interest in anyone. Say little to no words when they approach you.

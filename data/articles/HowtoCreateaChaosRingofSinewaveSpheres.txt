 Name them Data, Chart and Saves. If you have completed the Article and workbook How to Acquire a Ring of Sinewave Spheres, we'll be using that article for our model and quite a bit of time can be saved by looking for MODIFIED or NEW sections after doing a SAVE AS of the first workbook under a name appropriate to the present project. The workbook being used for this article is titled Chaos Sinewave On Sphere NO X.xlsx Otherwise, simply follow the steps in order. #* As a warning note that this process uses the RandBetween function with over 34,0000 cells involved and can take large amounts of processing time. Please set the Calculation setting to Manual and carefully follow the instructions to PASTE VALUES as given.

Adj Cos: Edit Go To cell range A6:A17285 and enter into A6 w/o quotes the following formula, "=17*COS((ROW()-6)*0.25/12*PI()/180)" and Edit Fill Down. The .25 is for 1440*.25 = 360. 17280/12=1440. So we are taking 1/12th of 1/4 or 1/48th of 17280 = 360, the degrees of the trig function cosine for a circle. PI()/180 converts radians to degrees. (ROW()-6) in row 6 = 0, so we start off taking the cosine of 0, which is 1, and multiplying it by 17. 17 is twice the Stretch factor, and if I recall rightly, is 1/2 the radius of the ring (the Stretch factor operates from each sphere's center). However, Shrinker is also involved, as you'll see later.
Adj Sin: Edit Go To cell range B6:B17285 and enter into B6 w/o quotes the following formula,"=17*SIN((ROW()-6)*0.25/12*PI()/180)+17"and Edit Fill Down, which is different than the above one for cosine by the addition of 17 to it. All in all, that give us 4*8.5, and that is the radius, as I recall.
Indicator: Select cell C6 and enter 1. Edit Go To cell range C7:C17286 and enter w/o quote the formula, "=IF((ROW()-7)/MAGIC=INT((ROW()-7)/MAGIC),1,IF((ROW()-7)=0,1,0))" and Edit Fill Down. This formula says, 'Take a look at the row I'm in, divide it by the number of rows per sphere (MAGIC) and if that number is an integer, return a 1, otherwise if I'm in the next-to-top row also return a 1, otherwise, return a 0.' So now there is an indicator of where 1 sphere ends and the next one begins, no matter how many spheres the user selects to chart.
MODIFIED: Randy: Edit Go To cell range D6:D17286 and enter into D6 w/o quotes the following formula,"=RANDBETWEEN(4,7)/100" and Edit Fill Down. Warning: Make calculation Manual before adding this variable or column into your formulas, especially as a factor, as it can take 20 minutes to calculate and draw the new chart. It is not currently employed, but a copy of its formula has been saved at the bottom of the x and y formulas. Edit Go To cell range D6:D17285 and Insert Name Define Name Randy to cell range $D$6:$D$17285. Also, Edit Go To cell range D6:D17286 and Copy, then Paste Values right back to cell D6:D17286.
t: 0 to nπ: Select cell E6 and enter 0. Select cell E7 and enter the formula "=(2*PI()/MAGIC)". Edit Go To cell range E8:E17285 and enter w/o quotes into E8 the formula "=IF(C8=1,2*PI(),2*PI()/MAGIC+E7)" and Edit Fill Down.
z1_: Edit Go To cell range F6:F17285 and enter w/o quotes into F6 the formula "=CEE*COS(AYE*E6)" and Edit Fill Down. Edit Go To cell range F6:F17285 and Insert Name Define Name z1_ to cell range $F$6:$F$17285.
Adj_x1: Edit Go To cell range G6:G17285 and enter w/o quotes into G6 the formula "=IF(C6=1,A6,G5)" and Edit Fill Down. Edit Go To cell range G6:G17285 and Insert Name Define Name Adj_x1 to cell range $G$6:$G$17285. This makes a constant adjustment as if one were referencing a new center of every new sphere from Adj Cos, else it takes the value just above itself.
Adj_y1: Edit Go To cell range H6:H17285 and enter w/o quotes into H6 the formula "=IF(C6=1,B6,H5)" and Edit Fill Down. Edit Go To cell range H6:H17285 and Insert Name Define Name Adj_y1 to cell range $H$6:$H$17285. This makes a constant adjustment as if one were referencing a new center of every new sphere from Adj Sin, else it takes the value just above itself.
x: No z: Edit Go To cell range I6:I17285 and enter w/o quotes into I6 the formula "=SHRINKER^2*(Stretch_x1*(((BEE^2-CEE^2*COS(AYE*E6)*COS(AYE*E6))^0.5 *COS(E6)))+Adj_x1)" and Edit Fill Down. This is the x part of the heart of the sinewave sphere formula from the text, without the z dimension added or multiplied in, which is why it took me so long to discover how to make it work.
y: With z: Edit Go To cell range J6:J17285 and enter w/o quotes into J6 the formula "=SHRINKER^2*(Stretch_y1*(((BEE^2-CEE^2*COS(AYE*E6)*COS(AYE*E6))^0.5* SIN(E6))+z1_)+Adj_y1)" and Edit Fill Down. This is the y part of the heart of the sinewave sphere formula from the text, with the z dimension added in, which is why it took me so long to discover how to make it work. In the spirallic spheroids Garthwaite Curve, the z-dimension is multiplied into both x and y parts. Furthermore, there was no adjustment for the GOLDEN MEAN Long Leg, which was expected all along, until it worked without it. The other curve doesn't.
Select cell I17286 and enter the formula w/o quotes "=I6" and select cell J17286 and enter the formula w/o quotes "=J6". This makes the top connecting line from the last sphere to the first.

NEW: COPY CELL RANGE A11:J17285 and then PASTE SPECIAL VALUES right back atop the same cell range. Format Fill Red and Font White. This means that the top Variables section is no longer operative in any useful way until you Edit Fill Down the formulas from row 10, which may mean having to wait a considerable length of time, as in 25 - 40 minutes. It can also take that long to save the workbook, so ...

NEW: y2: With z: Edit Go To cell range M6:M17285 and enter w/o quotes into M6 the formula "=SHRINKER^2*(Stretch_y1*(((BEE^2-CEE^2*COS(AYE*E6)*COS(AYE*E6))^0.5* SIN(E6))+z1_)+Adj_y1*0.5)+Adj_y2" and Edit Fill Down.

Hopefully, that avoided all the waiting and waiting for processing time to pass. We'll see.

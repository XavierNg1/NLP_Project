 McCree carries a six-shot revolver, and it can do a lot of damage at close and mid-range. Align your enemies in the reticle, and fire repeatedly with the right trigger.;
, Up close, you may not be able to rely on taking potshots at the enemy and ducking for cover. When up close and personal, hold down the left trigger to unload your pistol into the enemy with extreme speed.
 McCree is most useful at mid-range. He can place a few bullets in the enemy, and dodge their retaliation before trying again.
Â McCree can use a simple Solid Snake-like roll to dodge fire and make escapes. Move the left analog stick in the direction you want to move and press the left bumper.
 Unlike the Man With No Name, McCree has access to modern military equipment, including flashbang grenades. Throw them at your enemies with the right bumper to temporarily stun them.
 After dealing a certain amount of damage, you will unlock your special ability. Press "Y/Triangle" to activate Deadeye. This will allow McCree to rapidly draw on all enemies in his line of sight. He will then mercilessly fire into his enemies with extreme precision.

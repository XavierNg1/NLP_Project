, Usually the instructions tell you things to do to help the candles burn longer like: when to trim wicks, what other maintenance to do etc.
 By not doing this you can dampen or dry out the wax, you can also damage the candle.
 Do not use a scented candle the way you would use a 24 hour candle. They are different candles and the scented candle may be used all up after you abuse it like that.

 Use a comb to do this. By lifting the hair away from the skin, it will be easier to see where the fur stops and the skin begins. This way, you may reduce the risk of accidentally cutting or nipping your cat’s skin., While the hair is lifted with the comb, take a pair of scissors and cut the edges of the mat. To be safe, only cut the edges of the mat on the outside of the comb, i.e., the part of the mat that is farthest from your cat’s skin. Cutting the edges of the mat will loosen the mat, making it easier to detangle with your fingers or a comb.Never lie the scissors flat onto your cat’s fur and skin. By doing this, you may risk cutting your cat’s skin. Always use a comb to lift the mat away from your cat’s skin before cutting the edges of the mat.
 You can also use a wide-toothed comb or a mat comb to untangle the rest of the mat. If the mat will not come loose, then use the comb and scissors again to cut the edges of the mat. Resume untangling the mat with your fingers or a comb., In general, mats that are smaller than the tip of your thumb can be easily removed at home without professional help. However, if the mat is very large, tight, or close to your cat’s skin, then you may want to take your cat to a professional groomer to have it removed.Additionally, if your cat’s coat is covered in mats, then you should take it to a professional groomer or your veterinarian to have them removed. In severe cases, the professional may need to shave your cat.

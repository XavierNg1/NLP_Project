 Mesa biomes look like deserts with red, often striped hills or spires. These biomes have the special features described below, only in Minecraft Pocket Edition.
 Gold can appear at any elevation in mesa biomes. This makes them the easiest and safest way to find gold in Pocket Edition. Dig branches into the hillsides, or just walk along and scan the cliffs for gold ore.
 Mesa biomes also have the only above-ground abandoned mine shafts. These features have minecarts with chests inside them, and about one in four chests contain gold.Beware of spiders as you search.

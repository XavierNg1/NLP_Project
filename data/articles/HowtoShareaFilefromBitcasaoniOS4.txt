 Locate the Bitcasa app on your iOS device. It’s the app with a green background with a house on a cloud drawing. Tap on it to launch it.
 If you’re already logged in, you may skip this step. Otherwise, you will be asked to enter your Bitcasa email address and password in order to proceed. Do so on the fields provided and tap the login button.
 Bitcasa’s main screen gives you easy access to major categories of your files. Aside from the main file directory under My Drive, you can also quickly access Photos, Videos, Music, Documents, and your Favorites.
 My Drive contains your main file directory. Tap on it to get inside to view your files and folders.
 Find the folder where the files you want to share are located. Tap on the folders to open them.
 You can share one or several files at once using a share link from Bitcasa. Tap the share icon from the bottom toolbar. It’s the icon with a box and an arrow pointing outward.


The files inside the folder will all have circles in front of them. Tap on the circles of the files you’d like to share to select them.
 After your selection, tap the Share link found on the bottom toolbar. A submenu of sharing options will be shown. Tap on the “Send Text Message” button.


A text message window will appear that already contains the share link for the files selected.
 Input the phone numbers of all the recipients in the To field. Type in your text message underneath it.
 Once you’re done, tap the “Send” button as you normally will when sending regular texts. The text message containing the share link will be sent to your recipients.


This method will only work on iPhones and iPads with mobile carrier accounts since the share link will be sent via text messages, which will need a mobile carrier service provider.

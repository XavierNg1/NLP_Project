 Put the Pipe Roller parallel to the board.;
, Tighten it using your fingers.
 This is also called the SUP (Stand Up Paddle-board) style. It is the easiest style to learn. Place your feet on the board in line with the pipe and board. Bend your knees for more of a challenge. Wheelies, hang ten, and other moves are possible, and you can get a skiing sensation when transferring weight across the roller. Balance requirements are very similar to stand up paddle boarding.
 Step onto the Holoholo board as if it were a skateboard; the board will have a slight roll and lots of tilt to challenge your balance. Once you are comfortable with the board touching the ground on both sides, you can try to stay balanced in the small amount of travel or roll that is allowed by the Pipe-Lock and stops. There is a fine line you can feel when you are centered over the pipe roller and maintaining control. That same sensation is common to most board sports. Once you have your balance, try kick turns, 360's and all kinds of skate tricks. Practice rail grabs and other surfing, snowboarding, and wake board positions.
 Sometimes the board is restricted from stops if you do the kanoa ride.

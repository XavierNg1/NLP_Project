 Remember that you are the person setting the professional tone for your conversation. Take a deep breath or count to ten in your head if you need to calm down. Stick to the issues at hand and try not to veer off subject. Remind yourself that you are trying to help them, but you also need to do your job.
 The employee may respond negatively to your comments and may react by lashing out. If this happens, it is best if you both step back for a bit. Ask the employee to leave for the day and state that you will resume the conversation tomorrow with HR present as well. You must maintain a degree of authority here or you will lose the ability to guide this employee’s behavior and ensure the company’s productivity.This is another reason why you want to have this conversation sooner rather than later. If you wait too long before talking with them, they may feel as if you should’ve warned them earlier.
 If you feel that the conversation may go badly, it is probably a smart idea to invite a member of HR or another supervisor to sit in on the talk. They can help to reinforce what you say about the rules. An employee will also be less likely to get agitated when faced with two calm people., If the employee is uncomfortable talking with you about their situation, you might want to allow them to write an official letter stating the reasons for their actions and their desire to improve in the future. Request that they explicitly agree to specific measures of improvement in the future.


This letter should also be placed with an employee’s official file with HR.
 If the employee seems unwilling to change or refuses to talk civilly with you, it may be necessary to put them into contact with your supervisor or HR directly. Give the other party a heads up if you do this, so that they’ll know what to expect.

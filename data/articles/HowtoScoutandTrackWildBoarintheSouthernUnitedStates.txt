Arm yourself with a weapon capable of lethal force before scouting for signs of activity.

Look for a mud hole near a creek bed called a hog wallow. Near the wallow you should see a hog rub at the base of small trees that will appear scratched and caked in mud.



Look for signs of hogs digging up roots and digging into rotting tree trunks. Be cautious if you find any tell-tale signs of activity like hog wallows, hog rubs, or hog rooting.



Look for specific hog shaped prints while tracking. A hog track resembles a deer-sized track except it lacks pointed grooves, and it has larger rounded front tracks without dewclaw prints.



Look for the highway trail that is used the most in the area. A highway trail may be several miles long with minor trails branching off. This is the best area to scout from.



Do not confuse hog scat for deer droppings; the pellets of hog scat are three times larger with remnants of hair and bone.



Home for the hog is a “hot spot” called a hog bed, which is nothing more than a bowl shaped hole in the ground used to hide and rest in. The hog bed is called a hot spot because they are hard to spot, making it easier to stumble on a sleeping hog. Be cautious! If you accidentally disturb a sleeping hog be prepared for an unprovoked attack.
 Choose to either:


Scout the area from a camouflaged hide until you make a positive identification of the hog;
Plan a way to safely ambush the hog by engaging from a far away distance.
(Optional) Arrange to have the hog captured and relocated by Wildlife Services.

 In rare cases, you can pop an extremely sore blister on your own. You should only do this if the pain becomes debilitating. Before popping a blister, wash your hands thoroughly with antibacterial soap and water. You should never touch a blister with dirty hands., Before popping your blister, clean the area around it with water. Using alcohol, hydrogen peroxide or iodine can slow healing., You will use a sewing needle to pop the blister, but this should be sterilized first to prevent infection. Wipe the needle down with rubbing alcohol, which you can purchase at a local drugstore.You can dab rubbing alcohol from a bottle onto a cotton swab or use rubbing alcohol pads.


Alternatively you can sterilize the needle by running it through an open flame until it turns red. Use something to grasp the needle when you do this like Kelly clamps, since the needle will become very hot.
 Take the needle and gently insert it into the blister. Puncture it several times, near the edge of the blister. Allow the fluid to drain out naturally while you leave the skin covering the blister in place., Once you've drained the blister, apply an ointment to it. You can use Vaseline or Plastibase, both of which can be purchased at a drugstore. Use a clean cotton swab to rub the ointment over the blister.Some ointments may irritate a blister. If you notice any signs of a rash, cease use of your ointment.
 Place a piece of gauze or a bandage over the blister. This will protect it from infection while it heals. Change the dressing twice a day and, when you change it, add new ointment.Remember to wash your hands before touching your blister.

 Violence should always be a last resort. If you aren’t capable of winning a fight you might end up getting hurt much worse if you try to fight back. , Some bullies will see this as a form of weakness, but it’s something that you have to do. If you can stop the bullying and future confrontations, you should.


Try saying something like, “listen, I’ve got nothing against you. I’m not sure why you have something against me, but lets just let it lie. Thank you.”

, If the bullying only includes words, don’t escalate the situation. Just walk away silently. Don’t even acknowledge the situation. Don’t act scared, just never even make eye contact with the bully. Act as if they did not exist. If they can’t torture you, they probably will lose interest.


When they try to interact with you try to keep a completely blank look on your face and continue whatever you were doing. This will really frustrate them, and you’ll be putting yourself in a powerful position.
 Most people don’t like bullies. If you are in a public place and the kid is bullying you, don’t be afraid to call them out calmly and firmly. Tell them that picking on other people isn't cool, and you're not sure why they do it. Hopefully others will agree with you and let the bully know too.

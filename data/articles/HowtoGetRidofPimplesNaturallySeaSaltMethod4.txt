 Sea salt can be used for exfoliating the skin, or removing dead skin cells. This will allow new skin underneath to grow more easily and regenerate. You'll need a good quality, fine-grained sea salt, moisturizing oil, and essential oil.Use 1 cup of sea salt. You can find sea salt at specialty markets, health food stores and other locations. Don't use table salt, which is coarse and may be too rough for your skin.
Add 1/2 cup of moisturizing oil. Coconut, grapeseed, jojoba or almond oil works well. Coconut oil has the advantage of being antibacterial, killing the acne bacteria of pimples. Its medium chain fatty acids also help dissolve the comedone plug and open the skin pores.Add 5-15 drops of essential oil. Essential oil can offer a calming or invigorating scent to your salt scrub. Choose calming scents such as lavender or mint for calming, or citrus for invigorating.
Mix the ingredients together in a small bowl.
 Scoop up some of the salt scrub and use your fingertips to work it into your skin. Use a gentle, circular motion.
 Make sure you rinse all of the salt scrub from your face. Excess residue may cause irritation or dryness on your skin if you leave it on.
 Gently dab at your face with a clean towel to dry your skin.
 If you have acne on your back, chest or arms, you can also use this salt scrub to exfoliate your skin in these areas. Follow the same procedure as using this salt scrub on your face.

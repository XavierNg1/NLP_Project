 Fill a large saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water. Place a heat safe bowl (preferably glass) on top of the saucepan. Make sure that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the surface of the water.
 You will be placing the finishing macaroons on this, and using it to transfer them to the fridge.
 You can use semi-sweet chocolate chips, but it would be better if you used chopped, high-quality chocolate, however., Keep stirring until the chocolate is melted and smooth. There should be no lumps, chunks, or clumps. Don't let the chocolate burn.
 Let any excess chocolate drip off before placing the macaroon onto the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining macaroons.
 If you have lots of leftover chocolate, you can scoop it up with a spoon, and drizzle it over the macaroons for nice touch., This will allow the chocolate to harden and set.

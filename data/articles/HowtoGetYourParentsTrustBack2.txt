 Spending more time with your family benefits your trust relationship in several ways. First, your parents won’t be suspicious about how you’re spending your time if it is with them. Second, spending time with people helps you understand and communicate with them better, which can help your relationship. Third, your parents will be reminded of your great qualities, like your sense of humor, instead of focusing only on the trust violation.
 Do your chores. Pick your brother up from school on time. Offer to help with the dishes after dinner. Showing responsibility for everyday things can help your parents think of you as a responsible person. This alone may not be enough to rebuild trust, but combined with other things like open communication, these small steps can help.
 Demonstrating to your parents that you care about them, yourself, and your relationship is an important element of your two-way trust relationship. Showing that you care may take on many different forms, but doing and saying things that you know will make the other person feel good is a place to start.
 If you have hurt anyone aside from your parents as part of the trust violation, apologize and try to make it right. If you asked your parents what you could do to regain their trust, do what they said to do, even if it seems silly. Even if it seems like, for example, washing your dad’s car may have nothing to do with regaining his trust, you are showing that you are willing to do what it takes.

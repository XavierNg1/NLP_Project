 Let the pints of ice cream sit out on the counter for a few minutes. When they become soft enough to handle, use a spoon to scoop the ice cream into a large bowl. Stir the ice cream with the spoon until it has the consistency of spreadable icing, but isn't too runny.
 While the ice cream is softening, remove the cake halves from the freezer. Unwrap one half and place it on a cake plate. Set the other half aside for now.
 Spread a pint of ice cream over the first cake half using a spoon and an offset spatula or knife. Try not to let it spill over the edges of the cake. You should have a thick, solid layer of ice cream. Place the second layer of cake on the layer of ice cream. Spread the second pint of ice cream on top of the cake.








For a smaller cake, you can leave off the second ice cream layer.
If you'd prefer to have the cake layer on top, you can still have two ice cream layers; after spreading the first ice cream layer, make a layer of crushed cookies or chocolate chips, then spread the second pint of ice cream on top of that before adding the second cake layer.
 Place the cake in the freezer until it is completely frozen, which will take about two to four hours.

 Turn your clocks over or put them in a closet or drawer where you can’t see them. Set each clock for a slightly different time. When you check the time, you’ll have to remember how you adjusted this clock. This will help you redirect your thinking away from the passage of time. The same is true for electronic devices like cell phones and computers. If you want to use your cell phone or computer, switch the time zone. Just don't forget to change it back. The less you think about the time, the sooner it will pass., Visit friends. Go to the movie, or do something as simple as taking a walk or drive. Sitting at home will increase the temptation for you to watch the clock all day. Instead, go out, even if you only go out do something like returning an overdue library book or stopping by the ATM., Invite your loved ones over or go to them. Play board games, talk, go out to eat. Whatever you do to pass time, it’s often easier to get your mind off of waiting when you have other people there to talk to and interact with., Exercise releases endorphins that help you feel happier and more relaxed. You don’t necessarily need a gym membership, but it may help to at least leave your house to exercise. Meet some friends to play basketball, go for a run, or take a bike ride.

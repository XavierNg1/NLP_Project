 Find a concealer that is one to two shades lighter than the skin on your face. Most makeup brands carry concealers designed specifically to cover under-eye circles. Choose a concealer that is moist enough and that won’t settle into any fine lines around the eyes., Most dark circles take on a bluish or purplish tinge, so counteract that color with a concealer with a yellow tone to it.
 Only apply where the circles are: normally a half-circle shape that extends downward from the inside of the eye downwards towards the cheek. Gently dab concealer in this area with the tip of your finger or a soft makeup brush. Blend it in with the tip of your finger or a damp sponge.
 Translucent powder is a finishing makeup that you can brush over your skin to set your concealer, foundation and other makeup. Using a wedge sponge, dab some translucent powder under your eyes and blend it in.
 Dark eyeliner will detract from the dark circles by making your eyes look more sparkling and vivid. Line your upper and lower lids with dark brown eye pencil. Add a layer of dark blue eyeliner on outer third of the upper lid.
 Using waterproof mascara will ensure that you don’t get smudges of mascara below your eyes, which could contribute to having darker circles. Use a dark mascara on your upper lashes, applying two coats.
 Highlighter pens add glow to your skin and can perk up your look. They can be applied to the under-eye area to minimize dark circles. To apply, brush the pen over your skin with light feathery strokes. Blend in the makeup with the tip of your finger.

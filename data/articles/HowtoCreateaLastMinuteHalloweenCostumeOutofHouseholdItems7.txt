 You'll want:


A red top and red leggings/red tight slacks or a red dress
Hair band or a head band (optional)
Cardboard horns (optional)
A broom handle (optional)
Cardboard tines or sticks (optional)

, Make these by cutting out two narrow horn-shaped (tall triangle) pieces (about 3 inches (7.5 cm) long) from a piece of cardboard. It doesn't need to be too detailed. Keep an extra bit of cardboard towards the bottom so that you can glue or staple it to the hair-/head-band, in such a way that they will extend upward.


When your whole horn piece is complete, paint it red or cover it in red paper or fabric, if you have the time and supplies.
 It should be an "E" shaped fork. Make this by cellophane taping/tying string around the cardboard tines/sticks so that they are secured onto the broom handle.

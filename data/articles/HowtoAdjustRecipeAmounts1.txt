Before shopping for the ingredients, read through the recipe. Most main dish recipes will double or triple easily, but baking generally doesn't scale well due to the precise ingredient measurements needed to create the chemical reaction required for baking to turn out properly. Determine how many times you'll need to multiple the recipe in order to gain your required serving amount.;

If possible, make your recipe amount conversions in pencil beside the actual recipe. If a recipe calls for 1 cup (240 ml) of flour, then you should write in 2 cups (480 ml) flour. Continue this through the whole list of ingredients and amounts, except for spices. You can round an item up. If the recipe calls for 1 egg and you're multiplying your recipe by 1.5 then you'd end up with 1 1/2 eggs; round this up to 2 eggs.
When doubling a recipe that includes spices and alcohol, only multiple these ingredients by 1.5 or you risk overpowering the recipe with their assertive flavors.



Scaling a recipe up means that you need extra ingredients. This holds true for the main ingredients such as proteins, vegetables and starches. Make a list of the amounts of each ingredient you need after scaling the recipe. Don't worry about buying exact amounts of spices; dried spices will keep quiet well in a kitchen pantry for months.

Prepare the recipe. The directions will remain the same but cooking times may need to be adjusted to allow for a larger batch. Anything prepared for the oven will take additional time. Check frequently to ensure you're not overcooking the recipe.

 "Stay out of the water until you learn to swim." No! That does not work. Get in the water to learn to swim. You have to participate--get to it. Reach the world; "Tagâ€”you're it..."; it's your move... go for the gold!

, For fun, participate in a sports league, andsupport your family join in family activities. Don't sit around watching television, or playing video games excessively.

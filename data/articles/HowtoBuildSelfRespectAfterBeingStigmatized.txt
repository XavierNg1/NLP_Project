 Is this person singling you out because of his or her own insecurities and jealousies? If so, get away from the person, because they will do nothing but try to diminish you.


Understand what's going on. If it's not just one person but a group stigmatizing you over religion, ethnic background, gender, any issues you have no control of, that's a different situation. Prejudice can be resisted but this article is about handling social attacks from one or two disaffected people.;
, Focus instead on your good points, and build on these. It's good to face the truth about yourself in order to make improvements, but this does not have to be done in an abusive and shame-based way.
 Spend a few days letting yourself feel the horrible shame and stigmatizing feelings, don't stuff them, then bring all of it to the light with prayer, meditation, and caring for oneself well with good nutrition, exercise, and writing, and more writing, your feelings, and anything else that needs to come out.
 Go out and do things you like. Beware: if you party and use drugs or drink, these could exacerbate your negative feelings.
 Many times, when a person gets stigmatized by a friend (not a real friend, that is), others who know the person who stigmatized you could pretend to befriend you, then next you know, they are stabbing you in the back with even worse stigmatizing. Exit any places where you know it's not good for you to be. Don't test the waters, just go.
 Try writing with paper and pen (not computer), hitting a pillow for anger, eating nutritionally, and spending time with supportive friends whose presence makes you feel better.

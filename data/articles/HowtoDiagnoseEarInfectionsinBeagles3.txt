 If your dog displays the symptoms of an ear infection, you shouldn’t just give him any ear medication. The ear infection might be due to a bacteria or yeast that the medicine doesn’t help. It’s better to take your dog to the vet to make sure he gets the proper treatment., To help prevent ear infections, clean your dog’s ears regularly. When you give your Beagle a bath, make sure to dry the ears well.Once a week you should check your Beagle’s ears.Lift your dog’s ear flaps every day and inspect them quickly. Look for skin redness, excessive wax, or a discharge from the ear.You should also give each ear a quick sniff to see if there is any unpleasant smell, which could indicate an infection.
Compare one ear with the other. Often ear on one side is worse than the other and can indicate an infection.
 The ear canal is lined with skin, and it tends to be warm and moist, which makes it a great environment in which bacterial or yeast infection can grow. Because a Beagle’s ears are so long, this traps bacteria inside.The Beagle is also an energetic dog that loves to exercise in fields and woods, increasing the risk of grass awns getting into the ear. The Beagle also loves to swim, and if water gets into the ear canal, it makes the environment even more damp, and therefore favourable to infection.
If your Beagle comes into contact with another dog that has ear mites, he might catch the ear mites and develop an ear mite infection.

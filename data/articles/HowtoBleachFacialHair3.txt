 Before using any bleaching products, whether natural or store bought, apply them to a small patch of your skin first. Watch for an allergic reaction over the next day or so. If you have any irritation, you should not use that product to bleach your facial hair.It makes sense to use a patch of skin on a hard to see place on your body, such as your arm.
 If your skin tends to be sensitive, look for mild formulas in the store when finding a bleaching product. Bleaching is a somewhat intense process for any skin type and can cause a lot of irritation if your skin is already sensitive., Bleach can aggravate things like abrasions, warts, and moles. Avoid applying bleach altogether if you have existing warts and moles where your facial hair is. If you have abrasions or injuries, let them clear up before bleaching your skin.

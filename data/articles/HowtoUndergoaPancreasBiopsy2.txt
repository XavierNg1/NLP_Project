 Though most pancreatic biopsies are minimally invasive, you still will go under anesthesia and may have a few wounds. If they use an endoscope, your throat may be tender. Don't expect to work that day after the biopsy.

Instead, you should take it easy at home for the rest of the day. Rest and let yourself physically and emotionally recover from the procedure.
 It generally takes a few days for the biopsy results to come back, but it may take up to two weeks. The sample must be sent to a lab so a pathologist can analyze the samples. This is done under a microscope, where they look for cancer cells.While they examine the cells, they will also stage it, which means they will determine how far the cancer cells have spread. The stage of the cancer helps them determine your treatment.
 Sometimes, pancreatic cancer symptoms can worsen suddenly. If you are waiting for the biopsy results and you start to feel sick, visit your doctor immediately. Do not wait., Most pancreatic biopsies require little to no recovery. You may feel some minor pain or discomfort, so take over-the-counter medication if you feel any pain.If you have a percutaneous FNA, you may experience swelling or soreness at the site.
The incisions used in a laparoscopy generally heal within a week.
 Waiting for the results of a biopsy can be extremely stressful. You may feel scared, hopeless, or anxious, but you should try to stay calm. Trying to predict your results and what that means won't help you. Instead, focus on other things in your life as you wait., If you are having trouble while you wait, you may want to reach out to people who can provide support. Talk to friends or family about how you are feeling, and spend time with them to take your mind off of your results.

You may also choose to go see a therapist. Talking through your emotions may help you prepare for your results and any treatment that might be necessary.

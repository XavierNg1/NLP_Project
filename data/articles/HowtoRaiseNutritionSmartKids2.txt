 Instead, treat all food the same way, while emphasizing some foods should be enjoyed in moderation.For example, don’t refer to ice cream, cakes, or cookies as “treat” foods or use them as rewards. Instead, admit that they are tasty foods that can be enjoyed sometimes in moderation.
 Your kids watch and learn from you. If you are eating donuts, chips, and fast food, they will think these are acceptable eating choices. However, if they see you eating apples, nuts, chicken breasts, and a plate full of vegetables, you will be setting a good example for them to follow.Think about your children every time you make an eating choice. Ask yourself, “What message am I sending to the kids when they see me eating this?”

, To help teach positive eating habits, set a rule where mealtimes are devoted to food. This means your family sits down at the table and focuses on the joy of eating. Leave cell phones and tablets in another room, and don’t eat in front of the television.Eating while distracted can lead to overeating. If you are distracted, you also won’t enjoy the taste of the food and may feel hungry or crave food later.
 Most people eat well throughout the day, until they sit down to watch television at night. People can consume hundreds of calories by munching on chips, cookies, or ice cream while watching a movie or TV show. Set a good example for your children and teach them not to snack out of boredom or habit.Set specific snack times so that your children will not associate TV with snacks. This helps discourage overeating and snacking out of habit.

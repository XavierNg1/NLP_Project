 This can be done on a running track of a known length, such as 100 m (328 ft), or by staking out the distance on an open field.


Use a measuring tape or a meter stick to measure the distance if you’re in a field.
Mark the starting and ending points with a piece of string or a cone.;
, In order to determine the runner’s speed you need to know the amount of time it takes the runner to travel the set distance. Tell the runner to wait until you say “Go!” to get an accurate reading on the stopwatch. Make sure your stopwatch is set to zero, then have the runner get in position at the start of the measured distance.


You can also use a watch to time the runner, but it will be less accurate.
 To sync up the timing as best as possible, yell “Go!” and start the watch at the same time. If you realize that the timing was off, have the runner reset and try again.
 Watch closely to see when the runner crosses the point designated as the finish line. Be sure to stop the watch as close to the exact moment he crosses as possible.
 This division is the calculation to determine the runner’s speed. The equation for speed is distance traveled/time to travel that distance.Using the example length of 100 m (328 ft), if the runner took 10 seconds to run that distance, the runner's speed would be 100 m (328 ft) divided by 10, or 10 m/sec (32.8 feet per second).


Multiplying 10 m/sec by 3,600 (the number of seconds in an hour), the runner traveled 36,000 meters per hour, or 36 kilometers per hour (1 kilometer equals 1,000 m).
Multiplying 32.8 feet per second by 3,600, the runner traveled 118,080 feet per hour, or 22.4 miles per hour (5,280 feet equals 1 mile).

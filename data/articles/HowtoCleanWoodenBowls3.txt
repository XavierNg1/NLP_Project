 Wooden bowls can become dry and may eventually crack, so it is important to treat them with oil sometimes. When you’re looking for oil at the store, make sure it is labeled as food grade. You may also find mineral oil that specifically says it is for cutting boards, butcher blocks, or wooden dishware.You may find mineral oil that is not specifically labelled as food grade. Some of this is safe for consumption and some of it isn’t. If you’re unsure, look for “white mineral oil,” as this is the kind that has been refined enough for consumption.
 Take a clean, dry paper towel and pour a small circle of mineral oil onto it. Wipe the bowl completely, inside and outside, with the mineral oil. Apply the oil in some kind of pattern to make sure you don’t mis any spots.Don’t be afraid of putting too much oil on the bowl. If it seems like the first application soaked into the bowl, put a second, or even third, coat onto it.
Depending on how much you use your bowls. Treat them with mineral oil every couple of months or at least two times a year.
 Set the bowl on a clean spot on the counter or table and leave it overnight. The oil will soak partially into the wood, moisturizing it and coating the surface. If you are in a hurry, try to let the oil sit for at least 30 minutes.Allowing the mineral oil to sit for a short time will still help the bowls last, but not as well as letting the oil soak in for longer.
 After the bowl has sat and soaked in most of the oil, take another dry paper towel and wipe the entire surface of the bowl. There will be some oil that doesn’t soak into the wood, and it is best to remove this excess. Discard the paper towel afterward.


Put them back in the cabinet for later use, or go ahead and use them now. The purpose of using food grade oil is that it’s safe for consumption.

 Make sure you bring plenty of onesies and pants, one pair of pants for every two days you'll be gone, or if you're going for two nights, bring two pairs so that your doll can wear a different pair each day/night. Bring one pair of pajamas; try to bring footed ones, as they tend to be the warmest. Pack two pairs of socks, some shoes if you have them, and booties, hats, and scratch mittens (if needed).
 When you pack diapers, pack two or three for each day, if you like changing your doll's diaper. Remember that you'll need somewhere to keep or throw away the 'dirty' diapers.

Take lots of baby wipes too, not only can you use them for your doll's messes––they can be really helpful around the campsite.
If you have pacifiers or dummies for your doll take two along with some extras, in case you lose some.
 It's quite easy for little items like a doll pacifier or shoe to go missing when you are camping outdoors., If your doll is eating food, take a little plate and spoon., Pack blankets; or, you could use a sleeping bag for your doll if you want to. If you have a small folding doll crib, or a travel cot or carry cot and your parents are happy for you to take it camping with you, your doll can sleep in it bedside you. If not, your doll can just sleep with you in your camp bed or sleeping bag. Make sure you both stay warm!, If you have a doll carrier, like a backpack for dolls, dolly can come on hikes with you.

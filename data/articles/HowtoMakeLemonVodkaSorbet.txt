, Add the vodka, water, sugar and lemon juice into a saucepan and stir continually and steadily bringing the mixture to the boiling point.
 Once the sugar has completely dissolved into the mixture, remove the saucepan from the heat and allow to cool until the mixture reaches room temperature.
,, Once removed, whisk the mixture with an electric whisk in order to break up the ice crystals. Repeat this step 3 times to insure that the finished sorbet will be smooth.

 Lock away harmful liquids and chemicals, such as medicine and cleaning supplies, and make sure your cabinets are secured with childproof locks. Simple push down brackets can be screwed into cabinets and connected to the door to make cabinets nearly impossible for a baby to open but not be too inconvenient for adults.


Other popular locks use magnets to connect cabinet doors and can be disabled when the baby is not around. Visit your local super center or baby supply store for a selection of baby locks.
 Take extra precautions in the kitchen by moving dangerous kitchen utensils, such as knives and heavy dishes, to higher cabinets where they canâ€™t be reached by a mobile toddler.
 Protect against a hot stove and oven by installing stove knob covers that stop children from accidentally turning on the stove. Most models simply pop on to cover the knobs and can be removed for adult use by opening the hinged front.


Oven locks are also simple to install via an adhesive strip that connects the top of the oven to the oven door, making it nearly impossible for a curious child to open the oven door.

 Bottling up emotions can influence other areas of your life drastically. It can lead to aggression toward people you care about, poor performance at work or school, or it can even influence you physically by lowering your immune response, among other things.

If you have a hard time letting out your emotions in front of others, you might benefit from finding a quiet, private space where you can let down your emotional guard.
Keep in mind that there is a difference between allowing yourself to feel your emotions and allowing yourself to be controlled by your emotions. Fixating on your negative thoughts can make you feel even worse and even drive away support you need.Instead, acknowledge your feelings, allow yourself to feel them for a determined period of time, and then try moving forward.;
, When you're in the depths of your misery, the memory of your past love might seem better than it actually was. To maintain perspective and remind yourself that your past love was a human being with human failings, just like everyone else, write a list of your ex's negative traits.
 It may not be possible for you to get the kind of closure you desire. In this case especially, writing a farewell letter to your past love can encourage healing and help you let go of the relationship.

 You may feel anger, jealousy, betrayal, sadness, or any number of other emotions. However, behind every negative emotion is a positive intention.This may be difficult, but explore your feelings, and when you find that positive intention, focus on that instead of the negative.


If the root of your anger is that you feel shame that you allowed someone to hurt you so deeply, you reframe that feeling as: "I was brave enough to love fearlessly. That's a good thing, but I've also learned I need to protect my heart."
If the root of your sadness is that you believe you'll never find a partner again, you can reframe that emotion as: "I was good enough, strong enough, and successful enough to live my life before this relationship, and none of that has changed.", But it's important for you to reach out to someone you trust. This person can offer perspective and support. Some studies show that while you might be uncomfortable making yourself vulnerable in front of someone else, it can strengthen your relationship and make you feel more connected.

 If you and your lost love share a social circle, workplace, or locale, you may need to spend some time avoiding the places your ex frequents. It's important that you don't think of the end of your relationship in terms of a challenge; there is no winning or losing in a relationship.

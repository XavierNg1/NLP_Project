 You need to embrace the age that you are at. If you are eleven, you have a couple more years until you are really in the depths of puberty.There is no need to feel self-conscious that you don’t have leg hair, or that your voice hasn’t dropped. All this will come in time. Honesty is the best way to earn somebody’s respect.
 If you learn that she is only interested in horseback riding, you should not drop all your passions to afford a saddle. Let her determine if your interests are compatible. If you are trying out different activities and unsure what you wish to pursue, keep trying things out. It helps later in life if you begin practicing a hobby young in life like piano, dance, soccer, drawing, or even film making.


Just take a chance if you want to do something.
 As you begin to enter into your adolescent years, friend groups become more important as family life decreases.Try to avoid fighting with your family during this transitional period. Don’t ditch your friends because you don’t think they’re cool anymore. Stay true to who you are and keep your friends in on who you have a crush on.


If they are good friends, they’ll help you figure out ways to get this girl to start to notice you.
If you are in the wrong friend circle, they could ridicule you for your crush and start nasty rumors. Leave hazardous friend circles for the friends that respect and enjoy your company.

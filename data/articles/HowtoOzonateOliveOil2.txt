 When making your ozonated olive oil or purchasing it from a manufacturer, it is important to check the oilâ€™s color. Olive oil that has been properly ozonated will be clear. The final product should be the same opacity as water.If you are making ozonated oil yourself, let the mixture ozonate until it is completely clear. Because various machines take wildly different amounts of time to make ozonated olive oil, be sure to regularly check on the color of your oil.
Avoid buying any ozonated oils that are colored. The manufacturer may have added a dye to the oil, which might irritate your skin, or is hiding the fact that the oil is only partially ozonated.
 Properly ozonated oil should become denser during the process. The finished product should have a gel-like consistency, as opposed to the more liquid state of the original oil. It may also become slightly stickier.Regularly check the viscosity of your oil if you are making it yourself.
If you can, be sure to test the viscosity of commercial oils to ensure that the product is fully ozonated.
 Ozone and ozonated products have a distinct smell that many liken to chlorine. A fully ozonated oil should smell strongly of ozone. If you are unsure about the ozonation state of your oil, try smelling it to see if it smells like ozone.Be careful when inhaling ozone. It can be dangerous for people who suffer from asthma or have lung conditions.
Because some people find the smell off-putting, manufacturers of ozonated olive oil often add a scent to the oil in order to mask the ozone.

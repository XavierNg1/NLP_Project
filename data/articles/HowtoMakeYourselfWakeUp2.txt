 Exercising can make you more alert. It also releases endorphins into your body, which will make you feel good as you wake up.As soon as you wake up, stretch your arms up over your head, towards the top of your bed. Feel your whole body stretch out, and breathe deeply a few times.You can also stretch your legs. Laying on your back, bring one leg up to your chest and hold it. Next, lift that leg straight up in the air in front of you. Switch to the other leg and do the same. Afterwards, you can bring both legs up to your chest at the same time, then roll your knees to one side and then the other., You can also try basic bodyweight exercises, such as push-ups and squats. Try spending about five minutes on both.For push-ups, get down on the floor face-down. Your body should be straight out with the balls of your feet on the floor. Place your hands flat on the floor, and push your body up and down. Don't go all the way down to the floor and keep your back straight.If you can't do them on the floor, try pushing off a wall.
For squats, with your feet at shoulder-width, put your hands at the back of your head. With your chest straight, bend your knees to lower yourself towards the floor. Return to the standing position and repeat. Do not let your knees go past your toes., For at least 30 seconds, walk in place. Try pulling your heel all the way up to you buttocks. You can also do bicep curls at the same time by holding your arms face-up and front of you (bent at the elbow) and bringing them up to your chest as you bring up your heel. You can do this exercise for longer, if you prefer.

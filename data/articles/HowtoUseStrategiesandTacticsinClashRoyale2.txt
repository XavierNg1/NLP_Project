 It is a great head-start advantage that should pack a punch on the crown towers! But take great precaution as your opponent may use the advantage of you losing a large part of your elixir.

Wait until your elixir is around or on the ten mark and then place down lots of troops with the elixir!
Remember, though, that the opponent might place down his troops too soon. Quickly place down a cheap troop and position it away from the crossing bridges so that the troops will get distracted quickly giving time.
 Use less elixir to counter a troop than it cost to place it.

Use a knight against witch, musketeer, and giant skeleton.
Use arrows against Minion Horde, but don't use it to counter goblins because they are two elixir and arrows are three.

, Season and saut√© the vegetables one at a time. Once all the vegetables are cooked properly, set aside.
 Place 1 cup of rice in each of the bowls. Arrange the vegetables on top, along with 2 slices of bulgogi for each rice bowl. Make sure it looks appealing. Place a fried egg on top of the rice (the egg can also be raw if you like). Add bulgogi with the rice (bulgogi literally means fire meat).
 Don't add too much because this sauce is pretty spicy!

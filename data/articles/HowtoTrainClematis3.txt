 Clematis plants climb by wrapping their leaf stems around the base of something. Clematis can successfully climb onto base supports made of wire, thin branches, steel rods, wooden dowels, fishing line, or twine.Make sure that whatever surface you choose to use isnâ€™t too wide for the leaf stems to twist around. The diameter should not be more than half an inch wide in diameter., Vine eyes are large metal screws with circular endings that are driven or screwed into brickwork or masonry to create support for a wall. Wire lattice is threaded between them and pulled tightly after the vine eyes are screwed in.Tie the stems of the growing plant to the wire support. This can be done by incorporating metal wire, string, and paper covered twist ties.Check on the ties regularly to make sure that they are not too tight around the delicate growing stems. Loosen them and adjust them as needed., Make sure that the site is not too affected by wind and rain so that a variety of different clematis plants can be grown. Prevent premature rotting in wood areas by treating the bottom of the structure on the ground with a wood preservative., For full coverage, use two clematis plants on either side to create full coverage.Consider using scented clematis plants in those locations to greet passerby with sweet-smelling fragrance.

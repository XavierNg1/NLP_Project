 There are PoD (Print on Demand) and offset printers. PoD printers allow you to start selling your print version with minimal up-front costs, but offset printers can earn you a greater return per book sold and have more printing options. Note that some PoD printers specialize in printing comic books, while others print books in general as well as comics.
 Some people prefer setting up their own official publishing company; others don't mind the self-publishing stigma and take advantages of printing companies that are willing to be considered their book's publisher.
 You're supposed to have one for each format (including each file format) you use to publish your comic book. Some printers offer inexpensive or free ISBNs, but make sure to read the fine print.
 This will open more vendors for you. You can find places to get the barcode images for free, or you can pay a small fee for an easy-to-use file.
 Your printer should have individual instructions for how to get physical copies of your comic book.

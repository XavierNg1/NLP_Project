 This method isn't as fast as the others, but it can keep bottles cool for long periods of time. This may be especially effective if it's a warm and sunny day. It's less messy if your containers are large, and it helps keep your beers chill if you're moving them from other cold storage.
 Look in the shade, not the beating sun. Try to bury your beers along the shore of a river, a lake, or a sea â€“ but be careful if the tide is coming in. The wetter the soil, the better.


You can also pour water onto the ground to keep it moist. This may be the best choice if there is no body of water around, and you have water to spare,

, Dig a hole that's large enough for the beer container. Bury it up to the cap or lid; in general, deeper is cooler. Consider leaving the cap or lid exposed to keep it from getting dirty. If you bury the beers completely, make sure that you don't forget where you left them!

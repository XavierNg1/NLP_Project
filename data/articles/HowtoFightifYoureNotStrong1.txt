 This prevents a surprise attack, and if you can maintain eye contact, you come across as confident and intimidating. Keep in mind where your exits are, and if there’s an opening, take it.;
, Keep your knees slightly bent (and ready to spring), feet shoulder width apart and staggered—weak foot forward. Be on the balls of your feet, and keep them moving—nothing showy, but make your opponent work to hit you. Remember, your punches come from this base (more specifically, your back, strong foot).
 A well-placed uppercut will knock you out in a hurry—and possibly break your jaw. Minimizing this crucial target will minimize the chances of you not walking away.
 Guard your face—weak hand closest, guarding your chin, and strong hand farther out, guarding your face. Elbows should be at a slight angle, protecting your ribs. A good guard will also help defend from a headlock., Making a good fist is crucial. If you have something to hold on to (pen, key fob, or even calluses at the bottom of your fingers), do it—it will support your fist when you strike. Keep your thumb on the outside, and keep your wrist in line with your forearm, otherwise it very well may break.

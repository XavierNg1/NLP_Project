 This retainer is a clear plastic mold of your teeth, with no additional pieces or wires. It should cover the entire row of teeth (top or bottom). Because they are made only of thin plastic, Essix retainers may warp or bend, which makes them not fit properly. If your retainer used to fit, but no longer does, it may need to be fixed or replaced by your dentist., You will need to know whether your retainer is for your top or bottom row of teeth. Make sure the arch points forward, and that the opening can be placed on the correct teeth., Make sure it is close to the correct row of teeth. Don't hold it there for a long time â€” this is a quick step to make sure you push it on all at once.
 Do this quickly after placing it in your mouth. The plastic should fit snugly over your whole row of teeth, and should not move. Make sure your retainer fits over all of your teeth, including in the back to hold it in place. If your retainer is falling out, or not staying in place, you may not have anchored it properly.


Remember not to eat with the retainer placed, as you may break it or hurt your jaw.

 It's in the Dungeon, from chests., I greatly recommend Shadow/Crimson armor for melee users, Jungle Armor for magic users, and Necro Armor for ranged., They contain the chest AND pots, giving extra loot., The Underworld is a very dangerous place, and if you stay for much longer, you'll probably get killed...

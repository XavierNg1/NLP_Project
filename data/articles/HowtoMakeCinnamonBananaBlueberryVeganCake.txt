, Tap out any excess flour.
 Whisk until blended well.
 In a large bowl, combine the vegan butter and sugar. Beat with an electric mixer (with paddle attachment for stand mixers) on medium speed, or with a fork and some gumption if you don't have an electric mixer.
 Using a rubber spatula, fold the dry ingredients into the butter mixture in three batches alternating with the sour cream, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Scrape the batter into the greased-and-floured pan and spread evenly.
 Bake for 10 minutes.
 In a small bowl, combine the blueberries, sugar, cinnamon and flour. Mix with a fork, lightly crushing the blueberries.
 After the cake has baked for 10 minutes, sprinkle the topping evenly over the top of the cake. Continue baking until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes longer. The sides will brown a little.
 Run a knife around the inside edge of the pan to loosen the cake. Using a thick, dry dish towel to protect your hands, invert a large, flat plate on top of the cake pan and, holding both the pan and plate, invert them together. Lift the pan off, then invert a flat serving plate on the bottom of the cake and invert the cake once more so the blueberries are on top.

 Bleach is a caustic chemical, and it strips color away from your hair. As you can imagine, this is not entirely healthy for it, no matter how fashionable it is. Using a repair treatment on your hair shortly after bleaching it can prevent long-term damage and make it easier to treat your hair in the future. Some products to try include:


Fiber Force Shampoo and Conditioner, Schwarzkopf BC Repair, Aveda Dry Remedy Shampoo, etc. ;
, The faster you get the repair product in your hair, the better the results. Massage your scalp gently and slowly work the shampoo from your head down to the tips of the hair.


Try to use the coldest shower water you can, as heat hurts hair.
 You do not want to use blow-dryers or heat to dry off. Use your fingers and a towel to get most of the water off, but let your hair air-dry for the most part.
 Apply it before bed and leave it in overnight. Dry conditioner supplies vital moisture and nutrients needed to keep it healthy and happy.
 One treatment will help your hair, but you need to keep your hair healthy shortly after getting it bleached to prevent it from breaking, getting split ends, or drying out.

 As the diagonal step is taken, pivot on the stationary foot a quarter turn to bring the diagonal foot such the it is a step’s distance behind the stationary foot. The body should then be standing with feet apart and facing a quarter turn to the left of the original position.
 This is done similarly to the above but with a more dramatic pivot. A pivot of any degree between ⅛ and ¾ can actually be taken.

 Once you’ve mastered bakasana and are practicing yoga regularly, you can attempt to move from tripod headstand, which is called Sirsasana II into bakasana.








Sirsana II requires good balance and a strong and engaged core.Only try this transition if you have mastered bakasana and feel comfortable in tripod headstand.Remember that you should never jump into any yoga asana.
 From prasarita padottanasana, begin to lift your toes up off the floor. You can either bring your knees to your chest and then raise your legs up into tripod headstand, or, if you’re a stronger yogi, can lift your legs directly into sirsasana II.









If you choose to lift directly into tripod headstand from wide legged forward bend, be aware that this requires a great deal of balance and abdominal strength. Engaging your mula bandha can significantly help you master this variation., Although this is a much more difficult variation than simple crow pose, it’s much more fun to practice and flows elegantly when done properly. From sirsasana II, bring your knees to your triceps and gently push back into bakasana.








Just as in crow pose, make sure your knees are high up on your arms. They should be close to your armpits.Once your knees are in place, push up on your arms and shift your weight lightly back. This should put you in an optimal crow pose.It may take some practice to make the transition from tripod headstand to crow pose. Playing with it and practicing regularly will help you master this series of asanas.
 Once you’ve finished practicing sirsasana II to bakasana, you can either lower back to malasana, or garland pose, or cycle through a vinyasa. Only perform what asanas you can without losing proper form.

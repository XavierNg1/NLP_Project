 Place in a colander and wash under a running tap.









Remove any obvious debris, such as small stones or twigs.
Remove any beans that don't look up to standard.;
, Pre-soaking the beans helps to break down the oligosaccharides that contribute to increased flatulence.Either slow or quick soak the pinto beans:









Quick soak: Place the pinto beans into a saucepan. Fill with 2-3 cups of water per 1 cup dried beans. Bring to the boil for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover with the lid and let stand for 2 hours before cooking.
Slow soak: Add the beans to a saucepan and water, at a ratio of 2-3 cups water per 1 cup dried beans. Place the lid on the saucepan and put into the refrigerator to soak overnight (minimum 8 hours).
 Never cook beans in the water they've soaked in or you re-introduce the oligosaccharides that contribute to increased flatulence. Always drain the pre-soaked beans and use fresh water for cooking.









Equally important, never add seasonings or salt to the cooking beans. This can change the cooking time and can toughen the beans. Always add seasonings after the pinto beans have been cooked.
 Add either broth or water, at a ratio of 3 cups liquid to 1 cup dried beans. Add the beans, then pour over the water or broth. The liquid should cover the beans by 1-2 inches (2.5-5cm).
 Reduce to a gentle simmer. Cook for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours. Check the water level frequently and top up if needed (always maintain the level of water above the beans). The beans may need an occasional stir with a wooden spoon.









The beans are ready when they're at a consistency suitable for mashing. Remove a bean and press it with a fork to see if it mashes well. If it does, the beans are ready.
Cooking time may vary depending on the size and age of the beans, the humidity and other unknowns. Generally, pinto beans require at least 1 1/2 hours and can even take up to 4 hours to fully cook.
 Drain.

 Once a connection between the laser printer and the network hub or router has been made, the device can be added to the office network.


Open the Start menu, and click Control Panel in the column on the right of the menu.
Switch the view to "Classic," if necessary, and double-click the Printer icon located in the control panel folder. The Printers folder will open on the desktop.
Open the control panel from the Start Menu options and click the Printers icon to open the Printers folder.
Select "Add a printer" from the Printer folder toolbar to open the Add printer dialog box on the desktop.
Select "Add a network, wireless or Bluetooth printer" from the options available in the Add Printer dialog box, and click Next to continue. If connected correctly to the hub or router, the new device will be displayed in the dialog box.
Highlight the laser printer and click the Finish button to exit the dialog box and complete the installation process. The new laser printer has been installed on the office network.

 Put the lid over the milk to help generate heat and to cover the odor.;
, If you can deal with any odors, place it indoors. If not, put it somewhere outside where it cannot be attacked by vermin.
 When the milk has solidified and become crumbly (about 3-4 days), it is ready to become chicken feed. Crumble it loosely and share with the hens! If preferred, place it into a feeding container of some sort to prevent it mingling with soil.

 Count the number of holes on your computer or handheld device's S Video input and the number of pins in the connector at the end of the cable. If the number of holes matches up with the number of pins, you can connect the cables.


S Video cables come in 4-pin, 7-pin, and 9-pin varieties. Take a careful look at each end of any S Video cable when you purchase it; you can purchase cables to connect 2 different types of S Video connectors. For example, 1 end of the cable might have a 4-pin connector while the other end has a 7-pin connector.;
,,, In some cases, you must connect the 2 devices before turning them on, or the new device won't be properly recognized.

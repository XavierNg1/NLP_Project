 Dogs feel least threatened by people whose body is oriented away from them. Encourage your visitors to turn in profile, keeping only their head aimed in the dog’s direction, and avoiding direct eye contact until the dog feels more comfortable around the guest.Your visitor should sit or squat at the dog’s level when greeting it for the first time.
Instead of looking directly into the dog’s eyes, your guest should examine some piece of art on the wall or talk directly to you instead of addressing or interacting with the dog.
Encourage your guest to use their indoor voice when around your dog and discourage yelling and boisterous behavior, including raising their arms or standing up suddenly.
Discourage your guest from petting your new dog.
 Your dog should sit or stay when visitors arrive. As soon as the visitors come in, say “Sit” or “Stay” to your leashed dog. Only then should you actually proceed with the process of introducing the new dog to the visitor.If your new dog does not know how to “sit,” teach it how by taking it to an obedience school or “puppy kindergarten.” Alternately, you could teach it yourself.
 If you have two or more dogs, you should introduce them to guests one at a time, rather than in a pack. When multiple dogs – new or old – are in one location doing something exciting like meeting a visitor, they could get overly excited. This abundance of energy and excitement could lead to conflict among the dogs.

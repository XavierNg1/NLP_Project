 There are many glass polishers available on the market. You can either select a glass polishing kit, which comes complete with specialized polishing discs that can remove more severe scratches or blemishes, or you can simply choose a high quality glass restorer that removes light spots and scratches., The polisher needs to have a speed setting between 1000 and 1200 RPM, and it must have a polishing pad.
, Use as much as directed on the product label, or apply an even spread of polish across the entire pad.
 Hold the handle with your dominant hand and use your other hand to guide the polisher. Do not apply pressure, since the pad will apply enough pressure on its own to polish the glass.
 Move the machine from side to side at a gradual pace. Do not jerk the rotary polisher around, since doing so will increase the likelihood of accidentally damaging your glass. Keep going until the entire surface of the glass has been moistened with polish, and stop the machine once the polish begins to dry.


Be aware of the fact that the rotary polisher has a specific pattern of movement. When moved to the right, the machine also moves upward. When moved to the left, the machine also moves downward. Do not fight the rhythm of the machine. Instead, learn to work with it.
 Use a clean microfiber cloth to buff the residue away using even, gentle pressure and a small circular motion. Continue buffing until no streaks or residue remains.
 Your car glass is now completely stripped. A glass sealant helps the glass stay smooth and clear for a longer period of time by sealing the pores of the glass. Apply a small amount of sealant onto an automotive sponge and wipe the sponge across the glass, moving from side to side and up to down. Use as much sealant as necessary to seal the entire exterior surface of the glass.

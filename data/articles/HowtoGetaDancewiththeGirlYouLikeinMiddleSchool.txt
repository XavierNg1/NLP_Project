 Do not follow her! It will seem weird and stalkerish, just wait until she comes back in and then find out where she is going (e.g. back in the middle, sides, front etc.);
, She might get taken.
 "hey, wanna dance?" or "mind if I dance with you?") if she says no, don't be discouraged! Keep being friendly with her, and let it go.
If it's a fast song, you got to be quick! Ask her if she wants to dance but don't drag it out like , "May I have this dance with you?"

, Hold just above her hips, that way its not too low or too high. Don't hold too tight. also, don't hold her too softly! If you do she will think you are insecure or scared and/or not confident! Girls like confident guys!

 Skyr is becoming more common internationally, but depending on where you live, it may be somewhat difficult to find. Skyr is often stocked in the dairy or yogurt section of grocery stores, like Whole Foods and Aldi. Some flavors that might be available include:Blueberry
Papaya
Peach
Plain
Raspberry
Strawberry
Vanilla;
, If you have a large container of skyr, spoon out a portion for yourself into a bowl. If your skyr came in a single serving pack, open this. Then spoon the skyr from the container up to your mouth and enjoy.


There's no special trick or dining etiquette for eating skyr. Generally, traditional Icelandic dining is relaxed and similar to most European countries.Be careful not to take too much on the first bite. Skyr is quite thick, and can be a little overwhelming in large quantities.
 Due to the wide range of flavors and its nutritional value, skyr is a flexible food. Much like yogurt, it can be served with breakfast as a side. You might even mix it with granola or cereal to give a healthy start to your day. However, since many Icelanders consider skyr an on-the-go treat, single serving cups equipped with a disposable spoon are common.


You can add ingredients to your skyr to transform its flavor. For example, you might add berries, a splash of cream, a sprinkling of brown sugar, and so on to your skyr.

 Mint is mature when it begins to bloom (after about 90 days), but it can be harvested any time after it is 3 to 4 inches tall. Trimming your mint plant regularly will allow it to become full and healthy. You'll also be able to use fresh mint after each mini harvest.


Make sure to trim your mint carefully each time it needs to be cut back. Remember to trim the mint so it grows in the rough shape of the pot you're using. If you're trimming mint outside, make sure to trim mint so mint plants do not overgrow your garden.
While you can use shears to prune mint, small plants can easily be pruned just using your fingers.
 Small pieces of mint can be used in many recipes. If a recipe calls for dry mint, try using freshly cut mint in its place. This can add a stronger mint flavor. You can all add mint leaves to beverages like lemonade or mojitos to add flavor., If you want more mint plants, you can create them using the trimmings from your existing mint plant. Clip off 6 inches of a stem from your mint plant, and place it in a pot filled with potting soil. This stem will transform into its own plant with lots of sunshine and water.Fill a plant with potting soil mixed with a heavy amount of compost. Take the stem you cut from the original mint plant and slide it into the soil.
You can also place mint stems in a glass of water. Remove any leaves that would sit below the water line or they will rot. Eventually, roots will start to grow.

 If you have a hard time getting your hair wet, try combing it under running water as well.;
, Some shampoos dry your hair out, making it brittle and unmanageable. Massage your scalp gently, using back and forth motions rather than circular motions that twist your hair and break it. Rinse thoroughly with warm water.
 Make sure that you don't put this on your scalp. Massage it gently into your hair, from the nape of your neck down to the ends. Wait 5 minutes, and then rinse with warm water.
 This will give it a healthy shine.
, Use a comb to pull one section over each shoulder and leave one on your back.
 Start at the roots and work your way down gently. Take about as long as ten minutes on each sectionÂ to fully distribute the natural oils. Yes, this does take a while, but do this twice daily and you will see miraculous results.
, This is a slow process, but you want to ensure that the oils have been evenly distributed. For some, this may take an hour if they have extremely thick hair, but it's worth it. Don't rush!

, Enjoy your smooth, healthy, shiny hair!

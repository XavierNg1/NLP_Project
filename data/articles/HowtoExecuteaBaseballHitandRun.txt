There is a batting lineup that will be announced to the team by either a coach or teammate before the game.
When you are two slots away from being the current batter you are "in the hole".
When you are one slot away from being the current batter you are "on deck" and may warm up in the on deck circle.;

Signalling a timeout will ensure the pitcher cannot pitch to you while you are receiving your signals from your coach.



Be sure to keep one foot in batter's box.



Signals will usually be established during a practice or a meeting by your coach so that you know what gestures and movements stand for which action you will need to perform.

Each strike zone will vary based on the umpires decision.
If you miss hitting the ball, follow further direction from your third base coach or refer back to the process for signalling a time-out.
The runner that is at any three of the bases should be running to the next base as soon as the pitcher commits his or her front foot towards the home plate.



If you do miss your swing, you may still distract the catcher enough to let the on-base runner advance to the next base.
If you hit the ball to the left of the third base line or right of the first base line then the ball is considered a foul ball.
The ball must be hit in fair territory which is considered inside the first and third base lines.
Refer to the time-out process again.



As you approach first base watch and listen to your first base coach and follow his or her direction.
If you can run to the next base you need to round the base
Rounding a base is done by angling outward once you are about 2/3 of the way to the base and slowly angling back towards the bag and when you place your foot on the bag you should be facing the direction of the next base you will be running to.



While you are running on the base path, it can be hard to determine what to do so after rounding first base make sure to watch your third base coach to follow directions.

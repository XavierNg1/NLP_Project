 If your institution doesn’t have an SDK or SEK programs, you may ask your school’s CAD administrator if you can request a borrowed license for temporary use.
 Solidworks will be installed on your machine through your institution’s computer network, so you may need to ask for assistance from any IT personnel on how to connect your PC to your school’s network.
 When prompted to enter a license for the software, enter the borrowed license given to you by your administrator.
 Borrowed licenses require you to stay connected to the network while you’re using Solidworks.


Borrowed licenses only last up to 30 days, so you may want to ask your CAD administrator for any chance of renewal if you need to use the application for more than a month.

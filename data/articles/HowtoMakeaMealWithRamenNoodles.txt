 This small convenient attachment may bring flavor to the noodles, but contains a heavy amount of sodium; reportedly a little over the maximum daily recommendation.

Add creamy sauces, such as ranch dressing or creamy condensed soups.
Put protein in the dish, for example sliced cooked chicken, pork, or beef. Fried eggs and even tofu can satisfy anyone.
Mix it with hot dogs and mac & cheese.

 Young cats develop quickly, and can readily create emotional bonds while they are between 2 and 12 weeks old.If you’re in communication with the cat breeder, cat foster home, or animal shelter, specify that you’d like a cat within this age range. Many shelters will not adopt cats as young as 2 weeks (the cats will still need their mothers), but you should be able to adopt your kitten well before it’s 12 weeks old.


Ideally, look for a kitten around 8 weeks old. The kitten will be independent enough to not need its mother anymore, and ready to bond and play with a new owner., Naming an animal will help you feel more personally connected to it. Names indicate possession, closeness, and connection, and can help give your new kitten a sense of personality. When considering names for your kitten, think of:


The name of a favorite pet from childhood.
The name of a popular character from a beloved book or film.
 During the first several days after you adopt your kitten, keep it in a single room in your house, so it does not become overwhelmed by its new environment.This room should contain the kitten’s bed, food, water, and litter box, as well as a few toys for the kitten to play with.


Try to create a place in the house where you and your kitten can relax. For example, you can lay some blankets and pillows down on the floor.
When kittens are born the mother usually sleeps next to her newborns. If you do the same the kitten will see you as a motherly figure and find trust in you.
 Kittens have unique personalities, and will respond to different stimuli in different manners. Some kittens may be shy, and will quickly become scared if you play too aggressively or start introducing the kitten to too many people or objects at once. If your kitten acts fearful or nervous, give it some space and stop interacting.Nervous behaviors include:


Moving away from you.
Twitching or tensing its muscles.
Acting hyper-alert and reacting to stimuli with fear.

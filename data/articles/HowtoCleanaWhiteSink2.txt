 Find an oxygenated bleach in powder form and mix it with water according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Dip 2 to 3 rags in the mixture, depending on how large the sink is, and lay the saturated rags along the bottom of the sink. Leave the rags alone for 15 minutes, take them off and scrub any remaining stains with a non abrasive brush.Hang saturated rags over the edge of your sink to remove any stains along the sides.
 Rust or any other stubborn stains don’t stand a chance to a DIY cleaner made from salt and lemon juice. Sprinkle table salt on any stains, cut a lemon in half to squeeze it juice directly over the salt, and scrub with a clean dish rag. Rinse the area with water and repeat if necessary.
 Liquid dishwasher soap is strong stuff and you only need to leave it on your white sink for a short time to cut through grease, grime and stains. Squirt a small amount onto a soft rag or sponge and wipe your sink down all over with it. Don’t walk away, and rinse your sink with water after one minute.

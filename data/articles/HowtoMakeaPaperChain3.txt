 If you leave the chain long, you can string it through a space to add a festive flair. Hang the chain a little bit loose, so that it dips low in the center. Try crossing chains over one another, alternating colors, or even linking long chains together to make a super-chain.


If you're having a party, use a waist- or chest-level paper chain to block off a "private area" like a staircase, a hallway, or a section of backyard. The paper may not hold up to force, but it will serve as a gentle deterrent to wayward guests.
 You can string up paper chains for a birthday, a party, or a major holiday. Match the colors of the chains to the theme of the party, or to the colors usually associated with that holiday. Get creative!, If winter or Christmas is coming up, try making a faux-wreath using one or more paper chains. For the basic design: use green construction paper, then loop the finished chain into one large circle. You can add concentric small green circles to fill out the "wreath." For added effect, make a "bow" from red paper or string, and tie it to the front of the wreath.


Hang the wreath on your door, your wall, your fence, your tree. The paper wreath should be light, and easy to attach with tape or a hook.
 Tie a series of (preferably small) loops together into a large loop that fits around your neck. For best effect, make the individual links rather small: not much more than half an inch wide and two inches long. One idea: string an array of bright, colorful loops together into a paper "lei" – a traditional Hawaiian flower necklace. Try looping a long chain of tight golden links into a "gold chain" – perhaps even two chains!

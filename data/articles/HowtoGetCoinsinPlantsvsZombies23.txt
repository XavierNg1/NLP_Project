 Daily Events are special and unique games not found on any of the Worlds or Levels. These get refreshed every day.


Once you completed a Daily Event, you can no longer play it again.
 Meet the goals of the Daily Event and defeat the zombies. You won’t get any reward if you aren’t successful.
 When you complete the Daily Event, you will be given a screen containing 16 party piñatas. Tap on three of these to uncover rewards. Rewards can range from a small amount of coins to 3,500 coins. They can also contain special plant costumes and gems.

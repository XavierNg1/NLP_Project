 Open your cupboard and find the can of beans. You should see an expiry date printed on the top or bottom of the can. It might be printed in small letters so you should make sure you have adequate lighting in the room.


If you use glasses, you may want to put on your glasses before checking the expiry date.;
, Place a can opener on the side of the can and turn the can opener in a clockwise direction until you have opened the can. Pull up the top of the can with your fingers, a knife or a fork. If the can of beans has a ring pin, you can just pull the pin upwards to open it.


If you do not have a regular can opener, you can use the can opener on a swiss army or other utility knife can opener.If you do not have a can opener, it is best to go to the store and pick one up.
Although one can use other implements, such as a sharp knife, it can be dangerous to open a can of beans without a can opener., It is very important to drain the can of beans because beans are stored in water and salt based brine. Although there is nothing wrong with eating the brine, it contains a lot of sodium that you may not want to use in your recipe. Pour the beans into a colander in the sink and rinse them with cold water to remove the brine and excess sodium.

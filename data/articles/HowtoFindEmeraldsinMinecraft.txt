 This is the only biome where emeralds will be found. Extreme hills biomes are fairly common, so you won't have to go very far.;
, Don't dig straight down, or you'll probably fall in lava. Emeralds can be found anywhere from levels 4-32, but level 11 is best. To see what level you are on, press F3 and look at the y-coordinate.
 You can also make "branches", or little tunnels branching off from the main tunnel.
 If there is, you could get a nasty surprise.
 Take your reward and either head out of your mine or continue looking for emeralds.

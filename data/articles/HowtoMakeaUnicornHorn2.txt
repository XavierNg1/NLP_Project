 You need a party hat that is made from lightweight cardboard to make a unicorn horn. You can find them at your local party store and some grocery stores.
 Find out where the hat is connected, and undo it so you can roll it out flat. If the party hat is taped, remove the tape or gently cut the tape to undo it. If the hat is glued together, carefully use scissors to separate it. Then, unroll the party hat out flat.








Keep the elastic attached to the hat

, To make the horn, you need to roll the hat up again, but roll it tighter than it was before. Start with one side of the party hat, and roll it towards the other side creating a tighter roll. Keep rolling until you have a nice tight cone shape.
 Use tape to secure the hat into the horn shape. Use a hot glue gun, or put several pieces of tape on the outer edge of the party hat to secure it to the hat.
 Put the base of the horn on top of your forehead and pull the elastic over the back of your head to wear your new unicorn horn.

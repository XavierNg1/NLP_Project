 The exact amount doesn't matter -- you just need enough to work with comfortably.
 Simply double the yarn back on itself, then slide the end underneath the rest of the yarn to make a circle.
 Make sure you flip it towards the side with the rest of the yarn, not the side with the end of the yarn.
 Simply pinch the straight line of yarn underneath your loop and pull it through 1-2". It should naturally form another loop.
 You only want to tighten it enough to close the first loop you made, leaving the other loop open on top. It looks a bit like a noose.
 Put the knitting needle in through the remaining loop and pull both ends of yarn to make it snug.

 Roux are an important element of Cajun cooking. Gumbo, a classic Cajun dish, is frequently thickened with blonde or dark roux, depending on the recipe. Make a roux and add ingredients like okra, peppers, sausage, chicken, shrimp, and chicken stock for a delicious dish.
 Gratin dishes like potato, cauliflower or tomato gratin have a creamy, cheesy sauce that is built from blonde roux. The roux is thinned with milk and poured over vegetables, then topped with plenty of cheese.
 Making macaroni and cheese from scratch is as easy as creating a roux, thinning it with milk, pouring it over cooked noodles and topping with a mix of cheeses.
 This French sauce is the foundation of many pasta dishes.

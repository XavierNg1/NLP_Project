 more people means a longer game, however it also gets quite challenging to keep track of who's "it" or not;
, If you have roughly 8 people you'll need maybe little over a single street or a small park. 8-15 players will require perhaps a whole complex, and 15-20+ players will need something like a large picnic place, forest or soccer park. You should also find a time to play (any time of day is fine, but I personally prefer around dusk. Just remember not to stay out too late!)

, This can be done easily by "eenie-meenie-miney-moe" if, for some reason, you don't know what that is, it's basically all of the players standing in a circle with their foot extended towards the centre. A player then recites the rhyme either "eenie-meenie" or "sky-blue" and moves down one player each word. Whoever's foot the counter's hand lands on when the rhyme is over is either "out" (exempt from being "it") or "it" (the outcome of the chosen person is to be agreed upon beforehand)

, So as to let the Hiders get away and hide. This time is usually 20-30 seconds (depending on the number of participants and size of the playing area)

, Some ways to do this are: Hide high up (such as in a tree) or down low, Wear dark, matte (not shiny) clothes, Constantly being mobile (moving)

, You can do this by: Chasing down one single player (if you have good endurance and speed), Ganging up on a group of hiders, "Camping" (Staying in one place for a long duration of time), Hiding within a bush and popping out when Hiders pass by, Setting "traps" (such as one Hunter chasing a Hider into a group of Hunters)

, Buy some walkie-talkies from Walmart or get your hands on an air horn to signal to everyone that the round has ended

 Dress your Barbies in swimsuits and fill a dish with water. Play music, set up play food, add beach towels, etc.
 Choose one Barbie to host the sleepover and the other Barbies as guests. Have games and snacks.


Make Barbie-sized sleeping bags. This simple to do––cut rectangular pieces of scrap fabric a little longer than barbie and twice as wide. Stitch down the two long edges and one short edge. Leave the other short edge open to allow Barbie entry into the bag. Make a pillow as well.
Give Barbie a house warming party. Barbie can get little house warming gifts from her friends like house plants and pictures frames. Have the party when Barbie is all moved in or arrange little boxes around her new house or apartment like she's still moving in.

 Not too open though. Go through the clothes that you have and experiment hairstyles and makeup styles that work for you.;
, If you are tomboy then don't be girlie the next day. Change is good, but if you keep changing then you can't be a fashion icon to somebody.
 If somebody compliments you don't put yourself down.
 You want to stand out! Be different. So what if your school mates are slack and don't care. If you do, and you keep dressing nice, people will get the urge to follow in your footsteps. And what feels better then to be a leader then a follower?

, You don't need to be someone you're not just for the people who you like. Be who you want, not who they want you to be! For the people that are reading this, they will probably want basics. But this advice is really helpful. Try it. Do it. Be a fashion icon. You never know what's in store up along your road.

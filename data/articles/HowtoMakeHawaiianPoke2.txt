 Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of sesame oil, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of soy sauce, 1 English cucumber that’s been peeled and thinly sliced, 5 scallions that have been sliced on the bias, 1 thinly sliced red chile, 1 tablespoon of pulverized nori, and kosher salt to taste to a large bowl. Stir the ingredients together well so they’re fully blended.When you’re cutting the scallions, make sure to include only the white and tender green parts.
Be careful to remove the stem and seeds from the red chile before adding it to the bowl.
Nori is another type of edible seaweed. For the poke, you can use the sheets usually meant to wrap sushi. If you crush approximately 3 of the sheets, you’ll have the seaweed you need for the recipe.
 Once all of the other ingredients are mixed, add 12 ounces (340 g) of boiled octopus that’s been cut into ½-inch (13-mm) cubes into the bowl. Use a spatula to gently fold the octopus in so it’s fully incorporated.You can purchase boiled octopus at many Japanese markets.
You can boil the octopus yourself if you prefer. Fill a large pot with salted water and bring it to a boil over high heat. Add the octopus and boil it for 10 minutes or until it is cooked through to the center. Immediately, place it in an ice water bath to stop the cooking.
 After all of the ingredients are mixed, leave the poke to sit at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes. That allows all of the flavors to come together.Octopus poke is not a good dish to prepare ahead of time. You’ll get the best flavor if you mix it right before you plan to eat it.
 After you’ve let the poke sit for several minutes, spoon it in individual bowls to serve. It makes an ideal appetizer or first course, though you can serve it with rice as a meal.The octopus poke recipe makes approximately 6 to 8 servings.

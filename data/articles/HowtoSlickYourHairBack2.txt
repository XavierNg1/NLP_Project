 Shampoo your hair and dry it, but not all the way. This style looks best on hair that is slightly damp. Your hair will dry in the modern slicked position, helping it stay in place throughout the day.
 Use your fingers to run pomade through your hair, focusing on the top and sides. For this style, you can use either maximum hold pomade or a medium hold product. Keep in mind that a medium hold product will allow your hair to move more, creating a "messy" overall appearance. If you prefer a neater look, use maximum hold pomade.
 Modern slicked hair can be parted on either side if desired. Use a comb to part your hair on either the right or the left side, keeping in mind that both sides will be slicked toward the back. Avoid a middle part.
 Use a fine-toothed barber comb to comb your hair back from your forehead to the crown of your head. Just comb each section once. For this style, you want the roots to maintain some volume, rather than lying completely flat.









With the modern slick, you can choose not to slick back the sides. This works particularly well if you have a fade haircut, with much shorter hair on the sides than on top.
If you do have long hair on the sides, slick it from your temples to the back of your head.
 The modern slick has volume and movement. After initially combing your hair back, put the comb down and use your fingers to achieve the look you want. Run your fingers through your hair and gently lift it at the roots so that it doesn't lie flat.









You can use a hair dryer set to low to help add volume as you finger comb. Be sure to point it from your forehead toward your crown so that your hair dries in a slicked back pattern.Use more pomade as necessary to create the look you want.

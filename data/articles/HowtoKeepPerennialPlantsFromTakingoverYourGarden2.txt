 Deadheading perennials is removing spent or faded blooms from the plant. Deadheading allows plants to focus their energy on blooming, rather than going to seed. Without deadheading, some self-seeding perennials will drop seeds in the soil, which may emerge the following growing season as new plants. To keep perennials from overtaking your garden, deadhead blooms to keep the plants from producing seeds.
 Not all perennials self-seed. Consult a garden catalog or online perennial resource to determine whether your plants will go to seed if not deadheaded. A few common perennials that self-seed include: yarrow, bugleweed, purple coneflower, orange coneflower, sweet violet, bishop's goutweed, lady's mantle, aster, columbine and maiden pink.
 Remove spent blooms by pinching them off with your thumb and forefinger, or clipping them with shears.
, Invasive perennials spread rapidly and are difficult to control. They may spread by seeds or by roots. Because the growth patterns of perennials depend on factors like temperature, soil and sunlight, perennials may be considered invasive in some geographic areas, but not in others. Check with your local garden center, extension office or the United States National Arboretum website for a list of invasive perennials in your area.


Put together a list of local invasive perennials so you avoid planting them in the future. A few perennials that are considered invasive in some geographic regions include: purple loosestrife, English ivy, Japanese honeysuckle, butterfly bush and water hyacinth.
 If you have invasive perennials in your garden, remove them immediately. Dig out the entire root system and dispose of the plant. If a plant spreads by seeds, an invasive plant in your garden could affect neighboring gardens and habitats.

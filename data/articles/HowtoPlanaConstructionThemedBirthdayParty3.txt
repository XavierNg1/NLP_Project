 Check with your guestsâ€™ parents about allergies. Focus on simple finger foods like pretzels and baby carrots that you can serve in the plastic trucks. If you get ice cream, go for more than one flavor since children tend to prefer ice cream over cake., Make a chocolate cake and sprinkle crushed oreos on it for dirt. Put small construction trucks on the cake as decoration. You can also make dirt pudding. Use store bought chocolate pudding cups or make your own pudding and put it in cups. Crush oreos on top for dirt and decorate each cup with a truck the guests can keep as party favors.Keep it very simple by buying a cake decorated with a construction theme from your local grocery store or bakery.
 You can buy plain goody bags in one of your theme colors or buy goodie bags that have a construction theme. You could also use beach pails and shovels in your theme colors. Add a small truck, a length of caution tape, and a toy hard hat or a small building game, like a Lego Mixel.

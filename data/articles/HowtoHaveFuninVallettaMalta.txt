 This cafe is found on South Street, the corner of which is marked by a green shop. Any local should be able to point you in the right direction. This cafe is a remnant of what Malta used to look like in the 1960s, and if you're not interested in the food, it's worth a visit just for the decoration!;
, This is a large building built into the old city defences, which almost always has an art exhibition inside. It's a great place just to pop in to to see if anything's going on.
 The garden offers stunning views of the Grand Harbour of Valletta. It's definitely a great place to take photos. Also, a nice bar which serves ftira (large sandwiches) is located nearby!

, This is a large fort located at the tip of Valletta, which is in the process of being restored. Despite not being open to the public, the fort is stunning, and worth a photo. It is located in a slightly run-down area, but it's perfect for photos. The National War Museum is also located in the fort.
 These are World War II bunkers found in the ditch below the city. They are well restored and interesting, so check them out! If you are not a fan of history, this might not be for you.
Â This cathedral is open to visitors and the inside has a stunning Caravaggio Painting! It is very popular, so expect to queue.

 Place the ground beef and onion in a medium skillet and cook the two ingredients over medium-high heat until the beef is completely browned.


Use your spatula to break apart the ground beef as it browns. When done, the beef should be divided into small crumbles.






Drain the ground beef and onion mixture before moving on.





;
, Cut the cheese product into 1-inch cubes using a sharp knife.


Splitting the cheese into smaller blocks will allow it to melt quicker and more evenly.
 Place the cubed cheese, undrained Rotel, and drained beef mixture in a 3-qt (3-L) microwave-safe dish. Stir the ingredients well.


The cheese blocks, Rotel tomatoes, beef, and onions should distributed relatively evenly throughout the bowl.






Consider covering the bowl loosely with a paper towel to prevent its contents from splattering inside the microwave.
 Microwave the mixture for 5 minutes, or until the cheese product has melted and the ingredients are well-blended.Stop the microwave cycle every 1 to 2 minutes to stir the mixture. Doing so distributes the heat more evenly and promotes consistent melting.
 The dip is now melted and ready to serve. Keep the dish warm while serving it.


You could reheat the dip when it starts to cool, but it might be easier to keep it cool by placing it in a small slow cooker or warming dish and switching the device onto a "warm" setting.
This dip is typically served with tortilla chips, corn chips, or crackers.

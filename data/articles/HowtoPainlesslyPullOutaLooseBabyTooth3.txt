 The firmness of hard foods will either cause the tooth to get stuck in the food and pulled from your child’s gums, or else just dislodge the loose tooth.Only do this when the tooth is very loose; otherwise it may cause your child unnecessary pain and swelling which may require a visit to the dentist. Examples of hard foods that can knock the tooth out include:


Crunchy carrots.
Crispy apples or peaches.
Caramel or gum to chew.
 Of course, you child should already be flossing daily, but remind them that flossing is important. Often the fibers of the floss will catch in or under the loose tooth and pull it painlessly from your child’s mouth.Only attempt this when the tooth is already very loose. If you child attempts to use floss to remove a tooth that is not ready to fall out, the process will be painful and your child could end up tearing their gums.
 If your child has a persistently loose tooth that does not come out on its own, or is uncommonly painful for the child, take him or her to the dentist.A dentist can assess if the tooth is healthy, or if it’s falling out prematurely, perhaps due to a cavity or other infection.


A pediatric dentist will also be able to tell you if your child’s permanent adult teeth are coming in correctly.

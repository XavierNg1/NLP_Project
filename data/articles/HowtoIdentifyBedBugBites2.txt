 Check for reddish-brown, wingless, flat insects that are about 0.1 cm to 0.7 cm. Examine the folds of mattresses and sheets for the bugs. Also look for exoskeletons that bed bugs might have shed. Search too for tiny white eggs or eggshells, which are about 0.1 cm, or white bed bug larvae which are about the same size.Recall that 0.4 cm is the equivalent of an inch.
 Look for reddish or rusty stains on your sheets. These might be caused either by crushed bugs or by the bugs’ fecal matter. Wipe any dark or red dots you see on your bedding. If they smear or spread, they are likely bed bug excrement., Look for any signs of bed bugs in your bed frame and in the space between your bed frame and the wall. Also look for bed bugs around your headboard. Check for them in the piping, seams, and tags of your sheets, mattress, and box spring. Be sure to look inside pillow cases and on any throw pillows you might have on your bed., In less extreme cases, bed bugs can be present even if they’re not at all visible to the naked eye. Take the age of the mattress and cleanliness of the sheets into consideration. If this happens in a hotel room, check to see if the mattress is covered by a plastic sheet. If not, then there’s a much higher chance of infestation.

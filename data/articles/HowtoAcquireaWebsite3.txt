 When you have your sights set on a website that you wish to buy, do a bit of research. Find out about its history. If they have a forum, check it out. If the website has statistics available, review them.


You can check into a website's history using a couple of methods. You can view a website's history of popularity by consulting the Alexa website ranking service. You can view previous versions of a website by using the Wayback Machine online service. You can view information regarding a website's domain name by performing a WHOIS lookup. All of these services are sourced below.
 If you're absolutely sure you want to purchase the website, then browse the website and find a contact email address for the owner. In the email, introduce yourself and express your liking of the site, but do not tell them yet that you're interested in buying the site. Use the first few emails to gauge the owner's interest in their own site.
 Once you've let the owner know that you want to purchase their website, you'll need to negotiate an acceptable price for both parties. Ask the owner for information regarding visitor traffic, site revenues, site costs, and other site statistics. The negotiating process can be very short or very long depending on the website owner's willingness to compromise.
 Create a contract outlining all of the points of the sale and have both parties date and sign it. It would be a good idea to have a lawyer look over the contract to verify its validity. Once the contract is signed, make the payment and have the owner transfer everything related to the site over to your name.

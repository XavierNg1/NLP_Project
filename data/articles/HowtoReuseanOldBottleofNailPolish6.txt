 Use the method above for this.
 Some suggestions include: Glitter, sequins, seed or tiny beads, small buttons, tiny modeling items, etc. Simply fill the bottle with these items, then attach the lid (with the brush snapped off). When you need the little items or glitter, they'll be very easy to locate and use.
 If you're tired of tipping up the huge bottle of craft glue every time, siphon some into the little glass bottle. Use the brush applicator in the lid to apply glue to your craft projects with ease.
 This makes it easy to mix colors too and keep the mixed color longer.

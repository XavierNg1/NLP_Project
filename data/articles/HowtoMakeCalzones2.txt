 Heat a little cooking oil in a skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot, place the sausage in the pan. Brown the sausage on one side for 5 minutes, then turn it over and brown it on the other side. Cook the sausage until it has thoroughly cooked through. Remove the meat from the skillet and set it aside.
 Add the onions to the skillet and saut√© them until they become translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for one minute more.
 Place the salt, pepper, and oregano in the pan and stir well.
 Place the tomatoes and mushrooms in the skillet with the onions. Let the mixture simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. The filling should become thick and fragrant. If it seems too runny after 20 minutes, continue cooking for another 10 minutes.
 Stir the meat back into the skillet. Remove the skillet from heat and prepare to fill the calzones.

 Fold a square scarf (silk preferably) diagonally to create a large triangle shape. Starting at the widest side of the triangle, roll







, Find a small scarf in a lightweight fabric (square silk scarves typically work best) and pull your hair into a ponytail with one of the corners of the scarf tucked into the loop. Section your hair into three pieces, and add the scarf to one of the strands. Braid your hair as you usually would, weaving the scarf into your hair as you go. Knot off the end with an elastic band and wrap the scarf around it, and tuck the end in place.
 This style is best for adorning updos and when your hair is pulled back from your face. Style your hair as you would normally, and then wrap a small, thin scarf around the elastic band or hair clip that you've used to pin your hair up. Tie the scarf in a bow, and adjust the fabric as necessary to make it more attractive.
 Take a large square scarf and fold it in half diagonally to create a large triangle. Drape this over your head so that the widest side of the triangle is above your forehead, and the two tail ends are near the nape of your neck. Tie the tail ends in a knot or a bow underneath your hair at the base of your neck. This style is great for bad hair days, or when you need to keep your hair out of your face.

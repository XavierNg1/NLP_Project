 Set up a few interviews. If you know people who use personal chefs, speak with them about setting up an interview with their personal chefs.;
, Not all personal chefs belong to a professional chef organization, but that doesn't mean they aren't reputable cooks. A certified or professionally affiliated chef has met certain standards and undergone training in safe food handling and preparation.
 Have the chef show you sample menus and explain how they operate. This is also the time to discuss what the chef charges and how you'll be expected to pay.
 Some people want a chef that has professional training, while others are perfectly fine working with a chef who is self-trained.
 A number of accidents can happen in the kitchen, so you need to make sure that your personal chef carries liability insurance in case of an accident.
 Personal chefs have a number of clients and usually only visit once a week to prepare meals. Private chefs usually live with the client or visit every day and prepare meals as needed.
 Ask the other clients their opinions about the chef's food, ability to follow dietary guidelines and their overall personality.
 This means they will prepare one meal for you so that you can see their cooking style and ability to clean your kitchen to your standards. Not every chef advertises this option, but it doesn't hurt to ask.
 A long-term contract means you'll have trouble firing the chef should you find that he or she doesn't meet your needs.

 Boost your self-confidence so you feel less self-conscious about your lisp using daily positive affirmations. Repeat affirmations like “I am brave,” “I am bold,” and “I will not be bothered.” Say the affirmations in the mirror at the beginning of your day or before you go to sleep. You may choose positive affirmations that do not contain “s” or “z” sounds so your lisp does not come out when you say them. This may help you feel more confident.
 If you have to speak in front of others, get in the habit of avoiding words that you struggle with because of your lisp. For example, if you struggle with “s” words like “so” or “simply,” avoid them. Say words that are easier for you to pronounce.If you are writing a speech, avoid words that are hard for you to say aloud. Replace them with easier words or work around them so you do not have to worry about your lisp getting in the way of your presentation.
 Sometimes, you cannot help mispronouncing a word because of your lisp. Rather than feel embarrassed about it, try to laugh it off and move on with the conversation. Make a joke about how you just cannot get that word right and replace it with an easier word or skip the word and move on.Doing this can help to diffuse the situation and make you feel less self-conscious about your lisp. It can also show others that you are still confident despite your lisp and are not deterred by your speech impediment.

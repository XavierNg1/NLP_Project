 Tape the edges around window and door frames as well along the ceiling; then begin applying a coat of primer. The primer will provide a clean and light palette for the space, making it easier to cover the paneling completely with one or two coats of paint. Allow the primer coat to dry for at least a few hours or overnight for the best results.


Mix and aerate the primer adequately before applying to the wood paneling. Using and up-and-down circular motion, mix the primer so that it distributes more evenly when you apply it to the paneling.
Use a primer specifically designed for wood for best results. Many wood primers are water-based, meaning that they dry relatively quickly (2 to 4 hours). This gives you less time spent on the job.
 You can use a sanding tool for this, but you don't want to overdo it, so you might be better off just sanding by hand. Sand lightly but evenly for better adhesion when you finally cover with paint.


Remember to rub off any sawdust or residue after sanding with a tack cloth or a clean brush. Sawdust and grime are the enemy of a polished, professional look.
 Use a brush to cut in around windows, doors and the ceiling. Once the edge work is done, begin painting the walls using brushes, rollers or paint sprayers. Apply an even coat and allow it to dry for a day or so before evaluating.
 Depending on the tone of the paneling and the effectiveness of the primer, two or three coats will normally be sufficient to create the look you want. Inspect the paint and make sure it is completely dry before moving furniture back into the room.


If you really want an even, smooth look, use fine sandpaper and terry cloth to hit the coat of paint before you apply another coat.
 Inspect your lovely new wood paneling and congratulate yourself. You made an easy project look, well, easy!

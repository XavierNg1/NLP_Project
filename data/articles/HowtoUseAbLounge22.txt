 Think of doing a crunching motion, bringing your ribs down toward your hips.


Note that although the Ab Lounge 2 directions instruct you to do an abdominal crunch, the resulting jackknife motion--as your hips drop and your legs and upper body come up--happens at your hip joint, not the lumbar spine. Your rectus abdominis muscle doesn't perform hip flexion; your hip flexors do.
 Although your rectus abdominis muscle doesn't perform the primary motion during this exercise, it does work to stabilize your lumbar spine against the pull from your hip flexors.

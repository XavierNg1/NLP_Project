 Your new motto is one shot, one kill. Don't try to do trick shots you will not get many kills and it will get you killed. Find cover and make sure no one can see you.;
, Bolt Action Rifles are great for power, but Semi-Automatics are great for speed. Pick your weapon, and change styles accordingly.
 Shotguns and Sub Machine Guns are excellent for running around with, but Handguns work best if you have a great trigger finger, or a modified controller.
 Your perks should hide you, or make kills easier. Using UAV Jammer\Cold Blooded, and Dead Silence\Ninja Pro is great for moving around, but Stopping Power & Iron Lungs\Steady Aim Pro are excellent for kills. If it doesn't hide you, and it doesn't help your rifle, you don't need it.
 Your secondary weapon should be silenced so you can escape from a building when compromised.
 You never know where enemies might be. If you think an enemy knows your location, remember: it's safer to run than try to kill them.
 You can never be more careful then when playing as an assassin.

 This is a specialized skill that takes a lot of practice and is normally only taught to bona fide locksmiths. The sale of tension pick sets is likewise restricted to people with proper credentials, but with some creativity, you can roughly approximate this tool on your own.
 For weak locks, a pair of paper clips should work; tougher locks might require bobby pins, wire clippers and a pair of pliers. The key is to use metal firm enough for your pick and your tension wrench, the two components of the tool.








Spring steel is the best material to use because it doesn't crack as easily and can be made with a file. You can get these from hacksaw blades. Consider the thickness of the blade because this will restrict the size of the locks that your lock pick will be able to enter.
The tension wrench is made in an “L” shape, and is used to apply tension to the bottom of the lock. You can make this by getting an Allen key and filing it flat.
The pick itself is made with a much shorter leg, like a lowercase “r.” It's used to push pins out of the tumbler so it can rotate.
 Press it in along the bottom of the lock, and apply constant tension on it the whole time as you work with your pick. If you don't it will take longer and you may have to start again.









If you're not entirely certain which direction which way to turn the tension wrench, put it in the lock and turn it one way. Pull out the pick quickly while listening closely to the lock. When you turn in the right direction, you'll actually hear the pins drop.
 Use the leg of the pick to find and push each pin up and out of the tumbler. Once all pins have been moved, the lock should open. As previously noted, this skill takes a lot of practice to master, so have plenty of cheap practice locks on hand if you hope to get good at it.

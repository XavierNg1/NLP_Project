 Add 1-2 tablespoons of coconut oil to a smoothie along with the other ingredients.For example, pour 1 cup of any kind of milk and 1 cup of ice into a blender. Add 1 tablespoon of coconut oil and 1 ripe banana. Blend and serve.


Coconut oil may be solid at room temperature, and blending it into a smoothie might leave small chunks of it. If you don't like this, you can melt the coconut oil at a low temperature first, then slowly add it to the rest of the smoothie ingredients as you blend them., Simply add a small amount of coconut (a spoonful or so, according to your preference) to your drink and stir until it melts.


To get the best texture and taste, some prefer to also add a bit of high-quality unsalted butter and/or sweetener to their coffee or other drink., You can add a bit of coconut oil to many cooked or prepared foods as a way of getting more of it in your diet.You can try stirring a spoonful into soup, yogurt, oatmeal, or pasta. You can also mix it into peanut butter or another spread.
 Melt a few tablespoons of coconut oil and add it to any marinade.Use it as usual for meat, fish, etc.

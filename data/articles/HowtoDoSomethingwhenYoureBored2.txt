 This could be a friend you always speak to, or even a friend that you very rarely speak to.;
, Say that you would rather do a 'What to do when you are bored' video.
 The amount depends on how many you can think of.
 Whether this is an iPad camera, a camera that has a video, or an iPhone, it will work. Make sure you have the apps required to edit it and put them together; there are plenty of apps that can do this on the app store.
 It's always best to get one friend to say what the activity is, and then get the other friend to act out doing the activity after the first friends has said it, by recording two separate videos.
 Remember, there are plenty you can download and try out, and if you don't like it or it's not what you thought it was, delete it and find another one.
 If you don't like it, record the parts that you weren't quite happy with, or start over again. If you are happy with it, post it on a social media site like Facebook, Google+, YouTube or Twitter, or even Instagram, and show off to your other friends what you can do.
 It'll remind you of all the great things you could be doing instead of being bored!

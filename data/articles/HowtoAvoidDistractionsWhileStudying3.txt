 If the books and seriousness of the library put you in the mood for focusing on Trigonometry, go for it. If the comfy chairs and coffee at your local cafe are what you need to get through your reading for English, go there. The most important thing is that the location motivates you to study.Most people like a place that is neither too cold nor too warm.
A study space shouldn’t be loud. Some people prefer a place that is absolutely quiet, others like a little background noise.
If you are often distracted by studying, choose a seat that faces a wall rather than a window, hallway, or other seats.
 Put a sign on your door that lets others know you’re studying. This will keep them from distracting you.You can also message your friends, tell them when you’re studying, and ask them not to disturb you during that time.
 Studies about whether or not music helps you focus when studying are mixed. If you feel like listening to music keeps you energized and focused on studying, you can use it. Keep a couple things in mind, however:The music should be fairly quiet.
Choose music that has no words so you’ll be less likely to become distracted.
Consider listening to “white noise” tracks for background noise instead of music.

 Start FrameMaker and then on the File menu, click Open and browse and open the FrameMaker document for which you wish to generate a table of contents .;
, This text should ideally be the headings and sub-headings in your FrameMaker document.
 Once you have identified the headings and sub-headings in your document, assign an appropriate paragraph tag to them. For example, the document title should be assigned the paragraph tag Heading1, the sub-heading should be assigned the tag Heading 2, and so on.
 On the Special menu, click Table of Contents. When prompted, click Yes to specify that you want to create a stand-alone table of contents . This would create the table of contents as a separate file in the same folder as the source document. The Set Up Table of Contents dialog box appears.
 In the Set Up Table of Contents dialog box, select the paragraph tags that you want to include in the table of contents from the Don’t Include list and using the upper arrow button move them to the Include Paragraphs Tagged list. Similarly, select the paragraph tags that you do not want to include in the table of contents from the Include Paragraphs Tagged list and using the lower arrow button move them to the Don’t Include list. Note that you should typically include the paragraph tags for the first two or three heading levels in your document.
 If you want every entry in the table of contents to be linked to its source in the document, then select Create Hypertext Links and click Set to apply the changes and generate the table of contents .
 You can format the entries in the table of contents , by creating paragraph tags; as you would for a FrameMaker document.
 At times, you might need to update your FrameMaker document and reflect the changes to your table of contents as well. You can repeat the steps 2 to 6 to generate the updated table of contents for your FrameMaker document.

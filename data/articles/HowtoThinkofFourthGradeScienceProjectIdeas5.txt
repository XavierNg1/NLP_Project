 Consider where you are constructing your project. If you are constructing it in the classroom, think about what materials are available to you in your classroom. If you are constructing it outside or in the gym, consider the materials that are available to you at there. Make a list ahead of time and bring any needed materials with you.Ask other teachers for help locating materials for your project.
 Limit your options to things that you can achieve in the amount of time that is available. Some projects take hours to complete. Other projects could take days or weeks to complete. If you are creating a complicated project that takes weeks to complete, be sure to pace yourself to ensure that you have enough time and your students follow along., There are many variables that can affect your science project. You should take these variables into consideration when you are selecting a project. Decide which variables you can control and which ones you cannot.


For example, do not select a project that requires you to mix colored lights if you donâ€™t have the ability to turn the lights off where your project will be displayed.

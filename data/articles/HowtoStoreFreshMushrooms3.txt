 If you don't plan to use your fresh mushrooms within a week or so, you'll want to freeze them to preserve them. Start by rinsing the mushrooms under water and then letting them dry in open air. You can spread them on a paper or tea towel to catch the excess water., Once the mushrooms are relatively dry, brush them with a paper towel or mushroom brush. This gets some of the more stubborn dirt off of them., Slice your mushrooms into even pieces before you sauté them. Using an egg slicer can give you uniform pieces. Sauté them in one to two tablespoons of olive oil with some salt and pepper to taste., Once you’ve finished cooking the mushrooms, let them cool before you freeze them. Spread them out on a cookie sheet in a single layer until they are cool to the touch.
 Once the mushrooms have cooled, store them in resealable plastic bags and freeze them. Cooking before freezing them prevents them from absorbing too much moisture when they defrost.

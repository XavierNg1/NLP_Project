 This should be a small weapon, like the recon with no barrel extension, or the firefly. Make sure that you can run at a good pace with it and that it doesn't get in the way of you hands when you're reviving someone.;
, Your secondary is a backup for when you need to shoot one-handed while reviving someone. This weapon should be one you're comfortable with.
 This really only needs to be some chewable candy to "revive" someone. Have some water and band-aids etc. in your bag too in case someone actually gets hurt for real.
 A medic needs to be able to run to a downed teammate quickly, and then needs to be able to get out quick as well. Make sure you can move fast over and around obstacles.
 Because you'll be running 50% of the time as a medic, that means 50% of the darts that will be coming at you will be when you're running. If you can dodge darts when running this means sprints are less dangerous.
 Get a system down where you can revive them in under ten seconds. Having your pistol out while reviving also helps, so you can fend off enemies who want to take you down.
 If you get downed, then the other medic on your team will have to revive you or your team will be without a medic. Don't get involved in heavy conflict without having some more troops with you.

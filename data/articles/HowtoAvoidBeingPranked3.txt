 Changing the passwords on your phone, computer, and tablet can prevent people from getting into them and messing with your settings or posting to your social media accounts. You should consider doing this especially if your friends are likely to know what your password might be, like a pet’s name or the street you grew up on., If something – a news story, an offer from a friend, or a situation like “$100 gift cards in the break room!” – seems too good to be true, it probably is! Make sure you follow up on these types of instances. See if other news sites have the same story, or check with friends and coworkers to see what they've heard and if it matches what you know. Some of your friends might be in on the prank, but not everyone will be!Avoid news sites that are notorious for doing things like this, especially around April Fool’s Day. Google usually pulls an April Fool’s Day prank, as does the Village Voice. The British press in general also loves a good prank at the beginning of April, so take news from these sources with a grain of salt!, This suggestion is probably the hardest to follow through on, but the easiest way to avoid getting pranked on the internet is to spend less time there! Instead you could read a book or magazine or even watch the news on TV. Giving people fewer opportunities to prank you helps you to avoid getting pranked!

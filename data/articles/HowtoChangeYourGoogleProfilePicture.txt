Choosing photos from Google Plus. For this, click on either "Your photos" or "Photos of you". These tabs will give you photos you have shared on Google Plus or saved to Google, OR photos you have been tagged in.
Take a picture. For this, click on the tab "Web camera". This will only work if you have a web camera, so make sure you have one before clicking on this tab. This tab allows you to take a picture using your web camera right there on the spot.

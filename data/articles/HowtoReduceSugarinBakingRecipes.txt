 Start by cutting back to three-quarters the amount the recipe suggests. Then halve it. Many French chefs halve the amount of sugar recommended in a baked goods recipe with nobody the wiser as to the flavour impact. With a gradual reduction, you'll find yourself getting used to the new way that the baked items taste.;
, Another great way to reduce sugar intake is to substitute it with something as tasty. Some choices include:


Stevia

Spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, mixed spice, etc.)
Fruit puree (but beware, this is still fructose, and see "Tips")
Syrups, such as maple, rice or agave (agave syrup is very high in fructose and may not be a suitable substitute)
Honey
Artificial sweeteners (you'll need to know if they can be baked though)
Fresh fruit, berries, or sweet vegetables.
 Use this to make up the missed volume of sugar. For most recipes this will work but you do need to experiment.
 Yeast requires the sugar to activate. If you can discern how much sugar the yeast needs and set that aside and only fiddle with the rest of the sugar, that's ideal. If not, experiment with daring, and you'll discover by trial and error what does and does not work.
 Icing sugar, granular sugar, fine sugar, etc., are all still sugar and adding them to your freshly baked goods can increase the sugar overload. Find topping substitutes that are healthy, such as fresh fruit, spices like cinnamon, or sugar-free grated chocolate. Or why not just leave it bare?

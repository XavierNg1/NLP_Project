 You will not be able to do enough slashes in a row to kill it without being grabbed. So instead, slash it once or twice and then run away or run behind it and start slashing.;
, This is another important skill. At full health in narrow hallways and corridors, try to get past a zombie without being grabbed or using a weapon. The best thing to do is approach it, and step back or to the side when it lurches toward you. It won't be able to move again for a second or two.
 Dogs would be the next step. Then, bigger things, like Hunters, Lickers and bosses. Yes, almost on all the bosses you can use a gun or either a knife. Most bosses are big and slow.

 Lay a large trash bag flat on the table. Bags meant for outdoor use are ideal because they are made of thicker material. Use a soft tip marker to make the first mark a few inches below the top, along the left edge of the bag. The edge of the bag will become the center of the kite.


The trash bag you use needs to be at least 40 inches (100 cm) long for this kite.
Depending on the color of the trash bag, make sure the marker you use is visible. For example, with a black trash bag a silver marker would work best.
 Using a yardstick or tape measure, measure 10 inches (25 cm) down the edge of the bag. Then measure 20 inches (50 cm) across, which should be somewhere in the middle of the bag. Make a mark here for the side corners., From the top point, measure 40 inches (100 cm) down on the edge of the bag and make a mark. The three points should now form a triangle on the bag, with the side corner mark being closer to the top mark.


If you only have trash bags that are smaller than the given measurements, just make sure your points are proportional. The mark for the side corner should measure half of the total length, so that when the bag is unfolded the length and width are the same.
For example, the horizontal span could be measured at 10 inches (25 cm) and the length could be 20 inches (50 cm). As long as the proportions match, a smaller kite is fine.
 Using the yardstick or another straight edge as a guide, connect the top point to the side corner point and the side corner point to the bottom point. Your line doesn’t have to be perfectly straight, but as close as possible.
 Use sharp scissors or a box knife and cut as straight as you can along the lines. If you are going to use a box knife, you’ll want to put a large piece of cardboard under the material before you cut it out.


Save the extra material after you cut the kite shape out. This will be used later.
After you cut the kite out, unfold the diamond shape and lay it flat on the table.

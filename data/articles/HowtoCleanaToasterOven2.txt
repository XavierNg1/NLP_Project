 Spray a scrubber sponge with a nontoxic all-purpose cleaner. Wipe the sides and bottom of the inside of the toaster oven. Do not wipe down the heating elements (typically located at the back of the toaster oven) with your sponge.Do not spray the inside of the toaster oven directly.
 If you’re having a hard time removing a grease stain or baked-on food, make a paste by mixing three tablespoons baking soda with one tablespoon ammonia. Coat the scrubber side of your sponge with the paste, then move your hand firmly in a circular or zigzag motion on and around the area you’re trying to clean.You can make a similar paste by mixing one tablespoon lemon juice with two tablespoons cream of tartar.
This strategy also works well on steel grates or mesh inside the oven.
 Moisten a dishcloth and wring it out so it is damp, but not dripping. Sprinkle some baking soda on the cloth. Use this treatment to wipe down greasy surfaces inside the toaster oven or on the drip pan., If you encounter food that has charred into a black or brown mess on the sides of bottom of the toaster oven, use a nylon scrubber dipped in soapy water to remove it. Do not allow the water to drip within the toaster oven., Use a dishcloth to clean the heating element. If any unwanted material has accumulated on the heating element itself, you can use a mixture of one tablespoon baking soda and one tablespoon water to make a paste. Apply the paste to the heating element and scrub it gently using a toothbrush or dishcloth.Do not scour or vigorously scrub the heating element.
Make sure that if you apply paste to the heating element that you scrub it clean before using the toaster oven again, or leftover residue will burn.

 Take a clean plastic container and place it on the countertop in your kitchen. Make sure the container is sturdy enough to withstand the extreme temperature of boiling water. Fill the container with one cup of boiling water, and then add one-fourth teaspoon of sea salt. Let the mixture cool until it is still quite warm., After your sea salt solution has cooled to a very warm temperature, dip two cotton balls in the solution. The cotton balls should become completely saturated with the sea salt solution., Place one cotton ball on each end of your piercing. Allow the sea salt solution to soak into the area surrounding the piercing. Soak the piercing with the cotton balls for about five minutes.Exchange the cotton balls for freshly soaked ones every minute or so during the soak.
 After you have soaked your bridge piercing for around five minutes, remove the final set of cotton balls and toss them in the trash. Allow the piercing to air dry completely. Make sure you donâ€™t touch the piercing while it is drying!, You should only use a sea salt soak to clean your bridge or earl piercing. Avoid using antibacterial soaps or other antibacterial products on the piercing. Antibacterial soap might dry out the piercing, and this can potentially increase the time it takes your piercing to heal.

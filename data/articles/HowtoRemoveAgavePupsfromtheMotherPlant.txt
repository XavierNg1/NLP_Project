 Depending on the variety of agave you have, you may wish to don a pair of gardening gloves to keep from getting pricked by thorns, if present, on the leaves.


Remove the plants from the pot. Do this carefully so you do not injure the plants. Tip the pot on its side, allowing its contents to come out. You may need to squeeze or push on the sides of the pot a little if it is a flexible pot. For ceramic or other hard pots, you can get the dirt and root ball out easier by running a trowel between the dirt and the pot to loosen the dirt from the sides of the pot.
Dig up agave sets that are in the ground. Use a shovel and dig around the plants, leaving a generous amount of space to keep from severing the roots. Some of the mother plants can be quite large. In the event the group of plants is too extensive to dig up, loosen the dirt with your shovel around the plants you wish to remove and proceed with the steps to remove agave pups.;
, Break the dirt apart with your hands or with your trowel. You may wish to wear gardening gloves for this step.
 This action will loosen the pup from the mother plant and allow it to be easily removed.
 The plants should separate easily so you will not need to use much force. Pulling aggressively will compromise the strength and structure of the small plant, harming it so it does not grow.
 The pup will need its roots to grow. The mother plant can withstand minor root damage but the pup will need the roots to survive the trauma of bring transplanted.

 You can actually make your own Creme Eggs at home. Not only are they fun to make, but you can also experiment with different recipes and spices if you want to customize the taste.


Homemade Creme Eggs are a great Easter activity for kids, who can help with coloring the filling, assembling the egg filling, and covering the filling in chocolate.
 Just in case Creme Eggs weren't decadent enough, you can also batter and deep fry them to transform them into a warm, crunchy, gooey dessert.


Make sure you use fresh oil to prevent the eggs from tasting like fish, fries, or other foods.
 Brownies, pies, cakes, and cupcakes will never be the same again after you add Creme Eggs to the mix. These treats are perfect for single-serve desserts like croissants and cupcakes, but you can also bake entire eggs right into cakes, squares, and other treats.


When you make cupcakes, place a whole Creme Egg or Creme Mini Egg in the center of each cupcake after you pour the batter.
For brownies, cakes, and squares, pour the batter and use your eye to divide the brownie into individual portions. Then, place a whole Creme Egg or Creme Mini Egg at the center of each portion before baking.
For croissants, roll a whole Creme Egg or Creme Mini Egg up inside each pastry before baking.
 Crushed Creme Eggs make a delightful topping for desserts and treats. Freeze four or five Creme Eggs for a couple hours, until they're frozen through. Remove the foil and transfer the frozen eggs to a sealable plastic bag. Use a rolling pin or hammer to crush the eggs into small chunks. Sprinkle the chunks onto your favorite desserts, such as:


Cakes, cheese cakes, and ice cream cakes
Ice cream cones and sundaes
Milk shakes
Pancakes and waffles
Sweet sandwiches, such as peanut butter and jam or chocolate-hazelnut spread sandwiches

 In order to reach your full potential as a singer, you need to practice singing every day. Singers are like athletes, and the more you sing, the stronger your vocal cords will get. Also, the more comfortable you get singing, the better you will be when it’s time to perform in public.Try your best during your practice sessions. If you practice things incorrectly, they will become habits and bad habits are hard to break.
Keep a practice journal to help keep track of what you’re working on.
Write down what you’re doing well and what still needs improvement.
 The way people sound in their heads is completely different from the way they sound to others. Record your practice sessions, then listen to the recordings and analyze them.Listen for notes that are out of tune or places where you sound off key.
Check to see how your voice sounds – does it sound pitchy, like you’re running out of breath?
Once you have made your observations, set new goals of how to improve and try to execute on those goals.
 You may be familiar with singing in the shower, but for singers, humming is actually more effective. Humming will cause your vocal cords to stretch thinner, improving flexibility and expanding your vocal range.Close your mouth and make an “mmm” sound while pretending you have gum in your mouth.
Hum scales or your favorite song.
 A singer’s voice is only part of the package – singers also have to be very strong performers. Singing in front of a mirror will help you gauge how your movements look, judge how well you're emoting and decide how believable you look when you’re performing in character.If you’re performing for musical theater, remember to perform in a heightened manner.
Practice what you’re going to say in between songs, or as you’re introducing yourself.
Use the mirror to see if there are any points where you look scared, or like you’re thinking about what comes next.

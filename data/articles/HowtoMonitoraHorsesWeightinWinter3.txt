 If you are unsure if your horse's weight loss is of concern or you are unsure how to help your horse gain weight, you should get some professional advice. Talk to your veterinarian about what and how much you should be feeding your horse to fatten it up.Your veterinarian will also be able to recommend further bloodwork and diagnostics if they suspect that something else, such as parasites or disease, may be causing your horse’s weight loss.
Weight loss, if at all, should be gradual. Contact your veterinarian immediately if you notice extreme changes in your horse’s weight over a short period of time.
 If your horse has lost too much weight it can be an emergency that requires immediate veterinary care. Assess your horse's vital signs. Make sure that it is breathing regularly and that it has a strong pulse. A horse with irregular breathing or a weak pulse, or that is weak and unable to move, is in desperate need of emergency veterinary care.


If any of its vital signs are not strong, you should call a veterinarian immediately.
 Horses should eat 2 - 2.5% of their body weight in good quality bulky foods, such as grass or hay, during winter. For the average 1,000 pound horse, this would mean eating 25 pounds. Make sure that your horse is getting enough. Getting your horse to gain weight requires that you feed it more calories every day than you have been. Discuss making one of the following changes to your horse’s diet with your veterinarian:


Give the horse unrestricted access to hay around the clock.
Change to a higher grade of hay.Add in a complete feed.
Add 4 to 8 ounces of corn or cocosoya oil to a small amount of grain.
Add beet pulp, sweet feed, or concentrates to your horse’s diet.

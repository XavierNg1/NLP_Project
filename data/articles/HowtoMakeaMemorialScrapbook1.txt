 You may want to choose a scrapbook in the person's favorite color, or in a classic white. Buy scrapbook pages in a neutral color, such as cream.

Scrapbooks commonly come in 6 by 6, 8 by 8, 8.5 by 11 and 12 by 12 sizes. If you are planning a comprehensive book that includes more than pictures, you should choose either 8.5 by 11 or 12 by 12. You can buy a pack of pages that can be inserted into the scrapbook as needed.;
, Ask for contributions from friends and family. Since families often set out pictures during funerals and wakes, you may be able to take these photos and scan them in before or after the service.

It is a good idea to scan all photos that you plan to use into the computer. If you don't have a scanner or computer that can do this, you can ask a friend or get an archival service to do it. Keep the photos on a computer disk and print them anew with a digital printer or at a local photo lab. Then, give the photos back to friends or family so that they can keep them as a part of their photo albums.
 Ask for 100 to 300 words from each person in the form of a letter, note or memory. Give people at least a month to think about this and write from their heart., You can either recopy each person's prose onto your scrapbook pages with a decorative scrapbooking pen. You can also frame each person's note like it is a photo., For example, try to find a wedding announcement, wedding invitation, retirement party invitation, newspaper article that they were featured in, obituary and funeral program., Type up or journal lyrics from their favorite songs., Include quotes from these authors throughout the book., Many stores sell sets of thematic scrapbooking accents, including themes such as mother, father, vacation, wedding and more. These can help to make a scrapbook look professional very quickly., If there were too many to include, make a list of people who gave cards and flowers to be included on a page.

 A scarf can be used to reduce the need for extra layers. It can add warmth and allow you to keep your layering minimal to reduce bulk. As scarfs do not hide your frame, you can go for a chunkier scarf. This can help add warmth, as your clothing will not be as big or chunky. For example, opt for a very long, thick knit scarf to keep you warm.
As a big scarf is eye catching, keep other accessories minimal.
 If your core is still cold, but you're already wearing three layers, accessorize with items like cardigans, vests, and blazers. These items can add warmth without bulk.Make sure to go for lighter varieties to avoid adding bulk. A slim cotton cardigan, for example, is a better option than a big, chunky knit one.
Blazers and vests may pull your other clothing in slightly, creating a slimming effect. They are a good option if you feel your outfit is looking a little bulky.
 If you feel your clothing is making you look puffy around the middle, use a scarf. Wearing a belt around your waist can constrict your layers in a way that highlights your figure. It's a great, stylish way to cut down on bulk when layering., If your feet get cold, try wearing knee-high socks. This can also be great if you want to add color. If most of your outfit is a neutral color, like gray or black, something like blue or red socks can add a little color.You can also add patterns with socks. Consider striped or polkadot socks.

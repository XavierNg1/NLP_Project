 Since player 2 is second to play, Player 1 must find a way to become 'Player 2' in terms of being able to copy moves. Although many people try to create a mirror top-bottom and left-right, most do it wrong by only mirroring either the top-bottom or the left-right. A true mirror reflects top-bottom and left-right at the same time.
 While mirrors will tend to favor Player 1, if Player 1 only plays either vertical or horizontal lines, Player 2 can win a mirror game with Player 1 by creating 3 chains that are all vertical or horizontal. If Player 1 notices that he is being copied, he can create a loop around the center box which will favor Player 1 instead of Player 2.
 While most might think this automatically spells doom for Player 2 if they let it happen, it does not. There are two strategies against this:

, In the event that they seem to be forcing you to take it, make sure there are un-copied lines somewhere else one the board. Also, try to circle around the center block, incorporating it into a waving chain that counts as "1" so that if they mirror you the rest of the way, the count will remain odd.
 Since you are already 1 box ahead, if you share all the remaining boxes evenly, you will win. So eventually Player 1 will see that copying you will cause them to lose and they will stop.
 Thus, when you play people with it, you might get some extremely negative responses from people who like to appreciate skillful play.

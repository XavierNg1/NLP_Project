 This tool allows you to activate your Sprint phone for Boost Mobile.
, You’ll be instructed to enter the ESN for your Sprint phone, as well as your mobile number and PIN if you’re an existing Boost Mobile customer. The ESN is normally located on a sticker inside the battery compartment or on the back of your phone. If you are a new Boost customer, you may be charged a $10 activation fee to use your Sprint phone on a new Boost account.
 This can take several hours or days, depending on the nature of your request and on the status of your account.


Check your phone activation status any time online by visiting https://activate.boostmobile.com/primary/_NtYJoS-iizh9mDi and entering your account PIN, confirmation number, and ESN.

,, Always do a good job when babysitting and then when the parents return say, "I enjoyed babysitting your kid tonight and I hope to do it again. If anyone you know is in need of a good babysitter, feel free to give them my name and number"

, Hand it out to people you meet that have young children who are NOT strangers and who you have talked with. Handing out a business card to people you have just met can scare them off or make them feel uncomfortable.
 This gives the impression that you are a kind person who has an interest in their lives.
 Tell the parents who you are, why you enjoy babysitting, when you're available, what fun activities you will do with the kid, and more.
 Be sure to invite young kids you can babysit, as well as their parents. At the party you can demonstrate how responsible you are as well as your other skills. Make sure you leave a positive impression with the kids. Parents will usually just bring up babysitting if not, mention that if they ever have anything to attend you will be more than happy to babysit before they leave.So there for they can't get harmed and that is what you want!

,, The parents will get the impression that you like children. Be nice to the parents too.
 If the parents get home and they are still awake, they will not be impressed, and most likely won't hire you again.
 If they say the kids have homework to do, make sure they do their homework. If they need dinner, make dinner. And so on.
 Even clean up messes that were there when you got there, it makes a good impression on the parents. Put things back in the right places though!

 Your t-shirt may get stretched out in the mask-making process but you should be able to wear it again.;
, Your arms should not go into the t-shirt. Slide your t-shirt neckline down so that the neckline rests above your eyebrows and on the bridge of your nose.
 This will give your mask a more streamlined look. Folding the collar also covers the shirt tag.
 Tie them tightly so that the knot does not come loose later.
 If you are planning on wearing a full ninja costume, tuck the rest of the t-shirt into the shirt of your ninja costume.

 If the dog has injured their spine, it is especially important that you carry them on a firm, stiff surface. Evidence of a spine injury include immobility or wobbliness in the rear legs, unconsciousness, differently-sized pupils, partial or complete paralysis, or blood flowing from the dog’s orifices.There are many options for flat surfaces to use as stretchers. Aside from a board, you can use a sled, table leaf, bookshelf, ironing board, or even a window screen.Make sure the dog lays on its side, and that its body is not twisted while moving it carefully onto the stretcher. Have someone help you carefully move them onto the stretcher, if possible.
 Position the head of an unconscious dog in normal alignment with the dog’s body. With the dog on its side, this means the snout should be pointed forward or a bit downward. This is important to maintain both airflow to the lungs and blood flow to the brain. If the dog has vomited, position the head slightly downward, to allow vomit to easily vacate the dog’s mouth.Be aware the a dog that has suffered a head injury is likely to vomit, even if they are unconscious.
 If the dog’s limb is clearly broken, wrap it in something clean, such as gauze or a towel and tape it in place. The goal is reducing movement of the leg. As you move the dog, make sure to support the entire limb, so that it cannot bend at the point where it was broken or fractured.Do not attempt to push broken bones back into place.
 If the dog bleeds continuously for more than five minutes, you need to take steps to control the bleeding. First, apply pressure with a clean material, ideally a padded bandage or gauze. This will at least slow the loss of blood. If you have wrap and/or tape, wrap a bleeding wound with tension equal to gently pressing on the wound.

 Shiveer. That is an ice dragon's home.
 Ice dragons can heal themselves and sometimes that gets people to back off.
 Then say *blasts with ice no nothing no dodge no miss*. Then they will try to say *heals self kills dragon no nothing*. Just say *heals* and repeat!

, If they say "stop what you are doing" then stop and say sorry. It's better to say sorry than get reported.

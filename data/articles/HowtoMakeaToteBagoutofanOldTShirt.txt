 You need to remove the sleeves of the shirt with a pair of good scissors. Remember to cut through both layers of shirt. Cut just below the shoulder seams. These will be the straps. If you started with a tank top, skip this step.;
, Lay a dinner plate across the opening of the T-shirt. It should be half on and half off. Trace around the plate with a pen.
 You should cut along the curved line as neat as possible. Make sure the shirt is still inside out. This will be the opening.
 Make it as straight as possible. It needs to be an inch above because this will eventually become the bottom.
 This is the bottom of the tote bag. Make sure to sew directly across the bottom line. Go over it again once or twice to make sure the seam is nice and strong.
 You now have a stylish tote bag! You can use it to carry around school books, work materials, or anything.

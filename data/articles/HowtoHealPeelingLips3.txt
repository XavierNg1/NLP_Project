 Scrubs and balms that include lemon juice or other citric ingredients can irritate your skin and lips. They also cause sun sensitivity that may lead to rashes or blistering.They probably do more harm than good when it comes to healing peeling lips.
 Your lips are more sensitive than your skin. Even products intended for lip use may cause damage to damaged lips.Better to stick with gentle exfoliants instead of something like a facial scrub.

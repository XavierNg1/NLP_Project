 Newborn puppies are unable to urinate or have bowel movements on their own. Normally, the mother dogâ€™s grooming and licking of the anal area activates this. With orphaned puppies, you must stimulate them. Simply moisten a cotton ball with warm water, and gently rub the genital area for 1-2 minutes.Puppies should urinate/defecate on the cotton ball.
 If the puppy does urinate or defecate, most of it should be absorbed by the cotton ball. However, you should keep some paper towels nearby to clean up any additional mess., Some puppies will respond best to this prior to feeding, and others will do better after feeding. In order to ensure that all puppies are going potty, you should repeat this procedure before and after each feeding.Newborn puppies will need to eat around every 2 hours.
 It usually takes about three weeks for puppies to be able to urinate and defecate on their own. Keep stimulating them for around 21 days.

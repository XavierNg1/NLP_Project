 For hard surfaces like floors, countertops, tables, and so on, acetone is once again a great first move. Apply acetone to the tip of a cotton swab and rub it onto the glued area. The acetone will soften the glue — you may even be able to rub it off with a rag afterward.


Be careful when using acetone on painted surfaces. Acetone is a common ingredient in many paint thinners and solvents, so it can dissolve paint on contact. This isn't a big deal if you're willing to re-paint, but if not, you may want to think twice.
 For glue that won't come off with simple application of acetone, you may need to use mechanical action to get the glue off. Hard, flat metal or hard plastic tools like putty knives, butter knives, and so on are your best bet. Scrape at a diagonal angle with firm pressure to chip the hardened crazy glue away.


Be careful not to scratch or gouge your surface when getting the glue off. Push your tool in the direction of the surface, not down into it.
 When all else fails, a fine-grit sandpaper can help you remove crazy glue and get your surface smooth again. Stop and check your work frequently while sanding — you don't want to accidentally sand past the dried-on glue and wear away at the surface underneath.


For big jobs, wear a dust mask to ensure you don't breathe any particles kicked up by your sanding.

 Measure out the cayenne pepper, chili powder, and paprika. Place all three spices in a small bowl and toss gently to combine them into an even blend.


You can increase or decrease the amount of spice you use to alter the amount of heat these Cheetos have.;
, Open the bag of Cheetos and dump the spice blend in. Fold the open top down, then give the bag a good shake for 10 to 15 seconds.


Alternatively, you can dump the bag of Cheetos into a medium mixing bowl and toss the spice blend on top of them. Toss gently with a set of salad tongs or a spoon to help coat the chips. Avoid using your hands more than necessary, though, since the spices may stick to your fingers.
 Open the bag again and eat the Cheetos as usual. Most of the spices should cling to the powdered cheese coating, giving it a spicy kick of flavor.


This method is quick and mostly effective, but you should note that the spices will not cling to the Cheetos as evenly or permanently as they would with a more complex methods since there is no ingredient specifically binding them to the chips.

 Opening up your body to the other person tells them you are listening, engaged, and ready to communicate. It also makes eye contact easier and more natural to maintain. Position yourself a few feet away from the other person's face;
, Most commonly, this is one of the other people's eyes, but if your are uncomfortable you can look between their eyes, just under or above the eye, or at the earlobe.
 Think of how you would look at a painting or great view -- you are not focusing intently on their eye but instead looking at them gently. Hold your eyes in this position and resist darting them around. Relax your gaze by breathing slowly as you make eye-contact and nodding occasionally while you listen.
 Too much eye-contact can be as off-putting as none at all. While you don't need to count the seconds, you should look away every once in a while to keep the conversation light and easy, but only for a few seconds. Some casual ways to do so include:


Laughing, nodding, and acknowledging the other person.
Looking at the sky/weather
Looking off to the side briefly, as if remembering something.
Running your hands through your hair.

 You might want to do a little research on different types of art. This will help when deciphering the illustration needs for your book. Also, ask yourself what time period does this range from. Time periods are very important when it comes to matching illustrations to the book,itself. If the setting is in some greater time period, you might want to research art in that period for readers to see the mood for the book.;
, Ponder about these three exceptional drawings. After all, they are going to be in your book. Remember: You are just seeking the type of art; these are not the drawing themselves!

, If you are going to draw them yourself, please do not put pressure on yourself when you mess up a drawing. Drawings take time. Even the famous painters and sketchers made mistakes on their artwork. Once your beautiful masterpiece is finished being sketched, you should probably find a way to color it. Use vibrant colors that will catch the reader's attention if the book is in a fairytale or happy setting. If it is in a mysterious setting, like Sherlock Holmes, I would not suggest coloring your artwork at all.
 This means you should look for the specific kinds of artist. Remember: Some artist specialize in specific kinds of art. For example, if the artist mostly does pastels, that artist specializes in pastels. Since you looked for the kind of art you want, you should know what kind of artist you need. When looking for an artist, look for their creations to see how professional they are at their job.
 If they are, tell them exactly what you want. Be descriptive! You might have to pay them for this ,too.

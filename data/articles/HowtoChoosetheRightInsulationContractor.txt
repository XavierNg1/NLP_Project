 Make sure the contractor you are hiring has a current license to perform work in the state and is insured to state regulations.;
, Pick a contractor that has been in business for a respectable number of years. There are contractors who have been around for over 35 years and you just can't beat experience. There are so many choices: fiberglass batt insulation, blown-in loose fill insulation, and even spray foam insulation. The guy with the right amount of experience will help you make the best choice for your home.
 Check their certification. If an insulation contractor has their installers trained directly by the manufacturer to install their product, then you can be willing to bet that they have the support of the manufacturer during all phases of an installation. This is like extra insurance.
 See if they have a fleet of vehicles or not. It is important that your insulation contractor has more than one truck on the road, especially if you are installing spray foam insulation. In the event that there is an equipment breakdown on a job site, the contractor that has a multi-vehicle fleet can send a new rig to the job site immediately.
 Spray foam installation is a complex process involving many steps and elaborate equipment. If a contractor staffs an equipment specialist they are continuously maintaining the integrity of their equipment, thus ensuring that your job gets done promptly and efficiently.
 Look for insulation contractors who maintain an online presence and read through their testimonials. Also, ask your friends! Maybe they can help by giving you a referral of someone they know and trust.

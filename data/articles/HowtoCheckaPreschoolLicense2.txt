Visit the NCCIC website featured in the Sources section of this article, then click on the name of your state or region. You will then be taken directly to the contact information for your state's child care licensing bureau.
Click on the link for the department of your state's child care website. You will then be redirected to the child care licensing page for your state.
 Some websites will provide you with a direct link to the preschool license search; whereas other websites may require you to search for the link.


If applicable, enter keywords such as "license check" into the search bar embedded onto the website or search in sidebars for a link that will direct you to the license check tool.
In some cases, the website may only have a tool that allows you to view preschools with active, valid child care licenses instead of tools that allow you to search for the names of specific licensed preschools.
 The information required by the license check tool on each state's website may differ. In most cases you will be prompted for the pre-school's name; whereas other websites may require you to provide the pre-school's address, or indicate specific services offered by the preschool.


Review the information for the preschool license that displays in the search results. You will be able to view the current license status and details regarding the license expiration date and if any complaints have ever been filed with the state against the preschool.
If your state's child care website does not contain a tool from which to check licenses, locate the "Contact Us" link and call the licensing agency directly to check the status of a preschool license.

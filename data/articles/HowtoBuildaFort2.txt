 Clear space for your fort and then put two wide and short bookshelves in a position so that the shelves are facing each other. Now stick an old mattress, foam, blanket pile, or other soft surface on the floor between the bookshelves. You can make a roof by putting a piece of plywood, a sheet, or other material over the two bookshelves if you want a roof.
 Remember to start by clearing some space for your fort. You probably want to build it somewhere near a couch so you donâ€™t have to move too much furniture. A love seat will generally work best.


Place a table just a few feet away from the front of the couch so that the long sides are parallel. A dining table of any size will work, but usually, a rectangular, 4-seater works best.
Grab the cushions off of the couch place them on the floor, between or under the couch and table. If you can take the back cushions off as well, do that too.
Take a large sheet and place one long edge along the back of the couch and pin it in place. Drape the remainder of the sheet over the table. Hold the sheet down by placing heavy objects on top of it such as books. Take more sheets as necessary to add sides, or cover the front section of the table. Weigh down these sheets as well.
 This fort is super simple and takes advantage of the softness of your bed to play in. All you need to do is pin a light sheet to the ceiling above your bed. Put one pin at the base of your bed and one pin at the head of your bed. Now climb on the bed and tuck the sheet behind the sides of your bed. Climb under the sheet and you should have a fort inside your bed!

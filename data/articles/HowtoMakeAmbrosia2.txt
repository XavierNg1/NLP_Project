 You are welcome to add a variety of fresh fruit to your ambrosia salad. To prep this fruit, wash it, slice it into bite sized pieces, and then set it to the side. Popular options include:


1 cup green grapes
1 cup seedless red grapes
1 medium banana
1 apple

, Scoop Â¾ cup vanilla yogurt into a medium sized mixing bowl. Add the fruit to the bowl and fold it into the yogurt. Add the marshmallows and coconut flakes to the bowl and fold them into the yogurt.


If your ambrosia salad looks dry, add more yogurt.
 Place a lid over the ambrosia salad and put it in the refrigerator. Allow the dish to chill for approximately 30 then serve.


Instead of covering the dish with a lid, use saran wrap or aluminum foil.

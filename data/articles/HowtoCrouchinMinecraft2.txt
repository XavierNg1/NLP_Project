 Sneaking is a relatively new feature for Minecraft PE (Version 0.12.1), so you'll need to have the latest updates to access it:


Android - Open the Google Play Store and search for "Minecraft Pocket Edition." If the page has an "Update" button, tap it to download and install any updates. If it just has an "Open" button, Minecraft PE is up to date.
iOS - Open the App Store and tap the "Updates" tab at the bottom. Find Minecraft Pocket Edition in the list of apps and tap the "Update" button. If you only see an "Open" button, Minecraft PE is up to date.
 You'll find this button in the middle of your movement controls on the bottom-left side of the screen. It will be indented when active. Tap it twice quickly to activate it.
 You'll stay crouched as long as the button is indented. Double-tap it again to toggle normal walking speed again.

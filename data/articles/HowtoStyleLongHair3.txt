 The ponytail is an incredibly versatile hairstyle that looks best with long hair. There are many ways you can wear a ponytail. While this guide describes a basic middle-height ponytail, it can be easily adapted to many other styles.


A high ponytail in long hair is a striking and currently trendy look.A ponytail placed low on the nape of the neck may make you seem mature more down-to-earth.
A side ponytail is a little quirky and a simple method of varying your look dramatically without needing a haircut.
If your hair is especially long and thick, pigtails (two ponytails) may be necessary for keeping it under control. Just keep in mind that this look is mostly associated with children., Grip a section of hair from the back of your head right where it starts to curve and hold it vertically. Use a fine tooth comb and brush this hair downward towards the roots two to three times.This step isn't always necessary. If your hair is curly or otherwise has plenty of natural volume, this step should be skipped.
 Sweep your hair back to where you want it to sit using both hands. Try to get all of it together and add any loose strands that you missed.


If you are making a ponytail for practical reasons, such as to keep hair from your face during sports, be sure to include your bangs.
If your ponytail is purely aesthetic, leaving your bangs out of the ponytail can also look great.
 Use a hair elastic, scrunchie, or a rubber band. Start by pulling all of your ponytail through the hair tie and bring it to where you want the base of your ponytail to be. Then, twist the tie into a figure 8 and pull your hair once more through the new free opening. Do this until the hair tie no longer has slack and your ponytail feels secure when pulled slightly.

 If you are going to paint a background for your border that is different from your wall color, you can choose a light-over-dark or dark-over-light scheme for sponge painting. If you are using your wall color as your border background, choose a lighter or darker color for the border.;
, Alternatively, if you are putting borders in other parts of the room you can measure distance from the floor, doors and windows. Mark the measurements with chalk.
 Use chalk and follow your measurement marks, taking care to ensure that your lines are straight and your measurements are correct.
 This will help to keep your sponge painting within the border area.



A sea sponge or natural sponge gives your sponge painting a more random appearance. For a more uniform sponge painting effect, a synthetic kitchen sponge works fine.
Cut a couple of the sponges into smaller pieces or wedges to use in corners and small spaces.
If you want to sponge in a uniform pattern, cut your sponges into shapes like hearts, circles or triangles. Use cookie cutters or other patterns to make more intricate designs.
Soak the sponges in warm water, then ring out the excess water. If they still retain water, ring them out inside of a dry towel.
 Use a paint brush or sponge paint the background. Allow the background to dry fully before continuing.
 Plastic lids off of disposable containers, cans and aluminum pie plates also work well.
, Apply the paint to a large piece of poster board or paper to see the effect. Adjust the amount of paint on the sponge accordingly until you like the look.



Dip your sponge heavily in the paint and allow the sponge to run out of paint before dipping it again if you want variations in your color.
 Allow the paint to dry completely before removing the painter's tape.

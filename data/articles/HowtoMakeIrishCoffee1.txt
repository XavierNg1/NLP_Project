 Add hot water to a mug. This should heat it up slightly. Let the water sit for a few minutes before dumping out the contents., Once the mug is heated, add your freshly brewed coffee to the mug. Fill the mug up about three quarters of the way full.The fresher the coffee, the better. It's a good idea to brew coffee right before you decide to make Irish coffee.
 Use a spoon to transfer your brown sugar to the coffee. Use the same spoon to mix the sugar until it's completely dissolved., Measure out your whiskey and slowly pour it into your mug. Stir the coffee slightly to blend everything together., When adding your whipped cream, pour it slowly over the back of a spoon. This will ensure the cream stays on top of the coffee. You can now enjoy your Irish coffee.

 Place the flounder on a clean, flat surface. Healthy flounder will be covered with a light film of transparent slime. Rinse the slime off the fish with lightly running cool water.;
, With a small, sharp knife, cut across the fish, through the skin, behind the gills. The knife should reach the bones of the fish, but not cut through them.
 Find the flounder backbone, which runs down the middle of the fish from the gills to the tail. Cut along this line, from the center of the gills to the tail. Follow the backbone while cutting.
 Insert the tip of the knife under the skin, along the backbone. Slice from the gill to the tail, lifting the side of the fish that is coming loose. Keep lifting the fillet as it pulls away from the bone. Continuing cutting until the fillet is separated from the backbone. The flesh should remain attached at the tail.
 Once the top part of the fish has been filleted, make the same incisions under the flesh and next to the backbone, to pull the bottom part of the fish from the bones. Keep the fillets attached to the fish near the tail.
 Slide the knife between the skin and the meat of the fish and gently cut the flesh away from the skin. Hold onto the skin instead of the flesh during this process, as the skin is stronger.
 Perform the same steps of cutting and filleting on the other side of the fish.
 Once separated from the bone and the skin, the flounder has been cleaned and is ready for cooking and preparing. Four fillets should be taken from one average flounder.

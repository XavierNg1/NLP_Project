 Blotting stains as soon as they occur, will prevent the stain from sinking deeper into the fabric of your sofa. Do not rub the stain. Rubbing the stain will cause the stain to spread.If you let the stain dry, it will be much harder to remove.
 Use a soft brush to comb towards the nap of the fabric. This should help lift up any of the material that is on the outer surface of the couch., Use a small amount of solvent-based fabric cleaner. Typically these come as a foam or a spray and don't contain water, which can cause chenille to shrink. Do not saturate your chenille sofa, you just want to cover the area that has the stain.You can purchase solvent based upholstery cleaners at major department stores or online.
Check the label to see if the cleaner is solvent based.
Look for upholstery cleaner that is made specifically for chenille fabrics.
 Put a dab of fabric cleaner on the stain. Do not rub. Continue to dab the stain with a clean rag until it's dry and you've removed all the fabric cleaner from the sofa. Repeat the steps until the stain is removed from your couch.

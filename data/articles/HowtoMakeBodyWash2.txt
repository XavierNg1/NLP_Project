 For this body wash, you will need ½ cup (112.50 milliliters) of coconut milk, ½ cup (112.50 milliliters) of unscented liquid Castile soap, ⅓ cup (75 milliliters) of raw honey, and 7 drops of essential oil. You will also need a container with a tight-fitting lid, such as a bottle, mason jar, or even an old body wash bottle.
 Open your container and pour everything in. If your are using a container with a small mouth, such as a bottle or an old body wash container, then you can put a funnel over the mouth before pouring everything in. The funnel will help guide all of your ingredients into the container and prevent any spills.
 You can use any essential oil that you like. Lavender essential oil blends especially well with coconut and honey.For an even sweeter scent, consider using vanilla essential oil.
 Do this for a few minutes until everything is blended together.
 You can leave the bottle or jar plain, or you can decorate it with labels, twine, and other decorations. Because this body wash is perishable, it is not recommended to distributed as party favors. Here are some decorating ideas:


Print out a label and stick it on the bottle or jar.
Tie a piece of twine or ribbon around the lid of the jar.
Glue gemstones onto the bottle or jar.
Decorate the cork or lid. You can do this by painting the jar lid with acrylic paint. You can also decorate your lid or cork by hot gluing rhinestones and fancy buttons onto it.
 You will have to shake the container each time before you use it, as the ingredients will settle.

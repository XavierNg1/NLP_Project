 Next, remove the papery layers from a few medium-sized onions. Push a wooden skewer into each onion to create a handle. Dip each onion in the candy coating and set it on a sheet of wax paper to dry. The onion will perfectly resemble a delicious red candy apple.


Once they cool, casually offer your friends a “candy apple” and watch their reactions as they bite into the onion.
Make sure you don’t serve this prank food to someone with an onion allergy.
 Drink or pour out the orange juice. Next, pour the cheesy powder insert from the box of macaroni and cheese into your empty bottle. Add water and screw the lid back on. Shake the bottle until there are no cheese lumps in the liquid.Once the bottle is ready, offer it to a friend and watch them gag as they drink it.
Chill the bottle until you’re ready to use it. A warm bottle of orange juice might make your friends suspicious.
 Purchase a package of Oreo cookies and a tube of toothpaste. Next, carefully pull each cookie sandwich apart and scrape out the icing. Squeeze a dollop of toothpaste on one of the cookies and press them back together. When your friend eats a cookie, they will get a disgustingly minty surprise.Place the minty cookies on a plate. Next, offer your friends a cookie and watch them gag as they eat it.
If you have suspicious friends, leave a plate of minty Oreos lying around to tempt them. You may not get to watch them eat it, but you’ll hear about it later.

 For the first-person present tense form of the verb poner, you drop the -er ending and add a "g" to the end of the verb stem. This is the only present tense form of poner that is irregular., For all pronouns other than the first person, poner follows the same conjugation pattern as regular verbs ending in -er. Do not add a "g" to the verb stem like you did with first person.Tú pones (you put)
Él/ella/usted pone (he/she/you put). Remember that objects have a gender in Spanish.
Nosotros/as ponemos (we put)
Vosotros/as ponéis (you all put)
Ellos/ellas/ustedes ponen (they/you all put)

Tú pongas (you put)
Él/ella/usted ponga (he/she/you put)
Nosotros/as pongamos (we put)
Vosotros/as pongáis (you all put)
Ellos/ellas/ustedes pongan (they/you all put)

, Sometimes you need to order or command someone to do something, and this is what the imperative mood is for. Remember to reverse the verb and pronoun, if you include the pronoun in an imperative sentence. Poner is highly irregular in the imperative mood.Pon tú/no pongas tú (you put/don't put)

 This method works best for cylinder-shaped gifts that can be stood upright. Place the gift in the center of the paper so that it is standing. Use a thick and high quality of wrapping paper, so that it can support the weight of the gift., Grab the two opposite corners of wrapping paper and pull them together so that they meet over top of the gift. Then do the same thing with the other two corners. All four corners should meet in the center. Pinch them together with your finger and then using your other hand, squeeze the paper close to the gift., In order to create a more professional and finished look, you can pleat the paper using folds and creases. Rather than have a bunched look over top of the gift, the pleats will give your wrapping a more professional appearance., Once you have folded or bunched the paper at the top of the gift you can tie a ribbon around the paper to hold it in place. Choose a ribbon that matches with the wrapping paper.


Fluff up any excess paper.

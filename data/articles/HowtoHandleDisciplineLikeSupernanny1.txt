 Discuss your disciplining actions with your significant other and all of the people who take care of your kids in your home. Supernanny Jo Frost always tries to ensure both the mother and father are on board with the same teaching method and approach, for consistency's sake. Everyone in the home needs to stick to the same rules and consequences.;
, What exactly these say will depend on your home and family's needs. Make sure these rules are clear cut and and set in stone. Display these rules prominently so your children can see them clearly. If your children can't read yet, explain to them what you mean by each rule. For safety-related rules in particular, illustrate what you mean.


Be realistic. Focus more on safety and danger-related rules than on trivial or minor ones.
 Don't go looking for trouble; keep your focus on your daily routine, but if you spot trouble, tackle it accordingly. Go about your day as normal. Give praise where praise is due, and follow your normal plan until the child shows signs of acting up.

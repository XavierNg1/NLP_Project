 Rubbing mouthwash onto your hands is another simple method for eliminating strong odors. In addition to neutralizing odor-causing compounds, mouthwash can kill the bacteria on your hands that can cause odor. Scented varieties will also lend a minty smell to your hands that can cover up any remaining odor.

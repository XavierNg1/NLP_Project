 The easiest way to protect your files in Windows is to create separate accounts for different users. Any files in a User’s directory is accessible only by that user. Create a Guest login to allow other people to use your computer without giving them access to your personal documents.;
, Select User Accounts to manage the accounts on your computer. Select the Guest account and click the Turn On button. This will enable the guest login, which provides basic functionality such as web browsing, but restricts access to other user’s files and folders.
 Select your account from the user list and click “Create a password”. This will enable you to enter a password that will be required to login to the account when Windows starts.


Administrators can access any account on the machine.

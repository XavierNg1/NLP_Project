 Some guitars are around $1000, or if you're in the market for a Les Paul, $3500. Basically get the best guitar you can afford to get at the time. It makes a difference.;
, They might have to put it under their name if you are under 18.
 Only withdraw the money when you're going to buy the guitar.
 It is very important that you decide the exact make and model and that you stick to it.
 Don't only go to the extremely large ones, but try to find some small, privately owned ones also. Check there for your guitar and start writing down the store name, price, whether it is new or used, and what condition it is in. This should start to get you a good idea of how much it will cost.
 Don't get anxious and buy the first guitar you see. You need to wait it out. After 2 or 3 months, you will find an amazing deal., They will help you decide if it is in good enough condition, and will keep you from buying it on impulse. Don't be afraid to do this more than once. If the guitar is not right for you, keep waiting.
 Guitar stores always mark up prices, and with a little pressure, you can make them bring it down, especially if it is used.

Good things to say:

"Well, I don't really have quite enough right now..."
"I think I saw it cheaper at (insert store)."
"Um... I think I'm going to shop around a little more... maybe find a better deal."
"If you take 100 bucks off the price, I'll take it off your hands right now."

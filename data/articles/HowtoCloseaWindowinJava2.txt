        public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e) {
                // Dispose the window after the close button is clicked.
                dispose();
        }
});

Call System.exit method inside windowClosing method.





frame.addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter() {
        @Override
        public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e) {
                // Terminate the program after the close button is clicked.

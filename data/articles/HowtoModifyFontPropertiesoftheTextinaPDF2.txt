PitStop Pro

, Start the editor and open your PDF file from the File menu. Your PDF will load, and you will be able to start editing the document.
 In Foxit, right-click on the document and select Property List. The Property List windows is where you will be making the changes to the font.
 PDF files are created in blocks of text. Select the text box that you want to change the font of by clicking anywhere on the text. In Foxit, click the Object menu and then select Edit Object.
 A dropdown menu will appear with all of the available fonts. Choose the font that you would like to change the text to.


You can add more fonts by clicking Edit and then selecting Import Fonts. You can choose any font that is installed on your computer., Once you have changed the font, you may find that the words don’t line up as well as they did originally. Use the Font Size, Char Space, and Word Space entries in the Property List window to adjust how your new font appears on the document.

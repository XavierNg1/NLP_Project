 Hold the lip in place around your water source, to ensure that it doesn’t slip off as the balloon begins to take on water weight. If you have any trouble with slippage, use your other hand to support the expanding balloon from below.


The "lip" of the balloon is that thick ring of material which surrounds the balloon's opening, through which water and air can flow.
You should make sure the area around you can handle an accidental water balloon explosion, as even seasoned pros will have their fair share of these. Make sure there are no electronics or non-waterproof valuables nearby.
 Ensure you’ve firmly secured the balloon before turning on that faucet, hose, or spout. Experience will help you determine the speed at which to fill the balloon but opt for a slower pace at first, increasing water flow only as you gain practice with the procedure.









Water balloons are typically smaller than balloons designed to be filled with air or gas mixtures, so keep this is mind if you’re used to dealing with air-based balloons.
If you overfill the balloon, it will let you know by politely exploding on you. If your balloon does indeed burst, take note of the point at which this happens to ensure you don’t fill your next balloon to that point.
 The lip should be pointing up, and the weight of the full balloon should stretch its neck. If the sagging balloon doesn't appear to have enough neck—you'll likely require 2-6 inches—you've likely overfilled your balloon.









The "neck" of the balloon is that slightly elongated section of the balloon where the main body of the balloon meets the lip.
 The lip should come all the way around and underneath your pinching fingers. Exclude your middle finger from this loop.
 Grasp the lip with that finger and thumb.










You should be pulling your thumb and index finger inward, toward the hand that they belong to.

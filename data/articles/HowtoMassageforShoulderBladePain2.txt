 Effleurage is a technique that uses the whole hand to lightly stroke and massage the back. It is best used with other techniques in order to relieve pain. When using effleurage:


Use your hand to lightly stroke the shoulder blade area.
Slowly increase the pressure you apply with your hand.
Make sure to warm the area up (with your hands) as you stroke.
Always move in an upward motion.
Try to cover and warm as much surface area as possible., After you’ve done effleurage, you should use your hands to knead the upper back area. Kneading the upper back in a circular fashion is a trusted massage and will help relieve pain and tense muscles.


Make sure not to pinch the person’s skin with your hands.
Make sure your previous massaging has warmed the person's skin before you start kneading.
Knead for up to five minutes., Stripping the shoulder blade is a great massage technique you can use to relieve muscular stress, tension, and reduce pain. It is also relatively simple and can be done quickly.


Have the person put one of their hands on their lower back. As a result, their shoulder blade should protrude.
Use your hand to pull the shoulder blade up more.
Take your other thumb and apply pressure with it under the shoulder blade.
Repeat up to ten times., Deltoids are the muscles that attach to the back and sides of the shoulders. Massaging the deltoids and the surrounding area is another great way to relieve muscular stress associated with the shoulder blades. This is a massage that you can do to someone relatively quick and with little preparation. Make sure to:


Take your thumb and use it to apply continual pressure on and under the shoulder blade.
Begin near the spine and move your thumb (applying pressure) toward the shoulder blade.
Use this technique up to 10 times.

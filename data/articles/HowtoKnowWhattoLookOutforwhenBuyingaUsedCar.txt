Plug in an OBD2 Scanner (to Read and Understand OBD Codes)

OBD2 Scanners can tell you lots of information about a vehicle that you wouldn't be able to tell by just looking at it.


Take a look around the vehicle:

Look for scratches and dings - you want to notice them before you buy the car - you can even use them to haggle the price of the car down a bit.
Check the tires - low tire life means that you will need to invest another few hundred dollars soon to replace the tires.
Check the windshield for cracks and chips.

Mechanics can also give you an estimate for any needed repairs so that you know how much the car will cost you in total.

 Each piece of bubble wrap will need to be large enough to go right around a plant container and it should also extend above the container about 5 cm / 2 inches. If you have a lot of containers of the same size, it makes sense to cut all the pieces first and then wrap but if your pots differ in size, it can be easier to cut the wrap separately as you fix each container.;
,, Duct tape or packaging tape work well. Alternatively, use garden twine or plant wires to tie the bubble wrap around the container. Check that it is sturdy.
 If you don't your plants risk baking.
 You will find that the plants will respond well to this insulating wrap, which keeps the soil warmer than the winter air surrounding the plants.

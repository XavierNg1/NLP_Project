 If not, turn the pants inside out, undo the hem at the bottoms and smooth out the creases with a steam iron.
 Take a pair of pants that you have, that are the correct length and measure the outside leg, including the waistband., Make a chalk mark across the pants and transfer the mark all round the bottom. You now have a chalk mark that is the correct length all round the bottom., If the fabric is prone to fraying, rolling, or unraveling, you might want to machine-stitch a row of zigzag stitching around the very end. Cutting a woven fabric with pinking shears can also help to prevent fraying., If you don't have a machine, pin the wonderweb every two or three inches all the way round., You should now see the leg with the chalk mark all round the bottom plus the inch and a half allowance. Bend the leg in so that the chalk mark is on the edge. Make certain that all is smooth and flat inside. Be careful of the pins if you used them., This melts the glue. Remove the pins if used and press lightly again to remove any little marks and you're done.,

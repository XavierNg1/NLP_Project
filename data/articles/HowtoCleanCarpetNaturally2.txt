 If your carpet needs deodorizing, look no further than your kitchen pantry. Baking soda works great for deodorizing because it absorbs odors very effectively. Sprinkle a layer of baking soda all over your carpet, let it sit on the carpet for several hours, and then vacuum it up. The baking soda should absorb a wide variety of odors from your carpet.


Some commercial carpet deodorizers have scents in them that are released when you vacuum up the deodorizer. To mimic this with natural home products, simple mix a few drops of a clear essential oil, such as lavender oil, with a cup of baking soda and then sprinkle it on your carpet. When you vacuum the baking soda up, the smell of the essential oil should be released., Vinegar, like baking soda, can be a great product for deodorizing your carpet because it both absorbs odors and kills odor-causing bacteria. Simply pour some into a spray bottle and then spray a fine mist over your carpet. When the vinegar smell goes away, which may take several hours, you will be left with a deodorized, scent free carpet.If you cannot deal with the scent of vinegar, this may not be the right method for you.
 If you have a small area or spot that needs to be deodorized, consider using lemon. Mix the juice of one lemon with a few tablespoons of water and then dab it on the offending area. The acidity of the lemon should remove even the most unpleasant odors.Once you have dabbed the lemon juice mixture on, rinse the area with soapy water and then dry the area with a cloth.

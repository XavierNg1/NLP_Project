 Turn your Xbox off and wait 5 seconds before turning it back on. When it boots up, reconnect your controller by performing the following steps:


Press and hold the center "X" button to turn the controller on.
Press and release the "connect" button on the front of your Xbox console. It is a small button underneath the "Open Disc Tray" button.
Within 20 seconds, press the "Connect" button on your controller. It is on the top of the controller next to the battery pack.
When the lights on your console stop blinking your controller should be attached., While Xbox controllers typically reach over 30 ft, this range can be compromised by other machines that emit radio waves. Remove wireless devices from between you and the Xbox to establish a better connection. Machines that might interfere with your controller include:


Microwaves
Cordless phones
Wireless Routers
Laptops, While the wireless signal may pass easily through some materials, it can have trouble broadcasting through metal, chrome dividers, entertainment console doors, or shelves.


Try placing your Xbox on the floor and connecting a controller from close range to make sure it can still connect without any interference.
 The Xbox 360 can only accept four controllers at a time, so your wireless controller will not connect if there are already 4 controllers attached.


This includes wired controllers, so detach those then try to reconnect.
You can quickly disconnect controllers by removing the battery pack or restarting the Xbox.
 If you know the batteries are good and you've tried removing all possible interferences, you may need to buy a new controller. Call the Xbox Service Center to see if you are eligible for a free replacement.


Your console must be registered with Microsoft to be eligible for a replacement.

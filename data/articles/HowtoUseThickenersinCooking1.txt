 This is why flour is often used to make gravy or a roux. The following are common ways to use flour to thicken recipes.


Make a roux by melting 1 oz. (30 ml) of butter in a saucepan placed over medium heat. Add 1 oz. (28 g) of flour and stir continuously until the mixture is brown. The longer a roux is browned, the richer the flavor becomes. Take the pan off the stove and whisk in the half pint of animal stock. Whisk vigorously; place it back on the heat to boil. It should boil for at least 2 minutes.
Make a "beurre manie," a common French cooking thickener. Learn how to here:make beurre manie.

Mix equal parts flour with cold water. You can purchase canisters that allow you to easily shake these 2 substances together. Make sure there aren't any lumps before you add this to the gravy. Lumps can be removed by whisking until they are gone. Proceed to whisking the thickener into the gravy.
Both flour and cornstarch start to thicken between 144 and 162째 F (62 to 72째 C). They usually complete their thickening just after boiling at 205째 F (96째 C). Sauces that are thickened with flour may not remain stably thick. They can lose thickness if frozen, thawed or overcooked.;

 When you walk into the room, make eye contact with the casting director and other auditors. Have good posture, and don't walk in too quickly or come in out of breath. From the moment you walk into the room, you'll be judged for your demeanor and presence, so make sure you take a deep breath and collect yourself instead of rushing into the room. You must appear relaxed and confident.
 The mark, usually a simple "x" on the floor made with tape, is the spot where you'll begin acting for the audition. It's usually placed several feet in front of where the casting director and auditors are sitting so they can have the best possible view of your audition.You don't have to feel anchored to the mark throughout the course of your audition; it's just a starting place. You should utilize the space in a way that makes sense for the role you're playing.
 A slate is your one-sentence introduction that you make just before you begin your monologue. When you reach the mark, turn to the casting director, make eye contact, and give your name and a short description of what you're about to do. For example: "Good evening. I'm Felicia Woods, and this piece is from the second act of Hamlet."


Don't spend too much time talking before you perform. Most auditions are timed, and the clock starts ticking as soon as you walk in. You want to maximize your performance time.
Don't ask the casting director and auditors their names, and don't exchange pleasantries beyond saying "good evening" or the like. Again, you don't have time for it.

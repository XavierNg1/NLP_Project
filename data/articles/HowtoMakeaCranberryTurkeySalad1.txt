 Start by taking the turkey and cutting it into small strips or cubes. Make sure the turkey is cooked. You can use light meat or dark meat for the salad.Make the strips or cubes small, about the size of one portion or one bite. You want to make the turkey pieces small enough to mix together with the other ingredients.
You will need 2 to 3 cups of turkey, depending on how much salad you plan to make. For a big batch of salad, use 3 cups of turkey. For a smaller batch, use 2 cups.;
, Next, take ½ cup of dried cranberries and pour them into a colander. Look over the dried cranberries for any very dry or shriveled cranberries and remove them. The cranberries should feel chewy or slightly moist between your fingers.If you have fresh cranberries on hand, you can use them for the salad. Simply wash them off in a colander and set them aside until it’s time to use them.
 You will also need to gather the other ingredients for the salad so they are on hand when you make the salad. You will need:


½ cup sliced almonds, walnuts, or pecans
1 ½ cup chopped celery
¼ cup flat-leaf parsley
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
¼ cup low-fat greek yogurt
Salt
Freshly ground pepper

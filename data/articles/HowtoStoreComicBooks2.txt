 Cardboard is cheap and fairly durable as long as its kept dry, which makes it ideal for your less important books. Slide bagged books into boxes so theyâ€™re standing upright. Avoid acid treated cardboard and packing too many books in a box, as both can cause damage.Generally, you want enough space left in a box so you can comfortably separate comics with your fingers to read titles, but not so much space that the comics are loosely upright.
Use a bookend or a suitable paper weight to hold comics in place for boxes with too few comics. Damage may occur if you allow books to flop around in the boxes.
 Plastic containers will generally offer you a little more protection than cardboard. These are also more resilient to water damage, and some may even offer an airtight seal to protect your comics from the elements.Comic books should be stored in plastic containers similar to cardboard ones: upright and firmly, but not tightly, packed.
 Sunlight causes pages to yellow and ink to fade. Too much moisture or dry heat, on the other hand, causes paper to warp or become brittle. A cool, dry, dark storage location will keep your comic books in the best condition for the longest time., Damage frequently occurs to comics when piled high stacks of containers collapse. Avoid stacking if it can be helped. Keep containers of comics off the floor with pallets and milk crates to prevent potential water damage.

Even cement that is dry throughout the year will conduct cold and draw moisture to your books.

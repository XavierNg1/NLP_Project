Pay attention to where the vehicle is going. Are the back wheels sliding around you to the right? Or are they sliding to the left?
Turn the steering wheel the same direction as the back tires are headed. This recommendation probably seems a little backward to most drivers. The action, actually, will straighten the vehicle's course of direction. Remember to keep your movements smooth and gentle. Jerking the steering wheel will only make things worse.
Compensate for overcompensation. Sometimes the back end of the vehicle will come back around the other side of the automobile. This does not mean that you did anything wrong in your first action. To correct this, turn the steering wheel a little the new direction of the back of the vehicle, opposite your initial turn.
Repeat turning the steering wheel in the direction of the slide until the vehicle straightens out and/or comes to a stop.;

Press lightly and steadily on the brakes of a car with an anti-lock braking system. Do not slam on the brakes as this will increase the intensity and unpredictability of the skid.
Pump the brake pedal of a car without ABS brakes slowly and rhythmically. As the vehicle slows down, you can pump the brakes a little faster.

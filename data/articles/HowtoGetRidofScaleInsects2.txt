 Scales can attack houseplants, even if they are never put outdoors. They often go unnoticed at the greenhouse or store where the houseplant is purchased and flourish on the plant after it is brought home. Remove scales from houseplants by rubbing them off with an old toothbrush, your thumbnail or a cotton swab dipped in Isopropyl rubbing alcohol., Insecticidal soap can also be sprayed on houseplants to kill scales. Mix about 5 tablespoons of insecticidal soap or a very mild dish soap into 1 gallon (3.8Â L) of water.Pour the soap into a spray bottle and spray the plant, including the undersides of the leaves and stems, until the soap solution begins to drip. Repeat the treatment every four to seven days until the scales are gone.
 Do not use laundry soap, automatic dishwasher soap or highly concentrated dish soap that has additives or antibacterial ingredients. They can damage the plant leaves, causing discoloration and leaf tissue damage.

, If you are connected to the Internet, iTunes will automatically upload any information it can find on your particular audio CD.
 Click "Yes" when the dialog box asks if you wish to import all tracks to your iTunes library or "No" if you want to manually select which tracks to import.
 The status of each track you're importing can be seen in the progress bar located at the top of the menu.


Imported songs will appear in the iTunes library list. They will also appear in your iTunes Music folder, if you have selected "Copy files to the iTunes Music folder when adding to library" in the program's "Add to Library" menu.

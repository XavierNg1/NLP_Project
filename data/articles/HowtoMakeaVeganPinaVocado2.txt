 You only need Â½ an avocado for this smoothie, so cut it in half, allowing the knife to run along the large pit.
 Place the bag in the refrigerator to stop the oxidation process (which turns the fruit brown). Remove the pit and discard.
 Depending on the size of the avocado, make four to six long slits down the middle, stopping the cut when the knife hits the tough peel.
 You will essentially be creating small squares.
 Gently allow the slices to fall off the peel. If the avocado does not drop out of the peel on its own, gently run your knife underneath the fruit and between the peel to dislodge it. Add to the blender.

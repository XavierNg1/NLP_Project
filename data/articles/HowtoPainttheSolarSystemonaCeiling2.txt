 Remove unnecessary items from your child's room. Lay down drop cloths to cover the items that aren't practical to move, then sand and prime the ceiling surface as necessary.
 You can do this with a paint roller, ideally one with a long handle that lets you paint without climbing a ladder.
 Depending on how large the ceiling is, you may want to add other space background images, such as nebulae, before painting in the planets, particularly if you want to have a planet overlap them. You can paint these in with artist brushes or sponges.


You can also mix colors onto a board and dip a paint brush until it's loaded full with the paint mixture, then stipple it on the ceiling so that the mixed colors transfer from the brush to the ceiling surface.
 Trace the circles for each planet at the locations on the ceiling you figured out earlier. You can either draw the circles in freehand or use a compass. Sketch in any significant planetary features.


One way to map in planetary features is to draw a grid over the reference image for each planet, then reproduce the grid over the circle on the ceiling in the appropriate size to aid you in transferring the planetary details to the ceiling.
Use a pencil or chalk color that contrasts with your sky color.
 Mentally break each planetary image into layers. Paint in the base color for the planet; then paint the individual details over it.


To make the details stand out more, paint in a darker color first and a lighter color over it. (If you're painting with a sponge, however, you can often get more striking results by using a lighter painted color underneath a darker sponged-on top color.) You can also use the stippling technique described above.
 After you finish painting the planets themselves, you can add in touches as moons of the outer planets and individual stars in the Milky Way. These only need to be individual points or dots of a single color.

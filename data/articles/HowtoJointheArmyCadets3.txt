 They are simple -- you need to be between 18 and 55 years old. No particular skills are required and training is provided.
 ACF adult volunteers assist in a wide range of activities, and even volunteers that can offer only limited weekly time commitments are welcome. Basically, if you want to help the young people of your community learn valuable skills, a place will be found for you.


Consult the ACF website for information on the wide array of skills they seek from volunteers, as well as examples of current volunteers with a variety of backgrounds and skill sets.
 The process is virtually the same as that of a prospective cadet: research your local detachment; click one of the many "join" or "volunteer" tabs on the website; provide basic information about yourself; and also include information about your volunteering interests and past experience with the ACF (if applicable).
 They may invite you to make a visit to meet current volunteers and discuss your interest in joining. Take advantage of this firsthand opportunity to see what your local ACF is all about.

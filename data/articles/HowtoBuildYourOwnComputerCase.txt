 Start off by doing some rough sketches followed by more intricate designs. Think about the material you will need to use to achieve your design. Will it be cardboard, wood, metal, acrylic, glass? Plan out what colors you will use, even down to small details such as LED lights, and graphics. This will allow you to revise your design and get it to a point you will be happy with.;
, It may be that you are thinking of building a wooden case, and a second hand motherboard steel tray could fit in your case perfectly and save you the trouble of drilling holes for different motherboard sizes. Salvaging computer parts and parts of other objects (TV's, VCR's, bar fridges etc) can be very easy and cheap and can assist you with some of the more harder steps in creating a computer case. Recycling plants, online auctions, local auctions, garage sales, and even scrap bins at your local computer store can be ideal places to find cheap or free spare parts to use.
 There are many elements involved that need to be considered such as size, number of drive bays, ventilation, the type of computer that will go into the case and many other aspects. Be sure to look at bare cases online and cover every avenue that you will most likely encounter.
 Being a Do-It-Yourself'er can be an expensive endeavor if you need to purchase all the tools required prior to building your case or while building your case. Typical tools required for wood/metal/acrylic are Jigsaw, hammer drill and/or drill press, hammer, file, sharp knife, masking tape, measuring tape, rotary tool/grinder, rivet gun, heat gun, saw, stain/varnish, spray paint (including primer, color and clear gloss), pencils/markers and various bits and pieces such as nails, screws, rivets, drill bits, clamps. Having the correct blades, bits and pieces for your drill, jigsaw, rotary tool and other equipment is also important.
 There are many videos online for DIY jobs and many specifically on case modding and building cases.

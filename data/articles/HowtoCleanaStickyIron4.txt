 Use equal parts salt and white vinegar. Set the burner to medium-high. Let the solution heat until bubbles start slowly rising, before the mixture comes to a boil.








Crack a window if the smell of vinegar bothers you.
Keep your iron turned off and unplugged.
 Wear gloves to protect your hands. Wet a clean cloth or non-metal scouring pad in the solution by dipping the end into the pot. Use the rag or pad to clean the soleplate in a scrubbing motion: try circular, up and down, and side to side scrubbing until the soleplate is clean.








Don’t submerge your hand in the hot vinegar.
A metal pad can scratch the soleplate of your iron.
 Once you’re finished cleaning the iron with the vinegar-saturated cloth, wet a fresh cloth with distilled water. Wipe down the iron to rinse it. Allow the iron to air dry, or wipe it dry.

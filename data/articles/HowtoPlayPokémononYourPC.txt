 Emulators are applications that replicate the functions of other programs. Nintendo emulators reproduce the functionality of Nintendo devices so you can play on your computer the games that are normally exclusive to DS platforms (or Game Boy).

Some Nintendo emulators that you can download are Visual Boy Advance from http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/gba/vboyadvance.html, and Neon DS from http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/nds/neonds.html.;
, Run the emulator’s installer to begin extracting the program to your computer, and wait for the installation process to finish.
 Double-click on its desktop icon or select it from the list of applications installed in your computer to launch it.
 While emulators function as the console, ROMs are files that contain the replicated data of a console game. Basically, ROMs are the virtual counterparts of gaming cartridges, and just like how a console needs a gaming cartridge to play a game, emulators need ROMs to work.

There several websites on the Internet where you can download ROM files for free. One site where you can get Pokémon ROMs is Cool Rom (http://coolrom.com).
 Since ROMs are created by individuals and not by the game publishers, some console games like Pokémon may not have its ROM counterpart (especially the newly released ones), so you may have to wait for a while before a ROM version becomes available.


Once you find the Pokémon game ROM you’re looking for, download the file from the website and save it in your PC.
 Most emulators have the same user interface; a basic window with a menu bar at the top.
 Do this on the Explorer window. Click the “Open” button to open the selected ROM on your emulator.
 Once it finishes loading the ROM file, the game will automatically start, and you can now play it normally on your PC.

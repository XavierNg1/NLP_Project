 The first and most important thing you can do is be ready. Whether you are a guitar player, drummer, vocalist, bassist or whatever you do ...you need to be prepared so that when the time comes to join a band you will get the spot. Train your talent.;
, For your first time there, leave the gear at home and scope it out. Find out how much stage time each musician gets and whether you can sit in with other musicians or the house band. Become a regular, and get to know the other regulars. If you trained your talent like you were supposed to, people will notice you and other artists will find you.
 It acts as a great icebreaker and can open a lot of doors for you.
 Simply "Guitar Player seeks Band" with your phone number can work, but including your preferred style of music is even better: "Drummer Looking for Metal Band." You can also post an ad in the local paper and Internet classifieds (the latter usually being free; see external links).
 There are many new online services that can help you find a band. One of the best ways to find a band online is to post an ad on all of the classified ad systems you can. Don't limit yourself to just one.
 There are not many online communities just for musicians, so take full advantage of the ones out there.
 By now they've heard you play and know your style, and they've gotten to know you as a person. You've broken the ice without having to audition. Eventually a new band will form, or someone will leave an existing band, and you'll get a call. It's good to have a public artist profile ready when they do to showcase your music. The best way to do that is to simply get a myspace music profile.

 As you breathe in, drag your right knee near to your chest, keeping your left leg on the ground so it is straight.
 Breathe and hold this position for just ten seconds. While you are reading this you might think this is short, but when you are performing this yoga posture it will seem a lot longer.
 Follow this up by hugging both of your knees to your chest for another ten seconds to finish the set. Keep repeating this set as long as you wish.

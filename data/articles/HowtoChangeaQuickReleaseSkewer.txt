 This will loosen the skewer. Locate the cap at the opposite end of the skewer, and unscrew it until the wheel falls out of the dropouts. Continue unscrewing the cap until it is completely detached from the skewer threads. Set aside the cap in a place where it will not get lost. If you purchased a new skewer, don't worry about the cap for the old skewer.;
, Take off the spring, and clean the skewer at this point if you intend to reuse it. If you are replacing a quick release skewer, set aside or dispose of the old one.
, Put the spring on with the smaller end aiming toward the wheel. Gently compress the spring with the cap, and slowly turn the cap just enough to get it attached without falling off. Put the wheel into the dropouts, and finish tightening the cap.

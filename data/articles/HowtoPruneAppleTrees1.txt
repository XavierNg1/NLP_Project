 As soon as you realize your apple tree needs pruning, it can be tempting to jump to it and start lopping off branches immediately. However, it is important to prune at the right time to avoid damaging your tree. Prune in the first month or two of spring, at least two weeks after the last frost.









If you need to, pruning can occur later in the spring and early in the summer.
Avoid pruning in the fall, as new growth will be stimulated but will die off from the cold of winter.;
, A well pruned healthy apple tree will be a poor shade tree; it should have significant spacing between branches.
 Pruning requires some specific tools in order to prevent damage to the tree. The blades you use to cut branches should be proportional in size to the branches you cut. For small limbs, use hand pruners. Larger branches that are about 1” thick can be cut off with loppers. Use a saw (a folding saw works well) to cut any branches wider than 3”.
 If your apple tree is a good shade tree, then it is an obvious candidate for pruning. However, pruning should not be done on all trees. Hold off on heavy pruning until your tree is at least three years old. If a significant amount of pruning needs to be done for a tree, do portions of it over several seasons.









Pruning young or small trees is done to encourage a strong framework and starting shape.
Pruning large or matured trees encourages larger, healthier fruit and maintains the overall shape.

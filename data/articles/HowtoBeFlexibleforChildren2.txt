 Stand straight up with your feet together and your arms by your sides. Jump to separate your feet, while simultaneously lifting your arms overhead. Then jump your feet back together, while simultaneously returning your arms to your sides.Do fifteen jumping jacks in a row to get your blood pumping.
As you get older and stronger, you may want to increase the number of jumping jacks you do.
 Stand with your legs slightly wider than your hips. Lift your arms overhead, then make a circle with your arms going towards your hips, then up over your head.Keep your arms straight at all times.
Do ten arm circles going forward, then reverse and do ten backwards arm circles.
 Stand on your right foot, with your left foot in the air. Hop on the right foot, then step down on your left foot. Speed this motion up until you are able to skip.Once you are confident skipping, skip back and forth for a minute at a time.
As you get stronger and more flexible, increase the length of time that you spend skipping each day.
 Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and facing forward. Keeping the weight in your toes, slowly bend your knees and lower your body towards the ground.Pause at the ground, then slowly rise back up to your previous position and do the motion again.
Hold your arms out in front of you for balance.

, This is where your creativity comes in. Think of a rumor that's nice and won't hurt anybody/thing. The best rumors are ones that involve the PS4 system and will affect the most amount of people. In this article, my example rumor will be about a new PS5 system.
 You still want people to open the message, but they won't if you tell them everything in the subject. For my rumor, I put "PS5" as my subject.
 Make sure it follows the following criteria: 1. Make it sound formal. 2. Type in third-person. No I, me, we, us, etc. 3. Make sure it's about the same thing as the subject. 4. Give them a reason to pass it on other than the fact it's interesting. For example, in mine I put "If Playstation sees this message get passed around 500,000 times then they'll release the PS5 by January, 2015". 5. Ask them to copy the exact message and paste it on messages to send to their friends. This is to avoid the facts from the rumor being changed.
, This is the experiment part of it: See how long it takes before that one friend receives it and sends it to you.

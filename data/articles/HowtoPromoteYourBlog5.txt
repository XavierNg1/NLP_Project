 Email is often overlooked with the advent of social media, but the fact of the matter is that almost everyone still uses email on a daily basis. Creating a mailing list will help you connect with your most passionate readers.
 Use a newsletter to keep your subscribers up to date with happenings on your blog. Include quick summaries of your posts with links to the full article. A newsletter is a great way to keep less active readers engaged in your articles.
 Use email to send a blog post youâ€™re particularly proud of to friends, other bloggers, and the mainstream press. Avoid sending email updates for every post you make, but do this occasionally to increase your reach. If the post is especially good, other bloggers may link it in their posts, which can drive lots of traffic to your blog.

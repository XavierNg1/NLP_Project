 Make sure that the bowl is large enough to hold the beaten heavy cream as well.
 Keep folding and stirring until it is evenly combined., Gently fold in your desired additions or flavorings with a spatula. Be careful not to over-mix, or your ice cream will lose its fluffiness. Here are some ideas to get you started:To make mint-chip ice cream, add a few drops of peppermint extract and a handful of mini chocolate chips.

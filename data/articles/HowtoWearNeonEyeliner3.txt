 To start, use the tip of the pencil or brush to add a layer of eyeliner to your upper lash line. This is the line just above your eyelashes. Trace the line using the pencil or brush to draw a thin line of neon running just above your eye.Some people prefer to start with a thin line near the corners of the eye and broaden it as you reach the tip. This can be helpful if you want to add a cat eye.
 A cat eye is a small wing on the end of each eye. To draw a cat eye, extend the line of neon slightly outward after you reach the end of your lash line. Then, draw a small triangular shape sticking out of the corner of your eye. Bring the triangle back into your lower lash line by drawing a line connecting it to the bottom of your eye., Your waterline is the small patch of skin inside your lower lash line. Use the brush or tip or pencil to color this line in a neon shade.Not all eyeliners should be used on your waterline. Refer to package instructions to make sure your eyeliner is safe to use on your lash line.

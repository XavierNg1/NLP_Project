 If you're using PowerPoint 2007 or earlier, movie files are not embedded, they're "linked." This means that the video is not actually included in the PowerPoint presentation file. The video file exists separately from the presentation file, and the presentation loads the video file from the specified location. You won't see a literal hyperlink, but PowerPoint will need to have an accurate location of the video on the computer in order to play it.

Videos can only be "embedded" (included in the presentation file itself) in PowerPoint 2010 or newer.
 You can add videos to any slide in your PowerPoint presentation., This will display various options for inserting objects into your presentation., This will open your file browser so that you can select your movie file., PowerPoint 2007 only supports a handful of video formats, including AVI, MPG, and WMV. If you're using AVi files, you may want to convert them to MPG or WMV first to avoid codec issues when trying to play the video., Once you've selected the video, you'll be prompted to select how you want it to start playing. If you select "Automatically," the video will begin playing as soon as the slide opens. If you select "When Clicked," you'll need to click the video to begin playing it., Since your video plays from a specific location, recipients won't be able to watch it if you send them the presentation unless you send the video too. Using the "Package for CD" feature allows you to send the presentation and any associated media as one package.

Click the Office button and select "Publish."
Select "Package for CD" and then select your presentation.
Ensure that "Linked files" is selected in the "Options" menu.

 After the DDS has reviewed all the information regarding your mental or physical impairment, they will send you a letter by mail informing you whether or not you were approved for benefits.


Review the outcome of your disability claim. If you were approved for benefits, the letter will notify you of information regarding your disability payments; however, if your claim was denied, you will be given instructions on how to file an appeal if you disagree with the outcome.

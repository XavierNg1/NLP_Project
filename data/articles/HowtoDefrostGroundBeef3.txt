 Remove the beef from its packaging and place it flat inside a microwavable container. Cover the dish.









Since this is a very quick method, you can perform it immediately before starting dinner. You do not need to worry as much about starting the defrosting process in advance.
Prying the ground beef out of the package can be difficult if it is fully frozen and sitting on a Styrofoam tray. If you have difficulty removing the beef from its backing, place the beef inside a resealable plastic bag, zip it closed, and rinse the tray-side of the beef under cold running tap water until it loosens enough to remove.
 Use 50 percent power instead of 100 percent to help prevent the meat from beginning to cook.








Some microwaves have specific defrost settings. These settings automatically calculate how long to microwave the meat and at which power percentage. Select the defrost setting on your microwave, if you have one, and input the number of pounds being thawed.
Rotate, if necessary. Most microwaves have rotating turntables that continuously turn the contents of the microwave. If yours does not, however, you should pause the defrosting process every 2 minutes and manually rotate the ground beef 180 degrees.
 Press into the center of the mass to feel for spots that are still frozen solid.









If necessary, split the block in half and feel the inside middle for possible frozen spots.
 Defrosted ground beef that was thawed in the microwave must be used within 2 hours to be safe.









Do not attempt to refreeze raw ground beef that has been defrosted in the microwave. You can, however, cook the beef and refreeze it afterward.

 After going through the history of President Lincoln, you can construct his famous stovepipe hat. Place a picture at the front of the classroom of Lincoln wearing his hat.
 Allow it to dry. Once it is dry, turn it over and paint the other side.
 Place a 2 inch (5.1Â cm) strip of glue on the front of 1 sheet and press the edge of the other sheet onto it so that they are perfectly aligned. Allow the glue to dry before continuing.
 Before gluing, check that the tube is small enough when rolled so that there remains a brim on your paper plate. Put a strip of glue onto the other side of construction paper to secure the tube of black construction paper.
 Use your scissors to poke a hole in the center of the paper plate. Cut triangles into the center of the plate and fold them back.


The triangles will be formed when you cut the diameter of the circle you have just drawn both ways. Cut the triangles in half again to better secure them onto the tube (stovepipe).
 Place craft glue onto the inside triangles on the paper plate and place them on top of the paper plate. Press the glued triangles onto the inside of the stovepipe.


Working upside down on this step will make it easier to affix the paper plate to the stovepipe. Once you are finished pressing the glue onto the inside of the construction paper, you can turn it around and allow it to dry.
 Place a bead of glue around the top of the construction paper and set the circle on top. Allow the hat plenty of time to dry before using it a hat or a centerpiece.

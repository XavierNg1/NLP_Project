 When you overeat, write down any factors that triggered you to overeat. Identifying triggers like negative emotions, stress or even people who encourage poor habits so that you can address the problems in a healthier way.
 Choose a notebook that will fit in your purse or in your pocket.
 If you weigh yourself and find that you’ve gained 1 or 2 pounds, then you know that you need to get back on track. Don’t allow your weight to continually creep upward; be proactive to address setbacks by always knowing how much you weigh.
 For instance, a photograph of yourself at your maximum weight or a nice ring or bracelet that you purchase as a weight loss reward can remind you of the benefits of losing weight even when you aren’t feeling motivated.
 If you start to regain weight and to grow out of the clothing, then the expense of replacing it will motivate you to check your weight gain.

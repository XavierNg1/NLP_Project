 Trace around your hand's fingers and thumb. The thumb will be the face of your turkey, the hand will represent the body, and your fingers will represent its feathers. You can use any color of pencil you want for the outline, but make sure that the color stands out so people can see it.

If you use regular computer paper, your final product may be flimsy or fragile. Instead of using regular paper, consider using cardstock or white construction paper.
Good colors for the outline of your turkey include dark blue or black colored pencils.
 Draw a small triangle on the end of your thumb, to resemble the beak of the bird. You can also draw a wattle, which looks like a red tear drop under the beak. Draw a circle with a black dot in the middle to represent your turkey's eye.The beak of the bird should be orange, while the wattle is usually red.
 Use a brown or yellow colored pencil to color in the body of the bird. If you want to make colorful wings, choose different colored pencils. Use brighter colors like green, red, yellow and orange to make the colors pop. To make your bird's feathers look realistic, use quick strokes. Once you're done coloring the turkey, you're done with the project.You can glue candy corn to your fingers to give your feathers a more colorful look.You can also draw feet onto the bird with yellow colored pencils.

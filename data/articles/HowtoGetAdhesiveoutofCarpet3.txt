 Even if the super glue has already dried, you can still try to remove any excessive adhesive.


To remove super glue that has already dried, apply acetone nail polish remover to a cotton ball and dab it on the spot. Only apply it to a small area to start. If you notice the nail polish remover is damaging your carpet, discontinue use immediately. Otherwise, you can continue applying it to the rest of the stain.Use a wet cloth to blot the area, to pull up any adhesive and to remove excess nail polish remover.
 Once most of the adhesive and nail polish has been absorbed, apply a cleaning agent that contains d-Limonene. This is a natural, environmentally friendly cleaning solution.


You can either ask a salesperson for help at any major retail store or can do a quick search online. Amazon offers a multitude of products, which contain d-Limonene and can be shipped directly to your house.
Apply the product to the spot with a cloth. You can wear gloves if youâ€™d like, but d-Limonene is a natural substance.Consult the directions on the container and leave it sit on the spot as directed.
Use a separate, wet cloth to wipe away any residue that is left. You will need to thoroughly scrub this area, as d-Limonene will leave a residue.
 Goo Gone is one of the most popular gel solvents. You can use this in lieu of d-Limonene products.


Apply Goo Gone directly to the spot and leave it sit for one minute.
Use a wet cloth to wipe away the Goo Gone.
Pat the spot dry and let it sit. You may need to reapply the Goo Gone and rinse the area again if the spot is still present.

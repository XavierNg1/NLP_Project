 It is difficult to predict if the venue will be too warm or too cold, though you can usually bet on it being hot if itâ€™s going to be a huge, crowded concert. To keep warm on your way to and from the concert during colder months, wear layers, such as a t-shirt with a bomber jacket over it. The bomber jacket is lightweight but will keep you warm if you need it. It can also be easily tied around your waist if you choose to ditch it in the middle of the concert.If you are attending a more subdued concert, it may be cooler inside the venue than you may expect. Wear either a lightweight jacket or a thick sweater over a shirt to ensure you stay warm during the concert, if you need to.
Attending a concert is a great excuse to break out one of your favorite band t-shirts.
 Lively concerts will often have everyone dancing and even moshing. Protect your feet and toes by wearing a pair of sturdy, yet stylish boots. If attending a rock or pop concert, try a pair of combat boots, which are stylish while still being heavy duty enough to protect your feet and keep them warm, if necessary. If you are attending a country concert, you can simply wear your favorite pair of cowboy boots. A concert in which everyone will be seated for the majority of the time will not necessarily require you to wear closed-toe shoes.
 You will want to incorporate powder into your makeup routine to stay looking fresh throughout the concert. Stay away from liquid and glossy products, as they will fade quickly as you sweat and could even smear. Finish off your look with a translucent setting powder to ensure that your makeup stays and does not rub off as you sweat. Keep the powder with you in your bag so that you can touch up as needed.


Opt for a powder foundation, such as Bare Minerals, to ward off shine throughout the concert.

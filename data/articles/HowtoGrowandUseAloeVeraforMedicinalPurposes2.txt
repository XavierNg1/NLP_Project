 Your aloe plantâ€™s leaves are filled with aloe gel that you can harvest as needed for medicinal use. Wait until you need the gel to harvest it. When you need some aloe gel, cut one of the leaves from your aloe plant and squeeze or scoop out the clear aloe gel.


If you are harvesting a large amount, you may need to cut the leaf in half (lengthwise) in order to get all of the gel out.
Try to only harvest as much as you need at one time. If you have any leftover gel, you can store it in an airtight container in your refrigerator for up to a week., You can apply fresh aloe gel to your sunburn to help cool and heal your burn. Apply the gel to your sunburnt skin and reapply ever few hours or as needed to keep your skin moisturized.

Then use your fingertips to massage the gel into your scalp and leave the gel in your hair. Repeat this process each time you wash your hair., Aloe has been found likely to be effective as a treatment for the herpes virus, also known as cold sores.

Repeat the application as needed to keep the sore covered in aloe gel., Aloe can also be used as a moisturizer or treatment for dry skin. Try replacing your normal lotion with fresh aloe vera gel. Use the aloe gel the same way that you would use a body lotion. Apply it to the skin all over your body and massage it in until it is absorbed.

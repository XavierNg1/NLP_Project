 One look you can do with a deep side part is to alternate curls. Using a medium to large curling iron, curl the first small section of hair towards your face. With the next section, curl away from your face. That creates a nice wave with your curls., Another option is to straighten your hair. A deep side part works equally well with curly or straight hair. After you've figured out where your part will be, use a straightening iron to smooth out your hair in small sections. You might want to use a protective spray beforehand to keep your hair from being damaged., Start with volumizing spray while your hair is still wet, but concentrate it on the roots. Use a blow dryer to dry off your hair, but as you do, lift up your hair from the roots, so it dries a bit lifted. Make sure to part your hair as it gets close to being dry, then use the blow dryer to dry it into place.You're creating more texture up top so it doesn't look like you just combed your hair over.
 Another option is to twist or pull part of your hair back. On the side with less hair, pull back most of the hair. You can now twist it or just leave it straight. Pin it in place at the nape of your neck with bobby pins.Try criss-crossing the bobby pins to help them stay in place., When you're parting your hair deeply, you may need to use a hair product to help keep it in place. You can lightly spray your hair with hair spray, for instance, or use a lightweight styling gel. Either way, adding a little product will help keep your hairdo looking nice all day or night.

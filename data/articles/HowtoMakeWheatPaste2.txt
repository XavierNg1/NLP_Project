 Using your preferred tool (such as a paintbrush or your gloved hands), apply a liberal coat of paste to a wall. It will adhere strongly to wood, stone, and most other surfaces.









Remove any lumps from the paste to prevent bubbles and lumps from tearing the poster.
Attaching posters to other people's property or in public places is illegal in some regions.
 Do this slowly, rolling it up from one side to prevent wrinkles from forming.









For very large posters or high surfaces, a push broom may be useful.
 A glossy, sticky layer over the whole poster will dry into a strong adherent.








If you used whole wheat flour, the paste may have brown flecks or tinge. Apply such paste lightly to avoid obscuring the poster.
If you don't have enough time or paste to cover the entire poster, prioritize the corners or furthest edges.

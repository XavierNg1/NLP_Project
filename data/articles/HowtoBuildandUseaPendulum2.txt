 You'll do this by holding the weighted end of the strings, where the washers or pennies are. Depending on the angle, the frequency of the pendulum can change.


For example, releasing the pendulum from a 90 degree angle to the meter stick might give you a different frequency of motion than, say, a 45 degree angle.
 Make sure that you're releasing it so that it won't hit anything during its swing. If it hits something you'll have to start over again. While you're letting the pendulum go, you're going to be timing its arc so be ready.
 Start timing the pendulum as soon as you release it. When the pendulum returns to its original position, stop timing. It can be helpful to have an assistant while you do this, so you can manage the pendulum while they manage the stopwatch.


The single arc that the pendulum makes is called the “period of the pendulum.” You can also find out the frequency by seeing how many times it swings back and forth per second.
 Time it to find out if the pendulum makes the same time as it did the first release. Make sure that you're releasing from the same angle. Have you noticed any change?

, Make note of the times of the period of the pendulum and its frequency so that when you start doing creative things with your pendulum you can see how things change.


This will help you to understand the two major applications of pendulums. One is for time telling, the other is called the Foucault Pendulum. For the former, the motion of the pendulum governs the movement of the clock hands.
The Foucault Pendulum demonstrates the rotation of the earth. It has to be incredibly large (sometimes over two stories high) so that it will swing over a longer period of time.

 Measure the width of your bed and how high you want your headboard to go from the top of your bed. These will be your measurements for your piece of plywood.;
, You can choose rectangle, oval, octagonal, or any shape of your choice. Most leather headboards are rectangular.
 Ask a home improvement store to cut the plywood to your specifications. If you own a jigsaw, you may choose to cut it yourself.
 You can choose a fabric especially made for upholstery that will be more sturdy. Depending upon the width of your bolt of fabric, you may need to stitch sections of fabric together in order to be able to cover your piece of plywood.


Bring your headboard measurements into the fabric store. You will need enough fabric to cover the front of your fabric and to wrap leather around the back of the headboard. Add approximately 1 foot (30.5 cm) to the height and width measurements of your plywood.
 Lay down a drop cloth to catch dust. Cover the table with a fitted sheet, if you want to protect it.

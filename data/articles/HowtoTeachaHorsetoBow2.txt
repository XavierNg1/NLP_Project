 Hold the horse's lead rope loosely but securely in one hand. Leave the other hand free to stroke the horse, and to grab treats. You should keep the treats in a pocket well out of reach of the horse, so that it won't be tempted to reach and grab them.Remember to always retain control of the horse's treats, only allowing the horse to eat one when it does what you want. If the horse figures out it can get the treats from you without doing what you want, it may be very difficult to train.
 The idea is to encourage your horse to lower its head as far as it is willing to. Move the treat down, towards its feet, until it is reluctant to lower it further, then praise the horse and allow it to eat the treat. This will teach the horse to associate lowering its nose at your command with receiving treats.If the horse does not seem to understand, you can encourage it to lower its head with a light, constant tug downwards on its lead rope. Don't try to force the horse's head (it's stronger than you), and don't tug suddenly or violently on the rope.
 Now that the horse is able to reach down, you will want to start training it to do so on command. Continue practicing the excercise with a treat presented below the horse's legs, but start incorporating spoken commands along with the treats. Choose something short and simple like "bow down". State the command before you offer the treat between the horse's legs.Repeat the command throughout the exercise. Then reward and praise the horse.
 Accomplish this by holding the treat further and further towards the ground, rewarding the horse only when it lowers its head further than it did on the previous attempt. Repeat until the horse is bending its neck nearly to the ground, or even bending one of its front legs slightly.

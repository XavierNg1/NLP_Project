 Find a new spot in the garden for your divided daffodil offsets. They will prefer a sunny patch, although they’ll tolerate partial shade for some of the day. A daffodil plant needs to receive at least three hours of sunlight per day.
 Daffodils need a well-drained soil, so try to avoid planting them anywhere that puddles form and don’t easily drain away. Daffodil bulbs rot easily in wet ground.


It’s a good idea to incorporate plenty of compost or organic matter, such as well-rotted horse manure, into the soil. If you aren’t sure how much to use, cover your soil to a depth of 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) with the manure and then mix it with the existing soil.
If your soil is clay heavy and tends to retain water, you might may want to add some grit into the soil to improve drainage.
 To plant each bulb, dig a hole three times as deep as the bulb is wide—that’s around 6 inches (15.2 cm) in depth for a 2 inch (5.1 cm) bulb.


If you can, add a trowel full of compost to the bottom of the hole for the bulb to sit on. Put the bulb in the hole with the pointed end facing upwards.
Fill the hole with soil and water well. You might like to top-dress (add a top layer) of fertilizer or mulch.
 Now go back to the area where your bulbs were growing originally and replant the bulbs using the same approach. Having such a crowd of bulbs in this patch may have taken a lot of the nutrients from the soil, so it’s especially important to refresh the ground with fertilizer in this spot.
 In the fall, give your transplanted bulbs a good feed with a water-soluble fertilizer. During the fall the roots are most actively growing, so the fall feeding will help your transplanted bulbs get established in their new home. All bulbs will appreciate an annual top dressing of fertilizer or mulch.

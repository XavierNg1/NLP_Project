 However, don't jump up and down around your friends who didn't make it and explain how excited you are.
 If a friend doesn't make it, you should understand and try to comfort them. And, if your friend doesn't make it,you guys could go out for ice cream to celebrate getting through tryouts (could also do this before results are posted).
 You could always tryout for a different sport! Crying shows others how much you expected to make it, and how you can't believe you didn't. And if you try out next year, they are going to remember that you cried, which will make them think you are not right for the team. It is okay to show you are sad or disappointed, though.
, This shows that even if you made it or not, you still plan on keeping all your friends.

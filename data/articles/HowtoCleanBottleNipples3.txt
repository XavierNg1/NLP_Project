 Most bottles are dishwasher safe on the top shelf, but you should check with the bottle or nipple manufacturer to be sure.


Rinse the nipple with warm water and place it in a basket or mesh bag on the top rack of the dishwasher and run a normal or gentle cycle with the rest of your dishes.
The basket or bag keeps the nipple from getting lost in the dishwasher and is available at any baby store., Make sure the water is heated and that the dishwasher is set to a hot drying cycle so that water can dry quickly and not cause a risk of mold if it lingers on the nipple., Hand washing or using the dishwasher are both effective ways for cleaning a bottle nipple at each use—there isn’t a method that is more effective than another, so choose the one that works for your baby and your lifestyle.

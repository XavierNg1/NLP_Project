 Take 1/2 a stick of butter at room temperature and mash it with a fork. Add 1/4 cup of sugar and 2 tablespoons of cinnamon to the butter. Mix these three things together with a fork until it becomes a mushy, uniformed consistency.To get the butter to room temperature, take it out of the refrigerator half an hour before you begin making your toast.
 Using a butter knife, spread the cinnamon butter on a piece of toast of your choice. Spread as much or as little butter as you'd like.
 Place the bread in the oven at 350 degrees. Let the bread cook for 10 minutes. You want to melt the butter and cook it into the bread slowly.
 After 10 minutes, move the bread to the broiler. Let it brown for a few minutes, until the bread is to your desired level of crispness. Make sure to watch the bread so it doesn't burn.


You do not flip over this toast. The bottom will be toasted from cooking in the oven for 10 minutes.

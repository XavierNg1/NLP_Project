 A girl doesn't like to be pushed too far out of her comfort zone, especially on a First Kiss. Let it happen naturally.;
,, Now you can either go in for it or you can compliment her for something she is wearing or something that you like about her.
 It's better to wait until she's ready. Otherwise, it will create a very awkward situation.
Tilt your head and go in 90% and let her come the rest of the way.
 It's a tease and is a basic attribute of attraction.
 Make her comfortable, you want her to want to kiss you again!

, This should depend on what you're doing; something like "Do you want to go back to the group?" or "Do you want to go out again sometime?" "I Love You" is another great thing to say, but only if you mean it! Also if you like you can bite your bottom lip gently whilst smiling to make her think "that was nice" or even say it to her.
 While you're sitting, side-by-side, turn to her. Touch her on the arm so she looks at you. Make eye contact, then start getting closer and see where things go from there.

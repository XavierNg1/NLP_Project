 Although it might be difficult, you may need to check on your baby often for the first few nights to make sure that he stays on his back and does not roll over. If you notice your baby moving onto his side, then you can gently turn him onto his back again., Extending your baby’s arms may also help to keep her in position. Some babies will stay on their backs if you extend their arms out to both sides. Try gently extending your baby’s arms when you lay her down to sleep., A reflux wedge will raise your baby’s upper body, which may make him feel more comfortable. A reflux wedge may be especially helpful if your baby dislikes back sleeping due to acid reflux or GERD. You can find a reflux wedge for your baby in most large department stores.To use a reflux wedge, place it under your baby’s back before you lay him down for a nap or for bedtime. Make sure that your baby is centered on the wedge.

 Co-sleepers are bassinets that attach to the parent's bed. They make it easy to have your baby close to you without the danger of rolling onto your baby in the night. Co-sleepers also provide an easy way for you to check on your baby and reposition him as needed.


For example, if your baby moves onto his side, then you can gently move him so that he is on his back.
 Elevating the head of your baby’s crib is another good way to make her feel more comfortable while sleeping on her back. Purchase special blocks specifically for this purpose.


Place the blocks under the feet at the head of your baby’s crib to elevate the head of the crib by about 15 to 30 degrees.

 While dogs are naturally omnivorous, it is possible for them to develop sensitivities, allergies, and other stomach troubles. Frequent culprits for doggy food sensitivities include the proteins found in chicken and eggs, beef and dairy, wheat, and soy. In such cases, switching your dog to a vegan or vegetarian diet may be the solution.


Allergy symptoms to look out for include itchy skin, hair and fur loss, ear infections, and frequent vomiting and diarrhea. Consult your veterinarian if your dog is exhibiting any of these signs., When it comes to a boil, add the rice, lentils, and sweet potatoes. Lower the heat enough to reduce the pot to a simmer, and cook until everything is soft, about 40 minutes to an hour.
 When the grains, legumes, and sweet potatoes have cooked until they’re soft, take the pot off the heat. Use a fork or potato masher to partially mash the sweet potatoes. Allow the mixture to cool, approximately 30 minutes.
 Give it all a good stir. When it has cooled fully to room temperature, transfer to airtight containers and store in the refrigerator, or in the freezer in individual portions.
 At feeding time, take a portion of food and stir in the hemp protein, flaxseed oil, cranberry extract, multivitamin, digestive enzyme, and probiotic.


Use the recommended servings based on your dog's needs and weight.
The cranberry extract will help balance the pH levels of your pooch’s urine, and the digestive enzyme will help your dog absorb the highest possible amount of nutrients.

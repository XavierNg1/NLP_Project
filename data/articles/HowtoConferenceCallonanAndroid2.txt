 Conference call app is a free app to make conference calls on android. It allows you to connect 10 users at a time. Locate the app on your home screen or app drawer, and tap on it.


If you don’t have Conference Caller yet, you can download it for free from Google Play.
 On the main app screen, you will be asked two options: “One conference provider” or “Different conference provider.” Tap the option you want to use and tap “Next.”


One conference provider—Select this mode if you will use only one and the same conference provider. In this mode, you select one global phone number to the conference provider you use for conference calls.
Different conference provider—Select this mode if you will use different conference providers. In this mode, you specify the phone number to dial in each conference item object.
 Once you’ve selected an option, you will be taken to the main app screen displaying all conference groups you’ve created. If you already have a group, proceed to the next step; otherwise, tap the + icon on the right top corner of the screen. On the screen that appears, enter a name for the group then add members’ phone numbers.


To add phone numbers, tap the dotted icon next to the “Phone number to call” heading. Tap the + icon at the top, and in the window that pops up, select the country to which the number belongs. Add the city name, if you want, and then the contact’s phone number. When you’re done, tap “OK.”
Continue adding contact numbers of the members of this group. You can add up to 10 numbers.
 On the main app screen, tap the green-colored phone icon adjacent to the group you want to call. A menu will pop up asking “Complete action using.” Tap on “Phone” followed by “Just once.” The call will start.


The app will automatically put you on hold after a few seconds to make the next call in the group. You will be connected again once the next person picks up.
End the conference call by tapping the red phone icon on the screen when you’re done.

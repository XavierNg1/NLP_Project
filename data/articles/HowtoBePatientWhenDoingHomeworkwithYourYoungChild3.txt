 Young kids are accustomed to their parents swooping in to help them when they are confused or scared. Try not to let this become a habit during homework time. Your child may need you to read the instructions, but let them take a stab at completing any problems on their own first.


If they ask for your help, say, “Let me see you try first.” If they ask a question about something, say “What do you think?”
When reviewing what they have done, don’t check and correct all the work. Make sure they get the hang of it and suggest that they look back over it. But, never correct their work for them. Teachers need a measure of your child’s understanding, not yours.
 Although educators believe parental involvement is key to a thriving student, they notice that children whose parents offer more coaching often have poorer performance. Show them how to help themselves instead of over-functioning and doing the work for them.For example, show them how to use resources to check over their work or find answers.
 Children need to see that you are proud of their accomplishments, so be sure to give a high-five for positive efforts towards a task. You might also display art projects or great test grades., As your child starts to get the hang of doing homework, slowly reduce the amount of time you spend hovering over them. Let them develop some autonomy with homework.

Back off a bit and let them come to you if they have questions. Review their work only once they’re done rather than throughout the time they’re working. Also, give them more physical space by moving your work to another area or allowing them to work in their room or another space.
You’ll still want to remain in the general area or check in periodically. Kids work best when they know you are nearby.

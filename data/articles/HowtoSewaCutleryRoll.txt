 Fold the bottom end third of the way. Iron/press a crease. Then, fold the tea towel in half from the top. Iron this fold too, to form a sharp crease., It needs to be one third the size of the folded tea towel. Pin this onto the tea towel at the back, through each layer. Line it up to the folded part., Along the length of the folded part of the tea towel, rule lines at intervals of around 2cm/just under an inch. Sew along each line through all layers, either by hand or by machine. This forms the cutlery compartments., Fold over the top third of the tea towel and sew all around the edge except for leaving one gap of 5cm/2.5"; this gap allows for turning around the right way. Trim each corner, then turn to the right side using the gap hole. Sew the gap up once turned., Use scrap fabric or ribbon as ties; you may need to sew the ties neatly down the length to prevent fraying (to do this, simply fold the edges to the center, iron into place, then sew)., Roll up the roll and tie together using the ties.

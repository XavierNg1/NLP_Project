 Tightly squeeze or roll the oranges firmly with the palm of your hand across the counter or table to soften them up.






;
, Slice the orange in half and remove the seeds. If you want to go seedless, use navel oranges.
 Grip the one of the orange halves tightly and squeeze it by hand, using a plain juicer to coax all the juice out.
 Scrape the orange with a spoon and add the pulp directly to the juice if you use a hand juicer. If you prefer clear juice, pour the juice through a strainer before drinking.Add some pinch of black salt or sugar for more flavor. Some oranges are already sweet.
 Enjoy a crisp, cold glass of freshly squeezed, unpasteurized orange juice, the way it was intended to be!

 On the Webkinz News Page, there are many contests happening every few weeks! Enter, and you can win free EXCLUSIVE or ESTORE items. Many of these contests require decorating rooms, but some are as effortless as writing a couplet poem!;
, Sometimes, hourly events have coupon offers, take advantage of them! You can get big deals, and use them in the W-Shop. Make sure to use coupons on more expensive items like furniture, rather than cheap things like food.
 That's right, every pet you adopt you get Kinzcash, Exclusives, and Food! Not to mention a new room, and possibly a super bed. The more the merrier definitely describes this one.
 Whether they're just online pals or your BFF from preschool, make friends, even with your opponent from the tournament arena! Not only is this good courtesy, but it may get you free items. Always treat your friends nicely, send them gifts, or letters, and you just might get something back! NOTE: Don't use people just for gifts. A true friend would never do that. But Karma goes around, so be nice!

, This will be the best food investment you've made, ever! Seeds costs as little as 30 to 40 Kinzcash, so stock up, devote a few minutes to planting, and you'll never go hungry or have to buy W-Shop food again. Plus, excess crops can be sold for Kinzcash.

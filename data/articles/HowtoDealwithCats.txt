 Did a cat scratch you when you were younger? Did your older brother torment you by locking you up in a closet with a claustrophobic cat? Do you hate the smell of their poop? Do you think cats are the ugliest things in the world? Identify why you hate cats, and try to fix it.


If you're scared, watch a family member interact with the cat. The cat's not so bad, is it? Once you've seen a family member interact, you try!
Do you hate kitty poo? Keep the litter box in a space where you won't have to smell it, and try baking soda to lessen the smell.

, You've heard that a cat's favorite person is the one who hates them the most, and that is usually true because you ignore them. Cats find that behavior as a "yay, I like this kitty!" So acknowledge your cat! Occasionally pet them and play with them.
 Cats don't like it, so to get the cat to ignore you, stare at him/her in the eye often.
 Sometimes, cats will come in and sleep on top of you. That can get annoying, so to ensure the cat won't come in, you may have to get used to sleeping with the door closed.
 Everyone, whether they adore their cat or despise them, hate the smell of litter. Keep the litter box in a spot where you don't go often, like the storage room.
 One of the most aggravating things cats do is scratch your furniture to shreds. You can't get your cat not to scratch, since it is somethings they absolutely have to do, but if you buy your cat a nice scratching post, then the cat will be deterred from scratching up your furniture.
 Face it, it's not the easiest thing to do, living with a creature you hate, so be flexible. Say things to yourself like, "well, Fluffy is pretty cute," or "you know what? Cats aren't so bad after all!"

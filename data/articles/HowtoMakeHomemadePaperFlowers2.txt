 Get red crepe, wax, or glassine paper and cut it into circles at the size you want your poppies to be. Once you have the circles, form the petals by cutting rounded indents at three points just a short way into the paper. You will need 2 circles per flower that you want to make., Press your finger into the center of the circles and pull the edges of the circle up around in until you have a cup-like shape. Squeeze, roll, and generally further create wrinkles that start at the base and move toward the edge of the petals. Flatten the circles back out when you feel it is wrinkled enough.
 Cut from the rounded indents that you made until about two thirds of the way into the circle.
 Put a dot of glue at the center of one circle and attach it to another circle, staggering the petals to make the flower look more real and full.
 Using small squares or circles of green and black tissue paper, do a similar wrinkling process to create the center of the flower.
 Place the black tissue center on top of the green tissue center and glue them together in that way. Then, glue them at the center of the flower.
 Using white out or white paint, dab dots of white onto the tips of the black paper to complete the poppy look.

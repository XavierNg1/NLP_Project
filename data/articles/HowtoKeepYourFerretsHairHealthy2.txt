 Ferrets have a slightly higher normal body temperature than people. Water that is warm to us may be cold to a ferret. Whatever container you use needs to be just full enough of water so the ferret’s head is just above the water when it stands up.A ferret’s normal body temperature is 102 degrees Fahrenheit.
 You’ll need to purchase a shampoo specifically designed for ferrets from a pet store, or ask your veterinarian. Hold the ferret in one hand or have a helper do this. Work the shampoo into the ferret’s fur gently with the warm water into a lather. You may want to use a grooming brush to do this. Use long soft strokes. Avoid the ferret’s eyes, ears, and mouth.These shampoos are set to a special pH (acidity) balance for a ferret’s skin. Kitten or tearless baby shampoos may also work.
Consult your veterinarian if you need a special type of shampoo such as for a flea condition.
 Use warm water and be thorough. Run the warm water over all areas of the fur.Ensure no shampoo or soap residue remains or you risk drying out the skin.
 Avoid letting the ferret get chilly or near cold air drafts while damp. Use a towel to pad down the ferret’s fur until it’s only damp. Lay the ferret on one or more bunched up towels to allow the ferret to dry themselves by rolling around.Don’t dry the ferret so roughly that you scrape their skin.
 Set the blow dryer to its minimum setting. Hold the blow dryer at least one foot from the ferret. Activate the blow dryer and use it until the ferret is dry.This is an alternative to towel drying your ferret
If you are worried about over-drying then you should use the blow dryer just until the ferret is damp and let them burrow into towels to complete the drying process.

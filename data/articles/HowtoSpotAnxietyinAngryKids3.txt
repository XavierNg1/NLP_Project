 Most children experience anxiety, fears, and anger. However, it may be a problem if it interferes with your child’s life. Your child’s anxiety can interfere with their schoolwork and inhibit their social skills. If this is happening to your child, you should seek help from an expert.If the anger or anxiety is interrupting your life or child’s life, you may need help.
 While you probably will take your child to a pediatrician first, a child psychologist or other mental health professional will be more knowledgeable about anxiety in children and its connection to anger. You can talk to your pediatrician about getting a referral to a mental health specialist.


If you don’t want to go through your pediatrician, you can look for child psychologists in your area. Search online to find one who specializes in anxiety and anger, and then read reviews to help you make your decision.
 If your child’s anxiety and anger are severe, your doctor or therapist may suggest treatment. Generally, treatment begins with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which is a behavioral therapy that helps the child learn to replace negative, anxious thoughts with more realistic and healthier thoughts.Sometimes, CBT isn’t enough to help a child with severe anxiety. If this is the case, the mental health professional may suggest medication.

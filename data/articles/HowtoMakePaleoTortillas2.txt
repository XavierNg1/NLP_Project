 Peel and chop your plantains into cubes that can fit inside of your food processor. You can use a pairing knife to cut through the soft plantains., Puree the plantains down into a batter that will be used for the tortillas. Pulse the chopped plantains on the lowest setting until they are smooth. This should only take one or two minutes., Add the other ingredients and continue to pulse the mixture together in your food processor for around one minute. After you're done, stop the processor and scrape the mixture that's moved to the sides before reapplying the lid and mixing it again. Continue to do this until everything is well-blended and the texture is similar to the texture of hummus., Use butter or a cooking spray to grease a sheet of parchment paper that will lay over your cooking sheet. This will prevent the tortillas from sticking to the sheet while you bake them. You can also use coconut oil or olive oil to grease the parchment paper., Scoop two heaping tablespoons for each tortilla. Flatten out the batter with the bottom of your spoon so that they are 5-6 inches (12.7-15.2 cm) in diameter., Place the baking sheet in your oven for 15 minutes. Keep an eye on the surface of your tortillas to make sure that they don't burn. The tortillas will be done once they are golden brown on the edges. Allow the tortillas to cool for 5-10 minutes before you serve them.You can refrigerate your tortillas for up to 3 to 4 days or you can freeze them.

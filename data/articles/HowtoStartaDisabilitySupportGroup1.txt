 Search online, inquire at local hospitals and clinics and check community message boards for information on groups. Contact the people who run local disability groups to see what their goals and mission statements are.


If there is an existing disability support group that covers the needs you want to meet, consider becoming part of the group or volunteering to be part of the committee. Having more than 1 support group, especially in a small to medium-sized community, may not allow either group to achieve the numbers and helpful services required for a successful long-term program.;
, Some groups deal with general topics like chronic illness, physical disabilities or mental disabilities. Others are based on specific disabilities, such as fibromyalgia, autism, or parenting children with disabilities.
 You will need to devote hours of your time to advertising, promoting, developing and meeting with your support group. Ask yourself if you have enough free time and energy to be the main motivator, especially at the start.
 Although you may not feel you need help, brainstorming with a group of people who want to be in the group will allow you to address more issues than if you organized the group by yourself. This committee can also split work associated with the group and meet regularly to expand the group's efforts.
 It is important to choose whether your group will have health, political, social or other goals. Choose 3 or 4 goals, instead of trying to address all the difficulties of disabilities at once.


Set ground rules after you have chosen your goals. These can expand with time, but it is a good idea to establish any time limits, exclusions and sensitive issues before you start meeting with the group.
 It is a good idea to choose someone who has the disability and also has some experience with counseling, time management and public speaking. Leading the support group is an important job that will determine how helpful the group is to its attendees.

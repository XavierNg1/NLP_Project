 Measure around your waist or hips, wherever you want the top of the skirt to be (we'll call this measurement "X"). Now measure the desired length of your finished skirt (we'll call this measurement "Y").









X = waist/hip circumference; Y = length

The top of trapezoid "A" should equal 30% of 1.5 times your waist measurement "X" after adding 3 inches (7.6 cm) for seam allowances. (Use the formula A = * .3.) A = 36 + 3 = 39, 39 * 1.5 = 59, 59 * .3 = 18

The length of trapezoid "B" should be your desired finished length "Y" plus 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) for seams. (Use the formula B = Y + 1.5.) B = 30 + 1.5 = 32

The bottom of trapezoid "C" should equal 40% of 1.5 times your waist measurement "X" after adding 3 inches (7.6 cm) for seams. (Use the formula C = * .4.) C = 36 + 3 = 39, 39 * 1.5 = 59, 59 * .4 = 24

Make sure to sew with the correct sides of fabric together! Connect the three trapezoids on the "wrong" sides of the fabric, so when you wear your skirt, you won't see the stitches.
 Attach a button and sew a buttonhole where red dots are shown in the previous diagram. The dot on the left should be the hole and the dot in the center panel is the button, so you should sew the button on the inside of the garment.

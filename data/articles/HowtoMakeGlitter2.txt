 Here are two ways to get the shiny paper you need:


Collect and wash brightly-colored sweet wrappers or gift wrapping paper.
You can also lay sheets of tissue paper out over newspaper, and cover completely with clear nail varnish or clear-drying glue. Wait until dry, then repeat until there are two coats on each side of the paper.
 Place two or more wrappers on top of each other, as many as you can still easily cut with your scissors. Cut it into thin horizontal strips, leaving the last edge intact so the paper is still in one piece. Rotate 90ยบ and cut into strips in the other direction. You'll end up with tiny squares of glitter confetti. Store in a closed container, or attach to craft projects with glue.
 Alternatively, you can stick a few sheets of paper into a hole punch and press down to turn it into small pieces. This method is faster, but tends to waste some paper by tearing it or sending it flying across the room.


You can get special hole punches that cut your paper into hearts, stars, or other shapes.

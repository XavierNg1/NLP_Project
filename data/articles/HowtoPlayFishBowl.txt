 Then, pass out a piece of paper and a writing utensil to each guest.;
, The phrases can be anything they want them to be. Tell them to keep in mind that each player will have to guess these phrases at some point during the game.
, During round one, each team will have one minute to guess the phrases in the bowl using rules similar to Taboo. The team should choose a member to go first.


One at a time, each teammate will try to get his or her team to guess the phrase or word on the paper using words or phrases as hints, which cannot be any of the words on the paper. The current player giving hints will continue to try to get his or her team to guess until the timer stops.
Once the timer stops, pass the bowl to the next team and have them repeat the same thing.
Pass the bowl back and forth between teams until each phrase has been guessed.
 This next round will use the same rotation concept as the first. Place all of the papers back into the bow to restart. In this road, teammates will try to guess the paper phrases by having their chosen teammate give them a one word hint as a password to guess the phrase.


For example, if the paper says Jennifer Aniston, the player could say “Celebrity” or “Friends.”

, In the last round, the person will need to act out with motions as hints for the phrase on the paper. They are not allowed to use any verbal aid whatsoever.


For example, if the phrase is “playing basketball” the individual can act out dribbling a ball or shooting it into the hoop. At the end of the round, whoever has the most points is the winner. Make it more competitive by adding in a prize for the winning team.

 Remember that the sugar will dissolve, so you will end up with a little bit less than you think. If you started with 1 cup (225 grams) of sugar and 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water, you will end up with 1Â½ cup (360 milliliters) of simple syrup.If you need more/less simple syrup than that, adjust the ratios accordingly.;
, Turn the heat to medium or medium high, and let the mixture come to a boil. Stir occasionally to help the sugar dissolve.
 This will may take anywhere between 3 to 5 minutes.
 If you are making the simple syrup for a recipe, you can use it as soon as it cools down. If not, read on to learn how to store it.
 If you choose to use a bottle, stick a funnel down the neck of the bottle first. This will make pouring the simple syrup in easier.
 You can now use it to sweeten iced teas, coffees, lemonades, and cocktails. It will last about 4 weeks.

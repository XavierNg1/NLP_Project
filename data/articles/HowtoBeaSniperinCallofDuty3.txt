 Get an interest in becoming a sniper. A good way to do this is to practice burst-firing with assault rifles. They are accurate, have a relatively low recoil, and have a greater range than Submachine Guns.;
, You should try to preferably get one with a telescopic sight, but you don't have to have a scope to be an effective sniper. Since battlefields in this game aren't that big anyway, an iron sight is good enough.


Snipers with low magnification are the best because you have a wider field of aim. A 10x scope would only have a FOA of a few feet. Worse as you zoom in. The scope design will not matter.
 A sniping spot is not the same as a hiding spot. A sniping spot is some cover from enemy fire and a good view of what area you will be sniping.
 Remember the lower the better. Crouching is OK, but if you can go prone (lay down) that is much better. Make sure you can still see the battlefield from your sniping position.
 If you have some degree of practice aiming at the head, then aiming there will always he a one-hit kill. However, aiming at the torso is fine too.


When the target is moving, aim the cross-hair a little to the left/right (depending on where the guy is running). This compensates for the target's speed and the speed of the bullet. It also compensates for some lag that might happen.
This usually doesn't happen, but if you are moving and your target is stationary, aim a little behind the target. This is to compensate for gravity - the bullet will move to the direction of your motion as you fire your gun.

 A fireman's carry is traditionally used to carry someone to safety in the event of an injury. However, if you're not professionally trained, it's a bad idea to interfere with an injured person. You can still use the fireman's carry for fun. To start, have the girl stand directly in front of you so the two of you are standing face-to-face., To start the fireman's carry, shift your weight to your right leg. Put it between the girl's legs. Then, have her drape her right arm over your right shoulder. Place your head under the girl's armpit and wrap your arm around her right knee., Now that you're in the position, squat down. Have the girl lean her body over your right shoulder, shifting her weight onto the right side of your body. Then, take her right hand with your right hand, pulling her torso around your neck., From here, you can stand up. The girl's torso will be draped around your neck, with her legs on the right side of your body. You'll be holding her legs and right hand with your right arm. Her head should be leaning on your left shoulder.


Once again, make sure to lift with your legs over your back.
Due to how weight is distributed, you should be able to carry a girl for a fairly long distance using the fireman's carry. However, the positioning may feel awkward or uncomfortable for the girl. She may ask to be put down if she feels uncomfortable being carried like this.

 Ever tune the color settings on your TV to maximum? The colors start flaring out and running together making details, highlights and shadows hard to pick out. The same happens when too much saturation is in photographs and videos. Lower the saturation or vivid settings on your camera to correct this.


Lowering the saturation can also bring out other next door neighbor colors that the dominating color were canceling out. A red leaf shot under lower saturation will likely reveal nuances of brown, pink and purple.
Don't use high saturation in food pictures. This will result in an unappetizing "glow in the dark" food appearance you wouldn't on an dinner invitation.
However there are times when high saturation can help a picture out. If you photograph a cloudy grey sky with peeks of blue increasing the saturation helps the blue stand out more.
Use different degrees of vividness to help enhance the atmosphere and feeling of a photograph. Many fun and happy events like very fun and festive with higher situation. The opposite can be used with scary cold or moody pictures.

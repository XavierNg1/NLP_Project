 Keep it out of the way of the things you use on a daily basis. Also store other infrequently used items, like gravy boats, out of the way. Wrap dishes to prevent dust and grease build-up if they're left exposed, like on the top of a cupboard., Store it in a hutch with glass doors that will show it off. Put extra pieces that won’t fit in the display in the drawers or shelves of the hutch. You can also use an armoire or glass front storage cabinet for storing china., Put your china in dish storage cases to prevent chips and cracks. Wrap handles on tea cups, and serving and sugar bowl dish lids with cotton or newspaper to further protect them. Add pieces of felt between dishes to keep them from banging together. Don’t forget to label the cases so you can easily find pieces you need when entertaining.

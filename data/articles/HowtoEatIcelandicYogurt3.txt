 This recipe combines various fruits with skyr to create a convenient, nutrient rich drink. If you are a person who participates in athletic activity, this drink might be the perfect thing to help your muscles recover quickly. You'll need:


Blender
Drinking glass
Fresh mango, pineapple, strawberries (¼ cup each)
Ice
Knife (for cutting fruit)
Skyr (at least 2/3 cup), Rinse your fruit under a stream of cool water then pat it dry with a clean dishcloth or paper towel. You can also let the fruit air dry.After it dries, measure out ¼ cup each of mango, pineapple, and strawberries.


Larger fruit, fruit with a rind, and stone fruit will have to be peeled, pitted, and cut into pieces with a knife. Then measure ¼ cup of the pieces.
Feel free to add different combinations of fruit, like blueberries, bananas, and so on to your smoothie to create new flavors.
 Measure and add 2/3 cup of skyr to your blender. Then add your washed and measured fruit, each a total of ¼ cup, to the blender. Last, put in three to five ice cubes. Then seal the top of the blender, plug it in, and press the "blend" button.


Blend your mixture until it becomes the consistency you desire. Blending your drink for longer will make a smoother mixture.
If you cannot find skyr, you can substitute Greek yogurt for a comparably healthy alternative., The pitcher of most blenders disengages from the motor with a simple twist release. Release the pitcher, then pour the mixture into a glass or bottle. Extra smoothie can be transferred to a container, put in the refrigerator, and saved for later.


Generally you can expect your smoothies to stay good, when refrigerated when stored in an airtight container, for 12 hours to a day, depending on the ingredients you've used.
When storing your smoothie, fill its storage container to the very top. Excess air in the container will cause nutrients to oxidize and break down.

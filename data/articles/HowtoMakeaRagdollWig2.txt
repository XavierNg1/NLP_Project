 With this example, the center of the yarn is going on the center of the head -- so double whatever length you want from the top of the hairline to the tip of the yarn.


Arrange them in an orderly pile. You should be able to pick them up with one hand, like a bunch of noodles. But make sure the ends all line up!

, Line up a felt strip as backing through the very middle of the strands and being sewing sections with a back stitch. This will end up being your center part.


Continue sewing until the entire felt strip is sewn onto the strands of yarn. Once you're done, flip it over.
 This will keep the wig in place when it is being worn. Sew it on the end where you began with the felt strip. The teeth of the comb should be facing toward the yarn, not away. Place it directly on top of the felt (when held upside-down), so the comb won't be seen through the yarn.


The comb should be only 3 or 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) wide. It should not be wider than the felt strip. Use one of the comb-like hair accessories that can be purchased in most big box or drug stores.
 You may have some pieces that have magically gotten longer or shorter; trim and style your wig until it meets your expectations.


An easy way to style the wig is to tie each side with a ribbon about halfway down the length of the hair. It keeps it from getting tangled and getting in the wearer's eyes -- and it's cute!

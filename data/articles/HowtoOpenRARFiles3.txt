 To open these files, you must have all the parts. If you are missing even 1, your compression software will not be able to recover the original file.
 This will open the extraction window as if you were extracting a single file. As long as all of the pieces are in the same folder, you just need to hit Extract or Unpack once and the rest will occur automatically.


If one of the files is not located in the same folder, your software will ask you for the location of the missing file when it comes to it in the queue.
When the files are extracted, they will automatically be pieced back together into the original file(s) or folder(s).
 After unpacking, you can safely delete the original .rar archives.

 You’ll need a one-gallon plastic jug (like a windshield-wiper fluid bottle), a cylindrical one-quart plastic bottle (like one used for rubbing alcohol), and one sheet of course sandpaper. You’ll also need an x-acto knife, or a wood-burning tool, and you may want to use a hot glue gun., Cut a hole in the bottom of the plastic gallon jug the same size as the cylindrical bottle. This can be accomplished by using a sharp x-acto knife or a wood-burning tool., Cut the top off the bottle using the x-acto knife or wood-burning tool. Then, using the x-acto knife or wood-burning tool, cut a circular hole in the bottom of the bottle, leaving just an 1/8” lip around the edge., Roll up your piece of sandpaper (with the smooth side out) and place into the cylinder you have created. It should stick out the bottom about 1-2 inches. You can use hot glue to secure the sandpaper, if you like., Slide the cylinder (with the sandpaper) into the plastic jug, leaving only about 3 inches sticking out. Again, you can use a bit of hot glue to seal the opening, if you’d like. Remove the cap from the jug if you haven’t already. This is your finished trap., During the day, go to a beach where ghost crabs are known to hang out and look for a hole. Look for a hole with damp, dark sand around it, as this will indicate that there is a crab inside., Slide the 3-inch cylindrical end of your trap into the crab hole and surround it with sand to secure it. Leave it overnight. In the morning, you can see if you’ve caught a crab!

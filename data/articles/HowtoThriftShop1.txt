 Do an online search to find thrift stores in your area. Make a list of these stores and plan to visit at least two of them. The more thrift stores you visit, the better your chances are of finding something amazing.


Other types of discount shops include yard sales, flea markets, and antique shops. However, these options may not circulate their inventory as often.;
, To find out which days your favorite thrift stores have sales, talk to an employee. Ask them if there is a specific sale schedule for their inventory. Additionally, ask them when new merchandise is put out. If you visit the thrift shop on these days, you will have first pick of the loot.Other sales can include:


End-of-the-month sales
Weekend sales
Sales on specific categories, such as clothing or paintings

, It pays to visit the more expensive thrift stores, even if you don’t live in that area. If it’s a costly part of town, the people in the neighborhood will be more likely to donate newer items.This will increase your chance of getting great deals on expensive items such as:


Nice furniture
Vintage clothing
High-quality kitchen equipment

, Many people are overwhelmed at the affordability of thrift shops and end up buying too much stuff. Avoid cluttering your home by only buying your favorite pieces. For example, if you aren’t sure you love the $1 cat shaped mug, don’t buy it.This rule is especially important for clothing. If you try it on and you don’t absolutely love it, set it aside.

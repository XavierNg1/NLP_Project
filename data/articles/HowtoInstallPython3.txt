 Nearly every distribution of Linux comes with Python installed. You can see what version you have by opening the Terminal and typing python.
 Open the Terminal window and type sudo apt-get install python.


You can also install Python using Ubuntu's Add/Remove Applications app located in the Applications window.
 Open the Terminal window and type sudo yum install python.
 Log in as the root user. Type pacman -S python.
 If you want to use the Python development environment, you can get it by using your distribution's software manager. Just search for "python idle" to find and install the package.
 Now that you have the latest version of Python installed, you can start learning how to use it to program. See How to Start Programming in Python for some tips on learning Python.

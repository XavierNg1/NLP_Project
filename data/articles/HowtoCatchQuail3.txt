 Once you have found your chick, you won’t want to leave its sight. You will probably need a small box and a helper.
 Though they are small, it’s not too hard to find out where they have gotten to.
 Chicks can be just as fast as fully-grown quails so make sure you are quick.


Be gentle and do not squeeze the quail chick, this will harm them and cause them injury.
 Make sure the box has breathing holes and that the chick cannot escape from it.
 Whether the housing is a brooder or with the mother hen, it’s important to put the chick back where it belongs.
 The chick should be able to get through the wiring on the pet carrier whilst a fully-grown quail shouldn't.
 You will probably need a helper and a large book.
 Do not put any other chicks in the pet carrier as they will escape.
 Go to the area you last saw them and look around. If you cannot find the quail try looking in your neighbour’s back yard (with permission). Quail chicks can be fast and they might have travelled a long distance by now, depending on the time they escaped.
 The mother quail will most likely call to the chick and persuade the chick to get inside the pet carrier.
 The chick should be trapped with its mother.
 A good place to take them is indoors, in a brooder or a cage, but before you take them to the brooder/cage make sure that it is secure and that the chick cannot escape any more.

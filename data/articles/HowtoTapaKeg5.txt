Scratches on the inside of your glass can act as nucleation sites for bubbles to form. Thus scratches can cause your brew to lose carbonation. To avoid this, if your glasses have scratches, simply rinse them with water before filling.
If you are using plastic cups scratches are not a problem.



Do not pump for the first few pints.
Just push down on the nozzle. The pressure already in the keg is more than enough to expel your beer.
 Do not worry, when the first pint is all foam. This is normal and beer will follow shortly. However you do want to make sure you deal with the foam properly. Foam begets more foam. Therefore, adding beer to the foam glass will only create more foam and waste more beer. So pour that first foam into a spare glass and let it settle before adding more.
 To minimize the head. Tilt your cup at a 45Â° angle as you first fill. This allows the beer to roll around the cup as it pours. As your glass fills you will return it to a vertical position.
 There is no rule governing how many pumps per pint you need. Instead monitor the flow of beer.


If your beer is expelling too fast and you see foaming, do not pump anymore. Some kegs have a pressure release valve that you can open by pulling the metal ring attached to it.
If your once-steady stream of beer has slowed to a drip. Give your keg a few pumps.

 This all depends on what you fancy. Are you hungry for a burger? Or would you rather order from your local kebab shop? As long as the shop does deliveries, you can pretty much order whatever you like.
 You can usually do this by going to their website or searching for their phone number online. If the shop is local, they will usually post flyers through the door. If they don't have a website, you can also look at one of these flyers to find their number.
 They might not answer straight away if they're busy but just do your best to stay patient.
 To do this, tell them what you'd like to eat. They will usually ask for your address so they know where to deliver the food and sometimes your name. Make sure that they confirm your order so you don't end up with the wrong foods at your door.
 Depending on where you live and where you ordered from, the time you'll have to wait can vary. Usually though, you shouldn't be kept waiting for over half an hour. If you're still waiting, phone them up again and confirm that your order has been delivered. They may have forgotten about it or not finished cooking it yet.
 Some people give small tips to the delivery person. This is optional but they'll appreciate it a lot. If you'd like to give a small tip, tell them to just keep the change.

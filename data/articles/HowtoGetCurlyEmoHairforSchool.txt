 Are you a type 2 (wavy), type 3 (curly) or type 4 (tight springy curls)? Knowing your curl type will help you figure out what styles will look better on you and work for your hair type.;
, Layers can look good on curly hair, and can definitely give you an edgy look. Just avoid short choppy layers. What works for straightened hair will not always work for curly hair.
 Do you want a natural color or crazy color or even both? Some nice combinations are: black and red, blond with black and blue, red with black underneath or blond with black underneath. Just don't dye your hair too much or too often. Curly hair dries out easily, and over processing your hair will cause a lot of damage.
 You can get all kinds of extensions, just make sure they are 100% human extensions or else they will look fake. Clip in extensions are the best option. Make sure your extensions blend in with your hair and are as close to your hair in appearance as possible.
 Anything will look good just don't overdo it except if you want that childish look.
 Also, gel could give you that nice wet look.

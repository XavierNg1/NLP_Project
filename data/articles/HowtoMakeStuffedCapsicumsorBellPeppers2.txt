Stir the ingredients together until you've combined them pretty evenly.
 Just use a spoon to place the stuffing in each pepper. Leave some room at the top for the ingredients to expand a bit. You don't want to over-stuff those peppers or they might explode.

 Sprinkle the peppers with 1/2 cup of chopped chives and serve them with sour cream for an extra kick.

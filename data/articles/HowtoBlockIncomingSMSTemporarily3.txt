 iPhone users may place a single conversation in “do not disturb” mode. While this will prevent you from seeing notifications from the conversation, you will still receive the SMS text messages and be able to view them later.


This feature applies to group and one-on-one messages.
, Find “Details” in the very top, right corner of the screen. It is to the right of the contact’s name.
 Find this after the contact’s/contacts’ information and the “Location” section.
 You will continue to receive texts in this thread but you will not receive notifications.


A crescent moon icon will appear next to the thread in your Messages app.
 Once you turn off “Do Not Disturb”, you will once again receive notifications from this conversation.

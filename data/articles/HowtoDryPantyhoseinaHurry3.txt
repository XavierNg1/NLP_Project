 In a real emergency, and in good weather, you can dry your pantyhose from the window of a moving car.
 Carefully, hold the pantyhose out of your window so that the legs of them are hanging out. Be sure to maintain a tight grip on them so that you do not lose them while the car is in motion. Be sure to do this in a private place, such as a parking lot, where no other cars are passing by., Do not exceed the posted speed limit, but drive quickly so that the wind dries your pantyhose. Hopefully, the sun will be out and can help in this drying process as well.
 Unroll the window, pull on your hosiery while in the car, and check that all is in order. Then, you should be ready to make your grand entrance.

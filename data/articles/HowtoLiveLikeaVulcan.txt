 Vulcans live on a 132º Fahrenheit planet, so it pays to have this step in check.;
, Vulcans still feel emotion, but they do not show it. Start by being quieter and listening more.
 The species you are trying to imitate has a very wide range of vocabulary and can calculate odds in a nano-second! Try to be good or at least more than adequate at mathematics and science. Or specialize in one subject. Try to be extraordinary at everything though.
 This step is very crucial to suppressing your emotions! You may wish to learn to meditate.
, Yes, this may mean giving up watching the series finale of The Walking Dead or your favorite television show for an hour working out, but that is the logical decision! Let logic decide your actions.
 Vulcans believe contractions in sentences are illogical.
 These people are the image of perfection! Complete the image of a true Vulcan with the facial and hair perfection!

, Vulcans are touch-telepaths, meaning they can feel others emotions through touch. If Vulcans feel too much emotion they will break their façade.
 Opt for utensils.
 This species is mainly vegetarian, but will eat meat on the rare occasion that it is necessary.
 Vulcans show absolutely no emotion. This means you must show none also.
 You now act like and live like a Vulcan. Live long and prosper.

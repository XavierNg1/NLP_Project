 With Turabian style referencing, the book, chapter and verse come first, followed, by the version of the Bible you are using. Place a comma between the two.


For example, " 'In the same way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that everyone will praise your heavenly father' (Matt. 5:16, New Living Translation)."

, Though this is a fairly typical way of referencing Scripture, some citation styles prefer periods. However, Turabian requires a colon.


For example: (Matt. 5:16).
 Turabian allows for two sets of abbreviations when citing books of the Bible. The first is a traditional set, the second a shorter version. Pick one and remain consistent. Consider asking your instructor to see if there is a preferred set to use.
 Unless your professor specifically requests it, you don not need to provide publication information for the version or versions of the Bible you use.

 Postage is expensive and putting hard copies in the mail only slows down the process. Send invoices via email or invest in an automated billing system that will email invoices for you and continue to send reminders to the client until the invoice is paid. The client can also pay online., This is an amount paid upfront that you draw down as you complete the work. When that amount is used up you ask the client to replenish before you continue on with the work., Here the client provides a credit card or bank account number and you take what you are owed on the same day each month.
 If you can afford it, this gives you a more professional appearance and makes payment seem more urgent. Even if it's your spouse, who uses another name to make the calls, this way your amiable relationship with the client is not jeopardized by crass calls about money.
 Often, collectors will pay up to 50% of what you're owed, just for the opportunity to try to collect it.

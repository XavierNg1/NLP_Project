 At work, you may be asked to do anything and everything. Be willing to give back and get the work done. But when it interferes with your break time, lunch, or after-work hours, be assertive about your limits as an employee. Help to define your role to others at your work. Ask them to respect your time, particularly when it's off-work hours.
Speak directly, clearly, and concisely. Understand that if you act more confidently when you say, "No, sorry I can't help with that right now," then your wishes are more likely to be respected.
 While it's important that you get along with supervisor, that doesn't mean you need to demean yourself for them. This is even more true for co-workers. Sometimes people just won't like you, and it's okay. You don't need to be liked by everyone, but you need be treated with respect and consideration.
Understand the difference between having a mutually respectful relationship with your co-workers, and one where you're being used by them. If you continually agree to do others' work without anything in return, you will likely feel used.
Focus your time and interactions with other people who treat you with respect.
 If you feel like everyone is asking for your help and time, find ways to redirect the focus. Show them how work is a team effort. You give. They give. Everyone gives in order to make the work run smoothly and fairly.Don't feel overwhelmed by what others are asking of you. Instead find ways to understand what your role is, and how others can contribute to the overall goals of the company.
Don't be afraid to ask for help, particularly if everyone else is asking for some from you. Think about talking with your boss or other co-workers you trust to find solutions that work for everyone. For example, say something like, "I wanted to see about getting some help with this project. Are there any things that you might be able to help with?"

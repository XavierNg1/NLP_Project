 Choose a food from each food group. Serve the food with water or milk on the side.


Try serving turkey sausage, mandarin orange slices, halved grape tomatoes, unsweetened toasted oats, and milk.Try serving scrambled eggs with cheese on top, bell pepper slices, and an English muffin with jam.
Try serving turkey bacon, avocado and strawberry slices, waffles, and string cheese.
 Try making the food visually appealing, for example by arranging it into a smiley face! Let your toddler choose part of the breakfast, for instance the fruit. Serve something interactive, like dippers.For example, try making pancakes and arrange fruit on top to make the pancake look like a cute animal face.
Or, serve cut fruit and yogurt on the side for dipping.
 Eat together as a family, if possible. Turn the TV off so the child doesn’t get distracted. Make sure toddlers aren’t eating snacks or drinks high in sugar in between meals, which can fill them up before mealtime. If there are foods the child is refusing to eat, try disguising them with other foods.Toddlers typically go through fussy eating stages, where they refuse certain foods or meals. If the child is at a normal height and weight and seems healthy, this is probably just a normal part of growing up.
Children tend to eat healthier foods when the whole family is eating together.For example, mash vegetables in with potatoes, or serve minced meat in with a sauce or gravy.

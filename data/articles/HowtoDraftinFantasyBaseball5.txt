 If you don’t, the auto-draft will default to the site’s ranking list. This can be problematic, since each site’s rankings are based on a number of factors that may or may not run in tandem with how you might rank the players. The only way you can ensure that the computer is making choices you approve is to go in and rank the entire list from top to bottom. It is time-consuming but well worth it.
 The sooner you can identify problem areas in your auto-drafted teams, the better chance you have of filling those holes with waiver or free-agent pickups. Those who wait too long will almost assuredly miss out on the top players that weren't drafted.

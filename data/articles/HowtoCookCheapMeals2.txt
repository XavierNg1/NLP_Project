 More often than not, the generic store brand of any given product costs less than the name brand, even though the two products are virtually identical.
 Fruits and vegetables that are in season are priced to sell, so they cost less than produce not in season. For instance, corn-on-the-cob can cost up to ten times more out of season than it does during the summer months, when it is in season.
 Frozen and canned products cost less than their fresh counterparts and are usually just as nutritious. In fact, since these products are picked at the peak of ripeness, they may even contain more nutrients than partially ripe fresh produce. Go with frozen produce for the healthiest option, since it usually contains fewer preservatives than canned foods.
 Fresh seafood can be very expensive. By comparison, canned tuna and salmon are quite cheap, and they also contain high amounts of protein and helpful omega-3 fatty acids., Boneless, skinless chicken breasts are convenient to prepare, but this convenience will cost you extra. Bone-in pieces and whole chickens will save you on cost per serving. You can even remove the bones before you cook the chicken and save them to make stock later on.
 Tougher cuts of meat, like beef chuck roasts and pork shoulders, cost less than tender cuts. Slow cooking these meats using low heat can make them just as delectable, though. Try preparing a stew or slow-cooker meal using these cuts.
 In general, meat can be rather expensive. Eggs and beans are both healthy alternatives that offer high levels of protein at significantly cheaper prices.
 Both products are already fairly cheap. Moreover, they can usually be bought cheaper in bulk and have extended expiration dates. Enhance stews and stir-fries with pasta or rice, or prepare them for a simple side dish.

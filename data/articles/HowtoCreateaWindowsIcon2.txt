 Converticon is a safe, easy-to-use web application that will convert any image to an .ico file (a Windows icon file). The address is www.converticon.com.
 You can use any image type (such as .bmp, .jpeg, .png, and .tif) to begin. Choose something that stands out.
 Click “Get Started” to bring up a list of all folders on the computer. Navigate to the folder which contains your image, select it, then hit “Open.” You’ll see a small version of your image in the dialog box. Because your icon needs to be a perfect square, Converticon may adjust your image to make that possible.
 Click “Export” to open a list of size options for your icon. First, click on “Icon” at the top of the screen. Next, choose a size for your icon. All available sizes are perfect squares. It’s a good idea to choose the largest size (such as “original size”) so your icon is of the highest quality. Windows will scale the icon to a smaller size on your desktop so there’s no need to save a tiny version of a .ico file.
 Click “Save As” to open the list of folders on your computer. Choose a location you’ll remember and click “Save.”

 Consider making a vegan pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving. This pie uses either a soy-based tofu filling or a soy-free filling that uses pumpkin puree. This variation of pumpkin pie is low in saturated fat and is a healthy and tasty dessert for the autumn holiday.


You can also make a traditional pumpkin pie using some of the methods listed above.
 Apples and cranberries are traditional treats to eat during the autumn season. Replace the butter in the recipe with coconut oil or a fruit puree and skip the ice cream to keep it healthy.


You can also bake cranberry orange bread.
 Swap the milk in your fruit custard with almond or soy milk. This will reduce the fat and make it an even healthier holiday dessert. Use healthy fruits and nuts with the custard to increase its health benefits.
 Cake is a perfect way to celebrate the winter holiday. When baking your healthy holiday cake, consider using this recipe and replace the butter and sugar with applesauce. Instead of using the marshmallow spread, use coconut whipped cream.

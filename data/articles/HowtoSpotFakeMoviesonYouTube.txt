 Older movies have a higher chance of having fake videos.;
, If there are other copies of the video that have a different length, it is most likely fake.
 If the video was uploaded a few hours ago, it is almost definitelyÂ fake.
 If the description has a link to some unknown website, it is fake.
 If the video has a picture of a studio logo that doesn't correspond with the film, or if it asks you to go to a website to watch the movie, it is definitely fake.
 If the view count is less than 500 views, it's almost always fake.
 This isn't as efficient as the other methods, but if you see that the video isn't the movie you were looking for, or is a static image, it's fake.

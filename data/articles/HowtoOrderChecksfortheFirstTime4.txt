 Checks should arrive anywhere from one to two weeks. If you need the checks immediately, you can usually pay more for expedited shipping.Whether ordering from your bank or a separate company, your checks usually will take 10-14 business days to arrive. You should get them all at once in a small package.
If you're out of checks and need them immediately, it may be a good idea to pay for faster shipping. You may also be able to to go your bank to get a few checks to get you through until your new checks arrive.
 You also want to write "void" across the check so it can't be used in case you lose it. If you have a check from your previous order, you will have fewer steps to go through next time you need checks.


If you write "void" across your check, it will not be accepted by banks and businesses. You don't want to have a loose check floating around that someone could use in case you lose it.Saving a check will make the ordering process easier and faster. You'll have your routing and account number ready when reordering checks.
 This is especially important so there will not be a time when you don't have them available. When you're down to your last few checks, it's probably a good time to order them.


If you write a lot of checks, you probably should order plenty at first, since it'll be cheaper. About a month before you need new checks, place your order so you will have them when you run out.
Buying checks before you run out will also mean you can shop around. If you want a different style or image on your new checks, you'll have plenty of time to choose one.

 If you already suspect your Labrador retriever is overweight or obese, visit your veterinarian for a checkup. The vet can guide you on the type and quantity of food you should feed your dog, how much weight a month your dog should lose, and your dog’s goal weight.If a health problem, like hypothyroidism, is causing your dog to be overweight you will need to treat the medical condition.
 Sometimes, your dog may gain weight because of a medical condition. Hyperadrenocorticism, also known as Cushing's disease, and hypothyroidism can cause weight gain. Hypothyroidism is a condition caused when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. This slows metabolism down so the dog’s body has trouble keeping weight under control.In addition to gaining weight or difficulty losing weight, a dog with hypothyroidism may become lethargic, may lose hair, and may seek warm places as it feels cold.
Neutering or spaying a dog can also cause weight gain. A desexed dog requires about 10% less calories than an intact dog due to the decreased demands from the reproductive system.
 Overweight and obese dogs are prone to developing serious health problems.Chief among these are developing diabetes.Obese dogs are also at risk to develop painful osteoarthritis due to years of excess weight stressing the bones and joints.


In addition, overweight and obese dogs are at risk for high blood pressure, heart disease, and some forms of cancer.Obese and overweight dogs also have a tendency to be less energetic, sleep more, and to have fewer interactions with their family.

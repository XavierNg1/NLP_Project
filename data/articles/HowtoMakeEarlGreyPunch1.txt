 Place 1 ¼ cups (295.73 ml) of water in a kettle or pot on the stove. Heat the water until boiling, then pour the hot water into a large heatproof bowl., After you pour the boiling water in the bowl, add the Earl Grey teabags or tea leaves and let the tea steep for 5 minutes in the hot water.Don’t steep the tea for longer than five minutes. When black tea is steeped for too long, the tea acquires a bitter taste.
 After the tea has steeped, remove the teabags or strain the tea leaves out by pouring the tea through a fine mesh strainer into another heatproof measuring cup or bowl. Let the tea cool for around twenty minutes., While you are letting the tea cool, add the ½ cup (118.3 ml) honey, 2 sprigs each of thyme and rosemary, and ½ cup (118.3 ml) of water to a saucepan over medium heat., Heat the honey, herbs and water until they reach a gentle simmer. Then turn off the heat and pick out and discard the herbs from the mixture., Pour the tea, honey syrup, lemon juice, cognac, bourbon and bitters into a pitcher or a punch bowl. Then pour in 2 cups (473.18 ml) of ice into the mixture and stir., Serve the punch directly after preparing it so that it’s cold, or place the pitcher of punch in the refrigerator to keep it cool and serve it later.If you aren’t serving it immediately, wait to add the ice until right before you serve it.

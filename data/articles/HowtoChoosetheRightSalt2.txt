 Finishing salts are often more expensive than the other varieties and are typically harvested by hand. These salts can range from crunchy or soft, colorful or dull and can be stronger tasting than other salts. Choose this salt if you want to make your dish extra special.Examples of finishing salts include infused sea salts, sel gris, and fleur de sel.
 Certain finishing salts like Fleur de Sel are expensive and add a unique texture to your dishes. The thin flakes of the salt add a burst of flavor with a light and crunchy texture that lasts for a long time on your tongue. Flake salts are similar in texture but contain less moisture, so that the salty taste doesn't linger on the taste buds.One of the most popular brands of flaked sea salt is Maldon., Adding sea salt or another coarse salt to dishes will add a crunch to the food and will also add more intense bursts of salty flavor within the food. While traditional processed table salt usually dissolves on food, sea salt will often stay intact, which is what gives it a different taste.


Experiment with finishing your food with different salt to see what tastes best to you.

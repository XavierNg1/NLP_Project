, Pedal slightly forward.
 Use your hands to move your body forward over your handlebars; this has the effect of making your bike rock slightly backward in compensation. This is the same principle which makes a rocket move in a vacuum with fuel. Indeed, a stationary man on a rocket in space, if he has a rock, can make the rocket move in one direction by throwing the rock in another direction, or even moving it in that (opposite) direction.

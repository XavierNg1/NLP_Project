 Just like method 1, you must figure out if your four-channel amplifier can be bridged. Taking all the same precautions, be sure to consult the amplifier manual or research your amp model online to be sure it can be bridged., On your four-channel amp, you should see 8 terminals: channels 1 through 4 each have a positive (+) and negative (-) terminal. Each terminal will be labeled as follows:


Channel 1

"A" (positive)
"B" (negative)


Channel 2

"C" (positive)
"D" (negative)


Channel 3

"E" (positive)
"F" (negative)


Channel 4

"G" (positive)
"H" (negative)



,

From the wires coming out of the speaker, connect the positive speaker lead to terminal A (the positive for channel 1) and connect the negative speaker lead to terminal D (the negative for channel 2). Again, just like bridging a two-channel amplifier, connect these speaker wires to the amplifier by unscrewing the screw in that whichever terminal you are connecting the wire to, place the wire in between the top and bottom portions of the terminal, and then screw the screw down tightly to secure the wire.

Once the wires are secured, the first speaker is connected to the amplifier.


Following the previous method, again take the wires coming from the second speaker, but this time, connect the positive speaker lead to terminal E (the positive for channel 3) and connect the negative speaker lead to terminal H (the negative for channel 4).

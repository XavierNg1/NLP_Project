 While your piercing is healing, it needs to stay in your ear. If your piercer chose to pierce with another type of jewelry and then move to a heart later, don't try to change early. You need to keep the jewelry in so it can heal., You should usually clean the piercing at least once a day, and you shouldn't clean it more than twice a day. You can clean it in the shower. Apply a mild soap to the piercing and then rinse it with water. Make sure to get all the soap out., If your piercer suggests it, you can use a mixture of salt and distilled water instead of soap. Add a 1/4 of a teaspoon of sea salt (no iodine) to a cup of warm water (use distilled or bottled). Mix it together until it dissolves. Apply it using gauze or paper towels, soaking the piercing for 10 to 15 minutes., That is, anything that comes near the piercing should be as clean as possible, including your headphones and mobile phone, as well as hats, other jewelry, and glasses. At night, use a clean t-shirt to cover your pillow. You can rotate to a clean side the next night, then turn it inside out. Make sure to change it after you run out of clean areas (the fifth night).It's also a good idea to skip swimming and soaking in hot tubs for about 2 months.
 When you pierce something, you've put a new hole in your body. Even if the piercer is very careful, you can still get an infection after the fact. Signs of infection include redness, swelling, and discharge near the piercing.You'll also likely notice heat and tenderness. If you think you have an infection, see a doctor, especially if it seems to be getting worse. Don't remove the piercing until you see a doctor.Bleeding in the first day or two is normal. Itching and tenderness are also normal. You may notice some whitish discharge that forms a crust, which is also normal.
It's likely that the doctor will have you keep the piercing in, anyway, as taking it out could allow it to heal over the infection. Leaving the jewelry allows it to drain.

 Getting a job is a lot of responsibility, so know what it is that you are getting into.;
, Even if there will not be much on it, your resume will help introduce you to your desired job. Remember not all experience has to have come from a previous job, maybe you've done some writing for your school newspaper or designed websites as a hobby?

, Working in a charity shop or elsewhere for free will gain you experience and increase your chances at getting a paid job.
 It is very hard to be objective about your own experiences, and a fresh eye will help pick up any spelling mistakes or grammatical errors you may have missed. Ideally, ask a friend who has good CV writing skills and literacy.
 Make sure your skill-set matches the requirements and that you can travel to the job.
 You will have a heads up on how they run, which will give you an advantage.
 Even if you end up having to turn one down, it will give you valuable interview experience and make you seem more desirable.
 Make sure you're presentable, not all dressed up, but presentable. 2) You call them and ask them if they have checked out your application. If they say they will and still don't call back in a few days then call and ask again. You can do this about 4 times but make sure you do it at least 3 days apart. This method lets them know that you care and is highly effective.
 If you can only work a specific amount of time, tell your employers straight away and never overly exaggerate your skills.
 Questions such as asking about training opportunities show an interest in the job and an eye for the future that might help set you apart.
 Even if you are told that you do not have to dress up, you should always look presentable.

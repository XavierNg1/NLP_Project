 When you volunteer, you need to make sure to dress for working in a dog shelter. That means you should wear clothes you do not mind getting dirty. If you are working an event, the shelter may want you to wear a shelter t-shirt or nice clothes.Not all volunteer tasks involve being inside the shelter. There may be tasks that take you outside to hand out flyers, walk dogs, or work with dogs in runs. Dress for whatever temperature youâ€™ll be working in.
 Dog shelters can be loud. Most of the time, numerous dogs are barking nonstop. Due to the way the shelters are set up, the barking can sound even louder than normal. If you think this will bother you, get some earplugs to wear while you work., Shelters get many different kinds of dogs. Some of the dogs in these shelters have been abused or neglected, so they are scared. Other dogs may not like being in the shelter or be unnerved by the noise. This means they may act aggressively when around new people.If you are unsure how to approach new animals, ask an employee for help.
Some shelters require you to sign an accident waiver in case of biting, scratching, or other injury.

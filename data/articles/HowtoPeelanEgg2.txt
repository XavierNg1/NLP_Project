 Use the same steps outlined in the basic method to cook and cool the eggs.
 Once the eggs have cooled, take one and firmly tap each end on a hard surface, such as a counter top, to crack the shell. Do one end, and then the other.
 Place the side of the egg on a counter and roll forward for one revolution with your palm firmly down on the top of the egg. You should place enough pressure on the egg that the shell cracks, forming a "web" of broken shell.
 Use your thumbs to peel off a section of the broken shell from the wide end of the egg, and the entire shell should slip off in less than a second.

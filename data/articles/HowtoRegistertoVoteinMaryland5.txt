 If you have changed your name or address since your last registration application was filed, you will need to update your voter registration. The easiest way to do this is online using the OLVR.You will use the online system just like you did when you filled out your original online registration application, except this time you will indicate that you are updating your information.
 You can also notify your local board of elections of any changes by sending in a new registration application. You will fill out the information in the same manner as if you were registering for the first time, except in Section 2 you will indicate that you are changing your name and/or address.Once you have completed the application, you will send it to your local board of elections or the State Board of Elections.
 As a last resort, you can update certain registration information during early voting. If you need to change your address, for example, you can do this by bringing proof of your new address (e.g., driver's license, utility bill, paycheck) with you to the early voting site. However, you cannot change your party affiliation during early voting. This must be done after the election.


If you have changed your name, you will have to vote under your former name but you will be able to fill out a form that contains your new name. Your name will then be updated after the election.

 Unfortunately, kids usually aren’t the best secret keepers. They are often quite loosed-lipped, despite what they may say. Advise your child to keep their secrets to themselves, or else they risk having everyone know about them.

Additionally, tell your child to keep their friends’ secrets to themselves. If their friend trusted them enough to share that information, they should respect them and not tell others about it., If something is bothering your child, they may look to other children for support and help. But telling other children could result in gossip, exposing your child to torment and teasing. Instead, tell them who they can trust to speak with about the issue.For example, you can tell them to talk to you, other relatives, the principal, their guidance counselor, or their teacher. The chances of resolution and having their information stay confidential is more likely if they confide in a trusted adult., Your child could stop gossip before it starts by speaking up to the people who are intending to spread it. Tell them to tell their friends to stop if they believe they are going to start spreading a rumor. Encourage them to find other friends to bring along during the confrontation, as it may make more of an impact and help them feel more comfortable. They can say, “I know you’re about to start gossip. It’s going to hurt the person and it’s wrong, so I don’t think you should.” You may also consider having your child tell a principal or teacher about the potential future gossip to prevent it from getting out.

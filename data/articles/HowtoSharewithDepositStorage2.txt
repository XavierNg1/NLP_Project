 Go to http://depositfiles.com/ and sign in using your DepositFiles username and password.
 From the header menu, click the file cabinet icon to go to your main DepositStorage folder.
 Navigate through your DepositStorage folder directory until you find the folder you’d like to use for sharing and collaboration.
 Identify the folder you want to share, but don’t click or open it.
 Right-click on the folder to bring up a submenu of actions. Select “Share folder” from the submenu options.
 A small window will appear where you can invite users to join and access the folder. Populate the email fields with the email addresses of the people you’d like to collaborate with.
 Beside each of the email addresses, set the user rights or access restrictions for the specific user. There’s a drop-down list to choose from. Select from “Read only,” “Read/Write,” or “Full access.”


Users with “Read only” access can only view and read the files.
Users with “Read/Write” access can read and make changes to the files.
Users with “Full access” have the same access as you or the file owner.
 When done, click the “Done” button. Invitations to collaborate on this shared folder will be sent to the email addresses you’ve specified. Users need a DepositStorage account before they can be allowed access to the folder.
 All the shared folders can be accessed quickly by clicking on the SharedFolders link from the left panel.

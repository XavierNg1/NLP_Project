 If you are concerned about your iodine levels and needs, ask for a check of your thyroid function. Iodine deficiencies can cause enlarged thyroid glands (goiter) and can often be corrected through dietary changes, medication, or iodine supplementation.;
, Excess dietary iodine is secreted in the urine, so iodine levels can be easily assessed through urine checks; some health professionals may request a series of checks to get a more accurate representation of your average iodine levels.


If you are deficient in urinary iodine, your health professional can recommend the best way to address the deficiency.

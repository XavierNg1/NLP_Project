In fact, because of their experience, they might have a different perspective that helps you think about an issue or topic in a new way.If your opinion differs from an older person’s, try not to argue over it. Instead, have a polite conversation where you’re both able to express your points of view, so you can really listen to each other.
 Because of their experience, older people can offer up a wealth of valuable insights, so it only makes sense to use them as a resource. Whether you’re having trouble in school, fighting with your significant other, or unsure what to do with your career, talk to the older people in your life to see if they’ve encountered a similar situation and can provide guidance., Cultural customs, practices and stories are usually passed down generation to generation, so the older people in your family probably have insight into your ancestors that you can’t get anywhere else.

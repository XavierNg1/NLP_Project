 She always has her long golden or white blonde hair styled in a pretty fashion. Of course, you don't have to be a blonde. If you take care of your hair it won't matter what color it is. Barbie is also known for her long, flowing hair. If you, like most people, don't have that, then try some clip-in or weave-in extensions! They're fast and easy, and most of the time are pretty affordable and look great!


If you want to bleach your hair blonde, make sure you have it done professionally! Have your roots redone frequently if your hair is a darker color, since sometimes showing roots look trashy.
If you have roots and can't get rid of them try wears headbands and scarves and hats, wear your hair o cover your scalp, or make some highlights with lemon juice.
 Highlight your hair a lighter shade, so it really sparkles or change hair care products. Vinegar in hair makes it softer and shinier. If you want one or two stress of color, that's pretty. Remember to style your hair in a way that compliments and please you!

,, You don't need Barbie's exact hair as long as the hair that you have is well-taken care of.
 If it is straight, wash it every other day, unless it gets oily very easily. Then, wash it every day

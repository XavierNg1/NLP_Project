 Use a type of body wash that smells good. For example, a cocoa butter shower cream; experts have proved that this chocolaty smell induces feelings of arousal, especially in guys!;
, After you get out of the shower, wash your face with a cleanser, such as "Clean & Clear." Though if you have sensitive skin, you may prefer to try something softer, such as "Nivea" or "Olay." It will avoid irritation.
 Having soft, smooth legs can make you feel sexier and pampered. Use plenty of shaving gel (conditioner works as a substitute) to avoid dreaded shave burns or rashes, or worse still, cuts.
 You have to have clean, white teeth with minty breath. So brush them and use some mouthwash. This helps keep your teeth white and healthy, and you'll taste nice. Don't forget to floss.
 Try not to use a very hot setting as this tends to frazzle hair; the coolest is often the best! Try leaving your hair to dry fairly naturally after rough-drying it, and then dry it with the hair-dryer in order to give your hair volume and shine.
 If you want, use some self-tanner if you think you're too pale. This is by far better than sunbeds, or even naturally tanning, but be careful not to get it streaky or apply too much.
 Choose one to suit your mood. A quick guide is:


Sexy → Musky, deep perfumes
Young → Impulse body spray
Fresh → flowery or fruity fragrances
Fun → watery, fresh smells, such as "Davidoff"

, Try a little mascara and concealer to hide imperfections. Powder your face to even out your skin tone and set everything in place. Look as natural as possible.
 Do what you're comfortable with. Be classy and pretty, but be yourself! Everyone likes a bold and striking girl.

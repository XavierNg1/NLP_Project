 Acidic ingredients like vinegar, wine or citrus juices will soften the tissues of the meat.;
, Avoid using metal bowls because the metal will react unpleasantly with acid.
 Most marinade recipes call for olive oil. Use extra virgin olive oil for the best flavor. Pour one tablespoon (15 milliliters) of oil into your bowl.
 Herbs or spices are the most common choices. Chop 1/4 cup (20 grams) fresh herbs or use 1 teaspoon (2 grams) dried herbs. Also, include about 1 teaspoon (4 grams) salt and 1/2 teaspoon (2 grams) pepper. Use other spices according to their taste and potency. Add your seasonings to the marinade and taste it with a spoon. Adjust your seasonings if needed.
,, Make sure that you turn the tenderloin over so that all sides are coated with the marinade.
 Turn the bag over periodically to allow maximum absorption of the marinade on all sides of the tenderloin.

 If your parents get up early, try to get up with them. Suggest going for a walk. You will all get your day off to a good start, and have time to talk with each other about your plans for the day.


Ask them about their plans for the day too. Don’t spend the entire time talking about yourself. Express interest in their daily lives as well.;
, If possible try to have dinner with your parents most nights. Like taking a morning walk, having dinner gives you a chance to enjoy a meal together and talk about your day.


When your parents ask about your day, don’t be short with them. For example, if they ask you how school was that day, don’t just say, “fine”. Give them details about why it was good or bad. Talk about something interesting you learned, or something funny that happened during the day.
 This is a very small step, but can mean a lot to your parents. Simply telling them that they are important to you, and that you appreciate all the things they do for you can really have an impact.
 After your parents return from work, they are likely to be quite tired. You can offer to bring them something to drink, make them a snack, or even rub their shoulders and/or feet. Even if your parents don’t work, this is still a nice gesture, especially if you can see that they are stressed or worried about something.
 Sometimes it is hard to talk to our parents about things because we think they won’t understand. However, if there is something bothering you or something you are worried about, talk to your parents about it. Not only will this make them feel like they are being included in your life and that you trust them, they may also be able to offer suggestions and advice you hadn’t thought of.

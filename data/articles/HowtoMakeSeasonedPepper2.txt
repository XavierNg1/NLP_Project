 Peel the lemons with a microplane or zester.
 Place in the oven, middle rack, and heat at the lowest level it has.
 Check the dryness every half hour or so.
 Make enough for 2 teaspoons.
 Use the grinder or mortar. Don't make it too powdered; it needs to have some texture.
 Add the cracked black pepper, ground lemon zest, sea salt, granulated or powdered garlic and onion powder to a mixing bowl. Stir to combine.
 Store airtight. Use within 3 to 6 months.

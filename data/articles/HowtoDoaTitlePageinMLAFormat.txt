Note that the very first word of the title should be capitalized, regardless of what kind of word it is.


Do not punctuate your title. It does not need to have quotation marks around it, it should not be underlined, and it should not be in italics. If, however, there is a quotation or a reference to a longer work in your title, that should be punctuated accordingly.

 Sketch in a circle for the head. Then draw two small ovals at each side of the circle for the eyes.






;
, On top of the head, draw two long lines for the antennae. Add two very small ovals at each tip to complete them.
 Draw two ovals, a regular one just under the head and a more elongated one below that to form the tail end of the butterfly.
 For the top wings, draw two large triangular shapes with rounded sides. For the bottom, draw another two rounded triangular shapes but make these much smaller than the ones above. Follow the image as a guide.
 Now this is the fun part. You can either copy a real butterfly's wing design or create something entirely your own!









Add in designs such as ovals and circles. Be sure to mirror what you draw on the right wing on the left wing too because symmetry is the central design feature of butterflies.
 Once it's outlined, erase the guidelines.
 Be creative and have fun with your colors!

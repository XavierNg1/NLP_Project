 Using too much detergent can increase your water usage--if you have big, fluffy suds towering over your sink, you’ll need much more water to rinse those dishes off. Use the amount specified on the label, and add more only if necessary., Instead of washing each dish individually in running water, fill up your sink with water and detergent, turn off the tap, and wash a stack of dishes at a time. Don’t drain or refill the sink unless the water becomes cold, dirty, or loses all its suds., Don’t run the tap over your clean dishes to rinse them off! Instead, fill up the sink or a large bowl with cool water and rinse your dishes by immersing them in the water. You won’t need to refill the rinsing water unless it gets very soapy.
 Put a tray under your drying rack to catch water dripping off your dishes. You can use this water for your plants or for washing your countertops.

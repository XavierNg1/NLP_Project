 If a few don’t, try tightening them – they may not be broken after all. Once you’re confident they work, unravel them. This way you don’t spend minutes unraveling what you don’t use.


Spend a couple of minutes tinkering with them, and then if they still don’t work, throw them out. If you don’t, you’ll just give yourself a headache.;
, You’ll need one 100-light set for every foot of your tree’s height, not accounting for the distance away from the outlet. That number is for a moderately-lit tree; if you like the sparse look or want to go more "sunshine explosion," you may need fewer or more lights.


You should only plug two or three sets together, so make sure to account for that in your length, too. As always, it's better to have more than you need than not enough. Has anyone ever muttered the words, "There are just too many lights on that Christmas tree?"

, Let’s say your tree is 7 feet (2.1 m) tall. If you need 100 lights per every foot, that’s 700 lights, or 7 100-light sets. As mentioned above, you should only plug in 2 or 3 sets to each other (for safety). If your extension cord isn’t enough, consider getting a splitter or a power strip to accommodate all your strings.


We'll be wrapping your tree from top to bottom (or bottom to top, depending on your method) instead of the standard around and around. This generally makes it easier to place your power strip or extension cord in one place and not worry about it.

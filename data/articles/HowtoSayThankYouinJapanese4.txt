"In both casual and polite contexts, this phrase is used in response to thanks. It essentially has the same meaning as "you're welcome."


Pronounce the saying as doh ee-tah-shee mah-she-teh.

In non-romanized form, write the phrase out as どういたしまして。
Informally, instead of "dough itashimashite", you can say "iie", pronounced "e-yeh" written いいえ, which literally just means "no." By doing so, you are just telling the person who helped you "it was nothing,' or "No thank you."

 You need this to use LogMeIn's features and to login from other devices. You can create an account here: https://accounts.logme.in/registration.aspx. With LogMeIn you can do many more things than just control your computer remotely, but some require Pro and we don't want to spend any money on this task.
 To access your computer remotely, it must have LogMeIn installed and it must be open. LogMeIn is open when you see it's icon in your computers' toolbar. Download for mac: http://logmein.en.softonic.com/mac/download. Download for Windows: http://logmein-free.en.softonic.com/download. Always download it for free, you don't really need the Pro version for the feature that we are using.
 Accept everything it asks you, don't be scared if it asks you administrator password: it needs this for security reasons. When it is installed, open it and sign in with your registered account. It will show your computers information, the devices connected to it and more.
 If you need to download it from smartphone, search LogMeIn on your smartphones' store and download it for free. If you are downloading it from another computer, just repeat steps 2 & 3 on that computer.

 This will allow you to put in as many Enhancing cards as you can. (To open your deck, Press P on your keyboard and click on the golden-colored cards on the top right hand corner of your deck page.) The most common enhancement cards include Accurate and Tough. Less common ones include Strong, Giant, Monstrous, and Sniper.;
, In order to make Treasure Cards you must be in battle. To prevent the risk of being killed, do this in Unicorn Way (in Wizard City) or some other easy-leveled place.
 Also keep the card(s) you wish to transform. Once that is done, click on the button near the bottom that says draw and you will draw the enhancement card. The more times you press "discard," the more times you can press "draw."

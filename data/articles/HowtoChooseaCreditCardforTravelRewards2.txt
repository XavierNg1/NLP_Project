 The “catch” to many travel credit cards is the mandatory annual fee, which can range from $50–100.The card company will charge you this fee regardless of how much money you charge to the card, and whether or not you take advantage of the travel-rewards benefits. In order to minimize your expenditure, look for a card with low fees.


If you plan to travel, fly, and stay in hotels a substantial amount annually, you may decide that the annual fee is worth the financial setback.
 All travel cards will require that a minimum amount of charges be made to the card every month, in order for the card to remain open and for the user to redeem their travel rewards. If you’re applying for a travel card for the first time, look for one with a low spending minimum; avoid cards that require you to spend more than $1,000 a month.If you’re an experienced travel-card user, you may want to look into cards with higher spending minimums. These cards sometimes offset the higher minimum with more substantial rewards programs.
Rather than changing your spending habits, look for ways that you can meet the card’s minimum spending requirements through everyday shopping, such as buying groceries and gas for your car.
 If you plan to travel internationally, your travel card may add on an extra transaction fee; 3% is the most common amount. While credit cards usually provide a good exchange rate overseas, a transaction fee can quickly add up on top of your regular travel expenses.Some travel cards dispense with foreign transaction fees altogether. Consider one of these (such as the Capital One Venture Card) if you plan to travel internationally. These cards may also remove other aspects of the rewards program, though, so don’t assume that all travel cards function alike.

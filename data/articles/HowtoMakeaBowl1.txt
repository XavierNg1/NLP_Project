 Ask at your local craft store for appropriate suggestions.;
,,, This should be an even width all the way along its length.
 Keep the coil tight and fitted together.
 This should be sufficient for the base.
 Each length made should be long enough to do one circle of the bowl from this point on.
 To join, simply attach where the last coil ended and blend in the join with your fingers or a small clay spatula.


After adding each new coil, check that it is firmly stuck to the coil below.
 Finish the end by blending into the top coil neatly.
 If adding a pattern, choose something that fits your d√©cor or represents something meaningful for a gift recipient.


Another alternative is to smooth over the outside of the bowl until you can no longer see the coils, then paint over it. Make sure that you do this before the coils dry.

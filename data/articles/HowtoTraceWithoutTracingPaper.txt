 You can find pictures of the things you want to draw, it can be a cartoon, a nature view or even selfies. Just make sure the photos you are printing are in black and white; that way you can see the lines better.;
, Turn the printed image upside down, use a graphic pencil (5B<) and cover up the printed area. You don't have to be super perfect on this.
 Turn the printed image back up, place the image on your drawing surface. You might want to draw a tiny triangle connecting both surfaces, in case you want to adjust the image. Now the shaded side should be facing down. You can use this method on almost anything, from office paper to acrylic canvas.
 Follow the printed image and trace the outlines.
 Remove the printed image to review the perfect tracing.

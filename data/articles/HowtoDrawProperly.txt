 Think of something creative.It can be inspired from a picture, from your memory or from something you are looking at.;
, Crayons, chalk pastels, color pencils, oil pastels, sharpened pencils, erasers and rubbers, etc. Make sure you have everything you are going to use at hand.
 If you are drawing something simple like a vase, always make a thin line, then start the vase's shape.
 Don't press hard on the paper with an incredibly sharp pencil. It will make it easier to rub if you are gentle. When you're done with the masterpiece, you can make it darker.
 Do a proper sketch and over-do the lines a bit. If you are copying the picture from the internet then look at every inch of the picture. Okay, the corners are a bit edgy and the top of the vase is perfectly straight. Got all that? Okay, now draw it!

, Nobody can draw when they are feeling unhappy or angry, etc. It will ruin their work.
 Color inside the lines, or if you're using something with a knobby point like crayons or oil pastels, then color properly inside the shape.
 Paints should be used with a soft brush.
 To have more fun, use things like a soft toothbrush or a sponge dipped in paint. For more ideas, look for Art Attack.

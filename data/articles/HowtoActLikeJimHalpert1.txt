 Jim's signature look is a mop-like, shaggy 'do. This tightens up for a bit at the end of season three, but ultimately remains unkempt until season six, when Jim adds a classy edge to his signature messy hair.;
, Jim wears light colored dress shirts with simple, plain ties. Early on, Jim wore flannel ties, which is a "hand-me-down" look. He always wears dress pants with his dress shirts, and while he was co-manager, Jim wore slim-cut suit jackets as well. Out of work, Jim is seen wearing classic white briefs, athletic clothing, and most frequently, jeans and a sweater.
 Jim's common accessories are his brown/black watch (left hand) and his messenger bag (instead of a briefcase or backpack). Jim also uses regular yellow pencils, but prefers a pen. His custom mug is white with a red diamond pattern that says "Grandma Is A Great Cook." Jim has a Macbook, but this only makes several appearances in the show.

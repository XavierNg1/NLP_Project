 This gives you the moment for each object. Here's how to multiply each object's distance from the datum by its weight:


The see-saw: 30 lb. x 8 ft. = 240 ft. x lb.
Child 1 = 40 lb. x 1 ft. = 40 ft. x lb.
Child 2 = 60 lb. x 15 ft. = 900 ft. x lb.
 Simply do the math: 240 ft. x lb. + 40 ft. x lb. + 900 ft. x lb = 1180 ft. x lb. The total moment is 1180 ft. x lb.
 Find the sum of the weights of the seesaw, the first child, and the second child. To do this, add up the weights: 30 lbs. + 40 lbs. + 60 lbs. = 130 lbs.
 This will give you the distance from the datum to the center of gravity of the object. To do this, simply divide 1180 ft. x lb. by 130 lbs.


1180 ft. x lb. รท 130 lbs = 9.08 ft.
The center of gravity is 9.08 feet from the datum, or measured 9.08 feet from the end of the left side of the see-saw, which is where the datum was placed.

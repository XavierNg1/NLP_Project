 Over-the-counter painkillers such as Ibuprofen, paracetamol, or aspirin can be used to relieve pain and swelling. All of these medications work by inhibiting the production of chemicals called prostaglandins, which cause inflammation. The recommended dosage for each of these drugs is as follows:


Ibuprofen (or similar generic drug), 200 â€“ 400 mg tablets, with or just after food, up to three times a day
Aspirin, 300 mg tablets up to four times a day
Paracetamol, 500 mg tablets up to three times a day
Do not mix these medications. Overdose can lead to serious side-effects.;
, Until professional medical assistance is obtained, lying on your back and supporting the testes in whatever way feels comfortable can help to relieve physical stress and discomfort.


You can also enhance your scrotal support, such as a jock strap. This can aid in relieving testicular pain by protecting the region against contact friction between your legs, painful movement of the scrotum, and external contact that can lead to irritation., In case there is a sudden onset of swelling and pain, gently apply an ice pack or a bag of frozen vegetables to your testicles to help relieve pain and swelling.


Applying an ice-pack is an important measure since, if the cause of the swelling is serious, it can increase the amount of time the testicles can survive without a blood supply.Wrap the frozen ice or bag of vegetables in a dry cloth before applying to protect from frostbite.
 Allow time for the testicles to naturally heal by avoiding activities that could aggravate the pain and swelling. Avoid heavy lifting, running and other vigorous exercises.


If total rest is not possible, then wearing supportive undergarments and/or a truss can be beneficial.

 Start filling your sink, bucket, or other container with warm water and add a few drops of mild laundry detergent. Place your snake in the water. Let it soak for at least 15 to 20 minutes. For especially dirty or oily snakes, give it 30 to 40 minutes., First, spin the snake around in the water to dislodge any loose dirt or oil. Then use a microfiber cloth to rub the braided floss part of the snake. Finally, use a toothbrush to gently scrub the bronze bore brush. Repeat as needed to remove all dirt and oil. Then rinse it under running water to remove all traces of soap., Use your non-dominant hand to hold the snake by one end so that it dangles over your sink, bucket, or other container. Use your dominant hand to gently squeeze the water out from top to bottom until you reach the bore brush. Skip that part and then continue in the same fashion for the rest of the snakeâ€™s length., Use a clean, dry cloth to pat the snake down. Sponge out as much water as you can. Then hang it over a drying rack or clothes hanger, or pin it to a clothesline to air-dry.

 Think "Why am I giving this number out? So that my phone fees may cost higher? Or so that I will be manipulated by text spams?".;
, When giving that out, you're potentially welcoming bandits to go to your house when you're not home and steal something (especially if you're someone who posts about your everyday plans, like "I'm going to Disneyland from May 1-3"; then someone may possibly break in.)

, If someone knows where you live and when you work, you're in big trouble.
 Your name and birthday could also be harmful to your credit card. If the thief knows your birthday, name, security number, etc., they could make a fake cardÂ that charges you.
 Email address and friends on whatever media could also be dangerous, because "You shouldn't talk to strangers"- in person or online. You might receive unwanted emails or spam.

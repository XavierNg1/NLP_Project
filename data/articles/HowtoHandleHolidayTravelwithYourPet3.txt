 It is important that you are respectful of other guests at your holiday destination. This means you need to be aware of your pet and its behavior at all times. You should stop barking, meowing, or chirping immediately and pick up all pet waste. Never leave your pet unattended in your hotel room. If you need to go somewhere your pet is not welcome, you should take your pet to a kennel for the duration of your day trip.
 If at all possible, you will want to bring your pet's bed with you to your holiday destination. You will want to make sure your pet feels at home during your holiday, and bringing along its bed will help ease the uneasiness that comes from being in a new or foreign location. If you can't bring your pet's bed, make sure you at least bring a familiar item, such as a blanket, that your pet can rest upon for the holiday.
 Your pet will be in a location that is not its home during your holiday travel. This can result in anxiety, uneasiness, or even excess energy. Bringing along your pet's favorite toy can help soothe frayed nerves and can also help your pet work out some of the pent up energy that it acquired from your road trip or the plane ride to your holiday destination.
 When traveling with your pet, it is important that you bring along enough food and snacks for the holiday. It is not wise to attempt to buy pet food once you reach your destination. You might not be able to find your pet's usual brand of food, and abruptly changing your pet's diet can wreak digestive and emotional havoc on your already disoriented pet.

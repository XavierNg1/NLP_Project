 Many problems regarding fractions involve determining if two fractions are equivalent. By calculating this number, you can begin putting the fractions in the same terms to determine equivalency.


For example, take the fractions 4/8 and 8/16 again. The smaller denominator is 8, and we would have to multiply that number x2 in order to make the larger denominator, which is 16. Therefore, the number in this case is 2.
For more difficult numbers, you can simply divide the larger denominator by the smaller denominator. In this case 16 divided by 8, which still gets us 2.
The number may not always be a whole number. For example, if the denominators were 2 and 7, then the number would be 3.5.
 Two fractions that are different but equivalent have, by definition, numerators and denominators that are multiples of each other. In other words, multiplying the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same number will produce an equivalent fraction. Though the numbers in this new fraction will be different, the fractions will have the same value.For instance, if we take the fraction 4/8 from step one and multiply both the numerator and denominator by our previously determined number 2, we get (4×2)/(8×2) = 8/16. Thus proving that these two fractions are equivalent.

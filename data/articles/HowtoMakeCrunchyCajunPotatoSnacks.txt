 Cut the potatoes into thin slices. The thinner they are after you cut them, the more quickly they will cook. They will also turn out a bit crunchier.;
, Be sure to use enough to lightly cover the base of your frying pan.
 Just a few pinches will do, just to flavor the oil.
 Try to space out the slices so that they don't overlap. This allows them to cook evenly for the best results.
 Lightly add Cajun to the potato slices evenly.
 Just like a pancake, it's now time to turn over the slices so that both sides are cooked. Check that the first side is golden/brown and slightly crispy then turn them over.
 You may need to flip the slices a few more times to get the desired result.
 This allows any excess oil to drain off of the slices and can later be discarded.
 Letting the slices cool down can make them even more crunchy and can then be put in a box or bag as a little tasty snack!

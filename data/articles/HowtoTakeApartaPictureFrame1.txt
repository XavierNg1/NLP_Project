 Slide bar poster frames can be disassembled from the front or back of the frame, but either way, you need to work carefully to avoid damaging the plexiglass front.;
, Pinch the top bar between your fingers and pull it straight out. Repeat with the bottom bar, as well.


These slide bars are usually made from plastic and only held on by pressure. As such, you should be able to pull them off the sides of the frame without the use of additional tools.
 Grab one of the side bars with your fingertips and slide it along the edge of the frame until it completely comes off. When finished, repeat this step with the other side bar, too.


You may also be able to pull these two side bars off the frame in the same way you pulled off the top and bottom bars. Since the side bars are usually longer than the top and bottom ones, however, it might be easiest to slide them off instead of pulling them off.
 Once the slide bars are gone, only the cardboard backing and plexiglass front should remain. You should be able to simply lift one away from the other to finish taking apart the frame.


Note that if there's a picture inside the frame, you can remove it after separating the backing and plexiglass.

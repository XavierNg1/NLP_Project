 Place the tapered end of the aspirator into your baby’s nose. The tapered end is connected to a long, cylindrical tube that will collect the mucus from your baby’s nose.Make sure not to stick the tube too far into your child's nose. Place it just inside the nostril.
 At the other end of the tube is a mouthpiece that you place into your mouth. With the piece securely between your lips, suck on it to pull mucus from your baby’s nose. The intensity with which you suck will control how much suction is in your baby’s nose.The mucus will not be sucked into your mouth. The tube in your baby’s nose has a filter that will keep any mucus and germs from getting into your mouth.
 Once you are finished cleaning your baby’s nose, you need to clean it. Take it apart and wash the main tube, the nose tip, and the mouth piece. Use hot soapy water to wash the parts. Rinse well to make sure you’ve removed all of the soap.


Don’t wash the long tube that connects the mouth piece with the main tube. If you need to wash it for some reason, or it get water in, make sure to let it dry completely.

 It can take a long time to spot meteors. Bring a lawn chair or some other outside furniture to lay back on. This will help you be comfortable while you wait to catch a glimpse of the Leonids meteor shower., Being out all night in mid-November might get cold. Be sure to pack a blanket or sleeping bag to cover yourself up. Building a fire for heat will produce too much light and prevent you from seeing the shower., Most skywatchers take a break every hour or so. This gives you a chance to stretch your legs and refuel. Bring some coffee or tea and a few snacks to keep you in it for the long haul. You will have to travel away from city lights and the convenience of just going to the kitchen for a snack., If you can't make it out to watch the Leonids meteor shower, you can stream it online. Some astronomy websites, like space.com, stream the shower. This makes it easy for anyone who can't get away from the city (or don't want to) to watch the Leonids meteor shower.

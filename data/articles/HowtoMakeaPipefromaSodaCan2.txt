 If you want to make a water-pipe or bong-style pipe to smoke out of, you'll need:









Two 12 oz cans
Tape
Can opener
Scissors
A trumpet mouthpiece or glass slide
Water

, After rinsing and drying two 12 ounce (340Â g) cans, you'll want to use the can opener to remove both ends of one can and the top end of the other can. Use the can opener as you normally would to open a can of soup. Now, you should have one cylinder with both ends removed and one with no top which will act as the base.
 Cover it with tape to make sure you can't get cut on the edge. You will place your mouth on this end.
 On the side of the can, poke a hole large enough to fit the stem of the mouthpiece or whatever you plan on lighting your smokables in.









Try to make sure you round out of the edges of the hole. You can cover it with plenty of layers of tape.
 Connect it with tape. Spend some time building up the tape layers so it'll fit snugly.
 Tape both cans together to create the full chamber of the water pipe.
, To smoke, fill the mouthpiece with whatever you're planning on smoking and inhale through the top of the top can. When the chamber fills with smoke, remove the mouthpiece when you want to inhale.

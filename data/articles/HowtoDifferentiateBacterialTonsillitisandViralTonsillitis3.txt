 The rapid strep test can be done quickly in your doctor’s office with a throat swab, and it tests for the streptococcus bacteria that cause strep throat. These tests are not always accurate, and can show inaccurately negative results a third of the time.This is a good first test, but a throat culture is often required for accurate diagnosis.
 The most accurate way to determine the cause of your tonsillitis is for your doctor to check the results of your throat culture. This is when your throat swab is sent to the lab and a lab technician determines what, if any, bacteria are present on your tonsils. Then your doctor can prescribe you the right antibiotics to treat the cause of your tonsillitis., Mono can only be diagnosed with a blood test. Because it’s a virus, mono will pass on its own — stay hydrated and get a lot of rest. You should still see your doctor for diagnosis if you have symptoms of mono because mono can cause an enlarged spleen, which can rupture if you overexert yourself. Your doctor will explain what you need to do in order to stay safe and get better.

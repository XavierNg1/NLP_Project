 Heartsease flowers are best harvested in the spring. Pick the entire aerial portion of the flower (i.e. all parts of the flower that are above ground and exposed to the air). Gently remove the petals one by one., Fill a medium-sized bowl with cold water. Scatter the petals into the bowl. Let them chill for 5-10 minutes until they swell up slightly. Remove the petals from the bowl and place them on a paper towel for several minutes to dry, then use them immediately., Use petals to garnish salads, soups, vegetables, or other dishes. Use the petals as soon as possible, as they will deteriorate quickly. If you do not use heartsease petals within a week after harvesting them, freeze them for future use., While heartsease petals are non-toxic and have numerous medicinal properties, they should be consumed in modest quantities. Eating large quantities of the flower, especially if you are consuming it for the first time, may cause digestive upset. Introduce heartsease as a small garnish on other foods, then work up to eating more of it.

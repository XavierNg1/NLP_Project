 At the bottom of the page, there should be a link that says Contact Us.Click on that link to be taken to the contact page, and see the different ways that you can reach out to Max Factor, including using their help center.
 If you have a question about a particular product, makeup tool, or general makeup question, enter the topic phrase into the help center text box. For example, if you had a question about mascara, you would type, “mascara” into the text box, and you would receive search topics such as: “Is it okay to use mascara with contact lenses?” and, “In what order should I apply makeup?”If you were wanting to each Max Factor to answer a basic makeup question, the help center might be able to help you find your answer.
 If the answer you’re looking for doesn’t appear after your first search, consider rewording your topic. For example, if searching for “mascara” isn’t working, consider searching, “eye makeup,” or “eyelashes.” These other search terms may elicit different results.

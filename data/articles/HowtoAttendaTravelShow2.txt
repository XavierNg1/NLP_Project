 Practically every vendor at a travel show will offer some combination of special travel deals, discounts, prizes, giveaways, and raffles to draw in visitors. You won’t have time to visit every booth, so use the website to identify discounts and deals that interest you. That way, you can map out and target your visit so you have a chance at the most appealing discounts and freebies.The website and/or your ticket packet should also include a floor map of the show; use it to mark your route so that you can hit all the booths you want to visit.
 Although your main focus should be on tracking down awesome travel deals and entering drawings for great cash or travel prizes, that doesn’t mean you need to ignore the more run-of-the-mill free stuff. As with other types of trade shows, you can fill up on an assortment of logo-emblazoned pens, mouse pads, keychains, frisbees, and the like.Don’t weigh yourself down too much with freebies, or waste time better spent elsewhere. But if you could use another “can cozy” to keep your favorite canned beverage cold, why not grab one?

, Some travel show visitors avoid talking to the vendor reps because they assume they’ll just get a never-ending sales pitch for the “vacation deal of a lifetime.” You may run into some of this, but you will also find reps who are knowledgeable and enthusiastic. Talking to them can really help you decide between vacation destinations, or choose where to stay or what to do at your dream destination.

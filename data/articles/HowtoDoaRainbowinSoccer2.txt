 You can use the rainbow to switch the direction of the ball right when a defender is trying to steal it.
 This is important because if you don't lean forward, the ball will go backwards.
 The ball should now be positioned between your feet, ready for the rainbow technique to begin.
 Use a motion that will cause the ball to roll off the leg at the knee and drop down toward the heel.
 Do this as you land on your dominant foot. The ball should arc up and over the defender, and they will likely be confused about where it went, and you can run around the defender and continue moving with the ball.

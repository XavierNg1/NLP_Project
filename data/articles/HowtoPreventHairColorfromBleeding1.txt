 During the dyeing process, coat lighter hair in conditioner to protect it. The conditioner will act as a shield when you rinse the dye itself out, lessening the unwanted contact that the dye has with your hair., Washing it too early can dislodge the coloring agents. Though it wouldn’t affect the vividness of your dyed hair too much, those colors can easily find their way into the parts of your hair where you don’t want them., Unless you’re ready to take all your showers cold, you’ll need to start washing your hair over the sink in cold water. During shower time, wear a cap or pin it up out the way to ensure it doesn’t get wet in the hot water. Hot water opens up the cuticles in your hair and lets some of the dye out; run-off here will be particularly noticeable when you’re trying to keep the colors in your hair separate from one another.,


If your hair’s getting too dirty with fewer shampoos from fewer showers, try out a dry shampoo to keep your hair clean in those interim periods.

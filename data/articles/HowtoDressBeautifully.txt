, Be creative and turn a boring solid pink shirt into something adorable! Add bracelets, necklaces, rings, earrings, shoulder bags, you name it!

, You don't want to go out there to show the brand new wardrobe change and not show that your proud of it! Straighten your shoulders, and walk with your head held high!


Shake it girl! Today is when you go out there and show them what you got!






Flirt! be one of a kind and show them boys your stuff! Go out there and be your best self!







, If you think that what you're wearing is too revealing or just plain uncomfortable always change the outfit. You can't have fun when you feel uncomfortable.
 Every outfit looks terrible if you don't smile. It's like that cherry on ice cream . You will not look confident, and that will just make you look bad.
 If you want to dress beautiful, your shape needs to look beautiful. This doesn't mean that you are to starve yourself. Just exercise and eat healthy. Jogging, rollerblading, and riding a bike are very good ways of exercising.


You might want to try not to eat when you are not hungry> Some people eat when they are not hungry, just because they are bored. FYI: if you eat when you are not hungry your body actually produces more fat because it needs to do something with those calories.So it would be better NOT TO EAT when you aren't hungry.
 You can get the dotting tool at almost any craft or dollar store. For the stamps you might want to go to pampering places such as bed bath and beyond and check if the stamping kit is there. Again for the brushesyou might want want to get them at a craft store.

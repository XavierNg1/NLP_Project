 What people do or don't do on their birthdays should not be a measure of your worth. Big party or no party, it's about remembering the good things that you have. Avoid dwelling on what you don't have and focus on the good things.Don't measure your worth by how many calls, texts, or cards you receive on your birthday. Limit your expectations of how you think your birthday should be.
Think about the people who have supported you, rather than those who have hurt you.
Think about three good things that have happened to you in the last year. Focus on even the smallest positive things.
 You only have one life. Think about how wonderful it has been to be alive, no matter if you are turning 15, 25, 40, or 60. You were given life on this Earth, and you have made it this far. Be proud that you have this opportunity.


Your life is just one life among many. You are not alone even if you're feeling lonely.
Keep the motivation to move forward and live your life well as you enter another year.
 There are various reasons why people become depressed on their birthday. Take action to make a new start. Answer these questions to help you understand what may be bothering you:


Do you feel depressed or anxious when reminded of your age?
Did you have bad experiences as a child related to your birthday?
Do you have certain expectations that aren't being fulfilled?

, Don't focus in whether you have achieved your goals by a certain age. Birthdays can be reminders of what you want to achieve by 18, 30, or 50. You may see others who are "doing better" than you. But this feeling is just a perception of yourself. Your goals are yours and no one else's. Avoid comparing your life to someone else's. We each have our own trials and errors in life.
Don't give up on your goals. Your age does not define your goals--you do.

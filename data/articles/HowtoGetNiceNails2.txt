 Every few weeks, you should trim your nails using nail clippers or a nail scissors. If you're growing long nails, be sure to file the edges once a week to keep cracks from forming.









Don't trim your nails too short. Leave at least a sliver of white crescents on your nails. This will let them grow stronger and result in a much prettier manicure.
 Use a nail file to smooth away any rough areas at the tips of the nail. Only file in one direction using a light motion. Try not to make them too round, because that puts you at risk for getting ingrown nails! Using a crystal file can cause less damage than rougher grained sandpaper files.









Don't file using a back and forth motion. This weakens your nails and rips up the fibers. Instead, file in only one direction, being careful not to apply too much pressure.
 This will soften them up so you can push back your cuticles and file them. Soak them in warm water. You can add a little oil if you'd like, to help soften your nails and cuticles. Be careful not to do this too often, wet nails expand and shrink when dry, this can cause cracks to form over time.
 Use a nail buffer to buff the surface of your nails. Start with the coarsest side of the buffer, then move to the finest. Your nails should be shiny when you're finished.
 Use a cuticle pusher to gently push the cuticles toward the nail beds. Don't push them back too much, and take care not to rip or tear them. Never trim your cuticles with a cuticle trimmer; this leaves an open wound at the base of your nails, making you prone to getting an infection.
 When your nails are the desired length, just file or clip the nail every now and then to maintain its shape and stop the nails from growing too long.

 Buying and registering the domain yourself will prevent web development or web design companies from owning your domain from a legal standpoint.


Verify that the domain registrar has legitimate contact information. This will allow you to work directly with the registrar if issues ever occur with your domain.
Review the terms and conditions of the domain registrar to verify whether they have professional legitimate business practices, and to verify the steps for renewing the domain or transferring the domain to a different registrar in the future.
 This will allow the registrar to contact you if any issues occur in regards to your domain.
 In most cases, buying a domain directly from an Internet domain registrar will cost between 5 and 12 dollars (3.95 and 9.49 euros) per year.


Add a privacy feature to your domain package, if available. Adding privacy to your package will prevent your personal information and contact information from being published publicly on the domain registrar's website. In most cases, the privacy feature costs an additional 1 or 2 dollars (0.79 or 1.58 euros) per domain.

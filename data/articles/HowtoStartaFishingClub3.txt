 If you seem put out, disinterested, or dull when discussing the club, it will be difficult to elicit a positive response from those who wish to join. Be sure to express your excitement at the prospect of sharing fish tales with a group of peers, and be open to suggestions on how to make the club better.
 Be firm with the date unless there is overwhelming interest in changing it to something everyone else can agree upon. If one or two people cannot make the meeting, tell them you’ll fill them in on the specifics and invite them to attend the next one. Make sure you give each interested party enough advance notice that keeping his or her schedule clear will be as easy as possible.
 Between an opening speech, “mission statement” (if you opt to create and share it), introductions, and a few ice breaking fish tales, you'll have no shortage of things to do on the first night. Make sure everyone takes the opportunity to share a bit about himself or herself, and encourage the attendees to talk about something fishing-related to help create familiarity.

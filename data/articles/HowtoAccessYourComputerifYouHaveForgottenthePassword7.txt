 Once your recovery key is downloaded, enter a new password for your local computer account. Once the password is changed, click “Restart” to reboot the computer. When the computer comes back up, you’ll be able to log in with your new password.
 If you see a message that says something like “the system was unable to unlock your login keychain” (it might be different wording on different versions of OSX), click “Create New Keychain.” Follow the prompts and you should no longer see that message. If no Keychain message appears, you should manually create a login keychain by navigating to the Applications folder, selecting “Utilities,” then “Open Keychain Access.” Click “Preferences,” then “Reset my default keychain.”

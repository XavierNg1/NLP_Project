 Choose a flat base layer which has good strength to it and looks pretty. A silver platter, a favorite dish, etc. are nice choices.
 They can be the same size or different. If different, the smaller stand sit atop the larger one.


If you want to make the stand complementary with a table theme or your favorite tea set, etc., you'll need to be a little more picky about the colors and patterns of the stands and base layer. If in doubt, plain white and plain metals are safe choices. (But nobody much minds eclectic placement when the stands are pretty and have heirloom quality.)

, This is easy and fast:


Assemble in place, so that you don't have to move the cupcake stand once put together.
Place the base layer down. If using doilies underneath, make sure the doilies are already securely in place.
Place the first cake stand on the base layer. Center the stand's leg in the middle of the base layer.
Place the next cake stand on the first cake stand. If using different sizes, this should be the smaller of the two. Again, center it.
Fill with cupcakes, using the base layer and the two cake stand layers.
Done. It will look wonderful but don't be surprised if the cupcakes steal all the attention!

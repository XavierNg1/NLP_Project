 Avoid douching or washing your vagina with anything more than clean, running water. Using soap or other substances can disrupt the natural pH levels in your vagina.You should try to get in the habit of showering and washing your vaginal area after you have had sexual intercourse to prevent someone elseâ€™s bacterial from sitting in your vagina.
 Wearing underwear that is made of a breathable material like cotton can help to prevent the growth of fungus and bacteria in your vagina. Avoid underwear made of synthetic materials and try not to wear panty hose or tight jeans. You should also change out of wet swimsuits and sweaty gym clothes right away.If possible, you should try to go commando, or without underwear, when you can. Wearing a long skirt with no underwear can let air get into your vagina and reduce your risk of yeast infections.
 Using birth control that is estrogen-based, such as combination birth control pills, can lead to a higher amount of yeast in your vagina and make you more prone to infections. You may opt for non-estrogen methods like progestin-only mini pills or an intrauterine device (IUD).If you use condoms as your birth control method, go for condoms that do not contain spermicides, as they can irritate your vagina. You should also use a lubricant that is water-based during sex to prevent friction or irritation, as this can disrupt the ecology of your vagina.

 Have your toddler close his eyes and count to ten while you find a place in the room to hide. If your toddler can’t count all the way to ten, you can just yell that you’re ready when it’s time for them to look for you.


Make sure to hide close by. Toddlers are at the stage in their development where they want to explore and socialize but they can experience separation anxiety if you’re too far away. They need you to be their “home base”., Your toddler is learning to explore their surroundings on foot. The freedom of being able to walk around is new to your toddler. Playing a simple game of peekaboo may not excite them as much as being able to personally search for you.


Your games of peekaboo should become more interactive as the child grows. The child should be able to experiment with the new skills they learn as they mature. Hide and seek is an evolution of peekaboo that allows the child to use their new-found mobility.
 Congratulating your toddler for finding you serves as positive reinforcement for them. It teaches them to get excited about searching out answers.As they grow, they’ll look forward to solving more complex puzzles.
You want your toddlers to take pride in finding you so that they’ll take pride in meeting other challenges later on in life.
 You toddler is at a place in their development where they’re starting to seek out social interaction. Teach them to play with other kids at an early age so that they grow up well adjusted socially.


Set up play dates with other families with toddlers.
Make sure to stay close by to keep an eye on the toddlers.

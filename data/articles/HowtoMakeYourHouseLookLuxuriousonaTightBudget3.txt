Lighting is a functional necessity that effectively effects the mood and tone of any room.
Best to install a dimmer on overhead lights to control mood lighting.



Foyers determine the first impression of the home. A centered chandelier provides a warm welcoming aura around a house.



A bedroom for example can not accommodate a chandelier as large as one that fits in a foyer.
Make sure the size of fixture is proportional to room size to avoid clutter, awkwardness and an eyesore.

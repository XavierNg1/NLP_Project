 At this stage, your child already most likely understand that you must work to earn money. However, your child might still be unaware that financial loss can occur, such as when you invest in a stock that ends up causing you to lose a lot of money.


Let your child experience financial loss and earn from his mistakes. If your child decides to spend his money on chocolate, rather than on something more sustainable, and then expresses regret later on, discuss the concept of financial loss at this time.
 Be open with your child about your family’s current financial status. Be honest about the things that your family can afford and what sort of limits you have. Being open with your child can help him to figure out his own place in your family’s financial situation.


You should also try to practice what you preach. If you want your child to save money wisely, you should also save money to set an example for your child.
Show your child your family’s bills and teach him how to read them, and about the process of paying bills.
 While it is important to follow child labor laws, a job could simply involve raking your neighbor’s yard every week. Explain the concept of part-time jobs like babysitting, car washing, or lawn mowing.


However, be sure to encourage your child to stay in school, and remind him that school is a very important part of finding a great job later on.
 Give your child more responsibility and more chances to earn money. This could involve increasing the number or difficulty of your child’s chores. When (or if) your child gets his license, you could also extend your child’s chores to running errands for you.


Consider giving your child stored-value cards. You can also help your child learn about financial responsibility by giving him stored-value cards. This looks like a credit card but only has a fixed amount of money on each card.

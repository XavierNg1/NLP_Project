 Try wearing affordable clothes that are in style.;
, Shower every day and wash your face with cleansers and scrubs. Use body scrub that makes you smell good, and keeps your skin soft. If you are busy and barely have time in the morning, take showers at night so you can wake up beautiful. Apply lotion and tidy up your nails after taking a shower. Always have wavy or straight hair, so if you have naturally wavy hair, you may want to straighten it (and vice versa). Use shampoo and conditioner that makes hair less oily and hydrated, or removes frizz. If you dance or play a sport, pull your hair back into a loose bun or ponytail to look cute and be able to move around. If you do ballet, your teacher will want you in black tights. Those are boring, and colored ones are much better. If you like, you can get (or do your own) a French manicure to look even more glam. Be careful if you want loud colors, because some can look tacky. However, any bright shade, like bright pink, looks cool on your toes.
 Don't wear too much, as you don't want to look like a clown. Wear some eyeliner, mascara, eyeshadow, and lip gloss. If you'd like, you could also put on concealer to hide zits and get magazine-perfect complexion. Magazines such as Seventeen and CosmoGirl have great makeup tips. Wear one necklace daily and a few cute bracelets that match your outfit. Wearing too much of one thing (e.g. 3 necklaces, 8 bracelets) usually looks tacky. Avoid large hoops if your ears are pierced, because they look strange on young girls. Small hoops or bigger Stacey-style hoops are safe.
 Rich girls normally have a hot cell phone such as an Android, Blackberry, or Sidekick, an iPhone 5s and an iPod, too. They also have cool, small digital cameras.

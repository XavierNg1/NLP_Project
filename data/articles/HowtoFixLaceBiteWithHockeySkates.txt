 One foot having the problem may indicate an injury or a differing fit from foot to foot that may be corrected. A refit may be done properly using specialty products and methods that are available and facilitated by carefully re mediating the fit of each shoe at the qualified skate shops.;
, Use this trying-on technique for a few pairs of skates. Try lacing up the boots tightly for the first 3 eyelets, snug but not really tight for the next 3, and as you move to the turn up the ankle lace it up tight to lock in your heel. The idea is to take pressure off the middle area of the foot while locking your heel in position.



If the store who sold you your skates does not have a specialty in skates but also sells tents, pajamas and tires -- chances are the person who sold you your skates didn't know exactly what they were doing. This could result in an improper fit and be the reason your feet hurt. Most hockey shops and dedicated skate shops have a machine that can heat up the skates and make the padding pliable and soft. You then lace the skate up tightly and sit down with the runners (blade) flat on the floor for 15 minutes. You should avoid walking or flexing the boot when you do this process. The boot will mold to your foot shape and retain a memory. This process is called Baking and greatly reduces break in time.

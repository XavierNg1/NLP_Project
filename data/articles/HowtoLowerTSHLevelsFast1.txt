 The fastest way to lower your TSH levels due to hyperthyroidism is to take antithyroid drugs like propylthiouracil and methimazole. These drugs are available by prescription from your doctor. They partially block the production of the thyroid hormone and lower your TSH levels. However, it will take six to twelve weeks for the drugs to take full effect.Your doctor may also recommend antithyroid medications to lower your TSH levels so you can take radioactive iodine to reduce your TSH levels further. You may be given radioactive iodine later and taken off the antithyroid medication.;
, Antithyroid medications can cause serious damage to your liver and lead to a low white blood cell count. If you are allergic to these medications, you may experience symptoms like skin rashes, hives, fever, and joint pain.If you experience any of these symptoms, stop taking the medication and speak to your doctor immediately.
Have your doctor confirm you are not allergic to antithyroid medications before you take them.
 Have regular check ins with your doctor to confirm your TSH levels are going down with the help of the medication. It may take one to two years for your TSH levels to go down completely while on the medication.Your doctor may also suggest that you try other treatments like radioactive iodine or thyroid surgery if your TSH levels do not go down with the medication.
 You may experience remission after taking antithyroid medication for 18 to 24 months in a row. Some people experience remission within six months of taking the medication.Always follow your doctor's instructions on dosage of the antithyroid medication. Do not take more than instructed.

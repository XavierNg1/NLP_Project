 For the purposes of this demonstration article, we have chosen an 8. Use rounded drawing at all times, even with numbers that have straighter edges. Think of ballooning as you move the pencil around corners.
 Keep the outline rounded.
 It is ready now, or you can embellish as explained in the next step.
 Make the bubble numbers more interesting and elaborate by adding different designs to them, such as rainbow shading, spots, lines, small shapes etc.

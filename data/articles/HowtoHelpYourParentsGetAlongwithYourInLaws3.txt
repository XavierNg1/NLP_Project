 Many couples introduce their parents and in-laws to each other after announcing their engagement. If this is the case for you and your partner, find ways to involve both of your families in planning your wedding.


Working towards a common goal will give your parents and in-laws a sense of camaraderie and a chance to get to know each other better., If your parents and your partner’s parents live nearby and enjoy each other’s company, invite them over occasionally for dinner or an activity. Chatting over a meal or playing ping-pong together can foster a sense of family bonding., Your partner knows their family best, and they probably have a good idea of how to handle disagreements with their parents. If you or your family run into conflicts with your in-laws, ask your partner to step in and help you smooth things out.You might say, "Honey, I think your Mom was a bit insensitive about my family's religious views. Would you mind talking to them about that so we can prevent problems in the future?"

, It’s great when parents and in-laws hit it off, but realistically, that’s not always possible. Do your best to ensure your parents get along with your partner’s parents when they get together, but don’t try to force a connection if it doesn’t happen naturally.Also, don't feel like it is a personal failing if your two families don't click. Remember, it is your relationship with your partner that is most important. Letting go of your expectations may help make it easier to accept whatever happens.
If it's clear the two sides detest one another, you might consider only inviting both sides to big events. It might be nice to split holidays or vacations between families to keep down confusion.

 Look for small tomatillos that feel firm and are free from defects.Small tomatillos will be sweeter than larger ones. Generally, a good tomatillo should be smaller than a golf ball.
Also pay attention to the husk surrounding the fruit. It should be light brown and fresh. Avoid tomatillos with shriveled, dried husks.
 When you're ready to use the tomatillos, simply peel the husk away using your fingers.

The husks are inedible, so removal is necessary.
You should leave the actual green skin of the fruit intact.
 Clean each tomatillo under cool running water before roasting it.

Most tomatillos will be slightly sticky before you clean them.
Dry well with clean paper towels when done.

 You want to find a collection of the best subjects to dish all the dirt on-whether they will remain anonymous or not- is your choice. (RE:Warnings);
, Mention the mysterious air about them (for best affect,pick someone who went away for awhile,then returned without a word-like Serena).
 You want to be caught out after Day 1#. Get a tech type in that knows their Dells from their Apple's.It may cost a bit to get started if you want top security. Keep in mind that you can be tracked by email or number- so pick a silent, untraceable number (you can buy disposable,untraceable phones like the TracFone for $60 plus $20 per month to cover the silent number costs!). They may be a small fortune-but if you catch on to something good,it'll be worth it in the end.
, A personalised one! Your number will form letters, so pick a title (gossip girl could be taken, so try a different way of spelling it-or a new name,like 'gossip diva', for a personal touch to your new 2nd life!)

,, Its Upper-EastSide territory here- so quotes from famous poets and people are A-OK- but mention things about your local skate park restoration and how the cat next door is on its last legs- and you've gone from hot new-on-the-market,to yesterdays-news in under 2 days.
 The non-commercial type,though! Mention luxury brands and items-Godiva truffles, Oscar de la Renta gowns, Marc Jacobs shoes and M.A.C lipgloss are all good. Target, Kmart and Super cheap auto references are not cool. Unless your blog is the Lower East Side tell all.
 Gossip Girl packed a punch with titles like 'Roman Holiday','17 Candles','High Society' and 'The Blair Bitch Project' parodying old movies.

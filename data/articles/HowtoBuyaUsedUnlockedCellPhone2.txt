 Used, unlocked cell phones can be purchased from local retail stores or shops that sell refurbished devices.


Find stores in your area by referring to your local phone directory or by performing an Internet search, using keywords such as "used unlocked cell phones" and the name of your local town or city.
Search for cell phones on websites that host local classified ads, such as Craigslist, which will require you to meet up with the seller in person.
 Although the cell phone may not have visible physical damage, the phone may not function properly if it has been exposed to liquid or water.


Remove the battery cover and battery from the cell phone.
Look for a small, white, round dot or square sticker located on the inside of the phone where the battery normally resides. If the sticker is colored red instead of white, this indicates that the phone has been exposed to liquid.
 This will allow you to determine if the cell phone functions properly; especially if the venue or seller will not honor a return, refund, exchange, or provide a warranty.


Power the cell phone on and test all physical parts of the phone; including the flip or slider features, the battery charger, and antennae, if applicable.
Make an outgoing call, send an outgoing text message, test the camera, and the Internet service, if possible. If the seller or a friend is willing to help, have them call you and text you to determine that the incoming services also work.
 You may want to familiarize yourself with return and exchange policies in the event you have any problems with the cell phone after buying it.


If you are buying the phone from a private seller, ask the person why they are selling the phone to clarify any potential malfunctions or problems the phone may have.

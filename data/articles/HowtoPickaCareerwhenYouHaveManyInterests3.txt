 Some jobs may offer less opportunity for advancement than others. Take this into account when investigating careers related to your interests. You may be quite satisfied working the same job for a long period of time, but if that sounds undesirable, you may want to choose a career where you can be promoted into new roles.
 Some jobs might sound fun at your current age, but later in your life these might become difficult for you. For example, football players have a very physically demanding job, and because of this the average age of retirement is 28. Many players find it difficult to support themselves after retiring.Another reason to think long term is to prevent your life decisions from conflicting with your career ones. For example, if you plan on staying home and raising children, jobs requiring long hours, like lawyer, might not work out.
 While volunteering or working as an intern, you'll be able to ask questions about job prospects to people who have experience with hunting for a job.

Many schools set up volunteer or internship programs, especially at the collegiate level. Check with your school's career services center to see if your school offers a suitable program.

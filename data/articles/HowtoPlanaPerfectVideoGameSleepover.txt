 Figure out where it will be and who will be able to come.;
, A sleepover usually turns into an all-nighter! Find out who will bring what. Remember to get food, drinks, and video games!

, If the "sleepover" is in your room, clean your room and set out the sleeping bags and the video game systems. Make sure you stack the video games into a pile so you can see the title of them.
 Make it look like a buffet! Everyone should have a plate and a cup. Basically, it should look like you're having dinner. This way, things are convenient and awesome.
 Bring your friends over and start partying! Just don't wake up your parents. Be sure to have some caffeine! Whether it's soda or coffee, you need to stay awake.

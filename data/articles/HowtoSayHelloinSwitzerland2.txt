 Swiss-German is similar to classic German, but there are many local dialectic twists that will make your greetings easier to understand. All the vowels in these words should be pronounced. If you see ue, üe or ie, for instance, you should pronounce the "u", the "e", and the "i" as distinct syllables. If you are writing, take note that all nouns in German are capitalized., Say "Grüetzi" to one person, or "Gruetzi mittenand" to two or more people. In most German-speaking areas, the word "Grüetzi" is equivalent to the English "Hi." Phonetically, this sounds like "Gryətsi" or "Groo-et-see". You can also try "Guten Tag", in the standard German, which is easier to pronounce and remember. Consider these other informal greetings:


Hoi/Salü/Sali: "Hi", more informal than Grüetzi. "Hoy", "Saloo", "Salee".
Hoi zäme: "Hi" to more than one person. "Hoy zah-may".
Ciao (the same as the Italian "Ciao", pronounced "chow")

, You will want to use more formal phrases when you are greeting business associates and people you do not know well. Most of these greetings relate to the time of day.


"Gueten Morgen!": "Good morning!" Pronounced "Goo-eh-ten more-gen" ("gen" pronounced with a hard "G"). In some areas, German-speakers use "guetä Morgä," with the shortcut "Morgä" or "Morge" (differs from canton to canton).

This is usually used until about noon. In some areas of Germany, it is only said until 10 a.m.


"Guetä Tag!": "Good day!" Pronounced "Goo-eh-ta togg".

This phrase is usually said between the hours of noon and 6 p.m.


"Gueten Abig.": "Good evening." Pronounced "Goo-eh-ten ah-beeg".

This greeting is usually used after 6 p.m.

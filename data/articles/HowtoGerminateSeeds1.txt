You can meet other gardeners, get seeds, and get tips for germinating specific types of seeds in your area.;
, Some seeds need to germinate indoors several weeks before the weather gets warm, while others need only a few days' time. The time you need to start your seeds also differs by growing region. Getting the timing right is important if you want to give your seeds the best chance to grow into strong, healthy plants.


Check the back of the packet your seeds came in for instructions on when they should be started. Seed packets come with a lot of vital information.
You can also look online for more info about when to start your seeds.

Research the needs of the seeds you're growing and get the appropriate growing medium from a nursery or online vendor.


You can buy a soilless growing medium that's premixed, and it works for many types of seeds.It's cheap to make your own growing medium from vermiculite, perlite, and milled sphagnum moss, all available at garden stores. A ration of 1:1:1 is usually effective.

The width of your container depends on how many seeds you're planting; make sure you allow plenty of space for the seeds to germinate.


You can buy a seed pallet or tray, but it's just as easy to make your own out of an old egg carton, newspaper, a wooden box, or other household supplies.
When the seeds germinate and sprout, the seedlings will need to be moved to larger containers or planted in the ground. For this reason the aesthetics of the seed germination containers aren't as important as their utility.

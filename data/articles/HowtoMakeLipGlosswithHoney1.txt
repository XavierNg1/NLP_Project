 Wash them carefully with soap and water, and then sterilize them with rubbing alcohol. Rinse them out once more with water so that you won't be able to taste the alcohol when using your new lip gloss.If you don't have old containers on hand, you can purchase new ones from a beauty supply store, drugstore, or even a dollar store.;
, Microwave for 30 seconds.


Vaseline is the most common and easy-to-find brand of petroleum jelly.Honey is great to use in homemade lip glosses because it's a humectant, meaning it attracts and retains water. It also adds a nice shine and tastes great, too!You can also use a double boiler if you don't have a microwave. A double broiler consists of a bowl placed on top of a pan of simmering water. The bowl does not touch the water, but creates a seal with the bottom pan to trap the steam produced by the simmering water. This prevents the substances being melted from burning.
Another way to melt the ingredients is to put them in a plastic bag and then float the bag in hot water. Do this until the ingredients are melted. Then snip off a small corner of the bag to pour out the melted petroleum jelly and honey., If the ingredients are completely melted you can remove them from the microwave or double broiler. Otherwise, heat them again for another 30 seconds.


Be careful with the melted ingredients. If very hot, they can cause a burn.
 Let the container(s) cool on the counter until firmed up a bit., Store at room temperature and make sure the container does not get overly warm.

Lip gloss should last for up to 6 months.

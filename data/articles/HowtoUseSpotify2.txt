 By going to the search bar in the left side of the screen, you are able to search and select music from nearly any artist. Some musicians, however, do not offer their music via Spotify.
 To do this, you can use the search bar to find different artists and songs and then select the button to the right of each title to open a drop down menu. On this menu, you can create a new playlist to add it to, or you can add it to a previously created playlist. You can also use the playlist tool on the left side bar to make new playlists.
 This is available by selecting the radio button on the left sidebar, and then choosing a genre of music at the bottom of the page. Spotify will then play a “radio station” of songs which you can pause, rewind, or fast-forward through.
 You can share your music with friends via Facebook connected with Spotify. There is also an option to “follow” your favorite bands or artists to listen to music that they are listening to through Spotify.
 When you listen to certain artists or radio stations on Spotify, artists or songs similar to what you listen to most are suggested for you. You can help to make these suggestions more personal by "liking" songs that are played on their radio stations. You can also visit the "discover" button on the left dash to see songs that are selected for you or popular in your area.
 This is found on the left side column, and is where you can download apps that work with spotify to enhance your music experience. Some of these apps help to introduce you to up-and-coming artists, show you popular playlists, and give you music recommendations.
 If you are listening to one song, you can mouse-over another and press play to listen to a brief preview of that song without stopping yours.

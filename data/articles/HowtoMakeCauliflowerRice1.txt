 Look over the top of the cauliflower for any brown or discolored spots. Remove them with a sharp knife., You want to get to the good, white stuff, so remove the leaves and discard them.
 Then, cut the florets off the core until you have a pile of florets and the core.


Discard the core.
Cut the florets into evenly sized pieces. Don’t worry about making the pieces perfect or completely even., You can also use a blender if you don’t have a food processor.


If you have neither of these kitchen tools, you can try to grate up the cauliflower florets with a grater. But be prepared to use your arm muscles!

, Set the food processor on low speed. Don’t overload the bowl of the processor or blender by pouring in all the cauliflower at once.The florets should be evenly chopped, but not pulverized.
They should resemble grains of white rice.
 If you’re processing a lot of cauliflower, store the “rice” in freezer safe sandwich bags. Make sure you remove the excess air in the bags before you seal them.Store the “rice” in the freezer for up to three months.When preparing frozen cauliflower rice, remove the bags from the freezer and leave them on the kitchen counter for a few minutes. This will soften and defrost the rice so it will be ready for cooking.

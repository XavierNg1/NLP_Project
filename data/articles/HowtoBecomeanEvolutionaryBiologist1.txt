 In order to become an evolutionary biologist, you will first need to graduate from high school. As a high school student, you should take as many math and science courses as possible to prepare you for coursework in these subject areas at a university or community college.

Try to take advanced placement courses in science and math, if possible.
If you have the opportunity, try to take science or math courses for college credit as a high school student.;
, If you want to become an evolutionary biologist, you will need to complete a bachelor’s degree in the field. Some schools have degrees in evolutionary biology, while others offer degrees in biology with an emphasis in evolutionary biology., As an undergraduate pursuing a degree in evolutionary biology, you will need to take a wide variety of coursework in math and science. For example, most undergraduate programs in evolutionary biology require students to complete courses in ecology, genetics, calculus, and chemistry.You will also need to take a number of electives that are outside of your major field.
 Most undergraduate degree programs in evolutionary biology require students to complete several lab experiences. While some programs mandate only two lab experience requirements, other programs might require three or four. Completing these requirements is necessary to earn your bachelor’s degree., Most undergraduate programs require students to complete a capstone course in evolutionary biology. This course is usually taken during your senior year, and often includes research and career development., To be a successful evolutionary biologist, you should consider pursuing a master’s and/or Ph.D. in the field. To apply for these programs, you will need to pass the Graduate Record Exam and submit an application that includes your undergraduate transcripts and letters of recommendation from your former professors or lab supervisors.

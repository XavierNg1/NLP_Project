 While some salons might claim that a bikini wax is painless, you should not take such claims at face value. You will experience pain during your wax, especially if it is your first time. The pain, however, should only last for the duration of your wax., Some people recommend taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, like ibuprofen, before you get a bikini wax. This can help mediate some of the pain you might experience when you get a bikini wax. Ask your doctor if taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug is a good choice for you., Hair follicles are connected to blood vessels, which means there might be a little blood when the hair is pulled out. You are more likely to bleed a little if itâ€™s your first bikini wax., It is normal to have a little bit of redness after a bikini wax. This will usually last no more than a few hours after the procedure. If you still have redness and inflammation in the days after the wax, call your practitioner.

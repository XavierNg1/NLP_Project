 Every outlet box in your home will usually have at least 3 wires in it: A hot, a neutral and a ground. In the case of a switch that controls a ceiling fan or overhead light, for instance, will have a feed (3 wires) and an out (3 more wires going to the fan). The 2 neutrals (white in the US, generally blue elsewhere) will be wire-nutted together, and the 2 grounds (bare or green, sometimes stripped with yellow) will be wire-nutted together. The two remaining hots will attach to the switch itself (the feed hot on the bottom, and the out hot on the top).;
, A regular two socket outlet will have 5 screws behind it. Two will be for the neutral (white), two will be for the hots (black) and one for the ground (green).
 The hots will attach to the remaining two screws.
 Simply follow the same rules described above for attaching the wires.

 Shooting stars are not, in fact, stars at all. They are meteors, which are made up of pieces of interplanetary rocks or debris. When they break into earth’s surface, they light up the night sky. Find a calendar of the next meteor shower and drive out to a dark, secluded place.Though it’s possible to see a shooting star on any given night, you’re likely to see more during a meteor shower. Check out http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/earthskys-meteor-shower-guide for listings of this year’s meteor showers.;
, In order to wish on a star, you have to be able to see the stars. Because of light pollution, it’s nearly impossible to see stars in cities or even large towns or suburbs at night.Take a ride out to one of your favorite scenic spots, such as a mountain, field, or lake outside of the city. It’ll be easier to see the stars out in nature.
 Once you’ve gotten out into nature, choose an area that seems dark and comfortable and set up camp. Lie on your back or sit so that the stars and night sky are filling your field of vision.Pack as if you’re going on a picnic. Bring a camping chair, layers of clothes, water, and plenty of snacks.

 First, your hat will need to be black or brown. You can use black or brown paper from the start, or you can color in the paper after the fact. Add a "skull and crossbones" to the smooth front of the hat to show your friends that you're a scurvy sea dog. Consider ripping chunks out of the hat so that it looks worn and weather-beaten – a few tasteful burn marks would not be out of place here, either. Yarrr!


If you're feeling fancy, try sticking a feather into the hat. Poke the sharp tip of the feather through the paper just above the flaps, and make sure that it sticks there. The more colorful and tropical-looking the feather, the better!

, A naval captain needs a crisp, clean white hat. Avoid lined or colored paper. Don't decorate with anything – except for, perhaps, a thin golden lining, or an ornate-looking naval insignia. If you'd like to be more direct, simply write "U.S. Navy" or "Naval Officer".
 Get creative! Invent a country and proudly fly its flag. Draw your own insignia on the front of the hat. Decorate with crazy colors, sparkles, beads, feathers – anything that feels right!

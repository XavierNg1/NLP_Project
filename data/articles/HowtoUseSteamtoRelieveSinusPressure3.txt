 To help improve the health of your sinuses, place a humidifier in your bedroom while you sleep. A humidifier produces steam and moist air, which will help clear out the nasal passages.When your nasal passages are blocked, you need to focus on keeping your nasal passages and sinuses moist. Although many people think that if you have have a runny nose, that dry air is the trick, dry air only further irritates the membranes in your nasal passage.
Humidifiers are especially good during the wintertime because the air in most homes is very dry due to central heating.Even placing a hot water bottle near the ear may have a similar effect and help to draw out ear fluid.
 Taking a long, hot shower works very similarly to the steam treatments described above. The hot water from the shower creates warm, moist air that is useful in clearing out blocked nasal passages and relieving sinus pressure.You also achieve a similar beneficial effect by placing a warm compress on your face to help open up your nasal passages and relieve any pressure you might be feeling in your sinuses., Make sure that you drink lots of water (at least 8 full glasses a day) because this will thin out your mucus and can help prevent sinuses blockages, and thereby ease pressure.Thinned out mucus is much more likely to drain. Whenever you feel the beginnings of sinus pressure, make a concerted effort to stay hydrated., When you go to sleep at night, place a couple of pillows beneath your head so that it is elevated. This will make breathing easier and keep the sinus pressure from building up.

 When the lights are low, it's easier to believe that a monster with a chainsaw could come up from behind and surprise you. With the lights on, you can take a break from looking at the screen and look at the lint on the carpet or watch your cat scratching his post. Tell your friends you'd like to watch the movie with a few lights turned on.
 This little trick can be done in a theater or at home, and it instantly takes away the movie's power. So, you're watching a disgustingly creepy scene where a clown monster chases a little girl up some stairs? Picture a group of people with cameras capturing it all on film. It's not so scary when you realize that behind every single scene is an entire crew of people: camera operators, lighting operators, other actors, and so on. Picture the director telling the actors what to do. "Run up two stairs, look behind you, scream, then keep running. More feeling this time." It'll help the scenes lose their potency.
 Yell at the screen when things get too scary. If you've ever watched a horror movie in a theater, you've probably noticed people doing this. "She's opening the door. She's going in! No, don't go in there!" There seems to be a universal agreement that it's OK to talk during horror movies. If you're in a home setting with some die-hard fans, you may annoy them, but that's the price they should have to pay for making you watch a horror movie.
 Horror movies are often pretty hilarious. Aliens pop out of people's stomachs, hideous trolls end up fighting each other instead of killing their prey, and so on. Spot the comedic moments, which are sometimes the scariest, and laugh out loud. After all, the point of watching a movie is to be entertained.

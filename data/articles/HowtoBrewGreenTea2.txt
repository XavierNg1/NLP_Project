 A tea ball can also be dropped into a teapot for one or two if easier. Just be sure that the tea ball has the capacity for the amount of cups you're planning on brewing.
 The boiled water should be "first boil" (see the boiling instructions under "Brewing loose green tea in a teapot" for more details). The water should be allowed to sit for a moment as the ideal temperature for water for green tea is 180 °F (82 °C), 80C.
 Leave the tea to steep for a few minutes (3 to 5 minutes is usually enough, unless the tea instructions advise otherwise).
, Enjoy it with some matcha and chocolate swirl cake.

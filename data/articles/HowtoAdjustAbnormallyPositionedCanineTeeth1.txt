 The canine teeth (long, curved teeth by the incisors) are commonly misaligned in dogs. If your dog's teeth are only mildly misaligned, a hard rubber ball or rubber chew toy (Kong toy) may be all that’s needed to correct the misalignment.Kong toys and balls are available at most pet shops and online. However, since there are so many options, talk to your vet about which option would be best for your dog.


Choose a toy size that is appropriate for your dog’s size.;
, The rubber ball or toy will be most effective when your dog plays with it for at least 15 minutes, three times a day.To encourage your dog to play with the ball or toy, give it to your dog as a special treat for good behavior. You could also put some tasty treats in the Kong toy and use it as a food puzzle.


It’s perfectly fine for your dog to play with the toy for more than 45 minutes a day. The longer your dog plays with the toy, the more likely the toy will correct the teeth alignment issues.
 After your dog has had a week or two of playing with the ball or toy, look at your dog’s teeth. If you do not notice any improvements in the teeth alignment, you may need to consider other treatment options. Contact your vet to discuss these options.


Consider taking a picture of your dog’s teeth before your dog starts playing with the hard rubber toy. Then, take another picture a week or two later. Compare the two pictures to determine if there’s been any improvement in teeth alignment.

, The best type of bread to use for this is something that is slightly stale with a thick crust, such as: boule, ciabatta, and sourdough.Try to make your pieces about ¾-inch (1.91-centimeter) wide.You can remove the crust if you want to, but many people choose to leave it on for texture and variation. Here are some ways you can cut your croutons:If you want standard croutons, cut the bread into slices first, then into cubes.
If you want something rustic, simply tear your bread into small chunks.
If you want French croutons, cut a baguette into ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) thick slices.
 If you want something simple, a teaspoon or two of salt will do. If you want something more flavorful, try adding some fresh or dried herbs.


If you wish to make Parmesan cheese or fresh herb croutons, hold off on the cheese/herbs for right now; you will add them later., Keep tossing until the bread pieces are evenly coated.If you are making French croutons, use a pastry brush to lightly coat each side with the oil mixture instead., Make sure that the croutons are not touching, or they may end up soggy. If you can't fit all of the croutons onto one baking sheet, divide them between two baking sheets. If you have a small oven, you will need to bake the croutons on different levels, then rotate the baking sheets after 5 minutes so that they bake evenly.
 Depending on how stale the bread was and the size you made the pieces, your croutons may be done after 10 minutes.If they aren't, toss them again, and bake them for another 5 minutes or so. Some croutons may take up to 20 minutes, especially if you like them extra-crunchy.If you are making French croutons, use a spatula or a pair of tongs to flip the croutons over.
If you want to make Parmesan cheese/fresh herb croutons, add the cheese/herbs after the first 5 minutes of baking, just after you toss the croutons., If you have any leftover croutons, store them in an airtight container.

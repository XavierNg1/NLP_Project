 This is essential step one, as it prevents someone from taking complete control of your body. If someone has a big handful of your hair you pretty much have to go where they pull you, as they have a lot of leverage.









You want to allow them to move your head, slightly, but not your hair.;
, Both hands should grab either side of their wrist with the thumbs below the and fingers meeting, but not interlocked, above. Take some of the advantages away by gripping their wrists and holding it close to your head, limiting their control of you.









Step forward, towards the pull, to use the attacker's energy against them.
 This is the weakest finger and the easiest way to get in and pry the grip off. Luckily, you don't even have to be that strong, as a broken little finger will more than likely cause them to let go.









Do not try to peel all of their fingers off at once. The pinky is small and weak -- no match for the strength of your whole arm.
 Use your body weight and other hand to help to get more strength. You want to push their wrist away with the one hand, peel back the pinkie with the other, and simultaneously step away to remove their hand from your hair.

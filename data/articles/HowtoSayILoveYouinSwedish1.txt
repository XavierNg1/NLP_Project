 This word is the subject form of the first-person pronoun (or, in English, "I"). Swedish grammar isn't exactly the same as in English, but for this phrase, the words are in the same order as in "I love you," so "I" goes at the beginning."Jag" is pronounced roughly like "Jah."Note that the g is silent — the word isn't pronounced "jog."
Some Swedish speakers pronounce this word with a Y sound ("Yah") because of their regional accent. Whether you use a J or a Y sound is a matter of personal preference.;
, In Swedish, this is the present-tense verb form of "love". It is made by adding an r to the end of "älska" ("to love").


This word can be tricky for non-Swedes to manage. Roughly, it is pronounced "elskuh." The letter ä sounds like the 'e' in "fell" (though, in some dialects, it sounds more like the 'a' in "hang").The r at the end is more or less silent — if you pronounce it, it should be very light and delicate., This word is the object form of "you".


Don't be fooled by the way this word is spelled. "Dig" is pronounced almost exactly like the English word "day." It shouldn't sound like the English verb "dig" at all., Practice saying each word individually until you're confident with all three. When you're ready, put them together. Saying these words in order will give you the Swedish phrase for "I love you."


The entire phrase is pronounced as roughly "Jah elskuh day." Don't forget that you can also use a Y sound for the first word, giving you "Yah elskuh day."

 Getting rental coverage through your travel insurer can be a great option between getting insurance through your rental company and getting insurance through your card. But the rental insurance is an add on, so you’ll need to purchase it along with a travel insurance plan.There could be several reasons for not wanting to use your card company. Maybe your credit limit isn’t high enough, you don’t have another credit card, or you simply don’t want to deal with the hassle of getting reimbursed. Purchasing rental insurance through your travel insurer can be cheaper than going with the rental company, and easier than using a card company.
Just remember to bring along a copy of your policy to the car rental agency.
 As you might expect, you’ll need to gather information about your trip, your companions, and your rental car. You will need:The dates of travel (including travel while abroad). So if you travel to Europe and tour several countries, the insurer would need to know when you would be moving between each country.
The destinations, including additional destinations while abroad. For example, if you were going on a road trip through Central America, which countries you planned on visiting.
All of the names and dates of birth for anyone in your travel group.
The total trip cost.
The type of car you’ll be driving, how long you’ll be driving it, who will be driving it, and license information for all drivers.
 Most travel insurance plans will offer coverage to reimburse for a cancelled or interrupted trip, return airfare, medical expenses, and lost baggage. The coverage limits will vary according to the insurer and what you’re willing to pay for.There are a number of good travel insurers, including Travel Guard, Allianz Global Assistance, and Travelex. Many are affiliated with large general insurance companies. Make sure that you compare several brands.

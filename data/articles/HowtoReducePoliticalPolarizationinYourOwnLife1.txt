 However, when you’re trying to remove political polarization from your life, it’s important to remember that the other side has merits as well.


You likely have a loved one who belongs to the other party, and if you respect that person, you should know they have a reason for choosing the side they are on.;
, Just as you have reasons for why you belong to the political party you do, so do other people. Consider people’s backgrounds, religious beliefs, and cultures when attempting to see why they belong to the party they do. Removing polarization from your life is all about accepting other people and their beliefs.


If you know someone who has different political views, respectfully ask why they believe what they do. You could say, “I respect you and your beliefs and am curious why you have the political beliefs that you do. I want to learn about the other side of the political party.” This isn’t the time to argue or confront them on their views. Simply sit back and listen., You’ll need to decide what is more important to you when you have people in your life who don’t hold your political beliefs: changing their minds or keeping the relationship. If you want to maintain the connection you have, you may just need to agree to disagree on the subject. This could mean avoiding talking about politics at all.


If your loved one attempts to engage you in a political conversation in which you know conflict could occur, you could say, “Out of respect to you and our relationship, I don’t think we should talk about politics. We have different beliefs and points of view and it seems that we argue when we discuss them. I want to continue having a good relationship with you and I think talking about politics threatens that.” They may be upset at first, but they will likely understand over time.

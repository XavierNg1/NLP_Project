 A minor punishment, like a swear jar, can help curb your friendâ€™s cursing. When engaging in minor punishments, like a swear jar, both you and your friend should participate. By participating, you are showing your support.With your friend, make a pact that you will both carry around a small jar or pot. Every time you use a curse word, donate a penny or a nickel to the jar. At the end of the day, you can compare who has more money in the jar.
 People use profanity for a variety of reasons. Some common reasons are that they think swearing makes them look more mature, impressive, or respected in front of their peers. Explain to your friend that using profanity can actually have the opposite effect. It can turn people off, as well as give an impression of immaturity.You can tell your friend, "I know you like to curse a lot, but I think it is having the opposite effect of what you intended. When you use curse words instead of other, more descriptive words, it comes off as immature and excessive. I know I curse sometimes, too. But we can work on this together."

, If you notice your friend making progress, then recognize their effort. Offer to take them out to coffee, ice cream, or the movies. This will encourage your friend to keep improving. It will also show your friend that you support them and want the best for them.You can say, "I noticed that you stopped cursing so much. I am really impressed. It takes a lot of effort to change bad habits, especially cursing. Let me take you out to coffee."

 When people lie, they are likely to use short responses to questions and elaborate less about their story. They might also pause and take longer to respond. When they do respond to statements and questions from others, people will give fewer rich details.


Try prompting the other person to tell a story that should be long. For example, ask what that person’s plans are for the holidays. Avoid asking questions whose answers could be “yes” or “no.”

, If you listen carefully to the way the person tells his or her story, you can sometimes tell if it’s a lie. Liars use more sense-based words, like “I saw,” “it smelled like,” or “I heard.” They also will probably use other-oriented pronouns and phrases, like “she forgot this” or “something happened to the car” instead of “I forgot this.”


Liars are less likely than truth-tellers to correct themselves while telling a story.
Look out for more far-fetched stories, that seem outside of the realm of possibility.
People who are lying generally use fewer gestures.
 Is the person speaking in a higher tone than normal? Is the person speaking faster than normal? Quieter or louder? The discomfort of lying usually makes people’s voices sound higher, but some individuals may compensate or go another route. If your significant other is speaking in unusual tones, it might be a sign.

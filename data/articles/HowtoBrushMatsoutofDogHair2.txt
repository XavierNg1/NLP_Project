 If the mat won't break apart or loosen with your fingers, the rake, or comb, try a mat splitter. Keep holding the mat at the base. Use the mat splitter to cut the mat into smaller strips. After you cut it into smaller sections, try to work through it with your fingers or a comb.Use a sawing motion when you cut the hair.Be careful using a mat splitter. It has a razor sharp edge and can seriously injure your dog. Always watch out for the ears, folds of skin, loose skin, and the tip of the tail., When everything else fails, try clippers. Use the clippers to slowly shave away the mat. This may leave a bare patch where you have shaved the coat.Make sure to watch carefully as you trim away the mat. Do not cut too close to your dog's skin., If the mats are too difficult to remove, or your dog is not cooperating, take your dog to the groomers. They can shave the dog or use their knowledge, experience, and tools to remove the mats easier than you can., Though some people suggest using scissors, you should refrain from using them on your pet. You can seriously injure your dog, especially around the sensitive areas like the ears.Scissors can cut the skin or pull and strain it. Even dematting tools can be dangerous due to their razor-sharp blades.If you are uncomfortable using these sharp objects on your dog, then take him to a professional.

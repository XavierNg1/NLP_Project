 When the battle starts, run towards the other side of the room and take out your shotgun. Their attacks do medium to high damage; keeping your distance is advisable.;
, You will get 1-2 shots at best; don't be too greedy or they might get close enough to attack you.


Getting attacked while shooting at medium range is worse than getting attacked at close range, as their medium range attack deals more damage than the close one.
 Once they get near you, run towards the opposite end of the room; this way they'll never be able to catch you, but be careful when running to the opposite side. Make sure you don't walk directly underneath them or you might get caught by their feet.
 Do this until one of them dies. It takes around 8 shots of the Shotgun and 24 shots of the Pistol to kill one of them.


Shotgun is advised when you're up against two of them as the shots will cause damage to both of them.
 Once you've killed one of the Flesh lips, start using your pistol to shoot the second one until it dies.


Using the pistol will immobilize the Flesh Lip and halt its advances towards you. However, this will not work when there's still two of them because the pistol can only target one enemy at a time, leaving you vulnerable to attacks from multiple enemies.
 After the second Flesh Lip dies, another one will fall down from the roof, get away from it and start shooting it with your pistol to immobilize it.
 Since the last Flesh Lip will be alone, you should have no problem killing it. Once it is dead, you'll be treated to a cut scene.

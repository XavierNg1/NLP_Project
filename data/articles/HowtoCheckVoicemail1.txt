 On an iOS phone, tap on the Phone application and then look for a square in the bottom right hand corner of the screen that reads Voicemail. Tap this button and your voice messages will appear on the screen. Click on any of the messages and press Play to hear the message. On an Android phone, a voicemail icon will appear at the top left of your screen in the Status area if you have an unread voicemail. Swipe your finger down from the top of the screen to view your notifications and then press New Voicemail. Your phone will dial the voice mailbox.;
, If you don't have it memorized, you may have to look it up. Many phones have your cell phone number saved in the contacts automatically as 'Me'. On an iOS smartphone you can look up your phone number by going to the Settings app and then clicking Phone. For Android, press Settings, About Phone, and then Status. Your phone number will be listed here. Voicemail can sometimes be locked for privacy reasons but the code should be something that you created. Once you have verified your identity, you should be allowed to access to your voicemail.
Contact your specific cell phone provider if you are unable to remember your code. They might be able to reset it for your over the phone and help you with any other problems. Conducting an internet search for your particular provider should bring up a customer service number to call.
 In some cases, you might not need to press the call button but you usually will have to listen to an automated greeting before you can hear your voicemail.


Check to make sure that the asterisk or the pound keys are the correct buttons to press. Which key to press and when to push can depend on your cell phone provider. For most cell phone companies, it's often one of these buttons. Try both, and if neither of them work than visit the website of your phone company or call customer service.

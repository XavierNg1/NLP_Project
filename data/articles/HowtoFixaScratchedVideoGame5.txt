 Try this method only after other methods have failed.
 Again, do not rub in circles.


Follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning. Some waxes or jellies need to dry a bit before they are removed with a paper towel or cloth.
Make sure you get off any and all wax/jelly before you place the CD back in your console. You don't want the inside of your console to be all sticky.
 Repeat if necessary.

Edit Go To cell range A2:A361 and with A2 the active cell enter w/o quotes the formula "=SIN((ROW()-2)*PI()/180)" and Edit Fill Down.
Edit Go To cell range B2:B361 and with B2 the active cell enter w/o quotes the formula "=(C2*A2)+D2" and Edit Fill Down.
Select cell C2 and enter 1. Edit Go To cell range C3:C181 and with C3 the active cell enter w/o quotes the formula "=1+C2" and Edit Fill Down. Edit Go To cell range C182:C361 and with C182 the active cell enter w/o quotes the formula "=C181-1" and Edit Fill Down and Format Cells Font Color Red.
Select cell D2 and enter 25, or another y-intercept of arbitrary choice. Format Cells Fill Yellow. Edit Go To cell range D3:D361 and with D3 the active cell enter the formula w/o quotes, "=D2" and Edit Fill Down.
Edit Go To cell range A2:B361 and choose Charts from the Ribbon or use Chart Wizard and choose All/Other and scroll down and select Scatter Smoothed Line Scatter. A 45 degree or so slanted propeller blade lemniscate small chart should appear. Move it atop the data in columns A:E.
Select cell E2 and enter the formula "=1/8" and Format Cells Number Number Custom "Adj "0.0000 with quotes, then Insert Name Define name Adj for cell $E$2 and Format Cells Fill Sky Blue and Border Black Bold Outline. (It belongs to the data at right or with both sets of data.)

It is left up to the reader whether or not to Insert New Comment of the formulas just input. It is a good practice to do so.

Edit Go To cell range G2:G2882 and with G2 active, input w/o quotes the formula, "=(H2^2*Adj)*J2" and Edit Fill Down and Insert New Comment "Original formula =(H2^2*Adj)*J2"
Select cell H2 and input w/o quotes the formula, "=Unadjusted_Radius" and Insert New Comment "Original formula =Unadjusted_Radius"; Activate the Chart worksheet and select cell J63 and enter Unadjusted Radius. Select cell J64 and enter "=VLOOKUP(Spheroids,LemniscateLooker,4)" and Format Cells Font Red Fill Sky Blue Border Black Bold Outline and Insert Name Define name Unadjusted_Radius for cell $J$64. Return to the Lemniscate worksheet and Edit Go To cell range H3:H2882 and with cell H3 active enter the formula w/o quotes "=H2" and Edit Fill Down.

SPECIAL NOTE: The Unadjusted Radius needs to be adjusted depending upon how many spheroids are entered on the DATA worksheet. Overnight, a Lookup Table was constructed and developed into the formulation, i.e in the first column is the number of Spheroids, and in the fourth column are the values found to provide the roundest spheres for that number of spheroids. Then the variable Unadjusted_Radius is set to "=VLOOKUP(Spheroids,LemniscateLooker,4)" and the Lookup Table has the Defined Name LemniscateLooker. It was a project because there are a minimum number of spheroids really necessary to make up the curve at all. One should feel free to make adjustments to the table at their own discretion. Find it via Edit Go To LemniscateLooker.


Edit Go To cell range I2:I2882 and enter 1 and Edit Fill Series Columns Linear Step Value 1, OK.
Edit Go To cell range J2:J2882 and with J2 active, input w/o quotes the formula, "=SIN(2*I2*PI()/180*Adj)" and Edit Fill Down and Insert New Comment "Original formula =SIN(2*I2*PI()/180*Adj)". This will later be modified for Height.
Select all input columns A:J and do Format Columns Autofit Selection.
Edit Go To cell range F2:G2882 and choose Charts from the Ribbon (or use Chart Wizard) and choose All/Other and scroll down and select Scatter Smoothed Line Scatter. Bernoulli's Lemniscate should appear which should be moved atop the data but not the first few rows. Select cells F1:J2882 and Format Cells Fill Sky Blue, Border Black bold Outline. Format Cell H2 Fill Orange, Font White, Border Black bold Outline.
 I suggest reading through this first and comparing it to one of my other articles you've completed to see if you can copy that sheet, as would be much quicker (see related wikiHows below). In that case, insert 5 columns at column I and move the Looker Table to the right please. Copy and Paste the Lemniscate data from Step 5 F1:J2882 then into the newly inserted columns.

A1: AjRows
B1: GM (for Golden Mean)
C1: Factor1
D1: KEY
E1: Number (there were some notes following this in the previous sheet but we don't need to repeat those).
 I realize that error values will result until all the LOOKUP Tables have been input.

A2: 2880
B2: "=-(1-SQRT(5))/2" Enter formulas w/o quotes please.
C2: "=VLOOKUP(ABS(Spheroids),Looker,2)"
D2: "=IF(Spheroids<=64,Spheroids*VLOOKUP(Spheroids,LOOKER2,5) *PI(),Spheroids*PI())"
Select cell range A2:D2 and Format Sky Blue, Border Black bold Outline.
E2: 1 (this is used as a warper). Format Cells Fill Yellow and Border Black bold Outline.

Edit Go To cell range A3:H4 and Insert Name Create Top Row. OK There may have been some NewDates variables -- they won't be used and have been deleted. Format Cells Fill Sky Blue and Border Black bold Outline. Select jointly with the Command key cells B4, D4 and E4 and Format Cells Fill Font Yellow. It would be a good idea to Insert New Comment and edit in the original values and formulas for all these cells, especially the yellow Input ones -- it's far easier than coming back here to research their original values.

 Work was done to get an overall pleasing effect, not to be consistent. A series approach probably will not work as well as IF Statement bracketing but it may certainly be tried. The formula for a series approach for the increment hasn't occurred yet to the author. It may lie in a TREND Series perhaps which gets smaller and then is resorted to become larger and is pasted in. Needless to say practically, very small quantities of Spheres (x<6) present a particular dilemma in attempting to form a lemniscate with so few. The character limit for an IF Statement is 256 if memory serves, including spaces, if any. Please see the PercentRing solution below.
Fractional quantities of spheres may be entered, with various results, as seen on the far right of the chart and the example of 2pi below in Tips.
 Select cell F64:F65 and enter -.25 IN F64 and Format Cells Number Number Percentage Decimal Places 2 and Font Size 14 (if 9 or 10 is standard). Format cell F64 Fill Yellow Font Color Red. Insert Name Define name PercentRing for cell $F$64. Insert Name Define name Interpretation for cell $F$65 and Format Cells Font Fill Sky Blue. Select cells E64:E65 and Align Right and enter Entry in E64 and select cell E65 and enter =IF(Interpretation<1,"Shrinkage Interpretation",IF(Interpretation>1,"Expansion Interpretation","No Change")). Select cell F65 and enter the formula w/o quotes "=1+PercentRing". It's set up to take values between 100% AND -500%, depending on the Spheroids count, else the axes must be adjusted for logarithmic values (perhaps). So, there will be a facility for Shrinking (or Expanding) the background ring of spheres right on the Charts worksheet. Activate the DATA worksheet and select cell H3 and enter THE DIVISOR and align center and select cell H4 and enter the formula w/o quotes "=1.5*(1-PercentRing)" This may seem backwards but it isn't because it's a divisor, rather than a factor. In subtracting -.25, we add it to 1 and get 125%, which increases 1.5, and so increases the divisor and makes the resulting chart smaller, being more divided. Format Cells Fill Sky Blue.

If a zero is entered in the Chart worksheet PercentRing cell, the result will be 100.00% below and so "No Change".
Thus, to produce a graph that looks like the graph at the top of this article, enter 25 Spheres and -.25 Entry for PercentRing, (approximately). The graph will have changed in total size but will have improved in sphere roundness a good deal.


Edit Go To cell range E6:F2886 and either with the Chart Wizard or with the Ribbon make a new chart by selecting Charts on the Ribbon, All/Other, scroll down to Scattered Smoothed Line Scattered and a small chart should appear next to the LOOKER Table. The spheroids may look somewhat flat. There's a fix for that.
Copy the small chart to the Chart worksheet and pull open the chart at the lower right hand corner when the cursor changes to a double-headed arrow upon hovering or clicking there, and expand it so that it reaches just beyond column L and down to row 62.
Then activate the Data worksheet and Edit Go To cell range G6:H2886 and copy it. Activate the Chart worksheet, click inside the chart and do Command+v Paste. It may very well appear wrong as the series =SERIES(,Data!$E$6:$E$2886,Data!$H$6:$H$2886,2) instead of as the correct series =SERIES(,Data!$G$6:$G$2886, Data!$H$6:$H$2886,2), so ShrinkExpand2 didn't work right, but it is the version in the picture at the top of this article. What you do is double-click on the ring of spheres and make them 75% transparent purple, which one is free to make 100% transparent if so desired, line weight 1. The lemniscate is also line weight 1 in the article chart. The latter version was corrects to the correct series and the PercentRing adjustment fixes the problem with ShrinkExpand2.

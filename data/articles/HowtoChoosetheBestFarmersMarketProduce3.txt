 For cantaloupe and honeydew, sniff the stem end for a light, sweet aroma. In terms of color, cantaloupe should have a golden color and honeydew should be light yellow. For watermelons, look for a yellow spot for ripeness.The yellow spots on watermelons indicate that they were resting on the ground before they were picked.
 For raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, and strawberries, the bottom of the container should not be stained or moist with berry juice. Also inspect the berries for any fuzzy mold. Instead, look for berries that are plump and full.For strawberries, select the ones that are entirely red all the way to the top, i.e., the cap.
 Do this for nectarines and apricots as well, unless you are planning to eat them that day. This way, you can enjoy perfectly ripe peaches throughout the week.For example, pick peaches that are slightly firm, moderately firm, and very firm to hard.
 Because tomatoes continue to ripen after they have been picked, do not be afraid to buy tomatoes that are slightly green near the top. In general, however, look for tomatoes that have a vibrant, red color. They should also be firm to the touch.Try to avoid tomatoes that have bruising and soft spots. This is an indication that they are too ripe.

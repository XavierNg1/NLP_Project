 This option is at the bottom of the context menu that appears and will take you to the “Personalization” menu. Some sample images will be displayed under the “Choose your picture” header.


For simplified, on-the-fly wallpaper changes, simply right-click a photo on your computer and select “Set as desktop background” from the context menu. This lacks some of the customization options of the Personalization menu.
 You will be prompted to browse the folder on your computer to select an image file.
 The photo will be set as your wallpaper and appear in the “Choose your picture” image list.
 This option is useful for images that are smaller or larger than your desktop resolution.


”Fill” will adjust the image so that there is no blank space around the image.
”Fit” will adjust the image so that no part of it is cropped out.
”Tile” will fill all space with repeated copies of the image. This option is best for smaller images.
”Center” will use the exact size of the image.
 Once this option is selected you can add pictures to the slideshow by clicking “Browse” and set a rotation interval from the “Change picture every” dropdown.
 This finalizes your decision once you have settled on a wallpaper choice and optional settings. The settings are auto-saved as you select them.

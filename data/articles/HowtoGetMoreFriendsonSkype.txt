 Other modes of communication besides Skype include texting, Email,Face Time, calling ,and even writing a letter. Maybe you'll like that better than Skype.;
, If you tried other modes of communication and still like Skype better, find people you know that do use Skype.
 People you know may not use Skype, but maybe they'll like it if you show them how. Ask them if they like it and if they say yes, ask them if they want to be your contact. Only if they say they like Skype. Don't force them to do it if they don't want to.
 If they have an account,search them! Go to contacts and press the search sign. Type their Skype name or phone number. When you see them press it and Skype will give that person a contact request from you! Mission accomplished.
 If they're new to Skype, help them make an account. First download the Skype app from the app store with them on their device. Once you open it, it will say sign in and create an account. Press create an account. First make name. Use their real name or have them come up with a fake on like gymnastics4life. Or whatever they want. Next create a Skype name. Whatever you want too. Next is the password. Whatever you want that is 6-20 characters. Repeat password. Just type in the password again. They do this because they want to make sure you remember your password. After that is Email. Type their Email address in. Lastly, type in their phone number. Press done and then follow step 4.

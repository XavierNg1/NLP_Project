 Load an image that you would like to warp.;
, Click the layer that you want to warp in the Layers panel.


If the layer is locked, as it usually is on JPG and PNG images, click the Lock icon to unlock it. Alternatively, drag the layer onto the New Layer icon to create a duplicate, editable layer. The Warp tool does not work on the background.
 At this point, you can use one of the selection tools (such as the Lasso Tool or the Rectangular Marquee Tool in the Toolbox) to select the area you want to warp. Use these exactly as you normally would to select the portion of the layer you want.


To keep your work more manageable, consider making a new layer from your selection (Ctrl+J).

Note: If you select nothing, everything in the layer warps by default.
 This should put a grid-like mesh over the layer or selection.


At this point, you can start warping the image. Click here or scroll down to the section below to learn how to warp.
 At the right end of the options toolbar, you should see a button that looks like a curved grid over a curved arrow. Press this button to switch between the free transform and warp modes.


With the Transform tool active, you can also just right click on the selection and select "Warp" to get the same effect.

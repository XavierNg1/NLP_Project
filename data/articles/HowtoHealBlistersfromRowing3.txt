 Whether your blister has torn open or you lanced and drained it, it's important to keep the area as clean as possible. You should wash the area once each day, and any additional times as needed if the area is exposed to dirt or bacteria. This is particularly important if you continue to row, as river and lake water is full of bacteria that could easily cause an infection.


Use soap and water. Do not use alcohol, peroxide, iodine, or any other wound cleanser, as these will irritate the skin and prolong the healing process.Follow the same guidelines for washing your blister wound as you would for washing your hands.
 If the flap of skin covering the deflated blister gets very dirty or if there is still pus remaining under it, you may need to remove the skin flap. It's best to let a doctor do this, as she will be able to ensure your injury does not get infected. Otherwise, leave the skin flap in place so it will help protect the open sore underneath.If the skin gets bent out of place, gently smooth it back into position over the open sore.
Do not attempt to cut or pull away the skin at home, as this will drastically increase the risk of infection and prolong the healing process.
 Once you've washed the blister wound and smoothed the skin back in place, you'll need to protect the wound. Apply enough antibiotic ointment to sufficiently cover the blister, then cover it with a clean bandage.If your blister grows itchy or develops a rash, stop using the ointment and see your doctor as soon as possible.
Change the bandage every day, and any time it gets dirty or wet. Keep the area clean.
Remove the bandage at night to allow the wound to breathe.
 You can take acetaminophen or ibuprofen to relieve some of the pain caused by the blister. Read the manufacturerâ€™s instructions to find the proper dosage, or talk to your pharmacist or doctor if you are not sure how much to take.

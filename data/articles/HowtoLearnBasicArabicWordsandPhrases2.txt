 Egypt is a major hub for Arabic speakers, but it does have its own unique dialect. As a result some words in Egyptian Arabic are different from those spoken in Modern or Classical Arabic. In order to be understood by someone in Egypt or a nearby country (such as Sudan), you should learn a few basic terms in Egyptian Arabic.
 Just like in English, there are many ways to say hello or to greet someone. Even if you don't end up speaking all of these, learning them will be helpful when you hear them spoken to you. Here are a few basic greetings in Egyptian Arabic:


Assalaam aleykoom Or Salamo Aleko(peace be with you, used for starting a conversation)
Salaam (peace, used for ending a conversation)
Ezayek(female) Or Ezayak(male) (how are you?)
Ahlan wa sahlan (welcome)
Amla/amel eh (how are you?)

, There are several words and phrases that are used regularly in conversation, but may not be useful for forming a conversation or sentence. Here are some popular words and phrases you are likely to hear and use on a regular basis:


Aywa (yes)
La'a (no)
Shokran (thank you)
Affwan (you're welcome)
Law Samaht (please)
Kwayes (good)
Aasif (sorry)
Kol haga (everything)
Feen (where)
Leeh (why)

, You'll need to learn a few basic sentences that are either responses to questions (such as 'I am good') or that are important to know when confronted by a stranger (such as 'I don't speak Arabic). Here are a few important phrases:


Ana mesh batkallem arabi (I don't speak Arabic)
Ana batkallem arabi nos nos (I speak Arabic alright)
El sa'aa kam (What is the time?)
Ento men feen? Or Ento Mneen? (Where are you from-plural)
Ana men Bretanya (I am from Britain)
Ismak eh? (What is your name?)
Esmee + your name (My name is + your name)
Ana kwayes (I am good)
Mesh fahem (I don't understand)

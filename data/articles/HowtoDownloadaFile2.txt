 The default browser app for iOS devices is Safari, which is a white app with a blue compass icon on it. You can't download setup files or text files to your iPhone, but you can download photos.


You can also use Google Chrome or Firefox on your iPhone, though you must first download them from the App Store.
 To do so, tap the bar at the top of the screen, then type in the name of an item you wish to view and tap Go.
 It should be just below the search that's near the top of the screen.
 Doing so will open the photo.
 After a moment, a menu will pop up at the bottom of the screen.
 It's at the top of the pop-up menu. This will download the photo onto your iPhone.


You'll be able to find the photo in your iPhone's Photos app.

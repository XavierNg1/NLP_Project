 Set it to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius). Let it preheat. While it does, prepare a large baking sheet so your crackers don’t stick to it while baking. Use a paper towel to rub enough shortening, butter, or vegetable oil to lightly coat the whole sheet., Place your rolled oats in your blender or food processor. Use the pulse setting to blend them into flour, a few seconds at a time. Check in between each pulse to judge the flour’s consistency. Quit while it’s still coarse, rather than continue blending it into a fine powder., Add the other dry ingredients to the blender or food processor: whole wheat flour, salt, white sugar, and ground cinnamon. Stir until they are evenly mixed. Then add your wet ingredients: water and olive oil. Stir again until all ingredients have combined into a soft dough., Transfer the dough to your baking sheet. Use a rolling pin to spread and flatten it until it is about an eighth of an inch thick (0.3 cm). Then use a knife to create perforations for each cracker. Create any shape you want, but don’t slice all the way through the dough. Instead, just create lines roughly halfway deep through it., Once the oven reaches desired heat, transfer the baking sheet inside. Bake for about 10 to 15 minutes. Keep a close watch on them as they near the 10-minute mark, because they can start burning very quickly. Remove from heat once they begin to brown a little., First, set the baking sheet down on a heat-protected surface. Let the crackers cool until they are safe to touch. Then simply break them into individual crackers along your perforations.

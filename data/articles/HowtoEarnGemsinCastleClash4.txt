 Choose the level of HBD you would like to do. Here Be Demons is supposed to be you defending your base from a certain number of the same heroes attacking you. It is different from HBM since this time there is only one wave and you get a few rewards. In those rewards, you may get a chance of winning gems.
 If you want a better chance of winning gems, choose Level 10, 11, or 12. Level 12 might give you a better chance of gems since it is the hardest level, as well as the last. If you win, you may get up to 36 gems or more.
 HBD requires high experience and high leveled heroes. The new update for Castle Clash now allows your hero to get to level 200. If your heroes are 180, level them up and earn enough XP to win. You can win with level 180 heroes, but you may not get gems this way.
 To get gems, you have to have quick heroes that can kill the enemies quickly. If it takes quite a bit of time, or you lose most of your heroes (also losing most of your HP), you will get honer badges instead. You will not get gems or honer badges unless you win the whole level.

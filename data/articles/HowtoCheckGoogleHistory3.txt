 If Firefox is your main browser you can check the Google search history in much the same way as you would check it on Internet Explorer. The same rules apply, however, so donâ€™t forget that this method will only enable you to view your history on Google on the specific computer and browser you are using. This will show you your Google search history on Firefox on this computer but nothing else, unlike the Google account which tracks all your activity across browsers and devices when you are logged in.
 The browser history can be pulled up by pressing the key combination Ctrl-H.This is exactly the same as with Internet Explorer. Alternatively, you can click on the Menu button in the top right of the browser window, then select "History."

, Just as with Internet Explorer, opening the history will show you everything you have stored in your web history. You can narrow down the results again by typing "google.com" (or whatever country code is appropriate for you) into the history search window. Your Firefox Google search history on this computer will be displayed in the results.

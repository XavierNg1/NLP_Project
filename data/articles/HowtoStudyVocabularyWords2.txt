 If you're only studying a small number of words, write them down in a vertical list. Write the definition on the same line as each word, on the opposite side of the page. Test yourself by covering the definitions with a folder or book. Read each word aloud and say the definition, then slide the folder down to see whether you got it right.
 Write or type the word and the definition as many times as you can. The muscle memory will help this stick, but keep in mind that this won't help your pronunciation or ability to use the word in a sentence.
 If you're learning a foreign language, write the name of household objects on a sticky note, in that language. Over the next few days or weeks, say the name aloud each time you see or use that object.


Every once in a while, take down the labels you no longer need and put more labels on other objects.
 You'll find it easier to remember a word if you connect it to something else in your mind. It doesn't matter how silly it is; you can use anything that will make you think of the definition.


For example, the word "thespian" means "actor." Think of an actor asked to play a spy, doing "the spying'."
This works for foreign languages as well, especially ones closely related to your own language. For example, the Spanish word "cine" means "movie theater," just like "cinema" in English.
 Write the word and definition on a chalk board by dragging your finger through a layer of shaving cream. Wipe the surface flat again and try to write it from memory. Repeat many times.


This is mostly useful for teaching someone else, but the physical sensation may help some people learn.
 Write five sentences for each vocabulary word you're having trouble with. You'll get used to using it in a sentence and thus will be more likely to remember the word.


If you need to memorize words in a certain order, write a story that uses the words in that order.

Have the ball in your crosse (The Net of the stick). Start By throwing the ball from your crosse at a Brick wall, Pitch back, or some other type of surface that will send the ball back to you.

 this will help you if your teammate overthrows you in a game. Try this until you get comfortable. If you are using a brick wall, just throw it higher on the wall. Do this until you get comfortable with this.
 Start off about 10 feet (3.0 m) away from each other passing the ball back and forth. Do this until one of you drops the ball. When you drop it start over at 10 feet (3.0 m). One person should back up a few feet once you get it 5 times.
 Go in a circle and pass the ball around, like you do in drills.

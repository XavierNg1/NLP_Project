 Since the event of digital photos, the choice is endless but make your selection from only the very best photos you have.


The one exception to "only the best" is where you have no other photo of a person, pet, or place you visited than a not-so-great one and it's really important to have that photo included; see if you can Photoshop it to improve it.;
, Perhaps use a theme, such as a road trip you took, or a special event. If it's family and friends, choose photos that show them at their best, and doing things that are truly representative of them.


Other themes might be nature, pet, craft, woodwork, backyard, renovation, makeovers, etc.
 Do you want to chronological order (by age/years) or choose specific special events (such as birthdays, Christmas/Diwali/Hanukkah/school vacation time, etc.).
 While you might remember now, down the years it is easy to forget and other people who don't know anything will appreciate a little information added to the photos. There are several ways to add them - on the back or slide a note card in when you put in your pictures, or scrapbook a special card piece and add it.
 In terms of how you arrange them, that is dependent on the album. If it already has pockets or slots, you'll have to use those. If you're using a blank album and your own sticky photo tabs, arrange them as wished, perhaps in a scrapbook style, or in neat lines.


If using a pocket or slot style, check that the photos are right side up.
 Once full, place it somewhere that is easy to access by any member of the family to look at whenever they want. Enjoy viewing your memories for years to come.

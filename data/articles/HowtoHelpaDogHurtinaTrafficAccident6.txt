 Spotting a broken or fractured bone can be difficult. To do so, look for areas that are swollen, particularly on the dog’s legs. There is often swelling around the break. If the dog is moving around or walking, observe it to determine whether or not it is moving any part of its body unusually. For example, is the dog holding one leg at an odd angle? Or is one of its legs shaped differently than the others? These can all be signs of a bone injury., If the dog has a broken bone from the accident, it is important that you touch it as little as possible. Don’t ever try to reset the bone—this should only be done by a professional., Depending on the severity of the break and the size of the dog, you may be able to get the dog to a vet without splinting the injury first. If the dog is small enough, you can hold it, allowing the injured extremity to hang free. If the dog is larger and will not lay still, however, you may need to make a splint for the injury before taking it to the vet., Most bone injuries are not life threatening, but immobilizing the injury can help prevent complications. To create a splint, find a solid, straight object, like a stick or piece of wood that is long enough to extend past the joints above and below the break. Place one of the sticks or pieces of wood on each side of the broken bone and secure them in place by wrapping or tying a cloth or rope around them., If you think the dog might have a broken neck or back, it is best to wait for animal control to arrive and assist you in treating the dog. If you have to move the dog, however, do so with as little movement as possible. Try to find a flat, hard surface, like a large board, to transport the dog on.

 This will open the document in the Microsoft Word app.


You can also open Word, which is a blue app with a white "W", and click the document's name in the "Recently opened" section.
 This will take a screenshot, which will be indicated by your computer's screen dimming briefly.


If the screen doesn't dim, try pressing the "Print Screen" key firmly down and holding it for half a second or so before releasing.
The "Print Screen" key may be abbreviated (e.g., "Prt Scr", "Prt Sc", etc.).
 You can press âŠž Win to do so, or you can click the Windows icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen.
 You should see a folder labelled "Screenshots" appear at the top of the menu.
 Doing so will open it. You should see your Word document screenshot somewhere in this folder.
 This will invoke a drop-down menu.


You may have to scroll down to view the Word document depending on how many screenshots you've taken.
 It's about halfway down the drop-down menu; selecting this option with the cursor will cause a pop-out menu to appear.
 This will open the Paint app, which will allow you to convert your screenshot from the PNG format to a JPEG file.
 Since screenshotting captures your whole screen, you may wish to trim the edges off of your document. To do so:


Click Select at the top of the Paint window.
Click and drag your cursor across the part of the image you wish to save.
Click Crop (to the right of Select).
To see your whole document, you may need to zoom out by clicking the - button in the bottom-right corner of the Paint window.
 It's in the top-left corner of the Paint window.
 You'll see a menu pop out to the right.
 Doing so will save an updated copy of your screenshot as a JPEG file.

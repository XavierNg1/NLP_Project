 Log in using your Tumblr username and password to access the Tumblr dashboard.
 Tap the menu icon in the top left corner of Tumblr and select “Create New Post.”

, A new menu will appear, showing your options. Select the option that best suits your needs.


Choose “Upload an audio file” if you have an MP3 file. Files that don’t end in *.mp3 will not work in the audio uploader. Tap “Choose an audio file” to find it on your mobile device. The file must be under 10MB in size and you can only upload one audio file per day with this option.
Choose “Post audio with a URL” if the audio file you want to share is already on the web. The file cannot be a video or be embedded in another website. This option works best if you’ve uploaded your own .MP3 audio file to a website. Type or paste the full path to the audio file into the blank.
Choose “Attach audio in an email” if your .MP3 audio file is in your email account. This will launch your phone’s default email app, which will now display a new email message with a special email address to which you should send your audio file. Attach the audio file to the email.
 If you want to add text to your post, type it into the blank provided. If you chose to attach audio in an email, type the text as the body of the email.
 Tap “Post” if you chose to upload an audio file or post audio with a URL. If you’re posting audio by email, send the email message to post it to Tumblr. Once the audio is uploaded, your followers will be able to listen to the audio in their feeds.

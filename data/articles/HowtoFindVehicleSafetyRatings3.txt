 The top 5-star ranking is based on adult, child and pedestrian protection as well as safety assistance.


The adult occupant protection ranking is compiled from frontal, side and pole impact tests. Modifiers are added to the score for different-sized people in different seating positions. Also included in the score are results from the whiplash test.
The child occupant protection score is based on crash dummies representing ages 18 months and 3 years in side and frontal crash tests. Also considered is whether a child seat can fit safely and securely in the vehicle.
 ANCAP uses frontal offset, side impact, pedestrian and pole impact tests to determine vehicle ratings. ANCAP now requires that a vehicle have electronic stability control before receiving its top rating of 5 stars.
 (The website has an English version.) The tests subject vehicles to frontal collision, offset frontal and side impact. The top rating is 5 stars.

 Choose a simple black, gray or white ensemble.
 Opaque pink is great for an outfit with bold patterns because it will spiff up your nails without distracting from your clothing. An opaque pink also serves as a great alternative to a blas√© neutral color like tan.
 You'll come across as frightening instead of fashionable. Neon pink does not, for instance, go with reds, fluorescents or metallics.
 If you want to wear pastel, at least be a little bolder with your nail color. Go with lilac or sky blue.

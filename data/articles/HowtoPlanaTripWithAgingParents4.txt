 You might be frustrated by your parents’ inability to do what you do. Try to put yourself in their shoes. Recognize that their advanced age means they cannot do what you can.


When you feel yourself becoming frustrated, take in a deep breath through your nose, then blow it out through your mouth slowly over the course of five to eight seconds.
When on vacation, it does neither you nor your parents any good to get frustrated or impatient. Remember, your aging parents are not deliberately moving slowly, and are doing the best they can. Be patient!

, And while it’s always a good idea to be polite, respectful, and kind to your parents, these qualities are even more important when you’re traveling and in close proximity with your parents over the course of several days or weeks.


Try to make inconveniences into something positive. For instance, instead of bemoaning the fact that you have to move through each destination so slowly, enjoy your opportunity to really soak up the flavor of each place your travel to.Be deferential and don’t dredge up unpleasant memories unnecessarily.
Even if you and your parents don’t always see eye to eye, do your best to keep things civil while traveling together.
Think before you speak. Don’t say anything that you might regret, or that might sour the mood of your parents for the rest of the trip. Before saying something potentially upsetting, ask yourself if it might be hurtful or unpleasant.
 Be respectful and don’t insist on helping them with every piece of luggage or every step up into the train or bus. Don’t patronize. Let them ask you for help before intervening.
 As your parents age, you should become more conscious that they won’t be around forever. Take advantage of the time you have with them to make great memories and show them that you really love them.Don’t wait forever to propose a trip with your aging parents. They aren’t getting any younger.

 Use bread such as oat nut or whole grain – homemade, if possible. Cut one 3 in (7.6 cm) slice for each sandwich, using a bread knife. Then cut halfway down the center of each 3 in (7.6 cm) piece., Place the tip of a paring knife into the slice you just made. Angle the knife downward and carve out a pocket, without cutting completely through the bread.Repeat this process for each sandwich.
 Spoon one tablespoon (12 g) of peanut butter, almond butter or other nut butter into each sandwich. Arrange a few banana slices inside each pocket., Use a container, such as a large bowl, that is big enough to soak one sandwich. In the container, whisk together almond milk, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon and salt., Place each sandwich, one at a time, into the container of batter. Allow each sandwich to soak for ten seconds., Pre-heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add a thin coating of coconut oil to the skillet. Cook the bread until it’s golden brown on one side, about four to five minutes. Flip the bread with a spatula and cook the other side equally.

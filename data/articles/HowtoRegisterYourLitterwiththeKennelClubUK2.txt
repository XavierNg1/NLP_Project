 Though there is no limit on when you can register your litter, it is generally advised to do so at four weeks of age. This ensures that registration documents are available for the new owner when the puppies are old enough to be sold.If you wait until the dog is over one year, there will be a late fee.
 When you register your litter, the puppies must be given the appropriate name for the registration. You should be aware of the following rules when choosing names:Names need more than one word, but can’t go over 24 letters.
A name cannot be repeated in a breed. You also can’t have the same name of an approved Kennel Name.
You can’t use your last name. You also can’t repeat any words in the names of the puppies.
The Kennel Name must be the first word in the dog’s name.
Initials, numeric numbers, and abbreviations are not allowed. Using canine words, like dog, champion, or a breed name, is also not allowed.
 The Kennel Club registers all types of dogs, including pedigree, crossbreeds, and others. They have three different types of registers, and which one you place your dog in depends on the type of dog you have.The breed register is for pedigree dogs.
The companion dog register is for companion dogs, and is open to crossbreeds and purebreds.
The activity register is for dogs that love activities, like flyball, agility, or obedience. This register is for dogs that are not on the breed register, and it is open to crossbreeds and purebreds.

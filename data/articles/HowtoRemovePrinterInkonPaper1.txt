 Inkjet (or "bubble jet") printers spray droplets of ink onto the paper, and depending on the type of ink used and the printer, this ink may remain wet for several minutes. Immediately after printing, you may be able to pick up a small portion of the ink using a cotton ball.This can make the next step easier, even if the ink is still mostly visible on the paper.


Do not rub the paper vigorously, as it may rip.
Most home and office inkjet printers use aqueous inks, typically the cheapest option, which take a few minutes to dry unless the printer includes a heating mechanism.;
, Sometimes, the ink will remain mostly on the surface of the paper. Scrape the top level of paper off using a razor blade or ultra-fine grit sandpaper.Scrape gently in one direction only, towards yourself.


This has a greater chance of success if you try this immediately after printing. Thicker paper will also help, as it can withstand additional scraping.UV-cured inks, which tend to be more expensive and durable, are quickly bonded to the paper before they have a chance to soak in.They may be easier to scrape off than other types of printer ink.
 If the above methods do not work, you may have to give up on removing the ink. Apply whiteout instead and allow it to dry before writing or drawing over it.

 If you notice that being around other people makes you feel irritable, make sure you have some time to yourself. For example, if you attend a meeting at the same time each week with lots of people, plan some time after that doing solitary activities or working on your own. Give yourself time each day when you can be alone.If you need considerable time alone, make sure you get some time at home, school, and work. Wake up early each morning to spend some alone time. Listen to music, meditate, take a walk, read, or journal.
 If you’re feeling irritable in the moment, focus on your breathing. Make each inhale and exhale longer than normal. This can help calm your mind and your body, and decrease your irritation in the moment.Breathe in for three seconds, hold for three seconds, then breathe out for three seconds. Do this for several breaths.
If needed, excuse yourself to do some deep breathing. Go to a quiet place, close your eyes, and focus on your breath. Use imagery or progressive muscle relaxation to increase your relaxation.
 Set aside some time each day to relax. This can help calm your mind and your body, especially if you’re feeling irritable. It can help to take some time out and do a calming activity.

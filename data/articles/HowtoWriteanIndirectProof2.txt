 Here's a more mathematical example. The two statements are "A triangle can have more than one right angle" and "A triangle cannot have more than one right angle." Only one of these statements can be correct., In this case, the information needed for this proof is "the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees." This is usually proven earlier in the math textbook, or provided as a truthful statement., This is the statement that seems easiest to disprove, so this is where to start. Imagine a triangle with two right angles (angles a and b), and one unknown angle (angle c)., Each right angle is 90 degrees. Angles a and b are both right angles, so a + b = 90 + 90 = 180 degrees., Our given information states that all three angles add up to 180 degrees. This means angles a + b + c = 180 degrees. Solve for c:

'a + b + c = 180

We already found that a + b = 180, therefore 180 + c = 180.

c = 180 - 180 = 0.
 The solution that angle c is 0 degrees is impossible, since a triangle with a zero degree angle is impossible., Since you found a contradiction, the assumption "a triangle can have more than one right angle" must be false. Therefore, by indirect proof, the other statement must be correct. A triangle cannot have more than one right angle.

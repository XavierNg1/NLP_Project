 The canned pineapple supplies the moisture and sweetness provided by the milk and sugar in classic cool whip frosting recipes.


In a medium bowl, add the whipped topping, the package of pudding mix, and the drained pineapple.
Stir thoroughly to combine.
 Spread the frosting over your desired dessert with a spatula, several tablespoons at a time. Once you’ve covered the entire surface, use the spatula to smooth out the frosting and ensure that it’s evenly distributed across the surface.


You can spread this frosting on your dessert of choice, like, for example, angel food cake or pineapple cupcakes.
If you choose, you can use a butter knife or the spatula to create a wave-like design in the frosting.
Or, as an alternative, you can spoon the frosting into a pastry bag (or a plastic storage bag with a small hole cut from one of the corners), and, with a frosting tip, squeeze the frosting onto your dessert.

 Your current book cover could be mostly attached or it may be hanging on by a thread; regardless, carefully remove the entire cover including the spine from your book. Use an x-acto knife with a fresh blade to remove excess glue, ripped pages, or threads that are sticking out from the text block., Measure the covers and spine you just removed, or measure the text block itself. If you choose to do the latter, add an additional 3/8 inch to the height.
 Use the measurements you've just taken to cut out three pieces of bristol board. You should have two cover pieces and the spine.
 Select a piece of sturdy cotton or linen fabric to act as the book cloth. Place the three pieces of the bristol board onto the cloth, with 3/8 of an inch in between each cover and the spine. Measure a 1 inch margin around the entire cover, and cut out the fabric into this large rectangular shape.
 Add a thick layer of book binding glue to the backside of your board cutouts, and place them in the same location as they were when you measured the fabric. Cut the corners of the fabric off at a 45 degree angle, and fold all the edges of the fabric over onto the inside of the covers. Add more binding glue to the inside, and use a bone folder to stick the fabric in place.
 A new cover needs end pages to glue the cover to the book. Use heavy stock paper for the end pages. Use a needle to weave the thread between the new end pages and the old sections of the book.
 Add a solid layer of glue to the inside of the front cover, and place the text block on the back cover. Fold over the end page in the front, and use a bone folder to smooth it out and securely glue it to the front cover. Repeat the same process with the back cover.
 Place the book in a book press overnight to dry. Place a piece of waxed paper in between the end pages and the text block to prevent pages from sticking.

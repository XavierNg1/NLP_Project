 Some of these ways won't be apparent to you until you are actually traveling, so be ready to adjust your approach as you go. A few of the things you might like to consider in advance include:


Avoid using disposable containers and items wherever possible. Eat at places that either have eco-friendly options or where you can use your own reusable container.
Take a bottle for your water and avoid buying bottled water where it is safe to do this. Where it is not safe to do so, at least see if it's possible to refill a reusable bottle at safe water locations. Only resort to bottled water where your health would otherwise be compromised.
Stay on walking trails, don't touch cultural artifacts and the like when told not to and use your common sense about preserving human and natural heritage.
Pack it in and pack it out. Never leave your trash anywhere than the appropriate disposal places.
Never buy plant or animal products that are endangered.
Consider offsetting your unavoidable carbon footprint. Choose a reputable carbon offsetting program to do this.

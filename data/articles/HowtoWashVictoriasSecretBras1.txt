 Bras have a thin layer of a foam called the contour. The contour's job is to camouflage the main shape of the nipple and breast. At Victoria's Secret, the material used for the contour is very delicate and is very sensitive to certain products. Buy a delicate laundry soap or fabric softener to wash your bra in.;
, If you throw your bra into the washing machine with the rest of the load, it might get ruined. The cups can get squished under other items of clothing and the straps can rip. Buy a mesh bra bag to wash your VS bra in. You can purchase these bags at home stores.
 Washing your bra in cold water will be more gentle than warm or hot. The cold water will be more efficient in your household as well.
 As soon as you pull your VS bra out of the washer, straighten out the lace and shape the cups back to the original form. You can also take this time to straighten out the straps if they are twisted.
 Try to air dry you bras as much as possible. Victoria's Secret bras often shrink if they are put in the dryer. Hang the bra up by the straps or clasps and wait at least 12 hours before wearing the bra.

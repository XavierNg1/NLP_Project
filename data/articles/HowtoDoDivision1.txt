 To do long division, Place the divisor, the number you'll be dividing, outside the long division bar, and the dividend, the number that you'll be dividing it into, inside the long division bar.








Ex: 136 รท 3;
, In this case, you can't divide 3 into 1, so you need to place a 0 on the top of the division bar and keep going. Subtract 0 from 1 by placing it below the 1 and place a 1 below it since 1-0 = 0.
 Since you couldn't divide 3 into 1, 1 remains. You'll have to carry the 3 down. Now, divide 3 into 13. 3 goes into 13 4 times to make 12 with a remainder of 1, so write a 4 on top of the long division bar, to the right of the 0. Then, subtract 12 from 13 and write 1 below it, since 1 is your remainder.
 Carry the 6 down to join the 1, creating 16. Now, divide 3 into 16. You'll get 5 with another remainder of 1, because 3 x 5 = 15, and 16-15 is one.
 Your final answer is 45 with a remainder of 1, or 45 R1.

 Sentiment and passion is the basic spirit to keep any relationship alive and worth cherishing. Remember, your countenance and demeanor effects the mindset of your family members towards life and towards the family unit. Ignite the flame of felicity and glee to strengthen the bond of your family as a unit. It is not that hard to spread the vibes of buoyancy while still playing a dual role of a lover and a mother.
 Stay upbeat and bubbly, full of enthusiasm and life. Your husband will also feel exhilarated to have a jubilant and exciting partner. Play, laugh and live your life to the fullest with your husband and kids. You will find a clear change in your life once you will bring laughter and giggles in your talk and walk.
 Do this to make them feel secure and loved in the boundaries of home. Your husband will be attracted towards you naturally when he finds mental and physical peace with you.
 You must understand his feelings, desires and priorities. You should be too close to him to actually connect with his soul, the wrinkles on his forehead and a sparkle twinkling in his eye must convey the right message at the right time. You must strive to be soul mates and not only roommates.

 Here is what you need to do.


Go to the eBay homepage.
Move your mouse cursor over "Customer Support" in the top-right corner of the page and click on "Resolution Center" from the drop-down menu.
Answer the on-screen questions step-by-step to file your case with eBay. The buyer protection plan is part of eBay's refund policy that gives you full money back on purchases of $25 or more if you have been a victim of fraudulent activity and have reported the matter through the eBay Resolution Center.

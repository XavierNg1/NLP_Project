 A nine-month period is a lifetime for a toddler, so it's best not to drop the news until you have the tummy to show for it. That way, he won't anticipate and fret over the baby's birth so much.;
, Once he knows, don't push him to grow up. If he's in diapers, forget potty training for now; if he's still in a crib, don't switch him to a big kid bed. He'll feel like he's being replaced, not promoted.
 Do all you can to make the baby a reality for the child. Have him talk or sing to your belly. Let him feel the baby moving around in there. If possible, bring him to your prenatal checkups, and ask the doctor to let him listen to the baby's heartbeat.
 Ask him for baby name ideas, or let him pick out something special for the nursery.
, Tell him what he was like as a newborn. Explain that, just like him, the baby will be a big kid someday.
 Choose one that is about the size of a newborn and is as lifelike as possible. Show him how to take care of it so that he'll understand what you're doing when the new baby comes along. It'll help him to realize that his new brother or sister will be very fragile and will need lots of care.
 When friends come to visit the new baby and bring gifts, they will probably bring gifts for your toddler, too. If not, you can keep your toddler from becoming jealous by pulling out a gift from your secret stash.
 When the new baby comes, put your toddler in charge of making sure that visitors are gentle with the baby. This will, he'll behave well, too.
 Read to your child while nursing your infant, or play make-believe with him while changing the baby's diaper. It's important that your toddler doesn't feel left out when the new baby seems to be getting all the attention and care.

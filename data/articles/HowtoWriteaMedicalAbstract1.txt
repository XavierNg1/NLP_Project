 Review the information in the book AMA Manual of Style: Guide for Authors and Editors. This book will have detailed information on how to formulate an abstract that is constructed correctly. You can also access it online at http://www.amamanualofstyle.com/

, Pay attention to tone, length, and structure of other medical abstracts, especially ones related to research in your field or abstracts published in the journal for which you are writing the abstract.
 Be sure you are completely knowledgeable and comfortable with the larger project or paper that the medical abstract is summarizing. Read it a few times, and practice explaining it to others. If you are writing a medical abstract on behalf of someone else, consult them with any questions you may have about the research.
 If you’re publishing an abstract for a conference presentation, contact the university or professional society for directions. Your abstract will probably need to stay within a certain word count, usually 100 – 400 words, so be as direct as possible in your writing., Cramming meaningful text about a large medical study or research project into a limited space can be challenging, while talking at length about the many details of the project is easy. Give yourself a head start on your medical abstract by getting it down well in advance of its due date.


If you have co-authors on the publication, have them look over a draft of the abstract before submitting it.
If you don’t have co-authors, submit a draft of the abstract to a peer in your field of research, or a trusted mentor knowledgeable about the abstract submission and publication process.

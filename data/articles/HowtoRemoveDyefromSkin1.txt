 Once you finish dying your hair, you need to act fast to remove any dye on your hands or on your hairline so it does not soak into your skin. Dye that is absorbed into your skin will be very difficult to remove and require a lot of scrubbing., Baking soda is great at breaking down the dyeâ€™s active ingredients and is only mildly abrasive. It will act like an all natural scrub for your hands and your hairline.However, if you have sensitive skin, only apply a little baking soda mixed with water to your skin and rub lightly. If your skin turns red or feels irritated, try a different method.
You can add lemon juice to the baking soda and water for a more powerful all natural stain remover.
 Most commercial dyes will break down when you apply oil-based products on them and lift off of your skin. Olive oil, baby oil, or an oil-based moisturizer all work well to help remove dye.

Rinse it off with warm water. Check if the dye is still on your skin. If so, apply the oil-based product again and let it soak for a longer period of time before rubbing and washing off the oil.

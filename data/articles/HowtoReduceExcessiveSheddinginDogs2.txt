 Grooming removes excess and loose fur and redistributes your dog's skin oils into its fur, helping it stay in place.Depending on your dog's fur type, you can use a bristle or slicker brush, or a rake.Bristle brushes are best for short-haired, smooth-coated dog breeds such as many terriers, Pugs, and Greyhounds. These brushes look similar to bristle brushes for human hair.
Slicker brushes are good for many dog breeds with medium or curly hair, including retrievers, Cocker Spaniels, and St. Bernards. These brushes have tiny, tightly-packed short wire pins.
Rakes are best for dog breeds with long hair and thick undercoats, such as Collies, German Shepherds, and Chow Chows. When buying a rake, make sure its pins are roughly as long as your dog's fur to ensure that it adequately thins dead undercoats.
 Use de-shedding tools just prior to spring when dogs' winter coats begin to fall off, and again in the fall when winter coats begin growing in. Dogs who live indoors most or all of the time may shed year-round.For dogs with short coats, you can likely use a rubber curry comb to de-shed. Dogs with long or thick coats will probably require tools like an undercoat de-matting rake or shedding blade., Regular baths encourage loose hair to fall out in the tub (or outside) instead of on your furniture. However, over-bathing can cause dry skin, which causes fur to fall out. Research your dog's breed to learn about the suggested bathing schedule, or ask your veterinarian.


Blow-drying after a bath can be helpful if your dog has a long coat. Use only the lowest heat setting (or a cool setting, if there is one). Towel-dry your dog first, then use the blow dryer to help remove loose fur., Dogs with flea problems scratch incessantly, which causes hair to fall out. Keeping your dog free of fleas will prevent irritated skin, dandruff and excessive fur shedding.

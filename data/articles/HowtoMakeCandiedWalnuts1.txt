 On your stovetop, place a medium size non-stick skillet on the burner. Turn the heat to medium, and allow the pan to fully heat, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes., When the pan is heated, stir in 1 cup (108 g) of shelled walnuts, ¼ cup (50 g) of white sugar, and 1 tablespoon (14 g) of unsalted butter. Allow the mixture to cook for approximately 5 minutes on medium, stirring often to ensure that it cooks evenly.You want to cook the walnut mixture until the sugar melts and all of the nuts are coated with the syrup.
It’s especially important to stir the mixture near the end of the cooking time because that’s when the nuts are most likely to burn.
You can easily double the recipe if you want.
 When all of the walnuts are coated in the sugar and butter syrup, take the pan off the burner. Transfer the nuts from the pan to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Make sure to separate all of the nuts as you lay them out because they will stick together in a clump if they’re touching when they cool.Use two spatulas or wooden spoons to separate the nuts quickly so they don’t have a chance to stick together.
 Once the walnuts are spread out in a single layer, let them cool for approximately 10 minutes or until the coating on the outside hardens. Place them in a bowl, and serve as a snack.If you don’t plan to eat the candied walnuts right away, be sure to store them in an airtight container.

 Be sure to include your child in the brainstorming process.
 Think outside the box and get creative with the meals you pack.


Replace 2 slices of bread with a pita or tortilla wrap when making sandwiches.






Pack breakfast foods or other non-traditional lunch items.






Offer a bunch of healthy items instead of just a sandwich and a snack. As long as your child is receiving all of the nutrients he needs, his lunch does not have to consist of a traditional meal. Instead, offer a lunchbox full of healthy snacks, such as some fruit, a handful of healthy cereal, a homemade trail mix, carrots and dip, cheese slices, etc.

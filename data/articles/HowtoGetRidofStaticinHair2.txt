 Hairbrushes create more friction in your hair and combs create less friction.


A wide-tooth comb has teeth placed far enough apart to reduce the amount of friction. By contrast, a brush has bristles that are held close together, so electrical charges in the form of friction build up faster.
 While combs are better than brushes, metal combs are even better than plastic combs.


Plastic combs supposedly contribute to the static problem.
Metal combs cause the electric charges building in your hair to discharge, thereby reducing the amount of static present.



Natural brushes do a more effective job of spreading your natural oils through your hair. These oils will coat each strand of hair, locking in the moisture and preventing a good amount of static.
As an added benefit, your hair will also look shinier and smoother.
 Ionic hair dryers cut down on the amount of time and heat used to dry your hair. As such, your hair is exposed to less dry, hot air, minimizing the amount of moisture that gets lost.


Additionally, ionic dryers supposedly neutralize electric charges in your hair. These electric charges are responsible for static, so the dryer cuts down on the overall amount of static directly.
When you blow dry your hair, stop once it reaches a partially dry, partially damp state. Let the rest of it dry naturally by air. Your locks will lose less moisture this way.

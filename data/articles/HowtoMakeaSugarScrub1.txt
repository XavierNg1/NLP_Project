 You'll need a small container to mix and keep your sugar scrub in. Find a clean container with a lid that you can spare for at least a few days until you've used all of your scrub.


This recipemakes about 2/3 of a cup of scrub, although you can double it to make more. Size your container appropriately.;
, Pour 3 tablespoons of olive oil into your container.


You can also add 1-2 gel caps of vitamin E oil if you want to make this scrub even better for your skin. Simply piece the cap and squeeze it into the oil. If you do this, however, make sure you let the scrub soak on your skin for a few minutes before rinsing it off.
 Now, add in 2 tablespoons of honey. Any kind will do, but the thicker the honey is, the better.
 Pour in 1/2 cup of real sugar. This can be any sugar but raw sugar will be the most harsh while white sugar will be the least harsh. Brown sugar falls somewhere in the middle.
 Now that you have all of your ingredients in the container, mix everything together. If it seems to wet, you can add more sugar. If it's really dry, try adding half a spoon of oil.


Store the finished product out on your counter or in a cupboard. Putting it in the fridge will only make it go hard.

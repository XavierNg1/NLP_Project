 Although treats are a great way to reward your dog, it should not supplement too much of his daily food intake. This could throw off his nutrition balance and cause him to gain weight. The best rule of thumb is to only let treats take up 10% or less of his daily calorie intake.


The treats can be given at any time of the day, but in between meals is most common. It depends on you and your dog's preference.
The amount of treats will vary depending on how much your dog should eat every day and on the kinds of treats you choose. For example, you can feed him more carrots than commercial dog because of calorie content., If you are having trouble controlling the amount of treats you are feeding your dog every day, split any treats into smaller pieces. This will make it feel like you are giving him more treats than you actually are.


If you are worried, figure out his daily portion of treats and set them aside so you don't go over., Feel free to change up the treats you give your dogs every day. Over time, if you notice your dog likes one type more than one types, give him those kinds of treats more often than others.


If there are some healthier snacks that you want to feed your dog that aren't your dog's favorite, feed those to him first and save his favorites for later in the day.Make sure you keep track of how many calories he eats in treats.

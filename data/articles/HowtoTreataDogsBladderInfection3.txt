 In recurrent cases of cystitis, it is often possible to identify an inciting cause of infection, such as urinary crystals, a bladder stone, a bladder polyp or cancer. Because of this, it is important to take your dog to the vet if you think he has a bladder infection.
 If bladder crystals are present, often changing the urine pH and putting the dog onto a urinary diet will resolve the problem.


If bladder stones, a pile up of bladder crystals, are present then surgical removal is essential.
 Bladder polyps can be removed, or sometimes resolved, of their own accord if the dog is put onto an anti-inflammatory medication such as meloxicam. This is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can help to reduce inflammation.


The dose of metacam is 0.05 mg/kg by mouth, with or after food, once daily. The oral suspension contains 1.5mg/ml and so a typical 30k g Lab requires 1 ml daily with his food., Unfortunately, bladder cancer tends to grow in an area of the bladder called the trigone. This is a vital area where the ureters are plumbed in, which makes bladder cancers poor candidates for excisional surgery.

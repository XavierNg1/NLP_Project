 Most nail salons offer pedicure packages that include procedures that will soften the feet. For example, they will ask you to soak your feet in warm water before painting your toenails. They will then use a scraper to get the dead skin off your feet, including your heels, before proceeding. To minimize risk of infection, you should ask for a morning appointment.
Ask the salon about the different packages because sometimes deluxe packages offer more scrubs and procedures that will soften your feet (and your legs too). These pedicures can be fairly expensive, though, and need to be done at least once a month.
 Your feet are going to get pretty rough if you’re walking around barefoot a lot – especially outside. So wear shoes, and you’ll have less work to do in order to soften them.


Harsh sunlight and dust also damages the feet (and the hands too). Wear socks with your tennis shoes, too.
They might look nice, but let’s face it – high heels are absolutely brutal on your feet. So wear them sparingly – just for special occasions, perhaps.
 Doing regular foot exercises can help keep your feet softer and healthier. They stimulate blood circulation, and this can make feet less dry. Use your hands to rotate your feet clockwise and then counter-clockwise. Do this 10 times on each side.
Exercise your toes by stretching them outwards and then backwards. You should also do this exercise 10 times each.
Drink a lot of water in addition to regularly exercising the feet. Hydrating the body makes the skin healthier and softer all the way around.

 Insurance providers are rated for financial strength and reputability by a handful of ratings firms. These ratings firms are TheStreet.com, Standard & Poor's, Moody's, Fitch, and A.M Best Company. Not every insurance company will have a rating with all agencies, but it is important to get ratings from each one that you can before purchasing from an insurance provider, especially if the provider is not well known. Be sure to also look into what the ratings terms mean for each rating firm.

Firms assign ratings on different scales, with some using "A+" to denote their highest rating and others using "AAA."

In general, an assessment of "secure" (rather than the alternative, "vulnerable") is a positive indicator of provider performance.,  When you purchase your first house, it is probably time to consider purchasing term life insurance.  This allows the co-borrower on your mortgage to receive a death benefit that would cover any living expenses and to keep paying the mortgage.  If for some reason you cannot meet the underwriting criteria for term life insurance, purchase mortgage protection insurance.  This pays the beneficiary enough to pay off the mortgage on the house in the event of your death.,  Once you are expecting your first child, you need a life insurance policy to protect your family in the event of your death.  Your beneficiary can use the death benefit to maintain the same standard of living for your children without having to worry about replacing your income.  Choose a policy that is sizable enough to pay for at least 18 years of child-rearing and household expenses.  In addition, you can provide enough to cover college tuition.

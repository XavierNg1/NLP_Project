 Think about how long you were unemployed. Does it merit getting addressed in your cover letter? These days, it is not uncommon for employment searches to take six months. Several years of unemployment will raise questions. Many employers may fear this gap is prison time or a job you are unable to list on your resume due to gross negligence.
 Smaller gaps do not likely need to be addressed at this stage. If you have had longer gaps between employment, you may wish to address them in your cover letter. If you feel you must, then make sure to do so in brief., When there are large gaps of unemployment, or even more than one gap in employment, you may wish to choose a different resume format. A functional resume lists work experience in skill/position-related categories, as opposed to chronologically. In this way you highlight the nature of your work experience.Create categories like “Customer Service Experience” and “Managerial Experience”. This will avoid highlighting any gaps of time.
Omit months. Especially when you have worked jobs for a number of years, this can give you a little bit of wiggle room around the start and end of employment.
List positions held for the longest amount of time first. This will show off your commitment, and your ability to responsibly hold a job for long periods of time.

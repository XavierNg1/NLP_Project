 This is a simple but very effective topping for a not-too-fancy slice.;
, This is ideal for chocolate based slices.
 The nicest icing for slices is that flavored with natural flavors, such as fresh orange or lemon juice, passionfruit pulp, or pulped berries. Other good additions to icing include coffee and Milo.
 Any of the chocolate range is suitable from white to milk to dark chocolates. Simply melt in a double boiler, then spoon over the slice. For added effect, rake a fork over the top to make waves.
 Ice with plain icing first, then sprinkle the cinnamon sugar. Or leave off the icing and just sprinkle the cinnamon sugar direct if the slice is porous enough.
 Desiccated coconut is best, and you might need to add plain icing first.
 This is suitable for a slice that is going to be eaten immediately, such as at a party. If not, use glazed (glac√©) fruit instead.

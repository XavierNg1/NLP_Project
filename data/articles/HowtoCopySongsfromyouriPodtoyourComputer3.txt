 iTunes should now bring you to the page where you can manage your device.


You should see info like the name and software version of your iPod, iPhone, or iPad, as well as storage information and preferences.
 From there, check "Enable disk use”.


iTunes will prompt you with a warning so just select “OK”.
This method works for both Mac and PC.
 You can now find your iPod on your operating system as a disk. This means that you have enabled your iDevice to act like an external hard drive that you can use to move files around.


However, due to Apple’s restrictive nature, you still may not be able to access your music in your files without a bit of work.
 Click on the "Organize" tab and from the drop down menu select "Folder and Search Options". Click the "View" tab in the window that just opened.


Search the list for "Hidden Files and Folders" and make sure there is a check in the "Show hidden files and folders" check box.



In your Finder type in “Terminal” and then open the application. Once the dialogue box is running type: “defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES”. Press ↵ Enter. Then, hold the Option/alt key and right click on your finder icon, click relaunch.
You should always use extreme caution using Terminal as it grants you advanced access to your computer that can potentially do a lot of damage if used incorrectly.
 Go into iPod_control > Music. You will now see all of the music stored on your iPod.
 You can also copy and paste them to the music folder in your itunes file.If you’re on a Mac you can find your iTunes Music folder from the Finder by clicking Go (in your top bar) > Home > Music > iTunes > iTunes Media > Music. Once that is open simply drag, or paste your copied music files into the folder.
On Windows, navigate to your “Users” folder and from there, your username > My Music > iTunes. And simply copy over your music files.

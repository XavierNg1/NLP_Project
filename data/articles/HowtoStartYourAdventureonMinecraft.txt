 You can plan your adventure anywhere: on paper, on notepad, etc. You will need to put down the different resources you will take on your adventure. Take stuff you will need rather than stuff you don't necessarily need and fill up your inventory. You may not even need a bed in any of your adventures. You will at least need to leave half of your inventory free so you can pick up other items during your adventure. A good inventory of resources might be: Crafting table, furnace, bed, weapons, tools, Eye of Ender (for strongholds), diamonds, cobblestone, dirt, and food.;
, Make sure you at least have seven things: dirt, cobblestone, food, crafting table, furnace, tools, armour.
 You are ready to start your adventure. If anything comes your way, react quickly. Remember adventuring is a way of life in Minecraft and skipping this step will lead to failure (death).

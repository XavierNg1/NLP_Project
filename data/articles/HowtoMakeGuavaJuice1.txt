 Wash several red or pink guavas. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin. While you can leave the peel on, it will make the juice thicker and grittier. Chop the guavas into chunks. You should end up with 1 cup (165 g).Use guavas that are soft and free of spots or blemishes.;
, Put the chopped guava into a blender or food processor. Add 1 teaspoon (4 g) of sugar and 1/2 cup (120 ml) of cold water. Put the lid on the blender or processor.You could substitute your favorite low-calorie or natural sweetener for the sugar.
 Blitz the guava mixture just until the guava is smooth and mixed with the water. Avoid blending the mixture for too long or the seeds will become finely ground. This will make it difficult to strain them out and your guava juice will be gritty., Set a fine mesh strainer over a bowl. For even smoother juice, line the strainer with cheesecloth. Scoop the guava mixture into the strainer and use a spoon to gently push the mixture through it.You can discard the tiny, hard seeds that are left in the strainer.
 Place several ice cubes into 2 small serving glasses. Pour the strained guava juice into the glasses and serve it immediately.

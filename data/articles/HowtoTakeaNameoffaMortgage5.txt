 An assumption of a mortgage is basically a “take over” of the entire mortgage by one person and removes the name of the other person from the mortgage. The person staying on the mortgage keeps the original interest rate, repayment period, balance and terms. Loans issued by the Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs are generally assumable. Many conventional loans are not assumable. You can check with your lender to see if it is an option., If that person agrees, have him or her gather documentation showing financial ability to pay the mortgage. Such documentation might include past tax returns, pay stubs, and bank statements.
 Follow the lender’s instructions on how to obtain an assumption. The person staying on the mortgage will need to send in proof he or she can pay the monthly debt alone.
 If the lender approves the assumption request, it will send an assumption agreement. It is advisable to have an attorney review the document to ensure when executed, you are no longer on the mortgage. The attorney can also draft and file property records showing you no longer own the property.

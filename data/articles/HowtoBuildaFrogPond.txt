 A good spot to build a pond is under the shade of a tree but with some direct sunlight. Frogs however, like a pond with plenty of shade and an area with enough plants to attract insects for food.;
, You can choose how big your pond is going to be and how deep you want it. Though you will want to make it a reasonable size. If you don't mind the time, work and effort you can make the pond bigger which attracts more frogs.
 The plastic will stop the water from sinking into the dirt and keep it in place. Other than plastic you can also leave a cement mix to dry inside the hole, this will also keep the water in place.
 Try to fill the hole to the brim with the hose water. If it's in a rainy season and you have patience you could wait until the rain water fills the hole up.

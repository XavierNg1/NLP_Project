 Let your carrier know that you’d like to sell your plan, and find out what’s needed to put that into effect. You may be told that this can be done with what’s known as an Assumption of Liability. This is a transaction that legally transfers your existing contract to another person.The person taking over your plan will most likely be instructed by your carrier to read the carrier’s Terms and Conditions of Agreement, and agree to abide by them.
Your carrier may also have an Assumption of Liability form, which will probably have to be signed both by you and the person taking over the contract.
 The odds are that you either know someone, or have access to someone, who’s looking to change his or her cellphone plan. Ask around to your friends and family. You could also post a query on your social media sites. Obviously, make sure you’re dealing with someone who’s reliable and financially stable, if you expect the carrier to approve the change., If you’re not having any success finding someone to buy your plan, you might want to look into swapping plans, in which case you literally switch your plan with someone else’s. You’re a bit more limited in this scenario, because you’ll need to find an individual who currently has a plan you’re interested in—and vice versa., If you either don’t know anyone to sell your plan to or swap with, or you’d just as soon not be bothered looking around, there are services that will do it for you.


Conduct a browser search, and you’ll find a number of companies willing to assist you. However, expect to pay a fee for the service.Obviously, do your homework on the company you’re thinking of using. Ask around to see if anyone you know has ever used the company before. You can also do a BBB search to see if the company is listed there, and what its rating is.

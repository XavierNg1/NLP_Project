 Fine lines and wrinkles appear as you age because your skin becomes drier. If you use a moisturizer every day, you help trap water in your skin. This can help keep the skin around your eyes hydrated and supple, which can minimize the appearance of crow’s feet.Look for a moisturizer that contains plant oils, shea butter, ceramides, or glycerin.;
, Retinoid creams can help reduce the appearance of crow’s feet by increasing collagen production. Collagen is a protein that helps secure the structure of skin cells. Retinoids are available over-the-counter in department stores, beauty shops, and pharmacies and are labeled as retinol. Stronger products are available with a prescription. Talk to your doctor about incorporating a prescription retinoid into your skin care routine., Exfoliators that contain alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) can help stimulate collagen production while removing dead skin cells.These products can be found in beauty shops and pharmacies.


Stronger AHA products can be prescribed by your doctor or dermatologist, but these high concentrations should not be used around the delicate skin near the eye.Use an AHA product around the eye, but do not apply it to the eyelid or directly beneath the eye.

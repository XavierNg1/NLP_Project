 It can be clothes in which the baby was baptized, the clothes in which she left the hospital, or a piece of clothing that is particularly beautiful and sweet. The item could have sentimental value for you, or you could choose a piece that you think is the prettiest or cutest.


Add the important details. In addition to clothing, you can add a photo of your child wearing those clothes. You could also put the shoes that went with the clothes on display next to the item of clothing.;
, It is very important that the baby clothes be thoroughly washed and dried before they are framed. Even something that is not visible, such as perspiration, can ruin the clothes over time. If it is possible, the clothes should also be pressed to remove any wrinkles so that they look impressive inside the frame.


When pressing the clothes, do not use any chemicals, as these could cause the clothes to become discolored over time. Instead, a light spritz of water can be used to remove stubborn wrinkles.
 There are two basic ways to frame baby clothes, which will be covered in the next two sections. It is mostly a personal choice as to the desired appearance of the finished display. However, you also needs to take into consideration the thickness of the clothes.


First, the parent can use a regular picture frame. This method can be used for very thin or small pieces of clothing. If the parent chooses to use this method for framing larger baby clothes, only a small section of the clothing will be visible. Very thick clothes do not work well in this type of frame because they are too bulky when folded to fit the frame. Using a picture frame is covered in Method 2.
Another way to frame baby clothes is to use a shadow box with a glass front. This will display the entire front of the article of clothing and can even be used to display an entire outfit. This is also the better method for framing baby clothes that are thick and hard to fold. Using a shadow box is covered in Method 3.

 Stale and slightly hardened bread is ideal for breadcrumbs. Cutting it into smaller pieces and leaving it in an open bowl will help dry it out.;
, Pulse the food processor until you have coarse crumbs. Donâ€™t pulse too long or you will have powder instead of crumbs.
, Add them to the heated butter or oil. When the butter starts to bubble, turn off the burner.


Allow the garlic to sit in the butter for three to five minutes. It will infuse the liquid.
 Sprinkle your breadcrumbs on the butter. Toss them with a wooden spoon.


If you want cheesy bread topping, add grated parmesan cheese.,, You can also cook them on a baking sheet for 15 minutes on 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 Celsius).

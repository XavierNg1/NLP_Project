 The basic adjective for "clean" in Spanish is limpio. If the noun the adjective describes is feminine, you would use limpia. If the adjective describes a plural noun, add an s.For example, if you've just washed the dishes, you might say "los platos estan limpios," which means "the dishes are clean."

Limpio also is used in Spanish if you're describing someone who was a formerly addicted to drugs or alcohol but went to rehab and is now "clean," meaning they no longer do drugs or drink alcohol. For example, you might say "Tras un mes desintoxicándose, estaba limpio," or "After a month in rehab, he was clean."

, Sometimes in English you might use the word "clean" to mean pure, such as when you're talking about air or water. In Spanish, the word "limpio" is also used in this sense, but more often the word "puro" is used.Change the word to "pura" if you're using the word to describe a feminine noun, and add an s if the noun is plural.
For example, if you wanted to say "the water is clean," you might say "es agua pura." You also might say "el agua está limpia."

, Similarly to English, "clean" is sometimes used in Spanish to describe how someone acted or how someone behaves. This is like saying "fairly" in English.For example, you might say "este equipo siempre juega limpio," which means "this team always plays clean," to talk about a team that always plays fairly or never cheats.

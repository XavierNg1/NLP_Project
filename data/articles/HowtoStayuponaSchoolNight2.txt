 If you parents are looking for reasons to say “no” to you, school will probably be their biggest concern. Prove to them that your schoolwork won’t suffer by getting all of the necessary projects and studying done in advance of the night that you plan to stay up.When you get home from school, homework and studying should be your first priority. If your parents see that you take school seriously, they’ll be more likely to believe that you handle staying up late for the night.
If you’re asking for a permanent change to your bedtime, make sure to stay on top of your homework and do well on any tests for several weeks to a month before you ask your parents.
 If you know that there’s a certain night that you want to stay up, try to get some extra sleep beforehand. Your parents will want to know that you’re well-rested if you going to lose a few hours of sleep, and being sleep-deprived before the night even starts will only make it that much harder to wake up the morning after. Go to bed as early as possible the days leading up your big night, so you won’t be tired when you start.You might want to make a point of going to bed early the night before, so your parents know that you’re trying to take care of yourself.
 If you want something from your parents, offering to do some work around the house can often help because they’ll see that you’re willing to earn the privilege of staying up. That means doing more than your usual chores, though. Tell your parents that you’re willing to take on a little extra work in order to stay up.When you’re talking to your parents, you might say, “I’m willing to wash the dishes every night this week if I can stay up” or “I’ll walk the dog for the rest of the month if you let me stay up tomorrow.”
If you’re negotiating for a permanent change to your bedtime, you may need to take on extra responsibilities indefinitely. For example, you might offer to be the one to take the garbage out from now on or to wash your parents’ cars once a month.

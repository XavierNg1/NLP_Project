 With the subject's arm extended straight out, place the goniometer over the elbow joint and above the top of the arm.


The subject should extend the arm straight out to the side so that it runs perpendicular to the line of the body. The forearm should point down. Keep the shoulder, arm, and wrist straight.
Both goniometer arms should be closed and positioned over the forearm. The center pin should rest directly over the elbow joint.
 Instruct the subject to bend the elbow joint inward and toward the body. When the subject reaches the full extension of this joint, extend the movable arm of the goniometer to match the new position of the subject's forearm.


Do not move the stationary arm or pin of the goniometer while measuring.
Take the measurement by noting the rotation value that sits beneath the center line of the movable arm. The value itself should be marked on the center dial of the goniometer.

The full rotation exists between 0 and 180 degrees, but the expected rotation should be around 150 degrees.

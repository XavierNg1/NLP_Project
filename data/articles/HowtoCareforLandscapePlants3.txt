If you have sandy soil that is unable to hold much water in reserve for your plants, you’ll need to water more often than if you have loamy soil that can hold plenty of moisture.
Your flowers will communicate their watering needs to you. All flowers will wilt if they receive either too little or too much water. Your flowers will most probably wilt a bit in the mid-day sun, but that is to be expected and is only temporary. Flowers wilting after the heat of the day has subsided indicates that there is a serious water shortage.
If you are not sure your flowers are wilting because they need water, you can check the soil by digging down a few inches and feeling it. If the soil is still moist several inches below the surface, you don’t need to water.
 Keep a rain gauge to track the rainfall and then water your flowers more if they need it.
 Turn your hose on low, so that there is little more than a trickle of water coming out, and place the hose near the plant. Let the water drip into the soil for several hours so that the water reaches the deep roots of your larger trees and shrubs.

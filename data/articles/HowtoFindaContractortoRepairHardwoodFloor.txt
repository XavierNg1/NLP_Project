 You might have seen a beautiful flooring design from a home magazine or the Internet, and want to imitate that same look in your house. Sketch your ideas and detail it so when you find your contractor, you can easily recall the things you want to be done.;
, You can either ask someone you know if they could recommend you to one. Or if there is none, you could always rely on the Yellow Pages or the Internet for resources. And do not ever forget to look for licensed permits from the local office.
 Call them up. Set up a meeting. Discuss your project. Ask them for an estimate. Do not settle with one hardwood flooring installation contractor. If you can accommodate three bidding contractors the better.
 Do not ever rely on phone-based quotation or Internet-based quotations. As a true contractor, they will insist on seeing your place to see the scale of your house’s flooring. And if they did, then let them evaluate. Seeing the scope of the projects gives the contractor’s estimator an approximate amount of the cost of your hardwood flooring project.
 Knowing how the contractors worked with their previous customer can help your decision on whom to pick on the bidding. Customer service is one of the many essential factors you should consider when hiring a contractor.
 It should contain the following details: the company’s name and particulars; detailed project description; materials list; a statement that “all necessary permits and inspections are the responsibility of the contractor”; starting and completion dates; warranties guaranteed by the contractor; a guarantee that the contractor carries liability insurance and worker’s compensation coverage; a statement that the contractor shall be held responsible for clean-up; total price and payment schedule, if applicable; and the contractor's license number.
 And know how you’re going to pay the contractor. Is it an hourly basis? Is it by the task? Ask before you leap in.

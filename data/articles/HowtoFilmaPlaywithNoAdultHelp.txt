 You can either write your play, or use one from a book. For example, one could take "The Miracle Worker.";
, See how many you need, and if any character could be played by the same person.
 You can get friends to family, as long as they promise to stick to their character and not quit on you.
 Remember, it may take the whole day.
 If it's from a playbook, have everyone get one, or you can type the scenes on your own. That's easier, so you can change any parts that don't fit, improvise, and get rid of old language. Stick to stuff more this century.
 If your friends and cast member live farther away from you, you can connect with them by email and phone. If they aren't answering their calls, OR emailing you back important information you send, call them a million times until they do, and force them to check their email for changes and scripts.
 Have one person be in charge of most of the costumes and props. Have people in the group bring any props they can that fit the setting.
 Make sure you have enough film. If you have a set time and date, on that day have everyone come with their stuff, and you're on your own.

 Add the dried lemon, peppercorns, and salt to the bowl of a food processor. Quickly stir them together with a fork.


Use a spice grinder or coffee grinder if you do not have a food processor.
Since the dried spices used in this version are larger in size, you'll need to grind them down into finer pieces before you can use them together as a spice blend.
If you need to watch your salt intake, you can reduce or omit the salt used in this recipe. You can also adjust the amount of lemon and pepper as desired.
 Process the mixture in several short bursts, continuing until everything is finely ground and evenly combined.Pause to stir the mixture as needed if some of the spices do not reach the blades on their own.
Pulsing the spices in this manner should grind them down while simultaneously mixing them together.
 Scoop the lemon pepper seasoning into an airtight jar. Store the blend in a cool, dry area for up to six months.

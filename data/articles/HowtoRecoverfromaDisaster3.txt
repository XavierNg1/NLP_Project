 Never approach or attempt to help the animal yourself. Also, never corner wild animals or try to rescue them. Wild animals will likely feel threatened and may endanger themselves by dashing off into flood waters, fire, and so forth.
 Wild animals such as snakes, opossums, and raccoons often seek refuge from flood waters on upper levels of homes and have been known to remain after water recedes. If you encounter animals in this situation, open a window or provide another escape route and the animal will likely leave on its own. Do not attempt to capture or handle the animal. Should the animal stay, call your local animal control office or wildlife resource office.
 Animal carcasses can present serious health risks. Contact your local emergency management office or health department for help and instructions. If bitten by an animal, seek immediate medical attention.

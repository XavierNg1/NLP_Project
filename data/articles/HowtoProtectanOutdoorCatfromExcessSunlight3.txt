 Cats with flat faces, such as Persians or other exotics, are vulnerable to heatstroke because they cannot pant properly. Young, old, and overweight cats are also at risk.If you are worried about sunlight or heat with an at-risk cat, you may consider moving them inside for the summer, when they are most susceptible to heatstroke.
 Cats can become dehydrated in the heat. This is especially true if they have been out in direct sunlight for a long time. Put out a bowl of water for the cat. Change this water daily so that it is clean. This will help the cat hydrate throughout the day., Heatstroke can happen if the cat’s body temperature is above 104 degrees F (40° C). Cats can get overheated if they spend too long in the sun and heat. It is important to understand the signs of overheating so that you can save the cat before it is too late. These symptoms include:


Panting.
Wheezing.
Drooling.
Stumbling.
Collapsing.
Seizures.
Vomiting., If you notice symptoms of heat stroke in the cat, take the cat into a shaded area. Pour cool, but not cold, water over the cat. You can do this from a garden hose, a watering can, a sink, or a bathtub. Make sure that the water pressure is gentle and light. This will slowly bring the cat’s temperature down. Take their temperature every fifteen minutes until their body has returned to a safe range of 100.5 to 102.5 degrees F (38-39 C).You can take the cat’s temperature from their anus. It may take up to two minutes to get a reading.
 If the cat has signs of heatstroke, take them to a vet. Even if you have returned the cat’s body temperature to normal, you may want to check to make sure that they do not have permanent damage.On the way to the vet, you can stick towels soaked in cool (but not cold) water to their feet and belly area. This will help cool the pet while you are getting them help.

 Every artist wants to avoid being labeled or putting themselves into a box, however if you can't clearly communicate your personal message to someone else, it will become increasingly harder to stick out in a crowd.;
, Your product is you! You are the most unique brand in the world and there is not another person out there like you. You have your own style, personality and set of creative tools that make you one of a kind. So love what you do and do what you love.
 What makes what you do different from everyone else? Do you paint with your feet? Do you write and record songs in some unique fashion? What makes what you do and how you do it compelling and unique?

, How do you want to be remembered? What contribution do you want to make in your field or industry? How are you accomplishing this?

, The romantic notion of the starving artist is a thing of the past. If the last decade has taught us nothing else, it has at least taught us that content is king and that there are big dollars to be made in music, ideas, films and culture. There is nothing wrong with mixing creativity with commerce, in fact many of the biggest businesses in the world are thriving on this unique mix.
 If you don't tell people about you and your work, who's going to? Don't be a basement Brian Wilson. You know, someone who never shares their genius with the world because of fear or insecurity. Everyone deals with fear and insecurity, but if you believe in your product, get out there and tell the world about it.
 Don't wait around for someone else to do it for you. If no one is responding to your portfolio, create your own show at a local coffee shop. Be inventive, you are creative right? So don't wait around, make it happen.
 Risk it all, without risk there is no reward, in fact some say that the risk is the reward. Go for it and give it all you've got. So get out there and do something today.

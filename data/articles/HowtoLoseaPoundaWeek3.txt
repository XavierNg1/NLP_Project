 To scorch that body fat, doing steady aerobic exercise is rule #1. A brisk walk most days of the week is a good place to start. And if you can run, even better. Aim for at least 30 minutes of activity 5 days a week to make your goal easily achievable (and to reap the health benefits).


Dancing, swimming, boxing, basketball, and tennis are all great cardio workouts, too. To make it a bit more enjoyable, grab a buddy and hit the floor, the pool, the arena, or the court.
 So cardio may be the quickest way to blast away calories, but when you do both, the effect is even better.And when you do start losing weight, you'll want to lose fat, not muscle. Aim to weight train a couple times a week.


While cardio can (and should) be done most days of the week, keep working with weights to 2 or 3. Your muscles need time to heal themselves.
 When you work 9 to 5 (or even longer), sometimes being asked to work out sounds like a joke. Cooking your own meal is a big endeavor after a long day; running for half an hour is just out of the question. So take little efforts all throughout the day instead -- the effect does add up over time.


Skip out on the elevator and park far away from the entrance at work or while shopping. Go out of your way to keep moving when at all possible. This goes double if you work at a desk all day -- your brain will feel invigorated with the movement, too.

 Pour seven drops of essential oil in an empty 16 ounce (473.17 ml) glass spray bottle. Then fill the spray bottle up until until about one inch (2.54 cm) from the top with warm water.Use either peppermint, tea tree, citrus, lavender or neem essential oil, as these oils are proven to repel spiders.
Try to use a glass spray bottle, as essential oils can sometimes react with plastic.;
, Add a small squirt of liquid dish soap into the spray bottle, then place the top on the bottle and shake so that the mixture is combined.Because oil and water don’t mix, dish soap is needed to break apart the oil molecules so that they can mix in with the water.
 Spray the essential oil spray on any entry points in your house, including around window frames, door cracks, and any crevices that you may notice in your home. Also spray any corners where spiders tend to congregate.If you are spraying furniture or carpets, keep in mind that the oil may leave a stain. Spot test an inconspicuous area of the upholstery or carpet by spraying and making sure the repellent doesn’t alter its color before using.
 Natural repellents need to be reapplied more often than chemical-based ones, so make sure that you reapply the spray once a week.

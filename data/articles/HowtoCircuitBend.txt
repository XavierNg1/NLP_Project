 Circuit bending often leads into more sophisticated electronics as your projects become more ambitious.;
, Use the right size screwdriver and be patient and gentle with a pesky screw (especially screws and security bits, or torx screws). Many toys are made so that the soft metal screws strip easily, rendering you unable to open your toy.
 If the side of the PCB with all the tiny traces, running between the silver solder IC is where you can easily see it (without unscrewing it, you have no hassles in this regard. If not, unscrew the board and flip it around.
,, Sooner or later (hopefully sooner), you will find a place where your clips make a connection that alters the sound. (this is true if your toy does not have the PCB flipped over, and you see the brown side, where the resistors and things are, you can try to short circuit certain connections going back and forth from the CPU to the sound chip, and vice versa to crash the CPU program, and/or destroy the ROM.) Again, this will be different, depending on how the toy was made

, So you've found an area on the circuit that alters the sound. Now it's time to delve further.

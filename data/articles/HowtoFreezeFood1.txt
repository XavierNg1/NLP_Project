 If the food is exposed to air in its container, plastic bag, or other packaging, it will cause the food to dry out and experience freezer burn.


Place your food in quality freezer bags or plastic containers; alternatively, wrap your food with freezer wrap or aluminum foil.
Squeeze any extra air out of the plastic bags and containers before sealing them.
Leave enough space for your food to expand in the bag or container if you are storing a liquid or a food that contains a lot of juice or gravy.
Be sure to label and date all frozen food.;
, This will prevent your food from retaining moisture during the freezing process if you place it into the freezer while it is still warm. Importantly, ensure that this food cools quickly; cool on the kitchen bench until the steam stops escaping. Then, place into the container and freeze.
 This will help you identify the foods after they have become frozen, and will also help you keep track of the dates on which they were originally placed in the freezer.


Place sticker labels on each container or use a permanent marker to label each plastic bag.
 The faster your food becomes frozen, the better it will retain its flavor and freshness upon defrosting it. This means avoiding freezing large amounts of food at a time; rather, split the food up.


Package your food in small portions so that it freezes faster, especially if you are freezing large dishes such as casseroles. This also means that it defrosts more quickly and it's easier to add packages together to make enough food than to undo a large package and leave waste.
Place your food in the freezer with space around each item. This will allow the cold air to circulate around your food efficiently and cause it to freeze at a fast pace.

 You may want to raise funds for your own project that is aimed at furthering the cause, or you may want to get involved in raising funds for an organization that is supporting a cause you and your classmates or friends believe in. If you want to raise general funds for a cause, the best option is to do so on behalf of an established non-governmental organization. Many organizations have fundraising campaigns that involve local volunteers and projects. Always contact an organization in advance: you must have their official permission to raise funds in their name.;
, Whether you are raising funds for an established organization or for a project of your own, through local events or by applying for a grant, remember the following guidelines:


The purpose for which you are fundraising must be absolutely clear.
Any money raised must be used for the stated purpose and no other.
You should keep careful accounts of any money you raise and what you spend it on, recording even the smallest amounts.
Any money raised must be kept safely, preferably in a bank account opened in the name of your group.
It may be a good idea to ask a responsible adult to 'audit' your accounts, so there can be no question of misuse of funds.
 There are many ways of raising funds, from simple collecting boxes and doing odd jobs to organizing sponsored walks and more elaborate events such as concerts and fairs. One of the most effective ways is fundraising on Facebook with help of your family and friends. Fundraising apps for Facebook reach networks of your friends and family by showcasing your online fundraising campaign in their news feeds. It's free to create a campaign, and it's worth of trying.

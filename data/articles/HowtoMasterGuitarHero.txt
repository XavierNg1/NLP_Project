 Try some songs like: Shout at the Devil, Surrender, or Woman. In career mode, do the encore as soon as possible.;
, Play the same songs over and over again and you will eventually get the guts to try the song on a harder level.
 On levels hard and expert, the orange button will come into use. Get used to the fact that there will be more orange buttons as the game goes on, and you will have to deal with it sooner or later.
 If you get frustrated, don't give up! It will take a while to get the orange and maybe blue buttons, but you'll get it!

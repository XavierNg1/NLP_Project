 Usually contests are a way for companies to gather valuable personal data and selling it on to other companies. The database is worth far more than the prize they are giving away.
 For most companies, this is also a way to gather a database filled with valuable survey data. This is usually true of online registrations as well, so only register when it is unavoidable.
 With the U.S. Postal Service, they are required to share your new address with companies if your move is listed as permanent. You can still get mail forwarding for 10 months if it is listed as a temporary move, giving you time to give your information to important parties.
 They are required to tell you if they plan to sell your information. You may be given the option of opting out of receiving mailings from the business you are applying to.
 Keep a designated list of the middle names you use so that you can contact the offending company to opt-out. This should not be done for bank or government applications.
 They may not be required to remove your name from the database, but some companies will tick a box that says you opted out.

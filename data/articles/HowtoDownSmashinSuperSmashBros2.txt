 Within Smash, a popular defensive option for both new and experienced players is to roll, which is done by shielding and pressing the control stick to the left or right, which will allow your character to move semi-invincibly. However, a roll can be punished with a down smash.
 If the opponent rolls towards your character, you can down smash in order to knock them out of the roll and create a tech chase situation.

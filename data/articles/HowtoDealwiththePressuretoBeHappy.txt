 This is key to getting rid of the pressure. This may be hard to do, because you may be feeling under pressure subconsciously. It could be people at school or work that seem happy, and you feel you really want to be that way.;
, You can't feel pressured by them, if you're not near them. This may be hard, if it is friends or loved ones, but if this is the case, then maybe you need to sit down and have a talk with them.
 This will help stop any anxiety, which means you are likely to stop feeling pressured. Also, if things are calm you will feel better about everything.
 If you seem happy, you won't feel as pressured about it! Keep your attitude good and moods up, but don't try so hard you start putting pressure on yourself!

, If you are busy with lots of things, it will take your mind off that old pressure.
 Your best self now, is all you can be today, accepting yourself will make it easier to keep pressure away. Being comfortable about yourself, in your daily life, helps with almost everything.
 Enjoy your work or school, think of life as opportunities, "not problems". Polish your hopes but don't expect much, soon. Relax.

Set up daily/weekly, plus short term (six-week), medium term (year) and long term goals (through school and college and/or job training), family and career plans. But, take it as it comes, and modify plans as necessary. Nothing is set in big headlines or sky-writing. Just be persistent but flexible and smile a little.

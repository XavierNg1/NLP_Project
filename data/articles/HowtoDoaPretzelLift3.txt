 Instead of lifting your whole leg, press your knee into the ground, and raise your ankle above your leg. Reach back and grab your ankle. Gently bring it forward until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings. This can help open up your hips, and it will help you slowly build up strength to do the lifts., If you feel a cramp or pinching in your back during this exercise, you can relieve the tension by shifting your alignment. Place your hands in front of you. The hand opposite to the worked leg should be placed slightly farther out to the side. Lean to the opposite side of the worked leg, and continue the workout. As you get stronger, you can begin to lift yourself back to center., If youâ€™re having difficulty raising or keeping your leg above the ground, lower yourself onto your elbows and forearms. You should still be leaning forward with your spine straight and your abs lifted., If you want to increase the difficulty of this move, you can press the leg back instead of up. While in pretzel form, lift the back leg, and instead of lifting it up, move it backwards slightly. You do not need to press back more than an inch or two.

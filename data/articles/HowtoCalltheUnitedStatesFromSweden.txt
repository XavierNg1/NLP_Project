The exit code (also known as an international access code) depends on where you're calling from. Zero-zero is the exit code for Sweden and most of Europe, but if you were placing a call from the United States or Canada you would dial 011 instead.
If you're using an international roaming or global cellular phone in Sweden, you still need to dial the Swedish exit code to make an international call.;

The USA country code also applies to other countries in the NANP, or North American Numbering Plan. These include Canada, Bermuda, Grenada, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago.



You must enter the area code. If you don't know the appropriate area code for the phone number you're trying to call, visit nanpa.com/area_code_maps/ac_map_static.html and click on the appropriate state to pull up a map of area-code boundaries in that state.
If the 3-digit prefix is 800, 888, 877 or 866, this signals that you're dialing a toll-free number.



All US phone numbers, including mobile numbers, consist of a 3-digit area code and a 7-digit phone number. If you have any extra digits left over, they may signify an extension you must dial after connecting to the first number. In a few cases, companies use their phone number to spell out a short message and add superfluous numbers at the end to complete that message.

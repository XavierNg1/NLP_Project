Pay attention in class, keep organized, study hard for tests, try your best, do your homework, participate in class, and don't procrastinate. Try to ace all your tests, and work hard!

, Geeky girls don't usually like to go out too much, and tend to like to stay home and study.This is completely fine, and isn't entirely unhealthy, as long as you go out every once in a while just for some fun and fresh air. But try to be an indoor person, and have fun indoors, too! Geeky girls aren't really sporty nor obsessed with nature, so enjoy the indoors, it's worth it., All geeky interests are indoors, so try to stay indoors, and practice them as often as possible.This includes video games, writing in a journal, reading, studying, and mastering computer science.

Cherish them forever and ever!

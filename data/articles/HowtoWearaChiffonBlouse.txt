 There are plenty of styles, from long to short sleeved, buttoned to zip-up. Make sure that your blouse fits you, because wearing a chiffon blouse that is too small can restrict the movement of your arms, and if it tears it can be hard to fix. Similarly, remember that the colour of a piece of clothing can completely alter the look of your outfit.;
, This means that they look best tucked into skinny jeans, pencil skirts or shorts. You can accessorise as much you like, but balance out your outfit. This means, don't wear a loose chiffon blouse with long sleeves and a billowing maxi skirt, because it will swamp your figure.
 When you buy a new one, or try a new one on, check to see how transparent it is. There are always slips or camisoles that can be worn underneath, but make sure that the colour of the cami doesn't show through the blouse, that the cami does not disturb the fall of the blouse and that it isn't uncomfortable. On a similar note, apply the same checks to your bra.
 If you wish to wear a printed chiffon blouse, go for plain trousers or pencil skirts. Wearing both the pieces with print will make the overall outfit very gaudy.
 An essential characteristic of a chiffon blouse is that it tends to be very, very thin. A smart cover-up option is a blazer or a leather jacket, depending on whether you are looking for an office ready look, or hoping to soften your biker chick outfit.

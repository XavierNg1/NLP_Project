 This dryer cycle will allow your clothes to cool while they are still moving, preventing wrinkles from forming. Clothes are most likely to wrinkle while they are warm, so cooling them when they can't form wrinkles is best.
 If you really want to keep your shirts from wrinkling after you fold them, starch and iron your shirts before folding.
 When you put away folded shirts, don't pack them in too tightly. This is more likely to wrinkle them.

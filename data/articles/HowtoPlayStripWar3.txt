 Because there are 52 cards in a deck, they can't always be perfectly divided among multiple players. Make sure that everyone is starting with the same number of cards, and put whatever spare cards to the side.If there are three players, everyone gets 17 cards and there is one spare. With four people, everyone gets 13 cards. With five people, everyone gets 10 and there are 2 spare cards.
 Everyone needs to be wearing the same amount of clothing in order to start off on an equal playing field. As a group, decide the order that clothes will come off.
 Whoever has the highest card gets to keep every single card on the table. Additionally, the person to win the first play gets to take the spare cards, if there are any. With more people playing, the more cards you can win. There is also a higher chance of having to go into a War tiebreaker with multiple players.
 Everyone goes to War, not just the players with matching cards. Each player places a card face down, and the following card face up. Whoever has the highest face-up card takes all the cards in play.The losers of the tiebreaker all have to remove one article of clothing, either predetermined or chosen by the winner. Everyone other than the one winner of the tiebreaker ends up stripping.
 Odds are that there will be multiple tiebreakers needed with several cards being played at once. However, you may want to play multiple games so that you can guarantee everyone gets sufficiently nude!


Players that run out of cards are removed from the game.

 Combine both ingredients in a large saucepan, making sure the water covers the barley completely.


You can also substitute broth for water and add salt (to taste) for enhanced flavor, but neither option is necessary.;
, Place the saucepan on the stove and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, cover the saucepan with a lid.


Note that the barley may produce a lot of foam and threaten to boil over the saucepan. Stirring the barley and watching it closely should help minimize the risk of accidental spills.
 Pearl barley may finish within 25 minutes, while hulled barley will usually require up to 45 minutes.If the water boils away prematurely, add more about 1/2 cup (125 ml) at a time.
 The barley should triple in volume and be soft, yet chewy.


You may need to test the barley every 5 minutes or so near the end of the cooking process until it reaches your desired consistency.
 Allow the barley to sit for 15 minutes without stirring, so that it can continue absorbing any excess water.


If there's still excess after letting the barley sit, you may need to drain the water away.
 Add the cooked barley to salad or soup, or toss with spices and oil for a delicious side dish.

 Inexpensive photo albums can often do your photos more harm than good. Many contain plastics that can damage your photos. Look for photo albums that use polypropylene or polyester (AKA Mylar). Polyethylene is not good for long-term storage, and vinyl of any type should be avoided like itâ€™s the plague. If the album uses paper, make sure the paper is both acid-free and lignin-free (it should be labeled as such). Department stores typically sell cheap albums. If you really want to protect your photos, go to a photography store.
 The PAT is a national standard that ensures none of the materials in the product will damage your photos. The label should clearly state that it passes the PAT.

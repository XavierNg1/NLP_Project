 Windows includes .zip support so that you can open and create .zip files without having to install any software.;
, You won't be able to run any file inside of the .zip file until you've moved it to another location. This will uncompress the file, allowing you to access it.
 This button is located at the top of the open .zip file's window. You will be prompted to choose a location for the extracted files. All of the files in the .zip file will be uncompressed and copied to the location that you set.


If you are using Windows XP, you'll need to click the "Extract all files" link in the left sidebar of the open .zip.
You can also quickly extract a .zip file by right-clicking on it and selecting "Extract All".
 The creator of the .zip file may have password-protected it. You'll need to enter the password before you can extract the files inside.

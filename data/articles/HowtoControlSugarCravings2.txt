 The low serotonin levels caused by stress can make us reach for sugar as a temporary serotonin-booster. Practice daily stress management through deep breathing, reflection, yoga, meditation, or other activities to help reduce stress-based sugar cravings.Even if you do not feel particularly stressed at a given time, still try to employ stress management techniques. The better control you have of your stress overall, the easier it will be to control when a craving strikes.

 You are trying to show the school who you really are, so try to use a natural tone when writing.Use the active voice as much as possible.
Don't be too casual. This is a professional academic paper, not creative writing.
Don't be too stilted. When you're finished writing, go through and change any words you've chosen that you wouldn't ordinarily use.
 When writing, bear in mind that many people will probably read your personal statement. Medical school admission decisions are usually determined by a board or committee made up of professors, school administrators, and local doctors. Imagine your essay as seen through their eyes., The person reading your personal statement will probably be reading dozens of others in the same day. Be sure yours stands out from the crowd and gets noticed.Imagine you are advertising yourself. List all your “selling points.”
Put the most impressive information at the beginning.
 Personal statements are best when you include concrete actions rather than abstract descriptions. Instead of describing your personal moral code, give an example of a specific incident when you acted on principle.Think of the “interest equation” when writing: personal experience + specific details = interesting., Resist the urge to show off the medical knowledge you have already acquired by using technical terms. Not everyone reading and judging your essay will be a medical professional., If you don't like to boast, or feel uncomfortable talking about yourself, you'll need to put aside those feelings. The whole point of the exercise is to make yourself look good.This can be tricky, but you need to find the right balance between confidence and humility. You don't want to come across as boastful or arrogant.
 Your statement needs to be an expression of who you are – how your mind works and what you believe in. Be as honest as you can in your statement, so you will expose your true character., Unless there is something on your permanent record that you feel requires an explanation, avoid making excuses in your essay. Play to your strengths, don't point out your inadequacies., Resist the urge to begin your essay with a quote from your favorite author or scientist – it will just sound pretentious. The admissions board wants to hear what you have to say, not what a famous person had to say., When writing your essay, avoid using overused phrases that sound trite. This comes across as lazy writing and poor use of language.Common clichés include: “a clean slate,” “a thirst for knowledge,” “go the extra mile,” “as luck would have it,” and “it goes without saying.” If you aren't sure if something is cliché, it's best to avoid it.

 The slicked-back look stays in place better when you start with damp hair. The hair will finish drying in a slicked position, helping it stay in place all day long. Shampoo your hair and towel it dry to begin.

, Use your fingers to apply a liberal amount of strong-hold pomade to your hair, focusing on the top and sides. Pomade is the classic product used to create this look. A strong-hold pomade is essential to keep your hair slicked back until you wash it out.









Pomade was classically oil-based. Oil-based pomade creates the classic sheen and hold that made the slicked look popular. However, oil is difficult to wash out, so you may want to look for a strong-hold pomade that does not list oil as a main ingredient.
Gel is a good alternative if your hair isn't too thick. Gel typically results in a dryer hold and may take on a slightly crunchy texture. This works best with finer, lighter hair types, since it may not be strong enough to hold heavier hair in place.
 Use a fine-toothed barber comb and slick your hair straight back from your forehead to the crown of your head. The classic slick does not include a part, so just run the comb straight back. Do this several times so that the top or your hair lies flat in straight pattern from front to back.
 Place the comb at your right temple and run it to the back of your head. Now do the same on the left side. The hair on the sides of your head should flow in a slicked pattern from front to back.
 In most cases, six or seven comb-throughs, or "slicks," should be enough to create this quick style. You want to style your hair in as few slicks as possible to keep the pomade evenly distributed in your hair. If you handle it too much, it may begin to look messy.

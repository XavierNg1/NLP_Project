 Pillbugs eat mostly decomposing vegetables in the wild and should have a similar diet in captivity to keep them healthy.


Pillbugs can safely be fed fish flakes, which you can purchase at a pet store.In addition to fish flakes, feed your pillbugs leftover bits of apples, lettuce, potatoes, and carrots. You can also bring leaf litter in from the wild and feed them to your pillbug.While you can feed pillbugs food that has been sitting out for a few days, do not offer them moldy food. This can make them sick., Pillbugs require a humid environment to survive.


Invest in a humidity thermometer to make sure your pillbugs environment is adequately moist. Pillbugs should not live in an environment of less than 75% humidity. They will not survive without proper humidity.Mist the container once a day with a spray bottle. Also, make sure to add water to the soil on a daily basis. You can also place a damp cotton ball or paper towel in the container. Just make sure your pill bugs don't eat them!

, Waste gases emitted by pillbugs can be strong enough to cause health problems, so soil should be replaced periodically. Make sure you remove all the pillbugs before changing the soil. If your pillbugs have reproduced, babies may be difficult to differentiate from soil. If this is the case, put a piece of wood in the container as babies are likely to congregate there.
 Most pillbugs can be handled easily, but you should do so with care.


Gently pick pillbugs up with your thumb and forefingers when you want to handle them. You can also scoop them up with a spoon.
Make sure not to drop your pillbugs while handling them, as this can cause them pain. They walk fairly fast and can sometimes fall by mistake.
Never handle pillbugs while they're shedding.

 This choice should be made based on the styling of your home, as well as your budget. The four common frame types are: wood, vinyl or metal clad wood, and all vinyl or all wood.


Wood Frames: If the exterior of your home features natural wood siding, a wood frame will complement your home nicely. Wood frames are generally more expensive, but they do offer a low heat transfer and can be very energy efficient. If you’re looking for low maintenance, however, they don’t exactly fit the bill. They must be properly primed and painted, as well as repainted every few years to maintain their appeal.
Vinyl/Metal Clad Window Frames: Many replacement window manufacturers offer a wood frame window with a metal or vinyl “wrapping” on the exterior of the window. As long as the “wrapping” is sealed, the window is relatively maintenance free. You can also choose a color that complements the exterior of your home, without having to repaint every few years.

Keep in mind that although the window unit is maintenance free, you will still have to either paint the exterior trim to match the window wrapping or replace the trim with a vinyl product like Azek.


Metal Window Frames: If you’re looking for low maintenance as well as low cost, a metal frame might be a good choice. Metal windows and siding are less stylish than they used to be, but that doesn't mean that you can't make them look good in your home.
Vinyl Frames: Vinyl replacement windows are extremely popular because they are easy to install, cost effective, and energy efficient.

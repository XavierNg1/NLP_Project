 Meanwhile, prepare an oven-safe grill pan by coating it with nonstick cooking spray.


If you do not have an oven-safe grill pan, you can create your own substitute by laying an oven-safe wire rack inside a shallow baking sheet. The rack should be flat and secure inside the baking sheet.
 Rinse the sweet potatoes under cool, running water, scrubbing the skins with a vegetable brush as needed to remove any visible dirt.


Alternatively, you can peel the sweet potatoes using a vegetable peeler. You should still rinse the peeled sweet potatoes after removing the skin, but you do not need to scrub them clean with a brush.
 Using a sharp knife, cut the sweet potatoes into lengthwise wedges or crosswise coins.


If cutting the sweet potatoes into coins, make sure that each slice is about 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) thick.
If cutting the sweet potatoes into wedges, cut at least eight wedges. Slice each on in half lengthwise. Halve each half to create quarters, and halve each quarter to create eighths.
 Arrange the sweet potato wedges in an even, single layer over your prepared grill pan or wire rack.


Each wedge should come into direct contact with the grates of the pan. Keeping the wedges in a single layer should ensure even cooking, and keeping the wedges on the grates should better mimic the taste and texture of sweet potatoes prepared on the grill.
 For basic seasoning, brush the olive oil evenly over all of the prepared wedges. Sprinkle the wedges with generous amounts of salt and pepper.
 Place the prepared wedges in the preheated oven and “grill” them for 30 minutes, or until they become tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.


Turn or flip the wedges over halfway through the cooking time to ensure even browning and even marking.
 Remove the finished sweet potatoes from the oven. Brush them with additional butter, if desired, and enjoy them while they’re still hot.

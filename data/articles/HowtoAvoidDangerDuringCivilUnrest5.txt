 Because streets may be gridlocked, crowded, and potentially violent, avoid public transportation, especially bus and train stations. These places may become hopelessly – and dangerously – crowded if there is even a threat of impending civil unrest. Airports can also become swamped, potentially dangerous places, so it's best to call the airport or your Embassy in advance to check on the situation there.
 Survival experts agree that if you do need to leave your home, do so quietly. Don’t attract attention to yourself, keep your head down, be quiet, and don’t get involved in the unrest. You don’t want to put yourself in unnecessary danger or delay your evacuation., If you live in a weather-incident prone area, your local government may have pre-established evacuation routes. These may be a good option for you, but more than likely they will be at a standstill with everyone trying to leave en masse. It’s a good idea to ask if the state or county has any secondary evacuation routes mapped out and to keep those in mind as well., Whether the civil unrest incident was brief or lasted for weeks, your life will be disrupted to some degree. After the situation is controlled, relief organizations may come into the area to offer food, water, and medical treatment. While it’s still safest to stay home, seek assistance from hospitals and relief organizations if you need it, only when it’s safe to do so.

 You will need to buy a latex or polymer patching compound from a hardware store. Prime any large areas of patching once they are dry.
 Consult your carpeting installers to ensure that you choose a primer that is compatible with the adhesive compound they plan to use.
 Apply a solution of tri-sodium phosphate to ensure a completely clean surface. Rinse well and open windows so the surface dries completely.

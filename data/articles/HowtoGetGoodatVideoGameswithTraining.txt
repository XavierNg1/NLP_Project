 Playing a game for hours on end leads to problems, such as addiction and obsession. Play for an hour or two without any distractions to build up knowledge of the game. If you are playing at night, be sure that parents don't find out and you have the volume on low.;
, Games are dull and boring if it's not what you like to play, too challenging, or too confusing. Experiment by borrowing games from friends or renting games from video stores. If you grow into liking it, convince a parent to buy it for you.
 Avoid using cheats, if possible. Cheats can ruin the fun of the game, especially if you're just starting it. Spend a few days or so on easy levels of the game so that you can familiarize yourself with it.
 Get your friends to help you if you're stuck on something or if you want to play multi-player.
 Often, mastering the the controls to a game will help you do better than if you hadn't.

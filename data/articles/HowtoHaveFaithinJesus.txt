 At times God might do things that strengthen your Faith out of his Mercy. If you really want to see the glory of God's Faith, you must get to know God personally and you must be willing to follow him anywhere. Pray and grow with God and over time your Faith will grow as you have more and more experiences with Jesus Christ.;
, The Bible clearly says in John 14:13, "And I will do whatever you ask in my name , so that Son may bring glory to the Father." If you come to God and ask him with all your heart for Faith, He will never reject you.
 But as hard as it is, we must have patience and wait for Gods time to bless us. Never give up and never be discouraged. While we wait we must always keep in prayer with the Lord and we must Focus on the Lord at all times. While you wait, believe that God will give you the Faith you asked for. You might start noticing that is what Faith is! Believing.

, Pick a ginger root that has green nubs or buds. Leave potatoes in a dark place until they sprout. Wait until yam sprouts, or take a healthy yam.
 When the ginger buds have turned a dark, healthy shade of green, cut them from the root. Cut the sweet potatoes pieces with sprouts into chunks. Take the yam and cut off the half that has the most buds/sprouts. Put in toothpicks at right angles so the vegetable suspends over water (half in water).
 Plant the ginger in soil but make sure that half the top part of ginger is visible. Plant the yam in soil up to the sprout but not covering any of them.
 Ginger is ready to harvest when the plant is starting to wilt and die. After harvesting, let the ginger dry. Yams and sweet potatoes can all be harvested when the plants wilts, turns yellow, and dies.

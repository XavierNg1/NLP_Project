 Measure 2 1/2 cups (350 g) of all-purpose flour into a mixing bowl. Add 2 3/4 teaspoons of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of salt. Whisk the ingredients for about 30 seconds, so the baking powder is evenly distributed., Pour in 1 tablespoon of vegetable, olive, or canola oil and 3/4 cup (180 ml) of water. Stir the pizza dough until it forms into a ball. You may need 1/4 cup (60 ml) more water, if your flour absorbs a lot of the water.Ensure that you add the extra water a tablespoon or two at a time. Avoid adding so much water that the dough becomes sticky.
 Sprinkle a little flour on your work surface and scoop the pizza dough onto it. Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes, so the dough becomes smooth and elastic.You can knead the dough however you like. The important thing is that the dough is stretched and folded repeatedly. This will develop the gluten in the flour.
 You can use a rolling pin to roll the pizza out to any shape you like, or you can place it into your pizza pan and stretch the dough to fit the pan. Keep in mind that the pizza crust will be thick if you make one pizza out of this dough.If you want to make two thin-crust pizzas, just divide the dough in half and roll them until they're as thin as you'd like.
 Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F (200 C). Spread the dough with sauce, pesto, or oil. Sprinkle your choice of pizza toppings across the top and bake the pizza for 15 to 25 minutes.If you're making two thin crust pizzas, they may only need 10 to 15 minutes.

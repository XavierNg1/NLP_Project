 If stains form on your dentures, you can purchase a denture cleanser from a drugstore or supermarket. These cleansers are available in cream, gel, and liquid formulas, and they work for full and partial dentures.


Look for a product approved by the American Dental Association, as these cleansers are proven to be safe and effective.
 In general, gels and creams are brushed onto the dentures, then rinsed; for liquids, youâ€™ll often drop a tablet into water or another solution, which will fizz and remove stains.
 Whatever product you choose, be sure to rinse your dentures with plain tap water before patting them dry and putting them back in your mouth.

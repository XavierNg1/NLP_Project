 A bruise is formed when a fall or blow causes blood vessels to break, causing blood flow to move to the skin's surface. When you first notice a bruise, apply ice right away. Ice can help heal a bruise fast by constricting underlying blood vessels.


An ice pack, a bag of frozen vegetables, or ice in a plastic bag can serve as a cold compress. Remember, do not place an ice pack directly on the skin. Always wrap an ice pack in a cloth or towel.Every hour, apply the cold compress for at least 20 minutes. Do this for the first 48 hours you notice a bruise.;
, After 48 hours, transition from a cold compress to a warm one. This can increase blood flow to the area, allowing the skin to heal quicker. You can make a warm compress by running warm water over a wash cloth. Apply the compress to the bruise for 10 minutes two to three times a day., Over-the-counter pain medications might help with the healing of a bruise. Most over-the-counter pain meds reduce swelling, which can make the bruise less noticeable.


Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) are your best options for a bruise. Take in the recommended dose at the recommended intervals.Before taking any over the counter meds, talk to your doctor or a pharmacist to make sure they won't interact with any existing medication you're taking., Elevate the bruise as much as possible during the first 24 hours. This is especially important if you have a large bruise on an area like your leg or foot. Try to get some rest as well, avoiding exerting the body part where the bruise occurred.

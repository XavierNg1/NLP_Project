 If you're working out hard on a regular basis, you deserve a reward from time to time. That doesn't mean you can't try to sneak some extra protein into your cookies, brownies, or pancakes.Replace cocoa powder in baked goods with chocolate-flavored protein powder. A scoop of protein powder is equal to about 1/4 cup of cocoa powder. If you want a really rich chocolate taste, add about 1/2 of the recommended amount of cocoa powder as well as a scoop of chocolate-flavored protein mix.
If the recipe does not include cocoa powder, you can typically add a scoop of protein powder without affecting the taste. It may still be a good idea to use half a scoop on a small batch when trying it for the first time.
Try adding unflavored protein powder to your baked goods to maintain the flavors that you like while still getting your protein boost., Some people love protein icing, and some people hate it. It doesn't hurt to give it a try, though! Stir protein powder into yogurt or a very small amount of water or milk to create a thick "icing."When you spread it onto muffins or other baked goods, you get the benefit of the protein while masking its taste with your tasty treat!

, Thick foods like oatmeal, pudding, yogurt, or applesauce can mask the taste of protein powder well. They moisten and dissolve the powder on their own, so you don't have to pull out your blender.Just make sure to stir thoroughly to make sure the powder dissolves all the way., Blend one scoop of flavored protein powder, one scoop of vanilla ice cream, and one spoonful peanut butter in your blender. Pour the mixture into some type of mold â€” an ice cube tray will work fine if you don't have anything fancy on hand. Freeze the mixture for a few hours to allow it to set and harden.This works best with chocolate-flavored protein powder, but strong flavors like cinnamon can work as well.

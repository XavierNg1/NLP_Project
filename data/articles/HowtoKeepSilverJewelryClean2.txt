 Any toothpaste can work, but it is recommended to use toothpaste used for tartar control. The extra hydrated silica in those brands help remove tarnish more easily., A cotton cloth or paper towel can also be used to help massage toothpaste onto silver jewelry surfaces. The tarnish should come off instantly., Use warm water to get rid of the toothpaste. If you notice that some tarnish still remains, squeeze more toothpaste onto the silver and give it another rinse. Once it is cleaned to your liking, pat the piece dry.

Potatoes can start to discolor once peeled so keep them in water until you've prepared as many potatoes as you need. Dry the chopped potatoes on a clean tea towel or kitchen paper.;
, Put the potatoes in the oil, and cook until they are well done. Add the garlic to cook about halfway through cooking the potatoes.


You could also bake them in the oven if preferred. Bake at around 350ºF/180ºC for 10 minutes or so.
Be aware the potatoes may take some time to cook if they have been cut too thickly. Keep the cuts thin.
The garlic may burn before the potatoes cook, so don't add it too early.
 Cut it into 4 evenly sized squares.

., Drain off the oil, if needed., Brush beaten egg around the edges for the best sealant. Fold the pastry diagonally to form pockets. The egg will make the pastry stick together.
 Set the oven to 350ºF/180ºC and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden brown. The pastry may not color unless you have egg washed across it.


Be aware that the potatoes may overcook if left in too long.
 Let the pockets cool, then serve on a plate. Enjoy your cool potato and pastry unseasoned dish.

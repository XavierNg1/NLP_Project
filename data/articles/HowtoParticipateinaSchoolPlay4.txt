5-15 minutes is a good rule of thumb for rehearsals, but you are usually required to arrive over 1 hour early for performances.
Ask questions if you need to.



If you make a mistake, don't show it.
Do not correct other people! That is disrespectful to them and the directors!
If you are cut from the show or the scene, do not beg or whine. Say "I respect your decision." Or nod and walk away.



Help advertise! Don't make your own flyers, but tell as many people as possible about your show.
Have fun. This is not a chore!
Write notes on how it went and what you could do better next time.

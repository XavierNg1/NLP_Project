 Draw a simple spine with a curved line.;
, This will help you get the idea of what a cat's body looks like., Add things like underbelly, fur detail, paws, toes, claws, ears, muscle, etc.
 Draw with a lighter pencil (or computer brush size) for fur.
 Determine where the sun is. begin to add shading/shadows where the sun can't reach.
 If you are using a computer, do it on a new layer. If you are using paper, do it the way you normally do.
 If your cat is tortoiseshell, or tabby, add stripes or patches or spots. Once you have done this, on a new layer (or the same bit of paper) begin to use a lighter version of the colour you used on the fur, like so.
 Practice is key.

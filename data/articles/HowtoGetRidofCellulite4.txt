 This treatment involves injecting a formula of vitamins and minerals into the skin to make it look more even. The solution breaks down the fat deposits just below the skin's surface.
 These use lasers, massage rollers and radio frequency energy to break down the fat deposits. They also stimulate the production of collagen in your skin, which leads to a tighter, more toned appearance.
 These may help you lose weight, but they can actually increase the appearance of cellulite by making the tissue under the skin more uneven.

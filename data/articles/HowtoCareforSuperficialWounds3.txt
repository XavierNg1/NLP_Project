 Use warm water and soap and rinse at least for 30 seconds to ensure your hands are clean.Also, dry your hands well before touching the affected area to reduce the risk of infection.
 If washing does not remove all debris, use tweezers cleaned with alcohol to remove the particles. Also, remove the object that caused the puncture if still present.If the object that caused the puncture is still inside your skin and cannot be removed completely, or if you cannot remove the object without causing further damage, seek medical attention.
 If bleeding occurs, apply pressure to stop it. You can use a clean cloth to press the injury or, if available, an ice pack wrapped in a towel.Depending on the type and size of the injury, the puncture might not be bleeding at all., Do this ONLY for superficial wounds. If the wound is large, open and affects deep tissues, do not apply any topical medication and seek medical attention.
 This will help keep the wound clean and reduces the risk of infection and other complications.Change the bandage a few times a day and every time it gets wet or dirty.
Consult your doctor whether you should receive a tetanus booster shot within 48 hours. This is usually recommended if it's been more than 5 years since you've had a tetanus shot. Even minor puncture wounds can lead to infection.
 If the wound is not healing or you notice excessive pain, warmth, redness and/or drainage, seek medical attention immediately.

 Dampen a paper towel with a bit of cooking oil. Wipe the point of contact between the top and bottom bowls. Carefully pull or twist the stuck cooking bowls apart.You could use olive oil, vegetable oil, or any other cooking oil to unstick the cooking bowls.
 If you don’t have any liquid cooking oil on hand, or if you’ve found that the oil is ineffective, you could use an oil-based spray. Just spray the point of contact between the two bowls with a light coating of cooking spray.Carefully pull or twist the cooking bowls apart.
 Whether you’ve used an oil spray or liquid cooking oil, sometimes the oil won’t be effective immediately. If, after pulling or twisting the bowls apart, they are still stuck, wait about 20-30 seconds. This will give the oil time to work its way between the two cooking bowls that are stuck together.If necessary, apply or spray another coat of cooking oil to loosen them.

 Music paper has five lines and four spaces in between. If you don't have any music paper, just draw five evenly spaced horizontal lines with a ruler. Make sure to draw the lines neat if you don't have music paper,so it comes out right

, Make sure it's intersecting all of the lines from the music paper. It should be a little longer, so that it hangs off both ends.
 Draw a semi-circle at the top of the vertical line that ends at the second horizontal line down. Now it should look like a long and skinny "P".
 This new line should curve around the other side of the vertical line and intersect it again at the last horizontal line.
 You're essentially making a semi-circle that's slightly smaller than the previous one. Make it so that the top goes a little over the third horizontal line.
 The spiral should end on the second (from the bottom) horizontal line, which indicates the note "G".
 Go to the end of the first line you drew, and draw a little line going off of it as shown.

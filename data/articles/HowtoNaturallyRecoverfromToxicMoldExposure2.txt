The recommended dosage of glutathione supplements is 250 mg once per day.
 Fungi, which include molds and yeasts, require the presence of sugar for survival. Therefore, it will be beneficial for you to remove or significantly cut down on your intake of sugar.


For quite some time now, low-sugar diets have been popularized in an effort to fight candida infection. It is a sensible idea to cut of the food supply for the fungi in order to put an end to fungal yeast or mold infections and regain health.
If you have diabetes, it's important to ensure that your blood sugar levels are under control, otherwise it could make the mold exposure much harder to get rid off.

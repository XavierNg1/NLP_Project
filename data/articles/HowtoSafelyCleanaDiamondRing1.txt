 Squirt a little dish soap into a bowl. Fill the bowl with warm water. Swish it around a bit to produce some suds.


Use a gentle dish soap, preferably one made with natural ingredients, to avoid harming your ring with chemicals.
Gentle hand soap, shampoo, or body wash may also be used. Be sure not to use a soap that contains "moisturizers," though - it might leave a film on your ring.;
, Let the soapy water soak into the ring. It will penetrate and loosen the dirt, dust and grime that has built up there.
 If you can still see dirt buildup, you'll need to clean it further. Otherwise, you can rinse your ring in clean water.
 Make sure you use a soft-bristled brush, rather than medium or hard-bristled, so that your ring doesn't get scratched. Scrub lightly, poking the bristles into the hard-to-reach crevices.









You can use a toothpick to poke dirt out of the crevices if necessary.
, Place your ring on a paper towel or clean cloth and let it completely dry.

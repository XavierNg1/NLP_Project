, Discard any that are dry-rotted and/or cracked. Replace any wall fittings.,, If above-ground pool, reattach hoses removed at closing.
, Do not over-tighten!

, powder tight filter, make sure clamp band is tight and properly positioned. (It was probably removed in the fall to have the filter grids pulled out and cleaned with a hose, so make sure it was re-installed correctly).
,, Fill pump basket with water from pool or hose.
 Look for leaks out of pump. Double check that all valves and pressure relief orifices are open.
, Multiport valves should be on the filter position. (Or you can start the pump with the valve in the Drain to Waste position, and when water begins to run out the waste line, shut off the pump. Place valve into the Recirculate position and run pump until water flows into the pool. Shut off pump, switch the valve to the Filter position to complete the process.)

, Turn off if pressure rises above normal range; usually above 30 psi.
 If no pressure builds up at all, and pump is not pumping, shut off power after 1 minute.
 If pump still won't prime up, try closing main drain valve, if present, and starting off the skimmer alone. If pump still won't catch prime after 5 or so attempts, check incoming pipes for air leaks.
 Add 1 lb of DE powder per 5 sq. ft of filter area into the skimmer (only if you have a DE filter, of course). Do this quickly, within 2 minutes of starting filter. If you have a cartridge filter replace cartridge element every 2 years. Sand filters should have their sand changed every 5 years.
 Check for leaks around pump and filter; repair as needed. Note start-up pressure on filter gauge. When psi is 10 lbs above this number, backwash the filter. Empty pump basket also at this time, or earlier if you notice a drop in filter pressure. If you have a heater, follow pilot lighting and test firing instructions, usually printed on back of front heater door. Operate to test and adjust all other equipment.

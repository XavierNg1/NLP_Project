 A paper person can be made from many types of paper, it just depends on what you plan on doing with the paper person and how much "handling" the paper person will get.


Thin, strong card is best if the paper person is to be played with.
If using on a collage or other craft, the paper can be of any kind, matched to the craft's requirements.
Old wrapping paper can be turned into paper people; the patterns can make the person look very interesting.;
, Draw a very simple outline of a person, male or female. You don't need details on this drawing, just the shape, as you'll be cutting around this.


If you're having trouble getting the shape right, print off a basic picture of a human being and trace around it. Or, use a gingerbread man/woman cutter and trace around that, for a quirky person.
The size of the paper person is up to your needs. It might be a miniature person for playing with toy cars, or it might be a lifelike size, for pinning on the wall for a party decoration or a poster for science class.
 You now have a paper person.
 This step is optional and dependent on your end use of the paper person. However, some standard details to add include:


Facial features
Hair
Clothing
Shoes
Adornments, such as a watch, jewelry, headband, etc.
 If strong enough, the paper person can be used for play. If he or she busts, you can just make a new one.

 If other players are abusing you or someone else, report them immediately. Click on their name, and then click Report Player. Choose the appropriate reason, and an administrator will look into the report as soon as possible. Abuse or cyberbullying is something you need to take seriously, as it can really upset and harm people. If and only if you've already done this, proceed with the steps below.;
, Look at your current house. Study the places and furniture items that are there. Are there any bamboo screens, many of them, so many they cover your animal? Is there something that covers your name tag? Once you've found this, prepare to take action.
 If you can't wait, then say to them, "I don't like the way you're treating me. Please stop or I'm leaving', and THEN wait. Once they are gone, get from inside to out. If they hired someone to watch you while they are gone, you may need to distract whoever is watching you. Once this is done, or if they are too busy to notice you, sneak into furniture and avoid talking.
 Do it quickly before they come back. If you do not know the babysitter, continue to stay hidden. If you know the babysitter will track you down back to your parents, delete them as well. If they're on your side, keep them as friends and they will help you escape. If you have brothers/sisters that don't like the abusers, ask them if they want to join you.
 There you can delete animals they know you as, create new animals, change your appearance, pretty much you need to start over. But remain children.
 There is a chance your ex parents have already come home, found you gone, and are now going undercover to find you.
 When you are adopted, tell them you came from an abusive family and you want to start over. If they want to help protect you, ask them not to friend the ex parents or friends of them. You may also want your parents/mom/dad to keep their dens locked.
 Just don't keep your guard down, it may happen again!

 Distal radial fractures are very common in children, often occurring due to a fall or sports injury. Certain classifications (usually extra-articular) are specific to children, including the Torus fracture – a mild bulging of the cortex at the distal end of the radius. The cortex is the outer, hard part of the bone. In Torus fractures, there is no displacement because the fracture is incomplete. It heals rapidly with cast immobilization.
 Greenstick fractures are also incomplete; they occur when the bone is bent suddenly by a fall on an outstretched hand or a direct perpendicular blow. The convex side of the bone is broken, but the concave surface remains intact.
 Epiphyseal fractures occur at the growth plate of the radius and are subdivided into five types based on the location of the fracture line. Also known as a “Salter-Harris fracture,” an epiphyseal fracture sometimes involves premature fusion of the growth plate, leading to shortening of the limb.

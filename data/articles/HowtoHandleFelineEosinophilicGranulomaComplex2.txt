 It is important to keep fleas and other parasites under control when treating feline eosinophilic granuloma. Bites from parasites can cause the immune system of a cat with feline eosinophilic granuloma to overreact and that can begin an outbreak.If you are already giving your cat parasitic treatment on a regular basis, make sure that it is working well for your cat by checking for parasites and then continue treatment as normal.
 If you, or your veterinarian, think that the lesions could be related to a food allergy, you may want to start an elimination diet or start feeding your cat a hypoallergenic diet. Finding the source of the allergic reaction that prompts the lesions, and then keeping it out of your cat's diet, can go a long way toward clearing up the condition.An elimination diet requires that you transition your cat onto a diet that does not contain likely allergens. Then, once your cat's symptoms decrease, you start introducing possible allergens back into the cat's diet, in order to figure out what exactly was causing the lesions. These diets typically consist of novel proteins, such as kangaroo and duck, as well as a carbohydrate source.
A hypoallergenic diet is a type of cat food that doesn't contain any ingredients that are likely to cause an allergic reaction in cats., While symptoms of feline eosinophilic granuloma can be treated, it can be difficult to eliminate all flareups. In many cases, your cat will need treatment on and off for the rest of its life.If your cat's lesions return after a long period without flare ups, you should have it seen by a veterinarian. This will allow the veterinarian to make sure that your cat doesn't have any new underlying conditions that are causing the flare up.

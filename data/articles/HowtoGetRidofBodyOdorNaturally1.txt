 Since bacteria reacting with sweat produced by your sweat glands causes body odor, it is important to bathe or shower regularly. Use a gentle, plant-oil based soap and lather up. The greater the amount of lather and the longer you lather up, the more effective you are likely to be in removing bacteria from your skin.


Not all soap is antibacterial, nor do you necessarily need antibacterial soap. Try using peppermint castile soap when you shower. Peppermint oil is mildly antiseptic and can help fight body odor.
Although soap-and-water showers are best, rinsing the skin with water is better than nothing. Scrubbing with sand or even just a washcloth helps dislodge bacteria and oils is even more effective. This can be an issue in situations like camping.;
, This is especially important in those areas that are prone to body odor: the groin, armpits, and around the nipples. Also ensure that any areas of skin folds (under the breasts, in the groin, at the abdomen) are completely dry.


Avoid using cornstarch as a dusting powder. Many physicians believe that cornstarch can be used as “fungi food." Instead, use unscented talcum powder.
 For instance, shaving your armpits may be helpful in reducing odor. Also, clean the inside of your shoes on a regular basis, as these can be a great breeding ground for bacteria.
 Wear natural-fiber clothing like cotton, silk or wool. If you exercise and sweat, using synthetic materials that “wick” away moisture may be useful, but change back into the natural fibers after you shower away the sweat.


Cotton clothes allow the skin to breathe, reducing the amount of sweat. Therefore, wearing cotton clothes keeps the skin healthy, dry and odor-free.
 Closed footwear will lead to offensive odor from the feet if you sweat a lot, as there is lack of aeration. This is especially true if shoes are made of non-breathable materials. Aim to wear sandals, flip-flops or more breathable shoes as much as possible.

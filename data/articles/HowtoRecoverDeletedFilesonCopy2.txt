 All Windows computers have Recycle Bins. It’s usually located right on your desktop. Double-click on it to open.


This method will only work if the files were deleted from the same computer, and not anywhere else.
 Select all the files you’d like to restore by clicking on them. Use the normal Windows operations for multiple selections. The files you’ve selected will be highlighted.
 From the header menu, click on the “Restore the selected items” button. The files you’ve just selected will be restored to their previous locations.


You can also use “cut and paste” to move the files from the Recycle Bin to your Copy local folder.

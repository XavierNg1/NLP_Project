 Suck in a mouthful of air, close your mouth, and swallow. This is one of the only methods successfully used by a research team, who believe that hiccups might be a reaction to dislodge large pieces of food from the esophagus.You could simulate this by chewing and swallowing a moderately large mouthful of bread. Trying this with other foods, especially large amounts, is not recommended, due to the risk of choking.
Trying this too many times is likely to lead to an unpleasant, bloated sensation.
 Some people who burp on command repeatedly will induce a hiccuping fit.The same effect can be achieved by sucking in air rapidly to the back of your throat. Avoid overstimulating your glottis, or the flap at the back of your throat, by closing and reopening it rapidly.This is the same motion that occurs when you hiccup, so stimulating it intentionally may trigger hiccups.


Your glottis is active when you say "uh oh."Be aware of straining it from burping or screaming as a form of singing. Understanding where your glottis is and when it is stimulated will reduce your chances of straining it.
 Sudden temperature changes may stimulate certain nerves that can trigger a hiccuping session.It is the same technique mentioned earlier about eating or drinking foods that contrast in temperature.


Temperature change can also cause hives or swollen skin.
 Nervousness and excitement are likely emotions that will trigger hiccups.This is probably the least reliable method since most people hiccup only occasionally despite daily mood shifts. Still, if there is a movie, video game, sport, or other activity that makes you excited, scared, or nervous, be aware that it may induce the hiccups.

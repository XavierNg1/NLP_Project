 Safe Mode is most commonly used to troubleshoot issues with your device caused by third-party app installations. If you experiencing problems (like crashes, or rapid battery drain), Safe Mode can help you isolate which app is causing the bad behavior.


If problems persist while in Safe Mode, this means that there is a problem with the core software or hardware of your device, and third party apps are not to blame.;
, Press and hold the Power button and choose “Power Off” from the menu that appears.
 Once the device has completely powered off, you must start it again normally. Once the “Samsung” logo appears on the screen, release the power button and proceed to the next step.
 Continue holding the button until the device has finished booting.


Older models, like the Samsung Galaxy S3 or earlier will use the “Menu” button to the left of the middle “Home” button instead.
 The text “Safe Mode” will appear in the lower left corner of the screen. You can now safely troubleshoot your device and remove third party apps.


This can be useful if you think you have been infected with malware or have an app that is consistently crashing or causing performance issues.

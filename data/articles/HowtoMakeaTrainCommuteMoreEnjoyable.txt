 A fully charged computer will keep you preoccupied for hours as long as it's charged. Bring movies with you and watch an hour and a half pass by in no time.;
, The calming white noise of a train is enough to put anyone to sleep! Just make sure you set an alarm if your stop is less than an hour away!

, Listening to music is a great way to pass the time! It blocks out the noise of that crying baby two seats ahead and that annoying girl on her cell phone!

, Reading is a great way to help the train ride go by a little bit faster. Getting lost in a good story could pass hours or more! E-readers are awesome too!

, A lot of cell phones now have apps for everything. Games, social networking, news, even magazines! Texting your friends or family is sure to make the ride more enjoyable. Just don't be the annoying girl telling her life story over the phone. No one wants to listen to that.
 Listening to other peoples conversations is always fun. Just don't get caught!

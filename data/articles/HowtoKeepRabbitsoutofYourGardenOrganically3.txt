 Any mesh fencing with 1" (2.5 cm) holes or smaller should keep rabbits out of the garden. Place this around tree trunks or flowerbeds, or around the entire garden. Follow these guidelines to make sure the rabbits can't jump over or dig under:Bury the fence 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) deep. Not all rabbit species burrow, but better safe than sorry.
Bend the base of the fence. Bending the buried end of the fence 90º outward makes burrowing much more difficult.
Leave 2 feet (0.6 m) above the surface, or 3 ft (0.9 m) if you live near jackrabbits.
 Chicken wire will last longer if you bring it inside before the first frost. If you have winter plants that need to be protected, keep an eye on snowfall. Rabbits may be able to jump over the fence when snow is high. Clear the snow away from the fence, or invest in more chicken wire.
 Even live traps can often cause injury to rabbits, and may cause health and legal problems as well.Due to rabbit-borne diseases, it may be illegal to handle or release wild rabbits in your area. Talk to your local extension office, agriculture office, or center of local government before using traps.
 Traps are usually ineffective for jackrabbits. For cottontails (the most common small rabbit species), you'll need a trap with a 7 inch (18 cm) door. Bait the trap with cabbage, dried fruit, or flowers.


Traps work best in winter or early spring, when food is scarce.
If you're using lethal traps to reduce rabbit population, hunting is usually a more effective solution. Check local laws to find out if rabbits are a game species in your area.

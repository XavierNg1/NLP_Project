 If your oven has a light, turn it on so you can keep a close eye on your bananas.
 Don't overcrowd them, three or four bananas to a baking sheet is usually enough. Note that this method will not work for completely green bananas, they will need to be almost ripe (yellow in color) for best results.
 How long you need to leave the bananas in the oven will depend on what you intend to use them for.
 If you leave the bananas in the oven for an hour, the skins will turn completely black and the fruit will be perfect for using in smoothies and baking recipes, such as banana bread.
 If you leave the bananas in the oven just long enough for the skins to turn a darker yellow, without any dark spots forming, you will be able to eat them on their own. This should take about 20 minutes, but make sure to watch them closely in oven so you can take them out at exactly the right time.









Once you have removed the bananas from the oven, place them in the refrigerator to cool down and halt the ripening process. Eat once completely cool.

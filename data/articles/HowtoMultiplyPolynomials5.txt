 Each has two three-term polynomials with either a plus sign or a minus sign between terms.


A polynomial problem involving monomial and two binomials will look something like: (ax^2 + bx + c) * (dy^2 + ey + f)

Example: (2x^2 + 3x + 4)(5y^2 + 6y + 7)
Note that the same practices used to multiply two three-term polynomials should also be applied to polynomials with four or more terms.



The second polynomial refers to the (dy^2 + ey + f) portion of the equation.
Example: (5y^2 + 6y + 7)

, Each piece of the first polynomial should be broken up and distributed to the second polynomial as a whole.


At this point, the equation is something along the lines of: (ax^2)(dy^2 + ey + f) + (bx)(dy^2 + ey + f) + (c)(dy^2 + ey + f)

Example: (2x^2)(5y^2 + 6y + 7) + (3x)(5y^2 + 6y + 7) + (4)(5y^2 + 6y + 7)

, Distribute each newly single-term polynomial over all of the terms in the remaining three-term polynomial.


Essentially, the equation at this point is something along the lines of: (ax^2)(dy^2) + (ax^2)(ey) + (ax^2)(f) + (bx)(dy^2) + (bx)(ey) + (bx)(f) + (c)(dy^2) + (c)(ey) + (c)(f)

Example: (2x^2)(5y^2) + (2x^2)(6y) + (2x^2)(7) + (3x)(5y^2) + (3x)(6y) + (3x)(7) + (4)(5y^2) + (4)(6y) + (4)(7)

, The constants refer to the numerical digits in the problem. These are multiplied as they usually would be according to the standard times table.


In other words, during this part of the problem, you are multiplying a, b, c, d, e and f portions.
Example: 10(x^2)(y^2) + 12(x^2)(y) + 14(x^2) + 15(x)(y^2) + 18(x)(y) + 21(x) + 20(y^2) + 24(y) + 28

, The variables refer to the letters in the equation. When you multiply these variables, different variables will simply be combined together. When you multiply a variable by a like variable, though, you raise that variable by another power.


In other words, you are multiplying the the x and y portions of the equation.
Example: 10x^2y^2 + 12x^2y + 14x^2 + 15xy^2 + 18xy + 21x + 20y^2 + 24y + 28

, This type of problem is complex enough to potentially produce like terms, meaning two or more end terms that share the same ending variable. If this happens, you should add or subtract the like terms as needed to determine your final answer. If not, no additional addition or subtraction is needed.


Example: 10x^2y^2 + 12x^2y + 14x^2 + 15xy^2 + 18xy + 21x + 20y^2 + 24y + 28

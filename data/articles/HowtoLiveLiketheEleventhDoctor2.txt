 The Doctor would rescue people, ask them how they were feeling, and, treat them well. He showed that he didn't just care about himself, but for others, too. This will gain trust from other people, and they will care about you, also.
 No doubt about it, the Doctor helped anyone he could. It is such a joy, actually, to see someone safe and sound because of you, even if he/she is a stranger. To help you help others, ask yourself this when you're too busy to help the old woman carry her groceries to her house, "Would I want someone's help if I were that person/them?"

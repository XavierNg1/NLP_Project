 Use a measuring tape to do this. Then mark these parameters on the floor using painterâ€™s tape. You could also use yardsticks or other found objects to mark the parameters on the floor., If you do not have one large piece, then combine two or three medium sized pieces that complement each other. Place the large piece(s) slightly off-center, i.e., 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) off-center., Starting from the center and moving outward, place the smaller pieces of art around the larger, centered piece(s). Space the pieces at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart, but not more than 7 inches (17.8 cm).Make sure to space out large pieces.
Try pairing pieces together based on color, for example.
 Lay out your pieces of art in at least three different arrangements. Take a picture of each arrangement. Then go back to compare and contrast the arrangements and pick your favorite one.

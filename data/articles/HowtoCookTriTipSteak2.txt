 Set it to 475°F (245°C), with the rack on the upper third of the oven.
 Pat the steak dry with paper towels, brush with a light coating of olive oil, and rub vigorously with peppercorns and salt.
 Heat 1 tablespoon safflower oil in a heavy, oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering, then sear the steak on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes total.
 Place the skillet in the oven, and roast for about 10 minutes for medium rare. Remove from the oven, tent with tin foil, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes in a dish to catch any juices.
 Place the skillet back on the stove, and over medium-high heat add the red wine, scraping up the fond (the browned bits on the pan), and cook about a minute, until reduce by half.


Stir in the water and steak juices that have collected in the plate, bring to a boil, and cook 3 to 5 minutes, until the liquid is reduced again by half.
Stir in the butter, whisking until the butter is fully blended with the sauce.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.
 Cut the steak in half, then slice across the grain in about 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch (5 to 10mm) slices.
 Arrange a few slices on each plate, and dress with wine sauce. Serve with french fries, a green salad, and the same type of wine you used for the sauce.

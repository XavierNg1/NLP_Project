 This is a spring-loaded clip that holds the wiper arm in place, but is released by lifting the arm away from the windshield.
 This clip ensures that the wiper arm stays attached. Releasing it will allow you to remove the wiper arm from the base.









Locate a hole on each side of the arm near the hinge pin.
Lift the wiper arm fully up and off the windshield.
Slide a finish nail or other small diameter pin all the way through both of the clipâ€™s side holes. You may need to slightly rock the wiper blade away while attempting align the pin and slide it through.
Release the wiper arm and allow it to rest on the pin.
 Now that the clip is released, rock the wiper arm up and down by grasping with one hand on the arm and the other pulling at the point of attachment until the arm slides off the post.

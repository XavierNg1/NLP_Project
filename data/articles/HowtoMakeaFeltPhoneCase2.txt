 To make your case more interesting, consider using two different colors of felt. This way, one color will be on the inside, and the other color will be on the outside.


You are making the felt pieces twice the height of your phone because you will be folding them in half.
 Draw a line connecting this mark to the top left corner.This will make a front pocket for your case.
 If you want to have a pocket on both sides, fold the felt rectangle in half, first, then cut through both layers of feltThis will create identical pockets on both sides of the case. Discard the triangles you cut out, or save them for another project.
 Make sure that all the sides align. The cut piece of felt will go on the outside, and make the pockets.
 The uncut piece of felt will now be sandwiched in between the cut piece of felt. You will end up with a rectangle that is the same height as your phone.
 You want the case to be snug around your phone. Move the pins around until the case fits snugly around your phone. Once you are happy with the fit, slip your phone out.
 Pull the pins out as you go. You can match the thread color to your case, or use a contrasting color. You can sew this by hand, or on a sewing machine.
 Depending on how thick your phone is, you may need to cut down the seams. For a cleaner finish, cut them to within 2 millimeters of the stitching. For a more interesting finish, trim them using pinking shears.
 You can slide other items into the side pocket(s), such as credit cards and paper money.

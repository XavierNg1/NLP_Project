 Place a large, heavy-bottomed pot on your camping stove. Add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil and 4 chicken breasts with the skin and bone still in place, and heat them over medium-high until the chicken is golden brown, which should take 2 to 3 minutes per side.For the most flavorful dish, season both sides of the chicken breasts with salt and pepper before you brown them.
 Once the chicken is golden brown, add 1 red pepper that’s been julienned to the pot. Allow the pepper to cook until it becomes soft, which should take 1 to 2 minutes.You can substitute yellow peppers for the red if you prefer.
 When the pepper is soft, add ¼ cup (60 ml) of chopped, sun dried tomatoes and 1 ½ cups (350 ml) of Arborio rice to the pot. Mix well to combine them with the other ingredients, and cook the mixture for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the rice is slightly browned.You can substitute olives for the sun dried tomatoes if you prefer.
You can substitute another short-grain rice for the Arborio if you prefer.
 Once the rice is slightly browned, pour 3 cups (700 ml) of chicken stock to the pot. Allow the mixture to come to a boil, which should take 5 to 7 minutes., When the mixture has come to a boil, lower the heat to medium-low. Continue cooking the mixture until the chicken is cooked through and the rice is tender, which should take approximately 25 to 35 minutes.Be sure to stir the mixture occasionally as it cooks so the rice doesn’t stick to the pot.
 When the chicken and rice are finished cooking, remove the pot from the stove. Sprinkle some parsley and salt and pepper to taste over the dish, and serve while it’s warm.If you prefer, you can substitute basil for the parsley.

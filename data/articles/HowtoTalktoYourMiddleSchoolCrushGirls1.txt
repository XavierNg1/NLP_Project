 Make sure to say hi when you first see your crush everyday. If you pass them in the hall, wave and smile. If you see them in class, you can say, “Good morning! How’s it going?” This will help your crush notice and remember you., Find an excuse to be near them during the day. If you don’t have assigned seats, you can take the seat next to them in class, or you can eat near them at lunch time.

If you want, you can come up to them and say, “Hey, is this seat taken?”
If you’re feeling shy about approaching them, ask your friends if they would help you out. One of your friends can take a seat close to your crush, and you can sit next to your friend.
 A good way to break the ice is to ask your crush questions. Perhaps you need help with a math question or maybe you didn’t catch the homework. Always thank them when they give you the answer.For example, you can say, “Hey, I forgot my book today. Can I look onto yours?”
If your teacher says you need to work with a partner, you can ask your crush, “Do you want to work together on this?” Remember to smile as you say it!

, Once you have started talking, you can casually ask about their interests, hobbies, or plans. Try to find out what they’re interested in, and start talking to them about it.You can start the conversation by saying something about your own interests. For example, you can say, “Do you listen to this band? I have had their new song stuck in my head all day.” If they haven’t heard of the band, you might ask, “So what kind of music do you like?”

, Look for ways to connect over common interests, hobbies, or practices. If you know they enjoy something, you can start a conversation about it, or you can invite them to do the activity with you.

Look at their clothes, bags, and other belongings for clues about what they enjoy. For example, you can say, “I noticed the pins on your bag. Do you like anime too?”

 Is there a special feature you feel you'll use? If you're, say, preoccupied with bad breath, you may want a toothbrush with a tongue cleaner. If you're environmentally conscious, you may want a toothbrush that's easily recyclable and made from organic materials.Most drug stores and supermarkets sell a wide variety of toothbrushes, so finding special feature is rarely a problem. You can browse the selection at a drugstore near you to find a toothbrush that suits your needs.
However, not all special feature are available at every store. If you're looking for a very niche feature, you may have to purchase a toothbrush online.
 Manual toothbrushes are operated just with your hands. Electronic toothbrushes have a motor that moves the bristles for you as you move the toothbrush over your mouth. Decide whether you want an electronic or manual toothbrush.The main benefit of an electronic toothbrush is it can give you a deeper clean. It's also great if you have a condition like arthritis, as electronic toothbrushes do much of the work for you.
Electronic toothbrushes tend to be expensive, however, and the heads need to be replaced every three to four months. If you're on a tight budget, and do not have any health conditions that make brushing your teeth difficult, you may want to opt for a manual toothbrush.
Another major disadvantage of having an electronic toothbrush is that you might forget how to brush properly. The most effective brushing technique is still the manual one where you can brush your teeth and gums using vertical strokes.
 Most toothbrushes should be replaced every three to four months. When selecting special features, keep the cost in mind. While a toothbrush with a tongue cleaner may seem convenient, if it's twice as expensive as a regular toothbrush, it may not be worth the money. Instead, you could spend a few bucks on floss or and interdental brush. You can clean your tongue with a conventional toothbrush and save yourself some money.

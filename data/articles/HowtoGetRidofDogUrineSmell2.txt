 If your dog’s urine stain has set for a long time and the smell is strong, you will first need to dilute the stain. Get a bowl of warm water, and use a two clean towels towel to alternately dampen and blot dry the stained spot. Do this several times to dilute the stain, and smell, as much as possible.


You may want to wear rubber gloves for this.
Your towels may start to take on some of the odor. However unpleasant, this is what you want, as it indicates you are drawing the smell out of the soiled area. Swap out your towels and continue diluting the stain as much as possible.
 Once you have diluted the odor as much as possible, use an enzyme neutralizer, such as Nature’s Miracle or Angry Orange. These cleaners break down protein-based molecules in urine that can cause bad odors. After doing a test for colorfastness on a hidden area of your carpet or upholstery, spray the area thoroughly with the cleaner and let stand for 5-10 minutes. Blot dry with a clean towel., If an odor remains after using the enzyme neutralizer, remove slipcovers from any soiled items and launder with cool water. Air dry to avoid shrinkage in the dryer..


If your dog has peed a carpet, consider replacing the rug pad beneath. These can contain synthetic materials that are more difficult to purge bad odors from.

 Select a Mii that will represent you. Then, enter your height and birthday.;
, Turn on the board, then step on it when you are told. When it asks you how heavy your clothes are, choose either heavy (4 lbs.), light (2 lbs.), or you can enter the weight (press other) with your remote.
 After you do this, it will measure you.
 It may be off to the left or the right, or, if you have good posture, in the middle. It also shows you a scale that has the categories underweight, normal,at risk of being overweight, and overweight. There is a little bar that shows you what category you're in and it also tells you your BMI (body mass index). It creates an image of your body type. You do two tests (like balance, etc.) and at the end, it tells you your Wii fit age. Try to get it as close to your actual age as you can. Then you get to set a goal for yourself. You set how much heavier or lighter you want to be, and in how long (like in weeks or months).
 The longer you've been registered, you get to unlock more stamps.
 You get your own Fit Piggy that puts in minutes after every game (like if the game is five minutes, it puts five minutes into the bank). That upgrades for the amount of time you use in Wii Fit like (10 hours {total} you get bronze Piggy, 20 hours {total} you get silver, then gold later on).

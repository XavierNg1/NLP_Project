 When they are in use, provide appropriate surfaces for drawing, and supervise. This is as much for the child's safety as for your walls.


A plastic tablecloth makes a good drop cloth (whether on the table or the floor), especially for messier art projects, such as painting.;
, Use short, direct language. When art work goes wandering, redirect the toddler. If the child persists, take away the materials immediately.


If weather is mild, have the toddler explore chalk art on the pavement or sidewalk outdoors. Funneling this creative energy outside can prevent it inside.






In snowy weather, build snow structures outside and paint with water and food coloring or watercolor paint.
Purchase bath paint or crayons, which can be used at bath time. It allows the child to draw on walls, and make bath time more fun.



Decide which wall is going to be approved for your toddler to write on. Measure this space's width, and about a foot over your toddler's head.
Take two to four pieces of large, white poster board, overlap them, and tape them together on the back side, so the finished piece will be about 2 inches (5.1Â cm) short of what you measured.
Center the new piece on the wall of choice. Tape the poster board onto the wall, using the 2" wide blue painters tape, (get at any hardware store). The tape should cover 1" of poster board all the way around, and right up to the edge of door frame, or corner. The blue tape won't take the paint off when you take it down.
Cover the poster board with a layer of butcher paper or other large paper, if you prefer. This will make it easier to replace when it gets filled up.
Explain this is the wall they can write on, and not to write on or outside the tape. If they write on any other wall, they will be disciplined.
As the pieces get filled, you can now save your toddler's fine art work. (This can also be fun to use as wrapping paper, especially for gifts for grandparents!)

 Open the application drawer located at the bottom of the home screen, and scroll through to find Google. It should be a blue square icon with a lowercase “g” in the middle. Tap to open.
 It should display the 3 most-recent search items.
 Press and hold a finger on one of the search items. There will be a box that pops up that will say “Remove from search history.” Tap “OK” to delete the search item.


Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all the search history you want to delete as there is no “Delete all” option for this method.

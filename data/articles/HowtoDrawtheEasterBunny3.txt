 Draw a big oval, in the middle to the part of the page.
 On top of each side of the oval draw two long and thin ovals.
 Draw over the right part of the head and right ear a big oval.
 Under the lower part of the body oval draw a flat and long oval. And a semicircle, facing down, inside the right part of the body oval.
 This will be a cute and fluffy tail.
 Under the left side of the body semicircle and in front of the back paws, draw two sets of overlapping ovals.
, Don't forget the big eye, cute little nose, little paws, the fluffy little tail, and some hair tufts all over the body. Shape the basket and draw a few easter eggs inside it.
 Finished!

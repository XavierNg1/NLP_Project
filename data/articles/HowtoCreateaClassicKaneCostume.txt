 Don't worry about the quality, because the mask will cover it.;
,


You can either make the mask out of a generic mask that covers your entire face and black and red paint (faster, but less professional looking), papier-mâché (will yield better results, but it's time consuming), or just simply buy an authentic Kane mask (best looking, but expensive).
In order to keep the mask on your face, you need to have elastic strap around it.



Get a red long-sleeve t-shirt, cut off the left sleeve, and paint the top half the shirt black in a jagged line design.



Get a pair of red pants, and draw the designs on the sides (jagged design on the right leg, two black stripes down with cross stitch between them on the left) with a black paint.



Get a black right glove, studded wristbands, studded belt, and pair of black boots.
 You might get some extra candy.

 SkyBoxes are the skies around you when you play Roblox. They can be stormy or even inside a computer. You can search for SkyBoxes in the Roblox free models list when you build your place. Be sure to search for SkyBoxes like "Nighttime" or "Full Moon.";
, Haunted houses are very overdone and end up being just a one day sensation before they start losing visits. Create a place different from a haunted house, like a "Cave Crypt" or "Doomed Temple."

, Don't model your place after somewhere in "Fallout" or "Left 4 Dead" because they are overused. Try games like "Rayman 2: The Great Escape" which has scary and mysterious places like "The Tomb of the Ancients" or "Beneath the Sanctuary of Rock and Lava." These offer new ideas to the theme of scary, and you might just end up starting a new trend on Roblox if your scary place gets enough visits.
 This adds the "adventurous" theme to your scary place, and make them well hidden. Ideas for badges would be "You found the Mario reference" or "You discovered the secret crack in the wall" which make people want to find exciting new things.
 Don't even add ghosts to give your place the lonely and scary feeling.
 This will create an even bigger feeling of loneliness as more people contributes to people saying, "Hey, this isn't that scary with all of us here!" Disabling Bubble Chat also helps because you won't know where other people are and you will be scouting to see where they are, unless they reveal their locations via Menu Chat.


A way around this is by disabling chat altogether. To do this, simply create a new script in Workspace with the code:

, Put some dark matter on the ground that kills on touch, and add some logs or boulders on top of the dark matter as stepping stones.
, Add no text, just the face of a scary looking ghost. Most people get thousands of visits bidding amounts of 5000-7000 Tix on ads.

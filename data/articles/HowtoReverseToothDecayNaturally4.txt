 Your teeth are a type of tissue made up of minerals with a hard exterior called enamel. The enamel covers dentin, which is softer than enamel. These layers protect the pulp, which is made up of nerves and blood supply to your teeth. This enamel can be damaged by bacteria in a process called demineralization, leading to cavities, tooth decay, and other dental problems., Tooth decay is caused by bacteria, which is prevalent on your teeth, gums, tongue, throat, and inside your cheeks.This is perfectly normal and helpful to overall health, but it can also damage the your teeth and mouth if it becomes overgrown.


These bacteria form colonies, called dental plaques, which feed on sugars you consume. The bacteria then produce acids that cause your teeth to decay., Your teeth will naturally demineralize if exposed to too much acid, the leading cause of the issue, as well as from bacteria. Major causes of decay include:The formation of bacteria plaques
Abundant ingestion of overly acidic beverages, such as flavored waters with added citric acid, sports drinks, and sodas
Eating a lot of citrus fruit, such as lemons, oranges, grapefruit, and limes
GastroEsophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), in which stomach acid can come back into your mouth
Use of drugs such as methamphetamines
Improper or inadequate dental hygiene
Smoking
Systemic inflammation or infections

 Once you emerge from the cave after escaping the dragon who attacked Helgen, follow the path to Riverwood. It does not matter who you chose to follow—both Ralof and Hadvar will head to Riverwood as well. It is possible to lose them and arrive there first.;
, Alvor is the town’s blacksmith in Riverwood and is located on the left-hand side on the street leading into Riverwood. Gerdur can be found at the lumber mill in Riverwood. Both contacts will tell you to contact the Jarl of Whiterun on the dragon attack.You can also go directly to Whiterun without speaking to Alvor or Gerdur.
 Exit Riverwood to the north and follow the eastern path with the nearby rapids. Immediately head west once you cross over the bridge closest to Whiterun. You will pass the Chillfurrow Farm and the Honningbrew Meadery. Continue the path to Whiterun until you reach the main gates. A guard will stop you and tell you the city is closed due to the recent dragon attack. Tell the guard that Riverwood calls for aid and he will let you through.
 The Jarl can be found in Dragonsreach, the building towering over the others in the city. Once you enter Whiterun, go straight until you reach the market square and make a left up the stairs. Pass the large tree and make your way up the flight of stairs to Dragonsreach.
 Start a discussion with the Jarl regarding the recent dragon attacks. Once you have finished talking, the quest will be completed. You will be rewarded with either heavy or light armor which has a chance of a random enchantment.

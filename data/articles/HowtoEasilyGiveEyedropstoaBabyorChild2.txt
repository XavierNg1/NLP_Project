 This will restrain the babyâ€™s arms. Otherwise, the baby might flail or rub away the medicine. By swaddling them, you will be ensuring that they remain still throughout the procedure., It is easiest to place the baby on your lap. Make sure that their head is closest to you with their body extended out along your legs., With a finger, press down on the skin below their eye and gently pull it down. You only want to pull down enough to expose the lower whites of their eye. There should be a small gap for the medicine to go in. Be extremely gentle as you do this. You do not want to upset the baby, nor do you want to injure them.If the baby is upset or wiggling, ask another adult to help. They can help hold the baby's head still while you quickly put the drops in. This will also free your hands to help with applying the drops., Bring the dropper within one inch of their eye, but make sure that it is not touching any part of the eye, including their eye lashes. Squeeze the medicine along their lower eyelid. As they blink, watch to make sure that the medicine touches their eye., If you are having difficulty putting the medicine into their eyes while they are open, you can try applying the medicine while their eyes are closed. This can be done while they are asleep. Drop the medicine into their closed eye along the corner closest to their nose. If your baby opens their eyes, it will run into their eyeballs.
If they do not open their eyes, you can open their eyes for them. With your index finger resting on their brow and your thumb on their cheek, gently pull open their eyelids so that the medicine runs in.
 Once you are certain that the medicine has reached their eyeball, you may clean up any excess that has dripped around their eyes. Use a tissue to gently remove the liquid from the lower and upper lid, eye lashes, and cheek. Do not touch their eyeball.

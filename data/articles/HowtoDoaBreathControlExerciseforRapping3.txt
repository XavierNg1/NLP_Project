 Exercise is one of the best ways to improve your lung capacity and your ability to control your breathing. The type of exercise that’s right for you depends on the equipment available to you as well as your limitations. For instance, if you have bad knees, running can cause pain and damage to these vulnerable joints.Some options for cardiovascular exercise include:


Swimming
Cycling
Rowing

, Not warming up properly can lead to a host of injuries, such as pulled muscles and sprained ankles.Perform a light cardiovascular exercise (such as jumping jacks) and stretch.
 This means you’re pushing yourself as hard as you can for the entire 20 seconds. Rather than performing low impact cardiovascular training for extended periods of time, you’ll want to use high intensity interval training (HIIT). While both are effective for improving your lung capacity, HIIT workouts are more efficient as they’re usually completed in a fraction of the time.If you’re already in good physical shape, you can increase your work time to 30 or 40 seconds for a more strenuous workout.
If swimming, be careful not to push yourself too hard as you could risk drowning.
 After your 20 seconds of work, lower your pace to a point where you’re able to talk and catch your breath. For instance, if you’re running, you’ll slow to a light jog for 40 seconds. The pace should be just enough to keep your heart rate going while still giving you a chance to recover.


If you’re in good physical shape, try decreasing your recovery time to 30 or 20 seconds.
 The total workout should take approximately 10 minutes to complete.Start by doing this workout a few times a week, and you should notice your lung capacity and breathing improve.

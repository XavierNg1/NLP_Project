 Make the strips 10cm/4 inches in width. The amount needed will depend on the size of the wreath you're covering; test wrap with the first strip to gauge how long the fabric should be. If the wreath is very large, several strips may be needed but one strip should suffice for a small wreath.
 If you need to make joins, overlap the fabric neatly and glue in place. Glue the end piece in place. When gluing, keep the fabric as flat as possible, to avoid making lumps., Again, glue any joins neatly in place and glue the end piece off neatly. Any joins and the end piece should be at the back of the wreath, so as to not show when on display., Leave gaps of about 5cm/2 inches between each following wrap; there should be plenty of the underlying organza and lam√© fabrics showing through, as the ribbon is simply a decorative addition. As you wrap, glue the ribbon in place., Make a 4 to 6 loop bow, so that it appears voluminous. Tie in the middle with some of the small ribbon. Check that it looks even and make any adjustments as needed.

Cut the edges in "V" shapes to prevent fraying.
, The wreath is now ready for hanging.

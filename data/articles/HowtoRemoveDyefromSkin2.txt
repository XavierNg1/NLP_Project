 If you are not able to get stubborn hair dye off your skin, consider investing in an over-the-counter stain remover. Many drug stores sell stain removers that can remove excess color from the ends of your hair, any stains on your clothes, and any stains on your skin.
 For very easy application, look for hair dye remover wipes at your local drug store. These wipes dissolve any color stains on your skin and are often made with products that will not irritate your skin.
 Your hairdresser may be able to recommend a stain removal product for your skin type and based on the type of dye you used on your hair. Ask her for advice, but be prepared for her to scold you for not getting your hair professionally dyed!

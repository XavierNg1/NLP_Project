 For the best root yield, plant chicory after the last day in March, and before mid-May. Collect the roots between September 1st and November 15th., Use a hand trowel gently, as needed, to coax the root out of the ground, without nicking or bruising it.The roots may be as deep as two feet (61 cm) in the ground.Roots have crowns five to seven inches (13 to 18 cm) in diameter, and tapered taproots. The usable portion of each root is about nine to ten inches (23 to 25 cm).If you don’t want the tops of the plants, they can be added to a compost pile.
 Clip the tops off at two inches (five centimeters) above the roots. Store them in a humid location at 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 4 degrees Celsius) for up to three months., Scrub the roots with a plastic-bristled brush. Chop them into pieces on a cutting board with a sharp, heavy knife. You can also grind them with a strong grinder. Then use them for roasting and/or brewing., After the first frost, dig out roots that have a top diameter of at least 1.5-2 inches (3.8 to 5 cm). Dig them up carefully so that you don’t bruise them, which may lead to rot. Leave the leaves intact.Place the roots side by side in a garden, covered with straw, or in boxes of sand in a cool, dark, frost-free place until needed.”Forcing” vegetables is when you move them to an artificial growing environment, such as a greenhouse, to produce a harvest outside of the normal growing season.
Chicory roots should never be frozen, since freezing temperatures change the chemical makeup of the roots.

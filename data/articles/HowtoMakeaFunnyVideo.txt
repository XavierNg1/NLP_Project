 You'll need a camera man, actors, a director, and a writer. The actors should be people familiar with comedy, or people who enjoy having a good laugh.;
, Pass them around and get some feedback from everyone involved. When you think you're satisfied, go ahead and move on to the next step.
 Be inspired by their ideas and scripts. Don't copy, but learn what works and what doesn't, as well as watching carefully for timing.
 Depending on the script, you can use simple places such as your own living room, kitchen, or even a hallway. However, if your script is more detailed and involves a lot of acting, you may want to choose a more scenic venue like a local park, a business part of town, or a spot with a view.
 Everyone who is good with making jokes and writing can get involved in this step. Share the script around for improvements.
 Although the script will be the backbone, actors will inevitably come up with funnier, wittier, and more obvious ways to make the filming funny and you should be prepared to add these into the filming.
 Many of the funniest film scenes result from this.
 If it was funny then, it's likely to be funny now. However, if you have to 'be a part of the group' to understand the joke, then it probably isn't the best one to use. So if you've found something that works, try to adapt it to fit into your script.
 Then it's lights, camera, and.... ACTION! Ensure that there is a good director with a sense of comic timing and the ability to direct actors out of the giggles and dead ends.
 You can use something simple like iMovie or Windows Movie Maker, or you can buy some editing software.


Some things are not funny no matter how they may seem at the time to those in fits of laughter, so be prepared to edit with care and sensitivity to what's funny to the audience.

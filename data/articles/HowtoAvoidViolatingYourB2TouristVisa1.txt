 The deadline won’t actually be on your visa. However, it should be noted on the admission stamp placed in your passport. You can also find the deadline on your Arrival/Departure Form I-94.You can get the form in the following ways:


If you entered the United States by land port, then you should be given a paper copy.
If you entered the country by air or sea, then you will have to print off a copy from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website.Enter your name, passport number, and the country that issued your passport.;
, You should make preparations not to overstay your visa. If you do, then you will be considered “out of status,” which means you are in the U.S. illegally. Also, if you had a multiple entry visa, then it will be voided.Overstaying a visa also might make you ineligible for future visas.
Make sure to plan a departure date before your visa’s expiration date.
 Your plans might change. For example, you might want to spend more time with your family, or you might have suffered a medical emergency. You have the option of applying for an extension to your B-2 tourist visa.


Extensions are not automatic. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigrations Services (USCIS) department has discretion whether to grant extensions.
You can extend your visa by completing Form I-539, which is available for download online.You will have to pay a $290 filing fee.

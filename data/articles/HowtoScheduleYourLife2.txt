 To-do lists help you keep track of all the tasks you have on your plate. It’s a good idea to have several lists: one for today, one for the week or month, and one for the whole year. This will help you maintain a big-picture view of your responsibilities without getting overwhelmed.Be thoughtful about what you put on your to-do list. Only include tasks that matter to you and that you’re prepared to actually do.
Three to five items is a good length for a daily to-do list.
 You can get organized and reduce your stress levels by deciding ahead of time when you’ll do specific tasks. Break your day into blocks of time, and assign activities like doing homework, answering emails, and cooking meals to certain blocks.When you write your plan down, you won’t have to expend energy trying to remember it.
 Arrange your schedule so that you can tackle the most important things on your to-do list during your peak productivity time. For many people, this window occurs a few hours after waking up.Obligations like classes and meetings might prevent you from working during your most productive time of day. If you can’t change your schedule, look for the second-best time of day to do your important work.
 Commit all your attention to one task before you move on to another. Multitasking might make you feel productive, but it actually makes you less efficient overall.If you tend to get sidetracked, look for ways to block out distractions. Close your door, put on noise-canceling headphones, or go somewhere without Wi-Fi to get your work done.
 Identify the basic tasks you need to do over and over again, like cooking or getting your kids ready for school. Come up with some efficient methods for doing these tasks, and repeat these methods until they’re a daily habit.For instance, you might want to create a new morning routine or a weekend meal prep routine.
When you can do simple tasks on autopilot, you free your mind to focus on more challenging things.

 Check for any scratches or scrapes in the wood, and use putty or a wood filler to even out the marks or holes. This will create a smooth surface on the pine. Wood fillers can be found at hardware stores.;
, Use a hand-held sanding pad or an electric sander and rub it over the wood to make the surface smooth and even. This process will prepare pine for painting.


After sanding, make sure the pine surface is smooth. Run a damp cloth over it. This will eliminate any dust or debris that resulted from the sanding step.
 This step is essential before painting because it will provide a treated surface, and will ensure that the paint sticks to the pine. Use a brush to apply primer in the direction of the wood grain. It may look splotchy on the wood, even when applied in consistent strokes. It does not go on uniformly, and it does not have to look perfect at this stage. Leave the primer to dry overnight.
 Use a paint brush to apply the paint over the primer. Using a 2 inch (5.1Â cm) paint brush will ensure even results. A medium sized brush will cover the furniture with large strokes of paint while still allowing for attention to detail around smaller parts of the pine. Paint in the direction of the wood grain with smooth, even strokes. Leave the first coat to dry overnight.
 Once that coat dries, apply a third coat to get an even color covering on the pine. Three coats will give the pine a bright, consistent shade.
 To make sure the paint has dried completely, do not use or touch the pine furniture for 1 full week.

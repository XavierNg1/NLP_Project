 Air intakes are devices on all vehicles that allow the engine to mix air with fuel, thus making combustion possible. While the air intake will always be attached to the engine housed beneath the hood, different manufacturers produce their vehicles to different specifications, and so air intakes are located in different locations on different vehicles. Consult your vehicle’s user guide to identify the location of your air intake.Air intakes often look like metal tubes. They might be powder-coated or painted in the same color as the vehicle.
 Keep the can of starting fluid upright. Aim the can’s nozzle at the air intake from about 12 inches (20 centimeters) away. Spray the starting fluid for about two seconds, then try to turn the engine over. If the engine still doesn’t turn over, spray another two-second blast.You many need to remove the filter covering your air intake to do this., If the engine won’t start even with an appropriate application of starting fluid, the engine itself might not be the problem. For instance, your car’s ignition switch might be faulty, or some other system could be to blame. Talk to a reputable mechanic in your area and get their opinion on how to handle the problem.

 Choose one that has solid glass walls and a strong base, as it needs to hold candies and be safe for a child to handle. Ice cream sundae glasses are one possible choice.


Check thrift stores or charity shops to find unwanted glassware at a cheap price.
Another alternative is a glass jar, such as a Mason jar, attached to a candlestick base. Glue well using glue meant for glassware. Allow the glue to dry thoroughly before painting.
 Use paint suitable for glassware. Paint one layer and allow to dry. Paint another layer if the first layer isn't sufficient. Always allow for drying time before layers.


Spray painting is easier than brush painting. Be sure to paint all of the nooks and crannies.
 Glue two googly eyes above the red pompom.
 Wind two brown or fawn colored pipe cleaners around a stick to curl them. Leave one end with straight pieces to be stuck onto the glass. Glue these onto the glass on either side to form antlers.
 Pile it high!

 Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil to a large skillet. Heat the oil on high until it begins to shimmer, which should take 3 to 5 minutes.For the best results, use a cast iron or stainless steel skillet to saute the morels.
You can substitute canola oil for the vegetable oil if you prefer.
 Once the oil is heated, add 8 ounces (227 g) of morel mushrooms that have been cleaned, trimmed, and cut in half to the skillet. Allow the mushrooms to cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until they are well browned.Occasionally stir and toss the mushrooms as you saute them to ensure that they cook evenly.
 When the mushrooms are browned, reduce the heat on the stove to medium-high. Mix in a small minced shallot and a minced medium garlic clove, and let the mixture cook until it becomes fragrant, which should take 45 seconds to minute.If you’re not a fan of garlic, you can leave it out of the dish.
If you enjoy a strong garlic flavor, you can increase the amount to 2 or 3 cloves.
 After the morel mixture has become fragrant, add 2 tablespoons (28 g) of unsalted butter, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of soy sauce, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of fresh lemon juice, and ¼ cup (59 ml) of low-sodium chicken stock to the skillet. Allow the mixture to cook until the liquid reduces and a creamy sauce develops, which should take approximately 1 minute.You can use store-bought or homemade chicken stock.
If you prefer, you can substitute water for the chicken stock.
 Once the morels are coated in a creamy sauce, mix in 1 tablespoon (4 g) of minced fresh parsley. Season the dish with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste, and serve it while it’s still hot.You can substitute fresh chives or chervil for the parsley.

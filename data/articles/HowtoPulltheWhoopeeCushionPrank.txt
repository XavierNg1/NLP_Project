 These can be bought at a convenience store for about a dollar. Try not to get the ones that say "Whoopee Cushion" on it. Try to get one with just plain colors with little to no words.If you can, try to buy one with the same colors as the thing you are putting under to be even less noticeable.;
, Blow it up slightly. Not to the point it is full, this will give away the cushion. Fill it up about halfway.
 Don't put it above the cushion of the place, put it under or under a pillow.
 Don't just say "Sit here", this will make it noticeable that you have something up your sleeve. Strike up a conversation and say "Here, let's sit down". Don't act too eager either; don't keep smiling and snickering. Just wait for them to sit on the cushion.
 Don't start randomly laughing and slapping your knee. Announce it and wait to see if people laugh. If they do, laugh to. But don't laugh first!

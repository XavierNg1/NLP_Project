This will be your monkey’s head.



For the body, draw a letter “U” under the circle. Tend to make the letter U a bit smaller than the head.
Add a long swirly tail.



Draw 2 ‘arms’ on the upper body and 2 more legs on the lower body.
The arms and legs don't have to be proportional to the body; making it a bit long is okay. It depends on the artist’s preference.



Draw 2 ovals at each side of the head to form ears. Add another oval at the bottom part of the head for the muzzle.
For the hands, just draw small circles.
For the feet, draw longer ovals.



Draw a small heart-shaped in the upper part of the muzzle for the nostrils.
draw two circles for the eyes, making it a bit exaggerated is okay. Again, it depends on the artist’s preference.



After drawing the lineart, always remember erase the pencil sketch to keep the drawing neat.



Add lines for the ears and the belly.

 Before removing the brake light switch, you need to be sure the pigtail is disconnected. If you already disconnected it to inspect it for damage, leave it hanging as you remove the switch. If not, disconnect it now by pressing on the plastic release and pulling back on the plastic housing.Unless the pigtail harness needs to be replaced, you will reuse it with the new brake light switch.
If you break the release, you may be able to use electric tape to hold the pigtail in place upon reassembly to avoid purchasing a new one.
 Different vehicles mount the brake light switch to the pedal linkage in different ways. If it is not readily apparent how to remove the switch from the pedal, refer to the service manual for your specific year, make and model vehicle.The switch is usually held in place with one or two small bolts.
Be careful not to lose the mounting hardware. You will need to reuse them when installing the new switch.
 With the old switch removed, slide the new switch into place exactly where the old one was. Use the mounting hardware that held the previous switch in place to secure the new one in the same manner.Replace the bolts that secure the switch if they were damaged in the process of removing them.
 Plug the brake light switch pigtail into the new switch and reattach any other connections you may have needed to disconnect in your specific vehicle. The switch should now be in place behind the shaft of the brake pedal and connected to the vehicle.Reconnect the battery and start the vehicle.
Have a friend stand behind the vehicle while you test the new brake light switch to confirm itâ€™s working.

 You want to work on contracting your pubococcygeus (PC) muscle, which is located between your anus and urinary sphincter. To find it, try stopping your flow while peeing. When you get it to stop, that is the muscle you are working. Give yourself some time to tighten and contract the muscle during the day, three sets of 15 contractions, which will make it stronger and give you more confidence to use it if you need to slow down.Consider doing other, similar exercises that work your pelvic muscles, including yoga, kegels, and pilates. These can allow you to strengthen these muscles, and will give you better control over yourself.;
, About an hour or two before sex, take some time to stimulate yourself and ejaculate. It takes men some time to recover between finishing, so doing so a little bit beforehand will help you slow down., Another way to help yourself last longer is to train yourself while masturbating. Get yourself close to finishing, then stop and slowly calm down. Build yourself back up, then calm down again.This technique will help you learn your limits, and how far you can push yourself before the point of no return. Once you know these limits, you will be better able to control yourself before getting to the point where you can’t stop.
 If your problems are related to performance anxiety, it may be helpful to take a little break. Talk to a doctor and your partner about avoiding sex for a set period of time.This doesn’t mean losing intimacy. Use this time without intercourse to focus on other types of sexual play. This will help you learn to create pleasure for both yourself and your partner, taking the pressure away when you get back to having sex.

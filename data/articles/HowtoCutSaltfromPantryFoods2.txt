 Popcorn can be a healthy snack, but many prepackaged versions contain large amounts of added salt. Instead of movie theater butter or salted popcorn, choice plain microwavable bags. You can buy the plain kernels and pop them in an air popper for even fresher popcorn.If you want to add some flavor, consider sprinkling cinnamon over it for something sweet or adding a dash of garlic or seasoning salt.
 Nuts are a delicious, healthy snack and a common pantry item. However, many nuts are covered in salt. Replace your salted peanuts, almonds, and mixed nuts with unsalted varieties. You still get delicious flavor without all the unnecessary salt., Chips contain high levels of sodium. To cut salt from your pantry, find an alternative to potato and corn chips. Try finding a low-sodium cracker or try cucumbers and carrots for a crunchy snack instead. Look for a chip or cracker that contains less than 200 mg of sodium per serving.Some brands carry reduced sodium or no salt added chips. Read the label and decide if the sodium content is low enough to be a healthy swap.
If you are basing the sodium content on the serving size, make sure to eat one serving. Measure it out. It is easy to go over the serving size and eat too much sodium.

 Set it to the highest heat setting. If it has a steam setting, turn this off. A dry heat is best for removing the melted plastic or wax., An alternative for the brown paper bag is wax paper. Be careful not to use thin paper, as it can overheat the plastic or wax and cause a worse mess. Avoid paper with any writing on it, because the heat can cause the ink to transfer onto the fabric or carpet., Donâ€™t push down too hard or stay on one section too long, because you do not want the substance to melt farther into the carpet or fabric. The goal is to get the plastic or wax to stick to the bag.
 This should be done while the paper is still warm from the iron. The plastic or wax should stick to the paper, leaving the surface clean.
 If there are still bits stuck to the carpet afterwards, try gently scrubbing the area with a carpet or fabric cleaner. The remaining pieces may budge with a little bit of friction.

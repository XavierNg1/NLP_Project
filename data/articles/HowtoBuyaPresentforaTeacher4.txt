 Purchasing fudge, cookies, popcorn, or any other gourmet treat from a local candy shop or grocery store is widely accepted and appreciated by teachers. It is usually best if this item is non-perishable, and is only big enough for one to enjoy., Gift baskets typically have several treats and knick knacks that your teacher may enjoy, especially if you’re careful about what kind of theme you choose for your basket.

If you’re giving your teacher a holiday basket before winter break, you might consider giving a wellness basket with tea and other goodies to keep your teacher warm and healthy during the cold winter.
If you notice that your teacher drinks coffee in the mornings, you might consider giving a breakfast basket complete with coffee beans and breakfast cookies.
 While your efforts would be appreciated, many teachers will not eat homemade baked goods for sanitary reasons. It’s usually best to stick to a pre-packaged treat., There are many people who are allergic to one or many different types of food. To avoid causing harm to your teacher, make sure that they do not have any allergies. If your teacher does have food allergies, make sure to read the label of the treat that you buy to be certain that none of those ingredients are in it.

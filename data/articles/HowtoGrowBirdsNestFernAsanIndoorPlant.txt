 Be sure to use soil that permits excellent drainage as this fern does not like waterlogged feet.


Also ensure that the pot is able to drain water with ease. Filling the saucer with marbles, glass pebbles or real pebbles can help make drainage better, as well as allowing for evaporation to create humidity.;

Add water directly to the soil.
Test the soil to see how moist it is. Poke your finger into the soil; if it is moist, the plant doesn't yet need watering. If it is dry, it needs watering.
 Use a regular spray bottle and mist the leaves directly.
 If it is situated next to a window, make sure that the light is filtered through a lightweight curtain.
 A light feeding plant, keep the dosages of fertilizer low. If the fern is over-fertilized, the fronds can slow down in growth and may become deformed.


Avoid fertilizers with urea or high ammonia nitrogen content.
 This will keep the fern in excellent shape, and ensures that the plant has space to grow healthily.

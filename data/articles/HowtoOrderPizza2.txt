Name and email address
Address
Credit card information
Telephone number

 Like buying from Amazon or other online outlets, you'll have to confirm your address and contact information and confirm your order by clicking "Yes" a bunch of times and deciding how you'll pay.


Typically, you can still select "Cash" if you want to wait until the pizza arrives and pay for it in analog form. You can also pay with your credit card and include a tip right on it. Make sure you read the form carefully before confirming your order and pay how you'd like.
 After you confirm an order, they'll usually send you an email instead of providing you a physical receipt. Check your email to make sure that it's arrived and save your order number in the case the pizza doesn't arrive in a timely fashion. Sit back and wait for the pizza to arrive.

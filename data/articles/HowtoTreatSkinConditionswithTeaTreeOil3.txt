 The antibacterial properties of tea tree oil, mainly due to a component called terpin-4-ol, have been known to heal boils caused by staph infections, including the problematic infection known as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).Applying tea tree oil several times a day until the infection is gone may help just as much as antibiotics.
 Any time that you get an infection in an opening of your skin, consider applying a diluted form of tea tree oil to help reduce the inflammation. Tea tree oil’s anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties help infections heal.
 Ringworm is a fungus that manifests in a red, raised, circular bump on the skin. Tea tree oil’s anti-fungal properties can take care of this unsightly ring through repeated application. Try soaking a cotton ball in water, adding 3 drops of oil to it, and rubbing it on the ring 1 or 2 times a day until it disappears.
 Other kinds of fungus can be eliminated through use of tea tree oil. Its antifungal properties have been shown to take care of dermatophytes, fungi that can infect hair, skin, and nails.


Tea tree oil can fight fungi that cause athlete’s foot and other nail and feet infections (called onychomycosis and interdigital tinea pedis).Soak a cotton ball in water, then add two or three drops of tea tree to it. Rub this cotton over each nail or on your foot, letting your nails dry or washing it off of your skin.

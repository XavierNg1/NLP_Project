 If you live in a very cold climate, you will need to grow the plants indoors. This can be easily done provided you have a space near a window somewhere so that the plants can get sunlight each day. Choose pots that will fit in your home and make sure that you have non-leaking saucers under each pot. For those lucky enough to be able to keep growing during winter, plant your winter salad vegetables in the garden bed as usual.;
, There is a wide selection of plants suitable for growing at wintertime. These include:
Lamb's lettuce (Valerianella locusta) - this is also known as corn salad. It is a very popular salad green in Europe, where it is also known as mache.






Cos lettuces are a good choice - look for miniature varieties if you are growing indoors, as well as the heirloom varieties such as "Rouge d'hiver".






Chicory - this is a slightly bitter salad green that adds life to a winter salad.






Rocket/arugula - always a salad favourite at any time of year







, Cover against frost if you are growing outdoors and be sure not to let salad vegetables dry out if grown in a heated environment indoors.
 If you stagger your planting, you should be able to have a crop of winter salads continuously through winter and into spring. Freshly picked food is always the very best for our health.

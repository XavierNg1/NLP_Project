 Many butchers don't sell pre-cut lamb steaks. However, your butcher will be happy to cut them for you from a whole leg of lamb. One leg of lamb will typically yield six steaks, each large enough for one serving size.Ask for steaks cut about 2/3-inch thick. This allows for a quick cooking time and tender results.
If your butcher doesn't have a leg of lamb, this method can also be used to cook lamb chops.;
, Peel and chop the garlic into fine pieces. Mix the garlic, rosemary, olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper in a shallow baking dish or another nonreactive dish. This marinade will penetrate the steaks for a tender result. If you're in the mood for a different flavor combination, try one of these:


Yogurt mint marinade: mix 1/2 cup whole milk yogurt, 2 cloves minced garlic, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1/4 cup chopped mint, and salt and pepper to taste.Tandoori-spiced marinade: mix 1/2 cup whole milk yogurt, 1/4 cup lime juice, 2 minced garlic cloves, 1 teaspoon minced ginger, 1 teaspoon sweet paprika, 1 teaspoon coriander, 1 teaspoon cumin,1 teaspoon turmeric, 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard, 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon salt.Barbecue marinade: Mix 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup malt vinegar, 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 tablespoons tomato sauce and 1/2 teaspoon salt.Mustard marinade: Mix 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup lemon juice, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, and salt and pepper to taste., Make sure the steaks get completely coated with the mixture on all sides. Add extra olive oil if necessary. When you're finished, cover the dish with plastic wrap.
 You can start the recipe in the morning and refrigerate during the day, or do it the night before and let the steaks marinate overnight. Turn the steaks halfway through to make sure both sides get completely marinated.

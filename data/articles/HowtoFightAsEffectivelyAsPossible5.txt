 Your toes pointed upwards works very well, too.
, Lean backwards(not as far as Neo in the Matrix), just out of range. While you are doing this, use the backwards momentum to swing a foot up and into your assailant's groin.
 One simply has to compress their forearm to their bicep(as close as possible, then swing it in a crescent motion so that their 'shield' meets the incoming missile. It is a variation of the 'cover block', my personal favorite style of blocking(at least for empty handed attacks). Quickly counterattack with a kick to the groin, punch to the solar plexus or chin, or a jab of the fingers to the throat, the eyes. If you take advantage of the situation, you can perform a take down.
 Pick your leg up(high-knees style), and swing your shin into their foot or shin. They do this in Muay Thai kickboxing. It can be painful, but not as painful as a shin or foot in your kidney or kneecap.

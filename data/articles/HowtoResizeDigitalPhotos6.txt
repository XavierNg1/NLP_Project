 Since Instagram uploads take place entirely on your mobile device, it is much more convenient to edit the photos that you take directly on your phone. There are multiple apps available that can resize your photos so that Instagram does not crop them.


If you want to resize a photo on your computer before uploading it to Instagram, resize it to 612 X 612 pixels. This is the size of the Instagram format.
 Depending on the app, the features may change. Most will allow you to resize your image so that it fits, and others will allow you to crop your existing image so that the cropped section fits into Instagram.
 Open your Instagram app and browse for your newly resized image. Upload as you normally would and you wonâ€™t lose any part of the image due to cropping.

 Many synthesis and replacement (single and double) reactions are exothermic, meaning they release heat. Reactions that release a lot of heat, such as the thermite reaction, can be explosive.The thermite reaction is a single-replacement reaction between iron (III) oxide and aluminum.
 Again, in many synthesis and replacement (single and double) reactions a precipitate will form at the bottom of the tube. A precipitate is any solid material that is insoluble in water.Sodium chloride is the white powder formed when molten sodium burns in chlorine gas.
 Most decomposition reactions are endothermic meaning you need to add heat for the reaction to occur. If heat must be added, you may be observing a decomposition reaction.An example of a decomposition reaction is mercury (II) oxide decomposing into mercury metal and oxygen gas in the presence of heat.
 Combustion reactions tend to explode, forming large amounts of light and heat energy. Oftentimes, this energy is released as fire. Combustion reactions are always exothermic, meaning they release heat.Some examples of combustion reactions are: hydrogen with oxygen, phosphorous with oxygen, and magnesium with oxygen.

 A 45-minute session making art using sculpting clay, among other media, helps create measurable reductions in stress.Take an hour or so when you’re feeling stressed to sit down with clay and some sculpting tools.


If you don’t know what to sculpt, try creating a sculpture depicting your stress or emotions. It can be realistic or abstract, whatever you feel is right.
Remind yourself that it’s not about what the sculpture looks like at the end of your session. The important thing is to engage in the creative process and turn your mind away from its stress.
 Drawing in the sand shares the same principles as a zen garden, particularly those pertaining to clearing the mind. Simply use your finger or a stick and a patch of sand for stress relief on-the-go.Do not focus on creating an elaborate or intricate drawing. Instead, work on one sketch until you are content with it, then wipe it away and start on something new.
Sand drawing can be as simple as you want. You are free to create anything from elaborate scenes to abstract shapes to stick figures.
 Use a sketchbook or journal to create a book filled with images and mementos of people, places, and things that can help calm you when you’re stressed. Think about people and things of significance in your life that help you feel calm, and paste pictures or reminders of them into your book.Not only will creating your book help you de-stress, you can also use your book whenever you get overly stressed to help calm you and remind you of people and things you love.

 Ensure the water is not too hot, as hot water may cause your plant’s colors to run. If the plant is considerably dirty, you can add a teaspoon of mild liquid detergent., This is especially important if your plant has a deep pot, or simply parts around its base that shouldn’t get wet. Wrap the bag around the plant’s base, then use adhesive tape to secure it., This should be enough to dislodge everything but the most tenacious dirt. Make sure to submerge as much of the plant as possible to clean it evenly.
 Keeping the plant submerged, dampen a cloth to rub tougher buildups of dirt and grime. Should these spots prove particularly difficult, you can add a mild detergent to your cloth before rubbing. Clean carefully, especially with more fragile plants.
 It’s especially important to rinse your plant if you used detergent. A shower head or kitchen spray nozzle works particularly well for this step.Dry your plant by first wiping off excess water with a clean cloth, then setting the plant out to air dry.

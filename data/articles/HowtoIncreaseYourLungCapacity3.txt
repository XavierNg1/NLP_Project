 Your lungs will respond to training, so get some resistance training in your routine and watch your lung capacity increase.Breathe in normally through your nose. Take deep breaths. Breathe out through your mouth with your lips still close together. Open them just slightly so a little bit of air can get out, and with resistance. Try to do this as often as possible. It makes the sacs in your lungs more used to having to hold air longer, stretching them out.
 Your brain, of course, looks out for the safety of your body, and is averse to stretching the body's limits. But the body can do amazing things when the brain is persuaded that everything is okay. Make sure you try this.


For eight counts, breathe until your lungs are totally full. After each count you should be able to breathe in more.
For the next eight to sixteen counts, take small sips of air. Feel your belly expanding. You shouldn't feel your shoulders moving.
Hold your breath for a few seconds and release forcefully.
After you feel "empty," make a "tssssss" sound for as long as possible. (This is called tizzling, and it mimics the resistance of playing a wind instrument.)
Practice this periodically. When you train your brain to stretch the body's limits, your breathing intake will spike.
 Playing a wind instrument is a great way to give your lungs a regular workout and have fun making music in the balance.


Learn how to play a woodwind or brass instrument such as a bassoon, tuba, trumpet, trombone, oboe, clarinet, saxophone, or flute. This activity will help you control breathing and expand your lung capacity to utilize all the alveoli.
Play in a marching band or a Drum and Bugle Corps. This activity requires more and more lung capacity utilization for your movement and playing and is quite healthy.
You can also learn how to sing. Singing really works the diaphragm, and can aid in continuous breathing exercises. Singers, of course, need to have really strong lungs.

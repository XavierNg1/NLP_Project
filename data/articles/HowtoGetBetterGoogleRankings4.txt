 Once you have launched a new product or a service, promote it efficiently on the social media networks. You can also ask them to provide their own photos by using the service or the product in an innovative way. This will not only enhance your promotion, but also create an interesting content for your site as people will be more interested to visit the page due to your participation and voting procedures, and viewers will most likely share the directories on their profiles.
 Once you receive these photos from the customers, upload them to your company’s Flickr or Pinterest account. As people love to win things, you can also arrange a voting system or poll, which can create a sheer interest among the audience and will also increase the shares and promotion of the content.
 After uploading and creating a voting system, enable Google reverse image search for people to find you through other websites that use your images. You can also ask them to link back the citations or credit you with the site’s link.

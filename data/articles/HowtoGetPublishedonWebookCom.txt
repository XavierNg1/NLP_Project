 Writers like feedback.
 Click on any "Start Your Project" links and buttons to begin. Give your project a title, write a short teaser, and then provide a more detailed overview.
 Will it be fiction or non-fiction, a collection (i.e. a collection of short stories), or a continuous work (i.e. a novel arranged into chapters)? Choosing appropriate topics and adding good keywords will help other interested writers and reviewers find your project later on, giving you wider exposure and readership.
 Your book will get more readers and better feedback if you use a good picture, as it makes the book more appealing and realistic.
 If you want to write the book by yourself, but you want feedback from the community, click "All members" under Participants and "I will be the only writer" under Writers.
 Invite other writers to contribute; this is all about collaboration.
 The best way to get more participants and feedback for your work is to be an active member of the community, offering great feedback to others.
 Read writing tips and invite a helpful feedbacker to trade writing advice. Revise your work. Find readers to give feedback on finished manuscript. Create a revision plan, finish the book, copyedit, and proofread it.
 Collaboration doesn't stop at the creation process. Getting books published anywhere depends on the wisdom of the crowd, who read, vet, and vote on what it deems the best finished work on the site. The publishing company will review the votes, make final selections, and solidify a publishing plan with the winning authors of the selected projects.

 In order to understand why hugging is probably not the best way to exhibit love to your dog, think about what hugs mean in the dog world. When dogs greet, play, or cuddle with one another, they do all sorts of things, but they almost certainly don’t hug in the way that humans do. On the contrary, the closest move in the canine world to a hug—what’s called ‘standing behavior,’ or placing a leg over the shoulders of another dog—signifies a bullying or dominating behavior.Even if your dog doesn’t perceive your hugs in the way that it would from another dog, they could be uncomfortable with it for other reasons. Some experts point out that dogs rely on speed and flight as their escape from danger, so a hug—which naturally arrests or immobilizes them—can seem like a threat or at least a source of anxiety., You might object to the idea that your dog doesn’t actually like hugs because you think it means they don’t love you. Remember, though, that hugs simply don’t mean the same thing to dogs that they do to humans, so their distaste for hugs has nothing to do with their feelings for you as a companion, friend, and family member., As you probably already know, dogs are very affectionate animals. They love to receive and give love through physical contact, just not necessarily in the same way that humans do. Instead of hugging, give your dog a belly rub, scratch their ears, or massage their shoulders and back.If you let your dog sleep on the bed, let them snuggle up at bedtime! Many dogs will be comfortable with close, sustained contact during sleep that they wouldn’t tolerate in other situations.

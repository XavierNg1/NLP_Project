 Do this in private to avoid embarrassing him. Explain that you're only interested in being friends and that you don't want to hurt his feelings. Talking to him will help him realize the truth. Don't give any hope of a romantic relationship in the future.Say something like, “You're really sweet, but I don't want to ruin our friendship. Let's keep it platonic.”
Talk to him in person. Don't hide behind a text message or computer screen.
Tell him yourself. Asking your friends to relay the message only will make everyone feel awkward.;
, Avoid being rude or hurtful, even if he repulses you. If you have to work with him or go to school with him, that could make things worse for you. Simply say, “Hi” when you pass each other and keep walking. Limit your facial expressions to a slight smile. If you have to talk to him for a group project, focus on the task at hand., This will totally defeat your goal of letting him know you don't like him. Don't play with your hair or make too much eye contact. These actions draw too much attention to yourself. Avoid standing or sitting too close or playfully stroking his hand. This could send the wrong message.

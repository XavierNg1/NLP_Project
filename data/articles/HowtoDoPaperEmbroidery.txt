 It has to be a picture you wouldn't mind throwing away once you are done with it and it has to be a physical picture, like a printed or photocopied piece.;
, The colors would have to match the color of the item it is outlining.
 Then take the template to put over that. Hold them in place with either staples - if the embroidery is smaller than the space being used and you don't mind the holes left behind - or paperclips. Paperclips can hold the paper in place, but be careful that you don't slide the paper on accident.
 Make sure that there is an ample amount of room between the holes and that you punch out outlines in even numbers. The former would prevent tearing, and the latter makes sure that each hole has a pair so that the thread always ends up clean on the top.
, Start by going through the back side of the paper and reach over to the hole's pair. Continue on until the line is finished.
 This can be done multiple ways. The thread can be cut off the needle and tied like shoelaces. Or, the thread can be taken into a loop and tied before the threadÂ is cut off the needle.
, If the picture was done on a card or other craft project, do with it accordingly.

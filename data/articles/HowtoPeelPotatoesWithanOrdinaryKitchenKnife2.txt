 Make sure that the length of the potato is parallel to the edge of the countertop.
 The slice should be no more than 1/4‚Äù (6 mm) thick, and the slice should be cut at a 90-degree angle. Slicing off the bottom of the potato will enable the potato to be placed upright on the cutting board without requiring any stabilization.
 Hold the rounded top of the potato with your non-dominant hand.
 Start at the top of the potato and peel off the skin until your knife reaches the bottom of the potato. Try not to take off too much of the white flesh of the potato as you peel.
 Continue peeling until all of the brown peel has been removed.
 Repeat the peeling process until all of your potatoes are peeled. Then, prepare the potatoes according to your recipe.

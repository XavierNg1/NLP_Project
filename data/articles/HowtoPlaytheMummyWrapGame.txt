 The aim of the game is to wrap up a friend like a mummy using a roll of toilet paper. You can play it with your friends or with an adult.;
, Then wrap up the mummy until he's totally covered. Start at the bottom, and work your way up. Go slowly, as toilet paper breaks easily. If your roll breaks, just tie it together again, and keep wrapping higher and higher. Make sure you leave room for his eyes, nose and mouth. When he's totally wrapped up, you can have loads of fun making him walk around and groaning like a mummy. The more the mummy moves, the more the toilet paper will fall off. When this happens, just start again with a different person being the mummy.
 One way to play which is loads of fun is to find an adult with a sense of humor, and wrap them up. It will take longer, as adults are often enormous, but keep wrapping until they totally covered. Make sure you leave room for his eyes, nose and mouth. Once your adult is completely wrapped up, dance around him to wake the mummy. Now run away or he'll catch you!

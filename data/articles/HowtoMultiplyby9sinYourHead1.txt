 The formula is 9x=10x−x{\displaystyle 9x=10x-x}. This method works for 9 times any number. In this instance, identify the factor you are multiplying by 9 as x{\displaystyle x}.
 Multiplying a number by 10 is easy to do in your head. All you need to do is add a zero to the end of the number.

For example:9(115)=10(115)−115{\displaystyle 9(115)=10(115)-115}9(115)=1150−115{\displaystyle 9(115)=1150-115}


, This will give you the product of 9x{\displaystyle 9x}.For example, 9(115)=1150−115=1035{\displaystyle 9(115)=1150-115=1035}.

 The style should be more 18th Century than modern day, with long sleeves and a ruffle collar and cuffs. Tuck the shirt into the trousers.;
, Stitch gold piping down the length of the outside seam, imitating formal military dress. Or, you could try black leather trousers, or silver spandex, or wet look leggings.
 These can be either lace up or pull on. Feel free to tie a gold scarf or ribbon around the top of one - RE the Stand And Deliver music video.
 Wear one or two (if two, one can be studded). Tie square scarves to one side of the belt, in either red, white or black.
 These can be very hard to find, and are usually expensive, but it is possible to get copies, or low quality versions from fancy dress, or second hand shops (Adam Ant's own "Prince Charming" jacket was on long term loan).
 Wear one small, gold hooped earring, in the left ear, with a skull shaped charm hanging from it. Wear silver chains of various lengths around the neck, with crosses and skulls ect hanging from them.
 Wear a fluffy white feather in the brim on the hat.
 Wear a wide, baby blue plastic belt around your waist.
, This is easy to replicate with a wash-in-wash-out hair dye, and a small size curling iron. You can get Adam Ant style wigs, but these are often horrible quality.
, For the iconic Adam Ant look, use good quality, pure white face paint, to draw a stripe across your face, from the top of one cheekbone, across your nose, to the other. Use black eye liner to outline the eyes and no not smudge it. The line should be stark, right around with a slight flick at the inner and outer corners. Use the same eyeliner to draw lines, starting in the hollow between your cheekbone and jaw, and fading inwards to just above the mouth, on either side of your face. Optional - use a touch of purple eye shadow on your eyelids, and a little clear, or peach colored lip gloss.

 The backbone — or spine — is a long central series of bones that run in a straight line from your dog’s neck to their tail. If you rub your hand along your dog’s back, you should be able to feel their spine. But if your dog is obese, their spine will be layered with fat, and not readily detectable., Your dog’s ribs, like their backbone, should be easy to detect with light touch. If you drag your hand gently across your dog’s flank, you should be able to feel several long bones running vertically up the dog’s side. These are your dog’s ribs. If you cannot feel the ribs without pushing into your dog’s flesh, your dog is obese., View your dog from above. Your dog’s body should taper inward slightly toward a point near their back legs before widening out at the rump. If your dog’s body, as viewed from above, is one consistent width from front to back, or if your dog’s body gets even wider as it proceeds from front to back, your dog is obese.

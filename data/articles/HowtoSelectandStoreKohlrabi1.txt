 Kohlrabi is at its peak from mid spring until mid fall., Look for kohlrabi bulbs that are approximately 3‚Äù in diameter, about the size of a tennis ball. The smaller bulbs are sweeter and more tender. Their taste is similar to peeled broccoli stems.Avoid larger bulbs as their taste will be sharper and more woody. They also have a thicker peel.
 Look for a kohlrabi bulb that has even skin without cracks or bruises., If buying a whole kohlrabi, with the leaves attached, opt for leaves that are dark green in color and firm to the touch. Kohlrabi plants with the leaves attached are often more fresh than the bulbs that have had their leaves removed.Avoid yellow or wilting leaves.
 While it is important to pay attention to the color of the leaves, the color of the bulb is less important. Kohlrabi bulbs can be white, green, crimson or purple. Once peeled, the inside of kohlrabi is always a pale yellow., The perfect kohlrabi bulb should be heavy and firm.

 An open D chord is bright, high-pitched, and expansive. It is one of the most commonly used chords, and works well with other common open chords like E, A, and G.


Remember that frets count from the head down. If you're right-handed, the first fret is all the way to your left.;
, Remember that the strings count from the bottom up, so the thinnest string is the 1st and the thickest is the 6th. Place you index finger down on the 2nd fret, 3rd string.
 Your two fingers will be diagonal to each other.
 When you're done, you should have a triangle shape across the bottom three strings. This is your finished D chord!

, Ignore the top two thickest strings on the guitar -- they are not used for the chord and will muck up the sound.
 This simply three-fingered shape can be slide up and down the bottom three strings to make more chords. Practice playing moving up and down the neck, searching out other chords.


Note: Your ring finger determines the root of the chord. If it is on a B, then the chord is a B.

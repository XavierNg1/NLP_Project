 Crack your eggs over a mixing bowl. Add your water. Beat the two together until they are evenly mixed., Pour your panko into a second bowl. Add your salt and pepper. Then zest your lemons in. Stir to combine., First, dip your blossoms in your egg mixture. Let some of the extra egg drip back into the bowl before moving on to the dry ingredients. Toss them around in the panko mixture to coat them evenly. Stir the panko up again every now and then, since the dry ingredients may separate. Set your breaded blossoms aside for now on a plate., Coat the bottom with olive oil. Keep adding oil until it’s roughly an eighth of an inch thick (0.3 cm). Set the burner to medium heat. To test when it’s ready, toss in a couple pieces of panko, which should begin sizzling right away., Add your dandelions to the hot oil. Wait about 2 minutes for them to turn golden brown on one side. Flip them over and cook the other side for another minute or so until they do the same., Line a clean plate with paper towels. Transfer your dandelions to the plate so the towels can soak up some of the extra oil. Use your leftover lemons to drizzle a little juice over them, then serve.

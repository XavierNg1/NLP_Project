 Daylilies also have edible tubers which are located in the root of the plant. Use a small garden shovel to dig up the root of the daylily plant. This can be done any time between late fall and early spring.It is best not to harvest daylily tubers during the summer when the plant is in bloom. This is because the tubers will become mushy in texture.
 The root of a daylily consists of spindly roots and tubers that look like small fingerling potatoes. The tubers will range in size from the size of a pea to the size of a large almond. Using garden clippers, cut most of the tubers from the root., Digging up the plant and removing tubers from the roots does not kill the plant. In fact, you can replant the remaining roots and tubers so that the daylily will continue to grow and bloom in the spring. This way you can harvest the same plant for multiple seasons., Once you have harvested the tubers, wash and scrub them with warm water to remove any dirt. Store them in a cool and dark place similar to potatoes. The tubers should be firm when you eat them, so make sure you feel the tubers before cooking with them. If they have gone mushy, you should discard them and harvest a new batch.

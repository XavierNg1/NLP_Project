 If you are present at the arrest, tell your friend to use his or her phone call to contact a lawyer. If your friend used the call to contact you, you can assist in finding a lawyer. Contact your local bar association and ask for a referral.


You should speak with an attorney who has at least 3 to 5 years of criminal defense experience.
Find someone who can go speak with your friend in jail.
 Your friend has the right to have a lawyer represent him or her even if the friend cannot afford one.You can tell your friend that the judge assigned to the case will appoint a public defender.


This means the friend should still wait for a public defender before speaking to the police. The friend will not receive a public defender until the arraignment (the first appearance in front of the judge) in most cases.
 Tell your friend that all conversations with his or her lawyer are confidential. Your friendâ€™s lawyer cannot share any information that your friend tells them with outside parties. After hearing the relevant details, the lawyer will offer advice for the best course of action.

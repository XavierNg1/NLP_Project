 Battling a lot of trainers could win you some cash, especially from the Socialites, Ladies and Rich Boys. Use the Amulet Coin which you can get in Castelia City from a man in the building on the left of the northern road.;
, You could find lots of treasures in caves and grasslands like Nuggets, Rare Bones and so much more. There's a gentleman in Icirrus City's Pokémon Center who gives a lot of money more than what the Pokémon Center shopkeepers give for treasures like Nuggets, Big Nuggets and Pearls.


In Undella Town a rich person gives lots for rare antiques. Sadly, the treasures require the Dive HM, which is obtainable only after completing the game.
 Buy a dozen of Casteliacones and go to Route 5 which is to west of Nimbasa City. Inside the trailer, there'll be a maid who'll sniff the Casteliacones in your bag and ask you to sell them; she'll give 2000 for one cone! You can get a lot of money daily this way.

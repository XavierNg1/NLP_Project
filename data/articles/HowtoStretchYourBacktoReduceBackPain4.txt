 If you're on your back, turn of on your stomach. Your legs should be straight out behind you., Your palms should be flat on the floor next to or just under your shoulders. Your elbows should be up in the air., Push just the top half of your body off the floor. It's sort of like doing a sit-up, but you're just curving your upper body into the air, not pushing your lower half up., Hold this position for about 30 seconds, then go back down to the floor. Repeat 3-5 times, or more if you prefer. You can this exercise several times throughout the day.

 Getting engaged is a two person decision. Have you and your partner discussed the idea? If not, now is the time. Ask your partner to have a talk with you.Pick a good time and place. Don't abruptly bring it up when your partner is leaving for work. Instead, find a time when you are both relaxed and at ease.
Find a good conversation opener. Try, "I've been thinking about what the future holds for our relationship. Do you have some time to talk about where we're headed?"
Make sure that you avoid asking, "Is this relationship going anywhere?"

, Be thoughtful about what you want to say and how to say it. Try to use "I" statements, such as "I feel that we are ready to talk about getting engaged." You should also try to make your points clearly and directly.Say what you mean. You might say, "The thought of getting engaged makes me both nervous and excited."
Actively listen to your partner. Indicate that you are listening by maintaining eye contact and paraphrasing your partner's statements. You can also ask questions to show that you are interested in their views.
 You may be feeling overwhelmed after your time spent reflecting. Be patient with yourself as you make your decision. You might also want to give yourself a break from thinking about it.Go see a funny movie or read a good book. You could even go on a weekend getaway with your friends.
Give yourself permission to process your emotions. Whatever you are feeling is ok.
 Once you have processed all of your thoughts and feelings, you're ready to make your choice. Are you ready to get engaged? Only you know the answer to that. But once you've examined your own feelings and talked to your partner, you should be in a much better position to answer that question. You can now confidently decide whether to get engaged, stick with the status quo, or go for a fresh start.

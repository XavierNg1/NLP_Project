 Made with pieces of wood joined together, butcher block offers a variety of economical, kitchen countertop options. Get a custom piece from a cabinet maker or browse standard sizes at home retailers, like Ikea, Menards or Lumber Liquidators. Because butcher block is wood, you can cut it to size yourself or ask the store to do it for you.Do not use butcher block immediately around a sink. Use it on islands and around appliances.
Make sure you oil the wood at least every six months.
 Cheap probably doesn’t come to mind when you think about stainless steel, but a stainless steel worktable is cheaper than a custom built island. Look for one at restaurant supply stores or online.
 You may be able to find solid acrylic countertops cheaper at a discount wholesaler, but it will still be a pricier option. Opt for an eighth of an inch veneer to put on top of unfinished countertops instead. You’ll find many kinds of SSV at your local home store and you can get the look and feel of solid pieces at a fraction of the price.

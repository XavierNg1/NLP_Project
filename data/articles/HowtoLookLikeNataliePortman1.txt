 Natalie Portman has flawless skin.

To achieve and maintain a Portman-esque complexion, consider adding the following steps to your skincare routine:

Cleanse and moisturize your skin after you wake up and before you go to bed. Natalie uses an alcohol-free moisturizer and never goes to bed with makeup on.
Use organic beauty and skin care products. These natural products are gentle on your delicate skin.
Exfoliate your skin regularly.
Wear sunscreen when you are outdoors.;

For daytime events, Natalie always opts to present the most natural version of herself. She achieves this by wearing the least amount of makeup possible.You can emulate her look by:

Applying a primer, foundation, and concealer that provides full coverage and brightens your face to create a flawless complexion.
Applying a small amount of blush to the apples of your cheeks and sweeping the product back towards your ears to add a flush to your cheeks.
Applying a generous amount of mascara to add volume and length to your lashes.
Applying a light coat of pink lip gloss to glam up your look.,

When attending evening events, Natalie prefers to present a “heightened version of her natural herself.”She usually chooses one feature to enhance with makeup, such as her eyes or her lips, and applies a minimal amount of makeup to the rest of her face. For example:

If she applies eyeliner and shadow to create a smoky eye, she keeps her lipstick simple.
If she wears red lipstick, she keeps her eye makeup to a minimum.Often, she coats her eyelashes with vaseline and wears more mascara in the evening.,

Natalie has recently become a fan adding a pop of eye catching color to her looks, such as red. When she wears red lipstick, she lets the color serve as her primary accessory, keeping her makeup and jewelry to a minimum. Instead of red lipstick, she occasionally paints her nails red.

 For this type of ink, you will use baking soda for writing and grape juice to reveal the hidden message. To do this, you will need ¼ cup of water, ¼ of baking soda, Q-tips, grape juice concentrate, and a paintbrush/sponge brush.All of these items should be found around the house or purchased at the grocery store.
 Pour the baking soda into the water and stir until it is fully dissolved. The baking soda will dissolve faster if you use warm water. This solution will serve as the invisible ink for your secret messages.The exact amounts of baking soda aren’t important as long as you have equal amounts of baking soda and water.
 Dip the Q-tip into the baking soda solution until the tip is damp. As you write, you will need to dip the Q-tip into the solution again to make sure you have enough ink. It can be hard to see what you’re writing because the ink is invisible.While the ink is still wet you can see it if you are working in a well-lit room.
 The ink must dry completely before you try to reveal it or the reaction will not work. Put your papers off to the side and write more messages while the first ones dry. The ink shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes to dry.When the ink is fully dry, you won’t be able to see anything on the paper. It will look like a normal blank sheet of paper.
 Once the writing has dried completely, you can reveal your message. To do this, dip a paintbrush in grape juice and brush it across the message. When the message is covered in grape juice, the writing will change color and you will be able to read what is written. This works because grape juice is acidic and reacts with the baking soda in the invisible ink to change color.Avoid getting the grape juice on your clothes because it can stain.

If the missed homework is for a class late in the day, you might be able to do the work before school, during another class, or during lunch or a break.
You can hand in the wrong assignment—such as one from another class—or an old one from the same class. By the time your teacher notices the mistake, you will be able to complete the real homework, or just turn it in the next day and say you are sorry about the mix-up.
Copy answers from a friend so you have something to turn in. Make sure your friend is ok with helping. This also only works for assignments where it is expected that students will have the same or similar answers. In some schools, even copying something like homework can merit a suspension. Remember to evaluate the situation and make a good decision as to whether or not you will copy homework off of a peer.
 Know that in many cases, you’ll need a written excuse from a doctor or clinic to prove to your teacher that you had to seek medical care, and weren’t able to complete your homework.



A dangerous move, you can forge a note from a parent explaining why you couldn't do your homework.
If you decide to forge one, be warned that your teacher might know it’s a fake. If you are caught, you face punishment from both your parents and teacher.

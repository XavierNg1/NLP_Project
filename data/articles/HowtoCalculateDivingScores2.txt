 In synchronized diving events, a separate panel of judges scores each diver's execution. These scores are based on the diver's form during take-off, dive, and entry. This score is not (yet) adjusted for difficulty of the dive or how well the two divers synchronized.


Depending on the event, there may be three scores for each diver, or two.
Example: Diver A receives execution scores of 7.0, 7.0, and 8.0. Diver B receives 7.5, 7.5, and 7.5.
 In order to reduce the effect of bias or unusual decisions, some of the highest and lowest scores are discarded. This depends on how many judges are at the event:



11 judges (3 execution scores per diver): Cross out Diver A's highest and lowest score. Cross out Diver B's highest and lowest score.

9 judges (2 execution scores per diver): Cross out the highest score and lowest score of the four, no matter which diver(s) they belong to.
Example: Since there are three scores each, cross out the highest and lowest scores for each diver: 7.0, 7.0, 8.0 and 7.5, 7.5, 7.5.
 An additional five judges each award a score for synchronization, or how well the divers coordinate during take-off, dive, and entry.


Example: the same divers received synchronization scores of 6.0, 6.5, 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5.
 Unlike the execution scores, this system is used for both 11-judge and 9-judge events.


Example: Ignore the lowest and highest results: 6.0, 6.5, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5


, Add together both divers' execution scores, as well as the synchronized scores. Ignore all crossed-out results.


Example: Remaining scores are 7.0 (Diver A execution), 7.5 (Diver B execution), 6.5, 6.5, and 7.0 (synchronization). Add them together: 7+7.5+6.5+6.5+7=34.5.
 Each attempted dive has a difficulty rating assigned in advance according to specific rules. Even if the divers did not manage to complete the dive perfectly, their score is multiplied by this degree of difficulty.


Example: Let's say the attempted dive had a 2.6 degree of difficulty. Multiply your last result by this number: 34.5 x 2.6 = 89.7.
 To get the final score, multiply your answer by 0.6 (or 3/5).This makes up for the fact that synchronized divers receive 5 judge scores (after discarding outliers), while individual divers only receive 3. After this adjustment, scores from both types of events fall in the same range.


Example: Multiply 89.7 * 0.6 to get 53.82, the final score for that dive.
 Calculate the score for each attempt using the same process. As the event continues, add the scores for each dive from the same pair.

 Using the screwdriver, remove the watch face. You may be able to simply pop it from the watch using a dull kitchen knife too (depending upon the watch).
 Ensure there is nothing on the watch face that could puncture or compromise the photo once you mount it.
 Especially if the watch has not been cleaned in some time, youâ€™ll want to make sure its free of debris and dirt. Use either a soft cloth or jewelry cleaner (depending upon the type of watch).


If you plan to cover the watch face area with a material, now is a good time to do so. Adhere material with a hot glue gun or super strength glue (depending upon the watch).

 A team must understand how success will be measured in order to work towards it.
 Employees should be comfortable leaning on their peers for help when necessary. Instead of sending in a manager or supervisor to remediate, have colleagues work with each other to bring the individual's work to a higher level.
 Rewarding good performance with incentives such as gifts, extra time off or other gestures will go a long way in motivating team members.


Reward team members publicly. This will increase the meaning and value, and motivate others to achieve as well.

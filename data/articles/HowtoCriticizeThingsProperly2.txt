 And then it should be a little criticism, then a lot of praise then the biggest chunk load of criticism and end it off with a smart yet kind praise phrase. This way, the person will be happy.
 If the product was really just terrible, still encourage them like 'I'm pretty sure Britney Spears can do much better than that but the piece she did was just boring'. This will always help you been a better criticizer.
 Make sure it meets the certain requirements above. Also, don't contain any words like 'we' or 'everyone' as this criticism is only written and given off by you. Not anyone else because there are so many people in the world who can disagree with you. Ask some other people to check if it's okay, if it isn't make changes if it is, your on the go.

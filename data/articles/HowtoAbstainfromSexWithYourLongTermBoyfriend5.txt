 In certain cases, your doctor may believe that a course of abstinence is necessary for you to heal from a difficult birth, an abdominal wound or surgery, or a trauma.


If permanent abstinence (i.e. involuntary celibacy) is recommended by your doctor, or if a medical condition has made involuntary celibacy required, chances are you and your partner will need long-term support.Consider seeing a sex therapist in order to develop a plan for how to deal.It's possible that you and/or your partner will want to break-up as a result of the decision to become abstinent.Try to be understanding, and remember that now you will have room in your life for someone who is willing to be abstinent with you.
 Definitely communicate your doctor's instructions and your concerns to your partner. Be sure to inform your partner consistently and to include them in future discussions. This affects them, too.


If you and/or your partner finds they are having difficulty dealing with abstinence, consider seeing a professional sex therapist. This can be an opportunity to work on other facets of the relationship., Communicate challenges and concerns to your partner and to your doctor as they arise, and ask for clarification and explanation.
 Medical abstinence may or may not include oral, vaginal, or anal sex or any of the manifold options of non-penetrative sexual activity. Work around the doctor's orders.

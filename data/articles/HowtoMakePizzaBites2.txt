 Turn the oven to 425°F (218.3°C). Get out a regular muffin pan while the oven is preheating. Spray the muffin pan with non-stick baking spray., Take the pizza dough out of the refrigerator. Let it warm to room temperature on a floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out until it is thin. Use a cookie cutter or round glass to cut 24 circles out of the dough. Press each circle into an individual muffin cup.The circles should be slightly larger than the cups in the pan you’re using.
 Put one pepperoni into the bottom of each dough cup. Then spoon ½ to 1 tablespoon of pizza sauce on top of each pepperoni. Sprinkle the cheese blend over the sauce.Add extra, mini pepperonis on top of the cheese if you’d like.
 When finished, the dough should be golden brown. The cheese on top should be bubbling and melted. Allow them to cool and serve while warm.Cover the leftovers with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and leave them in the refrigerator for longer than a few days.

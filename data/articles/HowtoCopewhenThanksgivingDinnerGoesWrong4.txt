 Thanksgiving can be an emotionally difficult time. If you are on the receiving end of a hurtful comment from a family member during the holidays, it can be hard not to lose control. Take a minute to yourself to collect your thoughts, remind yourself of your self-worth and then talk to a trusted friend or partner about your experience.


If you are on the receiving end of a hurtful comment, take a time out from Thanksgiving and call a close friend. If you are the host, ask a close friend or family member to do your work while you take a short break.
If you donâ€™t feel safe, you can always leave the Thanksgiving dinner.If you are the host and are not feeling safe, you can always ask people to leave.
 Thanksgiving can also go poorly when people fail to respect boundaries. It is best to know your boundaries going into the Thanksgiving dinner. You may not want to talk about particular topics such as religion, politics, or a former partner. If a friend or family member brings up one of these topics, you can politely tell them that you do not want to talk about that topic. You can also suggest a different topic that you feel more comfortable talking about., If relationships are feeling tense at Thanksgiving this year, you might try an activity to foster gratitude amongst your guests. Put a bowl in the middle of the dinner table. Distribute pencils and small pieces of paper to your guests. Ask everyone to write down one thing for which they feel thankful in their lives. Tell them they are free to keep the gratitude note to themselves or to put it in the gratitude bowl. At the end of the evening, ask a volunteer to read a few of the gratitude notes that have been placed in the blow.
 If you miss a traditional part of your Thanksgiving meal, avoid making it into a big deal. You can always bring the tradition back next year. Relax and enjoy the rest of the meal.

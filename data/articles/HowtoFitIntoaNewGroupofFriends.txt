 This includes personal hygiene (brushing your teeth, showering etc), subtle makeup if you want to, and brushing and styling your hair. Make sure you put some effort into your wardrobe. Dress appropriately and try to dress similar to your group, while staying true to yourself.;
, It's not just about the way you look, 90% of it comes from your confidence and personality. Walk tall, always smile. Try laughing at jokes and seeming interested in what people are saying. Don't ignore them; it may come across as rude.
 Of course if you want to change, you have to change, but not all of you. Remember, no matter what you look like, there's only one you...so flaunt it!

, Look through current style and fashion magazines and put a completely eclectic new trend into practice.
 You're not going fit into a new group of friends if you are sitting at home all day!

, Remember, these people are not better than you in any way and you're not better than them. You are all equal, and there is no one or nothing stopping you, only yourself.
 They have their own jokes and hangout spots. Act like you've been there your whole life!

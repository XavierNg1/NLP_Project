, Do this several times before trying a larger fire. Never use firelighters or other accelerants to get your fire going because it may damage your chiminea permanently.
 If the flame comes out of the chimney, it is probably too big. In which case, don't add any more fuel. If you want to regulate the fire after it's been lit, you can use the lid to control the amount of air going up the chimney. Do be very careful not to touch the exterior of the chiminea as they get very hot and can burn you. It's best to use long heat proof gloves.
 Even cast iron chimineas can crack if you drop them.
 Never use water or any other coolant.

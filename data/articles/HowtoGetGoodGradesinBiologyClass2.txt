 While you are in class, you will need to be diligent about taking notes on important topics. Anything that the teacher writes on the board should be in your notes. Also, if you are told to write something down, do it. Never assume that you will remember important topics.Also take careful notes about assignments and tests, this will help you understand what the instructor is looking for.
 Biology is a complex subject, and the lectures can get very involved. Avoid the urge to use your phone or talk to the person beside you. Focus only on what the instructor is discussing.It is a good idea to record the lectures, but you must have your instructor’s permission ahead of time.
 Your instructor’s job is to help you learn. When you are struggling to understand something that they are teaching, speak up and ask them. You can even wait until office hours or after class if you are uncomfortable speaking in front of the class.For example, you might ask “Professor, how does a cell replicate?”

, Homework is given for two reasons. Either your instructor wants to grade it, or they want you to learn the material so they can grade you on similar concepts later. Both are important to your success in the class. Dedicate time every day after class to do your biology homework.

 Place the jack onto a clean, clutter-free, and LEVEL work surface prior to beginning any type of maintenance.
 Remove the center cover plate from the jack by gently pulling it straight upwards. The plate is simply pressed down onto the jack's frame, held in position by a supporting frame-pin that passes through the frame and a notch cut into the Plate.
 Open the release valve to allow the saddle to descend to its fully-down position.
 Periodically lubricate pivot points, axles, and hinges to insure safe and reliable performance of the unit, to prevent rust and corrosion, and assure that all wheels, casters, and pump assemblies move freely.
 Check the pump piston and ram for signs of rust or corrosion. Clean as needed with an oily cloth.



WARNING! Never use any type of abrasive material to clean the machined surfaces of the pump piston or the cylinder ram!

, Store the jack with the pump piston, cylinder ram, and saddle in the fully-down position. Open the release valve (not more than 1/2-turn). This will help prevent rust and corrosion on these critical surfaces.

 Lumbar supports are important to untrap nerves in your back. You need to add lumbar chair supports to all of your seats, including your car. You can use a seat wedge, a small pillow, or a rolled up towel positioned at your lower back., A natural way to relieve the pain and promote healing is by using an infrared heating pad on the affected area. These heating pads use infrared rays that go into your tissues and bones to improve circulation and promote healing.A typical session with an infrared heating pad is 30 minutes, followed by a rest period then a gentle massage. You can also do 30 minutes on one spot, then move the heating pad to a different place for 30 minutes at that angle. You can do this multiple times each day.
You can purchase these heating pads online or at drug stores.
 You can use your glutes, aka your buttock muscles, to support your spine and reduce nerve pain. Before you bend over or stand up when seated, squeeze your glutes. This helps stabilize your back and lessen abnormal movements that may cause more pain on your trapped nerve., If your trapped nerve is making it difficult to sleep, put a pillow between your knees when youâ€™re going to sleep. Lie on your side with the pillow resting between your knees. You should be able to find the neutral pelvic position which will reduce the pain.

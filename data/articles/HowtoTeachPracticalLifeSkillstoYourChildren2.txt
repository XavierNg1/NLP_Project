 It's important for children to be polite and respect others. You can start with the basics by teaching 'please', 'thank you', and 'excuse me'. Model good behavior for your young child to see. For example, when your toddler offers you a bite of their food, make a point of saying "thank you!"As your child grows and grasps the basics, work up to table manners and manners in public. For example, you can teach them to speak politely to siblings and even pets.
Reward good behavior and show you are pleased when your child is using his manners correctly.
 Once you've begun practicing the basics at home, you can help your child take their new skills out into the world. Although you clearly don't want your kids chatting up every person they meet on the street, you do want them to know how to speak clearly, kindly, and politely to people they don't know.For example, when you introduce your child to a new friend, you want them to be able to say, "Hello" or even "How are you?" without being fearful or too shy.
As your kids grow older, it's also important to teach them to be polite to people like sales clerks and servers at restaurants.
 As a parent, you want to set your child up for success. In order to succeed socially or academically, kids need to learn to have a proper conversation. With younger kids, you can begin by teaching them to ask questions. For example, teach them to ask a friend, "Would you like to come to my house to play?"As your kids grow, teach them that conversations require two active participants. You want your child to understand that listening to the other person is just as important as talking.
Don't forget the importance of body language. Teach your children not to roll their eyes or scowl when they are talking to others.

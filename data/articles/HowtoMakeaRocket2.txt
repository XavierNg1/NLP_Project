 The strip should be about three times as long as it is wide: suggested dimensions are 4.5 inches (11.43 cm) by 1.5 inches (3.81 cm)., Wind the strip near the end or point instead of at the center. Part of the strip should hang over the pencil point or dowel end.


Be sure to use a pencil or dowel slightly thicker than a drinking straw, but not much thicker.
 Tape lengthwise along the entire length of the strip.
 Tape up the nose cone so it holds its shape.
, Blow gently into the open end of the paper rocket. Listen for a rustle of air escaping along the side or nose cone and feel along the side seam and nose for a gentle stream of air. Tape over any leaks and test again until you can no longer detect any leakage.
 Because the paper rocket is narrow, you may want to cut attached pairs of fins that will be easier to tape onto the rocketâ€™s end than three or four separate fins.
 Be sure the straw extends far enough out of the rocket that you can grip it with your fingers.
 Your rocket will fly into the air, propelled by the force of your breath.


Always point the straw and rocket upward, not toward anybody when launching.
Vary how you build the rocket to see how the modifications affect its flight. Also, vary how sharply you exhale into the straw to see how it affects the distance your rocket flies.
A toy similar to the paper rocket consisted of a stick with a plastic cone attached to one end and a plastic parachute attached to the other. The parachute was folded over the stick, which was then inserted into a cardboard blow-tube. When blown into, the plastic cone would catch the air and launch the stick. When it reached maximum height, the stick would fall, deploying the parachute.

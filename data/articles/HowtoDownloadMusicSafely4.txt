 If you’re an Amazon Prime paid subscriber, you’ll also have the ability to download Amazon Prime playlists for offline playback, but only on mobile devices. If you’re using an iPhone or Android, launch the Amazon Music app.
On a computer, point your web browser to music.amazon.com.



Mobile: Tap the ≡ menu icon, expand “Music Store,” then select “Store Home.”
Computer: Click “Amazon Music Store” on the left side of the screen.
 Type a song, artist or playlist name into the search box (click the magnifying glass first on mobile devices). As you type, Amazon will return matches for your search. Choose the correct song or artist name from the search results.
 A pop-up will appear, asking you to confirm. Tap “Buy Song” (mobile) or “Confirm Purchase” (computer) if you want to proceed.


If you are an Amazon Prime subscriber with a mobile device, tap the song, artist or playlist name and select “Download.”

, The process is a little bit different depending on whether you’re using a mobile device or a computer.


Mobile: Tap “In Library,” then click the download link (an arrow facing downward). Once the download is complete, find it by tapping the ≡ menu, then selecting “Your Library.” You can download Amazon Prime music this way in addition to music you’ve purchased separately.
Computer: Click “Download your music now,” then select a location where the file should be saved. If you download an individual song, it will be in the .MP3 format. Albums will need to be unzipped.

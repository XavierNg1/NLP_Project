 Be close, but try to give yourself enough room to maneuver your hands. Let your hands fall forward. With your fingers pointing at a downward angle, slowly move your hands next to the dryer opening.
 Jet air dryers are motion activated, so air flow will start once your hand movement is detected. Try to make this movement swift. Sometimes, slower movements will not be detected.
 Be sure to lower both hands entirely. You want to make sure that the air surrounds your wrists and hands.
 Gently raise both hands upward until they are almost out of the air stream. Move them in a way that allows them to brush against the airflow.
 When the airflow hits your fingertips, place your hands back into the airflow. You want your hands to be thoroughly covered.
 Repeat these motions until your hands are completely dry. You may even want to turn your hands so that your palms are facing upwards. This will ensure that both sides of your hands are dry.


There is some concern that jet air or warm air dryers spread bacteria and germs.

, Most modern smartphones have this keyboard enabled automatically. You cannot use Facebook Messenger's built-in emoji menu, since Facebook has removed the middle finger character from it.



iPhone - Tap the Smiley button next to the spacebar. If you see a globe instead, tap this until the emoji keyboard appears. If you still can't access the emoji keyboard, see Get Emoji Icons on an iPhone for instructions.
Android - Tap the Smiley button next to the spacebar. If you don't see a Smiley button, you may need to install a keyboard that supports emoji. See Get Emoji on Android for details.

 This will insert the middle finger into your Facebook message or comment. Most people should be able to see it, but people with older devices that don't support newer Unicode characters will not see it properly.



On iPhone, you may be prompted to select the skin tone. If you pick anything other than default, only people with iPhones will be able to see it.

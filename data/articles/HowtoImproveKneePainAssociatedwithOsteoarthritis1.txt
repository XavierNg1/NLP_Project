 Research findings continue to support the notion of weight loss being linked to decreased cartilage loss in the medial tibia - a key cause of osteoarthritis. A study carried out by Australian researchers in February 2014found that with every 1% weight loss, there was a 1.2mm^3 decrease in the loss of medial tibial cartilage volume - subsequent studies might put this into question, however, so don't take it as a hard and fast rule.;

 Are there any cutbacks you can make, not only in terms of snacking between meals, but in switching to lower calorie versions of the spreads, drinks, and so on in your fridge. A diet doesn't have to be a complete denial of the foods that you love. It can just be a series of adjustments to the foods that you already eat. If you don't have a lot of weight to lose, that is.

 This doesn't mean getting to the gym and pumping iron for 3 hours a day. Exercising can just mean going on short walks more regularly - walking to the grocery store rather than driving or taking public transport, parking further away from a shopping precinct so you have to walk further to get to where you want.

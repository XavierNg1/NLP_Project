 With the napkin face-down in front of you, fold it in half horizontally and orient the open ends away from you.
 Fold the top-right corner down to the bottom center.
 Fold the bottom left corner up to the top center.
 Flip the napkin over so that the points of the triangle point down and up respectively.
 Fold the bottom edge straight up to the top. The down-facing point of the triangle on the left should remain.
 Carefully, untuck the point from the triangle on the right side.
 Lift the right point up to open the triangle.
 Take the corner on the far left and fold it in, creating a seam at the center of the bottom point.
 Fold the top corner of the triangle you opened back down.
 You should be able to see the bishop's hat beginning to form. There should now be two points at the top of the napkin formation and one point on the far right.
 Take the far right corner or point and pull it over to the left, tucking it into the pocket of the left triangle. This should make a seam at the center of the top triangle on the right.
 Prop up and enjoy your bishop's hat napkin fold!

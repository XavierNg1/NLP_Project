 Paint brushes, Canvas, paint, etc. Easels are good for holding canvases, and are strongly recommended. You can buy Easels that stand up, or sit on a table, depending on your likeliness.;
, Don't paint an apple, then paint the background! Start out with your background first, (blue for the sky.) And if you would like, add details (White clouds, and green grass.) Then, paint the red ball that will be your apple. After this, paint your green stem and any shine/shading on the object. Layers are VERY important, and you must think before you paint!

, You could even set up your object! just make sure it doesn't move too much, or your painting would be one big blob.
 Try to get the right tints. for example: If i was painting an apple, i would put a darker shade of red for shading. Mix the color your using for the base apple with a tiny bit of black to make the shade. blend it with the base red, and voila! your apple now has 2 different shades. See how many shades you can get for blending.
 This is a  very important step. Take a pencil and lightly tap a dot on the corner/side that the sun/light is coming from. Now, when you're painting, think of the dot as a flashlight. What does the light hit/does NOT hit? Paint the glow of the flash light where it would appear. Put shading where it does NOT appear.
 Using different sized paint brushes help if you are looking for detail, or a base coat. Use a larger brush for your background, and the small tipped brushes for detail.
 Don't start your very first painting and try the Mona Lisa!  Simple everyday items such as blocks, Bouncy balls, books,soap bars, silverware, fruit, and even candles!

, Painting skill doesn't just randomly appear one day! It takes time. Some times, 1 simple painting could take you 6 hours!

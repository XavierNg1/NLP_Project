 This can be anything from cereal and tissue boxes to toilet paper roles to plain flat squares.
 If you are afraid your rats will run off of this board, build a small fence. An alternative to a fence is to place your "buildings" around the edge to block any escape.
 Glue these buildings to the flat board.


Be sure the glue is non-toxic.






If you want to get fancy, place cardboard rectangles down to be "roads" to each building.
 As long as the materials you are using are non-toxic and your rats cannot chew them up, you can be as creative as you want.

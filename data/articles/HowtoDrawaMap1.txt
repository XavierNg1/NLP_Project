 A topological map just shows routes from one point to another. It ignores any scale or even the real-life positioning of the locations. Probably the best example is the London Underground map.;
, To draw a topological map, you need to draw a symbol for each location, and a bunch of lines connecting them together (representing the routes between them). You need to plan this out so that you don't end up with a mess of lines. Remember: the position of the objects on the map does not have to correspond to their real-life locations.
 Try sketching it in different ways. It will help you to see what you can change to make it better. Try making the routes different colours to make them stand out, use different symbols for different types of objects, etc.
 This is the version that you will use as the actual map. Try to make it as neat as possible.

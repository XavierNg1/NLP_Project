 The longer you put it off, the knowledge that teachers have given you will start to wear off and you'll forget important things. As soon as you're done, put your homework into their corresponding notebooks, binders, or folders. Print out anything that needs to be printed out and get all important papers signed.;
, If the backpack is not torn, battered, too dirty, or just not going to last you through until the next break, then consider keeping it so you can save more money. If you choose to buy a new backpack, buy a sturdy backpack with zippered pockets.
 If you just need a new glue stick or pencil set, don't completely refresh your supplies.
 A good time would be a few days before the term starts again. If your backpack is more disorganized, then start earlier. The best way to do it is to do it all in one shot, so you won't forget how you were organizing things and accidentally throw out papers.
 Slip them into a folder marked with the subject, teacher, course, and term. Keep all the important papers.
 If the paper is still in use, place it in your folder/binder. If not, throw it out or recycle it.
 This includes supplies (as in pencils, pens, erasers, etc.) and all binders, notebooks, or folders.
 This would be your binders and textbooks, if you bring them home. They should be placed closest to your back.
 These last two steps will keep your backpack feeling light on your back.
 If not, place them in a pencil case/supply box and put them on top of your folders.

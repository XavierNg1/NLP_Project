 Maybe you have a general question, such as “How can grafting be used on plants?” or “How did Lincoln influence the Civil War?” However, these are very broad. If you research these questions, you will end up with too much to read and a paper that isn’t focused. You have to narrow your topic down.
 Look at each part of your question, and consider how you can make it more specific.


For instance, with the “How can grafting be used on plants” question, ask yourself what kind of grafting you want to focus on. To what end? What kind of plants? If you answer those questions and others like it, you may end up with something more specific, for example “How can whip grafting be used to produce consistent Honeycrisp apple trees?”
If you have a humanities question, ask yourself similar questions. What issue in the Civil War do you want to focus on when considering Lincoln’s influence? Do you want to look at the overall outcome or how Lincoln influenced specific battles? What part of Lincoln’s influence do you want to look at? By answering those questions, you can end up with a more specific question: “How did Lincoln’s personal beliefs on slavery affect the Emancipation Proclamation?”

, You want something interesting that requires research, thinking, and the development of an argument.


For instance, something like “What is chlorophyll?” is can be answered with a simple search through the dictionary. Your topic should force you to actually do research.
 Despite wanting your question to be unique and interesting, don’t bite off more than you can chew. That is, don’t make your question too ambitious. You want to be able to answer it in the confines of a paper. In the same vein, you don’t want a question that is unanswerable. Through your research, make sure you will be able to draw some sort of conclusion through your arguments.

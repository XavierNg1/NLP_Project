 If you love art and doing hands on things, look for a high school that has lots of opportunities in art. If you're big into sports, look for a school with a good athletic program. You get the idea, right?;
, You can see your friends no matter what high school you go to, and even make new friends to introduce to the old! This is your decision not theirs.
 Ensure the fees are affordable for your family without having to make sacrifices. Fees usually only apply for private school; most public schools will charge minimal or no fees. If the fees are too high, try for a scholarship or financial aid. Scholarships are given to certain students but if you fill out a form for financial aid it's guaranteed!

, Remember - you have to spend the next four years of your life at this school. Be sure you want to go to this school, and that you have enough information to make that decision.
 If that school doesn't have as many clubs as another school don't rule it out. Or if one school has free laptops don't choose that school because of it. Or don't rule them out just because they do not have a certain class you want to take. Try to look at a school overall and not for one thing.
 What electives are there? How are the teachers? Do they have clubs? Good athletic programs? That's what tours are for. Remember step four- don't leave a tour wishing you asked something.
 Imagine how you would feel walking down the halls or in the cafeteria. If your comfortable and happy with many things about the school, then definitely make it an option. You want a school that's just right for four years.
 Make sure the whole family has agreed on the decision and everyone feels comfortable with the new enrollment.
, You can keep in touch with them, like texting, emailing, or calling each other once in a while. You can even hang out with them if you've got time.

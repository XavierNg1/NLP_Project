 Sprinkle Â½ teaspoon (2.5mL) plain gelatin powder into 1 tbsp (15mL) cold water. Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes, or until the liquid is slightly thick.All amounts given are for 1 cup (240mL) heavy cream. This expands to about 2 cups (480mL) after whipping.;
, Continue heating and stirring until all the gelatin dissolves, leaving no lumps behind. Do not let the liquid begin to boil.Try a double boiler, which will heat the gelatin slowly and evenly.
A microwave is the fastest, but a little risky. Heat at 10-second intervals only, to avoid overheating., Remove from heat and let the gelatin cool. Wait until it reaches roughly the temperature of your finger.Do not let it cool too far past this point, or the gelatin may set into a solid.
 Whisk until thick, but not yet able to form peaks., Whisk constantly while pouring in the gelatin. If you leave the gelatin sitting in the cold cream, it may set into strings of solid gelatin. Continue whisking the cream as usual.

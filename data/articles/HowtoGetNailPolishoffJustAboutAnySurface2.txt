 If you can, scrape off any excess nail polish from your clothes with a plastic putty knife or knife edge. You don't want to use a cloth to wipe if off because that will only worsen the stain.
 Perform a spot test before you use it, as nail polish remover can interact with some dyes and fabrics (it will actually melt acetate).








Choose a spot on the inside of the fabric as a test area.
 Pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol directly to the spill and blot it off with a clean cloth. Use firm, quick blots and be sure not to wipe the stain because it will spread the polish and push it deeper into the fabric.
 Baking soda is a great way to clean off nail polish and not damage your clothes. Dampen a clean cloth and dip it into baking soda. Then, gently blot away at the nail polish stain. Use firm and quick presses to blot.
 After using a cleaning agent to wash away a polish stain, clean the area with water to remove residue.








Put the clothes into the washing machine if you are able to do so, but you should always hand wash items that cannot be put into the washing machine by blotting the affected area with a clean cloth and warm water.

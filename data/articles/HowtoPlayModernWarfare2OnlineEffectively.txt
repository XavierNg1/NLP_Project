 Do they accompany each other? Or are they sort of the same type of weapon? (M4A1 and the PP2000 for Ex.) You want something that will accompany each other. Since you're running and gunning you'll probably want a Shotgun (Silencers are Highly not recommended on them)because you are close range and shotguns are the king of close quarters and a SMG. Why sacrifice the accuracy? Well you're running and gunning enemies and Close-Quarters. AR's will not have the speed (Expect for a F2000) to take down an enemy as quickly. As for example a P90. Good damage with high firerate. It can outgun a TAR-21 possibly.;
, Again does it accompany each other or do the same thing? For the Primary Grenades it is recommended to use Semtax. It has the most throwing range and detonates quickly. The Secondary Grenades are your choice. Try a FLASHBANG because if your about to clear a building, a flashbang will blind them. Giving you over 50% chance of clearing it out rather then just rushing in.


What are your perks? This is important because this greatly affects your type of strategy you're doing. Running And Gunning. So we're going to need Marathon obviously because your running at nearly all times. Lightweight or Stopping Power. Stopping power greatly increases chances of dropping an enemy a lot faster then they can. WARNING: You are at a disadvantage without Stopping Power as they may most-likely have it. Your pick though.
 know the map well enough to know where the enemy is coming from and where they will possibly spawn next and also what routes you can use to "Run and Gun"

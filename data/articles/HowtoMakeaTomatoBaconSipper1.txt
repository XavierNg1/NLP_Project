 Add 1 garlic clove, 5 fresh basil leaves, 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of lime juice, and ¼ teaspoon (1 g) celery salt to a cocktail shaker. Use a muddler to mash the mixture until it is fully mixed.If you don’t have a cocktail shaker, you can mix the ingredients in a large glass jar with a lid.
If you don’t have a muddler, a wooden spoon can also work well.;
, After you’ve finished mixing the lime juice mixture, add 2 ripe, medium, red heirloom tomatoes that have been cut in half to the cocktail shaker. Mash the tomatoes with the muddler until they are fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth.You can substitute your favorite tomato for the heirlooms if you prefer. Just make sure that they’re medium size.
 Once the tomato mixture is smooth, add 1 ½ ounces (44 ml) of vodka, 1 tablespoon (14 g) of pepper bacon that’s been cooked crisp and chopped, ½ teaspoon (2 ½ ml) of Asian chili sauce, and enough ice to fill the cocktail shaker. Cover it and shake the mixture well for 20 to 30 seconds.If you want to make a nonalcoholic version of the tomato bacon sipper, substitute lemon-flavored sparkling water for the vodka.
 When all of the ingredients are well blended, pour the mixture through a wire mesh strainer that’s placed over a measuring cup. Use the back of a spoon to press all of the juices from the tomato pieces, and throw away the solids., Once it’s strained, pour the mixture over ice in a glass. Garnish it with the tomato slices, bacon, and romaine leaf, and serve.If you like, you can run a lime wedge around the rim of your glass before filling it. Next, dip the rim of the glass in a mixture of celery salt and paprika for extra garnish.

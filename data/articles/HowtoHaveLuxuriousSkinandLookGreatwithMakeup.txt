 When you have a shower or bath,make sure to use a body wash all over to refresh and rinse off. After you get out,use a body lotion/butter/cream to keep your skin silky soft. Massage in until completely absorbed. Use an exfoliator once a week. Scrub gently then wash off to get rid of dead skin cells. Every morning and night,use a good quality wash or cream cleanser to get rid of any dirt on your face. A moisturizer afterward keeps your face hydrated too.;
, Just remember, don't overdo it! Here are some steps to apply make up like a pro.
 For blusher, smile and dust your blush with a fluffy brush on the rounded parts of your cheeks. Don't use too much to avoid looking pale and red cheeked. Now shine should be at bay and your cheeks rosy.
 Choose an eyeshadow colour, then sweep across your lid(carefully!)and no higher then your brow. Blend in well,either with an eyeshadow applicator,small brush or the tip of your finger. Keep in the lid. For eyeliner,gently line just the outer halves of your lower eyelids to make your eyes look bigger. Smudge carefully for a smokey look. When using your mascara,carefully brush through your lashes and allow to dry, as doing so repeatedly can cause smudges, clumps and spikes. One coat should be enough. If you prefer liquid eyeliner to pencils, then lean on one of your elbows and pull very gently at the edge of your eyelid. With the other hand, draw a fine line along the roots of your eyelashes. Allow make up to dry.
 Use sticks or just little pots. You can use lipsticks for dramatic,noticeable colour. Light pinks and browns are ideal. Paint carefully onto lips,not going over the edges. Or for a more subtle look,how about a lip gloss? These come in colours,with sparkles, flavoured or clear. Squeeze the tube and smooth onto lips for shine. If it is a lip gloss wand you have,paint onto lips just like you would with lipstick.

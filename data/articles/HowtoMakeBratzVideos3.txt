 Great! A great tip to use while filming is to hold your doll by her feet if it's a close-up. You can use the "pause" button on your camera if it has one, but sometimes as you watch over, it makes a weird clicking noise. It's silent, but it can be really annoying. Accidents can happen though. Let's say you already have two minutes of filming down and your hand shows. You have to delete it. It sucks, but that's called perfection.
 If your doll throws a ball of fire, you want people to see it. Right? Windows Movie Maker is good, but not really professional. Sony Vegas Pro is great, but expensive. Amazon.com sells hundred of editors for thirty dollars. You want the best for your show. Everything can't be free.
 This is just short. You may post it like, Bratz: Identical Secrets (Season One) Eps. 1 "Lies". You edit it, and then you post it. Not hard. But sometimes, it can take an hour to upload that twelve minute video. Maybe even more. But remember-not everyone can get nine hundred subscribers. Get the word out!

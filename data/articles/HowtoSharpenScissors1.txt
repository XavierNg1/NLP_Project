 A sandpaper sheet with 150-200 grit will work just fine, but you could even go for a little bit of a finer grit (bigger grit number) if you want smoother edges to your scissor blades. Fold the sandpaper in half, with the rough sides facing outward.


Have the rough edges face outward, so the sandpaper grazes against both blades as you cut the paper.;
, Cut through the sandpaper, cutting long strips, about 10-20 times.You will notice that the blades become sharper with every strip of sandpaper cut. Use full scissor strokes, beginning the cutting at the base of the scissors and extending to the tip.









Cutting through sandpaper is good for scissors that arenâ€™t horribly dull, but just need some touch up sharpening.
The sandpaper also helps smooth out nicks and indents on the blades.
Some alternative cutting materials to sharpen scissors are emery cloth and steel wool., Wipe down the blades of the scissors using a damp paper towel to clean off any sandpaper bits that may have collected on the blades while sharpening the scissors.

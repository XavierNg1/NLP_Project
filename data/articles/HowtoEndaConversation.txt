 Did you start it with a comment on something? Or did the person you're speaking to start it?;
, You don't want the other person thinking you're rude for blowing them off after YOU started the conversation, right?

, Pauses in between thoughts are good places to tell the person you have to be somewhere or have to get something done. Note: Pauses in between thoughts does not mean waiting for the person to simply finish a sentence or say "Um..." You really should wait until they finish a thought, out of courtesy.
 I'll talk to you later, bye."

, Saying you'll talk later is friendly, and most of the time, the person will have time to organize thoughts, so your follow-up conversation is shorter.
 Certain people will have no problem with letting you go for awhile, while others will wait for you to get to your car, your class, or even just the bathroom before insisting on texting you. Hopefully YOU know the people you're dealing with!

, Other people need to understand boundaries too, and cutting too much slack can make them think it's okay to monopolize your time. There are just some situations where manners have to be put aside.

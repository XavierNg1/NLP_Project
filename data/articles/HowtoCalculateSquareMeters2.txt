 Measure the length and width in feet and multiply them together to get a result in square feet. Since 1 square foot = 0.093 square meters, multiply your result by 0.093 to get the answer in square meters instead. Square meters are bigger than square feet, so it will take fewer of them to cover the same area.


For greater precision, multiply by 0.092903 instead.
 If you have the measurement in square yards, multiply by 0.84 to get the measurement in square meters.


For greater precision, multiply by 0.83613 instead.
 One acre contains about 4050 square meters. If you want to be more precise, multiply by 4046.9 instead.
 One square mile is much, much larger than a square meter, so typically it is converted into square kilometers instead. Multiply the square miles by 2.6 to find the area in square kilometers instead. (Or multiply by 2.59 instead to be more precise.)


If you really want to convert to square meters, 1 square kilometer = 1,000,000 square meters.
 Square meters are a unit that measures area, or two-dimensional surfaces. It doesn't make any sense to compare them with units that measure length, or distance in one direction. You can convert between "square meters" and "square feet," but not between "square meters" and "feet."


Don't use the calculations in this section to convert between units of length. That requires different numbers.

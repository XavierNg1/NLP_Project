 If you are working with multiple layers, only worry about the bottommost layer now. To create "floating" embeds, you'll be pouring your gel wax at different times.









Arrange your embeds around the bottom of your container. They should only move minimally when under the wax.
Have tweezers ready to adjust your embeds as necessary without burning yourself.
Use sand or salt to create a beach scene. Add seashells or pebbles for dynamics. Glue salt onto sticks to create white algae. Colored sand works well, too.
Petals or flowers add well to a color scheme in any room and combine easily with fragrance. However, natural embeds may require a gel coating before placed in the container of hot wax. This can be done with the same wax gel.
Wax pieces of fruit or ice cubes call to mind summery drinks and sunshine.
If you do buy gel wax premade, make sure it is high density if you are wishing to embed heavy objects.
 Take note: The faster you pour, the more bubbles there will be. And if you are working with layers of embeds or color, only pour enough to cover the first section.









Grab your tweezers to adjust your embeds if they've moved under the pressure.
If unwanted bubbles are starting to form on the top of your candle, grab a hair dryer to reheat the top, solving your problem!, Once your first layer has mostly cooled (this should only take a matter of minutes), create your second level of embeds on top of the wax and continue pouring.









If your wick is not tabbed, you may wish to take a careful hold of it while pouring.
Remember, you can add more color for a gradient effect!
Repeat this process for however many levels you desire.
 After about four hours, it should be ready. At this time, trim the wick to 1/4 of an inch (.63 cm) before burning.

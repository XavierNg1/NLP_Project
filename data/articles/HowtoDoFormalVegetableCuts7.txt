 Then, instead of being in batons or cubes like the Macedoine, cut the vegetables into thin slices.
This is an easier cut as its the least formal of the group. Its mostly used for a mirepoix (a base group of flavoursome vegetables such as onion, carrot and celery, or onion, celery and capsicum etc) used in stocks, soups, sauces and casseroles.

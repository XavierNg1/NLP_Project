 This is an emerging field in art. Using sophisticated software and modern computers, digital images can be created, stored, and transmitted with relative ease when compared to paintings. These images are used in a wide variety of fields, including:


Advertising. Products can be displayed with digital imaging techniques to draw the consumer's eye, helping to build a successful product marketing campaign with minimal field expense, such as travel, models, and location costs.
Illustration for publications. Many businesses depend on online marketing and printed brochures to show examples of their products or business offerings. Magazines use digital images to illustrate conceptual ideas where photography cannot successfully accomplish this task.
Film making. With the increase in special effects in movies continuing to push the threshold of where movie making can take us, often the only limit is the ability of the graphic digital artist to create realistic film elements.
, They may be looking for employees to work on projects, and besides drawing a "regular" paycheck, you will get a feel for the actual work required to succeed in this media field.

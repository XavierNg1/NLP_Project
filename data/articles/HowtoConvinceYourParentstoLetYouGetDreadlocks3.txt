 After you’ve figured out exactly why you want dreads, gather your thoughts and put them to paper. Then, you’ll be prepared to effectively make your case to your parents.
 You may be surprised that your parents don’t really know much about dreadlocks.


Tell them how dreadlocks are created.
Let them know whether you expect to style them yourself or go to a salon. Saying something like, “I’ve found this great hair shop that will style dreadlocks for a reasonable price,” lets your parents know you are serious and have done your research.
 If your parents are unfamiliar with the style, they may not know how easy they are to care for once you have them.


Bring a list of salons or hair shops in your area that specialize in dreadlocks. Your parents may be reassured knowing that your hair will be cared for properly.
Show them samples of shampoos or other styling products (wax) that you plan to use with your dreads.
 If your parents are really opposed to your dreadlocks, it will be easy to stray from that discussion and just argue with them.


Your argument will be strengthened if you only talk about your desire for dreadlocks, rather than focusing on other differences you may have with your parents.
Gently nudge your parents back to the topic if they stray away from it.
 It will be challenging not to get frustrated or upset if the discussion does not go well. However, if you remain as calm as possible, you will be perceived as more persuasive.


If the discussion becomes heated, suggest taking a 5-minute break. You could go for a short walk to calm down during this time.
A good strategy for calming your parents could be to thank them during this time for taking the time to discuss this with you.

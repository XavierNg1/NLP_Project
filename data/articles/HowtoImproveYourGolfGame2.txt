 A common misconception amongst golfers is that the harder they whack the ball, the further it will go. You should actually focus on the middle of the ball and the control you have over your swing. This will give you far better results than trying to increase the power of your swing. Hitting the ball too hard will invariably mean a slice or a fresh air shot., Try not to tense up before making the shot. Concentrate on controlling your swing, and the club will do the rest for you. Once you have mastered controlling your golf swing, you can then gradually increase the power you use when driving the ball.Instead of muscling the shot, use your left hand to control the club during the swing. Use your right hand if you’re left-handed.
 When taking your practice swings, imagine the shot you wish to hit. Picture the ball’s flight when you make your practice swing. Make sure your swing feels comfortable. This technique will relax your body as well as your mind. Also, never take too many practice swings, as the thought of fluffing the shot will build up in your mind and affect your confidence., Hit the drives with minimal spin on the ball. To achieve this, you can tee the ball up high. This will promote less spin on the ball as you will be hitting it from a more underneath position. Also, try to avoid moving forward over the ball on impact. This will always reduce spin., Consistency in the amount of times you get out there and play is crucial to a good game. To hone your golfing skills, you must play regularly. You will not improve if you don’t practice. You will learn to tweak your game a little bit more each time you play, and bring the lessons you learned the previous week to the course with you the following week.

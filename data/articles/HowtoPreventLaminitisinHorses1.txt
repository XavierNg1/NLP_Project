 Horses like to eat, and if they find a bag of oats left unattended, they will consume the entire bag, which could cause horse laminitis.


Use plastic storage bins with locking tops. This will keep horses, mice and other rodents out of the grain.
Keep the grain containers behind a closed door, such as in a tack room or storage shed. Preventing laminitis includes keeping horses safe from themselves.;

Green pasture grass contains high levels of starch and sugar, which may trigger horse laminitis. The starch and sugar content is highest in the spring and during the day.
In the spring, when lush grass starts growing tall, prevent equine laminitis by turning horses out for only a couple of hours, and gradually increase the amount of time they spend in the lush grass until they have become accustomed to the high starch and sugar diet.
Horses that have had issues with laminitis in the past are more likely to succumb to laminitis again, and should never be left to eat freely in a lush pasture.
Try turning your horses out at night when the starch and sugar content in the grass isn't as high. Preventing laminitis may mean changing horses' pasture schedules to protect them from consuming too much starch and sugar.
Feed a probiotic and prebiotic: Feed a balancer that contains both a prebiotic and a probiotic. This is a simple, yet very effective way of maintaining good gut health and aiding the digestion of fibre.
Avoid fructans: the level of fructan in grass can vary with the changing seasons. The spring and autumn growing seasons are when fructan is at its highest level. With our winters becoming milder and our summers becoming wetter, the growing season has become extended. Because of this, it is important to observe grass growth. Not only should you monitor the field that your horse is grazing, you should keep an eye on surrounding fields that are not grazed to get an idea of how fast the grass is growing and therefore how much your horse is eating.

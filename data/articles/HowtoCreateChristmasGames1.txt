, Have the members of each team stand in a single file line, with the first person in line wearing the gloves/mittens.
 If you're the first person in line, run to the bowl.
 You may only use your handsâ€”no teeth to unwrap the kiss.
 You may go as soon as you have the kiss in your mouth. Tag the first person in line. Then, take off the gloves/mittens and give them to the person you tagged.
 A group wins when everyone in the group has eaten a chocolate kiss!

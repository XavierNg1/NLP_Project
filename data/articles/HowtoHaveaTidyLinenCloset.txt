 It makes good common sense to keep the same items together in the linen closet. For example:


Put all the bed linen together. Some people prefer to put the sheet set together (fitted sheet, flat sheet, pillow cases) and keep it intact. Others prefer to separate into fitted sheet piles, flat sheet piles, pillowcase piles. It all depends on how fussed you are about mix and match, your personal preference, and what your space permits.
Put all the towels together. It is a good idea to separate into: bath towels, beach towels, bath sheets, hand towels,
Keep face washers in a small basket or container. This makes them much easier to contain and find.
Keep tea-towels in a container for fast retrieval.
Keep serviettes (napkins) in a container as well.
Put tablecloths together.
Miscellaneous items such as table runners, doilies, sheet clips, sewing basket, etc, can all be kept together on one shelf.;
, It is much easier to pick up and pull out heavier and bulkier items if they are at the bottom level of the closet. This allows you to kneel down to get them out and there is no risk of them falling on you. Quilts, sheet sets, blankets, etc., are all best placed at the bottom of the closet.
 Some items will fit more neatly rolled, such as towels, face washers, and blankets. Try different ways of fitting the items in to see what fits and to check the ease of removal/addition.
 These look nice, are easy to see, and keep things neat. If you have space, consider adding wire baskets to the inner side of the linen closet door to provide you with additional space.
 Once you have the linen closet sorted, be disciplined to keep it in order. Once this becomes an ingrained habit, you will appreciate how much easier it is to find your linen!

 If you have a friend to stretch with you, lucky for you, you can do two person stretches. It could be as fun as you wish to make it!;
, For example do wrist stretches, and simply roll around your neck.
 Go as far as you can, towards the middle. The other person could push down on your back for about 30 seconds, then you can switch. This should be done first, to warm up your whole body.
 Just sit in a straddle with your friend. (Your feet should be touching your friend's feet). Hold her/his hand, and pull on each other back and forth, for about a minute.
 This time you might want to lightly pull, because the pike stretch is harder for most people.
 Do one where you and your friend sit back to back, in a pike. Drive your arms/shoulders back, and try to reach your friend's feet, but be sure to only go one at a time, or you could bump into each other!

,, If you are willing to take the challenge, sit down in a pike, have your friend lightly pull your arms back, until you feel a slight stretch. After about half a minute, switch.
 Just have your friend lightly pull your elbows instead.
 Also roll your neck around.
, Reach your toes, then pull your arms and shoulders back. Repeat this for about a minute. (Just use a timer.)

, Try the previous step, but inÂ  a straddle.
 Lay down on your stomach. Try a chin stand; just roll your legs over, until you feel a stretch. It can be very hard to do this perfectly, so don't worry if you mess up.
 These can be a good stretch, and relaxing at the same time. Go into your middle splits/oversplits, and reach towards the middle. To make it more fun, you can text your friend while doing this, if you are able to sit up. Hold for about a minute (and try not to boast by text!).
, A fun and creative way to show your flexibility can be touching your toes, then stretch to your head in a seal stretch. Try your best and it could be fun for you!

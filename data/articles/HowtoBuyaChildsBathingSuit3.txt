 Swim diapers have a stronger elastic band than regular diapers do, in order to contain any urine while the baby is in the pool.


You can purchase disposable swim diapers that are used only once and then thrown out.
If you would rather not buy disposable swim diapers, there are reusable swim diapers available for purchase at most baby super-centers. Reusable swim diapers can be used as many times as you like after they have been properly washed. Although they are not as convenient as a disposable swim diaper that can be removed and discarded, reusable swim diapers tend to save money because you donâ€™t have to keep purchasing new packs of swim diapers every time you take your baby swimming.
It is important to remember that swim diapers do not keep leaks from occurring, they only help to contain urine for a short time. You should make sure that you continue to take your child out of the pool and check the diapers regularly.
 Bathing suits that have flotation devices built into the liner are a convenient, affordable option. Flotation bathing suits offer additional protection during swimming.


There are a variety of styles available, including bathing suits with inflatable rings around the middle and those with inner tubing that helps to keep the baby afloat.
Many parents choose to purchase flotation bathing suits in addition to placing their baby in a flotation device while in the water.
One of the best flotation devices for an infant is the ring that provides a place for your baby to sit. Most of these rings also have a device that keeps your child shaded, which will help keep your baby from getting sunburned.

 You can also connect with expectant parents by using an adoption agency. You can search for an open adoption agency by looking online. You can also find a listing at the America Adopts website, which contains links to many individual agencies.You can also adopt using a closed adoption. However, you won’t be “connecting” with the expectant parents.
 Although you may be anxious to connect with expectant parents, you need to give any prospective adoption agency a thorough look-over. Make sure to contact the agency and request information on the following:fees
average waiting time
number of current clients
services offered
geographic reach
education and counseling services available
percentage of successful adoptions

, Many agencies have online profiles which expectant parents can search. You should work with the agency staff to create your profile, including pictures of you, your partner, and your children.
 You also might write a letter to the expectant parents. Often, the letter is addressed solely to the expectant mother, since the father might not be involved. A good letter can be hard to write, but remember the following:Keep the letter brief. The shorter, the better. Also avoid large paragraph blocks, which can be hard to read. Instead, break up the paragraphs into easily digestible chunks.
Explain why you want to adopt. For example, you and your spouse may be infertile. You can state that fact, but don’t provide too much detail about how long you’ve struggled to get pregnant.
Remember to explain how open you want the adoption to be. An expectant parent is looking to see how they will be included in the child’s life after placement. It’s okay to be general: “We want to maintain open communication with the birth mother” is better than saying nothing.
Identify what makes you unique. You have to stand out. Expectant parents are reading many different letters. Being unique doesn’t mean being “perfect.” Instead, be yourself.

 If you are a slacker, you will probably have detention, and get in trouble with teachers. You won't be able to go to the slumber party your friends have been talking about for weeks if your work isn't finished. This will also affect your classes in High school and your future.;
, If your rushing or going to slow, you will feel overwhelmed by the time Friday comes. If you have to do a science project that requires an experiment, make a list of supplies you will need, such as poster board and markers.
 Just say, "Sorry, I can't talk now." and be done with it. Then if they don't stop, then you just ignore them. If that doesn't work tell the teacher that they are distracting.
 Don't talk too much, of course, but don't be that quiet kid. Be friendly, but not too friendly, that looks creepy.
 If you are caught talking in the hall instead of going to class, you could get into big trouble, depending on how many warnings you've had.

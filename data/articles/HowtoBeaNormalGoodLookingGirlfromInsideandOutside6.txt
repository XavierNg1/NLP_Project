 Learn to enjoy finding out about others by talking to them -- and not just about yourself. The better you understand others, the better you’ll understand yourself.
 Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and everyone is beautiful in their own way. Be supportive of other people’s processes; everyone needs help at some point in their life -- and when it’s your turn, people will happily repay your kindness.


Don’t put others down, tell them they're stupid or ugly, or call attention to their flaws. Everyone has flaws, but by learning to recognize the positive things in others, you’ll be able to appreciate and develop them in yourself.

 The type of bleeding that occurs immediately after delivery, within 24 hours of delivery, or a few days after delivery is crucial to help rule out a PPH. The most important parameter for this purpose is the quantity of the bleeding.


Any bleeding above 500 ml after a vaginal delivery and above 1000 ml after a caesarean section is considered as a PPH.
In addition, bleeding that exceeds 1000 ml is labeled as severe PPH and requires immediate medical intervention, especially if there are additional risk factors.
 PPH is generally continuous in flow and is profuse, with or without several large clots. However, clots are much more common in a PPH that develops after a few days of delivery, and this type of bleeding may also be more gradual in flow.
 Some additional characteristics that can help differentiate a PPH from normal post-delivery bleeding or lochia (vaginal discharge consisting of blood, tissue from the lining of the uterus and bacteria) are its odor and flow. Suspect a PPH if your lochia has an offensive smell, or if your flow suddenly increases after delivery.

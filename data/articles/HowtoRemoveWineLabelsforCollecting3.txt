 This method is related to the oven method, but may be easier to handle. Bring some water to boiling, and fill the bottle with it. A funnel may make this easier. Keep the label dry.
 Let the bottle become hot from the water inside.
 With the help of a knife or a razor blade, delicately lift up one corner of the label and carefully peel back. Pull it gently and evenly.
 Labels that need to be removed in this way have a glue that will not dry. To keep the label, you will need to put it on something, such as a clean sheet of paper.

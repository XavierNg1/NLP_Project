 If bone is sticking out through the skin, do not attempt to splint the leg. Instead, keep the ends of the bone and the skin wound as clean as possible. Lay a sterile gauze bandage from a first aid kit over the open wound. If you don't have any gauze handy, place any clean cotton garment, such as a T-shirt or a handkerchief, over the area.The goal is to prevent bacteria from the atmosphere further contaminating the wound.
 Encourage your dog to lie down on the uninjured side, with the leg with the open wound on top. Attempt to keep the leg straight from the hip instead of letting it flap down. To do this, roll up a towel or a piece of clothing and place it underneath the leg to provide something for it to rest on.


Be very gentle when you place the towel beneath the dog’s leg. Moving the leg will cause pain, so take care to cause as little pain as possible.
 Open wounds may present the added problem of bleeding. If your dog’s open wound is bleeding, apply gentle, easy pressure to try to stop the bleeding.Hold a clean towel or gauze against the wound until it stops.
 Take your dog to the vet as soon as you can. When you put him in your vehicle, make sure to prop the leg up straight using the towel. You can have someone sit in the back with him if you can to help. Make sure to drive carefully, avoiding unnecessary bumps.Open fractures are painful so don't be surprised if a normally placid or sweet dog attempts to snap at you. Stay calm, and if necessary, muzzle him or have another person hold his head.

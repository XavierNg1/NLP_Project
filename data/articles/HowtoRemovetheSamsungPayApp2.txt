 This app will be listed among your apps and is indicated by a gear icon.
 On a Samsung Galaxy S6/S7 this option will be listed in the settings. On older models, you will need to tap “More…” from the tabs at the top of the menu and select “Application Manager”.
 The apps will be listed alphabetically.
 This button is located near to the top of the app details page, in place of where the “Uninstall” button normally appears.

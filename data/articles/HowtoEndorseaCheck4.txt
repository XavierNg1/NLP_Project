 Write on the grey lines in the endorsement area on the back of the check. On the first line, write the name of your business.


For example, write "Jim's Hardware Store" on the first line of the check.
Use this method when a check is made out to your business rather than just to you.
 If you want to add any restrictions, then you can do this before signing the check. Just like personal checks, you can add a restrictive endorsement to your business check, indicating you only want it deposited at the business' bank in a specific account, or you can transfer the rights to the check from the business to another individual or business.


For example, writing "For Deposit Only" with your bank and account number ensures the check can only be deposited in one of your business' accounts.
If you want to transfer the check, you can write "Pay to the Order of" and the name of another person or business. Once you have written the transfer endorsement, the transferee must endorse the check in order to cash or deposit it.
 If you have not added a restriction, such as "For Deposit Only," this creates an unrestricted endorsement on your business check, meaning that anyone who has access to the check can cash or deposit the check.


For example, you can write "James Smith, Owner" beneath your business name.
For your endorsement of a business check to be valid, you must be authorized by the business to do so. Your business account will include the names of the authorized agents, who can make payments and deposits on behalf of the business.
Remember not to add the endorsement until you are ready to cash the check, to protect your check from theft. Once you have signed the check with your title and business name, anyone who has access to the check can cash it as the holder.

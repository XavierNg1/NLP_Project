 Making physical contact can reassure someone that you care and are available to them. Put your hand on their shoulder, or give them a hug. If you are not that comfortable with the person you are sympathizing with, shake their hand.Cease any unwanted physical contact. If the person seems to be moving away or uncomfortable making contact with you, do not force it.
 How you say something is as important as what you say. Make sure that your facial expressions match the condolences you are offering in a bad situation. For example, you should not say “I am so sorry for your loss/luck,” with a huge smile.


A neutral expression is usually best. This means relaxed eyebrows, making eye contact, and a neutral mouth (not smiling or frowning).
 The gift you send does not need to be expensive or elaborate. In many cases, just sending a card would be sufficient to express your sympathies. You can also send flowers to someone to express your sympathy for their current plight.
 Another way to show your sympathy and help in a tough time is to bring the person meals. This can free them of the need to cook for several days or weeks, and allow them the time and space to cope with their situation. The more people you can get to participate, the easier it will be to provide steady meals.


There are websites that allow people to sign up for specific meals on specific dates, which may make it easier for you to organize meal delivery. This way, the meals can be spaced out and you won't make the mistake of bringing multiple meals on the same day.

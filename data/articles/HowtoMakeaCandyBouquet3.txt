 Pick a mug that is festive for the occasion, whether it's around Christmas, Thanksgiving, or Valentine's Day. Trace the bottom of the mug over a piece of thick Styrofoam and cut the Styrofoam and place it snugly into the bottom of the mug. You can even try to glue the Styrofoam into the bottom of the mug, but then you -- or the person you're giving it to -- won't be able to use it once all the candy is eaten., Make the dough for chocolate chip, gingerbread, oatmeal raisin, or any other cookies that you like. Before you put them into the oven, cut a small hole in the bottom of the cookies and insert a wooden popsicle stick in each one. It's a good idea to bake a few extra cookies in case some of them break or don't stay on the popsicle stick. Give the cookies at least 10-15 minutes to cool off and harden before you try placing them in the bouquet.
 Spread the cookies out evenly so they stick out neatly above the mug. They can stick out at different angles and heights, as long as the bouquet looks visually appealing.
 Place wrapped candy that goes well with the cookies, such as Reese's peanut butter cups or individually-wrapped Milky Ways, into the bottom of the mug, and place some brown tissue paper on top to cover the candy and Styrofoam.

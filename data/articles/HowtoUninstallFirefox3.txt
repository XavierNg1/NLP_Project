 The Finder allows for easy access to all applications, files, and folders. This is the easiest starting point if you would like to completely uninstall all files associated with Firefox (an especially good idea if your intend to re-install later)., You can search for the file "Firefox.app", or simply search Firefox in the search box and then click on the "Applications" heading on the left of the Finder window. Click on the file and drag it to the Trash (outside of the window, on the desktop scroll on the bottom of the screen)., Firefox will create a large number of files located in various places on your computer. Search for the following:


Delete the contents of these folders: /Users/User/Library/Application Support/Firefox/ and /Users/User/Library/Caches/Firefox .
Delete any files listed as "Preferences/org.mozilla.firefox.plist", which may be found in the "User," "admin," or "bill" library folders.

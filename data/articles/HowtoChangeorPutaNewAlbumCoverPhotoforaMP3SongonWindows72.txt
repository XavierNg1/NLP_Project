 MP3 files support an image as "Album Art." This image will serve as the album art image for every song in that album. Because of how MP3 files work, you cannot set different images for different songs in the same album., If you want to use the official image for the album, perform a Google Images search for the album name. Right-click on the image and select "Save" to download it to your computer. The larger the album image is, the better quality it will appear in the Now Playing window.


If you can't find official album art, or you want art for a mix you've created, you can make your own album image. Open a program like Paint or Photoshop and create a new 600 x 600 px image. This will ensure that the image is high quality and displays well in Windows Media Player.
 Once you've saved the image to your computer, you'll need to copy it. You can do this by right-clicking on the image file and selecting "Copy," or by highlighting it and pressing Ctrl+C.
 You can quickly open Windows Media Player from the Start menu.
 You'll need to be in Library view in order to find the song or album that you want to change. You can browse through All Music or "Albums" to find the right one. You won't be able to change the album art if you are in Artist or Genre view. Note: "Paste album art" option will appear only if you have copied the required album art first.
 If there isn't any album art yet, it will be a picture of a musical note.
 The image that you copied to your clipboard will be made that song or album's new album art. It may take a while to apply the album art to large albums.


This will permanently delete any existing album art, so if you want to switch back to the old image you'll need to find the image file and repeat the process.

 If an off-leash dog begins to approach your dog, command the dog to “Sit,” “Leave,” or “Go home.” To further you message, raise your hand in a “stop” signal, and reinforce it with “No.” If you have doggie treats, put out some treats to distract the approaching dog. If the dog falls for the bait, keep moving past it.Try to create as much distance as you can between your dog, and the off-leash dog. If the dog keeps following you, head home.
 There are times when avoidance tactics just don’t work. To prepare for these situations, carry a stick with you. Carry a stick that is at least an inch in diameter and two feet long, like a walking stick, cane, twirler’s baton, or PVC pipe. The point is to make the stick an obstacle the aggressive dog has to overcome, not a weapon.When an aggressive dog approaches, point the stick at the dogs nose. If the dog stops advancing, take small steps toward it while still pointing the stick at the dog’s nose. If the dog backs up, take another small step. Repeat this until the dog backs down.If the dog does not back down, keep the stick pointed at its nose. Do not swing the stick because it leaves you open for attack, and you could hurt the dog. The point is to have the dog grab the stick with its mouth so that its mouth is preoccupied. Once the dog grabs the stick, do not pull back. Wait for the dog to pull, and when it does, take a step forward. This will push the stick into the dog’s mouth, but be careful not to hurt the dog. Repeat this until the dog backs down.
 Other devices that will help deter aggressive dogs are air horns, rape alarms, and umbrellas. The loud sound produced by an air horn or a rape alarm will startle an approaching dog, and hopefully deter it from advancing. On the other hand, an umbrella is useful in either frightening the dog, or creating a barrier. When a dog is approaching, open the umbrella in front of the dog.

 You can’t delete individual messages from a conversation, but you can delete the entire conversation instead. When you delete a conversation with multiple people, you will leave it but the conversation won’t be deleted from the other user’s phones., Each operating system has a slightly different method for deleting conversations:

iPhone: Swipe the conversation you want to remove and tap Delete.
Android/Windows Phone/Symbian: Press and hold the conversation you want to remove. Tap “Delete Conversation”.






BlackBerry: Select the conversation that you want to remove. Click the physical Delete button on your phone. Select “Delete Conversation” and then select “Yes” to confirm.
 Once you have deleted the conversations that you want, check your main Kik screen to ensure that they are no longer there.

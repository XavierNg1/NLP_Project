 Preheat oven to 350° degrees Fahrenheit or 176° Celsius. Grease and flour a 9x5-inch loaf pan., In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix using a whisk until the dry ingredients are well-combined., Pour in the vegetable oil, vanilla extract, white vinegar, and water. Stir using a whisk or blend using a hand blender, until the cake batter forms and there are no more flour streaks., Using a rubber spatula, scrape the cake batter into both of the cake pans. Remove any leftover batter by scraping the edges of the bowl., Place both cake pans in the oven to bake. Have the cake bake for about 45 minutes, until the cake rises and is fluffy., Remove both pans from the oven and have the cakes cool for about twenty minutes on a wire rack. Leave both cakes until they are cool enough to touch., Consider stacking both cakes to make a two-layer chocolate cake. Frost with chocolate buttercream frosting and/or decorate with any desired toppings such as berries, powdered sugar, coconut flakes, and sprinkles, Slice the chocolate cake and serve on a serving plate. Enjoy!

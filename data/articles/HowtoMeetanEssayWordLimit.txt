 As you count, be sure that you have the word limit in mind. This will help you know how many more words you have to write.;
, This step may not add too many words, but it still may add a few. It will help you know whether any sentences in your essay may sound weird or unusual.


Anytime you get stuck; read it again to see whether any additional phrases or words flow out from reading over it.
Also, some more thoughts may come to mind if you copy it over, and they probably will follow well from what you already have written.
 Even if you are sure that you've researched the topic as much as you can, do it once more. You may find new information to add to your essay that you've missed.
 For example, "He had many great works, like" can be changed to "He had many great works, such as" and it will give you an extra word. Focus on your body in this step, as opposed to your intro and conclusion.
,, The intro and conclusion are two of the potentially most important sections in your essay. The intro, because it introduces your readers to your essay, and the conclusion, because it brings your essay to a close. Be sure that these two paragraphs do just that, and if they don't, add to them so they do.


Do not start the essay with "Hello, my name is _______ and today I will be writing about ________. Instead, start it with the thing that you will be talking about. That should be the first or second word in the essay.
Also, do not end your essay with "Thank you for reading this essay." This makes the essay look unprofessional.

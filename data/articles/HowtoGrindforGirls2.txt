 First, you have to get in grinding position. Though you can mix it up once in a while, typical grinding position is when a guy stands behind a girl. You can leave about a foot between your bodies and don't have to get incredibly intimate to start grinding with the guy -- especially if you don't know him.
 Both you and the guy should bend your knees so that you're lower to the ground. If the guy is much taller than you, then you won't have to bend your knees very much. If the guy isn't much taller than you, however -- this is likely to happen if you're wearing high heels -- then you should bend your knees a bit further so he's a bit above you.
 Now, move your hips and butt in one continuous circular motion, continuing to move from side to side while moving your legs up and down just a bit while keeping your knees bent. If the guy knows what he's doing, then his hips should find a similar rhythm to yours -- your hips should move in the same direction to the beat of the music.









If you're feeling bold, you can touch the guy's front side with your butt as you move it from side to side. But you can also maintain a distance away from the guy.
 Move your arms and chest to the beat of the music, gyrating your arms and chest in the same fluid motion. Look ahead or slightly down as you continue to work your arms and chest while you move your hips. You can bring your arms down so they're on your knees or near your waist, and wait for the guys hands to land on top of yours or around your waist as you continue to dance.

 Most biscuit mixes (like Bisquick, Krusteaz, etc.) are fairly similar, so these directions should work well most of the time. However, if you notice major differences between the instructions below and the instructions on the packaging, stick to the latter for best results. The directions in this section are intended to be general — they may not work in all cases.
 As with the recipe above, you do not need to grease or prepare your baking sheet, though you can if you wish. Proceed to the next steps while you wait for your oven to warm.
 There are only two ingredients in this recipe — the mix and the milk. Pour the mix into a large bowl, then add the milk. Stir lightly to combine. Stop stirring as soon as the dough reaches a uniformly sticky, flaky consistency.


Note that some biscuit mixes may call for you to add oil or butter as well. Check the directions to be safe.
 Turn the sticky dough onto a floured baking surface (you can use the biscuit mix itself as well). Use your hands to turn the dough over on itself 10 times. Kneading more can cause the biscuits to lose their light, flaky qualities.
 From this point on, the directions are almost the same as for the recipe above. Use a roller or your hands to roll the dough ball into a 1/2-inch thick layer. If you wish, you can roll the dough between two sheets of plastic wrap to prevent a mess.
 Use a 2-inch cookie cutter to cut circular biscuits from the flattened dough. Transfer each circle of dough to your baking pan. Re-combine the leftover dough into another ball, roll it flat, and repeat.
 This should take about 8-10 minutes in your preheated oven. When the biscuits are done, let them cool on the pan for about 5 minutes. Transfer them to a wire rack and let them cool until pleasantly warm.

 Look yourself in a mirror and tell, to yourself, that you are a beautiful person. In order to feel confident, you have to believe that you are a beautiful and virtuous person. Go beyond the white patches and go inside of yourself that truly glows a luminous light of splendor.;
, Writing can let anyone's inner emotions out, whether joviality, lividness, insecurities, forlornness, etc. Write a novel, autobiography, poem, your own lyrics of a song you want to write, how you feel and what you want to do. Let all of your inner emotions out of you. Don't just have them all bottled up, as it would get bigger and bigger.
 Cleaning will take your mind of your vitiligo and your insecurities. Clean the bathroom, kitchen, garage, basement and even your own room. Then look at it when you're done and you'll feel accomplished for it, like a goal you were trying to reach.
 I would recommend that you read a book about people who are outcasts and who are different from others, such as: Speak; Bastard out of Carolina; The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn; Oliver Twist; Robinson Crusoe. These are award-winning books that will show that no matter what or who you are, you will make it out there.

 There will be a middle section, a right section, and a left section. This is because the left and right sections are slightly longer than the center section. Pin back the other two sections as you trim but be sure to not to get it mixed up with the rest of your hair., Stop just above where you would like to trim. Hold the scissors at a 45 degree angle and begin make short cuts into the bangs, taking care not to cut them too short. This will make the trim look more natural.
 Take a small bit of the middle section to use as a guide for trimming the side sections. Begin trimming at a 45 degree angle, gradually moving downward to create a gentle slope. This will make the side sections a bit longer than the center section, giving a fun, whimsical look to your bangs.

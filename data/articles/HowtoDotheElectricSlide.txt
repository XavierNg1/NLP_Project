 You should be counting 1, 2, 3, 4 to the beat of the music and take one step after each beat. That means you should take a step to the right with your right foot on Count 1. This is the very first step to doing a grapevine to your right.

, That's why it's called the grapevine -- because you'll be "weaving" one foot behind the other. You can also put your arms into it, and pump them forward or upward slightly every time you take a step. In the "Electric Boogie" video, you can see that the dancers are really pumping their arms, almost as if they were doing the "Running Man" with them; it's up to you how much you want to get into it!

, Simply tap the ground with your left foot without putting your weight on the foot. You'll be taking your next step with your left foot, so you should keep the weight on the right foot. You can also clap your hands whenever you tap your feet to add some flair to this dance move.

Congratulations -- you have just completed a grapevine to the right! The grapevine consists of the moves set out in Steps 1-4.
If you want to simplify this dance and aren't ready for the grapevine, instead of weaving one foot behind the other, you can instead simply step the right foot to the right, step your left foot to the right to meet your right foot, tap it, and repeat. So you would do a step-tap, step-tap, instead of the grapevine. If this is what you choose, then you should also do this move on the left side.
 You will now begin mirroring the steps laid out in Steps 1-4 on the left side.

, This time, tap the ground with your right foot while keeping your weight on the left foot. Great work! You have completed the grapevine on your left side.

, This begins the process of taking three steps backward and tapping your feet. Just as you did before, count off 1, 2, 3, 4 to the music as you take your steps.

, Remember to keep that weight on your right foot. To add some flair to your steps, you can add a knee-lift, kick, toe-point-and-hip-lift, or whatever you want with your left foot instead of just tapping your feet closed, as long as you keep your weight off the tapping foot.

, Many people, instead of tapping with their foot, will kind of do a deep lunge with the left knee, touching (or just reaching for) the floor with their right hand. Others just tap their feet closed.

, Prepare to turn left, getting your hips and arms ready to do the "pivot and brush".

In the original choreography - this is actually a hop - and the turn happens in the air. The brush step was added later.
 This is known as a quarter turn. Turning to the left means that your left shoulder goes back and your right shoulder comes forward. You can kick your right foot up a bit and brush the ground as you transition to the new position; just kick whichever foot is in back to move to the new side, so that it is next to the left foot again. Many will also do a knee lift (with the right knee) and/or clap their hands here.

, Start with the very first step. Note that you -- and hopefully the rest of the group -- will be facing a new direction each time you repeat, continuing to turn 90 degrees after every 18-step cycle. That's the beauty of the line dance -- once you can do it in one direction, all you have to do is to keep turning and repeating it until the music fades.

, A "grapevine" is a series of sidesteps in one direction, stepping to the side, then crossing in front or behind with the other foot, then stepping to the side again. A more detailed breakdown is below. Count 1, 2, 3, 4 to the beat of the music and do the grapevine on the right.

/images/thumb/c/c9/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-20-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-20-Version-3.jpg








, This is just like the grapevine to the right, except it's to the left. Count 1, 2, 3, 4 to the beat of the music and do the grapevine to the left.

, This part is conceptually similar to the grapevine steps, except going backwards instead of sideways. As before, count 1, 2, 3, 4 to the music as you step.

, Count 1, 2 to the beat of the music and repeat the process. Once you've finished, take another quarter turn and repeat until the music is over.

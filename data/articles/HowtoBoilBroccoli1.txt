 Look for broccoli that is uniformly green, without a lot of brown or yellow areas. Feel the stem and crown to make sure they are firm and not limp. Check that the florets are in a nice, tight bunch.You can store raw broccoli in your refrigerator drawer for at least a week. However, its nutritional properties will begin to decline after three days.;
, Fill a spray bottle with three parts water to one part white vinegar. Spray the broccoli well.Alternately, soak the broccoli in vinegar water before cooking it, which will also drive out any insects that may be in it.Rinse the vegetables under cold tap water.


You can wash produce with water alone, but using the diluted vinegar method first removes about 98% of surface bacteria.
To make rinsing easier, place the broccoli in a colander inside of a clean sink basin. Use the spray setting on your faucet to rinse the vegetables.
 Use a sharp knife to cut through the vegetable stem about two inches below the crown. Break the crown apart into big florets. Slice each floretâ€™s trunk to get bite-sized chunks.Remove any damaged or wilted leaves.If desired, save the stalks to add to stew, salad, or stir-fry.You can leave the stalks on if your recipe calls for it. Just peel back and remove the outermost layer, which is tough to eat, with a knife or vegetable peeler.

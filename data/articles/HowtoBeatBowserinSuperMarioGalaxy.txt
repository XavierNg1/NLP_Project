 If several shock waves occur (especially in the last battle), you won't have time to land between each wave, so the use of Mario's spin move in the air can help you stay airborne a bit longer. (Stay at the planet's circular pole; it will help you avoid the shock waves better because they will be more scattered.);
, You require some good timing and a bit of luck. Try to predict when the opening comes around again and time your spin attack accordingly.
 There is no real strategy for this, just run around and try your best not to get hit.
 Be sure not to hit yourself when they come back.
 He'll do this in a circular pattern; you can't attack him at this point, so just avoid him.
 Since he always falls in your direction (and if you're close enough, he lands where you were when he began his jump). Stand over the blue spot filled with lava. When he lunges toward you, run off the blue spot. If done correctly, he will land there, shattering the blue glass and his tail will combust. As he frantically runs around, run in the opposite direction and meet with him halfway around the planet. He will attempt to turn and run away again, but before he can spin and hit his tail. He will then flip over and possibly spin on his shell. You may need to hit him numerous times while he rolls depending on what battle it is. He can get rolling pretty fast so be sure not to get flattened! If you wait too long, the fire on his tail dies away and he begins attacking again.

 Start where you want the cast to begin at the bottom of you arm and measure up to the top of your palm. Write down the number.
 Wrap a measuring tape around the thickest part of your arm. Write down the number. Wrap a measuring tap around your hand just under the thumb. Write down the number.


Add 2 inches to each of these measurements for overlap.
 Use the length and the circumference measurements to measure out a piece of flannel.


Angle down each side from the larger circumference measurement to the smaller one.
 Also cut out cotton batting for the middle in the same size.
 Place one piece of the flannel around your arm. Make sure it overlaps an inch on each side at the thickest part.


The part at the top of your hand will have a whole for your thumb eventually.
 Use an old pair of tights. You can use colored tights or white tights, depending on your preference., Put a piece of flannel on the bottom, the batting in the middle, and a piece of flannel on top. Lay out the strips of tights on top.


The strips of flannel should overlap each other and zigzag across the cast. They should also run width-wise not length-wise.
 Run along the edges of the strips to sew them on. You can use a plain stitch or a zigzag strip.


You can use the same color for the thread as the tights or use a contrasting color.
 Fold the cast in half length-wise. About an inch from the top, cut a round hole big enough for your thumb with small scissors.
 Using a zigzag stitch, run around the edges of the cast and around the thumb hole.
 On the two long sides, sew on matching Velcro strips.
 Velcro it in place.

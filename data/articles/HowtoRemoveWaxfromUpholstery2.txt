 Plug in a clothes iron and let it warm up to a medium heat setting. Read the fabricâ€™s label to ensure that the fabric is iron safe. If the fabric does not have a label, test the iron on a small, inconspicuous spot before applying the heat to a larger area., Iron the brown paper bag. The iron will begin to melt the wax and transfer it from the fabric to the paper bag.A clean rag can be used in place of a paper bag; however, the wax is likely to remain on the cloth after washing.
Be careful to use a paper bag without any writing. The ink from the print will transfer and stain the upholstery. If you use a paper bag from a store with a label, cut the label off of the bag before use.
 Move the paper bag and repeat the process until all of the wax has transferred from the upholstery to the bag., Use an upholstery or carpet cleaner to remove any residual stains after the wax is lifted. Spray the stain and let the cleaner sit for one minute. Then, carefully blot the stain with a clean cloth or paper towel. Repeat this process until the stain is gone.

 Bipolar disorder has a high comorbidity rate with fibromyalgia, so it is important to get a diagnosis if you are having symptoms. Ask your doctor whether fibromyalgia could be amplifying your sensitivity and share your symptoms with your doctor.Pain and tenderness are the main symptoms of fibromyalgia, but you may also experience:Fatigue
Trouble sleeping
Stiffness when you wake up in the morning

, Tell your doctor about the symptoms you’ve been experiencing. Explain in as much detail as you can what you're feeling, when it happens, and what you think may be causing it. Let them know how your symptoms are impacting your life.Be direct and descriptive. For instance, say something like, “The sensation of water on my skin is painful. I have a hard time washing my hands and doing the dishes. This doesn't happen all the time--mostly when my bipolar depression is at its worst.”

, Ask your doctor if medication could be a good option for managing your hypersensitivity from fibromyalgia. Take into account any medications you are already taking.Your doctor may prescribe an antidepressant along with a mood stabilizer. Antidepressants can help to minimize the pain associated with fibromyalgia and a mood stabilizer will help to prevent you from going into a manic phase.It may take some trial and error to find a medication or combination of medications that works for you.
Also, pay close attention to your side effects. These can cause bipolar depression or fibromyalgia to become worse.
 Check in with your doctor frequently and tell them how your medications are affecting you. If you’re not getting good results, your doctor may need to adjust your dose or switch you to a different type.

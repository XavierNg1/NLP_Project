 Many well-intentioned people see a blind person on the street and assume they should help. While it's a good idea to be helpful to those around you, you should never help someone without checking if they need assistance first. Approach and ask before you assist.


Approach the blind person first. Greet them and introduce yourself. Say something like, "Hi there! I'm Michael."From there, politely ask if they need help. Try something like, "I noticed you're trying to cross the street and I was wondering if you needed any help."If the person needs help, he or she will usually let you know. Not all visually impaired people need assistance, so do not be offended if your offer is declined. Simply wish the person a good day and move on., Many blind or visually impaired people have been dealing with their disability for a long time. They are often used to navigating potential threats. While it's important you let a blind person know of a coming car or a low-hanging tree branch, try not to be overly protective. Only advise a blind person to move or duck when it's absolutely necessary.
 Just as you might enjoy observing the scenery when you walk, many blind or visually impaired people enjoy having scenes described to them. When guiding a blind person, it can be nice to tell them about anything noticeable or interesting as you're walking. However, use discretion. Some people may prefer to walk in silence or may find excessive chatter distracting. It's a good idea to ask first before you describe the scene.
 Many people use non-verbal cues, like pointing, when giving directions. You may do this without even thinking when giving directions to a blind person. However, try to remember you need to give out specific verbal directions for a blind person to understand. Say, "You walk three blocks forward on this street and then take a left." Do not point forward and say, "It's three blocks that way."

 If you’re indoors and immediate evacuation isn’t possible, look for a nearby room with a door that locks. Barricade the door with the heaviest furniture in the room. Turn off the lights, silence your cell phone, and call emergency services as soon as safely possible.Don’t peek through or open the door to see what’s happening outside.
Don’t activate the fire alarm if you hear gunfire indoors.
 If the room is on the ground floor or has a fire escape, see if you can safely flee through the window. If window escape is not possible, find covered positions within the room, such as behind a copy machine or under a desk. Take cover and wait until law enforcement arrives., If you’re locked in a room with other people, take a count to keep track of each member of the group. Quietly make a group decision about what to do if the shooter enters the room, such as rushing at the shooter with improvised weapons while others shout and throw objects.When hiding with a group, spread out throughout your space. Huddling together can offer a shooter an easier target.

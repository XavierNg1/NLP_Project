 Babies are very creative. Your baby may find a way to hurt themselves or get into mischief with even the safest of stuffed toys. For that reason, it’s important to always monitor your child while they are playing with the safe stuffed toy. Don’t leave your baby alone even for a moment while they are playing., Babies love to sneeze and slobber on things, including their toys. Safe stuffed toys get yucky after regular use. Wash your baby’s stuffed toys regularly according to manufacturer directions. Wash any safe stuffed toys that fall on the floor or are visibly soiled.Most stuffed toys have a care tag attached to them that provides information about washing and drying. Read the information included on the tag to wash the toy appropriately.
 If your baby leaves safe stuffed toys lying about, the toys might cause others to trip or fall. Help your baby learn from an early age where toys belong once they are no longer being played with.For instance, when your child is finished playing with its safe stuffed toys, say, “It’s cleanup time. Let’s put away our toys in the bin.” Place a safe stuffed toy in the toy chest. If your baby can walk, encourage your baby to do the same.
 If your baby has a toy chest with a heavy lid, they might accidentally slam it down on their tiny head or hands and hurt themselves. In order to avoid this misfortune, choose a chest without a lid. This also makes the safe stuffed toys more accessible to your baby., With a safe stuffed toy in bed, your baby is at greater risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

 Porcelain coating is very fragile and easily damaged from scrubbing and scraping. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to the letter. Otherwise, you could void your warranty., Avoid a brass brush, which can scrape the coating off the grate. Opt for a curved brush that can get in between the grating. Gently scrape in a diagonal motion. Start at the point closest to you and move upward. Move in one direction to minimize the risk of damage to the coating.

If you have built-up gunk like barbecue sauce, wet the brush before scrubbing., Flip the grill over after it has cooled. Scrape away excess food and gunk with the brush using a diagonal motion. The underside will take somewhat longer to clean because of the drippings that accumulated during cooking. Scrub until the grate is completely clean.

If your grate comes in multiple sections, flip and clean each part separately.

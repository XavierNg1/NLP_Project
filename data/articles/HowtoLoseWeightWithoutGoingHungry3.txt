 Calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) in order to help give you an estimate of whether your weight is unhealthy. A BMI is a measurement of body fat based on height and weight. Use a calculator online to find yours: http://www.bmi-calculator.net/. Note that while BMI is not a perfect judge of weight (it has trouble incorporating muscle mass), it is generally accepted as a good estimator. If you are below normal weight, you should not attempt to lose weight.


If your BMI is 18.5 or less, you are considered underweight.
If your BMI is between 18.5 and 24.99, you are considered normal weight.
If your BMI is between 25 and 29.99, you are considered overweight.
If your BMI is between 30 and 34.99, you are considered obese (class 1).
If your BMI is between 35 and 39.99, you are considered obese (class 2).
If your BMI is 40 or greater, you are considered morbidly obese.
 In order to lose weight it helps to know your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). Your BMR tells you how many calories you burn a day just by being alive. It depends on your height, weight, age, and gender. Use a calculator online to find yours: http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/


If you want to calculate your BMR by hand, the formula is as follows: For women: BMR = 655 + ( 4.35 x weight in pounds ) + ( 4.7 x height in inches ) - ( 4.7 x age in years ). For men: BMR = 66 + ( 6.23 x weight in pounds ) + ( 12.7 x height in inches ) - ( 6.8 x age in year ).This number varies widely by person. For example, a 50 year old woman who is 5 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds only burns 1,137 calories by being alive. In contrast, a 20 year old man who is 6 feet tall and 200 pounds burns 2,090 calories just by being alive.
 The number of calories your body actually burns every day, however, varies based on how active you are. The more active you are on a daily basis, the faster your metabolism is, and the more calories your body burns. Use the Harris Benedict Equation to calculate how many calories your body truly burns in one day.This final number tells you how many calories you need to eat to maintain your current weight.


If you are sedentary (little or no exercise) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.2
If you are lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.375
If you are moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.55
If you are very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.725
If you are extra active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job or 2x training) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.9

, To lose weight, you must output more calories than you input. There are 3500 calories in a pound of fat so for every 3500 calories you net output, you lose 1 pound. Aim to reduce your current caloric intake by 500 calories a day, never allowing fewer than 1200 calories per day if you are a woman and 1500 calories a day if you are a man. You may choose to eat 250 calories less and burn 250 calories with exercise to meet this goal.


Note that the less you weigh, the longer it will take to lose weight in a healthy way. Remain patient.

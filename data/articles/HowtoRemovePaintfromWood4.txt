 Also choose between a liquid or paste paint stripper.


Liquid chemicals are often applied in spray form and are usually used to clean coatings or a couple of layers.
Paste chemicals are brushed on and are used to strip many layers of paint. If you need to remove 10 layers or more, choose a paste.
Read the instructions thoroughly before use. While the application procedure is the same for most chemical paint strippers, the exact details may vary. Always follow the instructions that come with the paint stripper.
 Pouring a small amount in a small can makes it easier to use the paint remover.


If possible, use a can with a plastic resealable lid.
 Use a broad flat paintbrush to apply the chemical thickly and evenly over the surface of the painted wood.


Brush the paint stripper on in one direction.
Do not brush over areas that have already been covered by paint stripper.
 If using an aerosol paint stripper, point the nozzle of the bottle roughly 4 inches (10 cm) away from the surface of the painted wood and apply the chemical in an even, thick layer.


The chemical will create a foaming, clinging layer.
 Usually, the paint remover should be left on the surface for 20 to 30 minutes, but exact times may vary.


Keep the windows and doors of the room open to prevent potentially harmful fumes from building up as the chemical sits.
 Rub the blade of a paint scraper over the surface in a circular motion. If the scraper cuts into the paint, the chemical has worked correctly.


Make sure that the scraper you use is chemical-resistant.
 Glide the paint scraper beneath the softened paint to peel it away.


Remove as much as possible with the first few passes.
Work in one direction.
 If some paint still remains, soak medium-grade steel wool in a small amount of paint remover and scrub those spots until they lift up.


Old rags or abrasive scouring pads will also work.

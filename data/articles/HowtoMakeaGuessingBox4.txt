 This role can change through the game, or can be given to an adult or host who doesn't mind sitting out the game.
 The items should be kept inside a bucket/box/behind a screen etc. so that they cannot be seen in advance. Add them when the player is not yet near the box or ask the player to look away.
 At this point, how the game is played can be varied, such as:


The player must guess what it is within a time limit or pass to the next player.
The player must guess the best of a "set of objects".
In each case the player who gets the most guesses wins.
Time limits are important or the guessing can become boring for waiting players.
 It might even be something in the guessing box, which can be an incentive to guess right!

 If you want to study properly, don't just bring your book. You will need a notebook and pencils, pens and highlighters. This will help you pay more attention when reading rather than reading passively.;
, During this, read for content. Try to understand the overall message or story. Put a * with a pencil when you read something that you think is important, rare, or stands out. If you want, just read a page at a time.
 This time, read over, and see if the points with the * are still that important. If they are, Highlight them. There should be no more than 10 lines on a page that is highlighted. The highlighted points would help you find important quotes or sentences when you need them later on, or to study for exams. This way, you can skip reading it again, and only have to read the highlighted important points.
 Pull out your notebook and summarize what you read. Try to make it as short and precise as possible. You can make jot notes or a paragraph, which ever is easier for you to read later on.
 You already read through the passage twice and used your own mind to rewrite and make notes, so it should be stuck in your head. But remember to review every 2-3 days to make sure you don't forget.
 After reading comes the most important stepâ€“recollection. Recollection is what you get grades or marks for. Be prepared to give a thorough and detailed answer to the question, "What have you read?" If you can remember it now you will most likely remember it later. Your brain is like a muscle; you need to train it to do the job by doing it again and again. After all, you did not learn to run without learning to walk. You have learned your mother tongue by repeating again and remembering the use and meaning of every word you have heard from anyone around you.

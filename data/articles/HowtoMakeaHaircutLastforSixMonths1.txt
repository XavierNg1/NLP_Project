 Be open with your stylist: you want a cut that will last a good while. When you make that request, ask what would be most appropriate for your hair type. If your stylist cuts to your hair type, it's more likely to last than if they don't.For instance, finer hair may work best with less layering.;
, When trying to make a haircut last, a long cut will wear better over time than a short cut. That is, a short cut can start to look shaggy fairly quickly, while with a longer cut, you likely won't notice as much of a difference when leaving it for longer periods.Consider choosing a cut that's at least touching your collarbone.
 If you get a cut that is very angular, you'll need more cuts to keep it in shape. Layers, on the other hand, are closer to the natural way your hair grows, so they don't need as much upkeep over time. Choosing layers will keep your cut looking nice as you try to stretch out the time between cuts.

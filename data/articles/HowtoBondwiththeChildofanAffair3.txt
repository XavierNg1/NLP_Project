 No matter what else happens, if you want to rebuild your marriage, the infidelity must stop. Let your spouse know that you expect them to end their affair immediately, if they haven’t already.It’s ideal for your spouse to cut all contact with their paramour. However, since they have a child together, keep in mind that this may not be possible.
Even if going no contact is not an option, your spouse and their former paramour should not be alone together.
Ask your spouse to put your mind at ease by involving you in the conversation whenever they have to talk to their child’s other parent.
Decide on times and methods of appropriate communication, such as before 9pm and on the house phone only.
 Identify the areas where your marriage needs improvement, and prioritize working on your problems. If you still feel conflicted or resentful towards your spouse, it will be difficult to bond with their child.Repairing your marriage will require your spouse’s full commitment, too.
Marital counseling may be necessary to heal the relationship.
 As you move forward, act as a team with your spouse. Talk to each other and reach an agreement before you make big decisions, especially ones that relate to your marriage and family.It is very important to work as a team after infidelity. It may be a good idea for you and your spouse to establish weekly check-ins in which you discuss the state of your marriage, any potential issues, and any parenting decisions.
 While it is important to work on rebuilding your relationship with your spouse, you will also need to be willing to reach out to other people for support. Talk with trustworthy friends, family, and/or a counselor about what you are going through.

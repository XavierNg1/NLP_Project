 With a dry or slightly damp rag or paper towel, blot your stain as soon as possible. Work from the outside of the stain in.


Make sure that you have a white rag or paper towel that doesn’t have any printing on it. Any color on your rag or paper towel could rub off and get into your carpet.






Use lukewarm water to blot the stain if you dampen your rag. Warmer water will be more effective for dissolving materials., You can make an effective stain-fighting solution with many products that may already be in your home. Items like baking soda, white vinegar, and hydrogen peroxide all contain chemicals to fight stains.


Either use an empty spray bottle, or mix in a large bowl that you can dip your cloth in.
 Add equal parts of baking soda and white vinegar, about ¼ teaspoon of each for every 1 cup (240 ml) of water. Stir thoroughly, or pour into a spray bottle and shake.


Use warm water. Warm water will help the baking soda and vinegar to dissolve faster.
Add a drop or two of lemon essential oil to add a nice smell.
This mixture is great for everything from chocolate stains to urine., For tougher stains and brightening of your carpet, mix a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution in with clear dish soap and warm water.Add equal parts of hydrogen peroxide and water.
You can also substitute 2-3 drops of non-bleaching laundry detergent to your solution instead of dish soap.
Hydrogen peroxide is especially effective against blood stains.
 Either spray your cleaning solution onto the affected area and let it sit for 1o-15 fifteen minutes, or dip your rag into the solution and begin blotting.If you are blotting with a damp cloth, have another cloth nearby which is dry. After you see the stain starting to lift, blot the stain with your dry cloth or rag so the carpet doesn’t get too wet.
Once your stain is lifted, you can vacuum the area to further clean and lift the carpet fibers. Pour some baking soda or powdered carpet cleaner down for further cleaning before vacuuming.

 This will secure the poultice within the cheesecloth. 

, It is all just common sense here so judge accordingly. 

,  (The important thing is make sure you have enough comfrey, sheet and cheesecloth material left over to change out the wraps as this should be done three times daily).
 Making sure to cut the cheesecloth wide enough to be folded as well, it will then be placed against the wound within the sheet you will wrap with, keeping the poultice in one place when applied to the wound.  Now you are ready to make the poultice.
 It's simple explained last because everything previously mentioned must always be done first.  All it involves is a placing an appropriate amount of comfrey in warm (NOT hot) water and letting it sit until it becomes slimy. 


Now you have the poultice - it will feel somewhat slimy, like mucilage. Slimy to the touch, it needs to be this consistency to release the medicinal qualities that are absorbed by the body. 
Naturally you will need less comfrey for a wrist or ankle than the amount you would use for a ribcage. Again, it's about using common sense here and the reason I am not giving you exact measurements is simple. Who has a measuring cup on a hiking expedition or in an emergency? 
If you're the accident-prone adventuresome type,  consider bringing dried comfrey in a Ziploc, strips of sheeting and cheesecloth, clip a few good size safety pins to your backpack and a small pot or can for warm water on your next excursion. You would probably pack a small pot before you will pack a measuring cup.
 Then fold the cheesecloth over and place it within the sheet.

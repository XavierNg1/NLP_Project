 Try to connect the drive to another computer. If it works, you know the issue is not in the drive. There are two kinds of drive failure: mechanical failure and logical failure.


Logical failure means that the physical components have not had any damage, and data recovery is cheaper and easier. Mechanical failure may include some broken parts, making it malfunction or fail completely. If you here click sounds coming from your drive, backup all data as soon as you can, and take the drive to a technician. Professionals handle drive issues best.
If you are successful, you may find that the data has mixed up, and you will have some work to do in reorganizing it to its original format.

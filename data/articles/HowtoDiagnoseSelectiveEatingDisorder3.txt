 Occurrences of SED can begin anytime from birth to the age 4. If an adult is experiencing SED, it is likely to have started occurring during childhood.Picky eating phases are common in children between 18 months and 3 years of age, but these phases will usually pass within a few months.
 SED is often occurs alongside other medical or emotional conditions. If the individual has been diagnosed with any of these other conditions, SED is a more likely diagnosis than simple “picky eating.”Consider the possibility of:


Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)

Autism (including Asperger Syndrome and PDD-NOS)
Food trauma
Oral-motor delay
Swallowing disorders
Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD)
Gastrointestinal disorders

, Most picky eaters will succumb under the weight of hunger. Individuals with SED, on the other hand, will not. The fear/anxiety of consuming a certain food will outweigh feelings of hunger in an SED individual. , If SED is left unchecked for long periods of time, it can result in lasting, long-term symptoms. These include weight loss, malnutrition, and/or lethargy. Additionally, SED can be very difficult socially, and may impair a person’s interaction with others.

 Go to https://www.sugarsync.com/login. Input your SugarSync account and password then click the “Log In” button.
 Click on your name on the upper right corner of the page to bring out a menu. Click on the “Deleted Items” link from here.
 The Deleted Items window will be loaded and you can check the contents. All your deleted files from SugarSync are here, as long as you haven’t permanently deleted them. The files are listed with their names, sizes, and date deleted.



Click My Deleted Items. Items deleted from your own folders are stored under this tab.

Click Privately Shared Items. Items deleted from the shared folders are stored under this tab.
 Scroll through the list of files and tick the tick box for the file you’d like to restore. It will be highlighted. You can also tick multiple files to be restored at the same time.
 An action toolbar will appear on the header. Click on the icon of a trash can with an arrow pointing away from it. This is the “Restore”button.


The button is right beside the icon of a trash can with an X, which is the “Permanently Delete” button. Be careful on which you click.
 The selected file will be restored immediately to its previous location. Go there and check it out.

 Take care not to scrape your leather—use a plastic scraper, spatula, butter knife, or credit card to make sure you don’t damage the leather (more than the gum already has anyway)., Leather soaps like Ivory Snow or Armor All work well for this. Mix the soap with the water so that it forms a thick foam. You will only be using the suds of the foam., Gently rub the suds into the gum stain. Continue to rub until of the gum remnants are removed. Only apply the suds to the affected area.
 Once the area is dry, apply a leather conditioner to restore any discoloration created by the gum.

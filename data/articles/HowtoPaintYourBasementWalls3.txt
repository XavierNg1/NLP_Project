 Select a water-resistant masonry paint made specifically for porous concrete surfaces. A water-resistant paint will serve as a moisture barrier for your basement, and the alkali resistant coating will provide increased durability.


Select a paint color that complements your d√©cor. Masonry paint is available in a wide range of colors at home improvement and paint stores.
 With the lid on, pick up the paint container and shake it vigorously to mix the contents.
, For best results and increased moisture protection, apply 2 to 3 coats of paint.


Use a polyester/nylon brush or roller to apply the primer. The brush should be approximately 4 inches (10.2 cm), and the roller should have a 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch (1.3-cm to 1.9-cm) cover.
Cut in a 2- to 3-inch (5- to 7.6-cm) border around the top, bottom and sides of the walls. Start by applying paint in 1 corner and continue along the edge of the basement wall.
Paint the walls in 4-foot by 2-foot (1.2-m by .6-m) sections. As you apply the paint, overlap into the previously applied areas, including the cut in areas, for consistent coverage. To avoid paint drips, lightly tap the paintbrush against the inside of the bucket or tray to remove excess paint before applying to the walls.
Allow the paint to dry for at least 4 hours in between paint coats.
Evaluate the coverage after the second coat of paint. The walls may need a third coat of paint, or spot applications may be necessary.

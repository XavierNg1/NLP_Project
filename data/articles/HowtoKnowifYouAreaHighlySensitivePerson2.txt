 As an HSP, you are the ultimate giver. Highly sensitive people are typically the most caring friends and family members. You are there at the drop of a dime when a friend needs a shoulder to lean on. You would give your loved ones the shirt off your back.


You have trouble saying “no”. Your desire to help others can drain you of energy and push you beyond your resources. Plus, your sensitivity to other’s disappointment makes you give in to requests even when you don’t want to because you fear hurting someone’s feelings. This characteristic can make some HSPs come off as “people-pleasers.”, Emotional sensitivity is the HSPs greatest strength. You can quickly sense when another is hurt or uncomfortable. This makes you an effective communicator because you are able to offer support or change topics to make a conversation more pleasant.


Your empathy also is a double-edged sword. Because you easily pick up on other’s emotions, you are often more distressed. For instance, if a friend is upset, you may find yourself becoming distraught, too., HSPs natural sensitivity makes you more inclined to take minor comments or offenses personally. Your loved ones may frequently accuse you of overreacting or being too emotional.


This strong onset of emotions occurs even when you’re alone. For instance, a negative train of thoughts can escalate into knee-jerk and possibly self-destructive behavior., The depth of emotion you feel and your tendency to take things personally causes you to take criticism to heart. Upon receiving initial feedback, you may become emotional or hurt by another person’s perception of you.


On the flip side, your tendency to think deeply allows you to closely consider criticism and find ways to use it to your advantage. Whereas others might dismiss criticism, after managing the initial emotional reaction, you are more likely to use the feedback for future growth.

 To ensure that your Tide Pods dissolve properly, always place them in the washer before you put in your laundry. Placing pods at the bottom of the machine allows for the maximum contact with water necessary to dissolve them. If you need to place laundry in the machine to gauge your load size, do so and then remove it to place the Tide pod at the back or bottom of the barrel., Make sure that your washing machine is loosely packed. Overloading your machine will prevent the level of agitation during washing that is necessary for your Tide pods to completely dissolve. When placing clothing or other laundry items in the barrel, avoid pushing or pressing them in to make more room., To avoid stains or issues with your Tide pods not dissolving, do not open Tide pods to use for pretreating. Pods are formulated with super-concentrated detergent that is released during the wash cycle. The stain remover included in Tide pods should be adequate for dealing with stains.

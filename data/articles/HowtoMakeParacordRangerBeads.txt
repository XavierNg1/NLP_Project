 You are making a shape that sort of looks like a tilted "4." The looped part should be pointing upward. The top cord should be pointing to the right, and the bottom cord to the left. Most of the cord should be on the right side.Try to use 550 paracord, if you can.You will need about 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) of paracord to make one bead.;
, Fold and twist the right-hand cord into another loop. It should be overlapping the first one. Again, the front cord should be pointing to the right., Hold the two loops so that the right edge of the first one is in the middle of the second one. Thread the right end of the cord down through the second loop and up through the first one. Weave it back down through the first loop. You will now have three loops., You will now have four loops with a hole in the center., Pull the end of the cord upward so that it is parallel to the edge of the second loop. Twist and adjust the looped cord until you have a ring shape., Cut 30-inch (76.2-centimeter) length of paracord in a contrasting color.If you can, try to use 550 paracord., Make sure that you are pushing it through the folded end first. Stop when you have about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) sticking out of the top of the ring., Gently tug on both ends of the bead's cord. Then, tug on the loop, one by one, until the bead tightens. Keep pulling here and tugging there, until the bead is snug around the folded cord. It needs to be loose enough so that you can still slide it up and down., The bead will have two long cords sticking out of it. Cut these off as close to the bead as you can. Some types of paracord are white inside, which will show. If you want a nicer finish, color the white part in with a marker. Use a color that matches the paracord., The cut ends of the cords will fray if you don't. Using a heating rod, press the end of the tool against the cut end of the bead. Roll it back and forth, then left it away. The cut end of the cord will have melted and sealed itself.You can also seal the beads with a lighter., Paracord ranger beads are used for counting paces. You will need a total of 14 beads for your counter. You want 9 beads at the bottom of your counter, followed by a knot, then 5 more beads.Leave enough space between the knots so that you can slide the beads apart.
 Hook it onto a clip or keychain ring.You can also skip the knot at the top (looped) part of the cord, and feed it through a keychain ring in a slipknot instead.

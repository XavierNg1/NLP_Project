 You will see the map screen. Look at the bottom of the screen, where you should see your avatar on the left, the Poké Ball in the middle, and a white bar with Pokémon shapes on the right.;
, A green menu screen should appear. You should see the buttons Pokémon, Shop, Items, Pokédex, an “X,” Settings, and Tips.
 This button should bring you to the Shop. You will see how many PokéCoins you have at the top of the screen, between the Shop heading and the Poké Balls available for purchase. There will be a gold coin icon next to the number of coins that you have.
 Scroll past the Items, such as Poké Balls and Lure Models. Scroll past the Upgrades (the Bag Upgrade and the Pokémon Storage Upgrade).
 You will see six different options for PokéCoins, ranging in price from smallest to largest. They all have different pictures, but they are the same currency.
 You will get a better deal per PokéCoin if you purchase PokéCoins in bulk. However, do not feel that you need to make a huge purchase in order to enjoy the game.
 The game may take a little bit of time to load.
 You might enter your Touch ID, Apple ID, Google Play ID, or any other pertinent information your phone needs to make this in-app purchase.
 You will have the options of “Buy” or “Cancel.” If you wish to buy the PokéCoins, press “Buy.” If you do not wish to buy the PokéCoins, press “Cancel.”

 Count out the number of bands you'll need for your bracelet. You will probably need around 20 for a child's bracelet and around 30 for an adult's bracelet. You will also need one C-clip, which you can usually find in the same craft store aisle as the loom bands.


Sometimes the clips will be included when you purchase the loom bands. Double-check to make sure you have everything you need.
You can make a striped bracelet by alternating between two colors, or a fun rainbow pattern by using a mix of colors.;
, Slide this circle inside the C-clip. This is the beginning of your bracelet. We'll call this band #1.
 Slide this band (#2) halfway through the circle you made in Step 2. Pull the ends up and hold them together.
 Make sure you keep holding the ends of band #2 together while you do this or the chain will come undone! Now band #2 is securely part of the chain, and band #3 looks just like band #2 in the previous step.
 Slip one loop of the final band through the other loop and pull tightly. Slide the last band's remaining loop into the C-clip from Step 2


If you aren't sure whether your bracelet is long enough, wrap it around your other wrist. Make sure it's not too tight! Wearing a bracelet that's too tight might disturb blood circulation or cause swelling.

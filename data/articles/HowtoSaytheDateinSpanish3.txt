 Let's say the date is April 2, 2013. Just write "2."



Ex: "2..."

, This means "of" and it should always go after the day of the month, since it will be connecting that day to the month.



Ex: "2 de..."

, Before you can write the month, you should know how to write and say all twelve months in Spanish. Note that unlike in English, you don't have to capitalize the names of the months in Spanish. Here are the names of the months:


January = enero

February = febrero

March = marzo

April = abril

May = mayo

June = junio

July = julio

August = agosto

September = septiembre

October = octubre

November = noviembre

December = diciembre


Ex: Still using the sample date, April 2, 2013, write, "2 de abril..."



, This should follow the month to eventually connect the month with the year.


If the date will follow a year in the 2000s, use "del,"; if it will follow a year in the 1900s, use "de."

Ex: "2 de abril del..."

, The last step is to write down the full year of the date you're writing. This will connect the day, month, and year together and will complete the date.



Ex: "2 de abril del 2013."
Just remember one exception to this rule. If the date is the 1st, you should write the number 1 with a superscripted 0 above it (1^0) to stand for "primero," or the way to say "the first" when you're talking about dates in Spanish.

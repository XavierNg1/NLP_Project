 Ensure that it is large enough to suit your needs in terms of cutlery.


If using a used pot, ensure that it is well cleaned and all dirt has been taken off it. Avoid using a used one that looks ragged or is chipped.;
, Give it a wash.
 When you wash cutlery by hand, lean the pieces upright inside the pot. The water will drain into the saucer, which you can empty by hand afterwards. The cutlery has plenty of room to drain and even air dry if you don't feel like drying up straight away.


If you can't place the pot on the sink, place it on a non-porous saucer, so as not to spoil the surface it is sitting on. However, you'll need to empty the water from it after each drying session, to avoid spills.

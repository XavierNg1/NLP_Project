 Of course, first you need to write a sentence that needs a citation from the U.S. Constitution. Try writing one that directly references or quotes the U.S. Constitution. Only then will you need a citation at the end.


Take the same example from above: In the United States, citizens are guaranteed the right to freedom of religion.
 Chicago style works a little differently in that you add a footnote rather than a citation in text. Basically, you tell your word processing software to add a footnote at the end of the sentence, after the period this time. It creates a number that connects to the same number at the bottom of the page.For example, your sentence would look this way: In the United States, citizens are guaranteed the right to freedom of religion.1

The number will be in superscript, as it is in the example.
To add a footnote, put the cursor at the end of the sentence. Choose "References" and "Insert Footnote." The word processing system will do the rest.
 The footnote at the bottom of the page is where you'll put your reference. Start with "U.S. Constitution." Follow that with the amendment, section, article, and/or clause. Use Roman numerals for articles, and Arabic numbers for everything else.For example, your footnote would look like the following example: 1. U.S. Constitution, amend. 1.
When naming a section, use "sec." not the section symbol "ยง."

, Unlike APA and MLA, you don't need an end citation when you're citing constitutions. The main reason you don't need the citation is that these are common documents that are easy to find, and the point of the end reference is to point the reader to the source.

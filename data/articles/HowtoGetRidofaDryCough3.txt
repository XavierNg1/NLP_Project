 Dry air can cause secretions in your nose to dry up and create discomfort that often leads to coughing, but a humidifier can help.Be cautious about using the humidifier too much—if a humidifier isn’t cleaned, it can pump fungus and mold back into the air. This can extend your cough rather than eliminate it.
 Make sure to close all of the windows in your bathroom and turn off the fan. Doing this will create your very own steam room. Steam loosens secretions in your nose. Steam works against coughs caused by colds, allergies, and asthma., Boil a pot of water, then remove the pot from the stovetop and place it on a heat-safe surface. Then hold your head over the water and breathe in the steam. You can place a towel over your head also to help trap the steam in.


Try adding thyme leaves the water for extra relief.

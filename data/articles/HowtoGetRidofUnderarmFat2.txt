 One way to improve the look of your underarms is by targeting the muscles around the underarm and strengthening them.This includes the triceps (located on the underside of your upper arm above your elbow), pectorals (located over your chest), and latissimus dorsi (known as "angel wings" or lats near the backside of your underarms). Toning the muscles near your underarms will tighten muscles and create more appeal in this area.
 Push-ups target many muscle groups throughout the body, particularly the muscles surrounding the underarm. Make sure you keep your body straight, as if your body is a straight plank from head to toe. If this position is difficult, drop your knees. Start with 3 sets of 10 and increase amount with skill.


Change your hand position to create challenge. Arms spread far apart will work back muscles, and hands placed closer together--such as creating a diamond shape with pointer fingers touching at the top and thumbs touching at the base-- will work triceps.
 Dips help build tricep muscle by relying on your triceps to support your weight as you dip your body. Use an exercise machine designed to work tricep dips, or use a bench, making sure to use good form. Do 3 sets of 10.
 This exercise works the muscles down the length of the spine as well as the backs of the shoulders, the buttocks, and even the backs of the arms and legs. Lie on your stomach with your legs outstretched and ankles touching. Your arms should be outstretched upwards, palms down facing forward by your face. Raise your legs and arms so that only your midsection is against the floor, and hold this position for 30 seconds. Repeat.

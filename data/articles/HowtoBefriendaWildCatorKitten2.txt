 Ask around your neighborhood to see if anyone has lost their cat. Cats that get outside can get lost or roam around. Make some calls to local veterinary clinics and pet stores to see if anyone is missing a cat; taking a photo with your phone and making up fliers or posting to social media sites can also help reunite a stray cat with its owners.


If the cat is feral instead of stray, it will not have an owner to be returned to.
 Once you are able to approach the cat and pet it, make an appointment with your veterinarian to have the cat examined and neutered or spayed. If funds are tight, call your local humane society to see if there are any funds available to assist with these costs.


The cat will have a tiny bit of blood drawn to test for the feline leukemia virus. If the results are positive your veterinarian will discuss options with you, which include isolating the cat from other cats for its life or euthanasia. If it is negative, a fecal sample will be looked at to determine if the cat has intestinal parasites and it will be given the appropriate medication.
In addition, the veterinarian will check for fleas and ticks and treat if needed. Vaccines (rabies, distemper, and possibly feline leukemia) will be given and its sterilization operation will be performed. A microchip may also be placed under the skin if so desired. This is highly recommended.
 Now you will have a healthy pet to take home after its operation and vaccinations. Your hard work will pay off knowing you have saved another cat from a harsh life on the street. Either adopt the cat yourself or find another loving home for it to go to.

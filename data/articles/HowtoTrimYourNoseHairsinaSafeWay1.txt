 Trimming scissors have a rounded tip designed specifically for safety when trimming hair in sensitive places, such as noses and ears.


Facial hair trimming scissors can be found at most major retailers in the cosmetic section.;
, Good lighting helps you see the lighter hairs that may be sticking out of your nose, while the mirror helps you effectively groom the hairs.


Even though the scissors have a rounded tip, you need to pay close attention to where you are sticking them. Watch your hand and the scissors closely.
 Never shove the trimming scissors into your nose, because you can do a lot of damage to your nose by puncturing something.


Before inserting the scissors into your nose, make sure the scissors have been cleaned.
 Just remove the hairs that affect appearance - those sticking out around your nose. The hairs further inside your nose need to remain there to help keep harmful pollutants from your body. Removing nose hair completely could have negative side effects.Make sure your scissors aren't dull. Dull scissors will have a harder time cutting some hairs, and they might even pull out hairs, causing pain and eye watering.
Push your nose straight up to get a better view inside your nostrils. Also try smiling. Both of these methods might reveal additional peeking hairs.
 Wipe the scissors with antiseptic before you put them away.

, There are many ways you could add ribbons to flip flops. Here are just a few suggestions to inspire you:


Wrap ribbon around the straps in their entirety.
Wrap dual color ribbon around the straps.
Add ribbon bows, rosettes or roses.
Add ribbon butterflies.
Using silk or satin white/cream ribbon wrapped all the way around the straps but also forming an overlapping "V" shape in the middle, on which you can embroider or sew on pearls. Perfect for a wedding.
 Placement will depend on which of the above ways or combination of ways to embellish the flip flops with ribbon you've chosen. You can use poster tack to design the look temporarily, then go ahead and add permanently when you're satisfied with the look.
 Use the straps for small ribbon embellishments and for wrapping, while the central meeting point of the straps can be used for larger ribbon features, such as a ribbon bow or butterfly.
 Done.


Depending on the ribbon's makeup, these may not be ideal when wet. Bear that in mind when choosing the type of ribbon.

 Electrolysis is available at some salons and plastic surgeries. Electrolysis is a hair removal method that includes a tiny needle being inserted into each hair follicle to destroy the root with an electric pulse. It is most recommended for smaller areas because it takes a long time.


Usually need treatment every 1 or 2 weeks until the hair is gone.

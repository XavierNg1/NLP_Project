 When photographing animals, like with most other photography, it is helpful to have an understanding of photographic elements such as, exposure and composition. These techniques will help to ensure that you get the best results., When photographing animals outdoors, you will be relying on natural sunlight. The early morning and late afternoon hours are usually the best time for taking photos outside. At this time the sun creates a golden light, that works well for photography.Alternatively, overcast days can also create ideal lighting, as the clouds filter the light evenly.
Using flashes can be distracting to animals, and may scare them out of position.
 If you have no choice but to shoot in bright light, you should try to shoot as close up and tight to your subject as possible. This will help get rid of any shadows or other distractions from the photo., When photographing animals, you are working with a subject that you have little to no control over. Because of this, you should be prepared for it to take a significant amount of time. You have to be willing to wait in order to capture the unique, unplanned moments that are created by the animal.

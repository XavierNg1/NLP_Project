 Dig a 4 block long, 2 block wide hole starting from your door. The length of the hole depends entirely on how long you want the trap to be.


Make the hole 5 blocks deep.
 In the bottom of your trap hole, make a base for your sticky pistons to rest on. This can be whatever block you want so long as itâ€™s only a block high. Just dig more to the sides if you need some room to work with.
 Make the assembly 2 pistons wide and 4 pistons long.
, On top of the sticky piston, place whatever block you want as the floor of your trap.

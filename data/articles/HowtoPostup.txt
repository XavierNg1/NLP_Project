 Go down low in the key, near the block, and prepare to receive the entry pass from your teammate.;
, Place your back against the defender and make as much contact as possible.
 This will seem to make you shorter, but it will allow you more mobility and faster reaction time to jump for the ball. This also helps give you a lower center of gravity.
 This will give you more power.
 Usually you can use your outside hand to get the ball, while your inside hand can fend off the defense and keep control.
 Be aggressive; you have to want it. If needed, jump towards the ball so that you create separation from your defender.
 This will keep him from reaching in (it's seldom called) and stealing the ball.
 If a defender doubles on you, wait until he is close to you to pass the ball. Hopefully your teammate is smart enough to cut to the basket when he is open. If not, just pass it back out.
 Dribble close to the ground with your back to your defender and push him under the basket.
,, This move must be lightning fast. Make sure you get the ball over or behind your defender's head. This makes it impossible for him to block your shot without fouling you.
 This shot takes a lot of practice. Alternatively, pivot and fake like you are going to shoot a turnaround, then jump towards the basket and lay it in as he flies past you or jump into him and get the shooting foul.

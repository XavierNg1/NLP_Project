 Before you can be prescribed mood stabilizers, you need to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder. You will need to be fully examined by your doctor for a diagnosis. This will include a physical exam to rule out other possible reasons for your symptoms.Once your doctor rules these out, you will be sent to a mental health professional for a psychiatric analysis to determine which type of bipolar disorder you have.


The symptoms of bipolar disorder will vary, depending on if you are experiencing a manic or depressive episode. , There are certain forms of dementia that can be treated by mood stabilizers such as lithium, valporate and carbamazepine. If you suffer from dementia with the added symptoms of impulsivity and aggression, your doctor may consider prescribing you mood stabilizers.


You may also be prescribed mood stabilizers if you have dementia with manic-like features.
The dosing on these will vary greatly depending on your particular case. Always follow your doctor’s dosing instructions., One of the biggest issues faced when elderly adults need to be prescribed medication is the possibility of drug interactions. Common mood stabilizers can be harsh drugs and the possibility of interaction is high. When you are working with your doctor to treat your bipolar or other disorder, make sure your doctor knows every medication you are on to lower the risk of interactions.


Since elderly adults are prescribed so many more medications, this makes them a higher risk for drug interactions., Since mood stabilizers can be hard on an elderly adult’s body, you should only take medication when it is necessary. Ask your doctor if there is any other way to treat your bipolar disorder aside from medication.


The need for medication is common with bipolar disorder in patients of all ages, but there may be alternative treatment options to consider before you are put in medication.

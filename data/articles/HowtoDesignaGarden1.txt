 Each region has what is known as a "hardiness zone." Your hardiness zone (a category developed by the US National Arboretum) will tell you what temperatures you can expect, as well as which plants are viable for your climate., Check out garden books from the library and buy gardening magazines. If possible, find books and magazines that are written for your specific climate or hardiness zone. If you come across any specific plants you like, find out if they are compatible for your region., Going to see different gardens can be an excellent source of inspiration. Look for landscaped gardens at public buildings, such as botanical or community gardens. You can also sign up for a home and garden tour in your area.

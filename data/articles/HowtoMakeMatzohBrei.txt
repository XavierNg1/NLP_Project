, It fries fast so watch it and turn it over once,and serve on a platter. You might notice that the example in the picture is cut in quarters to make it easier to turn and serve. Keep the heat down and check regularly so you don't burn it.


Alternatively, you can fry it as you would scrambled eggs. Stir with a wooden spoon, as you would scrambled eggs until the mixture is cooked. The eggs will look dry.
 Transfer to a plate, sprinkle with sugar if you'd like, and serve while hot.

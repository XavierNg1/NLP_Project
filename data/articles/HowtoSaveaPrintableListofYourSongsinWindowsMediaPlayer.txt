You can also open the Start menu, click "All Apps", and navigate to "Windows Accessories". Notepad is in the Windows Accessories folder.
 You'll need to drop the file inside Notepad's editing interface.Snapping Notepad to one side of the screen and the playlist folder to the other is the easiest way to do this.

 To do this, highlight the "<media src=".." tag from the beginning of a directory line, then copy it with Ctrl + C. Make sure you highlight the line all the way up to and including the "\" before an artist's name.
 Make sure your mouse cursor is set at the beginning of your document to ensure that the Find and Replace feature formats your entire document.
 You can just add a space (Space) to the "Replace" field.
 If Word asks you for permission to search from the beginning of the document, click "Yes".

 File tags you'll see are .mp3, .mp4, .wav, and so on; these are at the end of your directory lines. Delete them by copying and pasting the "."/>" text from the end of a directory line into the "Find" field and placing a space in the "Replace" field of Find and Replace.


You'll need to repeat this process a few times if your files aren't all in one format.
You should also consider replacing the "\" separations with a double space. Doing so will separate your artist names, albums, and song names into distinct columns.
 You'll see a set of HTML tags before the first artist's name appears at the beginning of the article; similarly, there is a set of HTML tags at the end. Select these and tap Delete to get rid of them. These should be the last chunks of non-plaintext writing.

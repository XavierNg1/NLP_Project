 If you find that you are having cognitive problems, like forgetting things or having trouble thinking, you may want to talk to your family or friends. Ask them to help you stay focused and remember things, or to remind you or prompt you when you need it.You may not be able to stay focused on your own. Your family or friends may be able to help you come up with a schedule, reminders on your phone, or other ways to help you manage any cognitive difficulties.
You might say to your family, “I am having some cognitive problems because of my MS. I would really appreciate you helping me remember things.”

, Getting overheated can cause fatigue if you have MS. Fatigue can lead to loss of focus.To help with this, stay cool. Wear loose-fitting clothing that breathes, keep your house at a cool temperature, and stay out of the heat as much as possible.You can be triggered by any heat-related activity, such as hot baths or even eating hot meals.
 Proper rest is very important when you have MS. Adopt a regular sleep schedule where you go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day. Even on days off or weekends, try to sleep only an hour later. Try to get seven to nine hours of sleep each night.Since muscle spasms may interfere with your sleep, you may want to talk to your doctor about treating these symptoms so you can sleep better.
Go to the bathroom before bed. Try to limit the amount you drink before bed to limit your trips to the bathroom at night.
 Exercise is important for managing physical MS symptoms, but it may also help with cognitive symptoms.Add at least 20 to 30 minutes of exercise into your daily routine to help you stay focused. This exercise can be walking, riding a stationary bicycle, yoga, tai chi, swimming, or hiking.


Talk to your doctor about what exercise is appropriate for your MS symptoms and fitness level.

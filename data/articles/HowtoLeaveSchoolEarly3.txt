 If you are under 18, this method will require that you fake a note from your parents or guardians saying you have to go to the doctor. If you’re not comfortable forging a note and a signature, consider a different method. Be sure that the note

includes the date
begins with the phrase “Please excuse ___(your name)___...”
says exactly when you need to leave
explains specifically where you are going (to the orthodontist, the optometrist, etc.)
says you’re not coming back that day
has your parent or guardian’s signature at the bottom
is free of spelling and grammatical errors (so that it’s clear an adult wrote it)
is a tiny bit crumpled as if it’s been in your backpack


Note that this method doesn’t really work unless you can drive yourself home. If you have to have someone come pick you up, the jig will be up!
Depending on your school, the consequences for turning in a forged note may be pretty severe. Some schools will give you detention, suspend you, or in extreme cases, even expel you. Think hard about whether it’s worth the risk! Depending on why you need to leave school early, it’s possible that your parents or guardians might write the note for you, so consider asking them before you go to the trouble of faking the note.
 It will seem more believable if you hand in the note right away. Follow your school’s policies for doing so. You may need to give the note to your homeroom teacher or turn it in in the principal's office.
 If your note said that you were leaving early to go to the orthodontist, be careful not to slip up and say you have an eye appointment this afternoon! Stick with minimal details, and you are less likely to get caught., When it reaches the time your note said you had to leave, raise your hand and remind your teacher that you have to go. Pack your bags and leave without causing a ruckus. The more you can fly under the radar, the better! Act as casual as possible. People will suspect that you’re lying if you make a big fuss out of leaving.

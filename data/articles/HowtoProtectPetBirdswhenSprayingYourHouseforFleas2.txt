 If your dog has fleas, you can administer a black walnut capsule or liquid on a weekly basis to fight fleas. Ask your vet what dose to administer to your dog. You might also use flea treats, a tasty snack available to both cats and dogs that contains high doses of vitamin B, which can help your pet fight its flea infestation.
 Vacuum your entire residence completely. Don’t forget to vacuum those hard-to-reach places like beneath drapes and curtains, and between two closely-placed pieces of furniture. Additionally, wash your pet’s bedding regularly. If your dog or cat has a special bed where they rest or sleep, wash it regularly. Use hot soapy water. Check the bedding for a care tag that provides specific directions for laundering., Keep your pet’s coat and skin healthy and strong by feeding it a high-quality diet of fresh, raw, whole foods with vitamins C and B. Add a spoonful of coconut oil to your pet’s food. Coconut oil is great for fighting yeast infections of the skin and ears. Additionally, wash your pet regularly. Comb your pet at least once a week to manually remove any fleas that might be hitching a ride.If you need help identifying a pet food that includes fresh, raw, whole food ingredients, consult your local pet store proprietor, veterinarian, or pet nutritionist.
If you already have a flea infestation, comb your pet daily (or several times daily) with a fine-toothed comb. Dip the comb in water after each pass over your pet’s coat. This will remove the fleas from reattaching to your pet.

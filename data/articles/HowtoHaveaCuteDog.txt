 Grooming is always essential to make your dog look cute. Nobody thinks a stinky, dirty, muddy, and matted dog is adorable! Bathe, brush, clean the ears, eyes, brush the teeth, clip the nails, and spritz with a little doggie cologne. For more specific details on grooming, check "How to Groom A Dog" article.;
, Nobody likes even the cutest dog that yaps, pulls on the leash, or doesn't sit or stay when told! Teaching tricks is even cuter.
 Everyone thinks a dog is cute if it likes their dog!

, If the dog exhibits excessive barking or jumping on people, this can be anti-social. Proper training is recommended to correct such behavior.
 Cute collars make every dog look amazing!

, Don't think that only small breeds can be limited to clothing. You can dress up larger breeds too, if you know where to buy the clothes (internet is very useful). Don't make your dog dress up if it doesn't want to, although many dogs purely enjoy being dressed.
 Everyone thinks an owner and dog "couple" is adorable!

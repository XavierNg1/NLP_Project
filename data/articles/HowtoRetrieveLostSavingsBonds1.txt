 The US Department of Treasury has created a website where you can search for lost savings bonds that have stopped accruing interest. Visit this website and begin searching for your lost, missing, or stolen savings bonds., The “Treasury Hunt” database contains information on E and EE bonds issued during or after 1974 that have reached maturity (or have stopped accruing interest).The best way to search for mature bonds is by using the bondholder's Social Security number. If the bond was a gift, the registered number might be the giver's Social Security number.
 If you do not have the social security number of the bond holder, another option is to search using the Bond serial number. See if you can locate your missing bonds this way., Once your mature bond has been located, you can request an electronic version of the bond, or you may have the bond cashed and the money deposited into a bank account of your choice.If Treasury Hunt does not find your bond, you will need to file a Form 1048, which requests the Department of Treasury to search for the bond using other information.

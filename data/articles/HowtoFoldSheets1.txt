 This is the sheet with the elasticized edges that hugs the mattress.

, Stand while gripping the sheet in front of you. You'll put your hands in 2 adjacent corners (the fitted parts) on 1 of the sheet's shorter sides, because you'll be folding these corners together.
 Fold the bed sheet corner in your right hand over the corner in your left hand.
 Keep the 2 corners of the fitted sheet on your left hand. Reach your right hand down and grasp the corner hanging in front. Raise that corner and fold it over the 2 corners in your left hand. The visible corner will be inside out.









Now grab the last corner and fold it over the other 3 corners on your left hand.
 Fold the 2 ends in so that the elasticized area is lying on top of the sheet. Fold the sides over so the elasticized edges are hidden, then continue folding into a rectangle that's the size you want.









Iron it while folded if needed.

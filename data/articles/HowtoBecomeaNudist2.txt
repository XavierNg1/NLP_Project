 Not topless or in your underwear, completely naked. Sleeping naked promotes relaxation and thus improves the quality of your sleep. On warm nights, sleep naked and skip bed-coverings, too, and see how good you feel fully exposed to the open air.


If you find sleeping naked difficult, work your way up to it. Shed one piece of clothing, for example your pajama top, and when you’re accustomed to sleeping without that, shed the next piece, and so on until you’re sleeping nude.
Try opening a window near your bed (keeping the blinds closed) to let a breeze in. Remember that part of being a naturist is to feel closer to the natural world.
 Stay naked after a shower. Towel dry and go about the rest of your routine naked. Advance to being naked while you’re eating, while you’re cleaning, and especially while you’re relaxing, be it in front of the TV, with a good book or sunning in your backyard.


If you exercise at home, do it naked, unless it's uncomfortable not to wear a sports bra.
Remember to respect others' boundaries when it comes to nudity. When you're naked in your house, keep the blinds and curtains closed. Don't sunbathe nude in the yard unless you have a high privacy fence.
 Being naked in a nonsexual way with your partner may take your intimacy to the next level, plus it means you'll be able to stay naked when he or she is in the house. Discuss whether this is something you could explore together. If your partner isn't into it, ask if he or she would be comfortable with you doing it by yourself.

, Your character will pause and bend over to write a message on the ground. A menu will then pop up with the options "Write Message", "Rate Message" and "View Your Messages".
 You will have options of what to write, such as "Be wary of..." or "Try...". Select an opening statement and you can then select how to finish it, for example "Be wary of... tough enemy" or "Try luring it out".
 Your message can now be seen in other worlds and other players can view, rate and take advice from your tip.



By selecting "Rate Message", you will be able to rate the last message you read. If the message was a good tip, you can rate it and give it a positive score, meaning more people will have confidence in that message. However, if the last message you read was a lie or misleading, you can rate it down to a maximum score of zero, showing other players that it cannot be trusted.
By selecting "View Your Messages" you can manage your own messages, no matter where you are. You can choose to remove them, see their rating and where they are. You can also view your messages individually by walking over them and also remove them by this method.
 Or if you would prefer, you can choose to mislead other players by writing false tips. Whatever you choose, you now know how to write messages using the orange guidance soapstone and communicate with others in the game.

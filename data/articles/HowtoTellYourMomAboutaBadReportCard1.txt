 Parents appreciate honesty, especially about something as important as your grades. Avoiding this conversation will make you anxious and will likely frustrate her. Try to have a talk with her shortly after you receive your report card.


Approach her when she is not busy, stressed, or in a bad mood.
Don’t forget, your mom might have access to your grades online. This means she might already know about your bad grades and is waiting for you to approach her.;
, Starting off a conversation with great news is a good tactic. Before you address your bad grades, tell your mom how well you did in other class. You could even explain why you performed so well in these courses. Alternatively, you could let your mom know that you cleaned your room, mowed the lawn, or made a sports team.


For example, you might say: “Mom, I ended up with an A in English! I connected really well with the material and my teacher” or "Mom, I know you've been really busy, so I picked up the kitchen and cleaned the bathrooms for you.", Once you’ve softened the blow with your success, let your mom know about the classes you performed poorly in. In addition to telling her the letter grade, explain why you did poorly in the class.


For example, you might say: “While I did great in English, I struggled this semester in my math class. My final grade was a D+. I did great on the homework and in-class assignments, but the tests were overwhelming. My teacher did not offer retakes.”
Avoid making excuses., Even though you can’t change your final grade, you want to demonstrate to your mom that you will try harder next time. Potential solutions include:


Retaking the course with a different instructor
Hiring a tutor
Attending summer school or a credit recovery program
Managing your time better
Avoiding classes that your friends are in

Create the first tail by drawing wavy lines on its end, the second tail by drawing a small trapezoid shape, the third tail a round triangle and then the fourth tail in a form of a “V” with wavy patterns at its end.
 Draw their fins by creating swaying shapes, round shapes, zigzag shapes and wavy ends.
 Draw only one eye since only one side of their body is being shown. Create their eyes by drawing a series of circles and then place a border of curve lines beside it.
 May it be thin or thick crescent shapes, circles or more wavy lines; the catch is to make each one different from each other.

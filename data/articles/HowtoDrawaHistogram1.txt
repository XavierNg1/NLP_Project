 These are the vertical and horizontal lines that form basic outline of the histogram. If you have trouble making the right angle where the axes meet, go ahead and cheat: use a corner of a sheet of paper!;
, In a histogram, the data is visualized in groups. These groups are evenly distributed, so you'll need to make set marks along your lower axis.


For example: 0-4 apples, 5-9 apples, 10-14 apples, etc at 1", 2", and 3" along the axis.
 The vertical axis in a histogram is always for frequency. What measure of time is necessary, though, is up to your data of course (but the numbers will still need to be equally spaced). Just be sure to leave extra room at the top to make your chart easier to read.


If the upper limit of your histogram is 54, for example, you should make the highest number on the axis 60.
If the frequency doesn't start until a fairly high number, you can cut out many of the numbers below it. For example, if the first frequency is 32, you can start the chart at 25 or 30.
 Draw the horizontal top line for each interval or group lightly, at the level that data was measured. Then, draw in the bars centered over the data point they represent. Make sure the bars are even and the same width as each other. Generally, histogram bars are supposed to touch, but if you have no results for a particular group, then don't worry about it.
 Add different colors to the histogram rectangles with colored pencils, markers, or crayons to help differentiate among the intervals.

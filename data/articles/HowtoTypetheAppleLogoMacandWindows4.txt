 To do so, you must have first inserted the logo by pressing ⌥ Option + ⇧ Shift + K as detailed in the previous method. After typing the logo into a text field, highlight it and press ⌘ Command + C (or right-click your mousepad and select "Copy"). You can also consult typing an Apple icon for further details.


Note that this method isn't radically different from using Mac's built-in key combination. It will simply allow you to adjust which combination of keys is associated with the Apple logo, potentially making the process easier depending on a user's preferences.
 Begin by opening System Preferences from your Dock or the Applications section of Finder. Then select Keyboard and click on the Text tab.
 First click on the plus symbol (+) near the bottom of the window. Next, add your preferred keyboard shortcut under the "Replace" field and paste the previously copied Apple logo next to it in the "With" field. You may paste either by pressing ⌘ Command + P or by right-clicking your mousepad and selecting "Paste." Finally, close System Preferences, and you'll now be able to insert the Apple logo using your key combination of choice.

 Stand the pepper on its point. Using a large, sharp knife (chef's knife, etc.), cut straight down through the base of the stem and to the point, splitting the pepper.
 With the point of the knife (a paring knife is probably easier for this part), cut around where the stem part meets the flesh, and discard the stem.
 With the knife or your fingers, cut or pull out all the whitish ribs.
 Bang the pepper halves, open-end down, on the cutting board or your open hand.
 Lay the pepper skin-side down, with the point end toward you. With your knife and off-hand in the usual position, knuckles guiding blade, cut in strips.
 Turn the strips 90 degrees on the board and cut as before.









This method is faster than the previous one, but it's also less delicate. You can't get the peel off fully, for one thing. In addition, this method will tend to break the flesh here and there a little bit.

 It is common behavioral interview practice for the recruiters to ask follow-up questions that explore the situation in more detail. The recruiters want to use the example as a stepping-off point for understanding the way that you work. Thus: make sure that you've used an example that you can talk about in greater detail.


The recruiter might say, "Tell me why you did that," or "Can you explain what was going through your head at that moment?"
Follow-up questions might ask you to explain the long-term consequences of your example action. You may wind up explaining much more about the role in which the example took place.
 Prepare complete and actual examples of behaviors that you know relate to the position. The follow-up questions will request you to explain the situation in great detail. Indeed, they are designed to root out answers that have been fabricated. If you haven't thought your answer through, then the recruiters may dismiss the example as a fake.
 Own your successes and your failures. Even if the example that you used was a great "success" from your professional career, the follow-up questions might prompt you to explain other similar situations in which you were not so successful. Try to own your mistakes and frame them as learning experiences. Show that you can handle both good and bad situations in a mature way.

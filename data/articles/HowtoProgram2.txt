 Lots of colleges and universities have programming degrees or certification programs. This will be the best way to learn as you will have a teacher who can answer all your questions and help you learn key skills in the correct order. A programming degree can also help you get lots of jobs very easily, as it is a skill that is very much in demand.
 There are a number of online universities that you can attend for a fee or for free. These sometimes may not offer degrees but will offer the same amount of education. If you pay tuition, you should generally expect that a degree will be offered.


Good free online university programs in computer programming include MIT’s OpenCourseware and Coursera.
 There are several companies who offer help with programming, especially since they are very reliant on programmers improving their product. Use the resources provided by these companies to learn even more about programming. Examples include Google’s University Consortium and Mozilla’s Developer Network.
 Lots of regular people have lessons in programming available on their own personal websites as well. These can be really useful for learning how to do specific things in a variety of programming languages.
 There are even a number of programs designed to help kids learn programming. Since programming is really just another language, they’ll have an easy time picking it up while they’re still young. Avoid kits, as these don’t really teach anything, but programs like MIT’s Scratch can be very helpful.

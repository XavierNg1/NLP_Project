 Internships are an ideal way to gain hands on research experience during your studies. Academic, industrial, and government research laboratories offer such programs to undergraduate students across the U.S.; this experience offers students an advantage when applying for competitive graduate programs. Contact the Society of Toxicology’s head office for information about available internships near you, or speak to an academic advisor at your university.For example, the Toxicology Lab of the Medical Examiner’s office of Philadelphia offers summer, fall, and spring internships to qualified undergraduate students of affiliated local universities. During these internships, students spend at least 18 weeks in the lab learning safety procedures, sample analysis, and finalization of toxicology reports., Reading up on current trends and issues in the field of toxicology is good way to strengthen your knowledge of the study and its subspecialties, such as chemical carcinogenesis and neurotoxicology. Reading academic journals is also an excellent way to keep abreast of scientific developments in this sector. Look online for peer-reviewed journals (i.e. journals publishing content that has been reviewed by experts in the field) related to toxicology.The Journal of Clinical Toxicology, for example, is a good place to start.
 Attending a lecture pertaining to your studies is a valuable opportunity to garner insight and individual perspective from an expert in the field. As a burgeoning field of study, toxicology has the potential for the development of many unique hypotheses, and lectures are an interactive way for academics to share their work with their colleagues and contemporaries. Look at your university’s website, as well as other local universities, to see upcoming lectures that might interest you.If live lectures aren’t an option, visit the Society of Toxicology’s website to watch video recordings of lectures delivered at events held by the organization.

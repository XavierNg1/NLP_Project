 Before you begin washing your doll's hair, make sure you remove all of the doll's clothing. You do not want to accidentally damage a doll's clothes during the washing process. You should also remove any hair clips or accessories in a doll's hair. These can sometimes be easy to overlook, so comb through a doll's hair first to remove any hair ties., Once you've prepared the doll, find the right product to use in its hair. The type of product you use depends on the type of doll.


For a Barbie doll, use a mild conditioner and gentle soap. For shampoo, it's best to use baby shampoo. If you have a doll with similar hair to a Barbie doll, consider using these products in that situation as well.If your doll is older and its hair is damaged, consider using a gentle fabric softener. This will help clean out the doll's hair and can also help restore its glow and softness. It can also remove odors that have built up in a doll's hair over time.In general, using mild products work best. Doll's hair is far more delicate than human hair, so a gentler shampoo or conditioner is ideal.
 Once you've chosen your product, prepare the water. Most people recommend water that is either cold or lukewarm. Hot water can be damaging to a doll's hair.









Stir in a small amount of the product you are using.Mix the product into the water., Dip your doll in the water. Gently lather the shampoo into the doll's hair. As you go, try to work out any knots or tangles you notice along the way. If your doll's hair is particularly dirty, consider letting the doll sit in the water for 10 minutes.








If you're using fabric softener to restore old doll hair, the process is slightly different. You should fill a small bowl or basin with as much softener as you need to coat the doll's hair. Place the doll's hair in the bowl and cover the hair until its soaked in softener. Then, let the doll sit for 20 minutes.

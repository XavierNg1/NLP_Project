 In order to create a new playlist, you’ll need to load a video that you want to add.
 This is located on the same line as the Like button and the About and Share tabs.
 If you’ve ever set a video as a Favorite or to Watch Later, you will see these playlists as options. You can also type in the name of a new playlist to add the video to.


When creating a new playlist, you have the option to make that playlist Public, Private, or Unlisted. Public playlists can be seen and searched by anyone, while private playlists are only available to users you designate. Unlisted playlists can be accessed by anyone who has the direct URL to the playlist.
You can choose to add the new video to the top of the playlist instead of the bottom by checking the box above the playlist selection.
 Once you have a playlist with a few videos in it, you’re probably going to want to start shuffling the order around. Click the Playlists button on the left-hand navigation menu, and then click the playlist you want to organize.


Once you’ve opened the playlist, click the “Edit playlist” button at the top of the page.
Click and drag the tabs on the left side of each playlist entry to move the order around.

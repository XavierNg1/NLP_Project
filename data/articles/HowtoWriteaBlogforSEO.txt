 For example, if you manage a blog about traveling to Italy, you will probably have a regular list of keywords that you use in each post. But for a post specifically about day trips from Rome, you’ll want to use a second set of keywords that are unique to that subject.


Websites like Google Insights can help you figure out which keywords are the most popular for your blog post topic.;
, The title should match as closely as possible to the exact search terms people use when looking for information. It should be succinct, clear and helpful.


Good: Rome Day Trips
Bad: Some Places You Can Go That Are Close To Rome

, This helps the spiders further determine how relevant your site is. This article is actually a good example of this step; while it mentions Rome day trips, the title and the first paragraph tell the algorithm to categorize it under SEO tips and not under Italian travel.
 Write as you normally would, making sure to include keywords and phrases where they make the most sense.
 Again, this tells the spiders that the post is still relevant, and has not veered off course into another subject. You want to reiterate the point of the post, and use plenty of your relevant keywords.
 These are some other things you can do to optimize your blog post:


Tag your post with the relevant keywords. Up to about 5 tags are best; use exact keyword phrasing for best results.
Use the “alt tag” on photos that include your keywords. This is the little message that appears when you hover your mouse over a photo. Some people like to include funny messages, but it’s a great opportunity for more keywords. You can do this at the point in which you upload photos.
Link to other sites, and previous posts on your own site, where relevant. One of the things search engines look for when determining relevancy is how many sites link to yours, and how many you link to.

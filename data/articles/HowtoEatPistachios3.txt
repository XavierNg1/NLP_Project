 Keep a separate bowl for shells. Move the hardest pistachios onto a sturdy plate for cracking.
 These nuts are small and low-calorie, but they are rich with flavor and nutrients. A handful of pistachios can help ward off hunger pangs, which might come in handy during prolonged activity. Furthermore, the nut is a great source of protein and fiber.
 Pistachios are packed with nutritional value, but they contain many fewer calories than fat-rich nuts like walnuts and macadamias. Try incorporating more pistachios into your diet if you are trying to lose weight, or if you're just trying be more mindful about your nut consumption.


One pistachio contains 3-4 calories, on average. Some dietitians suggest a daily portion of 30 grams, or about 49 pistachios â€“ which translates to roughly160 calories. In comparison, an equivalent portion of walnuts contains 190 calories, and the same portion of macadamia nuts contains 200 calories.
 Use a blender, a mortar and pestle, or any food-grade grinder. You can mix the nut powder into smoothies, sprinkle it into your cereal, and even use it as a baking ingredient. If you are blending the pistachios into a smoothie anyway, you can leave them whole and add them directly to the mix.

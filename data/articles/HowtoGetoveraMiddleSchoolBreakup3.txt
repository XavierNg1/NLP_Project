 Breakups often interfere with the ability to take care of yourself; after a breakup, many people lose sleep, have reduced appetites and feel depressed, and some people even have suicidal thoughts. Make sure you eat enough, get 7-8 hours of sleep, and drink enough water.
 Your friends and family are your support network and they'd love to spend time with you! Hang out, talk and even plan a fun activity that all of you enjoy. This could be a valuable distraction from thoughts of your ex.
 Whether it's eating at your favorite restaurant, chatting with an old friend or taking a walk, bath or shower, doing something you love will definitely help you to enjoy your life again.

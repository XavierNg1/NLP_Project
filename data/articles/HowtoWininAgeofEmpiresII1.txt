 Villagers are key to a great economy. Villagers gather resources which can be used to build, create, and research stuff later on in the game. The trick is to have enough villagers to support what you are trying to accomplish at the time.;
, These sheep should then be moved under the town center so the villagers have an instant drop off point and don't need to run to drop the food off. Six villagers is the optimum to have on sheep at any one time. It will insure constant villager production. You should now use the next created villager to build a lumber camp and the next 2 villagers should go there too. The berries should be close to the town center, the next 2 villagers should be sent to berries as well for a total of 4. You then want to send some more villagers to wood and a few more to sheep, remember to create one or two far before you click to feudal.

Since you need to know the map, the scout is vital. Start by scouting around your base in a circle then when you have found everything you need, 6+ sheep, gold, stone and at least one decent lumber site start scouting for your opponent, a good starting point is directly across from you.
 You shouldn't drop villager production unless you are going full aggressive, or have 120 villagers (In 200 pop)

, A good player won't research loom until he is about to go feudal. However, if you don't have the food to create a villager it can be a good time to do loom. Also if your boar is far away, or the game is laggy it can be a good idea to get loom before you lure it.

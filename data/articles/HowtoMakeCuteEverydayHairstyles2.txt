 You don't have to reserve putting your hair into a bun for special occasions. Here are some ways to wear it in everyday manner.
 After you've put your hair into a ponytail, twisted it, and wrapped it around the base, you can fasten your bun with another non-rubber elastic (or two), or some bobby pins. Bobby pins offer a little more control, where elastics can make the base of the bun look smaller. Do whatever works best for you.
 A very neat, structured bun is usually referred to as a ballet bun, because it's favored by classical dancers. To do this, comb hair thoroughly, make tight twists, and use hairspray. You can also do a messier look, twisting and pinning your hair in a more haphazard way. A messy bun works well on curly or wavy hair.
 As with ponytails, a bun can be worn high on your head, at the nape of your neck, or at any intermediate point.
 If you choose to do a side bun, keep it low and positioned just behind your ear - a high side bun creates an awkward profile.
 If you have layers, bangs (fringe) or just want a less structured look, choose a few pieces at the top or side of your face to leave out of your bun. These can be curled, straightened, or just left as they are.
 Tie your hair back in a ponytail. Braid or plait it. Secure it from the bottom. Twirl it around the beginning of your braid or plait into a bun position. Secure with bobby pins or clutch.

 You can use a spoon, fork, or toothpick to get it out. Crush it into a fine powder using a spoon or fork. Make sure that there are no clumps or chunks, or your lip gloss will turn out grainy.









For a shimmery lip gloss, use an eyeshadow or blush that already has some sparkle to it.
 Use something thin, like a chopstick or toothpick. Keep stirring until everything is evenly combined. There should be no streaks, swirls, chunks, or clumps.

You can find small containers in the paint section of an art store. They are meant for storing excess paint, but they make great lip gloss containers.
You can also use empty lip gloss containers, clean contact lens cases, and pill boxes as well.
 If you are in a rush, leave it in the fridge for a few hours until it hardens. You can apply it using your finger or a q-tip.

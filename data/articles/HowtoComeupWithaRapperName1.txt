 Your rapper name may sound fairly different depending on where you come from and what sort of rapping you do. Your name should reflect how you want to come across: dangerous, or goofy, or thoughtful, or clever. Think about your identity.


Consider the sorts of names that other rappers in your area use. You don't need to copy anyone else â€“ but you might be wise to get familiar with the "scene" that you want to break into.;
, Include the first letter of your name, or twist your name into something entirely different. Make your rapper name something that sounds like your real name, but differs enough to distinguish you. There is no right or wrong way to do this. Get creative!


Consider Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers. His rapper name is based on his initials: "M and M."Lil Wayne's real name is Dwayne Michael Carter. He just took the "D" out of Dwayne to make it Wayne!, Snoop Dogg's mother was the one to bestow him with his rapper name: Snoopy (of Peanuts fame) was his favorite cartoon character growing up, and his mother started calling him after the character. When Snoop got into the rap game, he decided to use his childhood nickname to give himself a unique stage presence.

 To use the nasal rinse, you have to be near a sink or some other place that can catch the dirty water.


The water will travel into one nostril and out the other, so make sure it has somewhere to go.
 Draw about 4ml of nasal rinse into a bulb or syringe to prepare for administration.


Make sure that whatever you are using to administer the rinse is clean and disinfected.
 Tilt your head to the left to provide a good angle for drainage.


Place the syringe or bulb on your right nostril, creating a seal.
Slowly press the syringe or the bulb to release the rinse.
Always breathe through your mouth while using the nasal rinse, to prevent it from entering your throat.
It will pass into your right nostril and run out of your other nostril, flushing out mucous, dust, and pollen.
After doing this, blow your nose unless your doctor indicates otherwise.
This procedure will loosen the mucus that is inside the nose.
Repeat this at least 2 to 3 times a day until for 2 days.
 Discard the solution after one day's use and make a fresh one to avoid any contamination.


Also, clean the bulb syringe after every use.
 You should avoid using a nasal rinse if:


You have an ear infection
You are administering the rinse to babies or kids under 6 years of age.
You have a nasal polyp.

 Don’t use soap and don’t rub your face with a washcloth, as the skin on your face is usually very thin and irritates easily. Instead, gently splash the cold water on your face.
 The cold will help shrink blood vessels and allow the cut to stop bleeding.


Eye drops such as Visine may have a similar effect., While “shaving nick balms” are available for purchase, basic lip balm works as well. These products help seal the cut and prevent it from getting infected. Allow this to dry for a few minutes.Use an unflavored, uncolored lip balm for best results. You can also use unscented petroleum jelly.
 Pick a concealer that’s either the same shade as your skin or a shade lighter.


Use a q-tip or liner brush to gently dab concealer onto the center of the cut.
Blend the concealer by dabbing the brush onto the cut, or use your finger to blend the concealer outwards towards the edges.
Set the concealer with powder. Pick a translucent or colorless powder so that you don’t draw extra attention to the area. Use a puff or powder brush to dab the powder over the cut, then blend using sweeping circular motions.

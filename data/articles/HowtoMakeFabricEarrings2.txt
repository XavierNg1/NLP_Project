 Don't worry about the color; you can always paint it. Instead, look for a thickly-embroidered design that appeals to you. Lace found in the bridal section and in the trim section of a fabric store would be ideal.
 Some may have a scrolled design instead. Take a look at your lace, and find a section of the design that you use best. Use a pair of fabric scissors to it out.


Cut through the fine mesh that's around the embroidered design. Avoid cutting right across an embroidered design.
Cut out two identical designs, one for each earring.
 Paint one side with fabric stiffener and let it dry. Flip the lace over, and paint the other side. This will help stiffen the lace and add some "weight" to it.


If you don't have any fabric stiffener at home, use a decoupage glue instead.
 If you are using fabric paint or acrylic paint, consider watering it down first, and applying it in several thin layers. This way, you won't loose the embroidered design.


Paint one side first, let it dry, then paint the other side.
 Depending on the products you used, this could take only a few minutes to several hours. Refer to the label on your bottle of stiffener and paint for more specific drying instructions.
 Use a pair of needle nose pliers to twist open the loop at the bottom of an earring hook. Do not pull the loop open, as this can weaken the metal.
 Slip the loop you just opened through the lace, close to the edge.
 Use your needle nose pliers to twist the loop back shut, sealing the lace inside. If there is a small gap between the end of the loop and the earring hook, use your needle nose plies to pinch it shut.

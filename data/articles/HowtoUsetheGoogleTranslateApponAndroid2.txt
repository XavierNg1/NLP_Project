 It looks like a white blue and white folded piece of paper with the letter “A” in the left blue side, and the corresponding Japanese character in the right white side. If you don’t have Translate installed, you can download it for free from the Google Play Store.
 Along the bottom of the white text box are icons corresponding the different modes you can use. Tap the Camera icon on the leftmost end of the icon row to initiate the camera.
 In Camera mode, you will see an overlay in the middle of the screen telling you to align the text with the rectangle. Make sure the text is right inside the rectangle to ensure that the translation is accurate.


Make sure that the text you are trying to translate is clear, in print font, and that you have good lighting conditions for optimal accuracy.
You can switch the languages in the top portion of the screen, and tapping on the arrows icon in the middle will swap the languages.
Once properly aligned, you will see the text translated into the target language.
 In Camera mode, you can tap the Scan icon in the lower right corner to take a picture of the text or sign, and after a few seconds, it will display the picture with the text replaced with the translated versions.
 If you’ve already taken a picture of a sign using your regular camera app, you can tap the “Import” button at the lower left corner to browse your device’s storage and select a picture to scan. Tap the picture to select it, and the app will scan the text in the picture and then display it in the selected language.

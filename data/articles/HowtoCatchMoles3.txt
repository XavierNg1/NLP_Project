 A new tunnel or mound will most likely have a mole digging through rather frequently. You can spot newer mounds by finding fresh, piles of dirt on your property. Consequently, tunnels will lead away from the mound, so feel for softer grass areas extending away from the mound. Check on the tunnel or mound frequently during the early morning or evening to see if you notice any movement just underneath the surface of the soil.Moles tend to do most of their digging during the early morning and evening, so this is the best time to look out for them.
 Wait and watch the tunnel or mound to see movement as the mole digs through. When you see movements, approach the tunnel or mound very slowly so as not to alert the mole.Be sure you are wearing protective gloves before attempting this method. You will have to handle the mole with your hands, and don’t want the mole to bite you.
 Strike a spade or shovel deep into the ground (about 6 to 8 inches or 15 to 20 centimeters deep) behind the mole.Striking the spade or shovel behind the mole will prevent it from escaping as you try to remove them from the ground. When you have successfully spaded the mole out of the ground, quickly grab the mole with your hands and place it in a bucket for disposal later. Do not let the mole burrow it’s way back into the ground after you have spaded it from the dirt.


This can be a humane way to remove moles from your yard, but it can leave large holes and divots in your grass.However, there’s also the chance that you may accidentally miss the dirt surrounding the mole, and injure the animal., Contact your local animal services agency for advice and instruction on where and how to release your captured moles. As mentioned before, there may be property restrictions along with humane and ethical disposal restrictions that can play a factor in the manner of disposing the moles.

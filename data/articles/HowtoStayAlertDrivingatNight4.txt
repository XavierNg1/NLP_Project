 Some of the most telling signs that you’re unfit to drive will manifest in your eyes and gestures. Switch up your alertness methods—for example, if you’re listening to audiobook, try switching to an amped-up CD or radio station—if you experience difficulty focusing, excessive blinking, or yawning. These symptoms indicate unsafe levels of fatigue and could lead to more serious issues more quickly than you realize.Detecting these early signs of exhaustion is particularly important because the next step of fatigue—characterized by memory lapses, disorientation, and slowed reactions—is already a dangerous state of impairment which causes thousands of traffic accidents every year., If you catch yourself drifting into the median or shoulder, slamming on the brakes due to a delayed reaction, or missing a stop sign, you are already experiencing dangerous symptoms of over-tired driving. You may not have taken any drugs or alcohol, but that doesn’t mean you aren’t impaired. You should pull over immediately and try to take a cat nap to refresh your energy.If you still feel extremely sleepy after your cat nap, don’t try to force it and continue on the road. Quit while you’re ahead and get a good night’s sleep before resuming your drive.
 There are times when even the utmost vigilance, quantities of caffeine, and other alertness tricks simply won't work. If you feel sleepy and strained in spite of all your attempts to perk yourself up, you need to throw in the towel and sleep. Find a hotel, motel, or rest area where you can sleep for a few hours before continuing your drive.If you’re going to stop somewhere, be sure to call a friend or family member to let them know exactly where you are and how long you plan to sleep. That way someone knows where you are and you won’t alarm anyone expecting your arrival.

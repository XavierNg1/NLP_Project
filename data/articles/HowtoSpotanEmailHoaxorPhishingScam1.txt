 Email hoaxes are often termed "phishing". This term refers to the instances where the scammer sends out a mass email to every address he or she has managed to glean by whatever method. The hope is that at least a few people will be gullible enough within that mass emailing to respond––and send cash or personal details.;
, In a nutshell, they want cash or identifying information that can give them access to sources of cash. They hope that they can trick people into revealing sensitive personal information such as passwords to accounts, banking information, Social Security numbers, mother’s maiden name, date of birth, among others. Phishing scams are targeted to gather personal information in order to hijack your assets or steal your identity to open credit accounts in your name.


Social media is another form of scamming. Fake Facebook, Twitter, etc. accounts can be used to present a front that seems genuine, only to disappear when the fraud has been committed, no traces left.

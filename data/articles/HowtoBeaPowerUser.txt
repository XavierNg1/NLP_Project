If you must use a GUI read on to the next step. But the efficiency advantages of the CLI are as follows.


If you need to move all folders ending with "photos" this is easy in the command line but difficult and slow in a GUI.






Command-line completion is also known as tab-completion and can speed things up.






Pipe command-line output into other commands if needed.






Shell aliases can be set in Linux.

, Most systems use floating window managers where windows aren't automatically aligned and can overlap one another. If you spend a lot of time moving, resizing, maximizing, minimizing, restoring and generally switching windows then a tiling window manager might be for you. A TWM presents multiple windows on one screen aligned in a tile formation. The following is the manifesto of Ion, a dynamic tiling window manager with tabs for each frame."So-called “modern desktop environments” converge on total unusability, and present-day mainstream graphical user interfaces in general are far less usable than they are praised to be. Usability simply does not equal low learning curve, and hiding system details from the user, as the Official Truth seems to be these days."

, Strokeit (Windows), Opera (Cross platform), gMote (Windows), Easystroke (Linux), Mouse Gestures Redox (Firefox) are all applications.
 You won't become a programmer, but scripts help to automate common repetitive tasks. In Windows they're sometimes called batch files.

If you need to copy photos until you reach a certain number of megabytes, a script is needed.






Use browser scripts. Greasemonkey, iMacros and Chickenfoot are some on Firefox. Opera supports user javascript.
 Also known as Commander-like, Midnight Commander is one for command-line users. Alternatively use something like Directory Opus, as long as you don't use a basic (usually bundled) file manager. Again, it is all about key bindings, so learn the keyboard shortcuts.

Organize your audio and images with appropriate software designed for this purpose.






Don't use a word-processor where a decent plain text editor will do. Use Regular Expressions. Where you don't need to format documents, use plain text.

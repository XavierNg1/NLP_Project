 Cut out six chiffon flower shapes, following the paper pattern.
Overlay the six chiffon flowers. Aim to layer so that the petals of each underlying layer peek through the gaps of the next layer; this will provide a fuller look.






Sew all the layers of flowers together at the center. This is simple in and out sewing, nothing fancy!






Tie a firm knot to keep the stitching in place. Trim off any excess thread above the knot.



The final action is to add a hair clip at the back of the chiffon flower. Stitch or glue the clip firmly in place at the back of the chiffon flower accessory.






Done! You now have a beautiful chiffon flower accessory ready for wearing.

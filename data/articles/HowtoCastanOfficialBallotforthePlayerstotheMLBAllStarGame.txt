 They won't let you continue, until you do. Type your email address in the top box, click the drop-downs to select your birth-date, and type your ZIP-code. Fill in the right hand reCaptcha image on the page.


If you just get a response back asking you to type a new reCaptcha image although the answer provided is 100% correct, wait 24 hours (especially if you got notification it's there on April 30th) as the system isn't ready to accept your ballot yet.

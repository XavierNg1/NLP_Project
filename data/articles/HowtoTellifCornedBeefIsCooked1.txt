 According to the US Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service, you should not cook at less than 325 degrees Fahrenheit., You can cook the corned beef similar to how you cook a turkey, in order to seal in the juices.


If you are using a bag, you should add 1 tbsp. of flour to the bag and shake it around before adding the brisket.
Place the bagged corned beef brisket on a cooking sheet.
 Roasting the brisket with some water will give you more chances to check for doneness, although some of the natural juices will escape with the dry heat.


Always cook with the fat side up.
Fill the lower pan with water. It should cover approximately 1 inch (2.5cm) of the bottom of the brisket.
Adding water will improve the moisture of the meat.
Cover the roasting pan. If you do not have a cover, you can use foil to keep the moisture inside.
 The following instructions should help you ensure the corned beef will be done in time for dinner.


If you are using a bag, cook for 2.5 to 3 hours for a 2 to 3 lb (0.9 to 1.4kg) brisket. Cook for 3.5 hours for a 3.5 to 5 lb (1.6 to 2.3kg) brisket.
If you are using the roasting pan method, cook for 1 hour per lb. (0.5kg) of meat.
 Set it on the stovetop and remove it from the bag, if necessary.
 If the internal temperature has reached 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius), you can remove it from the heat source and serve it.


Aim for an internal temperature between 145 and 160 degrees Fahrenheit (63 to 71 degrees Celsius).

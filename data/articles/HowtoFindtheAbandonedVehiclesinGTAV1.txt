 It is on a road directly south and center of the Sandy Shores Airfield. The vehicle will only be there between the hours of 7PM and 8AM. The vehicle will appear to be unoccupied, since the windows are dark, but there is an enemy inside.;
, There are three ways in which this random event can be completed: shoot and kill the enemy, let yourself be captured by them, or flee. Each of the possible actions require that you first leave your vehicle. This event will take place quickly, so determine your preferred course of action and be prepared.


To shoot and kill the person, you must be playing as Trevor and use his special ability to become invulnerable. If you successfully kill the enemy before they shoot you with the Stun Gun, you will get to pick the gun up and keep it for yourself. You will also be able to collect the $20 they drop.
If you do not shoot and kill the person in time, they will shoot you with the Stun Gun. There is no reward for completing the event this way.
Fleeing will not result in a reward, but it will save you from being shot by the Stun Gun.
 Activate Trevor’s special ability, then shoot and kill the enemy if that’s the action you want to take. Afterward, walk over to their body to collect the Stun Gun and money. If you decide to flee instead, wait for a red dot to appear on your minimap, indicating that the random event has been triggered. Once that happens, quickly get back into your vehicle and drive away. Otherwise, wait for the person to shoot you with the Stun Gun if you decide to complete the event that way.


If you are shot by the Stun Gun, you will wake up eight hours later on train tracks, with a train coming at you. You will only have a few seconds to move out of the way of the train. However, if you are run over by the train, the random event will still be considered complete.If you were shot by the Stun Gun, your vehicle will still be parked where the random event took place.

 Understand addition, subtraction, and division. A little shop trigonometry is good for calculating bolt circles and finding the length of triangles. Some basic algebra can also be handy for applying handbook formulas.;
, Suitable skills are included in vocational and technical schools' machining programs. Learn to create and interpret mechanical drawings.
 As an apprentice, you will do simple tasks like drilling, deburring, and sweeping in the beginning. The tasks will become more challenging as time goes on. You will learn the lathe, mill and surface grinder. Apprenticeships typically last 2 to 4 years.
 Programs vary from school to school. Make sure you are studying at one that has various machines to learn from. A wire EDM (electrostatic discharge machining) tool would be nice. Also, make sure they have good CNC (computer numerically controlled) programming courses. Try to get hands-on experience in a shop rather than studying only in a classroom. The heart of your education will be in the types of projects you will be making in the course. A typical machine tool technology program will last two years.
 This is an excellent reference for answering any machining problem.
 An electronic caliper is a plus also.


Try to stay away from generic tools because these seem to be less durable. Instead, invest in high quality tools like Starrett and Mitutoyo, top names in the trade.
If money is tight, obtain tools gradually, as you need them, over time, until you have your own set. Get the ones you need most first.
 Learn from veteran tool and die makers. They can and often do share many tips they have learned over the years.
,, A Bachelor's degree in almost any field along with tool and die experience would be very beneficial in obtaining a supervisor's job in manufacturing and/or teaching.

 Speedroids can fit into almost any WIND deck, and let you make fast synchro plays and Rank 3 Xyz summons. The basic Speedroid engine is 3 Terrortop and 1-2 Taketomborg, though you can include 1 Tri-Eyed Dice or a few Speed Rebirth.;
, This will give you many cards to put in your WIND deck.
 Buy 1 more from some other source.
 This is not the same card in your structure deck. Keep this card in mind when you make your deck and include some level 5-6 WIND monsters to summon, like "Swift birdman Joe"

, Add at least 1 "Spiritual wind art Miyabi"

, Recommended are Harpie lady 1 especially, which will support your other WIND monsters. Use "Elegant Egotist" as well, but DO NOT use Harpie lady sisters.
 Try to get the synchro monster "Mist Wurm" which will go well with your deck. You can use "Mist Valley Thunderbird" for the effect of Mist valley shaman as well. Fill the rest of your extra deck with basic synchro monsters which require 1 tuner + 1 or more non tuners

, Since a lot of "splash-able" and "staple monsters" are DARK (Like sangan, breaker the magical warrior and gorz the emissary of darkness), you can try to include "Dark Simorgh", which will be very powerful but also very expensive. You can get it if you think you can afford it.
 You can include some from your structure deck, recommended are "Bladefly", "Silpheed" and "sonic shooter." You can also use Lady Ninja Yae + Gravity Bind and Level Limit area b to control your opponent's attacks until you use her effect. If you go this route, you can also include "Tornado Bird" and "Sonic Jammer", along with some "Book of Moon" for re-using the flip effects.

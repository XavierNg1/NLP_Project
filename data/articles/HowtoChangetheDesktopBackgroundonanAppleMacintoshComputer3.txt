 This method describes the process for Photos and iPhoto.Other photo applications may not have this option.


This process has been confirmed for iPhoto 9.5 and later.Older versions of iPhoto may have a different user interface.
 This photo must be saved to your computer, not stored in an iCloud library or on a camera. You can drag it to your desktop to save it.


On some versions of the application, you may select multiple photos, or an entire album. This will cause your desktop to cycle through all selected images.
 Click the Share button in the top right corner. (This looks like a box with a vertical arrow.) Select "Set Desktop Picture."


Continue on to display options if you'd like to tweak how the image fits your screen.
 Some users prefer to move all their desktop pictures to one folder, and manage them from System Preferences. You can "drag and drop" the photo to your desktop to make a copy, but this may lower the quality. Try this instead:


In Photos, select the image you want, then choose File → Export → Export Unmodified Original.In iPhoto, right-click (Control-click) on the image and select "Show File" to reveal the file in Finder. Alternatively, use File → Reveal in Finder → Original.

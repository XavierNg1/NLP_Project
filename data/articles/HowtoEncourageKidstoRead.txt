 Many people have fond memories of their parents reading them bedtime stories, and reading to your child will help foster a love of words and reading.

Reading to a child also models a lot of important things about reading: which way to hold a book, how to turn the pages, and the idea that printed words represent sounds and meanings.
Don't be afraid to ham it up when reading to a child. An extra dose of drama adds interestâ€”and reinforces how words and sentences sound.
As your children learn to read, encourage them to "help" you find letters and sound out words. You can even drop in little lessons, such as, "What other word here sounds like 'tree'? That's right, 'see'. Do you see the tree? What letters make that "ee" sound?"

, Kids who grow up with books all around them learn to think of books as friends and allies in their pursuit of adventure and learning.
 Let them see you reading, and how much you enjoy reading books and magazines.
 Show them how a good book can expand their knowledge in a particular area, and expand their horizons as well.
 While showing your child books is a good way to build their interest level, a child who finds new books on their own can benefit from an increased sense of independence.
 Show them how a library can be a place of wonder and excitement, and can open up whole new worlds of learning to last a lifetime. And then put the library in your schedule, so you will be sure to visit frequently together.
 For example, if your child reads 30 minutes every day for a week, offer to give them their favorite treat.

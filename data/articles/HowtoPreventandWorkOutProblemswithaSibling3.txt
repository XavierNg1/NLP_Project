Take a deep breath, excuse yourself, and leave (if the situation is too intense, or you worry you do not have time to explain, just leave).
Do not go back to the argument until both you (and your sibling) have calmed down, and then some.  Depending on the urgency of resolving the issue, this could be a few minutes, hours, days, or even weeks.  But it is important to resolve the situation (whether by apology or by choosing a verdict).  Do so with an adult, if you feel it is necessary.
Do not stop to retaliate or leave any closing remarks.  It will often only cause trouble.



Go to a place where you feel safe (your bedroom, attic, backyard, the library, park, or even the woods).
Take a few minutes to calm down completely.  You can entertain yourself briefly if that helps.
Congratulate yourself on leaving the situation.
Make a list (mental, on paper, or on an electronic device), of the events that went on in the argument/fight.
Think about what you did that was good, what you did that was not good, and what you did that was somewhere in between.
Ponder what might have happened if you had done things differently.
Make another list of the things you have done wrong.
Wait until you think your sibling has calmed down, and then approach him/her with an apology.  Make sure the apology is sincere, and do not include things in it like, "...but I was really upset..." "...you had pushed me..." or "...but even so..."  These things usually make the apology look like a lecture instead of what it really is.  Remember, this is you admitting your wrongs, not the other way around.
If your sibling does not accept the apology, or does not acknowledge his/her own wrongdoing, leave it.  Prodding them will most likely provoke another argument.

 It should be a definite shade ( this means black, brown, auburn, chestnut, red or blonde, not some drab in-between shade you dyed it two years ago). The straighter the better, though if you have curly hair, keep it beautiful and rock it well!;
, And anyway, flawless skin is fresh, pretty and a sign of youth!

, For your nails, a french manicure is perfect and matches everything. For the toes, a cream red always looks stylish.
 Arch your eyebrows with a good set of tweezers or ask your mom to do it for you. Brush your teeth twice a day and rinse with mouthwash. You'll then create a winning smile!

, NOTICE, HOT, not THIN. Have a curvy figure, (If not, that's fine!). Just remember, God made you beautiful whether you are a pear, apple, petite, pencil or hourglass figure.
 Wear a foundation, concealer and loose powder. Apply blush for warmth. Dust some shimmery brown, gold or bronze eyeshadow onto your lids. Curl your lashes and apply mascara. Apply a thin line of liquid eyeliner to the lash line to make lashes appear thicker. Slick on some gloss. But if you are under fifteen, a tinted moisturizer, mascara and a tinted lip balm will look pretty and give almost the same effect.
 Go to the shops and buy the following items listed in How to Get a Basic Wardrobe (for Girls), plus a leather jacket, Minnetonkas and anything else you feel necessary. A denim jacket does wonders too!

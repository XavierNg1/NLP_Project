 Ghost crabs are common shore crabs in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world. They inhabit deep burrows in the inter-tidal zone. They are particularly popular on the Outer Banks beaches of North Carolina (and ghost crab hunting is a popular activity there), but they can be found on coastal beaches around the world., Ghost crabs are nocturnal, so in order to see them (let alone catch them), you must visit the beach at night. Go to your beach location after the sun has set., Using your flashlight, scan up and down the beach looking for movement. Ghost crabs are small, quick, and the color of sand, so it may be hard to spot them at first. But with your flashlight, you’ll soon begin to see them scurry., Once you have spotted a ghost crab, aim your flashlight right at him. Maybe you’ve heard the expression a “deer stuck in headlights”? Well, how about a crab stuck in a flashlight? When the light is shined on him, he will freeze.
 Keep your flashlight steady and approach him very slowly. Try not to spook him. As soon as you become close enough, scoop him up in your net. Then drop him from your net into your bucket. Congrats! You’ve just caught your first ghost crab.
 Although this activity is often called ghost crab “hunting,” it is really more like ghost crab chasing. Be sure to release your little critters back into the wild after your fun evening of catching them.

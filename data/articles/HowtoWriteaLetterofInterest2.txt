 Your employer should already know your past work experience, but this is a great time to remind them of anything they might have forgotten and to bring up any new skills you've attained by working for them.
 If you have anything in particular that would help you stand out, now is the time to mention it.
 Take your employer through a history of your time at your current job and remind them of your recent accomplishments.

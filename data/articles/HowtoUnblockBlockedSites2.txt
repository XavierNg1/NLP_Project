 These sites can act as a proxy by using them to read a page and then sending a translated version to you.This allows you to access the information on a website without actually visiting.
 Type the address in the field for translating a URL. Select the language you want to translate the site to. You can tell the service to translate it from English to English.
 You will now be able to see the content of the blocked site. This is a great method to keep in mind for situations when you need to access a site and donâ€™t have time to find other solutions.

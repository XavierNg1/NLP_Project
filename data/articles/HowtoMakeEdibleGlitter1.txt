If you wish the edible glitter to be colored, add liquid coloring to the water before you mix the water with the gum arabic. Here are some colors you may want to use:

A little blue will whiten flakes
Yellow mixed with a little orange makes a nice gold hue
No added dyes will give you a silver effect.
 Do this to remove any clumps of gum arabic that may not have been thoroughly incorporated during the mixing.
 Parchment paper can be placed on top of the baking tray to minimize cleanup.

 Allow to cool on a rack for at least 5 minutes afterward.
 Break up with a wooden spoon, for example, or sift through a strainer and store in dry covered container.

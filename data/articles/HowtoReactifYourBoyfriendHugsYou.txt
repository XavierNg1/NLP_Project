 Don't be nervous.;
, If you pull away, especially if you don't touch often, it could be pretty offensive to him. If he puts his arm around you, lean against him. If he hugs you, hug him back. Again, remember that he is your boyfriend!

, Simple hugs are his way of saying, "Hey Babe! Good to see you. In fact, good to be dating you." If you pull away, it is your way of saying, "Um, excuse me? Stay away. Far, far away."

, It can often be stronger than words, because people subconsciously look to body language to figure out what you really say. Even if you talk sweetly to him, he may take it badly if you reject even one hug without explanation. Just think about it: if he walked away from your hug without any reason you can tell, wouldn't it hurt your feelings?

, Face to face is also better). Say something simple, like, "Hey, sorry if I freaked out on you today... I'm not big on hugs." Guys put a lot on touching, so make sure you find something else to make up for it.
 If this is true, say so. Many people, especially from conservative backgrounds, are shy about close contact in public but do not mind in private. Most guys will be more than happy if their girlfriends have no problem with snuggling in private - more time for being alone together!And remember he's your boyfriend the more you hug, the more comfortable you will feel with him!

, Good luck!!

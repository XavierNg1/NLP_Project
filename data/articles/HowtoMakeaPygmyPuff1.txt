 These include:


Yarn (pink or purple traditionally, but you can make your pygmy puff any color you want)
Scissors
Googly eyes or paper and markers
Medium or large glue dots
Red or pink embroidery thread and plastic needle (optional);
, The looser you wrap the yarn, the fluffier and less dense it becomes. A medium density is best because the pygmy puff is firm enough to stand on its own but is still plush and soft. You will wad up some yarn to start, then continue to wrap the yarn around to build it up. Make sure that the pygmy puff looks circular; wrap the yarn repeatedly over an area that bulges to make it look more normal.
 Choose the flattest side of your pygmy puff and make sure the pygmy puff can sit without falling over. Choose googly eyes that aren't too large or small. Attach to the face with glue dots roughly the size of the googly eyes. If you don't have googly eyes, draw eyes on a piece of paper, then cut out and attach. Draw the iris first (the colored part), then the pupil (black), and add a dot with a silver sharpie to imitate light reflecting off the eye. Attach to the pygmy puff with glue dots.
 Pygmy puffs have long, skinny tongues that they use to scavenge for food. You can make your tongue as short as 3 inches or as long as 8 inches. Cut your desired length from either red or pink embroidery thread and make a large knot on one end. Thread the other end through a plastic needle. Push the needle through the center of the pygmy puff, making sure it comes out in a spot you like. Remove the needle from the thread and pull all of the embroidery thread through.


If the tongue is too long, shorten it. To retract the tongue, pull the knot in the back. To lengthen the tongue, pull the thread in the front.

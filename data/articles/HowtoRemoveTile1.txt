 You can consult with a home inspector or asbestos removal company if you don’t have a record of the material. If it does contain asbestos, hire a company to seal off the area and remove it to reduce your risk of harmful inhalants.;
, Put on your kneepads, gloves and glasses. Remember that ceramic tile can cut through skin easily.
 Once the grout is loosened, it will be easier to remove the tile.
 Drive a chisel and a three pound sledgehammer into the center of the tile as hard as you can. It should break the tile.
 The following are the best ways to remove tile depending upon your subflooring.


If the tile is adhered directly on the subfloor you will need to break it back by hand, instead of removing pieces of tile along with the underlayment.
If the underlayment is plywood, use a reciprocating saw and 12 inch (30.5 cm) wood cutting blade to cut through the plywood. Cut the plywood underlayment out and remove it along with the tile.
If the underlayment is cement backer board, use a reciprocating saw with a carbide-grit masonry-cutting blade and remove the backer board with the tile still attached.
Be careful to avoid cutting through the subfloor or you will have to reinstall a new subfloor before you place new flooring down.

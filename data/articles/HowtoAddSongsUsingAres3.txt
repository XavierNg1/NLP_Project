 Ares downloads songs to folders that you specify. The default folder is My Shared Folder on your desktop. Open the folder containing the music that you want to add to your media player.
 Once your media player is open, navigate to your library.
 The songs should be added to your media playerâ€™s library automatically. You can now sync them to your mobile device or listen to them on your computer.


The method for adding songs varies from player to player. iTunes allows you to drag and drop, though you can also specify which folders on your computer you want to add songs from. This may be more useful if you are constantly adding new songs.

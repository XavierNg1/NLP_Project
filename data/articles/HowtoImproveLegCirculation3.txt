 Salt causes your body to retain water and swell, which can put pressure on the veins and lead to poor circulation. Try halving your salt intake and avoiding sprinkling extra salt on your food after it has been prepared.


Do most of your own cooking, rather than eating out. You never know how much salt restaurants are putting in their food, and it's usually more than you think.
Avoid salty snack foods, fast food, and microwaveable dinners and snacks.
Drink plenty of water to flush the salt from your body. You need 2 or so liters a day to stay fully hydrated.
 An important part of keeping your legs and feet healthy and improving circulation is maintaining a healthy body weight. Having extra weight places stress on your circulatory system. Follow a balanced diet and work with your doctor to reach a weight that is right for your body type.


Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats.
Make sure you're getting a good amount of fiber through legumes, nuts, oatmeal, and other fiber-rich foods.

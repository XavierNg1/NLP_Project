 If you try, you can think back to a time when you had an in-person conversation with someone who made you uncomfortable. It might have been something as simple as a gaze that was too intense, or perhaps they were standing too close to you. More than likely, you wanted to get out of that conversation as quickly as possible, and had no desire to engage in conversation with them again. What was missing in their communication and body language was a sense of being calm, relaxed and natural.;
, Remember, eye contact is a natural occurrence between two people who are engaged in conversation. Making eye contact does not mean staring at the other person. It is natural to make eye contact sporadically, as opposed to looking into your prospect’s eyes throughout the entire encounter.
 Unless it’s a serious or dramatic part of your conversation, you should smile while making eye contact. A natural smile will help you to keep your eye contact authentic and appropriate.

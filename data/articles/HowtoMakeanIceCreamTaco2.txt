 Turn a waffle iron on and adjust the temperature according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Use medium-high heat for a perfectly browned taco shell., Measure out ingredients for waffle batter according to the directions on a packaged pancake and waffle mix. You can also whip up your own waffle batter from scratch.
 Pour about 1⁄2 cup (120 mL) of batter into your waffle iron, depending on how large of a style you have. Cook and lightly brown the waffle about 3 minutes, or until only a small amount of steam comes from the hot iron and batter., It’s important to start forming the taco shape of the shell while the freshly made waffles are still warm. After you’re done lightly browning the waffle, fold it in half while it’s still warm and hold the shape in place between the sides of an upside down muffin tin.Repeat this step as needed for however many ice cream tacos you’re making.
 After you fill up the bottom of muffin tins with however many shells you need to make ice cream tacos, place them in a 350 °F (177 °C) oven for about five minutes. Check them after three minutes, and take them out when the waffles are golden brown and crisp., So you don't have to deal with melted ice cream, let your waffle shells cool down for about 10 minutes.


Speed the cooling process up by placing shells in the freezer.
 After your shells are formed and cool, scoop the tastiest ice cream you can think of into them. Each waffle shell will hold two to three scoops, so use a variety if you want. Lightly press the sides of your shell into the scooped ice cream.
 What makes ice cream tacos so great is how fun it is to eat them. Make them even more fun by topping them off with drizzled caramel, chocolate chips, crushed cookies or gummy worms. Make faux sour cream by adding Cool Whip to the top.

 Then go back to kissing their lips. This is romantic and passionate and if you pause slowly in between each kiss you’ll only add to the anticipation. This can help you to break up the monotony of kiss after kiss and it also leaves you free to explore and kiss other areas around that area. , Breathing into your partner’s ear can help make the earlobe kiss even more passionate. Don’t blow - a little breath will do the trick. You can even say their name softly for added emphasis, but make sure you say it quietly because everything is very amplified when you’re talking that close to their ear. You can kiss their cheek softly on the way back to their mouth if you want to. , Kissing the neck is a classic move, but there’s a reason for it. People really seem to enjoy this, and it’s a nice break from kissing the lips because it’s so close. Try biting or sucking on the skin around the neck lightly for extra emphasis – you don’t want to leave your partner with an embarrassing mark. You don’t need to use your tongue at all in this scenario though, that will probably end up looking messy and wet. , There really isn’t a bad place to kiss someone as long as they feel comfortable. It will just look like you are exploring their body and show your partner that you like all of them – even enough to kiss it. Kissing your wife’s stomach when she is expecting is a great example of this technique.

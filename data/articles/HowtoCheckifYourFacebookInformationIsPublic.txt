 Click on "Account" in the upper right hand side of your dashboard.;
, Under "Basic Directory Information", click on "View Settings".


If the first listing called "Search for me on Facebook" is set to "Everyone", then your name and profile are publicly available and can be scooped up by anyone seeking to gather this public information. This means that your name and profile URL are probably in the aforementioned torrent.
 That will determine if someone searching your name will see your Facebook profile in the search results. (This is one of the many steps you can take to ungoogle yourself.)


Go back to your main privacy settings page. At the left hand lower corner of the screen click on the "Edit Settings" button (under "Applications and Websites").
Click on "Edit Settings" under "Public Search".
If the "Enable public search" check box is ticked, it means that search engines are indexing your profile. Uncheck the box to stop this from happening. To return, click on "Back to Applications".

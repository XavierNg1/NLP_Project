 One of the downsides of buying appliances on Craigslist is that you won't be able to specify the exact make and model you want. By planning your purchases ahead of time, you'll have plenty of time to browse Craigslist listings each day. This will allow you to wait until an appliance is listed that more closely meets your needs.


Craigslist even allows you to subscribe to an RSS feed for your search results. For example, you can search for a stove under $300, subscribe to the RSS feed by clicking the RSS button, and then read all new qualified posts in your RSS reader application.;
, When you finally see a listing that you like, the seller will be more willing to sell to you if you can pick the appliance up soon. Find a friend that will help you with the move beforehand, and try to make arrangements for borrowing a truck if necessary.
 An appliance (even a used one) is a big commitment. If the seller isn't even willing to take a photograph and upload it, you can reasonably expect that the sale might not go smoothly or that something is wrong with the appliance.
 When replying to a listing, ask to check the appliance out first before making arrangements to pick it up. This will allow you to evaluate characteristics that won't show up in photographs, like odors or loud operating noises.
 As you inspect the appliance (or in your reply to the listing), ask why they are selling it. You may get a fairly guarded reply, but they may admit that the appliance doesn't work as well as it used to. This will position you to ask questions about the appliance's performance and condition.
 When you have inspected the appliance and are happy with it, arrange to pick it up. Unless the seller has specified that they will help you move it, assume that responsibility falls on you. Communicate with them to let them know when you'll be there to pick it up, and arrive when you say you will.

 First, if your shirt has buttons, button them all up. Then lay your shirt on its front, with its back facing up, preferably on a flat, sturdy surface like a table (as opposed to a soft surface, like a bed). Straighten each sleeve so they extend straight out from either side., Fold the sleeve over from its shoulder, creating a roughly 45-degree downward angle along your crease. As you do, line the sleeve up with the shirt’s side, so they run parallel, with the sleeve’s cuff meeting the shirt’s bottom. Smooth the first sleeve out with your hand from shoulder to cuff, and then repeat with the second., After its first fold, a couple inches of each sleeve will be hanging off the side of your shirt. With each one, take the outer half (the one that’s spilling over the shirt’s side) and fold it over the inner half. Use your hands to smooth out both sleeves again from top to bottom., Use both hands to pinch each shoulder and sleeve together. Then lift the top of your shirt and draw it back until the bottom of your collar reaches the bottom of your shirt, with the chest now facing up. Smooth your shirt out to form a light crease where it’s folded in half below the chest.

 Your goal in a relationship is to build connections and work through problems together. Being angry may give you a sense of self righteousness, but it does nothing to move a relationship forward to a solution. Let your anger go, even if you are "right".
 In the course of all relationships there will be disagreements. This is normal. But how you handle these disagreements reflects on the health of your relationship. Disagreements are not the time to air every grievance you have ever had. Disagreements are also not the time to "get even" with your partner by hurting them emotionally. Disagreements are a time to discuss your different views as they relate to the problem at hand and work towards a mutual solution.
 In the early stages of a relationship expressing your love is natural and regular. You can not wait to hold their hand, steal a kiss or more. But after a few years or decades, even the steamiest relationships tends to cool. Hand holding, back rubs, and kisses do not just happen, especially if you have kids. Make time for these things. Make a conscious daily effort to establish loving physical contact with your partner.
 Daily express your appreciation for your partner . Even if your partner is just doing their "fair share", it is still important to thank them. When your husband does the dishes say, "Thanks for doing the dishes". When your wife puts the kids to bed say, "Thanks for handling the kids tonight." It seems silly but these little niceties go a long way for making your partner feel appreciated, and feeling appreciated can head off resentment or anger stemming from "not feeling appreciated".
 Do not demand from your partner. Ask nicely, even if it is something you expect them to do. Instead of saying "Get the kid juice", say "Would you please get the kid juice?" Saying "please" changes a demand to a favor and helps establish a respectful cooperative relationship.

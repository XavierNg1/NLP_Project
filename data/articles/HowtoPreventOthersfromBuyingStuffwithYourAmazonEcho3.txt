 To order items through your Amazon Echo, you must verbally confirm the purchase by saying your code out loud. Therefore, make sure any unauthorized persons like children and other adults are not nearby.This way, you can prevent unauthorized persons from hearing and using your passcode without your permission.
 Do not use a simple passcode like “1234” or “4444.” These are too easy to guess. Also, do not use personal information like your birthdate, your credit card PIN number, or the last four digits of your Social Security number.Instead, use a unique passcode that is difficult to guess and one that does not contain any identifying information.
 To prevent unauthorized persons from learning and using your passcode to purchase items, change it once or twice a month. If you use your Amazon Echo to purchase items on a regular basis, then you may need to change your passcode more often like once every seven to ten days.Make sure to change your passcode if you say it around any unauthorized persons.

 Even if you were fired, you probably picked up new skills and experiences at your old job. Updating your resume with those things can help you feel like the last job was a positive step in your career. Seeing it this way can help you move past the negative feelings associated with being fired.
 You’ve probably built up a good network of people – either personally or on social media sites like LinkedIn. Ask for recommendations or references. After you’ve spent some time reflecting on what you want your next opportunity to look like, ask your network for help finding it.For example, you can send a short email that says “Hi Steve, I’m looking for my next career opportunity, and I’m interested in moving more into sales than marketing. I was hoping you could point me in the right direction since you have so much sales experience!”

, You can say something like “Dear Kim, I’m applying for a new position with XYZ Management, and given our work history together, I was hoping you’d be willing to write a reference for me.” Make sure you include where the reference letter should go, who it should be addressed to, and when it’s due., You should definitely take a little bit of time to deal with being fired, but get back on the job market as soon as possible. This not only prevents large gaps in your resume, but it can also help you feel like you’ve got control over your life again., It can be tempting to send your resume everywhere in the panic after you’ve been fired. Time might be of the essence, but spend at least some time researching companies in your field before you apply. This helps you use your time wisely and is especially important if you’ve been fired after a long time with one company.

 If chronic patellar tendinitis is suspected, surgery maybe an option to help clean up debris in the tendon.Depending on the severity of your injury, your doctor will repair tears found in your tendon.


The surgeon may need to reattach the tendon by first drilling holes in the patella. Then a suture is placed through the tendon and tied to the top of the patella. A newer surgical procedure involves reattaching the tendon using an anchor. Most patients are able to go home the same day of surgery.You will need to attend physical therapy as directed after surgery.
 Platelet-rich plasma injections are thought to help otherwise weak tendon tissue to regenerate and repair quicker.,To administer an injection, a specialist will first take a blood sample from you. Then, the sample is put in a centrifuge to separate the platelet-rich plasma from the rest of the blood. The plasma is then injected into the tendon. The entire process takes about 20 minutes.These injections are not covered by insurance as they have not yet been proven to be any better than placebo.
 This alternative therapy option relies on sound waves to relieve tendon pain.Studies show that extra-corporeal shock wave therapy can help with recovery and with pain by stimulating cells to repair the tendon.This therapy is usually used when all other options are exhausted. It is not considered the first or best option because it is used with more chronic pain.<

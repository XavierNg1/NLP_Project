 Lift the lid of the reservoir and fill the reservoir with fresh water until it's about 1/2 to 3/4 full.  Plug the samovar into an electric outlet, turn it on, and set it to medium-high or high heat and wait for the water to come to a boil.
 When the water has come to a full rolling boil, it's time to place loose tea into the small teapot that you set aside in the previous step. Put one teaspoon of loose tea per cup that you plan to make. Add one additional teaspoon "for the pot." So, for example, if you plan to make 4 cups of tea, put 5 teaspoons of loose tea in the teapot (one teaspoon for each cup and one additional teaspoon "for the pot")., Turn the heat down to low on the samovar and return the small teapot to its place on top of the samovar. Let the tea steep for 3-5 minutes.

Be careful not to touch any metal parts of the samovar with your bare hands, as they will likely be hot from the boiling water and steam.
 When the tea has steeped long enough for your liking, pour the freshly brewed tea into a teacup or tea mug.  

Use a good potholder or thick towel when handling the small teapot to protect your hands from the heat and any steam rising from the reservoir. Fill the cup or mug only about 3/4 of the way full with the brewed tea (or less full if the tea looks very dark). Because the teapot is small, the tea is more concentrated.
You might want to strain the tea as you are pouring it into the cup or mug through a small tea strainer to avoid bits of loose tea in your cup.
,, Refill the reservoir as well to ensure that it doesn't boil dry.  

There you have it, endless cups of fragrant rich tea!

, Finally, when you have drunk your fill of tea, turn off the samovar (you can also unplug it for good measure), discard the used tea leaves and rinse out the small teapot so it's ready for your next tea party.

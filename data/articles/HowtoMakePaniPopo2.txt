 Coat a 9-inch by 13-inch (23-cm by 33-cm) baking dish with cooking spray.


A round 12-inch (30-cm) baking dish would also work.
 Cover your hands with nonstick cooking spray. Take each thawed ball of dough in your hands and roll it gently, coating all sides of the surface with the cooking spray.


You can use shortening or cooking oil instead of cooking spray, if desired.
Each dough ball must have a light coating of oil.
 Evenly arrange the balls of dough in your prepared baking dish. Set the dish aside and let the dough rise until doubled in size.


Cover the dough with a clean dish towel to protect it from dust and debris.
For best results, place the dough in a warm, draft-free spot as it rises.
 Depending on how long it takes your oven to preheat, you may want to do this shortly before the rolls have finished rising.
 Add the coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk, and white sugar to a small mixing bowl. Whisk the ingredients together into a smooth, even sauce.


This sauce will be quite sweet. If you would prefer a milder sauce, decrease the amount of sugar down to 2 or 3 Tbsp (30 or 45 ml).
 Once the rolls have finished rising, evenly pour the coconut sauce over the tops and sides of the dough.


The sauce should cling to the surface of each roll, but most of it will sink down to the bottom of the pan.
 Place the rolls in your preheated oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until they turn golden brown in color.
 Remove the finished pani popo from the oven. Let the rolls cool for a few minutes, then enjoy them while they are still warm and fresh.


Scoop the individual rolls directly out of the pan and onto serving plates. Spoon any extra sauce from the bottom of the pan over the top of each roll before enjoying.
Alternatively, invert the pan onto a large serving platter and serve the rolls upside-down (sauce-side up).

 How about drawing a character from your favorite website? One great place to start is trying to draw a WeeMee from WeeWorld.com


When you draw the face first, don't add a nose, just do a simple black outline.
Then, draw the features. Don't use colored pencils, just your main writing utensil.
Then, add the clothes, and hairstyle. Remember to use your imagination!
Erase any unwanted lines. Now color with artist utensils, such as paintbrushes, colored pencils, crayons, etc.;
, Okay, so it wasn't really your idea.
, But this time, change around the features. Make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. Try clothes that you would wear, or ones you wish you could get. Change the size around and make the features different ... add a nose, things like that. Now, color your creation.
 Notice the difference? One is an imitation -- and the other is all you! Now, grab a new piece of notebook paper.
 Maybe you want to draw a cute Labrador Retriever. Or, maybe you want to draw a cute little baby! Your cartoon could even be about a talking apple or something.
 Draw the character you imagine. Try using a Sharpie marker for the outline, carefully tracing the pencil first. Erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, use writing utensils such as crayons, markers, colored pencils, or even pastels. Paint works good, too.
 Write down an idea of a comic series! Make a plot, funny lines you could use, and other characters.
 Make it into about fourths. Next, draw your main character, just using a pencil first.
,, Outline with Sharpie or black marker. Erase any and all stray marks. Color if wanted.
, Your perfect, awesome, totally YOU cartoon! Congratulations!

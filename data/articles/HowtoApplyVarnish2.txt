 Dip just the tip of your brush into the varnish-thinner mixture, and gently apply it to your piece. Work in the direction of the wood grain, not back-and-forth. Start in one corner and do a one foot square. When that is finished, move your brush and start another square right next to it. Repeat until the entire surface is covered.








Keep dipping your brush into the varnish to keep it wet.
Wear rubber gloves and a respirator, if you want to protect yourself from fumes and spills.
 “Tipping off” smoothes out the surface of the varnish and helps prevent any bubbles and streaks. Hold the brush at a right angle to the work surface, and lightly brush just the tip of the brush over the whole varnished surface. Once again, work in the direction of the wood grain.
 Most projects will need several coats of varnish. Let each coat dry thoroughly. This will take at least 6 hours, and probably 24 or more. After the second coat has dried, sand the piece with 320-grit sandpaper. Wipe away the residue, then apply at least one more coat of varnish.








Varnish is dry when it does not feel tacky to the touch.
If your sandpaper becomes clogged with residue, it’s a sign the varnish has not sufficiently dried.
Light-wear projects, like trim, may only need one coat of varnish. Heavy-duty pieces like furniture may need around five..
Let the final coat cure for several weeks before using the item.

 Keep a tissue or a thick handkerchief with you at all times. A tissue is portable and disposable, but a handkerchief will do a better job of muffling the sound. If you have no other choice, bury your nose into your shoulder, your arm, or the crook of your elbow. Any fabric or solid body part will help keep your sneeze quiet.;
, Leave your mouth slightly open so that you don't build up too much pressure in your sinuses. Done correctly, this move should lessen the intensity of your sneeze.If you hold your breath at the same time, you might even be able to stop the sneeze from coming.
 Make sure to get the timing just right. By mixing up the reflex to sneeze with the reflex to cough, you might lessen the sound and severity of each noise.

 Many people have hair that cannot be fully detangled when it’s dry. But it’s important to try detangling as much as possible before you cover your hair in conditioner. This will make your job easier.
 Divide your hair into four sections as discussed earlier and work your fingers through each section. Going section by section, shampoo your hair. Gently massage your scalp as you go. As you rinse your hair, work your fingers through each section and continue to work out any remaining tangles.
 If you have dry or normal hair, use a leave-in conditioner on the ends of the hair and apply after shampooing. If you have oily hair, put conditioner only on the bottom 2/3 of your hair before using shampoo. Then use the shampoo to wash it off. You also might consider using a specific detangling conditioner, which you can massage into your hair following the shampoo and then rinse off., Be gentle when rubbing your hair with a towel -- the friction and fibers from your towel can make tangles even worse. Use patting and squeezing motions instead of rubbing. If you have really long hair, do it in increments. Pat and squeeze the bottom first, then a little further up and so on until you reach the roots. 







, Do it in the same manner as for dry hair -- start with one section of hair and work on the knots from the ends to the roots. Then use a wide-toothed comb, moving to a smaller-toothed comb if it’s necessary.

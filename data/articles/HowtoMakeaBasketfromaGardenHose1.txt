 Is there an area in the backyard where the gardening tools get thrown in the corner or do you need a handy holder for swim items like goggles, flippers, and/or pool toys? Figure out how you will integrate the basket into your outdoor décor, as this will likely effect the color and style of the basket you create.;
, While you could just create the basket from an old garden hose you have laying around, it's probably best to spring for a new hose in a color that matches your outdoor décor. If you hit the lawn and garden store such as Bunnings or Masters ect, you will most likely have several colors to accommodate your needs––they may even have some fancy patterns!


Consider matching the zip tie color to the hose color or purchase zip ties in a complementary, contrasting color.

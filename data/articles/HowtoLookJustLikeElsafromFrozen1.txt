 Good places to look are Macy's, Lulus, Amazon, Pacsun, and Aeropostale. Blue and purple are the preferred colors.;
, A maxi skirt that fades is probably your best option. You can get maxi skirts from the places listed above.
 This goes with a lot of outfits. Maybe add some gloves to dress up the look a bit.
 This can easily clash with your outfit. You have to remember that Elsa is animated and most likely has a different complexion and face "genetics" than you do. Add a pretty, rosy blush to the apples of your cheeks.
 Twist your hair up above your left eyebrow to the back of your hair and secure it with an elastic. Leave half of your bangs on your forehead, just like Elsa does.

, Make sure the tires that you have on the rims are good for the road. No cracks on the sidewall, and to have at least 4/32nd (50%) of tread depth.
 Before mounting the wheel onto the machine, make sure you have your center caps off (if you have them), and the old wheel weights from the previous balancing off. This is to ensure that you get the most accurate results from the machine.
 After you have done all the previous steps, you can now safely mount your wheel onto the machine. Once it is on, double check to make sure that the wheel is snug tight.
 Once the wheel is on, the machine will want to know the size of the rim. You will have to measure the height of the rim, as well as the width

 If you don’t do this before closing down the hood, it will ask you if you have done it or not to be a reminder.
 Once you have measure your rims and have chosen the proper type of vehicle, you can simply presses start or close the hood.
 Once the machine has finished testing the road force and balance the wheel, it will tell you how much weight it wants and what side of the wheel.
 Once you have install the wheel weights, you want to rebalance the wheel to make sure you added the proper amount of the wheel weights, and at the proper spot of the rim it has asked.
 After rebalancing your wheel and it says “ok”, you are now done and can take the wheel off the machine. The wheel is now ready to be install on the vehicle.

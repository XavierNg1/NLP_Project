Select black and orange burlap or tulle.
Use 1 yard/90cm of each fabric for one standard wreath form.
 Cut strips of about 10cm/4 inches and 1.5cm/1/2 inch wide.
 Then tie a bunch of orange strips. Ensure that there is sufficient of each to allow the color to stand out.
 Be generous with the amount of strips added; the fluffier this is, the better it will look.
 What you add is really up to you but some suggestions include:


Wooden cut-outs with Halloween designs, tied on with ribbon or glued on
Ribbon bows in orange and black
Paper cut-outs with Halloween designs, glued in place
Black and orange artificial flowers.
, Hang on your front door.

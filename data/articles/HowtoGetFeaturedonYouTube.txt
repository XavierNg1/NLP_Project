 If you post something adult, only the adult audience will see it. If it's more risque, it might get removed all together. Post something that's entertaining AND PG-13.;
, Experiment and try to choose the style that will guarantee more views. There are many popular genres you can try such as:


Art
Music
Vlogging
Or even just nature around you!

, People will not want to see a popular song or a popular movie trailer (these are on abundance online). Do something unique. Think about how you would feel if you were the audience. Would you want to watch the video because of the content? Even try a parody or a song or movie!

, These grow tiresome, and they can stir up controversy.
 Make your page attention-grabbing, and have a colorful background that will catch peoples' eyes.

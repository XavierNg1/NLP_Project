 There’s no legal requirement for either you or your spouse to change your name after marriage. If either or both of you do, you’re only allowed to change your last name, not your first name.
 Whatever you decide to do, you should use the same name on all documents and accounts. If you change your mind at a later point, you’ll have to file a petition in court to have your name changed to something else.
 The SSA needs official, certified documentation of your name change, not a photocopy.


You also must take your birth certificate or passport to prove your citizenship and identity when you fill out the name change application.
You don’t have to pay a fee to get your name changed on your Social Security card. A new card will be mailed to you when your application is processed., You’ll need your marriage decree as proof of your marriage to change your name on your license.


The DPS also wants to see your Social Security card with your new name on it, and two documents that prove your current address.You’ll be charged $28 for your new license., After you have your new name on your photo ID and Social Security card, you can easily change your name on credit cards, bank accounts and elsewhere.

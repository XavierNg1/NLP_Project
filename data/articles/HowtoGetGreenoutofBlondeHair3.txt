 There are several types of commercial hair care products intended for swimmers that can help remove the green from hair when natural home remedies just won't cut it.


Try Malibu C Swimmers shampoo and conditioner Sally Beauty's Ion Swimmer's shampoo.The main ingredients to look for in the shampoo you choose are aloe, Vitamin E, and EDTA (Edetic Acid).These will help condition and strengthen your hair and fight the discoloration.
 Follow the instructions on the bottle.Alternatively, you can use a leave-in pre-swim treatment for preventative measures. Try Malibu C Swimmer's Natural Wellness Treatment or H2O Pre Swim Gel. These treatments restore color, seal the hair, and help prevent future discoloration.
 Rinse the special shampoo out of your hair completely.
 Don't blow dry your hair; just let it dry naturally.


Alternatively, you can get a salon treatment called a seal coat (or a gloss coat) that prevents the copper in the water from attaching to the cuticles in your hair. This works best on shorter hair.

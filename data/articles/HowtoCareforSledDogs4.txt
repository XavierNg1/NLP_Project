 A good sled dog will demonstrate a combination of endurance, speed, pulling ability, and perseverance. Sled dogs should also have a certain level of intelligence -- an ability to listen for and obey commands, actively avoid obstacles, and take care of themselves. A thick coat is a must for dogs running long-distance sleds in cold weather. Finally, your dog should be healthy and fit to endure the intense training and distances required of sled dogs.


Your sled dogs don’t need to be of just one breed, but they all need to be able to work together without conflict. Dogs that cause conflicts with others should be removed from the team.
If your dog is puling a sled over a shorter distance and time (two hours or less), it does not need to have such a thick coat.
 This “breed” is actually a mutt -- a cross between Siberian huskies and another breed, which varies. Some Alaskan huskies have wolf ancestry, others have greyhound, German shorthair pointer, hound, or terrier blood.


Wolf-dog mixes can be unpredictable and difficult to train. Use caution if purchasing or employing a husky with a close wolf ancestor.
 One popular variety of Malamute, the freight dog, has high endurance and excels at long trips, though it is not very fast. They usually weigh 80-120 pounds.


Popular depictions of dog sled races usually feature Malamutes or huskies.
 Over a short period of time, though, huskies can pull more than Malamutes. Purebred Siberian huskies are mostly bred for appearance, not pulling ability, and usually make poor sled dogs.
 Like other sled dogs, the Canadian Eskimo dog is muscular and built for pulling. It can cover 15 to 70 miles per day, and is capable of pulling up to 80 kilograms.Don’t confuse the Canadian Eskimo dog with the American Eskimo dog, which has a a short, white, and dense coat.

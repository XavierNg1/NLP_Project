 This can be done by searching for a location by entering one under searching and clicking on one to add to the map, entering an address to add to the map (this can be a home address, or address of a business place), adding a marker by lat/ing, or clicking on the desired location.


If you want to add another marker, or meant to search for something else, just click on "try a different search" (when adding a marker by search).
 You can perform this by lat/ing, by address (for a house or business), or click on the map. Enter the title of your path and click on save.
 Import data from Excel, including a header row, and then click on "Process Data." You can also export your map to reach the column with "Identifying Number," which allows you to change existing data. You can also 'bulk delete' any data by exporting your data and adding "TRUE" to the rows you wish to delete. Import it again, and those markers will get deleted.
 You can email your map by clicking on "Email Map," link to the map by clicking "Link to This Map," get a code snippet by clicking on "Code Snippets" or exporting it to Google Earth by clicking on "Google Earth."

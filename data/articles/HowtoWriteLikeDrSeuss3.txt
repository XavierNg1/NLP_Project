 Part of what makes Dr. Seuss so fun is his ability to create weird and unrealistic situations out of everyday life. The Cat and the Hat begins with two normal children playing inside on a rainy day, and escalates into a life-sized, bow-tie wearing cat pulling two mythical creatures out of a box. Kids love to see relatable, real life situations devolve into complete chaos and fantasy.


Try starting your story in a normal location – a house, school, bank, park – and letting your imagination run wild from there. , When most people think of Dr. Seuss, they can remember some of his most vivid characters by name: the Grinch, the Lorax, Thing One and Thing Two. These characters are so memorable because of their imaginative and wacky appearances and personalities, and also their funny names.


Create characters that are brimming with life, fantasy, silliness, and completely unique traits. Write a list of a few potential character names and some of their physical as a writing exercise. For example, the Flaren might have green wings and wear a rainbow baseball cap.
 Myth and folklore are great resources for learning more about fantasy, compelling characters, and timeless storytelling. Brushing up on some of these classics can help spark your own imagination.


If you are able to draw inspiration from pop culture, kids will instantly find your story relatable.
Travel is another great way to broaden your horizons and expose yourself to new situations and people that you can use later in your writing.

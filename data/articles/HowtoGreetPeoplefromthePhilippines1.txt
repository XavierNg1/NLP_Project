To say good evening, say "Magandang gabi" (ma-gan-dang ga-bi), which means beautiful evening.
 Filipinos are generally accustomed to English, so you can simply say "Hi," "Hello," 'Good Morning,' etc. The person you are greeting will probably understand your basic greeting in English.If you get stuck and don't know what to say, just speak in English.

Also, use opo to say "yes." This is basically the equivalent of saying "yes, ma'am" or "yes sir."

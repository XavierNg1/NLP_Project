 Items that you've set to be deleted are often sent to the Trash. The Trash will hold your items until you set them to be permanently deleted. You can open the Trash Can from the desktop.;
, You can scroll through the Trash Can to find the file or files that you accidentally deleted. If the item is no longer in the Trash, you may need to use one of the following methods.
 If this option is not available, the original location is no longer present. You will need to drag the file out of the Trash and place it on your desktop instead. You can then move the file to wherever you want.

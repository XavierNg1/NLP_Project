 Just play for one or two hours a day. This may be difficult, as a new console is addictive, but just try hard. If you play for hours on end every day, you'll soon get bored with it.;
, Have a ten-fifteen minute break for every hour of play. This is better for your eyes, and restricts the amount of time you play your Wii, thus making you get bored at a later date.
 When you get bored of Tennis, move on to Baseball. When you're bored with that, move on to Bowling, etc. Once in a while, do the Wii Fitness test, or even every day, as you're meant to. Then try the training exercises once in a while too.
 Play the same thing as yourself, then as a friend, as your dad, etc.
 If there is four of you playing a certain game (like bowling), it will make the game last longer, and you'll be having fun with your friends at the same time.

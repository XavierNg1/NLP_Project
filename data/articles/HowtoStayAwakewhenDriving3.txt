 If you're getting tired while driving, pull over and take a nap. A short fifteen to twenty minute nap can recharge your brain, giving you the stamina you need to keep driving. Find a safe place to pull over and nap for about fifteen to twenty minutes.Choose a place far enough away from the main road you will not get hit by oncoming traffic. You should also choose a place that is not too isolated, such as car park near a filling station, for your safety.
Set an alarm. You do not want a twenty minute nap to turn into an hour long nap.
 If you're feeling drowsy, take advantage of your car's stereo system. Turn the music up to at least 90 decibels. This should be disruptive enough that your body will be jarred awake.See if your car's radio measures decibels. If it does not, just try to estimate. Turn up the car's radio until the noise is loud enough that you feel awake.
Only turn the radio or stereo up this high for brief periods when you're tired, however. Habitually listening to music this loud can damage your hearing.
 If at all possible, bring someone else along if you're driving on a long journey for several hours. Having another person in the car can keep you alert as the two of you can take turns driving. If you feel very tired, have the other person drive for a while., The cool sensation of cold wind hitting your face can wake you up. If you start to feel tired, open a window for a few minutes. In addition to providing a cooling sensation, it will create a great deal of background noise. This will prevent you from nodding off., Try listening to something you have to focus on. Listening to music for an entire trip can cause you to zone out. Instead, try listening to things like books on tapes, podcasts, and radio shows. You will end up focusing on the words, which will engage your attention and help prevent you from nodding off.

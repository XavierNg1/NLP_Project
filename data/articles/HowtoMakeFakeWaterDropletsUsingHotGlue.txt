 Squeeze on a small, neat droplet of hot glue on the craft item, right on the spot where you wish it to be. In the case of this article, an artificial flower is used, and the water droplet is added to a petal.


You can add hot glue water droplets on any article able to withstand the addition of hot glue.;
, There will usually be a small thread running from the hot glue gun's nozzle that peaks over the drop; this part is not needed and will spoil the water droplet look if left. Simply cut it off with a small pair of sharp scissors, such as nail scissors.
 More than one dew/water droplet can help to increase the authenticity of the craft object's appeal. You'll need to assess that depending on the object you're enhancing.
 The water droplets look realistic and beautiful. Best of all, they'll last for a long time.

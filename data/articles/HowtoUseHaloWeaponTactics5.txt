 If they are moving, aim up to account for the drop.



Note: The grenade will bounce and could come back and end up hurting or killing you.
Becoming extremely accurate with this gun while using this basic fire mode will make you deadly as the Grenade Launcher is available on a large percentage of the maps, and is a starting weapon for Stage 3 Invasion.
 This allows you to be in a hiding place and shoot your Grenade Launcher. When someone comes close to your grenade, just release the firing button and you either have a kill or have injured your opponent. The Grenade Launcher also releases an EMP with this method, disabling vehicles temporarily to allow to to run away or board/destroy.

 For a more sophisticated take on the usual fries, toss your warm French fries with a tablespoon or two (15 to 30 ml) of garlic-infused olive oil and 1 to 2 tablespoons (7.5 to 15 g) of grated parmesan cheese, depending on how many fries you have. Mix well until the fries are well coated, and eat.Give your French fries even more flavor by mixing fresh chopped herbs, such as parsley, rosemary, or thyme in with the oil and cheese.
 If plain, salted fries seem a little boring, kick the flavor up a notch by sprinkling a spice blend over them. French fries are especially delicious tossed in Old Bay or Cajun seasoning before you eat them, but you can use whatever blend of spices you prefer.Other spice blends that you may want to consider for your fries include steak seasoning and barbecue seasoning.
 In England, French fries are known as chips and are traditionally served with fried fish. To really give the chips flavor, though, vinegar is usually poured over them. Get the same tangy flavor at home by drizzling 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of malt vinegar over the fries and tossing them in it before eating them.Malt vinegar has a very strong flavor, so start with a small amount on your fries and only add more once youâ€™ve tasted them.

 A lot of air-drying clay comes in white. To change white clay to any preferred color, mix small amounts of water-based paints, oil paints, acrylic paint (artist's quality), pastel chalks or poster paints with the clay before modeling. Food-grade colorants can be used too; for example, you can try cake coloring in paste or gel forms (not liquid), while colored drink mix is another option.


Always test a small piece of white clay first, to determine how the color will work and to get the hue you're after.;
, Soften the clay first by working with it, then add the colorant gradually while kneading. This will ensure that the color is distributed evenly throughout the whole piece of clay you'll be using, and by adding the colorant slowly, you can determine when enough color has been added.


Work on a surface that can either be disposed of or can be washed easily, such as a layer of wax paper over the counter-top or a plastic cutting board.

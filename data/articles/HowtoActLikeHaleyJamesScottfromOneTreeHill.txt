 Haley is very smart and used to tutor at her high school. Learn three new words everyday and read books.;
, Haley is friendly and tries to get along with people. Talk to different people and be nice to the people you meet.
 Haley got married, had a kid, and had a singing career all before she graduated high school! When things get hard, don't give up. Instead, fight back.
 Haley's talent is singing. You don't have to sing, but find something you are good at and practice. Hopefully, you will get a career out of it.
 If you keep your friends close if you have relationship problems they will always be there to talk and comfort you.
 Take care of your skin. Eat right and exercise. Don't wear a lot of makeup. Just some concealer, mascara, bronzer, and lipgloss can make you get the same glow that Haley has.

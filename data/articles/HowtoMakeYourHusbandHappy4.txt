 If you're at home when your man gets home, greet him with a smooch and a smile. Doing so immediately sets a positive tone for your subsequent interaction and reinforces the home as a comfortable, happy place., Share in the responsibility of creating dinners that you two can enjoy together. Dinner is a time to share about your day and actually engage with your husband deeply. Avoid opting for the frozen, pre-packaged dinner and make a meal that you can enjoy together.
 Take a weekend to work on a home project together. Building or painting something collectively to improve your home can be a rewarding experience. When you produce something together for each other, the results are extremely gratifying.
 When you've made your house into a comfortable place that represents your relationship, invite your hubby's family over for brunch or dinner. Your husband will appreciate your effort in reaching out to his family and trying to make them feel comfortable, welcome, and loved.
 It's easy to get so comfortable with each other that you almost feel like roommates in your own home. Make sure you continue to be affectionate in your home by cuddling, touching, and kissing throughout the day. Don't let all of your inhibitions fly out the door once you are living with each other. It's still extremely rude and inconsiderate to let your bodily functions fly, not to mention it's a huge turn off.

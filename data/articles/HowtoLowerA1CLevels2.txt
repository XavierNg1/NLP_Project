 Physical activity will naturally lower blood sugar levels, improve heart health and energy levels, and also contribute to weight loss. Diabetics who exercise regularly will often have better control of their blood sugar levels and exhibit healthier A1C levels.
 Anaerobic exercises such as weight training may temporarily increase your blood sugar levels, whereas aerobic exercise such as walking or swimming will help automatically lower your blood sugar levels. Over time, both types of exercise will help contribute to lower A1C levels.
 The more active you are, the better your A1C levels will become over time. For example, take stairs instead of the escalator when possible, and walk to the corner store instead of driving.

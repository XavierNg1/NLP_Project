You may need to restart the component you are trying to connect. Many components are only discoverable within the first few minutes after starting up., In the Bluetooth menu, select the component/device that you want to link to your computer.


You may be required to utilize a passkey in order to pair two devices (such as a computer, phone, or tablet). A passkey is a temporary password created by a user. You will be asked to set a passkey when you attempt to link one device with another, and then you must enter the identical passkey on the second device to complete the pairing.

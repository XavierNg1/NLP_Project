 For a more formal look, you can make a bracelet that’s perfect for a cocktail dress and a night on the town. A stylish, elegant look can be created with a simple string of circular beads. This will give you the string of pearls look without the string of pearls price.
 Depending on your style and preference, look for either metal, pearl, or imitation pearl beads. They should be roughly pea-sized.


These should be simple. Try not to use more than three colors and be sure that the colors you use are similar. You may wish to get the beads in a few slightly different sizes. Use them in a random or semi-random pattern to give your bracelet a little variation.
You may also want to get very small beads to put in between the larger ones. These act as spacers and can create a slightly different look, as well as making your bracelet more flexible.
 Next get fishing line or strong thread. Elastic strings can also be used if you do not want your bracelet to have a clasp. This will be used to string the beads together. It may be possible to use ribbon and do a bow closure, but this will depend on the size of your beads and their center holes.


Measure your wrist and add length depending upon how loose you would like your bracelet to fit. You can also gauge length by measuring other bracelets you have. Be sure to leave an extra at the ends, to attach the clasp if you wish to have one or to tie the elastic strings if you do not. Any unnecessary thread will be cut later.
 Arrange them how you feel it looks best. Attach the clasp you have chose to use, using the method recommended on its packaging. Trim extra threads and you’re done!

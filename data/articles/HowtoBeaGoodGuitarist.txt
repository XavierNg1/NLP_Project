 A good guitarist must be an expert in the fundamentals of guitar playing. The fundamentals include posture when holding the guitar, proper left and right hand finger positioning, and plectrum or pick usage.;
, Though reading guitar tablature is easier, it generally has one drawback: it does not show timing. The beginner should at least be familiar with reading musical notation. Granted, some very talented guitarists are able to play without ever needing tablature or sheet music; they learn a song just by listening to it. But unless you are one of these people, you'll be better-off mastering musical notation so you'll have access to a wide collection of compositions.
 Do drills and exercises to polish your skills and technique. Strengthen your fingers, and aim for a clean and clear tone. Avoid muted sounds unless the music calls for it.
 Learn easy songs first. Not only does this build confidence, but it also helps your fingers 'remember' certain formations and chords that tend to be repeated in other songs.
 Do not get into the habit of not finishing what you start. If a certain part of a song frustrates you, put the guitar down and take a break. You may even sleep on it, and start fresh the next day. Do it at your own pace, it doesn't matter how long you take to master a piece. Of course, remember the previous step. Be reasonable. Do not take on a complicated song or piece if you haven't mastered your basics.
 Do not expect to play like a famous guitar 'god' with just a few lessons. Attaining a professional skill level takes years of practice and training.
 Compare one artist's interpretation of a song to another's. Have an open mind. A good guitarist is familiar with different styles and genres.
 Listen to yourself and identify your mistakes and weaknesses. Have another guitarist critique it. You'll improve more if you know what you must work harder on.

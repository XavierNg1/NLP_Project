 To ensure that the oven will be hot enough to bake the cookie bowls, you must preheat it to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Next, grease a jumbo muffin tin with nonstick cooking spray so the bowls won’t stick after baking.You can use butter to grease the muffin tin if you prefer.
If you prefer, you can use a silicone muffin pan, which is a nonstick so it doesn’t require greasing.
 To make the batter, add 1 14.3 ounce (405 g) package of your favorite cookies, 1 egg, and 2 tablespoons (28 g) of melted butter to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse the mixture until it is well combined.You can use any type of cookies that you like for the bowls. Chocolate sandwich cookies, graham crackers, oatmeal cookies, vanilla wafers, ginger snaps, and peanut butter cookies are all delicious options.
It usually helps to roughly break the cookies into pieces as you add them to the food processor.
 After you’ve mixed up the batter, add approximately 2 tablespoons (42 g) of batter to each cup in the muffin tin. Use clean fingers to gently press the batter into the cup to form a bowl shape.The batter should be packed as firmly into the muffin tin cups as possible. You may want to use a shot glass or other small glass to press the batter into place to ensure that they’re well packed.
 Once the batter is pressed into the muffin tin cups, place the tin in the preheated oven. Allow the cookie bowls to bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are completely set.You may have difficult time telling if bowls made from dark-colored cookies are finished baking from the appearance alone. Make sure to feel them to see if they are firm.
 Remove the muffin tin from the oven once they are finished baking. Let them cool for at least 15 minutes in the tin before gently prying them out with a small offset spatula to fill them.

Iron is the agent that gives the amethyst its purple hue. The shade can vary from a pale reddish-violet to medium violet to deep blackish-purple. The most valuable amethysts are those that are deep purple with rose, blue, or red flashes.;
,


Amethysts do not display their truest or best colors in artificial indoor lighting. Ask to see the stone outside in the daylight or under a jewelers light.



A good quality amethyst is transparent. If you hold it up to the light, the light should travel completely through the stone. Amethysts of high quality should be completely clear and should not contain inclusions. Also, check the surface of the ring to make sure there are no nicks or scratches.
The prongs or edges of the stone's setting within the ring should be secure, with no loose or sharp edges, and no chips in the stone itself.
 Many jewelers have websites where you can read testimonials from other customers.


If you plan to buy more gemstones, you might also consider joining a gemstone club to become more well-versed on how to select high quality stones and where to get them.



If you want a darker stone, you are going to pay more. The highest priced amethysts are Deep Russians, which are rare and carry an average cost of about $50,000 per carat.



It is always possible that, once you get your amethyst home, you will discover a flaw in the stone you did not see before you left the store. Make certain you can return or exchange your item should this occur.

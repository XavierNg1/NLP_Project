 Your face is the first thing hotel guests will see upon arriving, which makes you the ambassador for the hotel. So it is very important that you are smiling while working the front desk, especially when you greet guests. A genuine smile will help guests feel happy and welcomed about checking-in.To personalize the experience for your guests, refer to them by a title and their last name, for example, Mr. Smith.
 While you are checking guests in, ask them questions about their stay so you can anticipate any future needs. Additionally, use cues like body language to ensure that your guests have a comfortable stay while at the hotel.For example, ask your guests if their stay is for leisure or work. If it is for leisure, ask them if they would like any recommendations for dinner or things to do around the local area. If it is a work trip, then let them know where your conference rooms and computers are. Also, see if they need a wake-up call in the morning.
If one of your guests has a baby, for example, make sure to offer additional services, like a crib or bottle warmers, to help them feel at home.
 Do this while you are checking them in. By conversing with your guests, you can help them feel welcome. Making meaningful conversation with your guests signals that you (and the hotel) genuinely care about them and their stay at the hotel.For example, ask them how their flight or drive went. If it did not go so well, then offer them a complimentary breakfast, lunch or dinner.
 Make sure to do this when your guests are checking out. Ask them if their stay went well, especially if there were some issues with their stay. See if the hotelâ€™s solution met their expectations or not.If not, ask the guests what the hotel can do or work on to ensure a better experience, or direct them to fill out a survey.

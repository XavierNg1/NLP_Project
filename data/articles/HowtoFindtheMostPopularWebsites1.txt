 Although each analytic website compiles data differently using their own methods and algorithms, you can use these types of websites to determine the most popular websites.


Visit the Top Sites section of Alexa.com (provided to you in the Sources section of this article) to review a list of the most popular websites as compiled by Alexa. Alexa uses monthly data to determine the most popular websites based on each website's total amount of visitors and page views.
Go to any Internet search engine and enter a keyword phrase such as "most popular websites" to find other analytic websites that can provide you with this information based on statistics, visitors, page views, and more.;
, Most analytic websites will allow you to refine your search to locate popular websites for a particular country or category. For example, if you enjoy shopping, you can refine your search to only include shopping websites.


Click on either the "By Country" or "By Category" tabs from Alexa's Top Sites page to refine your search for popular websites based on your preferences.

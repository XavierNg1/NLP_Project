 Keep your planted leg straight, along with your upper body.


The purpose of scales is to learn how to stably balance your body. In order to be a skilled gymnast, you need complete control of your muscles at all times. Scales allows you to practice this skill in a safe environment.
 Hold your arms apart for balance. Keep your toes pointed forward and both legs and torso straight. Once your leg is in position, hold it in place for a few seconds.
 You will want to strengthen and learn how to balance both sides of your body equally.


Bring your foot up higher and repeat your scales after doing them with both legs. With training, you will eventually be able to keep your balance with your leg facing forward at a right angle to your body.
 Swing one leg backwards, keeping both your legs straight. Tilt your body forward to maintain a straight line between your body and airborne leg.


With practice, you will be able to do a back leg scale so far that your body and leg become parallel with the ground.

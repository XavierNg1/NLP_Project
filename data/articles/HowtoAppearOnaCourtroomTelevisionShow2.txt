 While some courtroom shows offer free tickets to anyone, others may charge a fee to be in the audience or even require you to arrange through a casting agency (as is the case when audience members are paid actors). Feel free to call or e-mail the show if you have any questions.
 If you are able to obtain tickets, dress appropriately and arrive early on the day of the taping. The judge and the litigants may get the spotlight, but you will be seen in the background! And, if you arrive at the studio late, you may not be admitted.
 Remain quiet throughout the case and do not talk to your seatmates, turn your cellphone completely off, and pay attention to the proceedings so you will be aware of what is going on.
 This will likely be your only opportunity. And of course, don't forget to ask about when the episode that was taped will be aired on TV.

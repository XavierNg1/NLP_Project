 This never makes anyone feel better. It’s just a way for you to make everything about you.
 Give her time to get all of her feelings out. If you aren’t willing to spend the time with her necessary to make her feel better, don’t get involved to begin with.
 You don’t want her to feel like you’re ignoring or minimizing her problems. If she really doesn't want to talk about it, that’s one thing, but don’t just pretend like nothing is wrong.
 This is not an opportunity for you to get in her pants. If you want her to like you more, just be supportive and a good friend. She’ll remember that later.
 Telling someone to smile really isn’t helpful and is a common creeper line. You can mean it earnestly, but it’s going to remind her of all those old guys on the bus that stare at her boobs.

 Incorrect information on a death certificate is important to change. Not only does it affect demographers' data, it may impact an insurance settlement. You should get organized at an early stage by identifying all details you need to correct on the death certificate. It is possible, and imperative, to amend any and all incorrect details of the death certificate.For example, a death certificate with an inaccurate veteran status may affect death insurance claims you file with armed forces aid associations.
Incorrect dates, misspelled names, and other personal information should always be corrected.;
, Anyone is eligible to initiate the amendment process if they find information they know to be incorrect and get the necessary signatures. However, some states have restrictions on who can actually file the paperwork. If you are not eligible to file death certificate amendment paperwork, contact those who are. Tell them what is wrong and how you can give evidence to back up your claims.


For example, in Michigan, only a certifying physician or medical examiner can amend medical details such as cause of death., You can always amend death certificates as long as you have evidence to support your claims. However, the manner in which you file the amendment paperwork is more restricted as time goes on. This varies state-by-state, however in many cases it means only being able to file through your state's central vital statistics and vital information registry.


For example, in Minnesota, the funeral home can only amend the death certificate in the first year after death. After 5 years, only the state registrar can process and file your request.

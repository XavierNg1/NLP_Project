 You can find one in the phone book or by searching online for “seamstress” plus the name of your town or city.


Be aware that some seamstresses are very busy, and alterations can take some time. If you need the dress very soon, you may have to try another method if the seamstress cannot finish it in time.
 Although he/she may tailor the entire dress to fit better, you should make it explicit that the dress falls down, so you want it tailored to fit your bust better.
 It is important to make sure you try the dress on at the seamstress’ shop before taking it home. This way, you can make sure it fits just right.
 If you try the dress on, and it still feels a bit loose, say this! A seamstress uses a measuring tape to see how the dress should fit, but a misplaced pin could throw measurements off. If you don’t feel right in the dress, then kindly explain that.


Be sure to be courteous. Do your best to be gracious to the person who makes your clothes fit.

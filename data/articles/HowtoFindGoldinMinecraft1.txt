 You cannot mine gold with any other tool.;
, Always dig at an angle, not straight down, to avoid falling. Leave a trail of torches behind you if you're traveling through caves.
 Gold is found only below layer 31. You can check your current layer by pressing F3 on Minecraft for computers, or by checking a map in the console edition. The y-coordinate tells you which layer you are on. Here are the best layers to look for gold:Layer 28 is the highest and usually safest layer where you'll find the maximum amount of gold.
Layers 11â€“13 are the best places to look for gold and diamond at the same time. Try to avoid digging below layer 10, where lava becomes much more common.
 Dig a main horizontal tunnel to get started. Mine branches off this main tunnel one block wide and two blocks tall to search for gold. Gold ore typically spawns in groups of four to eight blocks.This means you'll find almost all of the gold if you keep three solid blocks between each tunnel.


To find every single gold block (but at a slower rate), keep two solid blocks between each tunnel.
 While mining, you might encounter a stronghold, dungeon, or abandoned mine shaft with these features. Each of these can contain chests with gold or more precious items.

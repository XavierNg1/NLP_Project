 Make sure the size is appropriate to the amount of work you plan on showing. If possible, choose a portfolio case that represents your design style. Empty journals, leather binders and photo albums all work well as portfolio cases.;
, It's always helpful for prospective clients, employers, or educational institutes to know a bit about your background and that which motivates you as an interior designer. Write a short introduction that reflects what you do and what your objectives are.


If appropriate for the occasion, include a proposal for the job or project. When bidding on a job or applying for a grant, it's essential to illustrate what your intentions are.



You don't have to include every project you've ever done in your portfolio, but you should be able to demonstrate a range of different assignments or projects you have worked on.
Try to include projects you are proud of to show your best work.



For the projects you have selected, demonstrate their progression from initial concept to final design by showing floor plans, designs, sketches and photos. You can include other support materials that served as inspiration along the way if it's helpful to understanding the final result.
Put each process together in a logical progression so those viewing your portfolio can easily understand the progress.
If necessary, you can add a written description of each project. This can help clarify any design decisions you might have made.
 Your interior design resume should list all of your relevant work experience, education, volunteer work, competitions, publication, and awards.
 Include business cards with your name and contact details in your portfolio so anybody who is interested will know how to get in touch with you.

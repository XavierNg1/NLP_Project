 Some forms of denaturation are permanent, while others can be undone. Cooking an egg or meat, for example, cannot be undone, but a protein that has been exposed to a high pH may regain shape when put in a more neutral environment., Return the environment around the protein to stasis and remove the denaturing element. Remove the acid or base, for example, or bring the protein back to a more reasonable temperature., Many laboratory supplies companies sell renaturation kits that allow you to screen for the best parameters to encourage renaturation. Such kits can be especially helpful if you are looking at proteins in a laboratory or experimental setting.

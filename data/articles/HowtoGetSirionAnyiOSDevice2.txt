 If your iDevice does not support Siri, you can still install apps that will give you approximately the same functionality. Dragon Go!, a product from a company called Nuance, is one of the more popular alternatives.


Siri is built off of Nuance technology, so Dragon Go! contains many of the same features as Siri and has similar voice recognition capabilities.Dragon Go! can access many of your other apps, such as Netflix, Google, Yelp, and more.
 The Google Search app comes with voice command software that allows you to start Google searches. It does not interact with any of your other apps, but can be used extensively for web searching..

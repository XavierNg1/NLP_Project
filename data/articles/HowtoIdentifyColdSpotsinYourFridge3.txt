 Food directly beneath cooling vents will receive the brunt of the cold, which may cause freezing. In most cases, you can find the cold air vent above or to the side of the top shelf.Many of these vents will have a slatted or narrow opening through which the cold air passes.
If you have difficulty identifying the cold air vent in your refrigerator, open the door and feel around potential vent areas with your hand. If you feel cold air being emitted, you've likely found the vent.
 Your freezer can influence the coldness of your refrigerator, especially for refrigerator models with a freezer at the bottom. By raising the temperature of your freezer, you could solve your cold spot problem.Be sure not to raise the temperature of your freezer above freezing (32°F/0°C). This can cause bacteria to grow and food to spoil faster than normal., The food in your refrigerator acts like a sponge for the cold air. The more food you have in it, the more evenly distributed the cold air will be. Keeping your refrigerator more fully stocked could be a simple solution to your fridge's cold spots.This is especially true for the bottom of your fridge, where cold air can build up and cause freezing. Make sure the bottom of your fridge is well stocked.

The manufacturer information for your refrigerator can usually be found in its user manual.
If you cannot determine the manufacturer of your fridge, inquire with the retailer that sold it to you to determine this information.

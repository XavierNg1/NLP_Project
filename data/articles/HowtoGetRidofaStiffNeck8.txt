 Many people suffer from a stiff neck because their work setup is not ergonomic. Position your chair so that you sit with your feet flat on the floor and your arms rest on your desk.


If you have a computer monitor, make sure it is at eye level.
 If you sit at a desk all day or you spend a lot of time in the car, take a lot of short breaks. Moving around gives your muscles a chance to stretch out instead of remaining rigid for hours on end.
 Craning your neck downwards constantly can slowly harm your neck. Instead, try holding your phone or tablet up in front of you at eye level.
 Carrying a lot of weight on one shoulder will disproportionately strain one side of your body over the other. Your neck and back will compensate for the weight and this can result in a stiff neck. Instead, choose a backpack or a small rolling suitcase.
 Lifting weights improperly is a common cause of stiff necks. You can strain your muscles or pinch a nerve if you don't use a safe technique. Work with an instructor to make sure you're using the right form.


Don't try to lift more weight than you can handle. Lifting shouldn't be easy, but you also shouldn't feel like you're going to topple forward. Find the appropriate weight for your body type and strength level.
Don't lift too many times per week. Your muscles need time to repair between workout sessions. You can overstrain yourself if you work out too often.

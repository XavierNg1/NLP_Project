 To make the head of the rocket, take a 2 centimeter (0.8 in) wide strip of kitchen aluminum foil.Tear a rectangle by 2x3 centimeters.Then, make a fold for 0'5 centimeter (2.0 in) along both longer sides. Once this is completed, wrap the head of the match tightly.Twist the upper part of the match to get a quite cool pointed tip. The cool pointed tip should look similar to a cool looking rocket.


Take your thumbnail and strike the three matchsticks with your thumbnail. This way you can create a nice tripod. It is recommended that you keep the heads together and roll the foil over them tightly (3-4 times is enough). Follow the same procedure mentioned above and proceed as if you were creating a single head rocket.;
, During the first stages of creating a single head rocket, an adult should be around to help you and to supervise with the project should an accident occur when creating a single rocket head.
, It's great fun because it might topple down,and might not ignite or it could be a real success.

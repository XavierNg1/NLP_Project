 Don't forget to make a shelter for the TV and make sure the weather is gonna be sunny and warm.;
, Invite all of your buddies that like wrestling, tell them all the information they need about the party, like the time, date of your party, and where you live. Go get some food, like McDonald's and buy loads of food. Make sure to bring some varieties in your food just in case someone doesn't like a certain type of food. Get it all home and put all the food on a table. Be sure to provide plates, napkins, cups, and utensils.
 get 4 mattresses or 2 depending on how many you have, lay them on the grass next to each other, this is the ring.
 If you don't, then you might have Bravo or some other channel that TNA is broadcasted on.
 You can use chairs, bean bags, or whatever makes your guests comfortable. Don't make it like a cinema where the seats are all behind in rows. Make the seats next to each other to surround the TV, so everyone can see.
, Pretend you're in the WWE. Have a stereo or boom-box handy so when you're pretending to make your entrances, all the wrestlers music to do an entrance too.
, If they say yes, then you have made the perfect wrestling party!

If you purchased and downloaded Norton online, then the product key is in your confirmation e-mail. If it is not in your inbox, then check your spam folder.
If you purchased a physical copy of Norton, then the product key is inside the box. It can be printed on a sticker on the back of the CD case or printed on a card inside the box.;
, Locate the Norton icon on your desktop and double-click it.


The Norton product window will appear.
 At the bottom part of the window that appeared, click the yellow-colored “Renew” link.
 This button will be on the small window that will appear after clicking “Renew.”


After clicking “Renew,” the subscription window will show.
 On the subscription window, enter the product key on the field at the bottom of the screen.

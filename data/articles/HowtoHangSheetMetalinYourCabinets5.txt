 Make sure both bonding surfaces are clean by cleaning with a household window cleaner.


Clean thoroughly, to avoid poor adhesion.
 Cut strips of carpet tape about ½” shorter than the vertical height of the metal panel.


On the bonding face of the metal, press the strip of tape in place about ¼” in from the edge with the ends of the strip about ¼” from the top and bottom of the metal panel.
 Cut two strips at a length nearly equal to the space between the two strips you just placed.


Press them into place along the top and bottom edges of the metal.
 Cut and place two strips about 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm) long somewhere in the center portion of the metal.


Peel the protective film off all the strips you just mounted.
Be careful not to get them dirty or they may not stick properly.
 Carefully place one edge into position along the reference lines you drew when measuring for the metal.


Once the metal is in the proper position, you may bond the entire metal panel to the door.
Once the two surfaces are bonded, it is difficult to peel the metal away without damaging it.
If you need to remove the metal, heat the metal with a hair dryer to soften the adhesive.
Wear gloves when removing sheet metal panels.

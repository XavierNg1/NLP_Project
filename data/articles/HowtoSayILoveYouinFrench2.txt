 Often "I love you" is accompanied by something else, something extra. Make it even more memorable by adding a special touch.


"Je t'aime, toi" emphasizes that you love them and only them.
Follow with "my darling":

To a woman -- ma chérie (ma shay-ree)
To a man -- mon chéri (mo(n) shay-ree; the (n) is nasal)


"Mon amour" -- my love (moh(n) ah-mohr)
"Ma belle" -- my love (mah bell)
"Mon chou" -- my cabbage, my pastry (moh(n) shoo) (informal)

, You do not have to stick to the literal "I love you." There are dozens of ways to express how you feel, though a bit more complicated.


"Je t'aimerai pour toujours" -- I will love you forever (zhuh tem-air-ay poor too-zhoor)
"T'es l'amour de ma vie"" -- You're the love of my life (teh lah-moor duh ma vee)
"Je t'aime plus qu'hier et moins que demain" -- I love you more than I did yesterday and less than I will tomorrow (zhuh tem ploo kee-air ay mwahn kuh duh-mahn)

, The conversation doesn't stop there! Get ready for a response or to inquire further.


"Est-ce que tu m'aimes?" -- Do you love me? (ess kuh too mem)
"Moi aussi, je t'aime." -- I love you too. (mwah ah-see, zhuh tem)
"Veux-tu m'épouser?" -- Will you marry me? (voo too may poo say)

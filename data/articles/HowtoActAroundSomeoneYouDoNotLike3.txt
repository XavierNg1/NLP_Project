 You do not have to stay involved in a conversation with someone you do not like, but you should not simply blow them off. Politely excuse yourself from the conversation by letting that person know that you have other matters that also need your attention at that moment.Let them know something like, “It was nice to catch up, but I have to excuse myself. I have some pressing matters that I need to take care of.”
Remember that you are not obligated to disclose any information that you do not want. If they start asking about your personal life or plans that you do not want to talk about, simply let them know, “I’m not comfortable talking about that right now.”

, Making up excuses might seem like the easy way to get out of conversation or social obligation with this person, but lying is not only improper, it creates a burden for you since you have to remember the story and possibly create further fabrications. Avoid lying and instead be polite but honest when speaking with this person.


If this person asks you to hang out, for example, you don’t need to say, “No, because I don’t like you.” Instead, opt for an honest but less offensive response such as, “I don’t feel like hanging out tonight.”

, When you are trying to be polite, it can be tempting to make promises such as, “Not now but definitely another time,” or, “I can’t talk right now but I’ll text you later.” Try not to make promises you do not intend to follow through on. This is both disrespectful to the other person, and may encourage them to come around later trying to engage you.


Instead of making false promises, simply stop your statements short. Try, “I don’t think I can tonight,” instead of, “I don’t think I can tonight but maybe next week.”

 With a serrated knife, cut the noodle in half lengthwise. To get a straight cut, consider cutting along one side of the noodle. Then use the first cut to guide the knife as you cut the other side. This should give you two even halves with grooves down the middle.If you want to do four lanes, you can cut another noodle in the same way. You can repeat this step to create as many tracks as you want.
 Lay the noodles side by side on a flat surface. Take a hot glue gun and run a bead of glue just below the cut on one of the noodle halves. With the groove facing up, press the sides of the noodle halves together, squishing the glue between them. Hold for a few seconds.


Repeat this step to attach any additional tracks.
 Take your construction paper and cut out some small triangles with a pair of scissors. Tape or glue the triangles to toothpicks and then stick them along the side of the track. Finally, cut out a rectangular piece that is about the width of the two tracks and attach a toothpick to each end. Write “Finish” on one side of the paper and stick it at the bottom end of the track., Place the track on a chair, table, bench, or anything that gives it some downward slope. The higher the angle, the faster the cars will go. Have your kids place their cars at the top of the track and then let go of them to race.

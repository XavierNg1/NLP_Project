 Most wireless providers let you quickly call the carrier directly from your mobile phone without having to enter in a long phone number. Use the code for your service to connect directly to your carrier's customer service department:


T-Mobile - 611
Sprint - *2
Verizon - *611
Cricket - 611
AT&T - 611
Vodafone UK - 191

, Canceling your service will deactivate your phone. If you are switching to a new carrier or phone, make sure that you have ported your number over to your new phone already.


Canceling your account may result in early termination fees if you have not completed your contract.
You may be able to suspend your phone and prevent it from being used and charges from accruing, but this may require you to report it lost or stolen.

 In your grocery cart, keep raw poultry, meat, fish, or seafood away from foods that do not need to be cooked before eating.
 The tray should be big enough to catch any juices that may run off as a result of the defrosting process. This will prevent the juices from running and ruining other foods in your fridge.


To be extra safe, place the tray on the bottom shelf of the fridge while defrosting.
 Use a separate cutting board for raw poultry/meat/fish/seafood than you do for other ingredients.


Glass or plastic cutting boards are best for cutting easily contaminated foods. Wooden ones are more porous, meaning that it's easier for the contaminated juices to get trapped in them.
Consider using disposable cutting sheets when cutting raw poultry/meat/fish/seafood to protect your cutting board from contamination.
 As soon as possible after use, wash your cutting board in hot, soapy water or run it through the dishwasher. To be extra careful, you should also cover the board with a mixture of 1 teaspoon chlorine bleach to 1 quart water. Let stand for 2 to 3 minutes before rinsing thoroughly.
 This should be always be done immediately before cooking. Minimizing the amount of time the stuffing spends in contact with the raw meat will prevent bacteria from contaminating the stuffing.
 If you wish to serve it as sauce, bring to a rolling boil. Keeping it at a boil, stir for at least a minute before serving.
 Never put cooked food on a plate that was used for raw poultry, meat, fish, or seafood unless the plate has been thoroughly washed first.

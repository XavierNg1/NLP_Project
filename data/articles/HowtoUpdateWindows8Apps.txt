 On the "Start" screen, look for the bright green Windows Store tile sporting the shopping bag icon. You will know that there are updates available to apps when you see a number displayed on the live tile. That number represents the number of apps with available updates.;
, If you have decided to update your apps, just click on the "Store" tile. Once you’re in, look to the upper right corner where you will see the word “Updates” and again the number of updates available. If you don’t, it simply means that there are no updates active just yet.
 If you see “Updates” in the upper-right corner, click on it to access the individual apps available for updating.
 Available apps are all selected by default. You can click on “Install” to update all applications, or you can also just choose the ones you want, and deselect individually the other apps you don’t want.
, Check the progress meter for the status for each application update. Those that are done updating will then no longer appear on the update screen. Once all Windows 8 applications are updated, you will no longer see a number on the Windows Store tile on the "Start" screen until such time when new updates become available.

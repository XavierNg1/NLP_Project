 Set up the fraction so that the number of miles is in the numerator. This should be given to you. The rate should be per hour, so you should have a 1 in the denominator.For example if you are converting 50 miles per hour to feet per second, your ratio will look like this:50miles1hour{\displaystyle {\frac {50{\text{miles}}}{1{\text{hour}}}}}.
 Every mile has 5,280 feet in it, so to convert, multiply the number of miles by 5,280.Rewrite your ratio in terms of feet per hour.

For example, if you are converting 50 miles per hour, you would calculate 50×5,280=264,000{\displaystyle 50\times 5,280=264,000}, So, your new ratio is 264,000feet1hour{\displaystyle {\frac {264,000{\text{feet}}}{1{\text{hour}}}}}.
 Since an hour has 3,600 seconds, to convert you would multiply the number of hours by 3,600. Since you are working with a unit rate of 1 hour, you would simply multiply 1 and 3,600. Rewrite your new ratio in terms of feet per seconds

For example, 1×3,600=3,600{\displaystyle 1\times 3,600=3,600}. So, your new ratio is 264,000feet3,600seconds{\displaystyle {\frac {264,000{\text{feet}}}{3,600{\text{seconds}}}}}.
 The unit rate is feet per 1 second. This means you must get the denominator of your fraction to 1. To do this, divide the numerator by the denominator. You can also think of it as dividing the numerator and denominator by the denominator.

For example, 264,000feet3,600seconds=73.33feet1second{\displaystyle {\frac {264,000{\text{feet}}}{3,600{\text{seconds}}}}={\frac {73.33{\text{feet}}}{1{\text{second}}}}}. So, 50 miles per hour converts to 73.33 feet per second.

 As you progress, you'll find that your routine is just too easy. It may be tempting to be content with that, but push yourself. When you notice that you can go harder, do so. Doing what you couldn't do before will feel good.


Though it'll take a bigger chunk out of your schedule, allow your body plenty of time to warm up and cool down. For the actual workout, listen to your stamina: Do what you can and progressively work to more, about 60 minutes of exercise 5 or so days a week., Maybe your workout routine includes various activities, such as walking, bicycling or rowing. But don't stop there. Take a weekend hike with your family or spend an evening ballroom dancing. It all counts.


As you explore activities, you'll most likely find something that tickles your fancy. When you do, latch onto it. Was swing dancing surprisingly enjoyable? Great! That's one more hour each week you'll stay moving. The more the merrier, after all.
 Realistically, if you're starting a new workout routine, you're gonna get worn out. At the beginning it's very important to know what you're capable of and listen to your body. If you hurt yourself, there's no more getting in shape.


If you feel pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or nausea, take a break. You may be pushing yourself too hard. While that may be tempting for faster results, you'll get zero results if you're down for the count.

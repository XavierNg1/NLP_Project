 Rich browns often impart a polished, sophisticated sense. A combination of two shades of accent black, a muted gray, and two brown tones will give the impression of warm calmness.This particular color scheme designed to simulate the polished wood that used to be common in studies, libraries, and sitting rooms.
 Use a cyan, a dark blue, and a black for the base of this color scheme. Accent these base colors with beige and a muted red, which here represents fruit. The beige will tone down the energy of the red. The resulting color scheme should be cool, refreshing, and upbeat.


To shift this color scheme to something lighter and more playful, you might swap red for a burnt orange., The colors of the beach are sure to have a relaxing, calming influence. Start with a sandy brown color at the bottom. Above this, use a light blue. Continue to progress through darker shades of blue until you reach a very dark blue, like midnight blue.


The gradient of these colors gives the illusion of sand on the ground and water disappearing off into the distance.

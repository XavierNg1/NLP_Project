 Your vet will probably recommend that you not feed your cat for about six hours before the test. This will prevent buildups of fat droplets in the blood that appear after eating. These fat droplets can interfere with the test’s outcomes., Your cat should not be dehydrated before the blood test, or it could alter the results. Shortly before your cat gets its blood drawn, provide it with a water dish. If it is dehydrated, it will drink from the dish., Getting your cat excited and active just before it gets its blood test might throw off the test’s results. Therefore, wait until your cat’s blood test has concluded to frolic and play with your cat., There are several ways to minimize your cat’s stress. You could bring it to the vet’s office in a carrier, where it will feel safe and secure. You could also talk to your pet in a calm, reassuring voice. For instance, you might say, “Don’t worry, good cat.” When you take your cat out of its carrier, stroke it gently and reassuringly. Move your hand from its head down to its back as you pet it.The presence of other animals might upset your cat. You might want to leave your cat in the car if the waiting room is crowded.

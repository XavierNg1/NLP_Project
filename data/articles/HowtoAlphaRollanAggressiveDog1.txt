 You can try to relax your dog by telling them that everything is all right. Use a soothing, calm tone to reassure your dog. The gentleness of your voice may help reduce stress and relax them in a tense situation.;
, If your dog is growling, snapping, or snarling at another person or animal, the best thing you can do is remove them from the situation. Place them in a different room. If you are outside, you can lead them away on their leash. Use commands, such as “come, boy”, to make them follow you away., If you have trained your dog to answer to commands, you may be able to distract them from the target of their aggression. Use a command to have them lay down. If they do so, reward them by praising them, petting them, or giving them a treat.


At this point, you might also ask them to rollover. If they do so, you have successfully distracted them from their target and do not need to use a physical rollover.
 Yelling at the dog, jerking their leash or collar, or hitting the dog will not reduce their aggression in a tense situation. These punishments may provoke your dog more. Even if these methods temporarily stop the situation, they can encourage fearful or aggressive behavior later on.

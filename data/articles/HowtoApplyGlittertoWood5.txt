 Mod Podge is one of the most recognizable crafting supplies on the market. It is similar to glue, but it also seals and adds a finish. There are a number of different finishes that you can choose. For a glitter project, you should use either the Classic Gloss or the Hard Coat finish.Hard Coat finish is best for objects that are going to be handled frequently and is the most durable., Using a cheap paintbrush or a foam wedge, apply a thin coat of Mod Podge to the area of the wood that you want to glitter., While the Mod Podge is still wet, either sprinkle or use a foam wedge to add glitter. You can add as much or as little glitter as you’d like.
 Mod Podge has to ‘cure’ to dry. This means that while it might feel dry to the touch after an hour, it still needs several more hours before you should handle the wood. Hard Coat Mod Podge takes 72 hours to cure, so leave your newly glittered item in a safe place while it is curing.

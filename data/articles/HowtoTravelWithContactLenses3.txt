 Once you have reached your accommodations, you should find a good, clean place to store your lenses. Make sure that they will not become lost or dirty.


If you are staying in a hotel, you might keep them next to the sink.
If you are at a hostel or otherwise sharing a bathroom, you might want to keep your case in your luggage.
 Whether you are putting in or taking out your lenses, always wash your hands first.


If you are traveling to a place where clean water might not be freely available, try using a drop or two of your contact solution to rinse your fingertips before touching your lenses.
Hand sanitizers contain alcohol, which can damage your contact lenses.
 Water and sand can get into your lenses and irritate your eyes. If you are going swimming or to the beach, remove your lenses before you go.You can wear your eyeglasses on land, but you should not wear either glasses or lenses in the water.Swimming in contact lenses can also lead to eye infections, which can be expensive to treat while abroad.Alternatively, if you are not swimming at the beach, you can wear sunglasses to prevent sand from blowing into your lenses.
 When you leave, make sure to bring your lenses with you! Make a list of things you do not want to forget, and put your lenses and solution on the list. Go over this list before you check out of your accommodation.

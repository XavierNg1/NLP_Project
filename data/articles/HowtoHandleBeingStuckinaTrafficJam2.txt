 As the driver, you have the unique responsibility of getting you and/or the passengers to your destination safely. When you get into a traffic jam don't think of it as a waste of time, instead, think of it as getting more time to spend with your family/other passengers.
 If you know that an there is a traffic jam on a road you're going to use or it's rush hour, try to find an alternative route using a G.P.S or a map. If you can avoid the jam altogether.
 Take your mind off the stress of the traffic jam by listening to something you enjoy. The more engaged you are in the listening material, the faster it'll seem like time passes.
 Just keep in mind that switching lanes only for the sake of it is likely to make the traffic jam worse; only switch if you have a real reason to or there is some kind of obstruction in your lane.
 If the traffic is extremely bad most people recommend just waiting until the next exit lane, and finding the nearest fast food restaurant and just eating there until traffic gets better.
 It's easy to get frustrated as a driver in a traffic jam. Deep breathing can help you stay calm and feel more focused.
 If the traffic is really at a standstill, it's fairly safe to let your mind wander, just a little. It's a good time to get your creative juices flowing; make your mental to-do list or start brainstorming solutions to the problems you've got at work or home. Just be ready to jump back into action when traffic starts moving.
 If you're not driving solo, strike up a conversation or participate in a road game with them. Again, just be ready to focus on driving once you get rolling.

 When eating like a caveman, you do need to take caution with starchy tubers, better known as potatoes and squashes. While these vegetables aren’t bad for you, they are not as good for you as non-starchy vegetables due to the amount of carbs and sugars they contain. Starchy vegetables that should be enjoyed in moderation include:


Butternut squash, corn squash
Yams, sweet potatoes
Beets.

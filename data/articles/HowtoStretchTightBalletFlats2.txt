 The socks will help expand the shoes.


This method is best for shoes that are just a little too snug.
Use caution for this method. If the soles are glued on, the heat from the hairdryer can cause the glue to weaken and the soles to peel away., Focus on the tight sections, such as the toes. The heat will help soften the material and make it more pliable., They will feel even more snug than before, but after you stretch them, they will feel just right.
 Give your toes a wiggle from time to time to help loosen them further. As the shoes cool down, they will retain the shape of your foot. This can take a while. Be patient, and don't take them off until they have completely cooled down.
 They should be a bit larger than before, and more comfortable to wear. If they are still too snug, repeat the whole process again.

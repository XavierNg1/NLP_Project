, These two locations are the only two locations that will allow you to transfer to the airport. The trains on LIRR from Penn Station will take about 20-25 minutes to arrive, and the trains come pretty much on time every 20 minutes from other stations nearby.


There will eventually be service to the LIRR at Grand Central Terminal, about 5 blocks away. However, this is only a planned station as of August 25, 2014.
 The trip from the Jamaica station to the airport takes about 10 minutes. However, the location at the airport will depend on how many people arrive on the train with you and who gets on and who gets off at these intended destinations, so it could take a little bit longer.

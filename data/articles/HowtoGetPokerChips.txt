 If it's a regular weekly game, it makes sense to invest in some decent chips. If it's for the ski house and gets used twice a year, cheap plastic ones will do fine, unless only the best will do for you.;
, 80 chips per player is a good rule of thumb, with 40 in one color, and 20 each in two other colors.
 The standard red, white and blue set of thin light plastic chips won't win any style points but will work just fine. Expect to pay up to $20 to buy enough chips.
 Expect to pay $50 - $100 with shipping for 500 chips of this style in varied colors with a decent carrying case. eBay can be a good source but be careful of fraudsters.
 These come in a variety of sizes and weights. The best are 100% clay chips, but these will be fairly expensive. The Gambler's General Store in Las Vegas is a good source with a lot of variety or you can order most chips over the internet from various stores including Amazon.com. Also, a lot of local high-end game stores will carry clay chips. Expect to pay $.50 - $1.50 a chip, more for a case to carry them, and realize that not all chips are the same.
 This could be your company logo, or the name of your weekly game, or your initials. Be aware that this will be more expensive.

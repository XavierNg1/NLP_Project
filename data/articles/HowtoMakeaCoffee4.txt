 Measure out 6 to 8 ounces (177 to 23 ml) of water and bring it to a boil in either a kettle or a saucepan over medium heat. The ideal water temperature for making coffee is about 200 F (93 C).
 In a coffee mug, stir together the instant coffee granules and cold water. Set the mug aside to let the coffee dissolve as the water boils.


Mixing the coffee with cold water first helps the granules dissolve more slowly, and this creates a more flavorful cup of coffee that doesnâ€™t taste like instant., When the water boils, add it to your mug of dissolved instant coffee. Stir to combine the water and coffee, and add your favorite coffee fixings before serving.

 Putting make-up on can dry out your skin, creating a less than professional look. Moisturizers can make your skin smooth and healthy.;
, Many different colors of eyes look better with certain colors, you should base your eyeshadow color based on the color(s) of your outfits, too (except when you have one good look to complete your face and match everything!). From light blue to deep brown, the safest way to go is with a color matching your skin tone. For the full look, put your medium shade on just your lid, then sweep a darker color across crease, then dust the lightest shade in your inner eye corners and beneath your eyebrow. Be careful not to open your eye too wide, you might crease it, leaving an extremely visible mark!

, You wouldn't want your lips to go bare and chapped! Buy a Chapstick Classic to not only hydrate your lips but also, the flavors are super yummy! Soft Lips are also wonderful; they have yummy flavors and are tinted. Lip Smackers work awesome, too! I suggest you wear a nice lip balm beneath your gloss for extra care and softness.
 Lipsticks are less clear and metallic than this. Put on a clear or light lip gloss to highlight your natural color. Also, go for sheer pinks and corals. Never put on vivid colors. Try to look for more natural and naked tones that match your lip tone well.
 Wear mascara and curl your eyelashes to make your eyes look bigger and more open. One coat may not be enough. So you may do 2 coats. Remember, not to overdo and clump. Use a lash brush if clumping occurs. .
 If you wish to use eyeliner use a gray, or lightly apply black eyeliner.,

 Chick starter provides more protein and a balanced diet for your chicks to grow properly. Give them chick starter everyday until they are 6-8 weeks old.


Don't give your chicks a lot of feed as they are small and do not need as much as the older chickens.
Do not feed your chicks straight after they are born, feed them a day after hatching.
There are two types of chick starters, medicated and non-medicated. Consider giving them medicated if your chicks have suffered from coccidiosis in the past.
 Fully-grown hens do not need the special chick starter as they do not require as much protein, but there is a number of things that you can supply them with.


Mix crushed oyster shells in their feed for calcium so that they can lay healthy eggs (this is important if their eggs are soft).
Provide grit to grind down their food. Grit is only needed if your hens live in a shed or coop all their life, if they are free-ranged they will not need this as most of their diet is made up on the stuff they find in the ground.
Provide your hens with laying pellets at about 8 months old. Laying pellets is good for them to lay healthy and yummy eggs.
Give your chickens table scraps.They love it and its very good for them, just be aware that they cannot eat some foods such as citrus fruits, avocado, garlic, onions or raw potatoes.
 Make sure the water is not too deep for your chickens as they can fall in and drown, a water-feeder is best in this case.


Clean the feeder once a week (or every 2 weeks) and fill it with fresh water everyday.
Provide more than one water feeder if you have over 10 chickens. If you have free-ranged chickens provide one outside and one inside their coop.

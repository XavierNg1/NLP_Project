 To make a clay model of a cell, you’ll need:


A small or medium sized styrofoam ball.
A package of colorful clay (feel free to also use Play Doh or Crayola’s Model Magic)
Toothpicks
Labels

, The size of the ball you use depends on how detailed you want to make the parts.Keep in mind a larger styrofoam ball will give you more room and flexibility to work.
 You can cover the entire half piece of Styrofoam with clay if you want to make the top of the ball a certain color.
 It may be helpful to have a print out or image of the cell to ensure all of the cell components are represented.


Be sure to use different colored clay for each component to distinguish them from each other.
Add the components to the flat side of the styrofoam using toothpicks.
If you're making a plant cell, remember to add a cell wall to your model.
 You can do this by taping the labels to toothpicks or pins and sticking the pins into the styrofoam ball next to the applicable component.

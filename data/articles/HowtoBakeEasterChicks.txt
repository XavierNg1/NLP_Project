 Knead for about 5 minutes on a floured surface. If using your own bread dough, follow the instructions of the recipe for making it; just be sure to have the same amount as advised in the ingredients list above.;
,, For each separate piece of dough:


Remove 1/8 of the dough. This will become the chick's head. The larger piece forms the chick's body.
Roll both pieces of dough into a ball shape.
For the larger ball, push out a hole in the middle to make a dough ring. This piece should look like a doughnut.
, Dab a little beaten egg onto the base of the small ball and a little to the top of the dough ring. Attach the small ball to the dough ring, to form the bird's head.
 Push in one currant where an eye looks best. Add a beak by pushing in two almond halves to the side of the face, in a slightly opened position.
 You should have six dough chicks on the sheet now.
 Allow the dough to rise in a warm place. It needs to double in size.
 Boil the eggs for 5 minutes. Then remove from the heat and allow to cool.
, Then, brush the dough with the remaining beaten egg.
 They should sit at the top of the oven in the middle. Bake for around 10 to 15 minutes, or until they appear golden.
 Cool on a wire cooling rack.
 Once cooled, use the paintbrush and good coloring to apply designs and patterns to the eggs. This part is especially fun for children, and it doesn't matter what they paint as long as they enjoy it.
 The Easter chicks are ready to serve at the table once the eggs are painted. For display, simply add to a display, such as sitting in a pretty basket.

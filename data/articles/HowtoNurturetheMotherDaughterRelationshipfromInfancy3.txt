 Raising a daughter who is in no doubt of the fact that you love her accustoms her to a loving, supportive relationship with you; if she gets used to hearing and saying the words “I love you” from a young age, she will know that your love is one thing she never has to worry about losing.
 Especially while your daughter is an infant, cover her with kisses, embrace her on a regular basis, and incorporate cuddle time into your regular nap time routine. As she grows older, never stop hugging her, in both the good times and the bad. The power of touch remains important throughout your lives together.


These physical expressions of love not only teach your daughter how to show and accept affection, but they also accustom her to a relationship with her mother that values regular hugs and kisses.
As a bonus, physical affection will release more oxytocin, cementing your mother-daughter bond with chemical reinforcement.
 Your daughter will know the difference between attentive listening and making a pretense at listening. If you cannot set aside time to listen to something she has to say at a certain moment, suggest making a time when you will be free to sit down and talk, and then make good on that. Let her know that what she has to say is valued and that you will always make the time for her.

 Get a teapot with a tea basket that sit on the top. Add enough boiling water so that it doesn't touch the top basket and ruin the tobacco. Put the tobacco in the basket. Cover the teapot and leave it sit for 30 minutes.


Check the tobacco to see if it is moist enough. Leave the tobacco in longer if it isnâ€™t.;
, Pre-heat a steam iron to the hottest setting. Place a newspaper on a heat resistant surface. Spread your tobacco out onto the newspaper. Use a spray nozzle to spray the tobacco with water once or twice.


Hold the iron above the tobacco and let steam for 10 seconds.
Be careful not to touch the iron to the tobacco.
 Put the tobacco in a clean, stainless steel salad bowl. Wet the tobacco using a spray-bottle, and spray a fine mist over the tobacco 3 - 4 times. Mix up the tobacco with a spoon or spatula. Place the tobacco in a large jar with a vacuum-seal rubber-gasket lid that screws down.

Heat the jar by putting it into an oven set at 200 F (~100 C) for 20 minutes or until jar feels hot to the touch. Let the jar stand for ten minutes.
Remove the jar and let it cool overnight in a cool, dry place. Do not open until the next morning.
Be sure to pack the tobacco down tightly and seal the lid tightly.

 Developing a normal cleaning routine will prevent debris, oil, and dirt from building up. Daily cleaning makes your eyewear easier to maintain and extend their lifespan. Further, cleaning your eyewear from lenses to earpieces regularly will prevent them from becoming discolored and lower the risk of eye infection., Use specific towels or cloths for cleaning your glasses, and don’t use them for other purposes. Clean them every few days to make sure they’re not harboring any particles that could damage your lenses or anti-glare coating. Keep cloths handy when you’re on the go, but make sure to use them in tandem with tap water or a generous amount of spray cleaner.Keeping cloths with you when you’re away from home will reduce the temptation to use napkins or other paper products, which don’t work very well and can leave small particles that might cause fine scratches.
 Keep a spray cleaning solution approved for anti-glare lenses for when you’re on the go and don’t have access to tap water and dish soap. Use plenty of the solution on your lenses before you do any wiping. Really soaking them will remove dust and dirt particles. Keep a lint-free cloth or microfiber towel handy to wipe your glasses after spraying them down with solution. Check the label or verify that the solution is anti-glare approved with your optometrist

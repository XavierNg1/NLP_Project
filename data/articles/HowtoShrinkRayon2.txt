 After you’ve washed your rayon fabric, you can simply lay it down flat on a counter for a while and wait for it to dry naturally.This may be your best option if you’re trying to only shrink the garment a little bit, or if you want to be extra cautious about making sure the shrinking occurs uniformly., You can dry your wet rayon by gently pressing out excess water and then hanging it on a clothes line to let the outdoor air dry it.

Avoid squeezing the water out because this could potentially create wrinkles and stretch the fabric out unevenly.
This method may make the fabric stretch the most lengthwise.
 Put your wet rayon garment in the dryer on the gentle setting until it’s completely dry. Drying your fabric in this way will most likely allow for the greatest possible amount of shrinkage.

 You never waste that many gold pieces, and if you do, it's going to be on food or new armor or weapons. You can also hit mid range damage.;
, Ranging can be a little expensive because you have to buy arrows (unless you're a member and can make them). However, bows aren't too expensive, unless you're talking about the dark bow. (1.75m as of 1/19)

, You can hit very high damage but it is expensive. You have to buy runes; some are not very cheap and you need to buy lots of them. However, like ranging, it can be very easy to train if you fight something that doesn't have ranged attacks itself easily. All you have to do is go to a place where you see it but can't exactly get to it. An example is like in the Varrock sewers, there are zombies on the other side of the river or if you go to the edge of the dwarf mountain, you can see them but they can't get to you.

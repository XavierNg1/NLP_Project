 Schedule a “phone date” with a designated day and time to talk if you have busy schedules. During the call, ask them how everything is going and try not to dominate the conversation by talking about yourself the whole time. Plan your next time to chat before you get off the phone with them.


If you know a family member’s schedule, pick a day and time of the week that you’re both free and make an effort to talk on the phone at that time every week.
If you’re overseas and worried about racking up long-distance charges calling your family, look into companies that offer cheap long-distance call credits without making you switch service providers.;
, Use FaceTime or Skype if your family has access to them. Video chatting is the closest you can get to actually being with your family, and your family members will appreciate seeing your face.


You can download Skype for free if you or your family doesn’t have it. If both you and one of your family members has an iPhone or Mac computer, you can use FaceTime to video chat with each other., Texting doesn’t require the scheduling or commitment that phone calls and video chats do. Send your family members the occasional text message asking how they are and what they’ve been up to. Send picture messages of important things happening in your life, like pictures of your new house or your new pet.
 Send periodic group emails to your family members so they know how you’re doing. Use email to send large-sized videos and photo albums that are too big to text.


If you're traveling abroad or living in a new city, start a newsletter for your family. Include important news from your life in the newsletter and email it to your family members once a week.

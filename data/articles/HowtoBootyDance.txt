 Booty dancing is all about rhythm. If you are off the beat of the song you are dancing to, it will not sync well with the rest of the dance floor, and may become off time itself. The meter of the song is the rhythm that you want to dance with.;
, Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart and add just a slight bend to your knees. This will trigger the rest of the motions.
 Start with your hips. Like most forms of dancing, booty dancing is all about the hips. Move your hips backward so that your booty protrudes out behind you. While doing this, though, make sure you puff your chest out at the same time. Use your shoulders to enunciate your chest. Make the motion fluid and use your knees to balance and push you while you do this back and forth motion.
 Now when you pull forward and back, take it to the side a bit, alternating to the right and left. Now you are no longer just bouncing there, but actually dancing.
 You may hold your arms chest high with your hands in front of your chest and your elbows out or, alternatively just keep your hands in front of you.
 Bend your knees up and down as you do the back and forth motion. If you become more advanced, you can try methodically working your way up and down while you dance. This may be hard on your knees, but will win you respect on the dance floor every time.

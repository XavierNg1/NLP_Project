 Mix 2 tsp (10 ml) baking soda with 2 tsp (10 ml) liquid dish or laundry detergent. Stir well until completely combined.


The baking soda has an abrasive effect and scrubs off the dead skin cells stained with dye, revealing clean skin underneath.
The detergent attracts the dye molecules and cleans the skin by lifting the dye off.
Use a mild detergent with no added fragrances or dyes, if possible, to reduce the risk of irritation.
Do not apply near the eyes. This mixture is safest when used on areas other than the face.
 Use a cotton makeup remover pad to scrub the baking soda solution onto the dyed skin, applying it in a circular motion. Scrub the mixture over the dye using gentle pressure.


Use as much or as little of the baking soda mix as needed to coat the entire stained area of skin.
Rub for 30 to 90 seconds. Stop if you feel any tingling, burning, itching, or other signs of irritation.
You could also use a cotton ball or clean rag instead of a cotton pad.
 After scrubbing the dyed skin with the baking soda, wipe the area clean with a damp washcloth until all of the baking soda solution has been removed.


You may find it easier to rinse the skin under running water. If you rinse the baking soda off with running water, gently rub the area with your fingers to loosen the baking soda under the water.
 If the dye appears lighter but has not been completely removed, you may consider trying this method again.


If this method had no effect on the dye, however, attempt a different one.

 Your team also wants to stop the other team from getting down the court. Don't touch another player unless they touch you. If you want to move with the ball, dribble and don't stop unless you want to pass or shoot. Don't be afraid; be aggressive.;
, Even if you can't do anything else, get the ball so your team can have it.
 Whenever someone (whether on your team or not) shoots the ball, you can jump and get the ball so your team will be able be on offense and score.
 Passing to your teammates is one of the most important mechanics of basketball today. Bounce pass to a teammate who isn't near anyone so they can shoot unguarded.
 If you can start off shooting close to the rim, that's wonderful. Especially if you're smart, you can calculate the physics involved in using the backboard and force to properly allow a basketball to go through the hoop

, Sometimes, you can fool your opponents into thinking one thing with a well-timed fake. This will give your teammates time to get in position.
 What reputation? You've just started playing basketball, so they'll know you're not great. At the beginning of the game, you want to act like you don't know what you're doing so they don't guard you. This way, you'll be wide open when you get the ball to shoot.

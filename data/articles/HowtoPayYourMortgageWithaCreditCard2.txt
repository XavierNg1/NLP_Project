 You can’t buy a money order with a credit card. Instead, you’ll need to buy a PIN-enabled gift card using your credit card. Visa offers a PIN-enabled gift card that works for this method.You can’t buy just any old gift card. Instead, the card must say “debit” on it.
 There’s usually a limit you can load. For example, you can only load up to $1,000 a day on the card. There is also a $5,000 a month limit on these cards., Money orders are sold at many banks, grocery stores, and large retailers. You’ll have to find one that accepts debit cards. Not all of them do. For example, CVS has refused to sell money orders to people using debit cards.However, the U.S. Postal Service accepts debit cards for money orders, so that is a good option.When you pay, don’t wave around your gift card or tell the cashier that you’re using a “gift card.” Just pretend it is an ordinary debit card tied to a bank account and use it to buy your money order.
 Send the money order to your mortgage servicer. If the servicer is a large bank, then you can hand deliver your payment to the nearest branch.Make sure it has been received and the payment credited to your account.
 If you loaded $1,000 onto your debit card, you now have $1,000 owing on your credit card. If you don’t pay it off before the grace period ends, then you’ll end up owing more money. Pay your credit card off, in full, each month.

 If you're using Lightroom to adjust exposure and eventually blend multiple exposures, you can load the images directly from Lightroom to separate layers in Photoshop.
 Hold Ctrl/âŒ˜ Cmd and select each of the images that you want to transfer. You can select these images along the bottom of the Lightroom window.
 This will start Photoshop and begin loading each image into its own layer. This could take a while with a large number of images. The process is complete when each of the images has loaded and there are no blank layers.
 The Layers window on the right side of the screen will allow you to switch between your layers and edit them as you please.

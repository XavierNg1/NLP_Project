 She can buy you the supplies you need.;
, Your mother can show you how to do this, or if you are to embarrassed to ask her, simply pull your panties down to your knees, unwrap the packaging, slide off the sticker on the bottom of the pad and stick it to your underwear. The round side will go at the front.
 Remember that your vagina is not straight, it goes back towards your spine, so you might need to insert it vertically.
 You should also leave some supplies in a little make up bag that you can keep in your bag or your locker at school just in case you get your period. You may want to include Midol or Ibuprofen for cramps. Remember that to dispose of the supplies you need to: fold the sanitary napkin up (or just leave the tampon like it is) and throw it in a bin, or the box you see in public toilets or school toilets.
 On a heavy day you need to change the sanitary napkin every 2-3 hours. On a medium day, 3-4, and on a light day, 4-5. You can buy sanitary napkins in different absorbencies, but never leave a sanitary napkin there too long, as you will start smelling an unpleasant odor. Never leave a tampon in for more than 8 hours (2 on heavy days) as you will be at risk or TSS (see warnings). Also if you are going to use tampons you cannot use them all the time, as you need to give your vagina some time to air. Never use tampons at night, as might sleep through your night, therefore not changing your tampon for 8-12 hours.
 Remember that every girl is different, so try several different brands, not just the popular ones.

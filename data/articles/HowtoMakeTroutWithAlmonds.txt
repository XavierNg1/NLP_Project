 Open up the trout and stuff it with 1 or 2 slices of lemon and a small handful of fennel. Take the other trout and repeat the same thing.
 Tip the flour onto a large plate and place one of the trouts in the centre. Sprinkle over more flour and turn it over several times to cover well. Repeat with the second trout., Put the large frying pan on a medium heat and warm it through. Add 3/4 of the butter and let it melt. Place both trouts into the pan. Fry on both sides for 5 minutes or until golden brown. When cooked remove from the heat.,, Place the same pan back on a medium heat and pour in the almonds. Add the remaining butter and toss the pan a few times. Fry, moving constantly, until golden brown., Spoon the almonds and melted butter over both trouts. Garnish with a little greenery and some lemon wedges and serve.

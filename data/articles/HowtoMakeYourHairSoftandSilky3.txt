 Hair follicles produce natural oils that add shine and softness to your hair. Washing your hair repeatedly with harsh chemicals (such as those present in most shampoos) removes these oils. While these oils can build up and become greasy in appearance over time, washing your hair every day can also strip away the healthy oils. Try skipping a day or two between washes to help improve the look and feel of your hair.


If your hair is very fine or if you sweat a lot, then you should wash your hair every day.Use dry shampoo between washes to keep your hair looking fresh and clean.
People with fine and thin hair should wash their hair every other day while people with coarse or curly hair may only need to wash their hair once or twice a week.
 Conditioner can give you soft silky hair, so it is a good idea to leave a little on your strands. When you condition your hair, donâ€™t rinse it for too long. Try to rinse your hair until most of the conditioner is out, but your hair still feels slick. This will help to ensure that your hair stays soft and silky all day.You may also want to wring the excess water out of your hair before you apply conditioner. This will help to ensure that your hair soaks up as much conditioner as possible.
For fine or thin hair, only apply conditioner to your strands. Do not apply it to your roots.

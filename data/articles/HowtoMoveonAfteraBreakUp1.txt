 Even if the relationship was unhealthy, you need time to grieve. Accept and acknowledge feeling sad, angry, confused, frustrated and relieved.;
, Sometimes, people change when they are in relationships. Figure out what you like best about yourself as a single person and focus on making that part shine.
 You do not want your break up to send you spiraling into bad habits such as drinking, binge eating or obsessive exercise.


Take care of yourself by eating healthy food, getting enough sleep and working out when you can, even if that means just taking a walk.
 If your break up means you lose some mutual friends, that's okay. Talk to your good friends, family members and others who will stand by you during this difficult time.
 Some people are better able to identify their feelings and process the break up with the help of a mental health professional.

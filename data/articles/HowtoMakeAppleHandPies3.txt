 When the dough has chilled for at least 30 minutes, remove it from the fridge and place it on a floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll it out until the dough is ⅛-inch (3-mm).If you don’t have a rolling pin, you can use a full bottle of wine or other heavy jar to roll it out.
 Once the dough is rolled out, use a 5-inch (12.7-cm) round cookie cutter to cut the dough into circles. You should wind up with approximately 8 to 10 hands pies.It may be necessary to reroll the dough once or twice to cut out all of the circles.
 Place the dough rounds on your prepared baking sheets. Use a spoon to add approximately 1 heaping tablespoon (15 g) to the center of each circle, making sure that there’s a 1-inch (2.5-cm) border around.Be careful not to overfill the hand pies or the filling may leak out during baking.
Leave as much liquid from the filling behind when you add it to the dough.
 When the filling is in the center of the rounds, pull the dough over it to close the circles. Use your fingers or a fork to seal the dough so the filling doesn’t ooze out during baking.

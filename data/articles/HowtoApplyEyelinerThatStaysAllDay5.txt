 You may find that the problem with your eyeliner is not how you apply it, but that you are using a low-quality eyeliner. Some eyeliners are better than others. Poor-quality eyeliners do not have very long staying power and are more prone to smudging. They also may irritate your eyes, which causes watering and makes your eyeliner shift. Buy eyeliner from a makeup store like Sephora or Ulta. Their products are more expensive for a reason: it's because they are very high quality. There are good quality eyeliners at the drugstore, but you may want to do a little online research and read about others' experiences with the product.
 Waterproof liner is much more resistant than non-waterproof liner. It lasts activities like swimming and showering, but it also resists tearing or watering of the eyes. If you are using eyeliner on your waterline, make it's waterproof. , Liquid eyeliner is incredibly effective in not smudging. It goes on wet and after it dries it's extremely resistant to moving. Liquid liner gives a very crisp and uniform line, and is great for dramatic eye looks like cat eyes. It is best used on your upper last line. Liquid liners are not made to be used on your water line. Use a pencil liner instead.
Make sure to give your liquid liner time to dry. Do not put on any other eye makeup before it's dry, or you could smudge the liner.
 A gel liner has a consistency that is in between a pencil and a liquid eyeliner. Like a liquid liner, it has great staying power after it's dry and is therefore much less prone to smudging. It also can be used on the waterline, so if you are looking for an optimal liner for your waterline, consider a gel liner.

Stick to a few ideas in the beginning and let it evolve over time.;
, Having a script will help keep you on topic, make segment transitions smooth and keep you within a general time limit.


It can be fully scripted or a general outline of topics of discussion.
Most podcasts aim to hit a length of around an hour.
 This should be a quiet location with low outside noise.


Make sure there is ample room for you and whoever else is on your podcast.
Sound dampening panels can reduce background noise even further.

Most podcasts have a weekly or bi-weekly run.

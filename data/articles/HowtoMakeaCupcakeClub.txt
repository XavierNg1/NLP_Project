 Find a good name for the club, such as "Southern Heights Cupcake Club" and a motto, such as "We bake, decorate and share cupcakes for charity". Consider what you'll do together, such as making cupcakes from scratch in each other's kitchens, then selling them to neighbors or in the local farmer's market and donating the profits to a favorite charity. Or, you could just make cupcakes for fun, experimenting with different kinds of cupcakes. You might also consider making your own cupcake newsletter and maybe even a book on cupcakes some day.
 You'll need someone who organizes the meetings, someone who plans the meeting content, someone who gets ingredients or craft materials for activities, and so on. You can share the roles if you prefer, rather than making one or two people do all the work., Always know what you are doing. If you don't know what you are doing it will start to get boring. Always do something different each day you meet, such as:

Making cupcakes
Making up new kinds of cupcakes
Writing out recipes, sharing them online perhaps
Making a photo board of cupcakes you've all made
Making crafts that look like cupcakes, and so on.
 This might be a cupcake show that includes the neighbors or other people. Award prizes for the best cupcakes, using members of your club as the judges., Help people to join by making your club known. Include when the club meets, what happens there, and where you are meeting., Pass them around your neighborhood or place them up on lamp-posts. Always be sure to have your parent/guardian when you are hanging up your posters.

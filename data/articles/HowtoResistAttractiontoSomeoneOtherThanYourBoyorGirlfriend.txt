 Do kind, loving deeds for your partner. Consider buying a special gift for him/her and spend time doing things you enjoy together. Make the relationship mutually satisfying.;
, Think about all their positive traits, even make a list of them if it helps. This might be anything from how physically attractive you find them to a good sense of humour.
 Don't be rude, but definitely give the message that you are already taken.
 Give them a phone call, or arrange to spend some quality face-to-face time with them. Use your attention on the one you really love.

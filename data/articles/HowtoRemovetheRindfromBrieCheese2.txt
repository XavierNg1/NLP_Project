 This will protect it from freezer burn and keep the texture and flavor fresh. Use several pieces of plastic wrap and make sure the entire rind is covered.
 During this time the brie will harden, which will make it easier to remove the rind.


30 minutes is the minimum amount of time necessary to give the brie the chance to firm up. If you have more time, it's fine to freeze the brie for a few hours or even overnight.
 If the brie still feels soft, put it back in the freezer for another half hour. This method only works if the brie is completely firm. If it feels stiff to the touch, place the brie on a cutting board.
 Place the brie on a cutting board and use a serrated knife to slice the top off of the brie. Once you've made the cut, use your fingers to pry off the rind. If the brie is sufficiently firm, the top should be easy to cut off.


Slicing off just the top leaves a "bowl" for the creamy cheese to be scooped from when eating or preparing to serve. This same method can be used for a pie slice of brie as well. If preferred all the rind can be removed before cooking or serving.
Use caution to remove as little of the creamy cheese as possible and only remove the white dry rind.
 Put the brie in a baking dish and bake it for 15 to 20 minutes at 300 degrees. It should be shiny and creamy when done.
 Tart, sweet berry or orange jam perfectly complements the creamy, salty brie., Whole wheat or water crackers are both excellent with baked brie.

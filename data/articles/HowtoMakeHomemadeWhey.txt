, The whey will run into the bowl and the milk solids will stay in the strainer.Be sure the bowl is large enough to allow the strainer to hang over the bowl so that the curds don’t end up standing in the whey. Cover with a plate and let stand at room temperature for several hours (longer for yoghurt) until all the whey has drained.
 Don’t throw this away! Most of us are familiar with the old nursery rhyme, "Little Miss Muffet"…eating her curds and whey. Well this is what she was eating! Use the cheese as a spread. To give it some flavor, add garlic, chives, onion, and spices, along with a bit of salt and pepper. Pour the whey into a glass jar and cover tightly. Refrigerated, the cream cheese keeps for approximately one month and the whey for about six months.

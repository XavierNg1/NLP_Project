 When you initially shoot the deer, try to watch closely for the path it takes when it runs after being shot. Once it runs away, go toward the place you last saw it, probably the spot where it was shot, and look for signs of the deer. There should be at least some blood here, so it should be fairly simple to locate. .
 Try to figure out which way the deer when by looking for visible signs. Try to find evidence of blood on the ground or on nearby brush. There may also be broken branches and other disrupted vegetation as a result of the deerâ€™s hurried exit. If there are tracks and blood, follow them. Keep looking for the next sign of blood or the next set of tracks as you make your way toward the injured deer.


It is easier to track deer in the snow but it is still possible to track them out of it. You just need to look for signs of blood and disrupted/broken brush or vegetation.
 If you hit the deer in the gut, it is likely the deer will not die for a while as it will bleed to death. Be cautious when pursing a wounded animal; they are more unpredictable and can be dangerous. If you can, stay back and shoot it again in a fatal place when it has stopped to rest. You are aiming for a quick, humane kill.

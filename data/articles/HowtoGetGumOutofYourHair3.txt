 Dissolvers are somewhat less likely to be lying around your house, but they are also effective for removing gum.









Dissolvers include, but are not limited to, eucalyptus oil, rubbing alcohol, adhesive remover, baking soda with water, lemon juice, white vinegar, and mayonnaise., After the product has sat for awhile, begin breaking the gum apart with your fingers.









If the gum does not break apart, apply more and let it sit awhile longer. It should dissolve and break apart in your fingers.
 If the dissolvers have worked properly, they should come out with the use of your fingers. Clean the area afterward with a towel.









Cleaning the hair with a towel prior to shampooing is recommended for ease of washing.

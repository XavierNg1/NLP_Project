 Baking soda has long been used to deodorize clothing and to pre-treat stains. Adding one cup of baking soda to a load of laundry can help remove unwanted smells.


Sometimes simply adding baking soda to your wash cycle isn’t enough. For hard-to-remove odors, add ½ cup baking soda per gallon of water in a large bucket or sink. Be sure to swirl the clothes around to ensure they are fully submerged and to distribute the baking soda evenly throughout the mixture.
If you don’t have time to wash sweaty, smelly clothes immediately, sprinkle some baking soda on them before putting them into your laundry bin to control odors and absorb moisture.;
, Add about ¼ cup of white vinegar during the final rinse cycle to help remove odors from sweat, smoke, and bacteria., Use 1 part vodka to 1 part water and store the solution in a jug (don’t worry about long-term storage, your solution will last for a very long time). Next, pour some solution into a spray bottle and spray onto smelly clothes.


Do a spot-test first in a small, unnoticeable area to make sure this solution won't damage your clothes. This way to deodorize your clothes may not be ideal for certain fabrics, like leather or silk.
If you don’t have a spray bottle, they can usually be found at restaurant supply stores or anywhere commercial cleaning products are sold.
Although vodka is an effective deodorizer, it doesn’t clean your clothes or remove stains, so don't expect your solution to produce results in these areas.
 Use 1 cup of vinegar, 1 cup of water, and ½ teaspoon of your favorite essential oil. Tea tree, lavender, lemon, and grapefruit are all popular options. Pour your mixture into a spray bottle and spritz your clothes between wash cycles.

 Usually this is characterised by the clutch slipping as you apply power â€” the engine speed will increase greatly when you try to accelerate, even though the clutch pedal is not pressed. Under normal driving, a healthy clutch will 'lock' the engine to the transmission, so its speed should be directly linked to changes in the vehicle speed.;
, If your vehicle has a hydraulically-operated clutch, eliminate air in the system by bleeding the hydraulic circuit, as you would with the braking system. A cable-operated clutch could be suffering from a seized or jammed cable, preventing the clutch from taking the full torque from the engine.
 Clutch replacement is an involved job, requiring removal of the transmission to access the clutch. Unless you are an experienced home mechanic, book your car into a garage to have the work done.

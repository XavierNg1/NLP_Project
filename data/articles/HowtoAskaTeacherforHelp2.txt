 Talking in private will help you feel less nervous and more comfortable about asking for help.It will also give your teacher more time to help you because they aren’t trying to teach at the same time.


For example, you could say, “When you have time later today, could we talk about a problem I’m having?”
If you’re afraid to approach your teacher, put a note on their chair. The note could say, “Can we talk later about something personal? Thanks, Mark.”
You could also send your teacher an email or message letting them know you would like to ask their help with a personal issue.
 Sometimes teachers will try to offer advice on what you should do, when all you wanted was for them to listen. If you let your teacher know how they can help, it will make it easier for them to give you the help you want and need.Think about what kind of help you want. Ask yourself, “Do I want her to listen, to give me advice, or to do something about the problem?”
Tell your teacher how they can help. For example, “Can you help me come up with ways to make more friends?”
If you don’t know how you want your teacher to help, you it’s okay for you to say that, too.
Try saying, “I need your help with a problem, but I don’t know what kind of help I need.”

, Also, being honest will help your teacher figure out the right way to help you.


The more truthful information your teacher has about what is going on, the more they will be able to help.
If you are afraid you will get in trouble, then say that. You could say, “I need your help with something but I’m scared I’ll get in trouble.”
If you are asking for help, but also trying not to get someone else in trouble, you could leave out names, but still be honest about what is going on.
For example, “My friend is thinking about cheating on a test and I need advice on how to stop them from doing something so stupid.”

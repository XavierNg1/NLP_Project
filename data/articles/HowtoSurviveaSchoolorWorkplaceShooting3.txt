 You shouldn't jump out of your hiding place and attack the shooter if he's approaching. You should only fight him if you're sure that you'll be shot if you do nothing.
 Trying to engage with the shooter, ask him what he's doing, or to plead for your life by talking about your family has not been proven effective in dealing with shooters. Don't waste your time by trying to talk to him -- you're much better off fighting.
 If you are in a group of people and cannot avoid the shooter, your best chance is to create as much noise and movement as possible. Shouting, throwing objects, and running will buy you a few extra seconds to leave the room, or to attack the shooter if there is no escape route.
 Use scissors, glass, or any other sharp or heavy objects to attack the shooter as soon as you are in close proximity. Even a sharp ballpoint pen is better than nothing. You're fighting for your life and every second counts.


Once again, this is an absolute last resort. Most shooters are heavily armed, and some wear body armor. Even if you have a gun of your own, you are most likely at a disadvantage.
 Try to hurt the shooter in the face, eyes, shoulders, or neck, or arms, so that he's more likely to let go of his weapon. You should stab him in the neck, gouge out his eyes, or stab him in the arm -- doing anything you can to make him get rid of that weapon or to hurt him so the weapon is within your reach.


Kick him in the crotch. If you can't go for his face or weapon, kick him in the crotch. This will be an effective way to disarm him and to cause him a large amount of pain.
 Once you are in this situation, hesitation or panic can be fatal. Be as aggressive as possible, attacking with anything you can. Do not try to run or stop fighting, even if you are shot in the leg or arm.

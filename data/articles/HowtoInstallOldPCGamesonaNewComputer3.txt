 Putting in a disk in during startup could cause your computer to attempt to boot from the CD. Avoid this by waiting until your computer is fully activated.
 The issue with running your game is not the CD itself, but the language in which the program on the CD was written.You will make use of Window's compatibility feature to work around this obstacle.
 Ignore the pop-up installer, selecting cancel to close the window, and instead right clicking the program, choosing "Properties" from the drop down menu.
 If you know the version of Windows that your application runs in, you can check the box labeled "Run this program in compatibility mode for..." and select the version of windows that suits your application. If you are at a loss for which version of Windows to select, you can click to top box under the "Compatibility" tab, which should read "Run compatibility troubleshooter". Follow the troubleshooter prompts to see if another solution is available.

 Take over the counter pain medication to help ease any discomfort. Do not take aspirin, as this can increase your risk of bleeding. Instead, have NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) like Tylenol or Ibuprofen.Always follow the dosage instructions on the label. Do not take more than recommended.
Have pain medication with a meal or food to help your body digest it properly.
 If you are at risk of infection, your doctor may give you antibiotics to take as part of your recovery. Take them according to your doctorâ€™s instructions.You cannot have alcohol when you are on antibiotics.
You may want to take probiotics along with the antibiotics to help your body recover.
 If your pain is severe, your doctor may give you prescription pain medication. This is not usually done unless your tonsillectomy is causing you major pain, or you have other health issues that require prescription pain medication.If the pain is severe and does not go away with pain medication, you should see your doctor for a check up. Extreme pain may be a sign that your tonsillectomy is not healing properly.

 Try some high chairs instead of bar stools – or swap your high chairs for bar stools. You could also get some new seating at your kitchen table. If you’re going for a rustic look, check out your local antiques shop for some plain wooden chairs, or sand down and refinish the chairs you have now. For a minimalist look, paint your chairs white or light gray., If you have bare wooden cabinets, consider sanding them down and painting them. If you have painted cabinets, paint them a different color or strip the paint off them for a natural look. Avoid ripping out your cabinets, as it will be far cheaper to simply refurbish your existing cabinets than to install new ones.Use light colors like white to make your kitchen feel bright and open.
Two-tone cabinets can look great if you choose two complimentary colors, but they will take more work, since you’ll have to first paint the old cabinets or install new cabinets, then paint the trim on them with a second color.
The best cabinets are made of solid wood, not pressboard.
 A backsplash is a series of tiles that climb up the wall between the kitchen counter and the bottom of the cabinets. It typically ends along the vertical line that marks the edge of a window or cabinet, whichever is furthest along the wall of your kitchen. Pick out tiles for a backsplash that matches or compliments your cabinets. Plan the layout of your backsplash carefully, then apply the tile adhesive to your wall and press the tiles into place.Some people choose to place a backsplash only above their sink, rather than all the way around their kitchen.
Brick, ceramic, and handpainted backsplash tiles are available. Choose the one you like best.You can get backsplash tiles at your local home goods store.

 Your leadership exam will require you to state how you would respond to specific problems. For example, determine how you would create a positive culture in a negative environment.
 For example, be ready to answer how you would orient a new teacher in a school or raise the performance levels of a teacher who is struggling.
 In addition to answering multiple choice questions, you will need to write short essays on topics such as development, leadership and education.


Be specific when you practice your essays, but write within the time and word count limit.

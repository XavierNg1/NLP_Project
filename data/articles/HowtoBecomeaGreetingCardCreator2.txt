 Also consider entering greeting card contests.
 Each company will have slightly different requirements, so you will need to tailor your submissions to each one. Include a cover letter.
 Competition in these markets is keen, and you will have to send your ideas out again and again before finding a greeting card company that's interested.
 Keep the style of the artwork and the inscription consistent if you want the same company to buy additional cards.

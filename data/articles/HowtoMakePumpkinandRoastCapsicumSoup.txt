 It's generally easiest to put them over an exposed stove flame with the fan ventilator going to remove any smoke as it is quite pungent. You may also barbecue them or grill / broil them. Turn them regularly with tongs to ensure even charring.;
, Leave for 5 minutes to steam and allow them to cool. This process makes it easier to remove the skins. Wash them under running water or in a bowl of water to remove skins.
 Chop roughly.
 Saut√© the onions until tender. You may brown the onions, but ideally they should not brown too darkly. Caramelised onion adds a sweet nuttiness that can be overpowered by the capsicums / peppers so its more desirable to have the pungency of the onions stand out.


Alternatively, you may add 1 generous teaspoon of curry powder (or more if desired to your tastes), which should be added when frying the onions and cooked until fragrant before the next stage. Ideally do not add the nutmeg as per the later stages, as the flavours don't match well.
 Simmer 25-30 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Puree using a stick blender or a standard blender until smooth and creamy. Season well with nutmeg, salt and pepper and stir in the cream.


You may also add some chopped Swiss chard or kale into the soup at the last minute to just cook the leaves which adds more flavour as well as boosts the nutrient content.
 Good accompaniments are croutons, good crusty bread or garlic bread.

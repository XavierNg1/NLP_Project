To give the lipstick some shimmer, add a little shimmering eyeshadow to the main color you have chosen.
 Place about a tablespoon of petroleum jelly in a microwave-safe bowl. Add a teaspoon of eyeshadow powder. Place the bowl in the microwave and heat it until it melts and becomes runny, then stir it up to distribute the color throughout the jelly.


Add more powder if you want the lipstick to have a more saturated hue (darker/opaque).
Add less powder for a tinted lip-gloss look (lighter/translucent).
Instead of petroleum jelly, you can substitute clear chapstick.
 Use an old lipstick or chapstick tube, a cosmetics pot, or any other container with a lid. Let the mixture harden before you use it.

 There are lots of websites where you can get your item appraised by a professional appraiser. Search for websites which specialize in the kind of item you are trying to sell. Lots of websites are geared toward very specific kinds of antiques or collectibles, from furniture to stamps to vintage toys.


Once you choose your appraiser, you will send them photos and descriptions of your item. Usually within about a week, the appraiser will send back an estimate of your item’s value. , Because online appraisers depend on photos to make their valuations, it’s important that the photos you send are high in quality. Send photos of the item from every angle. Include close-ups of any distinct details in your item. Make sure your photos are well-lit, in color, and not blurry.
Don’t hide any flaws in your item or misrepresent it. Don’t alter your photo to make your item look better than it does in person. Make sure to include photos of any damaged parts of your item, as well. Hiding or omitting flaws may get you a higher valuation for your item, but that value will not carry over when you try to sell it.
 The upside of using an online appraiser is that they are less expensive than in-person appraisers. Online appraisals vary in cost, but you can expect to pay at least $10-30. , Because online appraisers don’t come in contact with your item, their appraisals cannot be as thorough as you’d get from an in-person appraisal. The best way to get an accurate appraisal of the value of your item is to hire an in-person appraiser. It might be useful to get an online appraisal if you’re not sure whether your item is valuable enough to be worth paying an in-person appraiser.

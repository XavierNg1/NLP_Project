 It's only a plastic toy, not a meteor hurtling towards you at the speed of light (it just seems that way). Closing your eyes will only make it more difficult to catch.;
, This is vital unless you have some kind of machine that throws flying disks.
 This is not entirely vital, if you and your partner(s) are careful. Windows, cars and trees are the most common hazards.
, When the Frisbee (or aerobie) is in the air, move side to side with the movement of the disk. Do not go forward...yet.
 It is instinct usually. The basic idea is to close your hands around the disk the right time and not close your eyes. If the disc is an aerobie then the easiest way to catch it is too stick you arm in the large center hole. For Frisbee the easiest way to catch is the alligator method. Take both hands and clamp them around the disc like an alligator.


For a one-handed catch: Keep your thumb pointing up if the disk is coming in below your waist. If the disk is coming in high, keep your thumb pointing down. Use whichever position feels most natural for in-between heights. Squeeze your fingers and thumb tightly together to grab the disk just before it smacks into your palm.
 Run straight. If it rises at the last second, it is easier to stop when going straight than diagonally

, Not hard.

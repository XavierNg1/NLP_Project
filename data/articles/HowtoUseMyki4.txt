 Your myki balance appears on the card reader when you touch off on a bus, tram, or a railway station without barriers. Also consider checking the balance at a top-up machines., These are located at major railway stations and some tram stops. Hold your myki to the blue machine's reader, as though you were touching on. The screen should display some basic information about your myki account, including your balance. When you're finished, press the button to Finish.
 If you've registered your myki, you can check your balance online. Go to the myki login portal at https://www.mymyki.com.au/NTSWebPortal/Login.aspx, then click Login. Navigate to your account balance information.


Note that your online balance will not update immediately after you ride – it may take a matter of hours for the system to catch up. The balance on the actual card—the number that appears when you swipe your card at a touch-off point, top-up point, or balance machine—is always correct.

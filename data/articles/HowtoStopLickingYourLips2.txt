 To try and stop licking your lips, try and put something bad tasting on them. This can include a bad tasting lip balm, petroleum jelly, or even hot sauce. If you have a negative reaction to the taste of licking your own lips, it will incline you to stop. Do not put anything toxic on your lips!

, If you find yourself licking your lips while doing a specific task, try and distract yourself by doing something else. This can include sucking on a piece of hard candy or chewing gum. These tasks are great distractors because they mimic you subconscious habit.
 Wearing cosmetics may help you break a habit of licking your lips as they not only taste bad, but also mess up your appearance. If you are licking you lips in public, not wanting to mess up your makeup may be a good incentive to quit.
 Reward yourself if you find yourself breaking the habit. Set yourself goals such as: “I will not lick my lips from now until lunch time.” Having achievable goals will help you break a habit.

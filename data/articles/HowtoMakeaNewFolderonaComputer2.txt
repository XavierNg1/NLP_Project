 Your Mac's desktop is usually the easiest place to create a folder, but you can create a folder almost anywhere.


You can open Finder, which resembles a blue face at the bottom of the screen, and then go to any place you want to make a new folder, such as Documents.
 This menu item is in the upper-left side of your Mac's screen.
 This creates a new folder in your current location.


You can also right-click on an empty space using a mouse or click using two fingers on a computer with a trackpad. Make sure you don't right-click on a file or folder instead, as this will open the wrong drop-down menu.
 This creates the new folder with its new name.


You cannot use the ":" or "?" characters when naming a folder on a Mac.

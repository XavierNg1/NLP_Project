 A small hoop or a lightweight chain are good options. You can even create your own belly-button jewelry designs using simple materials such as straight pins, beads, wire cutters and pliers.
 If the earring has a hook, either snip it with wire cutters or use needle-nosed pliers to open that link or loop attached to the hook and pull it apart from the rest of the earring., Using a straight pin with a beaded head, slide small beads onto the pin in a custom pattern.Slide the beads over the pin in whatever arrangement you like. Remember, the pin head will be the bottom of the jewelry, so the beads should be small enough they don't slide over it. Don't make the pin arrangement longer than what you'd like dangling from your navel.
Using needle-nosed pliers, bend the remainder of the pin so it forms a 90-degree angle. Clip the sharp end of the pin so that only about 1 centimeter of bare wire remains.
Bend the remaining wire into a small loop using needle-nosed pliers. The loop will be the top of the belly-button ring.
 The best adhesives to use are spirit gum, nail glue, eyelash glue or body glue.You will find it helpful to add glue to both the jewelry and your skin, then stick them together.
 To give the fake belly-button piercing a more realistic appearance, add a jewel about an inch above your navel. If you don't have a sticker, you can use wire cutters to snip off the post from a rhinestone earring (as long as it has a flat back) and glue the jewel to your skin.


While the size of the rhinestone is based on your personal preference, choosing a jewel the same size or smaller than the pin head you chose will look most realistic.
 Be sure you don't move around or touch the pieces for several minutes. It's also helpful to lay down flat while the glue dries.

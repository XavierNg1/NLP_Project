 Do you want a modern style? Is your new apartment or home old style? Does it have a wooden kitchen or a new modern kitchen? Is it wooden decked or carpeted? What is it like?;
, Your place is new and modern? You could start with maybe buying yourself a lounge. Freedom, IKEA, Domain.. Even vinnies! Or auntie Claire's old sofa! Any modern sofa.
 This can be used to store your music & CD'S, your movies .... And you XBOX that you love.
 Of course, that why you have a TV cabinet?!! Any television that you want.
 Or, have your bed from your old home and just get a new bedspread if you like. Pillows add some colour and design to your home & bedroom.
 A kettle, toaster for those mornings, spatulas, forks, knives, pots, pans. Etc.
 You really need a rug in your bedroom & than in your lounge room if you can afford.
 A coffee table is for you & your mates to put your drinks and lift your feet up onto whilst watching a chick flick or a funny comedy movie! Horror even if you're that type of person!

, A draw set in your bedroom! Maybe a mirror above it.
 A bedside table on each side of the bed & 2 lamps on each one, if you can, paint your feature wall (wall bed is up against) a colour that your room will be themed ETC. Blue and red, pink and white, green and orange.... Mostly one colour and white is cool.
 Some soap, your hair supplies.. Don't forget that moisturiser and hair creams. Makeup too! Maybe a toothbrush holder, some new coloured towels, a soap container if you don't like the look of the soap bottle.. ETC.

 Stiff Skin Syndrome is characterized by the development of hard thick skin. This typically develops across the entire surface of the body on young children. The symptoms may begin to show immediately at birth or at some point during the childâ€™s life, usually before the age of six. It typically does not develop after adolescence., The development of hard and thick skin across the body can often be accompanied by limited joint mobility. In some cases the joints may become so stiff that they get stuck in a particular position and are unable to move.For example, an arm may be stuck in a bent position as a result of the stiffening of the elbow joint.
This can also impact posture if the spine becomes bent.

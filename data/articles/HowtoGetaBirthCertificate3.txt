When parents offer up their legal rights to their child, the original birth certificate becomes null and void. If you are seeking the original birth certificate, the adopted child may access this after the age of 18.
 The judge should usher this process on for you.


The forms are typically completed at the same time as the certificate of adoption and honored immediately.
In most cases, an amended birth certificate is issued that states the adoptive parents' names rather than the biological parents' names. This serves as the only legitimate birth certificate; the original is rendered illegitimate., If your child entered the U.S. with an IR-3 visa (and the adoption was completed overseas), re-adoption is not required by Federal courts. In general, adoptions finalized abroad are recognized and legally binding in the U.S. That said, some individual states require you to "re-adopt." Research the area you live to find out what your state's policy is.A re-adoption makes it easier to obtain a U.S. birth certificate for your child. It also ensures that a certificate will be filed with your municipality's vital records department. A legal name change can also be filed simultaneously. Filing a re-adoption allows you to follow the same processes you would to obtain the birth certificate of your biological child.
Once the re-adoption is completed, complete the steps above for obtaining a birth certificate for your child.
 If you were adopted but wish to find a copy of your original birth certificate, check the guidelines for the state in which you were born. Some states allow individuals over 18 to obtain these records. Some states allow for birth parents to have their names redacted from the records, so the records will only be partially available.

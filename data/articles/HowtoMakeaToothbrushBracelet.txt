 The ones with patterns for little kids work great. It's better if they are all plastic, and there is no rubber gripping. It should also be about the same width from the top to bottom. Thicker toothbrushes don't bend as easily.;
, Boil water in the microwave or put a half a pot of water on the stove and turn it on. Make sure that when you boil the water you leave the toothbrush in there for 8-12 minutes. You may need to leave it in for a longer period of time depending on how hot the water is and the thickness of the toothbrush.
 If that is the case stay clear of the water and let it cool down, as it is very hot and may explode if bothered. Put a chopstick or other wooden item in the cup to 'break' the water up. This way it will not 'explode'.
, Drop in the toothbrush. Wait until the plastic starts to soften. This will take more or less time depending on how wide your toothbrush gets at the end, but 5 minutes is a good "base" time to work from.
 Let it cool from boiling hot to warm, but don't let it cool off completely.
 Bend it into the shape of a bracelet. An easy way to do this is to press it around the outside of a glass or jar with the same diameter as you want your bracelet to be.
 Slip off the toothbrush and submerge it. After about 5 seconds, the plastic will be hard again, and you can try it on. If it doesn't fit, or it doesn't look right, put it back into the hot water for a minute, repeat the shaping steps until it turns out the way you want it.

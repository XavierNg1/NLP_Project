 Many people worry about dry, cracked feet. The skin on your feet is easily damaged due to day-to-day walking and one of the simplest ways to manage dry feet is washing them each day with warm water and soap.


Keep the water you use lukewarm. Water that's too hot can dry out skin further.Simply lather a washcloth with hand soap or bath soap and scrub your feet until dirt and dry skin comes off. You should do this each day when you shower., Dry feet can definitely benefit from an exfoliation process. Exfoliating your feet a few times a week can help them stay smooth and clean.


Many beauty stores and drug stores sell exfoliation creams specifically designed for foot care. If you choose this route, simply follow the directions on the package.You can also use epsom salt. Add half a cup of epsom salt to a basin of lukewarm water and soak your feet for 20 minutes. Dry your feet and then add two drops of peppermint oil to your usual moisturizer and rub that into your feet.If your feet are particularly cracked or dry, consider buying a pumice stone or callous shaver. These are loofah-like devices designed to help loosen dead skin from difficult areas like the heels, between the toes, and ankles.
 Another simple way to keep your feet soft is to simply moisturize each day. Simply apply your normal moisturize to your feet after a shower. You may also want to buy a cream specifically designed for feet from a beauty or department store. Pay attention to areas like your heals and between the toes, as these areas tend to dry out most easily.

 If you're a guy walk with your chest out a little bit, not in a ridiculous way, but in a way that makes you look power. Keep your eyes up and your chin up. This is a confident walk and will make you look cool.
 Don’t mix up being cool with being aloof. You can be extremely friendly and mysterious at the same time. You don’t need to constantly reveal things about yourself. Just be friendly to those around you! Smile and wave at people in the hallway. The more that people know you, the more cool people will think you are. If you smile at people, they’ll want to get to know you.
 You're not in the military, relax a little bit. It's considered nerdy to have a perfect posture all the time. Slouch in your desk and put your feet out in front of you. You don't have to do this all the time, but it will help you look nonchalant. If you really want to take it to the next level you can put your hands behind your head too.
 It's always cool to lean up against things - the cool guys do it all the time in movies. If you're talking to a girl or guy in the lunch line try leaning up against the wall with your shoulder while you keep eye contact with them. Super cool.

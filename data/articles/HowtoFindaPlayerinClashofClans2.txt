 Because you're relying on luck to get matched with your friend, you'll have better luck at the higher levels. This is because there are less possible matches at the higher levels, and tons of possible matches at the lower levels. If you're trying to match up against a friendly clan, you may have to wait until you are both high level.There is no way to specifically choose which clan you are going to attack.
 When you're trying to get matched up against your friend's clan, make sure that both clan's Town Hall levels are fairly close to each other.


For example, Clan A may have four Level 10 Town Halls and three Level 9 Town Halls. Clan B may have four Level 10 Town Halls and five Level 9 Town Halls.
You'll have the most success if both clans have the same number of Town Halls at the same levels. Both clans should at least have the same number of the highest-level Town Halls.
 Both clan leaders should try to press the "Start War" button as close to the same time as possible. This will increase the chances that your clans will be matched against each other. You may have to coordinate over the phone or chat app to make sure you press at the same time.
 This process is based on timing and luck, so there's a good chance that it won't work right when you try. You'll just have to try again the next time your clan is ready for war.

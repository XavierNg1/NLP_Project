 Decide what times you will access each wiki during the day. If you contribute to three wikis, for instance, you could use dedicate the first three hours of your day to wikiHow, the next three hours of your day to Wikipedia (with computer breaks in between), and you'd use Wikivoyage for the final three hours of your day.;
, For example, you could contribute to wikiHow for your first half hour of your day, and you could switch to Wikivoyage for your second half hour, and then switch to Wikipedia and contribute there for a half hour. You would then repeat the entire process until you have had enough wiki editing for a day.


Note that it might be easier to use one wiki at a time, instead of constantly switching to other ones for a half hour or so. It depends on your personality, though.
 This method ensures that you make contributions, at least on a weekly basis, to all the wiki communities that you are part of, and that you don't "miss out" on anything. For instance, if you contribute to wikiHow and Wikipedia frequently, you could contribute to wikiHow every other day, and Wikipedia every other day.

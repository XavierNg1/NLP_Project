 When the ball is rolling toward you along the ground, the most important thing is to bend your knees and get your body closer to the ground. You donâ€™t want to simply bend at the waist and reach down. Lowering your body gives you more ability to adjust and it allows you to look around more than if you bend over., Although you usually catch the ball with your fingers up, ground balls require you to flip your mitt so your fingers point down. Rest the top of the mitt on the ground allowing it to act like a ramp that the ball will roll into., This is one of the most important parts of catching ground balls. Your ungloved hand acts as as stop for the ball. Without this placement, the ball could roll straight up your glove and hit you in the face or just be dropped. The bottom part of your hands should be touching each other., As the ball rolls into your mitt, quickly clamp your hand down on the ball and close your glove. If you perfect the rhythm of fielding ground balls, you can learn to let the ball roll up your glove directly into your throwing hand.

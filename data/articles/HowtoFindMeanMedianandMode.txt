 Let's say you're working with the numbers 2, 3, and 4. Add them up: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.;
, In this case, you're working with 3 numbers.
 Now take the sum of the numbers, 9, and divide it by the amount of numbers, 3. 9/3 = 3. The mean, or the average of all the numbers in the set, is 3. Remember that you won't always get a nice even number for your answer.
 Let's say you're working with the following numbers: 4, 2, 8, 1, 15. Just reorder them in ascending order, like so: 1, 2, 4, 8, 15.
 How you do this will depend on whether you have an even amount of numbers or an odd amount. Here's what you can do in either situation:


If odd, cross out the leftmost number, then the rightmost number, and then repeat. When you have one number left, this is your median. If you're working with the numbers 4, 7, 8, 11, and 21, then 8 is your mode because it's the number in the middle.
If even, cross out numbers on either side, but you should have two numbers exactly in the middle. Add them together and divide by two for the median value. (If the two numbers in the middle are the same, that number is your median.) If you're working with the numbers 1, 2, 5, 3, 7, and 10, then your two middle numbers are 5 and 3. Add up 5 and 3 to get 8 and divide this result by 2 to get 4 as your median.
 In this case, you're working with the numbers 2, 4, 5, 5, 4, and 5. It can help to order them from least to greatest here too.
 Think: "Mode is most." In this example, the number 5 occurs the most, so that is the mode. If there are two numbers that occur the most, then that set is "bimodal," and if more than two numbers occur the most, then the set is "multi-modal."

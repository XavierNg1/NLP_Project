 Add 2 tablespoons (28 g) of butter to a large skillet, and heat it on medium. Allow the butter to melt completely, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.The butter will melt more quickly if you cut it into pieces before adding it to the pan.
 When the butter is melted, stir 2 cups (216 g) of shelled walnuts, ½ cup (100 g) of brown sugar, and 2 teaspoons (4 g) of ground cinnamon into the pan. Let the mixture heat on medium until the sugar dissolves, which should take approximately 3 to 4 minutes.Be sure to stir the mixture constantly as you’re waiting for the sugar to melt so it doesn’t burn and the nuts don’t stick together.
 After the brown sugar has dissolved, remove the nuts from the skillet with a spatula or slotted spoon and set them on a silicone baking mat. Let them cool for an hour, so they’re completely cooled and the coating has hardened.If you don’t have a silicone baking mat, you can use a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Store the candied walnuts in an airtight container. They can last for up to two weeks.

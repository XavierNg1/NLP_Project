 If she chooses somewhere else (a closet, the garden), lead her to the whelping box as you do not want to go into labour there.
 When she goes into labour she will pant heavily and start to push but it is only when the first water breaks will she give birth to the first puppy. She will then tear the sack with her tongue and lick up the excess but if you see the puppy is not breathing you can tear the sack from around the nose and mouth until the puppy starts to breathe.
 If she has too many puppies and not enough nipples or one puppy cannot get through, drastic action is needed, You must hand rear and feed this puppy from birth, this needs doing every two hours by a responsible adult.


No children below the age of 12 should hold the puppies before their eyes have opened, as puppies can be fragile. Children, who do not know how to handle them with care, can easily snap the neck of a newborn puppy if they are holding them too tight.
 The mother should stay in the whelping box for 5 days before leaving her puppies for a short while.

 Close the twin handle pieces together to push the point of the can opener into the can lid. Listen for a hissing sound as the cutter pierces the lid and releases pressure from inside the can., Rotate the bar on the outside of the handle to start rolling the serrated wheel around the interior lip of the can lid. As the wheel rolls, it should consistently and evenly slice through the metal. Work your way all the way around the rim of the can lid until it is almost completely severed from the rest of the can.


Generally, the bar rotates clockwise to perform this cut. If you do not see the intended results, try reversing the direction of the bar.
 Use your fingernail or a knife to pry up the severed edge of the lid until you can grip it between your fingers. Carefully pull the lid up and away from the can top. Pour the contents of the can into a bowl or another container â€“ or just eat out of the can! Throughout this process, be very cautious not to cut yourself on the razor-sharp edge of the can or the severed can lid. Pinch the flat top and bottom of the lid, but try not to touch the sides. Watch for tiny shavings of metal while opening that can be harder to notice if they're part of the contents!


Alternately, you can continue to cut until the can lid comes off completely. The lid may sink slightly into the contents of the can, making it somewhat more difficult to remove. Pry it out with a knife or another flat, sturdy object.

 Utility burlap is cheaper than other types of burlap. Even if utility burlap is not the exact color you want, you can decorate it after you purchase it to make an attractive table runner.Decorate your burlap if you want. Acrylic paint and a sponge brush can be used to decorate thick burlap. This works best if you're making a fringe table runner without pom-poms.You can dip a sponge brush in acrylic paint, which you can purchase at any craft store. Use the brush to add designs like circles, stars, hearts, or whatever shape you want. You can add seasonal shapes, like pumpkin shapes for Thanksgiving.;
, If you're not using burlap, figure what length of fabric you want for your table runner. This will depend on the length of your table. Your runner should be slightly longer than the full length of your table. Runners are usually thin strips of fabric, so strive for a rectangle-like shape.You should use a measuring stick to draw the lines of your rectangle to make sure you cut it straight.
Cut a little more fabric than you intend to use, as you'll be fringing the edges slightly.
 To fringe the edges of your table, use your seam ripper. Pull out 2 to 4 threads from the edges of each side of the runner. If you want longer fringes, pull out more threads.Once you've loosened the threads with the seam ripper, use your fingers to pull them away from the fabric.
Usually, threads will break as you pull. You will have to work your way down the thread, using the seam ripper to dislodge the threads and then gently pulling the loose threads out with your fingers.
 Take a pair of sewing scissors. Trim the fringes on every edge of your runner. Trim them only slightly, especially if they're on the shorter side, until all the fringes are of roughly even length.

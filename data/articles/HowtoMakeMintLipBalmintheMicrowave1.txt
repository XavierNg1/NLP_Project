 Place petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline) and your mint extract or oil into a glass dish or jar. Ensure that the container is microwave safe and will allow you to mix the ingredients in it easily.


Use pure peppermint extract or pure peppermint essential oil, or another type of mint like spearmint if you prefer. Add this in a few drops at a time, as you will only need a small amount to scent and flavor the lip balm, and too much can create a burning sensation.Determine the quantity of ingredients to use based on the size of your container or the amount you’re going to make. If you’re only filling one small lip balm pot or tube, you may only need about a tablespoon.;
, Add a little color to your lips while also hydrating them by adding tint to your lip balm. Scrape off the top of a lipstick you don’t use and add it to your petroleum jelly and mint extract or oil.


You can also scrape a small amount of eyeshadow, blush, or another pigmented beauty product into your lip balm to create color.Food coloring or another edible dye will also work to color the lip balm, but note that even one drop will be a very concentrated color if you’re only making a small quantity of lip balm.
 Place your glass container with the petroleum jelly, mint extract/oil, and tint (if using) into a microwave. Heat for about two minutes, or until completely melted, then stir.Microwaves vary, so use your best judgment when heating your ingredients. It may take more or less time to melt the lip balm, but you want it to be fully liquid so it’s easy to pour.
Stir with a wooden chopstick, stir stick, or another utensil that will not melt in the hot liquid and that you can easily dispose of or clean afterwards.
Use oven mitts to remove the container from the microwave, and be very careful with the hot contents. Children should have an adult complete this step.

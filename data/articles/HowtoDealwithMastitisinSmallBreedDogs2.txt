 One of the most recognizable indicators of mastitis is the development of a hard lump under the infected teat that causes it to be swollen and distended. This swelling is accompanied by a red discoloration of the teat. When compared to the dog’s healthy teats, this physical change is very noticeable., Once your dog has developed mastitis, it will begin producing blood and pus through the infected teat. You may notice this discharge by gently squeezing your dog’s teat between your forefinger and thumb. Depending on the severity of the infection, you may also notice that milk comes out with the blood and pus.If the teat only produces blood and pus, it is seriously infected and needs immediate medical attention.
 One of the early indications that something is wrong with your dog is a general loss of appetite. If you notice that your dog is not eating as much as it normally does, it is likely feeling ill. If your dog is nursing, this is problematic because it will quickly become malnourished. If you notice a loss of appetite in your nursing dog, take it to the veterinarian immediately.Although this symptom is not unique to mastitis, it is important that you have your veterinarian check your dog if you notice a loss of appetite.
 Because of the infection, your dog will be listless and less energetic than normal. Your dog may also become increasingly aggressive due to the pain of the infection. If you notice a significant change in your dog’s attitude, take it to the doctor and have it checked out., If you notice a general change in your dog’s behavior, you should check its temperature. If it is running a fever, it may have developed an infection. If your dog has a high temperature, contact your veterinarian.The normal temperature range for a dog is 99.5 to 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 to 39.2 degrees Celsius).

 An essential part of the planning to propose is a date. It has to be a day where she is doing nothing else, and a day where she has nothing to stress about. Find a time and tell her to come; mention that it's important.;
, Whatever it is; a chick flick, a stupid teenager movie, whatever. It could be your least favorite in the world, but it doesn't matter. It's not what you are supposed to focus on.
 Make something homemade and something she loves to eat. Eat before starting the movie so she doesn't get proposed to on an empty stomach.
 Get comfortable! Sit right down next to her and put your arm around her neck. Kiss her before the movie starts, but only a peck. Save the good stuff for later.
 Don't say anything, but laugh when she does and comfort her when she begins to cry.
 Put the movie on pause (optional). Tell her how you feel about her deep down.
 Smile when you say it and look straight into her eyes.
 Kiss her long and hard, showing her how much you love her.
 You just did it! Pat on the back.

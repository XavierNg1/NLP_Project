 First, use orange. No one is quite sure why, but orange buttons boost online sales. Second, use active, specific phrases. For example, if you're selling an online video, don't have your purchase button say, "Complete Sale." Instead, make it say something like, "Gain Instant Access.", You need to make the customer feel like this is their personal page, not a website directed at hundreds of anonymous buyers. A quick switch in language can do wonders for accomplishing this. Instead of writing “Your shopping cart,” write “My shopping cart”. Instead of writing "Your Wish List," write "My Wish List." The more first person writing on your site, the better. You should also personalize recommendations. This will attract the customer to different products and make them feel valued. After they complete a purchase, use words like, "You also might like these products!" and redirect customers to similar products.
 The language and look of your website needs to be the same on every page. Once people see one page they expect the rest of the website to look and sound the same. If your site has an inconsistent design, you risk looking unprofessional. This could deter customers. Also, if a site changes suddenly with a click visitors will have trouble adapting to the new layout. They may feel inclined to leave.

 Hang out with boys as well as girls and try to make friends. In the Sorcerers Stone, she met Ron with a simple "And, you are?" (Ron introduces himself) "pleasure." Watch the video at the bottom to see. If you want new students to know you are smart and quirky, then go up to them after class and with a smile and say, "Hello, (their name), I'm (your first and last name), and I'm here if you need any help with work. I can help you choose the right path to go for learning the work of the world." and hold out your hand to shake theirs. That student can count on you.
 Just stick your chin up in the air, stand straight, and walk away like nothing happened. Hermione would ignore them. To really annoy them if they do this to you often, say, "You used improper grammar when you said shoes, and your posture could go with a little, say, yoga. I can help you there." Walk away a little, "And, you have something on your nose, just to inform you so you don't go walking around like a fool. Good day," and walk off. Let them try to figure out what you said, as this will likely confuse and surprise them.
 Always stick up for them and help them with their work. Never just give them the answers though, Hermione would never do that! Help them like a teacher would, and after, even if the student didn't say thank you, say (in a loud and harsh voice) "You're welcome!" and smile just a little to show that you're joking. They will get the idea.
 Speak maturely and sophisticated and also education. Try to get rid of "like" and other colloquial terms and expand your vocabulary to sound more educated and informed. Don't swear! Hermione is not the type to use profanity, unless of course there is a good reason. But Hermione usually is polite, and will not resort to swearing if she meets a problem. She thinks through problems calm and calculated. Swearing makes you sound uneducated, and if you do it often, you seemÂ immature.

 For a square of side length S, the perimeter is simply four times the side length: P=4s.;
, Depending on the assignment, you may need to measure the side with a ruler, or look at other information on the page to determine the side length. Here are some examples of perimeter calculations:


If your square has a side length of 4, then P = 4 * 4, or 16.
If your square has a side length of 6, its P = 4 * 6, or 24.

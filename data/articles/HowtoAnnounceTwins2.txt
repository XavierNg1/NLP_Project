 The traditional method of announcing births usually comes in the form of mailed cards with birth statistics. You can be creative and include funny captions.


You can send two separate cards in two separate envelopes, two separate cards in the same envelope, or one card with information about both babies together.
 You can begin this once you find out you're expecting twins and include ultrasound photos and shower pictures. Once the babies arrive, you can chronicle their milestones and include updates about their growth.


If you didn't tell everyone you were having twins beforehand, make a big announcement on the website and be sure to link to it from your social media accounts so all your friends will see it.
Some website providers offer free templates to use, or if you're more computer savvy, you can design your own. You may also opt to make your website private and accessible only to those who have a password.
 This is ideal if the children are born around the holidays or specific seasons as you can incorporate that theme into the newsletter. .


If your babies arrive shortly after the New Year, you might state on the newsletter that you rang in the New Year with not just one Baby New Year, but two.
 Your recording can let everyone know that the twins have arrived and can provide answers to common questions people may have.
 This will let all your neighbors know the good news. You can opt for one sign that says, "It's twins!" or, "It's two boys!" or you can post an individual sign for each baby.

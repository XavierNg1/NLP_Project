 Supplements are meant to enhance your diet, not replace them. You will not lose weight if you take supplements but do not change your diet.


In general, you will want to stick to a moderate amount of complex carbs, rather than simple carbs, eat healthy levels of protein, and eat healthy fats, rather than bad fats.
 This may go without saying, but you will not build up muscle if you do not practice some resistance training, no matter how many supplements you take. Work with a trainer to come up with an exercise routine that will work well for you and your goals.
 Many supplements can cause you to become dehydrated, so it is important that you stay hydrated by drinking lots of liquids. Of course, the amount of water you need differs from person to person. However, general guidelines are:


Adult men generally need at least 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water a day.Adult women generally need at least 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of water a day.

 It is important to deal with the ink stain immediately. Blot the spot with a clean cloth or paper towels and apply a little pressure on it. Just blot and don't rub, since rubbing might spread the stain.

Work from the outside going towards the center and try to absorb as much ink as you can.
Change the cloth or paper towels when needed.
If the ink is already dry, it's still worth a try to remove it.
 If the stain is still fresh, warm soapy water can do the trick. Mix 1/2 teaspoon of liquid dish washing soap with a small amount of hot water in a small bowl to make a solution.
 You could also put it in a bottle and shake it up.
, Repeat the applying and wiping process when necessary.
 Make sure to rinse the area thoroughly.
 If the stain remains, repeat the process or try another method.
 This will help prevent future stains and seal some added moisture into the leather to prevent it from cracking over time.

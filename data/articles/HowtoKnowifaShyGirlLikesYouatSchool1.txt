 Eye contact is an important part of human interaction, and it just so happens that when people feel romantically inclined or particularly at ease with someone, a natural physical response is for the pupils to dilate.If she holds your gaze longer than normal, or if you find her staring your way more frequently, this could also be a sign that she's interested in you.Each case will be different, but shy people tend to favor indirect confrontation, so you may never catch her looking your way. If she avoids looking at you entirely, this can be just as strong a sign she's interested. Another sign could be she is looking straight at the clock, whiteboard, or talking to her friends to distract herself but she will look in all directions in the room except avoid looking your way.;
, Some shy girls may become jealous if you flirt with others. She may become irritated with you after you've talked with other girls, or might get hurt when you're not there for her in a more-than-a-friend capacity.Is she bummed out when you miss her volleyball game against the big rivals? She may be hiding a crush for you if this is the case.
 Women often expose their wrists when romantically or physically interested in a man.But even if she's only touching your arm or holding onto you in a crowd, reaching gestures from her to you may mean she looks to you for support on a deeper level.Often it is common for a shy girl to initiate physical contact accidentally, repeating this later as a way of determining whether the touch was welcome or not., She will be more prone to blush around someone she likes.Keep an eye out for reddened cheeks and face; if she's red-faced around you, she could be hiding deeper feelings.
 Some claim that one of the strongest clues you have about another person's interest in you is the distance that person stands from you.The closer a person stands, the more likely that person would consider you as a romantic partner. Also, the direction her feet point might point out whether she's digging you or looking to dash out the door., If she dresses up in special clothes when you hang out, or if she adds a special touch, like makeup, this could mean that she's dressing up to impress you.When you catch her looking in the mirror and straightening her bangs, her preening to look good for you is a strong indication she might have a crush on you.
 If you find her frequently leaning in close when you are speaking and tilting her head while you speak, this is a strong indication of engagement and interest.The more frequently you see this behavior, the more likely she is interested in you as more than a friend.

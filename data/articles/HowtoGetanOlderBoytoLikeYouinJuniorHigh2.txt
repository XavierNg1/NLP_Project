 If so, he may be attracted towards you. Does he stare at you often? Does he look genuinely happy when he's around you? These MAY be signs that he likes you.



Always face him
Stare at him and if he catches you, sweep your eyes up and down his body a few times then smile at him slyly. This will show him you're definitely interested.
Flaunt your body once in a while.
Smile when he comes near you.


When he comes into the room, onto the bus, into the library, ect., say a simple greeting to him. If he responds enthusiastically, then he likes you. If he responds awkwardly, then maybe you should find another boy....






Say Goodbye to him when he leaves, this will give him a chance to remember you.






Talk to him when you have the chance, comment about the weather, his clothing, school, ect.






Compliment him! Every guy loves to be complimented, say how great he looks in his jacket, or that black looks wonderful on him. Maybe say that you love his new hair cut or his new shoes. Don't compliment him too often though, or else he may not treasure your compliments. Do it once in a while so that he finds it very precious and special.






Sometimes, he may express his feelings about other girls to you. He may say something like "That girl really likes me and I just... don't really like her." Or "That girl is really pretty." This could be good or bad, it could mean he sees you as a good friend who's like 'one of the guys' and probably doesn't look at you romantically, or it could mean he wants you to get to know him and he wants to get to know you, and is not afraid to open up to you.

If he points out that he doesn't like a girl who likes him, it COULD be a way of showing that he is not interested in other girls, but he is in you. Don't get TOO excited when he talks about other girls to you, because it could be a sign you are stuck in the friend zone.

 Many restaurants allow you to book a reservation directly on their website. When doing this, you may also be able to see a list of all available dates and times for either the upcoming week or month. The restaurant is likely to require you to create a login or provide an email address or phone number so they can confirm your reservations. However, they should not text or email you anything else outside of updates on your reservation.
 If you are unable to book a reservation directly on the restaurant’s website, you can try an online booking site like OpenTable or Reservation Genie. These sites will allow you to search restaurants based on your preference of time, date, cuisine, and price range. There are also applications you can put on your phone like NoWait, which allows you to put your name in before heading to the restaurant. An app like this is great for last minute reservations., Once you’ve made your reservations online, you should receive a confirmation either by email or via text. Some of these sites or restaurants may require you to click a link or a button to confirm your reservation. You may also be sent a link to cancel or change your reservation if you need to.


Many of these online booking sites also offer coupons or have membership rewards programs through which you can accumulate perks.
If you can’t cancel online, you may have to call the restaurant directly.

 Videos which are already available can easily be dragged and dropped into the content repository.


A message will pop up to indicate the conversion and import status. A green indicator shows that import and conversion were successful.
Once a lecture video is in MSML format, secondary content can be embedded.
 The Media Lecture Assembler is used to embed content. It can be opened by double-clicking any ML file. The Assembler has two sections: the pane where the video is played, and the section used to embed secondary content.


Select contents to embed from the content and questions repository located on the right-hand pane at any time.

Any content with "READY" and "RELEASE" status can be embedded into this content pane.
Any secondary content with "DRAFT" or "HOLD" status has to be reset to "READY" or "RELEASE" before embedding. Not doing this will affect packaging, checking in, and publishing of the course.


Add additional secondary content.

By default, one secondary content pane is open already. If needed, new secondary content tabs can be added by pressing the "PLUS" symbol on the video pane control bar.
A new secondary content tab can not be added until the previous content tab is populated with at least one secondary content element (an image or text or video).

 In Venezuela, arepas are often filled with ham and cheese for breakfast.Choose deviled ham salad or smoked ham and pair it with cheese like Guayanes, Paisa, or Duro.


If you can't find one of the traditional Venezuelan cheese varieties, you can substitute queso fresco or mozzarella.
For a less traditional but equally delicious breakfast filling, try scrambled eggs and salsa.
 Arepas are often eaten plain, or with a simple filling of cheese as a snack. For a heartier snack, make one of these simple arepa fillings:


Chicken salad and avocado. Combine chopped chicken meat, mayonnaise, diced onions, and diced celery with salt and pepper to taste. Spread it over one half of the arepa and add a few slices of avocado, then top with the other arepa half.
Black beans and salsa. Spread black bean paste or whole black beans on one side of the arepa, and top with spicy salsa. You can also add a few slices of cheese to make the arepa richer.
 After arepas, de Pabellón is Venezuela's most treasured dish. The combination of the two is exquisite. A de Pabellón arepa consists of the following ingredients:


Pulled or shredded beef, black beans, and fried plantains. This is the most classic version.
Top the beef, beans and plantains with a fried egg and cheese to take it over the top.

 It would be a good idea to straighten your hair, even if it is naturally curly. This will help prevent frizz.
 This will give you a more manageable amount of hair to work with, while keeping the extra hair out of the way.
 The smaller sections you work with, the more crimped your hair will be.
 This will keep your hair from getting damaged.
 Try to get as close to the roots as possible. Use a medium heat setting. Any hair straightener will do, but the wider the straightener is, the looser your crimp will be. If you want sharper crimps, look for something that is ½ or 1 inch (1.27 or 2.54 centimeters) wide.
 Flip the straightener upwards by 180°. Gently tug downward on the loose ends of the hair section. This will create a curve.
 Clamp it down.
 Flip the straightener downwards by 180°. Meanwhile, gently tug on the loose ends of the hair section upwards. This will complete the crimp.
 Rotate the straightener upwards while gently tugging down on the loose ends of your hair—just as before. Keep going down the length of the hair section, rotating the straightener up and down, until you reach the ends.









Be careful not to tug downwards with the hand that is holding onto the straightener.
 Remember to spray each section down with a heat protection spray before you touch it with the hair straightener. Also, if you divided your hair into two parts, let your already-crimped hair cool down a little before undoing the bun and crimping the rest of your hair.
 If you touch it too soon, you may mess up the crimps before they set. , This will help set the crimps and make them last longer.

 Particularly if your school allows more leeway with hair or makeup, this can be one of your best tickets to personalization.
 If you’re a trendsetter, set some trends.


You can get inspiration from different resources like How to Have Fun Experimenting with Makeup, Pinterest (for example, take a look at this board), Tumblr (like this search page), or makeup blogs (like FunnyFaceBeauty or SlashedBeauty).
Experimenting is encouraged, even recommended, but do also brace yourself for some sideways glances if you decide to seriously push some boundaries.
 You can push your look even further with an interesting haircut, which you can then experiment and play around with.


For new haircut ideas, check out places like Pinterest (for example here or here), Tumblr (here, for example, or here), or blogs like DailyMakeover or BeautyRiot.
 Go from a messy bun one day to a slicked-back look the next, or from a sleek ponytail to beachy waves. Your options are only limited by your imagination (and possibly your school’s dress code—again, read it!).


Look around for styling options and inspiration from places like Buzzfeed (here, for example), YouTube channels (like Alyssa Forever), or blogs like HairRomance or TheSmallThings.
 Dying your hair a flattering or eye-catching color can seriously enhance your look. But do your research first, whether you plan to dye it yourself or to go to a salon.


Dye with extreme caution if you plan to do it yourself. Dying hair is a tricky business and you can not only end up with a color you don’t want, you can also seriously damage your hair in the process.So do your research and get help—you’re going to need at least one extra set of hands. If you decide to go the DIY route, check out How to Dye Your Own Hair.
If you’re going for a drastically different color than your natural one, definitely go to a reputable stylist to have it done.
 If you aren’t quite ready (or allowed) to take big risks with your hair or makeup, get playful with your nail polish. You can play with bright and unusual colors and color combinations as well as with new and eye-catching designs.

 Take a measuring cup and dump enough water in your machine’s water basin so it reaches the point of “max fill.” Make sure to use only cool, clean water. If you want, you can use filtered or distilled water. This will reduce buildup of minerals and make your machine work longer and better.
 To maintain freshness, coffee pods are usually wrapped individually. Make sure to remove the pod from its packaging without damaging it. To do this, rip along the perforated line of the coffee pod’s packaging to remove it without damaging the pod.
 Pop open the pod holder part of your machine. Depending on your machine, you may need to press a button to open it. Then, gently place the pod in the machine. The pod should easily slide into the pod holder. Once it is in, close the pod holder.
 Depending on what strength you want your coffee, you’ll need to set your machine. Your machine should have a light, medium, or strong setting. If it doesn’t, it might have a setting for the amount of water you want to fill your mug with. The more water, the weaker the cup of coffee.

If you don’t adjust your settings, your machine will likely brew you a medium cup of coffee., After adjusting your settings, hit the “Brew” or “Start” button on your pod machine. Once you start the machine, it will release hot water into the coffee pod and then the water will be released into your mug.Enjoy your cup of coffee after the stream of water has ceased.

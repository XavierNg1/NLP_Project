 Place all the files you want to include in the JAR file inside a single folder. They will need to be referenced through a single command line, so specifying separate paths is not feasible.;
, This can be done by clicking on Start and then Run. Type "cmd" into the text box and click the "OK" button.
 By default, the command prompt will read "C:\>."


To navigate deeper into the hard drive, use the "change directory" command by typing "cd."
For example, if your files are stored at "C:\myfiles," then you should type "cd \myfiles."
To go directly to the directory, hold down shift and right click on the folder in explorer. Then select "Open command window here".
 You will need to run the jar.exe utility to create a JAR file, and that file is located in the bin directory.


Use the "path" command to specify the JDK bin directory. For example, if you installed JDK to the default location, you would type: "path c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_09\bin"
If you aren't sure of the exact directory, navigate to it in Windows Explorer and take note of the directory's full path.
 The format of the command line for creating the JAR file looks like this: "jar cf 'jar-file'.jar input-file(s)."


The "jar" portion refers to the jar.exe program, which compiles the JAR file.
The "c" option specifies that you want to create a JAR file
The "f" option means that you want to specify the filename.
The "jar-file" portion is where you should type the name that you want the file to have.
"Input-file(s)" is a space-separated list of all the files to be included in the JAR file.
For example, you might type "jar cf myjar manifest.txt myclass.class." This would create a JAR file with the filename "myjar.jar" which would include the files "manifest.txt" and "myclass.class."
If you add directories to the JAR file, the jar.exe utility will automatically add their contents.

 Use a sharp knife to chop off the bottom 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) of the leek, cutting away the stringy root.









You should also peel away any outer layers that look stained or wilted. While you will not be using the dark green portion of the leaves, some of the leaves may extend down to the usable light green portion. For that reason, it is important to peel away leaves that look rotted or especially dirty.;
, Make a cut down the center of the stem, beginning from the the top of the light green section and working all the way through the bottom. Cut completely through the stalk.









Stop the cut just below the dark green leaf section. The dark green portion of the leek has a bitter taste and a tough, unpleasant texture, so it is not generally used for cooking.
 Rotate the leek 90 degrees so that the slice you just made runs from side to side. Make another cut down the center of the stalk, the same length as the first, separating the stalk into quarters.









To create larger pieces of leek, skip this step, leaving the leek sliced in half rather than in quarters.
 Make short, 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) cuts across the width of the leek. Work from the bottom up, stopping once more at the dark green portion of the leek.









These cuts should completely release the sliced portions from the rest of the stalk.
The resulting pieces should look like small crescent moons.
 Use your fingers to gently separate the rings apart. This can usually be accomplished simply by tossing the pieces around a bit.

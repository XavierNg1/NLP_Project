 Protein powder can be extracted from a variety of foods, including dairy products, egg whites, and vegan alternatives. This is why different brands of protein powder can have such significantly different flavors. Before spending your money on a powder that might turn your stomach, spend some time surfing the web for information. Many health, exercise, and bodybuilding forums have threads where users discuss their favorite and least favorite protein powders.
 If you're on the hunt for a better tasting powder, don't invest in a giant tub of it. Buy the smallest container you can find. If you don't like it, you can either discard it or power through until you run out â€” hopefully quickly!

, The problem may be that you can't stand the taste of unflavored protein powder. Luckily, many brands sell products that are already flavored with chocolate, vanilla, and cinnamon. You can even find wilder flavors like cookies and cream!If these flavors don't work for you on their own, try mixing them together. Half a scoop of cinnamon with half a scoop of chocolate may be your new favorite flavor.
 Protein powders are marketed to health-conscious people, so most of them don't have sugar or corn syrup in them. In fact, they often advertise that they have no added flavors or sweeteners. Sugar always helps mask the taste of the powder, though, no matter what you mix it with. Look for the few brands that do include some kind of sweetening agent.Keep in mind that added sugar should be limited throughout the day and will add extra calories to your protein powder.

 It doesn't matter if you're nervous and don't feel like eating, but you have to get something in you. Pasta is a good choice because it's jam-packed with good carbs that give you lots of energy.
 Make sure you wet your hair, shampoo, rinse, condition, rinse, get your entire body wet, wash your entire body, and then rinse it all of.
 After you dry off and semi-dry your hair, slip into your outfit. Pull it up from your feet if you can. That way your wet hair doesn't make your dress wet too.
 If you are going to be using any type of hair product, throw an old, large pajama top over yourself. To add more volume, flip your hair over and completely dry your roots first. Then fling your head back like those models in the hair product commercials, then finish drying and styling.
 Don't add another 2 inches (5.1Â cm) to your face.
 Relax, do some yoga eye exercises, and take deep breaths. Carry yourself well like you know what you're doing, and just remember you're here to have fun. Don't freak out over boys, or obsess over how beautiful you and all your friends look. Just have fun.

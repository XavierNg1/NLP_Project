, If you have a website or blog, or even a Facebook and/or Myspace, be sure to note that you can be contacted at your email. You'll get lots of emails by this method, particularly Facebook, since it's insanely popular.
 If your pals have websites, Facebooks, et cetera, ask them to give you a shout out! Ask them to tell some of their friends about you and give them your email.
 You won't get more emails if you don't check your email. Never responding generally doesn't make people want to talk to you more!

, For example, let's say you know Person A. Person A has your number, does Person A have your email? See if you can get your email to everyone in your phone contacts!

, Once again, Facebook! Myspace! Whatever it may be, even Twitter! Give your friends your email, tweet your email, whatever you feel must be done.

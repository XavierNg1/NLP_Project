, Use a vegetable brush to scrub the potato skins thoroughly to remove any dirt. Since you won't be peeling the potatoes, it's important to get the jackets clean.
 If you want the jackets to have a crispy skin, make sure the potatoes are completely dry before baking.
 Make 8 to 12 holes all over the potatoes. This will allow moisture to escape during the cooking process.
 Rub the jackets with olive oil and sprinkle them with salt. This will bring out the flavor of the skins. You can skip this step if you don't like to eat the jackets., Place the potatoes directly on the center rack of the oven and let them bake for about 1 3/4 hours to 2 hours, depending on the size. The potatoes are ready when the skin is crispy and the interiors are soft when poked with a fork.


You may want to place a baking sheet under the potatoes on your oven's lower rack to catch any drippings.
If you prefer soft jackets, wrap the potatoes in aluminum foil and poke holes in the foil before placing them on the rack to start baking.
 Slit each potato in half lengthways. Use a fork to fluff the insides. Add your favorite toppings, like a generous knob of butter, a scoop of sour cream, and a sprinkle of chives. Serve immediately.


Jacket potatoes are excellent as a side dish or an entire meal. To make your potatoes into a meal, top with chili (either meat or vegetarian) or roasted vegetables.
For a delicious twist, try jacket potatoes with smoked salmon, cream cheese and capers.

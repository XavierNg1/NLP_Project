: Pick up the knee of the kicking leg directly in front of you above waist level. The higher your target, the higher you should raise your knee. Fold your knee tightly. Point your kicking foot and toes downward. Turn the hip over by turning the toes of the supporting foot away from the target. (Do not allow the kicking knee to dip or point downward) At this point the shin and thigh of your kicking leg should be parallel to the floor. Point the chambered knee past your target so that your kick will penetrate past the targetâ€™s surface.;
,: Deliver the kick by unfolding the leg at the knee, rotating through the target and snapping the hips over at the moment of impact. The target should be struck at ninety-degree angle before your leg reaches full extension and the kick should be allowed to continue and penetrate several inches past the surface before returning.
: Retract the leg as quickly as possible by bending the knee tightly. The less time the foot is in contact with the target the more "shock" will be transferred to the target, the longer you foot is contact with the target the more pushing power will be transferred to the target. At this point the leg can return to the chambering position in preparation for a second kick or returned to the floor.

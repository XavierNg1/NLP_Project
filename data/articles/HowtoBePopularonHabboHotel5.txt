 You don't have to shell out $15 on credits to get furni. Play games like Falling Furni, mazes, and other things. Look in descriptions or titles to see if there is a prize rewarded, then play to win. You can also win coins to buy HC and furni.
 You could have gained a lot of popularity, but when someone sees a starter lamp, they'll be turned off.
 If you're not allowed to, play games like falling furni or cozzie change. You may or may not win, but you still have plenty of fun playing anyway!

 Grime and dirt is sometimes the only thing holding a stone in place, especially if it is an older piece of jewelry. Use care when scrubbing and always polish while holding directly over a towel, never over a sink or floor. If a piece of the jewelry is loose, take it to a jeweler to be fixed before cleaning it on your own.
 Pour one cup of warm water and ¼ cup of ammonia into a bowl. Do not put the diamonds in the mixture directly. Instead, take a soft toothbrush toothbrush and dip it into the mixture., To clean other gemstones, like rubies and sapphires, use two cups of water and a few drops of dish soap or detergent. Put the jewelry into the mixture. Allow the jewelry to soak for twenty minutes before removing.You can also use baby shampoo in place of soap or detergent.
 Begin gently scrubbing the diamonds with the toothbrush that has been dipped into the mixture. Along with cleaning the main parts of the jewelry, make sure to to get into the small areas and setting as well. If you are cleaning diamonds with a platinum setting, this mixture with ammonia will clean the setting as well as the diamonds.Use a soft toothbrush that will not be used again for any other purpose outside of cleaning.
 Rinse the jewelry under or in warm water when you have finished scrubbing. If you’re cleaning multiple pieces of jewelry, rinse each piece individually. Then, lay the diamonds or gemstones on a tissue to dry. Store them in a safe place once they have finished drying.
 If the jewelry doesn’t come out as polished as you’d like it be, you can purchase a commercial jewelry cleaner. A cleaner can be purchased online or at a jewelry store. Make sure to ask a jeweler if your jewelry can withstand a commercial cleaner before using it.The directions for using a commercial jewelry cleaner depends on the type of cleaner you have. Read the instructions carefully before use.

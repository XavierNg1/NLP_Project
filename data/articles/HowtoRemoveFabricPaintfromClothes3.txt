 If you got paint on the bottoms of your pants legs or sleeves, you may be able to modify your clothing slightly to get rid of the stained area. Simply raise the hem to convert your long pants to capris or your long-sleeved shirt to a Â¾-sleeved shirt.


You can hem your own clothing if you know how to sew, or you can take it to a tailor to have it professionally done.
 Fabric paint is meant to be applied to fabric, so one way to save your garment is to simply apply more paint. Create a fun design on your clothing that incorporates the stain. No one will ever know that you didn't intend to get paint on your clothes.Don't try to cover up the paint stain with a new paint color that matches the fabric. This may not come out well.
 If you don't want to apply more paint to the fabric, think about other ways you could cover it up. For example, you could attach a decorative patch or even cover the area with sequins.If you don't like to sew, you can find iron-on patches for clothing.
 If you can't think of any way to salvage your garment, but you really like the fabric, you may be able to make something else out of it. For example, if you got paint on your favorite blouse, try making a throw pillow out of the unstained portion of the fabric. You may also be able to cut a large shirt with a paint stain into smaller pieces to make a child's shirt.


This will require sewing skills. You can find patterns for making clothes online. If you don't know how to sew, find a tailor who will make custom clothing with your fabric.

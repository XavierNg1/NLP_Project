 Fill it with water far enough so it provides water for the plant or flower but not so high that it spills out through the hole. Repeat with remaining vases if you're using more than one.
 Hang the vase back on the wall. Adjust the flower positioning once the vase is hanging on the wall, for design and aesthetics purposes.

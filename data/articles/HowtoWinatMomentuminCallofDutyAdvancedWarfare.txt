 Under Standard Playlists, go to Momentum.;
, Wait for the countdown to end.
 Move towards that general area.
 If it's a one-way entry area from both sides, you can risk it. If it's out in the open, scour the map of the nearby area for enemies.
 Make sure you can get inside, tuck yourself into a good hiding place, and wait it out.
 Not all at once, mind you. Keep your team coordinated, and have players go in one at a time, the next player ready to defend the zone if the previous player gets killed.
 Immediately move on to the next. The game is over once one team captures two out of three zones.

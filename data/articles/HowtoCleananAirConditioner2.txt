 Turn off the 240-volt power to the air conditioner at the shutoff box on the exterior of your house.


You will either have to pull out the shutoff, pull down a handle or remove the fuse. If you don't see a shutoff box, then turn off the circuit breaker that powers the A/C.
 Use a vacuum with a soft bristle-brush attachment. You may have to unscrew a protective metal case to access the fins.


Check for grass, weeds, leaves and other debris that may block airflow. Trim any foliage to leave about 2 feet (61 cm) of space around the outdoor unit.
Be careful not to damage the fins as you vacuum. They can bend easily. If necessary, straighten your fins with a dinner knife or a fin comb.
 The fan usually lifts out with the grille, so support the fan carefully as you lift so that you don't damage the electrical connections.


Wipe the fan clean with a damp cloth.
 Most fans won't, but if yours do, then apply 5 drops of oil made specifically for electric motors. Avoid penetrating or all-purpose oil (such as WD-40).
 Using moderate water pressure, spray the fins from the inside out.
 Return the fan and grille to their original positions and screw them back to the unit.
 Go inside your house and turn your indoor thermostat from "Cool" to "Off."

, Allow your A/C to sit idle for 24 hours.
 Switch the thermostat back to "Cool" and set the temperature of the unit so that it kicks on. Wait 10 minutes.
 Pull back the insulation on the pipes that come out of the base of the air compressor. One pipe should feel cold, while the other should feel warm. If the temperatures of these pipes are off, then you need your coolant levels adjusted by a professional.

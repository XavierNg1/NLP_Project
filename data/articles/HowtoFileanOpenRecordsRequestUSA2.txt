 Each state has open records laws and sunshine laws that require certain government meetings and sessions be open to the public. Before you send a request, you want to make sure that the information you want is something your state makes available to the public.


The RCFP has collected all state open records laws. You can browse each state, or select several states to compare a particular point across multiple state laws.
The state law specifies what information the government makes available and details the procedure for requesting that information.
 Each state’s law will detail what information should be included in the request and how the records should be described.


You can also use the Student Press Law Center’s Public Records Letter Generator, which generates a letter to meet the requirements of each state’s open records law.
 Depending on the state and the scope of your request, you may have to pay a fee for your request to be processed.


If you’re using the SPLC’s letter generator, you can specify a maximum fee amount you’re willing to pay. If the fee runs beyond that amount, the agency will contact you beforehand.The SPLC letter is designed for use by student media organizations, but there’s no reason the form can’t be augmented for use by anyone.
 Statutory deadlines vary in each state, but usually require and agency response within 10 to 20 business days.


For example, in Illinois the agency receiving the request must respond within five business days, although that time can be extended for an additional five days if the request is extensive, the records are housed in another location, or for other specific reasons.
In contrast, the Texas statute only requires records to be produced “promptly” in response to a request, but doesn’t specify a deadline.

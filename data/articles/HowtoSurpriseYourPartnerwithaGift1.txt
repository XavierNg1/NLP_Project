 Write a surprise message for your partner. Put it in their wallet or purse, so they are surprised to find a lovely message. You could also mail a message on a cute postcard. In the message, you can tell them how much you love them and give them directions for how to find their surprise gift., One of the biggest obstacles to surprise and intimacy is a lack of time. Take the kids to the park early in the morning and leave your partner in bed so that they have time to sleep in. Get a babysitter for a day and spend it with your partner doing things you love doing together. At the end of the day, give them their surprise gift., If you have been together for a long time, it can be hard to determine a surprise gift that your partner will actually enjoy. If this is the case, you could try asking one of their close friends, as long as you trust them not to tell your partner about it. You could also ask a family member if they have heard anything about what they might want., If you have a shared bank account, use your own credit card or cash to make the purchase so that your partner will be less likely to figure out the surprise.
 Secretly pack a picnic. When your partner gets home from work at lunch or dinner, tell them you are taking them someplace special. Take them someplace that has meaning in your relationship such as a favorite park or historical monument or lookout. Put your surprise gift at the bottom of your picnic basket.

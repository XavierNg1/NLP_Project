 Drawing your ideal man is a lot easier than finding him, but searching in the right places will put you on the right track. Odds are there are eligible bachelors hanging out in the same places you like to hang out.


Look at the list of desired personality traits you created and identify the hobbies you want your partner to share. For example, if you're an athletic person and you want your man to go on ten-mile runs with you every weekend, spend some extra time scouting at your gym or even your local sporting goods store.
If it's sharing beliefs that is most important to you, look for potential partners in specific communities such as religious/spiritual groups or at political meetings.
 Being set up with someone seems daunting to most, but sometimes your friends really do know what's best for you.


Talk to your friends and let them know what you're looking for. Chances are they just might know someone that fits your description.






Don't feel obligated to say "yes" if your friends want to set you up with someone you're really not interested in dating, even if you asked for their help.
 While it can seem creepy to people who grew up without the internet involved in every aspect of their life, internet dating has become a common place to find potential mates.


Set up a profile on a dating website such as match.com or eHarmony.com and browse around to see if you find any guys that share your interests. It might not be the old-fashioned way of doing things, but it does allow you to clearly articulate what you're looking for in a guy.
Hire a matchmaker to set you up. If you're really having trouble finding Mr. Right and have the funds, hire a love professional to find potential matches for you. After all, a matchmaker has a very specific job, and s/he might just find something that you're missing.

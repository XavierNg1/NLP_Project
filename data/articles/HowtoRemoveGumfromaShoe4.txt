 Apply a thick layer of creamy peanut butter (approximately two tablespoons) to the gum, then leave it to sit for 10 minutes.
 After 10 minutes, use a wire brush to scrub away both the peanut butter and the gum. It may take a little elbow grease, but the gum should come away too.









Remember to scrub with the grooves of the sole instead of against them, to avoid damaging your shoe., Hold the sole of your shoe underneath some cold running water and scrub with a sponge to remove any peanut butter residue.

 Hold the marrow very firmly as you do so. Take a tablespoon and carefully take out the marrow watery seeds. They are a bit like cucumber seeds, but be careful not to dig into the marrow vegetable flesh too deeply with the metal spoon, as you need the marrow vegetable flesh to eat.
 Once all of the marrow seeds are removed, place the 2 marrow halves on a baking tray and bake 200 °C (392 °F) for 35 mins in a preheated oven. Let the baby marrow cook in its own juices as the marrow is roasting.

You can eat the skin of the marrow as long as its a baby marrow. Baby marrow's skin tastes sweet.
Older marrows skin is bitter. It is best for older marrow skin too be peeled and removed.
 You can make a tasty filling by placing creamy mashed potato on top of filling with 1/4 of grated cheese and 1/4 of fine bread crumbs for extra crunch.

Always taste a little during cooking for seasoning.
 After about 35 mins of the marrow baking, take it out of the oven and fill the 2 marrow halves with the filling of your choosing., Serve with mixed salad and sliced and buttered garlic bread, on a bed of mixed vegetable or spiced cooked rice.

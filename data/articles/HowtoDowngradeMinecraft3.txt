 These programs contain all of the files for every version of Minecraft, allowing you to choose which one you want to play. Make sure that you download trusted version changers only, as they may include viruses and other nasty programs. Popular programs include:


Minecraft Version Changer
MCNostalgia

, This prevents any loss in saves or data in your current game in case they are not compatible with your downgraded version. To do this:


Create a new folder on your desktop. Name it “Minecraft Backup” or something similar.
In your search bar or explorer window, type in %AppData%. Press Enter. In your AppData folder, open your Roaming folder. Inside, you'll find a folder named minecraft. This folder contains all of your Minecraft program files.
Copy the entire “.minecraft” folder to your new backup folder. Be sure to leave the original in the original location as well.
 While each version changer will look a little different, they all do essentially the same thing. The program should detect the location of your Minecraft installation automatically, and then offer a list of versions to change to. This list goes all the way back to early alpha (a) and beta (b) versions.
 Select the version you want to play from the list. The correct files will be downloaded and installed automatically. Once the process is complete, close the version changer program.
 After being patched, you can log in and play Minecraft just as you normally would. You will not be able to connect to servers that aren’t running your version, but you can play single player or on servers that are running your version. Mods may be incompatible.

 Road signs are color-coded to help drivers quickly identify their meaning. When you are colorblind, you may not be able to distinguish these colors. As such, you should spend a bit of time studying common road sign shapes and symbols. This way, you will be able to efficiently understand the meanings of various road signs while you are driving.Some common road signs include:

Stop sign = an octagonal sign with the word "STOP" in large letters.
Road condition warning signs = diamond shaped signs with black symbols. For example, a curvy arrow indicates that a winding road is ahead, and a cross means that a cross-roads is ahead.
Construction signs (also called temporary traffic control signs) = diamond shaped signs, either depicting a construction worker holding a flag, or with printed text (such as "RIGHT SHOULDER CLOSED."

, If certain colors (like orange/yellow) do not stand out to you, you must be extra careful in construction zones. You may not be as likely to notice cones, construction tape, or even workers. Take notice of construction zones and slow down., When you are colorblind, you may not react as quickly to road signs and other markers. As such, you should get into the habit of driving a bit slower, and being more careful. This is particularly true if you are experiencing any additional road hazards.Such hazards may include:

Driving at night
Driving during snow or rain
Driving on winding or steep roads
Wildlife on the road

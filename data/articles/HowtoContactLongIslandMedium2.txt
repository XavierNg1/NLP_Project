 One of the simplest ways to write fan mail to Long Island Medium is by sending a letter through the mail.


The address used for fan mail is the same one listed for any other form of contact: Theresa Caputo, PO Box 490, Hicksville, NY 11802.
Include as much or as little information as you'd like. Fan mail does not always receive a reply, but if you include a return address or e-mail address, you might get an acknowledgment that your letter was received. It is also a good idea to include your first and last name.
 Even though the contact form on her website is designed for those interested in requesting a reading, you can use the form to send simple fan mail, as well. Simply skip over the portion that asks you to specify if you are interested in a group or private reading.


The form can be found at: http://www.theresacaputo.com/contact/

When writing your message, it might be a good idea to indicate that you are not requesting a reading and only sending fan mail at some point in the body of the message.
Include as much or as little contact information as you wish. Specifying an e-mail address will allow Theresa Caputo or the website administrator to let you know that your message was received, but doing so does not guarantee a reply. Including your first and last name is also a good idea. All other fields can be left blank if desired, however.

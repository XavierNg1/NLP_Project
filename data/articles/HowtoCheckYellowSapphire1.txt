 Most fake sapphires are made from glass. While yellow glass may look similar to yellow sapphire at a glance, the two are drastically different when compared with one another. In general, yellow glass is too big and too colorful to be real.;
, Sapphires can have several interior inclusions, but yellow sapphires of high quality will not have inclusions that are visible to the naked eye. Fake sapphires, on the other hand, often have tiny bubbles inside.
 Sapphire of any color is extremely hard. Diamond is the hardest gemstone, ranking a 10 on the Moh's scale of mineral hardness, and sapphire ranks at 9.0 on the same scale. As such, very few materials can scratch a sapphire. Glass, on the other hand, ranks between 5.5 and 6.0 and is scratched much more easily. A glass imitation of yellow sapphire often has lots of surface scratches, while real sapphire has very few, if any.
 Since glass is not as hard as sapphire, it is cut much more easily. Yellow glass stones are cut quite simply and usually have smooth, rounded edges. On the other hand, yellow sapphires have more complex cuts that are sharp and crisp.

 Some are nice, some are not. Some are happy and successful, some are not. Never assume anything about a person because of their religion, spirituality, or lack thereof.;
, Do not force your spouse to attend with you, if he/she does not wish to. That is disrespectful to their views, and may cause your spouse to harbor resentment.
 If you wish to raise them as Christians, make that clear with your spouse. In fact, this should be done with any interfaith couples, be they Christian/Atheist, Christian/Jewish, Muslim/Jewish, Muslim/Atheist, Christian/Confucianist, and so on.
 Plan whether you will have a church wedding or a wedding performed by a Justice of the Peace.
 Religion is a sensitive subject for many, so if things take a turn toward hostility, it's best to leave it alone. However, peaceful and insightful discussions can be intellectually satisfying, so if both of you are able to handle it, go for it.
 It's very hurtful to be told that what you truly feel is wrong or something to be looked down upon -- by your own spouse nonetheless. If you do feel that way, try to overcome them, or at least keep them to yourself.
 This will cause marital problems and will not help. Besides, their "faith" would probably come from superficial reasons instead of true belief in God. By that same token, nor should your spouse try to force you into his/her Atheism, nor mock your beliefs. That too, will cause marital problems, as your faith is really sacred to you.
 Explain that they can come to you if they have a problem, or if they feel that you aren't respecting them, and that you can discuss it together without anger on your part. Then, ask that they do the same for you if you feel that they aren't respecting you.
 Sometimes, you just won't be able to see things their way, and the same goes for them. If your spouse and you are constantly butting heads on the issue of religion, it may be best to learn how to walk away and accept that your views are different.

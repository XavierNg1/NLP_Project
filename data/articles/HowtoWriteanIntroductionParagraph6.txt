 If this is the case, you can directly call out this mistaken belief in the first line of your introduction paragraph.


When you state this mistaken belief, make sure to clarify that this belief is inaccurate.
 As soon as you state what the wrong belief is, you need to follow your statement with a sentence about the corrected version or truth of the situation.


This sentence should introduce the general topic of the paper and open the path for your thesis statement.
 Provide supporting evidence or facts about your correction to further cement the truth of it in the reader's mind.


These pieces of supporting evidence usually correspond to the main ideas you will cover in the body paragraphs of your essay.
 With the general topic introduced and supporting evidence provided, you can now make a definitive thesis statement about what you will cover in your essay.


A thesis statement is a single sentence that defines a specific point or idea about a broader topic that your entire paper is built around.
In some ways, your thesis statement will be like a direct foil or mirror image of the misconception you are addressing. The two will be directly connected yet directly opposite one another.

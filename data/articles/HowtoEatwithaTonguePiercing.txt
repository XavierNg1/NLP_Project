 Don't worry, you will be able to eat them once your piercing heals a bit more- but immediately after getting pierced, eating/drinking something very acidic (such as lemonade), or eating something fiery (such as jalapenos) will sting and burn your tongue, causing you a lot of pain. Right after getting your piercing done, it's recommended that you only consume cold liquids for at least a few hours. Try to avoid carbonated drinks- if you're very worried, water is always a safe bet.;
, However, if you are lactose intolerant or have been advised to avoid dairy, water ice is a delicious alternative.
 Once your piercing is able to handle warm foods, and not just frozen ones, begin eating foods that are soft, or involve little to no chewing. Brothy soups and applesauce are a good idea.
 That aside, it's advisable to avoid foods that could become troublesome unless you have mouthwash or a bottle of water on hand to swish with, such as popcorn (the kernels and little bits of it can easily get trapped on or around your piercing). No matter what you eat, be sure to use alcohol-free mouthwash after every meal while out of the house (consider buying a lot of those handy travel-size bottles), as having food stuck around your piercing greatly increases your risk of infection- and is a not-so-flattering look. While at home, you should still use mouthwash after meals, but not necessarily every time you eat, as using mouthwash too often will destroy the natural enzymes in your mouth which kill bacteria.

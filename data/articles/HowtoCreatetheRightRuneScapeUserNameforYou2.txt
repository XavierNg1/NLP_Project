 Your username will be the first thing players see. This is your chance to make sure it gives the impression you want--whether you want to seem intimidating, approachable, talented, etc.
 Usernames can also depend on what you will do in RuneScape. Here are a few guidelines to consider.


Select something that indicates your skill as a pure. If you are a pure (i.e., you only train one skill, such as strength), you should have a name that refers to your skill.
 "I_PK_U", "U_Will_Die" "Godz_PKer", "Zamorakz_Pure" are some examples for a PKer.
, If you want to use something like "firegod" or "icemage" but find both are taken, use a synonym. For instance, you could be "pyrogod" or "glacimage" instead.
 Not only will you need to recall your username for login purposes, but other players will use it to add you to friends lists, enter your house or other functions.
 If none of these ideas please you, choose a name based on your interests, favourite books or movies, or other things that interest you.

 Place the water and the short ribs in a large stockpot. Put the pot on the stove over medium-high heat and bring it to a full boil. Reduce the heat to low, bringing the water to a simmer, and continue cooking for an hour, skimming the foam off the top every so often.








Be sure to use a very large pot, or the foam may overflow.
Keep the pot uncovered as the meat cooks.;
, While the beef cooks, prepare your vegetables by rinsing them clean and cutting them into the appropriate-size pieces.

Rough-chop the onion into 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) pieces.
Slice the cabbage into 1-inch (2.5-cm) portions. Discard the thick stem.
 Take it from the pot with a slotted spoon and place it on a cutting board. Use a fork and a knife to take the meat off of the bone and cut it into bite-sized pieces.









When finished, return the bite-sized pieces of beef to the broth in the stockpot. Mix to re-combine.
 Add the cabbage, onion, ketchup, tomato, sugar, lemon juice, paprika, and salt to the stockpot. Mix well to combine, making sure the cabbage is fully submerged in soup., Simmer the soup for another hour on low heat. Taste the soup and add more salt and pepper as desired.









Once everything is tender and the broth tastes as desired, the soup is ready to serve. Ladle it into individual serving dishes.

 If your character is dying of natural causes, such as cancer or old age, you’ll likely be in a bed or even a chair for the death scene. However, if your character dies suddenly of a heart attack, you may be standing at the time of death and have to collapse as you would with a violent death. Make sure that you understand the staging, so you can plan how you will act out the moment of death.If your character is dying in bed, loved ones may be gathered around. If that’s the case, it may make sense for you to embrace or hold a co-star’s hand. Check with the director to see what the best approach is.
 When you’re acting out a natural death, the scene is usually quieter and more subtle. However, death by natural causes can still be painful, so it’s important to have an idea of how much pain your character is in. For example, if you’re playing an older character who dies because his heart stops, you might not experience much pain. On the other hand, if your character dies of a heart attack, you may suffer from intense pain.You can convey pain in a variety of ways, but grimacing and sharp intakes of breath are effective, subtle gestures that usually work well.
If your death scene involves a heart attack, you may want to clutch at your chest or arm because that’s where victims usually feel pain.
 When you’re playing a character who dies of a natural death, the scene often involves quietly drifting off. If that’s the case, it’s best to deliver your final lines in a low, weak voice to convey how frail your character is. You might whisper the lines or give your voice a throaty quality to indicate impending death.While you want to keep your voice low to make the death scene believable, you shouldn't go for a real life whisper, but a stage whisper so everyone in the theater can hear you. To ensure that you can be heard, practice with a cast or crew member at the back of the theater to check how audible you are.

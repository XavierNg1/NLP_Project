 If oral thrush goes untreated, the lesions can actually spread to the back of your mouth and down your throat, towards your esophagus. If they are able to spread this far, you will feel a severe pain when you try to swallow anything, even water.It may also feel like food is getting stuck in your throat each time you swallow.
 In people with severely compromised immune systems, including those with HIV or cancer (especially if they are taking chemotherapy), the Candida yeast that causes thrush may spread from the mouth to the skin, or into the bloodstream and into other organs. In this case, a high fever will likely develop (unless the immune system is completely absent) and the patient will appear severely ill, will be unable to get out of bed and with pale, and will have clammy skin.

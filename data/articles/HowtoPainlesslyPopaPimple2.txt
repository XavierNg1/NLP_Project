 You can coax tough pimples to the surface and remove them entirely without ever having to pop them. This method takes a while, but prevents scarring completely. Steam and hot water can be used to draw puss to the top of your skin, eventually removing it.
 Ring out the excess water after you've soaked the cloth.
 If the cloth gets cold, reheat it under hot water and reapply it.
 You may want to lightly massage the area through the washcloth. Sometimes the pimple will rupture painlessly on its own. Other times your body will naturally fight off the infection for you, returning your skin to its former glory.
 Once the pimple has disappeared, clean the area and apply an anti-bacterial like Neosporin to clean the wound.

 Keep food in covered containers and utensils clean. Discard any food that has come in contact with flood water, been at room temperature for more than two hours, or that has an unusual odor, color, or texture. Also discard foods from cans that are swollen, dented, or corroded, even though the product may look safe to eat.


Thawed food usually can be eaten if it is still “refrigerator cold.” It can be re-frozen if it still contains ice crystals. To be safe, remember, “When in doubt, throw it out.”

, Alternative cooking sources in times of emergency include candle warmers, chafing dishes, fondue pots, or a fireplace. Although canned food can be eaten out of the can without warming, you can heat the contents by removing the label, thoroughly washing and disinfecting the can (use a diluted solution of one part bleach to 10 parts water), and opening the can before heating.
 If the weather is cold enough, set food outside, perhaps in a hole in the ground or buried in the snow. Or, use dry ice. 25 pounds of dry ice will keep a 10-cubic-foot freezer below freezing for 3-4 days. Use care when handling dry ice, and wear dry, heavy gloves to avoid injury.
 Do not allow garbage to accumulate inside, both for fire and sanitation reasons.

 If you're using your landline phone, to start simply dial *98. This will prompt the phone to bring you to an automated menu that allows you to change your voicemail., From here, an automated voice will ask you to provide your four digit PIN. This will allow the system to identify your account and then provide you access to your voicemail. If this is your first time accessing your account through your phone, you may not have set up a PIN yet. Your default PIN is the last four digits of your home phone number.If you set up your PIN, but forgot, you can dial 6-1-1 to reset your PIN.
 Once you enter your pin, an automated voice will guide you through the process of setting up your voicemail. Listen closely. Usually, you can press a number to have the voice repeat information.First, you'll be asked to set up your 4-digit PIN followed by the (#) key. Pick a PIN that you will remember, but not one others can easily figure out. For example, do not choose a PIN like "4444." However, if your cat's birthday is May 31st, the PIN 0531 may be good for you. Write this number down as you will be prompted to re-enter your PIN later.
The system will then ask you to state your name and press the (#) key.
 The automated system will give you a chance to record your voicemail message. Your message can be a maximum of 3 minutes long.If you use your home phone for work, keep the message brief and professional. Try something like, "You've reached the home of Rebecca Peters. I'm not in right now, so please leave a message after the tone."
If you rarely take work calls at home, feel free to leave a fun or goofy message on your voicemail. However, keep in mind these kinds of messages can sometimes be irritating to friends and family members, especially if they run long.
 Once you've recorded your message, you can press "2" to listen to it. If you're satisfied, press "1" to set this as your greeting. If you want to record a different greeting, press "3" to record again.

 Place the copper wire onto a flat surface that won't be damaged by a knife, like a cutting board. You'll be cutting into plastic, and the knife will likely cut into whatever surface you're working on., Use a fine cutting tool like a razor blade to make a slit in the plastic casing that's around the wire. You can also use a wire stripper or pliers with a blade. Make a slit that goes completely around the casing of the wire.








Use thick gloves to avoid cutting yourself when cutting the copper wire.Be careful not to cut all the way though the copper wire when you cut the casing.
 Slide the casing that's been cut and remove it from the copper wire. You should be able to separate the plastic portion from the wire by pulling on it. If there are portions of the plastic that aren't coming lose, go over them with a razor blade again.

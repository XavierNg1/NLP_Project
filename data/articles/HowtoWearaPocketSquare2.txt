 Like other accessories, the color of your pocket square will contribute to the overall effect of your outfit. Pull together shades that blend naturally to the eye. Create depth by pairing a dark suit with a square in a lighter hue, or a muted ensemble with a bold or contrasting color.Colors that are similar but not identical tend to clash, which can result in a disorganized look.
Itâ€™s a good idea to pick out your outfit first before deciding which tie, pocket square and other accessories will go with it best.
 If you're decked out in multiple patterns, it's a good idea to make sure that they're different enough to keep from being jarring. That way, the large, uniform pattern on your tie won't have to compete with the small, intricate one on your pocket square.Your safest bet is to go with a different design for each of your major accessories, or at the very least a different size or color scheme.A gingham pocket square, for instance, will be a bit much set against a pinstriped suit, but will look right at home on a solid one with a lightly textured tie.
Avoid matching your pocket square to your tie, or to the suit itself. If you're going to coordinate it with another article of clothing, it should be your shirt., In general, you should go with a fold that you like and think looks good. However, there are times when one style or another will be preferable. Certain folds, like the three-point or crown fold, are better suited to formal settings. The square fold, basic double peak and other simple folds, on the other hand, are more versatile and can be worn to just about any event.The fold you use should be dictated by the image your attire presents as well as where you'll be wearing it.One important thing to keep in mind is that a fold that's too fancy can actually become a distraction.

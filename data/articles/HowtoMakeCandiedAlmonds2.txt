 Try allspice, nutmeg, or even a dash of cocoa powder.


You could also use a full cup of white sugar if desired. Honey could be substituted for 1/4 cup brown sugar if you want something a little lighter, too., A heavy-bottomed pan holds and distributed heat much more evenly than a cheap, thin skillet. A good pan leads to crispier, crunchier, and less-burned almonds. Get the water to a light simmer, moving on to the next step of prep while it heats.


Don't use too big of a pan, which spreads the water out too thin. 9" or so should be fine for 2 cups of almonds., This is for the almonds once they've finished cooking. However, you need to get the nuts out of the pan quickly when done, so you'll want to have this sheet handy before you start cooking., All of the sugar should be dissolved, and the water will have a nice low boil. Stir the sugar as it dissolves to speed up the process.
 Keep stirring to prevent burning. The mixture will begin to thicken as it coats the almonds. Once it has turned to a drier, flakier coating on the almonds, they're ready to cool.


If you want extra-crunchy almonds, use 2 cups of roasted almonds.
For a slightly less crispy snack, use 2 cups of raw almonds., They should be ready to eat after a few minutes, when the liquid around them has completely crystallized and hardened.

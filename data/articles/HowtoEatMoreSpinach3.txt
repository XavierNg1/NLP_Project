 Sautee a cup (150 grams) of peas, a spoonful of diced garlic, and a handful of spinach in two tablespoons of olive oil. Add two cups (105 grams) of cooked macaroni noodles, a squeeze of lemon juice, and salt and pepper, to taste.If you’d like a richer pasta, you could add a ½ cup (115 grams) of creamy alfredo sauce to the mix.
Top with shredded cheese or parmesan.
Add sliced sausage, to taste.
 A spinach salad might consist of mixed greens – lettuce, arugula, and/or kale – alongside spinach, or it might consist purely of spinach. Add salad toppings that you enjoy and consume.For instance, you might craft your spinach salad with four cups (900 grams) of spinach and top it with one tablespoon of Caesar dressing, ½ cup (15 grams) of croutons, six or seven sliced cucumbers, and four tomato wedges.
You can also try adding dried fruit and crumbled feta cheese with a vinegar-based salad dressing.
 Spinach can be added to any soup. Just throw a few handfuls into the soup of your choice, then heat the soup as you normally would. By the time it’s ready, your spinach will be wilted and delicious. Pea and lentil soups complement spinach well.Alternately, you could make a soup specifically intended for spinach content.For example, you might make a lentil spinach soup. Dice one onion and three carrots. Sauté them in a large pot over medium heat for seven minutes.
Mince four cloves of garlic and rinse two cups (400 grams) of lentils. You can use green or brown lentils.
Put the garlic in the stockpot along with 1.5 teaspoons cumin, one teaspoon smoked paprika, and ¼ teaspoon salt to the stockpot. Sauté for one minute.
Add the lentils, one (15-ounce/425-gram) can of diced tomatoes, four cups (946 milliliters) vegetable broth, and three cups (710 milliliters) water to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 25 minutes.
Add five ounces (142 grams) of roughly chopped spinach. Allow to simmer for five more minutes. Allow to cool slightly, then consume with friends.

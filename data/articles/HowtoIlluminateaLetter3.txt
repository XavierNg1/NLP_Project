 Decorate the first letter of your first or last name. Or, choose the name of a place that you care about, like your hometown or your favorite vacation spot.


Start thinking about how you might decorate an illuminated letter for your own name with things that interest you and colors you like. The first letter of a place name could feature landmarks or other images from that place.
You can also illuminate the first letter of a friend or family member’s name, and give your design to them as a nice gift.
 Use the first letter of a story you wrote, or one from your favorite book. Illuminate just the first letter on the first page, or one at the beginning of each chapter or section.


Think of the characters, images, or scenes contained in the story or chapter to start planning how you’ll decorate the first letter. Maybe animals, plants, landmarks, or weather will feature in your design. Or maybe you will only use abstract shapes and lines to illustrate the feeling of the story.
Instead of drawing a character in the story, think of you how you could draw the interests of that character or components of their life for your letter decoration.
 Decorate each letter of the alphabet as a fun way to create a unique design for each letter. This can also be a great way to practice making illuminated letters of all kinds.


Try creating each illuminated letter with images that begin with that letter. For instance, you could decorate the letter “A” with apples, alligators, and airplanes.
This can be a great project for teachers or parents of children beginning to learn their letters and words.

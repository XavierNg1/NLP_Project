 Creams will help moisturize your skin while you remove your makeup. Try to avoid gel and lotion makeup removers, as well as wipes. These removers are more likely to contain alcohol or fragrances, which can irritate your skin., After you have removed your makeup, use a gentle cleanser, like a cream-based cleanser, and warm water to clean your face. Once your face is clean, pat it dry with a clean towel. Then apply any topical treatments prescribed by your doctor or a moisturizer to treat your skin and reduce scaling.Avoid abrasive scrubs and exfoliators that can further irritate your skin. Only exfoliate per your dermatologistâ€™s instructions.
 Try not to wear makeup every day. Limit your makeup wearing to only a few days a week, or on necessary days like important work days. This way, your skin can breathe and heal.

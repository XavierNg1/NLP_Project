 Peel, pit, and chop the peaches. Dice the onion. Slice open a red bell pepper, remove the seeds, then dice it up. Mince ½ to 1 jalapeño pepper. Lastly, mince the fresh mint leaves.

You can use more than 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of mint for a smoother flavor.
 Place the peaches into a large mixing bowl. Add the red pepper, onion, and jalapeño pepper. Top it off with the minced mint. Gently stir everything together., Squeeze the lime juice over the salsa, then add some salt. Stir everything together once more and give it a taste. If it is not salty enough, add a little bit more salt., Cover the bowl with a sheet of plastic wrap, then place it in the fridge. Leave it there for 1 hour. This allows all of the flavors to blend together. It will also taste more refreshing this way.

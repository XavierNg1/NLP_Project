, Type in your name, phone number and mail address. Other information is optional.
 You need to do the same for in the other phone which you want to track.
 Go to the 1st phone's GhosTrack apps and press the ghost plus icon to create the data for the desired phone which you want to track. Again, you need to give the phone number, name and mail address for the ghost.
 For tracking his current location from home screen of the apps press current position. It will take you to the ghost tab.


Let us assume you want to track "X"; you will find "X" over there. Press "X" and a SMS will be sent. You will see the sending report. Then, you will automatically see the current position.
For spy mode, you need to do the same thing. Just press the button called spy mode. Again, it will ask for confirmation; if you proceed, it will start tracking.



Press the top right button; you will find the settings option over there. Press enter. You will find a statement called "low battery notification".

If you tag it, it will enable low charge notifications. This means that, if the charge level of the phone is in an alarming situation, the phone automatically sends a SMS to any other member. Battery level and the member is user defined.
 From here, you can select the minimum distance or time for the spy mode. Also, by not clicking it, no one can track you from any other phone. It allows required privacy.

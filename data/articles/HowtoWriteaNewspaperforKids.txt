 Comics? Book reviews? Food critics? Advice column? Latest fashion? Remember this article is how to make a newspaper for your kids, so pick stuff that will spark kids' interests!;
, Breaking news or the main topic goes on the front. But do whatever you feel like!

,, You may need permission, so be careful!

, It can be comics (sometimes kids are best for drawing-type stuff), book reviews(from bookworms and book critics), food critics(food-lovers), an advice column(preferably a woman write that one), latest fashion(from fashionistas), and so much more. You can do a little research on what stuff gets put into a newspaper.
 Weekly? Biweekly? Monthly? It doesn't matter, just take time to write a good paper that kids will love!

 As of 2014, the average cost of a neck lift in the United States was around $4,300. However, the price can vary significantly. While this procedure is expensive, this is because it is a surgery that should be done by a board certified plastic surgeon.Unless you can demonstrate to your insurance company that you need a neck lift for a medical reason, it likely will not be covered.
 A neck lift is not a minor surgery. You will be sedated, and the surgery will generally last two to three hours. Excess skin will be removed around the jaw area, and the surgeon may also alter the muscles to give you the appearance you want.If you have medical issues such as diabetes, alcoholism, heart disease, high blood pressure, or depression, you may not be a good candidate for cosmetic surgery. Additionally, smokers are sometimes not good candidates for cosmetic surgery., As this is a major surgery, you will need to undergo a thorough medical examination. You may have to stop taking certain medications, and if you smoke, you will need to quit. Your doctor will advise you on the risks to be aware of, as well as how to take care of yourself during recovery time.Before the surgery, you should avoid taking aspirin or other anti-inflammatory drugs because they can cause excess bleeding.
Be sure to arrange transportation home from the surgery. As you will undergo general anesthesia, it will not be a good idea to try and drive yourself.
 As this is an invasive surgery, you will need time to recover. You will likely be asked to refrain from exercising for at least three weeks. During recovery, you may experience discomfort around your jaw. For example, you might experience swelling and bruising, a pulling sensation, tingling, or even burning.As with all surgeries, infection is a risk. As you are recovering, keep an eye on your temperature. If you develop a fever, contact your doctor right away.

 To make the traditional Slurpee that's found at gas stations, it'll be necessary for you to carbonate your drink.


You can experiment with flavored club sodas to see how that will affect the taste of the Slurpee at the end.
Remember not to leave the club soda in your freezer for too long or it may freeze. Set a timer to remind you to take it out.;
, The other ingredients can be mixed with your club soda in any order.


Maricheno cherry juice can act as an alternative to cherry extract.You can also use fresh or frozen fruit during this stage to add flavor., Combining the ingredients together will ensure that the Kool-Aid, cherry extract, and sugar are sufficiently mixed. Make sure there are no clumps in your blender from the sugar or Kool-Aid mix.


You can use any flavor of Kool-Aid. Choose a flavor that you like best and see how it is in Slurpee form., Mix the drink until it's slushy. Be careful not to blend it so much that the ice melts, and it becomes liquid. It should have a slushy consistency, and the ice should be broken up into little pieces.
 Chilling your Slurpee will allow it to thicken. Once you remove it, you can stir it with a fork or spoon to loosen it up before drinking.You can put your blender in the freezer or pour out your Slurpee into a glass or cup before putting it into your freezer.

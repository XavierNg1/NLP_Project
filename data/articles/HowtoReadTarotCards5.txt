 Tarot cards can pick up negative energy that can interfere with your readings. It is recommended that you store your cards in a black-lined bag or in a wooden Tarot card box. You can add in gemstones or herbs that increase psychic abilities.
 It's a matter of personal preference as to whether or not you'll allow the Seeker to touch your cards. Some readers encourage it--the have them shuffle the deck as a way of transferring their energy to the cards. Other readers prefer not to have anyone's energy except their own on the deck.
 There will be times when you need to clear or cleanse your deck to rid it of negative energy. There are many ways to it, but one simple way involves calling on one of the four elements. When using this method, begin by fanning the deck; if extreme cleansing is needed, the cards can be cleared one at a time.


Earth. Bury your protected deck in sand, salt or dirt for 24 hours. Alternatively, fan your deck on a tablecloth and sprinkle it with salt and/or sand for one to two minutes or any combination of basil, lavender, rosemary, sage or thyme.
Water. Sprinkle your cards lightly with water, herbal tea or a plant infusion and wipe immediately or expose your deck to moonlight in a protected area for half the night.
Fire. Taking care not to burn yourself, pass your deck quickly through a candle flame. You can also expose your deck to sunlight in a protected area for half a day.
Air. Pass your deck five to seven times over burning incense. Or try instead taking a deep breath and breathe deeply and slowly into your deck three times.

 Because you will be "flipping" your hair to create a side part, you want it to be as smooth as possible. If your hair isn't smooth, your part may end up messy.


This style works best with straightened hair.
 You will eventually be flipping part of your hair to the side to create a side part.
 How far away from the center part you place the comb depends on how large you want the side part to be.


Instead of pointing the end of the comb straight back, consider angling it slightly towards the center-back of your head.
 Think of it as lifting your hair and turning it like a page in a book.
 Use the comb part to smooth down any stray hairs, and to even up the part.
 Depending on how thick or stiff your hair is, this may not be necessary. If you find that your hair won't "hold" the part easily, smooth it down and spray it with a lightweight hairspray.

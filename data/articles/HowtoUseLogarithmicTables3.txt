 Use this when you have the log of a number but not the number itself. In the formula 10n = x, n is the common log, or base-ten log, of x. If you have x, find n using the log table. If you have n, find x using the anti-log table.

 The anti-log is also commonly known as the inverse log. 


, This is the number before the decimal point. If you're looking up the anti-log of 2.8699, the characteristic is 2. Mentally remove it from the number you're looking up, but make sure to write it down so you don't forget it - it will be important later.
 In 2.8699, the mantissa is .8699. Most anti-log tables, like most log tables, have two digits in the leftmost column, so run your finger down that column until you find .86.
 For 2.8699, slide your finger along the row marked .86 to find the intersection with column 9. This should read 7396. Write this down.
 Make sure to keep your finger in the same row. In this case, you will slide your finger over to the last column in the table, column 9. The intersection of row .86 and mean differences column 9 is 15. Write that down.
 In our example, these are 7396 and 15. Add them together to get 7411.
 Our characteristic was 2. This means that the answer is between 102 and 103, or between 100 and 1000. In order for the number 7411 to fall between 100 and 1000, the decimal point must go after three digits, so that the number is about 700 rather than 70, which is too small, or 7000, which is too big. So the final answer is 741.1.

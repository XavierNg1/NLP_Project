 Tip some onto a "Magic Eraser" sponge.
 It will probably take several eraser sponges to clean completely.


Do not get the acetone on any plastic parts of the dryer.
Wear gloves that are not affected by chemical solvents.
Open doors, windows, and ensure plenty of adequate ventilation to avoid inhaling excess fumes. A "ventilation mask" is not adequate to prevent inhaled fumes.
Do not use this method near flame or sparks. It is highly flammable.
Keep the are well-ventilated, such as running a fan and opening a window.
 Run a normal cycle and check the rags. If they're clean, the dryer is good to use again. If not, repeat the cleaning process.

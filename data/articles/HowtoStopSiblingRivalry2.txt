 Sometimes, the feelings of siblings can be temporarily forgotten by others when a new baby arrives.
 Make siblings feel that they are an important part of this gift-giving process that is occurring. Let them examine and test out the new gifts.
 The idea of sharing so much of momâ€™s time with the new baby may not sit well with siblings. By incorporating them into as much time spent with the new baby as possible, you may be able to help to avoid feelings of replacement.
 Walking away is always an option as is counting to ten. Encourage them to speak about how they are feeling when becoming upset or agitated by others.
 Compliment them when they display empathy and good intentions for their siblings.

 This program will allow you to connect your Outlook.com (Formerly Hotmail) account with Outlook. This will allow two-way communication between the two, syncing messages, contacts, calendar information and more.


The Outlook Connector is free and is required to make the connection. It works with all versions of Outlook. If you are using a 64-bit system, make sure to download the 64-bit program.
Run the Connector program after downloading it. Follow the prompts to install it.
 Click the File tab and select "Add Account".
 Make sure that the "E-mail Account" radio button is selected. Enter the following information:


Your Name: The name you want to appear on mails that you send.
E-mail Address: Your Outlook.com or Hotmail email address.
Password: Your Outlook.com or Hotmail password.
 If you have not already installed the Connector, you will be prompted now. If the Connector is correctly installed, your Outlook.com account will be synced with Outlook.


If you ever change your Outlook.com password, make sure to change it in Outlook too. You can do this from the Account Settings button in the File tab.
 Now that your Outlook.com account is connected, your emails, contacts, and calendars are all synced. You can add and remove items from either the web interface or from your Outlook client.

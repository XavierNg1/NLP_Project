 This article is aimed at those occasions when humidity is causing the drawer to swell and stick. Obviously, if the culprit of the sticking is a loose screw or splinter, this won't help and you'll need carpentry repairs instead. If it turns out to be something else, simply remove the obstruction or mend it.


Check for loose parts or missing screws. If there are none, check for objects blocking the drawer.
If none of the first things seem to be causing the problem, look for swelling (bulging). There may even be moisture present. And consider the humidity levels of the room the drawer is in––anywhere near showers, baths, cooking areas, etc. are likely to have higher humidity than other parts of the house. Or, if you're in a humid climate or season, the entire house may be humid, which will affect your furniture.;

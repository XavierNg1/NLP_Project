If you’re fully engaged in what you’re doing, you won’t have time to worry!, Eating a balanced meal is the easiest way to take care of your body, and having a body that feels healthy and strong is an easy way to feel optimistic!A balanced diet should include protein, fat, carbs, vitamins, minerals, and lots of water!

If you eat a really heavy meal at breakfast or lunch, consider eating lighter fare for the rest of the day., Studies show that smiling actually releases serotonin, the hormone generally responsible for happiness. Finding little reasons to smile, even in the middle of a bad day, can make you feel happier and therefore more optimistic.Smiling also makes you seem more welcoming to others. Meeting new people who are drawn to that sort of energy can have a good effect on you, since they’re likely to be optimistic people, too.

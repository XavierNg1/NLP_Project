 Instead, incorporate Hawaii’s natural beauty into your ceremony. This is especially easy to do when you’re planning an outdoor wedding, since paradise is all around you.


Have a wedding coordinator assist you with finding the perfect spot where you can take full advantage of Hawaii’s natural beauty.
Botanical gardens are a popular and beautiful choice, but you have plenty of options.
 Tailor your style of dress to your surroundings. Keep it simple and consider a less formal dress code.


A traditional white wedding dress with a train would be out of place on the beach, and a tuxedo will probably be hot and uncomfortable for a groom in Hawaii.
Consider casual and beach attire for both the couple and the guests.
Make sure that your guests know ahead of time what to wear so that they can plan accordingly.
 A professional photographer is a great investment, but try going with a very basic photography package at a low cost. You will still have gorgeous professional photos from the wedding, but your tech savvy friends and family can help you get plenty of additional pictures from the event.


Technology is such that almost anyone can get great photos with a decent digital camera and even a cell phone, especially when you factor in all of the filters and editing possibilities that apps can provide.
 The closer you get to the wedding date, the more the services will end up costing you, so give yourself plenty of time to book in advance.


If you choose to go with a wedding coordinator, this is yet another area that they can significantly help you out with.

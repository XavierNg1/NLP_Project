 Whatever domain name you decide on, you should make sure that you are committed to it for the long run. If you’re not, you’ll face substantial tangible and intangible costs if you decide to change in the future.


Make your domain name part of your business’s short, mid, and long-term business plans. For example, try to imagine where your web business will be in 1, 5, and 10 years.
Plan to stick with your name for the indefinite future. View your domain name as part of your overall brand and reputation., While it may be tempting to choose a name that gives a very specific sense of your business, it might be a better approach to pick a name that is a bit broader.


If you sell hardware, it might be tempting to pick a name that directly reflects that. However, such a specific name could limit your growth in the future if you choose to sell other types of products, too.
Unique and catchy names like “Amazon” or “Google” are simple and lend themselves to the ability to expand into different businesses., While it may be tempting to pick a name that reflects what is trendy at the moment, this could backfire as the trend fades. If you pick something trendy, your domain name could go out of fashion or seem dated in the future.


Stay away from slang, jargon, or trendy words of the moment. For example, words like “salty,” “dab,” “respek,” “suh,” or similar words that are popular with millennials now might be a recipe for failure in 5 or 10 years.

 When you have the luxury of choosing between two or more potential recording studios, assess each space for the following qualities and choose the room that meets the most standards:


Size. Larger rooms are always preferable to smaller spaces because it allows you to record more musicians and store more equipment.
Noise. Microphones magnify all of the noises around you. Choose a space that set off from streets and neighbors. Avoid rooms with heating vents, plumbing pipes, and windows that may let in the sounds of birds, insects, and the elements. You must also take into consideration that you will produce a significant amount of noise, so be courteous to your neighbors and select a room that is at least semi-removed from common spaces.
Flooring. Carpeting compromises the acoustical integrity of your studio. It absorbs high frequencies, but not low frequencies. Rooms with hard flooring are ideal.
Acoustics. The ideal studio is a large room, with high ceilings and several irregular surfaces for sounds to bounce off.;

Bass traps. Bass traps absorb low-end frequencies. Begin by installing one bass trap in each of the corners of your studio.Acoustic Panels.

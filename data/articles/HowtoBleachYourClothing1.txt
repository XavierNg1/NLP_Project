 Bleach only all-white clothing and linens. Only include items that can be safely washed in the machine with hot water. If an item is delicate (like a lace dress) or might shrink (like an all-cotton dress shirt), see alternate methods below.;
, Pour out 3/4 cup (175 ml) of bleach for a regular load of wash.
 Bleach should be added to the hot wash water after adding detergent but before adding your clothes.


For washing machines with a built-in bleach dispenser, add the 3/4 cup (175 ml) of bleach to the dispenser.
For machines without a bleach dispenser, pour the bleach directly into the wash water after the wash cycle has begun but before adding your clothes. For best results, it is advised to let the wash cycle run for a few minutes before adding clothes. This will allow the bleach to become thoroughly dispersed in the water.

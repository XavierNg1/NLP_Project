 You can do this on any version of Windows by holding down the laptop's power button until the machine turns off.

Make sure you save and close all work before doing this.
On Windows Vista and up, you can click the Start button in the bottom-left corner of the screen, click the power icon, and click Shut down.
 This is to ensure that you don't get shocked when you remove your laptop's battery., In most cases, you'll do so by sliding a switch to the left or right, holding it there, and gently sliding the battery out.

If there is a sticker on the bottom of your laptop with product information, you may not need to remove the battery.
 Typically, this label will be in a section separate from the "Regulatory" part of the information here. Next to the "Product" label will be a series of numbers and letters; this is your HP laptop's model number.

If you can't find "Product", look for a "Serial" heading. While your laptop's model number doesn't correlate to the serial number, it's usually listed somewhere below the serial number.
 If you're ever trying to get help for your laptop from a technician, providing them with this number will likely speed up the service process.

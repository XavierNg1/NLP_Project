 Measure out the water and pour into a blender with your beets. For about one minute, blend the water and beets together. You should be left with a watery mixture of water and beets.Use a mesh strain to strain the beat water into a container. Discard the pulp.
 You want to have about 1 and 1/2 cups of beet water for this recipe. If you don't have that much, add a little water to your existing beet water to get the right amount. This should not dilute the flavor too much., Mix the mesa and salt with 1 and 1/4 cups of your beet water. Knead the dough until it is firm, but still slightly moist. The dough should have a soft texture.If your dough is too dry or firm, add more beet water. Add about a tablespoon of beet water at a time until the dough is at the right texture.
 Break the dough into sixteen portions of roughly equal size. Roll these portions into small balls. The balls should be about the same size as an average golf ball.Cover all the balls with a damp cloth or paper towel. This keeps them from drying out.
 Make sure to line the tortilla press with parchment paper first so the dough does not stick. Then, close the tortilla press and press down until the tortillas are flat. You want your tortillas to form circles of roughly 5 to 6 inches.If you don't have a tortilla press, roll the tortillas flat between two sheets of plastic wrap.
 You should cook your tortillas on a cast iron skillet, set on medium-high heat. Cook each for 30 to 50 seconds on each side. When you're done, remove the tortillas from the grill and set them on a plate. Cover them with a warm napkin to keep them warm while you cook the remaining tortillas.

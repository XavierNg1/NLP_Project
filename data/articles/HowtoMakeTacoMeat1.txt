 Pour the oil into a medium skillet pan and heat over medium heat for several minutes.


The oil is ready when it appears to shimmer and can glide over the bottom of the pan without resistance.;
, Add the minced onion to the hot oil and saut√© it until it becomes soft. This should take roughly 5 minutes.


If you do not have fresh minced onion, you could use dried minced onion flakes or onion powder, instead. Add these dry seasonings to the skillet when you add the other spices. Use 1 Tbsp (15 ml) dried flakes or 1 tsp (5 ml) onion powder., Stir the minced garlic, chili powder, cumin, oregano, and cayenne pepper into the onions. Also add about 1 tsp (5 ml) salt. Cook for 30 seconds, or until the mixture becomes fragrant.


If you do not have full garlic cloves, you can use about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of bottled, moist minced garlic instead. You could also use 1.5 tsp (7.5 ml) of dried minced garlic or 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) garlic powder.The chili powder can be adjusted to taste. This amount will create a mildly spicy meat filling, but you can add more for a hotter flavor or less for something even tamer.
 Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook until it is no longer pink. This should take about 5 minutes.


Break the ground beef up with a heavy spatula or wooden spoon as you cook it. This will ensure that it browns evenly and more quickly.
For a healthier version, you could use ground turkey instead of ground beef.
 Pour the tomato sauce, chicken broth, cider vinegar, and brown sugar into the pan. Stir it in and continue cooking until thickened. This should take about 10 minutes.


When possible, opt for a low-sodium chicken broth.
Make sure that the ingredients are well-blended. Stir them together continually as they cook.
Add more salt, if desired.

 Vaseline is a name brand product. It is really just petroleum jelly, so if you don't have Vaseline, plain petroleum jelly would work fine. When your acrylic nails start to lose the shine, polish them up with some Vaseline! It will maintain the shine and make them last longer.;
, Filing nails is something you do to your natural nails, yes. But you can also file the acrylic nails. When they start to chip and snag, file them down to look brand new! Unless you tell people, they won't even know they aren't new!

, Actually, lip balm will maintain the shine, and strengthen the acrylics! It sounds strange, but it really works!

, Buffers are also for natural nails, but you can use them on acrylics as well. You can find four-sided buffers that even out, smooth, shine, and buff the nail. Do this as much as you need to maintain the polished look!

, Have you ever noticed that when you are finished getting your nails done, they rub a little amount of rubbing alcohol on them to shine them? This will also work with acrylic nails. You can use this in the place of Vaseline! Good luck!

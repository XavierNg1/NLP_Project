 Every day, write out the alphabet using your non-dominant hand in lowercase, uppercase and cursive (if you know how). At first your hand will be shaky and the letters won't be nearly as neat as with your other hand. However, keep practicing and your writing will start to get better.


If you're a lefty attempting to write with your right hand, turn the page 30 degrees counterclockwise. If you're a righty attempting to write with your left hand, turn the page 30 degrees clockwise.
Do not "claw" your hand. It may be tempting to grasp the pencil as tightly as possible, causing your hand to ball up like a claw but this will stop you from writing effectively and can end up hurting. Take note of how your hand is positioned and loosen it up now and then as you write.;
, Try lifting weights with your opposite hand to help strengthen the muscles. Start with light weights and as you get stronger, use heavier and heavier ones.
 Throw it higher and higher, but don't break anything fragile! This is a good excuse to get involved in juggling!

, This gives you a clear visual cue to the method and helps your brain to picture the same action for your non-dominant hand.
 Ask for some tips and you might be surprised!

, Swap sides with the mouse at your computer so that your non-dominant hand is doing the mouse work––this is actually a good occupational health trick to help prevent repetitive strain injury and it can balance your visual coordination on the screen too.
 Soon you'll be writing fluently with your non-dominant hand, with very few mistakes.

Use your opposite hand to write "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The lazy dog decides to wake up and be non-lazy", or similar for practice. (The sentence suggested is a good one for practice because it is a panagram, meaning that it's a phrase that contains all of the letters of the English alphabet.)

Examine the screws to determine which kind of screwdriver you need in order to unscrew them., Use a screwdriver to unscrew the exposed screws at the base of the knob. Typically, you'll have to turn the screws counter-clockwise to loosen them.If your doorknob has recessed screws, you may need an Allen wrench to remove them.

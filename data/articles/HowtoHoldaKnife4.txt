 Grab the knife in your dominant hand using the blade or handle grip.









You will use your dominant (writing) hand to hold the knife while guiding the direction of the knife with your non-dominant hand.
The blade grip is recommended here, but this technique also works well enough with the handle grip.
 Place the tip of the blade directly on the cutting board.









The ingredient you plan to mince should be positioned beneath the sharp edge of the blade. The tip of the blade should lie completely past the bulk of the ingredient.
 Hold the tip of the blade in place with two or three fingers.









Use your index and middle fingers for most circumstances. If it feels more comfortable to use three fingers, place your ring finger on top of the blade, as well.
Apply enough force with your fingers to keep the blade steady without making it totally immobile.
 To finely mince an ingredient, use your dominant hand to lift the blade up and down while keeping the tip steady with your non-dominant hand. The result should be a distinctive rocking motion.









While rocking the blade up and down, you will also need to gradually move it from side to side.
As you rock the blade, it should run through the bulk of the ingredient at small intervals, creating a rough mince. The longer you rock the blade, the finer the mince will become.

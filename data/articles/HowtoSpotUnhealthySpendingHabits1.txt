 There are all sorts of apps designed to help you keep track of your spending. These can be useful to help spot spending habits that you might want to adjust.The Level app, for instance, links to your bank accounts and tracks your electronic spending. It’s designed to help you learn how to save, and helps point out spending habits that are keeping you from doing so.
Mint is another money management app app that helps you budget. Again, you can sync the app with your bank accounts, and Mint will monitor and categorize your spending for you.;
, When you’re looking at your bank account or otherwise reviewing your spending, look for recurring expenses that you may not think about. The classic example is a morning cup of coffee.While a couple dollars might not seem like much each time to make the purchase, you may be spending a substantial amount of money on something each week without realizing it.
 Use an app or carry a small paper pad with you at all times and keep a list of all of the purchases you make. Write out your expenses each night on paper or review the notepad and circle any spending that wasn't a necessary expense.Ideally, try to get in the habit of writing down purchases before you actually make them. This can help force you to evaluate each purchase before you make it.

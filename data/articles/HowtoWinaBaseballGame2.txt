 Increasing speed is important, because the faster that players run the bases, the more runs they'll score. One way to increase players' speed is through strength-training exercises.Try squats. With your legs set apart and toes pointed outward, lower yourself towards the floor. You should stop when your thighs are parallel to the ground. Stand back up and repeat. This exercise builds up leg muscles.Try hill sprints. On a slight incline, run up the hill, increasing speed in short bursts. Slow down between bursts. These exercises build up speed over time, as well as strengthen muscles., The player should start by leading off the base. That is, the player should start moving off the bag as the pitcher is getting ready to throw.
Once the pitcher starts throwing, the player should start running to the next base. The idea is to make it to the base before the catcher has a chance to throw the runner out.
If the player goes too far, he or she can be picked off, meaning the pitcher can throw to the baseman before pitching and get the player out.
 With a good defense, the other team can easily get a player out with an infield hit. However, faster runners are more likely to get on base or advance to the next base., By picking up speed, runners are more likely to be able to score from these bases, increasing your chances of winning.

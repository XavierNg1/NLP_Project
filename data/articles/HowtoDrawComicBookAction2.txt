 A line of action doesn’t mean dialogue, it’s the imaginary line that traces your character’s movement. The line of action should be a dramatic, intense path that dictates how your character’s body is moving in a panel.To practice, you can draw a line of action with an arrow pointing the direction you want your character moving. Draw this line in pencil and the use it as guideline when drawing the rest of your character.
The line of action should be fluid so that we can see the intentions of your character’s movements.
Don’t be afraid to exaggerate. If your character is pointing, the line of action starts at the feet and moves up through the body, extending through the arm.
 The center line should always be the first thing you sketch out when drawing a figure. This line can even double as your line of action. Once you have an exaggerated center line that depicts movement, begin to draw your character around it.Each pose has a rhythm to it, and your center line is what depicts that rhythm. Say your character is running, a center line that is more or less vertical isn’t as action filled as a center line that curves. Think about how the body should be leaning forward to depict more motion.
 When you draw your characters, make each pose dramatic, even if your characters are simply standing. By thrusting the head farther forward or spreading the legs wider, you can create a better sense of motion and action.


Incorporate expressions to indicate an action or event is about to happen. Even if you’re drawing a character's face in a panel before the one where the action will happen, draw that character so that there is an acknowledgement of the pending action.
For example, if your character is watching the beginning of an explosion, draw the eyes wider, the mouth open. Use your center line, or line of action to depict the character reeling back as if preparing for the explosion.

 If you really want to start strong, use some boosters. On the pre-game screen, select the boosters you’d want to equip for the game.


You may have to shell some gold bars if you don’t have a particular booster you want to use.;
, Once you’re in, analyze how your board is laid out. There’s a key in play and four locked blocks. Diamonds enclosed in glass cases are also scattered on the board.
 Plan out your moves to maximize the points you can get. This can only be done by grouping same-colored blocks together and taking them all at one.
 This isn’t a time-limited level and you have an unlimited number of moves, so you don’t have to hurry., If you’re able to clear long connected blocks of the same color, you will get huge points. Strive for this in every move.
 Bring down the diamonds in glass cases to smash them and score 1,000 points per diamond. These add a lot to your score target.
 If your options are limited to make huge groups of same-colored blocks, go for the simpler ones and clear them out as well. One of the goals is to clear 85% of the blocks, so you need to clear out as much as possible.
 Smash the glass case that contains the key by bringing it to the ground. Use the key to break the locked blocks. These do count against the total number of blocks in play.
 Unlike other levels, the rocket booster should be reserved to clear out the last few blocks in this level. You don’t need to use it mid-game since you can bring down the blocks easily without this booster.


Once you’re at the end of the level, there may be some columns of blocks remaining. Use the rocket booster to clear out the column with the most blocks.

 In order to catch up in school, you'll need to start by figuring out exactly what you need to catch up on. Start by writing up a list that includes all the work you need to get done.This should include assignments that are past due as well as work that is coming due in the near future.


For each each task, note the due date and what, exactly, you still need to do. It should include readings you haven't done, papers you haven't turned in, and other homework that is past due or due soon.;
, Ask your teachers to meet with you for a few minutes to discuss the situation. Let them know that you know you are behind and are trying to catch up. Ask what help or advice they can give.Your teachers should be able to tell you which assignments they will still accept. This way, you don't waste time doing work that is so late you will no longer receive credit.
They may have advice on how you can get work done faster or more efficiently. They should also be able to tell you which tasks are most important to your grade.
In some cases, teachers may be willing to grant you extensions on deadlines, especially for work that hasn't come due yet. If you show you are genuine in your desire to learn the material and get caught up, some teachers will be lenient.
 After meeting with your teacher, rank the items on your list in order of importance. Remove any tasks that it is no longer possible for you to get credit for.


In prioritizing work consider the point value of each task. Consider how you are doing in the classes the various assignments are for. You should prioritize those tasks that will make the biggest difference in your grades. If there is a class you are at risk of failing, assignments from this class will be most important.You should also consider due dates in prioritizing your list. Focus on those things that are either the oldest, or that you can get done before the deadlines pass for maximum credit.

 Paranoia can be spurred on by a low perception of yourself. To combat your paranoia, it is important to remind yourself that you are a unique and special individual. If you think someone is looking at you and assessing you, remind yourself that you are beautiful. Remind yourself that people are busy with their own lives and do not want to follow you around.


Staying confident also means staying positive. Compliment yourself on a daily basis and remember to think positively.
 Sometimes, this means simply removing yourself from a situation that is making you feel uncomfortable. Take a deep breath and remind yourself that all of the people around you have their own personal fears., Sometimes, you may feel like people in public are laughing at you or talking about you. To combat this feeling, ask them if you can join their conversation. When you are part of a discussion, you know for a fact that they are not talking about you in a negative way because you are a controlling force of the conversation. You will be able to prove yourself wrong and show yourself that they are not making fun of you.
 If you often feel like someone may attack you or may try to cause you harm when you are out in public, consider going out with other people as often as you can. Ask someone you trust to accompany you to the store or to go out to the movies. By having someone that you tryst with you, you are less likely to feel like you are in danger.

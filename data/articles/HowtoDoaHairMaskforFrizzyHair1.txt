 Fill a large bowl halfway with hot water. Put the coconut oil into a smaller bowl, and place the smaller bowl inside the bowl of hot water. Allow the coconut oil to melt. Alternately, you can microwave coconut oil; make sure it’s in a liquid state, warm but not hot.Depending on the temperature at which it was stored, coconut oil may be in sold form.
If you’re microwaving the coconut oil, be very careful not to burn yourself.;
, Add yogurt and honey into a bowl with the coconut oil. Don’t use more coconut oil than the recommended amount, or your mask can leave your hair greasy. Mix the ingredients together well.


Yogurt is cleansing, moisturizing and conditioning.
Honey softens, smooths, and helps your hair retain moisture.
 Rub the mixture into your hair, beginning at your scalp and working down to the tips. Massage the mask into your scalp as well. Cover your hair with a shower cap, plastic bag, or shrink wrap. Allow the mask to sit for fifteen to twenty minutes.This may be a messy process. Ideally, apply the mask in the shower; otherwise, do so over a sink.
 Rinse out the mask completely. Shampoo your hair, if desired. Skip conditioner, or apply it only to the ends of your hair.The mask is also a conditioning treatment, thus fully conditioning your hair isn’t necessary.

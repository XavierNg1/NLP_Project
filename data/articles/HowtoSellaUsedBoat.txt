Determine if the boat operates. Start up the motor (if it's a motorized boat) and make sure it floats. The standard of used boats range dramatically. Some used boats are sold in perfect condition; others hardly run at all. Selling a used boat that is in working condition is much easier than selling a poor-quality boat.
Check for surface damage. A boat can run just fine but be plagued with dents and scratches from use. Some of the superficial issues can be fixed prior to sale, but it's important to get a full account of the boat's problems.

Hire a professional to perform boat repairs or fix minor damage yourself. If the damage is extensive, you might not want to put too much money into repairs before you have found a buyer. Otherwise, you might end up paying more money to repair the boat then you will make off its sale.



Scrub the boat from bow to stern. If there is considerable grime, you might consider renting a power washer. A brand new boat would be hard to sell if it were dirty, so cleaning your used boat until it shines is key to selling it.



Snap photos from all angles for buyers who aren't located near you. The more photos and the higher quality of photos you have of your boat, the more likely you are to attract a buyer.



Browse the Internet for similar used boats being sold.






Use the official NADA guide (http://www.nadaguides.com/Boats?nozip=1&nopop=1) for another price quote.
Have your boat appraised by a professional to discover its worth.



Write a detailed description of the boat that contains the following information: when the boat was purchased, special features on the boat, when extra features were installed, price paid for the boat new and price for the special features, any and all maintenance records.
Use proper spelling and grammar when writing your description.
List the boat on multiple sites, including sites specifically for used boats and sites for the selling of all items (eBay, Craigslist).

 When you drive a car uphill, you need more power than you'd use on a flat road. An automatic transmission will downshift for you when you drive uphill, but you can still make manual adjustments to prevent excessive shifting. Using the D1, D2 or D3 settings will prevent your car from shifting into higher gears, which enables your car's torque to be used more effectively on inclines.


D1 (1st gear only): This may be marked as "1" or "D1". You can shift into 1st using the same lever that you use to switch between Drive (D), Park (P), and Neutral (N). Use first gear for very steep inclines and low rates of speed. 1st gear is also useful when driving downhill on very steep slopes — it allows you to the engine to help slow your car.
D2 (1st and 2nd gear only): This may be marked as "2" or "D2". Use a D2 mode on fairly steep inclines, when your engine Use 2nd gear to pick up speed after you have accelerated in 1st gear. 2nd gear allows your car to travel faster than 1st gear.
D3 (1st, 2nd and 3rd gears only): This may be marked as 3 or D3. When your car is is in D3 mode, it will use the first 3 gears only, which can help when you need to travel at a good rate of speed, but the engine lacks enough torque to maintain speed in a higher gear.
 Don't switch into first gear if you're going more than about 10–15 mph (16–24 km/h). Your engine will turn at higher RPM than usual, so make sure you're not over-revving it. A lower gear will actually put less strain on your transmission, ensuring a smoother and safer ride up the hill.


When you climb a steep hill, gravity pulls back on your car and makes the load on the engine much heavier. This pull effects your car in the same way as a heavy load—it raises the base level of engine power required to keep the wheels rolling forward.Using a low gear on a hill keeps your engine running at a higher RPM, which helps generate the power necessary to reach the top without stagnating.

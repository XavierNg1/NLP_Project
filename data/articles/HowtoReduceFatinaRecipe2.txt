 Removing meat from your diet can significantly reduce fat, but if you aren’t willing to do that, choose leaner meat. Most store-bought meat will have a label that says the lean percentage. The higher the lean percentage, the less fat there is. If you can’t tell by looking at the label of the meat, don’t be afraid to ask an employee which meats are leanest.

Cooking meat releases most of the fat anyway. Buying lean means you can reduce even more fat overall.
 Compare the various packed selections and choose ones that don’t have much fat on them. It will save you time in preparation because you won’t have to cut the fat off yourself. This is especially helpful when buying steaks, roasts, and pork chops, as these tend to have sections of fat left on., Although some fat melts off of the meat when you cook it, the meat still soaks in the fat as it cooks. Use a sharp knife and cut off as much of the fat as you can before you cook the meat. Don’t bother slicing into the red muscle part of the meat, just trim the fat that is around the edges.Remove the skin from poultry before you eat it, as this also contains extra fat.
The muscle itself still contains fat, so some fat will still be in the meat.
 If you have time, cook the meat at least a couple of hours before you add it to a dish. Set it in the refrigerator so that the cooked off fat can harden, then scrape the excess fat off and discard it. This works well for large chunks of meat, like a roast, but may not work as well for ground meat., When meat is part of a recipe and not the main dish, reduce fat by using less meat. Even a ¼ or ⅓ less meat in the dish will reduce the overall fat. You can replace the meat and bolster the dish by adding extra vegetables to fill out the quantity of the recipe.

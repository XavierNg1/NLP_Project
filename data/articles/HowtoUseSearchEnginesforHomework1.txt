 Choose the questions from your homework that you need to answer. It is likely that you will need to answer both simple fact-based questions and open-ended questions within a single assignment.


Starting to search before deciding on a research plan can waste time. It is better to break down the question into manageable portions and search for them individually. However, you will want to hold off answering any opinion-based questions until you have done some initial research.;
, Highlight the words in the question that you need to research further in order to answer the question accurately.
 Think of further questions you could ask someone in order to accurately answer the question.


For example, you are working with the question "What social changes occurred during the Industrial Revolution?" Write down "When did the Industrial Revolution occur?", "Where did the Industrial Revolution occur?" and "What laws were passed during the Industrial Revolution?" These questions will help you to get at specific details that will answer the industrial revolution.
 Try to use search terms of 2 to 3 words. They should be adequately specific to cut down your search results into a manageable amount.
 use search terms like "Industrial Revolution dates" or "Industrial Revolution era."

, In general, open-ended questions will require more research because they may include opinion or a comparing method. Fact-based questions should normally be listed as facts on a reputable site.

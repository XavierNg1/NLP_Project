 This is the most common method of payment. Paying by check means you will not pay any additional fees, but there is the small possibility that your check will be lost in the mail or in processing.;
, Some government offices will allow you to pay from your checking or savings account electronically. Most do not charge a fee for this service. This option allows you greater control over the precise date the funds are transferred than a check. Payments can also be automated so that you don't have to remember to make them, which can be useful if you are making installment payments.
 Many government offices accept credit cards as a form of payment. There is usually a fee associated with this service, and the amount varies based on the size of the payment. If the government office you're paying doesn't accept credit cards directly, it may accept convenience checks issued by your credit card company.


If you have a credit card that earns airline or reward points, check your cardholder agreement to determine whether tax payments qualify to earn points. Some credit card companies exclude them from eligibility for reward programs.
 Most government agencies that accept credit cards also accept debit cards. Unlike credit card tax payments, which require a fee that is a percentage of the total charged, debit card tax payments usually require only a flat fee, even for large payments. If you have a debit card that earns rewards points, check with your bank or credit union to see whether tax payments are considered eligible purchases.
 If your mortgage payment includes a sum held in escrow for property tax payments, the bank that holds the mortgage may offer a service that allows you to have the bank pay your property tax bill directly. Check with your bank to see whether this service is available to you.

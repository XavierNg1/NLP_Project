 After you remove both knobs, you'll be able to remove the faceplates that were attached to the knobs. Wedge a flathead screwdriver under the bottom of the faceplate and pry it off. Once it's loose, you'll be able to remove it with your hand., When you remove the faceplate, it will reveal the inside of your knobset lock. There should be a series of screws that connect that portion of the lock to your door. Once you remove the screws, the lock should become loose and you can pull both sides of the lock out of the door., The last thing that should remain from the knobset lock is the latch. The latch is the part of the lock that fits into the doorframe. Sometimes the latch will just come loose once you remove the other parts of the lock, and sometimes you'll have to unscrew two screws on the top and bottom to disengage it from the door. Pull the latch from the door and you'll have entirely removed a knobset lock.

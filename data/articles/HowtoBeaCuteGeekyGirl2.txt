 In the movies, geeky girls tend to have bad hygiene,which is totally untrue, if you're a cute geeky girl. Shower every day, and wash your hair every two days. Keep your body clean at all times, and brush your teeth twice a day, as well as flossing once a day, at night. Use a nice loofa and body wash, and a nourishing shampoo, it pays off.
 Don't be too girly, and actually try to be a slight tomboy. Wear anything comfortable and cute. Oversized sweaters, T-shirts, and nighties are comfortable. Don't wear anything tight and revealing, because you're just not that. Shop at H&M, Abercrombie and Fitch, Hollister, and Aeropostale. Your wardrobe is cute, comfy, and chill.
 Get a suitable haircut for a geek, but it has to be cute, so don't cut it boy short, like a pixie cut, or Miley's blonde pixie. The shortest you can go is to your shoulders. If you cut it to your shoulders, make sure it's cute and sort of like a perky bob or sort of loose and flowy. Geeks also like to keep their hair long, or medium length. Medium length is probably your best choice. Also, comb it if you have short hair, and style it nicely if you have medium/long.
 Cute, geeky girls always know how to accessorize! You should be wearing glasses, and if you do, wear sort of big, attention-catching ones or unique, perky ones. Try to stick with plain black. Also, don't wear flashy jewelry, and stick to hair ties on your wrist, okay?

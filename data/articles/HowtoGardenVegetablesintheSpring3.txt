 Quick cropping is when you sow very fast growing vegetables and harvest them within a few weeks time. The cooler temperatures in Spring will often mean they aren’t as fast as they could be later in the year but some will be available for harvest in only a few weeks.


These include beetroot, radishes, kale and more unusual varieties such as kohlrabi, rocket and bok choi.
In some cases you will only be able to harvest the baby versions of these vegetables after this amount of time.
 Beetroot can be planted in late winter but grows faster when it is planted in mid-spring. Some varieties will be ready for harvesting about 90 days from sowing, especially if you start them off under cloche or fleece protection.
 Quick cropping salad leaves, like rocket, can be grown and harvested within a few weeks. You can cloche-protect late summer sowings of rocket for cropping through the winter and into spring. Otherwise sow in spring and expect to crop baby leaves within four or five weeks. for cropping baby leaves within 4-5 weeks.Lamb’s lettuce (corn salad) is more slow growing but can be planted in November for spring greenery. Winter sown lettuces need protecting from cold wind (a polytunnel works well).

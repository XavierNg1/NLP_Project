 First, you need to go through a period of time when you cut off as much communication with your ex as possible. It will be the last thing you want to do, but being with them will hurt, and will not help you get over them. If you do not have mutual friends, don't meet up with them. If you do share a group of mutual friends, this can be very hard, as you will hear information from them and have to see your ex whilst you're with these friends. Either way, you can still do these things to limit the communication shared with your ex: Don't comment, message or email them. Don't initiate conversation on MSN/AOL Instant Messenger. Remove them from your top friends on Myspace/Bebo/Facebook, so you don't receive constant updates. If you are, stop being mutual friends on LiveJournal, so you don't have to read their diary entries. Don't pick up their calls, and only reply to their texts if they're important. If they comment or message you, or speak to you on MSN/AOL Instant Messenger, you can reply but keep it light and don’t be over friendly. Do not ask any mutual friends questions about your ex.;
, Never start reading your ex’s comments or text messages. Try not to read their profile or check to see how high you are on their friends list. You will be curious, but you don’t want to know, it will only make you feel worse.
 You can have photos of you, your ex and mutual friends in your room, but don’t put up ones of just you and your ex.
 Just don’t go there, don’t try to chat them up during these times or anything, even though this can be very tempting - especially during the first stage of getting over the break up.
 Make sure you do not talk about it to mutual friends that are closer to your ex than they are to you.
 Crying is not being weak, it’s just letting out your emotions, and sometimes you will need to do this.

 In Spanish, unlike in English, you don't use the future tense to talk about actions that are certain to happen in the future. Instead, you typically would use present tense.This rule applies both to the informal future tense and the simple future tense. Use present tense when the action is certain, or when it is going to happen very soon (in the near future).
When in doubt, try simply using present tense. A Spanish speaker typically will understand what you mean, but if your reader or listener doesn't understand, they can ask for clarification.
 Using present tense to indicate future actions is relatively simple. Provided you already know how to conjugate the verb, you simply make it agree with the number and gender of the subject of the sentence in present indicative tense.For example, if you say "Te veo en la escuela" (tay vay-oh in lah ess-KWAY-lah) you are literally saying "I see you at school." However, if the person to whom you're speaking is a classmate and you are talking to them over the weekend, they will understand that you mean "I will see you at school," since the two of you are not at school at the moment.
 Since you're using present tense, your listener or reader may assume that the action is taking place right now unless you tell them specifically when it will take place.To return to the previous example, if the classmate to whom you were speaking was someone with a different class schedule than yours, you might say "Te veo mañana en la escuela," or "I (will) see you tomorrow at school," to indicate that you will be on campus tomorrow.
You also use present tense for events that are scheduled to take place, or that are certain to take place. In those instances, the even may occur further in the future. For example, you would use present tense to say "Me caso el 6 de mayo" (may CAH-soh ell says day my-yoh – "I am getting married on May 6," literal translation "I marry on May 6"), even if that date is several months into the future.

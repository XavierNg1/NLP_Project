 Cut a lemon in half and squeeze the juice into a small bowl. Use a lemon juicer to ensure that no pulp or seeds get into the jar.If you don't have a juicer, place a fine, mesh strainer over the jar first, then squeeze the lemon by hand.
 You will need 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of sugar and 1 tablespoon (22.5 grams) of honey. The sugar will act as an exfoliant, while the honey will act as a natural moisturizer., You will need about 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of olive oil. The olive oil will not only moisturize your face, but also protect it from the sugar. Sugar makes a great exfoliant, but it can be harsh on the skin.Pull your hair back and away from your face to keep it clean.
 Use your fingers to scoop up some of the lemon-sugar-honey mixture. Apply it to your face, right over the olive oil. Gently massage it in using circular motions. Avoid the sensitive skin around your eyes and nostrils., If you have very sensitive skin, you may want to reduce the time to 2 or 3 minutes. If the cleanser starts to sting, it's time to take it off!, Pat your face dry with a soft, clean towel. Follow up with your usual moisturizer. If you have any of the scrub leftover, you can use it on your hands and neck as well.The moisturizer will help prevent your skin from turning too dry.
If you have oily skin, use a moisturizer specially formulated for oily skin.

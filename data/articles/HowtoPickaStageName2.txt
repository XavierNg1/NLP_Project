 You may have been called something other than your real name throughout childhood, and this nickname might be useful as a stage name. For example, Richard Melville Hall was nicknamed Moby by his parents, and he uses this as his stage name., Go with a singular name that is just your middle name, such as the rapper Drake, whose real name is Aubrey Drake Graham.Similarly, Angelina Jolie Voight dropped her last name, moving her middle name to the surname position.
 Use your great-grandmother’s first name or your great-uncle’s middle name. This can help you retain a connection to your family with your stage name., Some performers use just their last name, dropping their first name because it is hard to pronounce or they’ve always disliked their name. Liberace, for example, dropped his first name, Wladziu, and just went by one name.


Some performers may have started their careers with their full names – or with a stage first and last name. Reinventing your career may involve reinventing your name, but you might still want to hang onto some of the reputation or recognition that you already have. Drop your last name from your stage name and go with just a single name.
Alternately, add your last name. If you’ve been using a single name, consider adding a last name to reinvent yourself.
You might also change or alter your last name. Some performers add last names (with or without a hyphen), such as Courtney Cox adding Arquette to her last name when she got married (she dropped Arquette when the marriage ended).
 If you have performers in your family, you may want to link your stage name with their stage names. These can help you gain a reputation and recognition among fans and employers.


For example, Carlos Irwin Estévez became Charlie Sheen in order to match his last name to his actor father Martin Sheen, whose real name is Ramón Antonio Gerardo Estévez. Another son, Emilio, kept the family last name.

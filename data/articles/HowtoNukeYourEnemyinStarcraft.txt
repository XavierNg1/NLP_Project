 This will allow you to build Nuclear Silos and the Ghosts that deploy your nukes.;
, A Nuclear Silo is an add-on for the Command Center. You cannot have both a Comsat Station and a Nuclear Silo on the same Command Center.
 They cost 200 Minerals and Vespene Gas, and 8 supply points. They take quite a while to build, so you should do this before you actually want to nuke anything.
 Without a Ghost your nuke will be useless. When your nuke is ready the "Nuclear Strike" command will be available.
 Usually your enemy's main base will be too heavily defended to sneak your Ghost in close enough to nuke it. So consider attacking a resource base (or multiple resource bases) to weaken your enemy's economy.
 Select the "Nuclear Strike" command and click the target structure or area. All the players will be notified of the imminent nuclear strike by an audio and visual message. A flashing red dot will appear over the target. This allows your enemy to locate your Ghost and kill it before the strike can be completed.
 The nuke will detonate over the area and severely damage or destroy the units and structures in the area.

 You should read prospectus documents. Do not make any decisions under pressure or on the whim of the moment. Check with as many companies as you like. Take your time to decide:


"Bonds" may give fixed earnings. You can choose taxable, or tax-free interest payouts, and use bond laddering (bonds becoming mature at different times) to stabilize your income.
"Bond mutual funds" which are made of a number of bonds may create a periodic payout with bond mutual funds. Some brokers can give you choices with screening of short lists of tax-free and taxable bond funds that they recommend (sell).
"CDs" may be competitively priced CDs that offer a fixed interest payout from FDIC-insured banks nationwide.
"Income annuities" are used to secure a guaranteed income stream throughout your life that's independent of interest rate changes or market volatility with an income annuity.
 Choose from funds designed to produce monthly payments of investment income while giving your savings opportunity to grow. Monthly Income Funds give you a range of options to match your targeted income needs.
"Variable annuities" may have guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits. There are annuity investments with the option of a guaranteed monthly lifetime income.

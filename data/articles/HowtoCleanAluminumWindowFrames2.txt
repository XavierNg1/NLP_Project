 Get your window frames wet before you being cleaning. This will loosen dirt and dust, making the cleaning process go smoother. Wet a sponge and run it along the full frame, making sure to get into cracks and crevices as well.If certain areas are hard to reach using a sponge, opt for a smaller tool like a scrub brush.
 If cleaners were safe for your outdoor frames, they will be safe for your indoor frames. Use a solvent-based cleaner as well as a paste made from a half cup lemon juice and a quarter cup baking soda.However, make sure commercial cleaners are safe to use inside before applying them to your window frames.
 A scouring pad helps dislodge dirt and debris. When applying your cleaners, do so using a scouring pad. This helps dislodge unwanted debris from your window frames, such as stuck on messes from the kitchen. If you don't have scouring pads, they can be purchased at most department stores.Apply the solvent-based cleaner first, targeting obvious stains. Allow the cleaner to sit on as long as the package recommends before cleaning it off.
Apply your lemon juice and baking soda paste second. Let the paste dry before rinsing your frames.
 Rinse your frames off using a damp sponge. After rinsing them, rub off the remaining water using a dry cloth. Indoor frames will not dry as fast on their own and need to be dried after the cleaning process.

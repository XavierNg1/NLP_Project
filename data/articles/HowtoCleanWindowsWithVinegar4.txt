 Using a small amount of baking soda – no more than a tablespoon or two per track – sprinkle your windows' tracks. Once you add vinegar, this will lift the dirt off your tracks without having to wipe it around., Use a small amount of pure vinegar for this step. You should get some fizz when the vinegar hits the baking soda, but you shouldn’t let it fizz so much that it comes up over the top of the window track.








If you like, you can open the window screen and let the excess run off outside.
 Using a q-tip, rub at the dirt in your window tracks to loosen it. This will force it to mix with the baking soda

 Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL) is used to treat 80 to 90 percent of large kidney stones unless they are located in the lower third of the ureter.


With ESWL, the patient lays under a machine called a lithotripter. This machine sends high-pressure sound waves through the patient's body. The shock waves are strong enough to break large stones into smaller pieces, which can then be passed normally through urination.
 This procedure can be used to break up or remove large kidney stones.A long, tube-like instrument called a Ureteroscope is inserted through the urethra and bladder to the ureter, where kidney stones usually form and get stuck.
A special tool may be used to remove the stone, but if it is too large, a laser will be used to break the stone into smaller pieces that can pass through urination.
 This procedure is similar to a ureteroscopy, but it is slightly more involved and generally used for more serious stones.


A tube is inserted directly into the kidney through an incision in the back. A probe sends shock waves through the stone to break it up, and a small tube called a nephrostomy tube is inserted into the kidney to drain urine and residual stone fragments.
The patient usually stays in the hospital for two or three days following the initial procedure.

 Phone cord detanglers are devices that you can use to connect the phone cord to the phone itself. Rather than allowing the phone to tangle as you move it around, the detangler will spin or rotate in response to the energy built up twisted phone cord., Unplug the cord from the phone and let the handset rest or your desk or the on the floor. Then firmly take hold of the cord between your first fingers and thumb. Pull the cord along, running your fingers down it as you go and pulling through the tangles along the way.
 Plug the cord into the detangler, then connect the detangler to the phone.
 Give the detangler a try. It should respond to relatively small amounts of pressure. If it does not, you may want to try an alternate model.

 There are several products available which are made for cleaning fine metals and jewelry. These contain polymers which buff out small blemishes in your platinum while being gentle enough not to damage the metal. Consult your local jeweler about which cleansers he would recommend.You can also use warm water and mild soap if the platinum is not terribly tarnished. Use a cleanser for a deeper clean.;
, A good choice is an old soft-bristled tooth brush. Dip the brush in your cleanser and gently scrub any tarnish from your platinum.Apply cleanser in the direction of the grain of the metal.
 Run some lukewarm water and rinse the platinum until all of the cleanser has been removed. If you notice some spots which still need cleaning, run the brush over these areas and rinse again.It is a good idea to stop the drain in the sink while you are rinsing your platinum so you donâ€™t lose anything if it slips out of your hand.
 Avoid cotton cloths and towels, which could leave residue on your jewelry. For a really clean, dry finish, wipe the platinum clean with a microfiber cloth or a chamois to give it a nice shine., While it is safe to clean your platinum with a commercial cleaner, any diamonds or precious stones set in the platinum could be more susceptible to damage.Check with your jeweler before you use cleanser on a piece of platinum that is mixed with other metals and precious stones.

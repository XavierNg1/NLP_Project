 Don't throw electronics out, and don't try to recycle them with everything else. Electronics often have toxic byproducts as they decay that don't belong in a landfill. If they still work but the manufacturer won't buy them back, bring them to a Goodwill, a thrift store, or pawnshop to keep them in use. If not, look up an e-waste program near you.


e-Stewards has a worldwide database for finding an e-recylcer near you.
 Apple will take old iPhones off your hands, HP takes a variety of its computers, and stores like Verizon often have phone collection bins. Furthermore, Staples and Best Buy will both take almost any electronics for free, though TVs must be less than 32 inches.Batteries of all kinds should be recycled along with e-waste.
The site Capstone Wireless will pay you for old phones, and let you print a free shipping label right from home.

Most cities and towns have a designated collection center for these chemicals, which should be treated with extra caution due to their toxicity. Some home improvement stores will also take them, but be sure to call ahead of time to be sure.
 It will either be recycled or responsibly disposed. Never pour it down drains or throw it out.

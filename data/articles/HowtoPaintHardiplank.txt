 Unlike similar-sounding silicone caulks, siliconized acrylic caulks can be painted, so they enhance the finished appearance of the paint job. Note: Do not seal the side and bottom edges of the siding unless the manufacturer recommends it.;
, Apply the solution to the affected areas, leave it on for 20 minutes, then rinse it off thoroughly (wear eye and skin protection). If some areas of stubborn mildew remain, go through the same procedure and scrub off the mildew with a long-handled brush.
 Then rinse the surface thoroughly.
 If any old paint still remains that is flaking or showing other signs of poor adhesion, remove it by careful wire-brushing, working in the direction of the simulated wood-grain, if there is any. When doing this work, wear a dust mask, as well as eye and skin protection.
 To help the new paint adhere to the fiber cement siding and to get the most uniform-looking finish on your paint job, the best practice is to apply one coat of a quality exterior latex stain-blocking or masonry primer to all of the siding.
 Top quality acrylic latex paints have superior adhesion, so they will maintain a tight grip on the siding to help prevent early paint failure. These paints also contain special additives to fight mildew formation. A second coat of paint will extend the life of your paint job, but is not essential.

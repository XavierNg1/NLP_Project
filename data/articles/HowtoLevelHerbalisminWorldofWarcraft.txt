 The capital cities will always have profession trainers, and you should pick up herbalism as soon as you can. It will take more skill to pick herbs as you go up in level, so keep your herbalism skill current with the level that you are in.;
, You can do this by right clicking the magnifying glass icon on the map in your upper right-hand corner and choosing "Find Herbs". This will allow you to see where all the herbs near you are located.
 It sounds simple, but this activity does take some diligence. It is easy to get focused on questing and leveling, but make sure that you take your time to pick your herbs as well.
 There are bags that can be purchased in game that will only hold herbs. While they will only hold herbs, they are going to have many slots available to do so. It is far better to have enough slots for herbs than to have to destroy them when you start accumulating drops, things you want to sell and quest items.
 If you are a journeyman herbalist, you are not going to be able to gather herbs once you have topped out your skill until you go to see a trainer. Going to see a trainer means that you will not have to pass up great herbs that you see.

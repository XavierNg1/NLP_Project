 One idea is to do the difficult or most important part first. There is no hard and fast rule about where to begin. Just jump in. Let the completed area dry before painting too close to it to keep the colors from running together. If you must place a wet area next to another damp area, reserve a tiny dam or line of white paper to keep the shapes from merging. Use a hairdryer if necessary.
 If one area is detailed, you might want to show it off against a more loosely painted area. If the colors are intense in one area, you might want to soften them in another. Look for contrasts; cold/warm soft/hard, textured/plain, etc. Listen to and trust your instincts., Stop and distance yourself from it. Allow time for it to dry. Stand it up and step back. Before long, the painting will “talk” to you and things that need changing, adding to or taking away will become obvious., Use a scrubbing brush with short bristles in tiny areas and a piece of white eraser pad for the kitchen to remove or lighten larger spans of color. Once again, allow the piece to dry before attempting to paint over an area., Or simply turn the statue and do the dog from a new angle. Using a realistic statue or figurine of a dog provides loads of useful information. You can see right before you the structure of the dog and how parts are related to one another.

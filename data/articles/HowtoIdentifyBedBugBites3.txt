 Check under chair cushions. Look in the seams of chairs and couches. Also examine the joints of drawers.
 Look for bed bugs under loose wall paper and wall hangings. Peer into electrical outlets, and in the spaces where the wall meets the ceiling and the floor. Also look for the bugs in the folds of curtains.
 Sniff for a slightly sweet, musty odor. You may also smell coriander or something like the scent that stink bugs give off. If the area where you suspect infestation reeks of a damp old house or any of these other odors, bed bugs may be present.

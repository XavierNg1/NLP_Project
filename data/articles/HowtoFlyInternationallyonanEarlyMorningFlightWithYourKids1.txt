 Explain to them that they have to start getting to bed early so they're not tired on the big day. Tell them what time you're flight is and how far away the airport is. Although your kids are young, they will be surprisingly interested. Also tell them how fun the country you're traveling to is, that will be very exciting for them!;
, It's best to start packing early so you can make changes without struggling too much. Pack everything you need for the holiday including clothes, games and toys, films, books and everything else you may need depending on the country. E.G, a blanket or jumper.


Your kids may want a backpack for their toys and games, let them have one but make sure it's a backpack. You won't be too happy lugging around their suitcases if they fall asleep. Ask them to pack everything they might want.
 Even the kids need to know when to wake up, get dressed, leave home and fly away. It's best if there's no confusion here.

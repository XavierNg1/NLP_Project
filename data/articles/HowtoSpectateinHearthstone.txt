, You can only view matches that are currently being played, and the person who is being viewed can see that you are spectating. If they do not want you to watch they can make their games private so it is a good idea to let them know through the Friends Chat that you would like to watch them before spectating on their game., While you cannot interact or make any decisions for the person you are spectating, thereâ€™s still a lot you can do. You can view the history of cards played, interact with all the amusing battlefield features that do not change gameplay at all, and you can see all possible actions that can be taken as well as highlighted versions of the cards the player is currently viewing.

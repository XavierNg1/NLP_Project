 The dominant foot was held back, and the lightsaber was held to the side at chest height, pointing upwards.
 Ataru is all about acrobatics. The main two types in Ataru are rotational acrobatics (spins, flips and cartwheels) and translational acrobatics (running and jumping). Taking up parkour might be helpful., Ataru is more aggressive than the previous forms. It consists of short, energetic bursts of attacks, all linked together. Ataru is very versatile - it can be used with dual blades, a double bladed lightsaber, or even in unarmed combat., Ataru can be extremely tiring. Just think about what you are doing - jumping and spinning about the place, always attacking. For this reason, you need to take down your opponent quickly., Ataru does require a good deal of space to perform acrobatics in. You can't practise Ataru in your bedroom - there isn't enough space. You need a big, open hallway, or even go and practise outside (you may get some funny looks, but hey - you're using a lightsaber, so who cares?)., Ataru does lack defensive capabilities. It's recommended to learn another form, such as Soresu (Form III) or Niman (Form VI) and using a combination of both.

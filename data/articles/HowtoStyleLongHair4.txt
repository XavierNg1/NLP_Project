 Tie all of the hair you want to include back into a perfect ponytail.If you have bangs, you can either leave them alone or pull them back with the rest of your hair.


Remember that wherever you position your initial ponytail will be where the majority of your bun will sit. If you want a bun that sits high on your head, start with a high ponytail.
 Take the tip of your ponytail in one hand and begin to gently twist it by rolling your wrist. Keep twisting until the entire length of your ponytail is a spiral and can't be easily twisted further.Depending on which way you want the final spiral of your bun to go, you may choose to twist either clockwise or counterclockwise.
 Hold the end of your ponytail securely to maintain its twist. In the same direction you twisted your hair, begin wrapping it around the hair tie at the base of the ponytail.Because you are working with long hair, you will likely need to place a finger from your other hand or a longer cylinder with a similar width at the center. However, don't wrap too far up from your base or your bun will not be stable. Keep wrapping your hair until the entire length is coiled into a bun. Finish by wrapping the tip under a coil or back through the hair tie if you can still reach it.
 Depending on your hair type, you may need extra help keeping your bun secure. You may choose to pin it in place with one or more bobby pins or decorative hair accessories.If you have wavy or curly hair that "likes" to stay put, you may need nothing else besides the first hair tie paired with the tension of the bun's coil.
Before you go out, make sure your bun is totally secure. Hold your head at a few different angles and try tugging on your bun slightly.

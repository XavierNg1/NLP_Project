 Use a disposable tissue and flush it down the toilet or throw it in a trash can immediately (don't put it down on any surface). Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer right afterwards. If you don't have anything to cough or sneeze into, cough or sneeze into the inside of your elbow rather than your hand. Change your clothing (if you were wearing long sleeves) or wash your arm as soon as you can. Carry tissues with you and offer them to others.;
, Wash your hands throughout the day, especially after touching other people or any surface that others have touched. Carry alcohol-based sanitizer with you. Offer it to others. Avoid touching your face unless your hands are just cleaned.
 In cafeteria settings, it's not uncommon for people to casually share utensils or take a sip from someone else's drink. This should be completely avoided if there is any risk of a flu pandemic.
 If used correctly, face masks and respirators may help prevent some exposure to flu viruses. However, face masks should be used along with other preventive measures, such as frequent hand washing.
 Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food. The healthier you are, the better your immune system will be at defending your body against a virus.

 The shredder should only be on when you are present. This way, all the blinking lights, fascinating noises, and any chance of it working while nobody is present are completely removed.


Never leave a shredder on an automatic setting. At home, this should never be needed.;
, Keeping the shredder out of harm's way is the most sensible option of all. However, many people like having a pet in a home office, so it might be necessary to find a way of keeping the shredder behind a cupboard door, or a barrier of some sort.


Whenever you leave the room, ensure that your pets are out of it too, and shut the door so that they can't wander back in when nobody is present.
 Always keep food packaging for the bin or the recycling, not for the shredder. Small particles of food may stay lodged in the shredding mechanism, leaving an odour, as well as attracting pests that might attract a curious pet.
 Cords can be a strangling hazard, so they're always best tidied away and out of reach.

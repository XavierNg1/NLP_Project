 For the best results, you need fabric that will fray, so consider 100 percent cotton or denim for your rag quilt.









Make sure if you are using old material from around the home or the bottom of your quilting box that you have enough to complete the whole quilt.;
, Multiply the length times the width. Divide that number by 7 to determine how many squares you will need.









Divide the number of squares by 6. This assumes a fabric width of 45 inches (114.3 cm). Multiply that number by 7 to determine how many inches of fabric length you will need; divide that by 12 for the yards. If your fabric is 60 inches wide (152.4 cm), divide the number of squares by 9.

Have we lost you? Basically, each square will be six inches wide and six inches long. If your quilt is ten rows across and 15 rows down, that's 60 inches wide by 90 inches long.
 The actual size of the finished squares will be 6 inches (15.24 cm); 7 inches allots for the seam.









If the finished size of your quilt is not evenly divisible by 6, enlarge or reduce the size of the squares to fit, allowing an extra inch (2.54 cm) for seam allowances.

You could always work with different sizes of squares or a larger or smaller quilt--just make sure you factor in the seam to your final size; you lose an inch on either side with each square.

 After turning on your oven, pull out a baking sheet and a roll of parchment paper. Tear off a sheet of parchment paper the size of the baking sheet. Line the baking sheet with parchment paper.


Instead of parchment paper, you may cover the pan with non-stick cooking spray., Once the oven is preheated, place ½ pound frozen broccoli into a mixing bowl. Pour 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the frozen florets and season to taste. Use a spoon to toss the broccoli in the oil and seasoning. Spread the contents of the bowl—including the excess oil—onto the baking sheet.


Seasoning options include: salt, pepper, garlic, and/or garlic salt., Place the broccoli in the oven and set a timer for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, remove the pan from the oven. Use a spatula to turn the broccoli.


As you flip the broccoli, do your best to redistribute the excess oil and seasonings as well., Reinsert the pan into the oven and set a timer for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, assess the broccoli’s color. If the broccoli has minor brown batches, remove it from the oven and serve hot.


If the broccoli hasn’t browned, return the pan to the oven. Monitor the broccoli to ensure that it does not burn. Once it is speckled with brown spots, remove the pan from the oven and serve hot.

 The amount will serve about 3 to 4 people.
 Boil the water and add salt, reduce the heat and add one third of the polenta to make a paste, then stir in the remaining polenta and cook until creamy. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 350 °F (177 °C).
 Break it up with a wooden spoon and mix until it is completely melted and combined. Stir in the thyme, and season to taste with salt and pepper.
 The size of the dish will determine how thin or thick your fried polenta slices will be. For thinner pieces, use a large dish, and for thicker pieces, use a small one.
 Bake for 20 minutes, or until the polenta is completely set. It will not turn brown or golden.
 Allow it to cool for a few minutes, then cut it into slices to serve.


Try using cookie cutters to cut the polenta into interesting shapes.






Serve with marinara sauce for a delicious Italian treat.

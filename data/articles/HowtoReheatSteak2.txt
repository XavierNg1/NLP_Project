 Place the meat in a microwavable dish, then drizzle a small amount of steak sauce, Italian dressing, teriyaki or barbecue sauce over the top, along with a few drops of oil or melted butter. Cover the dish, then warm the steak on your microwave's medium setting.









Heat until just barely hot, checking every few seconds, as overcooking will dry the meat. Using your microwave's medium setting is important here -- if it's on high (which is normal), it'll ruin the flavor.
 This allows the fat and juices to bloom and open back up and the flavor to reignite. While you're waiting for this, preheat your oven to 175°F (80°C).









When your oven reaches temperature, put those puppies in for about 10-12 minutes on a rimmed baking sheet. This will warm them, not cook them. Combine them with hot side dishes to keep up the temperature.

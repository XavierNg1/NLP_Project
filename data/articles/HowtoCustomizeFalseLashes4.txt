 The best type of false lashes for this method are the type that are long, thick, and full. Avoid thin or wispy lashes for this method, as they won't be able to hold the weight of the rhinestones.

If the lash strip is very long, measure the lashes against your eyelid, and snip off any excess from the outer corner.
 The rhinestones need to be the smallest you can fine. You will be essentially wearing these on your lashes, so anything too big will be too heavy. White rhinestones will give you a classy look, but colored rhinestones are great for events, holidays, and other special occasions.

You can also use small sequins or confetti for this.,

Some people find it easier to make a puddle of glue on a tray, and then dipping their rhinestone, sequin, or confetti into the glue with a pair of tweezers.
Do not apply the glue directly to the lash strip, or the rhinestones will get in the way. They may also irritate your eyes.
 If the rhinestone doesn't land exactly where you want it, use the tip of your tweezers to gently nudge it into place. Do this for all of the rhinestones., You are using more glue than you normally would to attach the lashes to your lids, so the glue may take a while to completely dry. Rhinestones are also heavy, in terms of lashes, so the glue needs to be perfectly dry. If you don't wait long enough, the rhinestones may slide around or fall off.

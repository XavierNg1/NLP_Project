 Rest the open clip bead in between your thumb and index finger.


Quickly examine the bead. You should notice a curved dip on the center of both open sides. This curved dip will need to fit around the side of the bracelet.
 Rest the side of the bracelet inside the one curved dip of the bead. The bracelet and the curve should line up exactly.


Use your other fingers to keep the bead steady against the bracelet. If necessary, you may also brace the bead and the bracelet against a flat work surface, your wrist, or your body.
 Pinch your thumb and index finger together, causing the two open sides of the bead to come together, as well. Continue pressing the bead together until it clicks closed.

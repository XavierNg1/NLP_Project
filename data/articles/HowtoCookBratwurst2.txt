 Make sure your pan is deep enough that the brats will be covered in water. Place the bratwurst in the pan. Try to not let them overlap. Giving more room is better for cooking the bratwurst.


Alternately, you can add half water and half beer to the pan for added flavor.
 Turn the pan to medium-high heat and let the water heat up to a boil. Once it gets to a boil, turn down the heat so that it doesn’t overboil or ruin the bratwurst. If you boil the sausage at a slower, gentler boil, you will have better bratwurst.If you are cooking pre-cooked bratwurst, you just need to heat them up, rather than making sure they are cooked through as you would with raw bratwurst.
 Grilling the brats will help finish them off and give them a nice flavor. Put them on the grill with a pair of tongs and grill them for 5-10 minutes, turning them over at least once to make sure they cook on both sides. They will be browned from the grill and ready to serve.


You can also grill your brats first for 5-10 minutes on each side, and then boil them. If you do this process, boil them for about 20 minutes after grilling., Check the internal temperature of the bratwurst by using a meat thermometer and making sure the brats are about 160 °F (71 °C).

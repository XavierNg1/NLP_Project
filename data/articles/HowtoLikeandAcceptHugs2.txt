 In order for you to accept a hug, someone needs to want to give you one. You will not get a hug if you look uncomfortable or unfriendly.


Face the person who wants to hug you and smile.
Hold your arms out at your sides, ready to receive a hug. Don’t cross your arms or keep them straight at your sides.
 Are you ready to embrace a hug with open arms (pun intended)? Here are some things to keep in mind when you are hugging someone:


When hugging, try to tilt your head in the opposite direction to the person. If they turn their head to the left, go right. Otherwise you'll end up bumping heads, and that's super awkward.
When you put your arms around them, try not to stick your elbows out awkwardly. It feels more natural to the person being hugged to have your elbows closer toward them.
A hug doesn't have to be long. A few seconds is completely appropriate.
 Does it make you feel warm or relaxed? Did it make you smile? Remember those feelings for the next time you hug someone. This will help you associate positive feelings with being hugged.
 If you are just getting comfortable with hugs, you may not want to be hugged for that long. Here are some body language cues that you could try to indicate you are finished hugging:


Giving the person a quick, tighter squeeze, then backing out of the hug.
Stepping back and briefly putting your hands on the person’s upper arms as you back out.
Transition to a sideways hug and pull away.

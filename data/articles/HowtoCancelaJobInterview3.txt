 It's professional courtesy to give advanced notice when cancelling or rescheduling an interview. If you wait until the last minute to cancel, it could reflect poorly on your business. If this is a potential employee that you are genuinely interested in hiring, make sure to show a great deal of professionalism. Cancelling an interview last minute may cause them to lose interest in your company.If an emergency comes up, contact the potential employee immediately. Give a brief explanation why you're cancelling and let them know you'll be in touch to reschedule. They should understand if it is a real emergency.
 Some employers do not inform candidates when jobs have been filled, they simply cut off all communication. This is extremely unprofessional and makes for bad business. If you have filled the position that you have been interviewing candidates for, let the candidates know. It's best practice to call candidates and let them know the position has been filled; this is a more personal and less cold method of informing a good candidate that you are not interested in hiring them. You can also send an email, although it's a less personal form of communication., If you are interested in hiring this potential employee, reschedule your interview as soon as possible and give them multiple dates to choose from. Since you interfered with their schedule, you should be flexible when rescheduling your interview. Express to the interviewee that you'd really love to interview them, and ask what you can do to make that happen.


If you are unsure when you'll be able to reschedule, let the interviewee know that you'll be in touch about rescheduling, and contact them in a timely fashion.

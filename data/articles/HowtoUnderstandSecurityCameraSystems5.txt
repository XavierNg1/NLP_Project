 You may use up to 2 monitors with all of DVRs. One can be a TV or standard RCA monitor (BNC and RCA are compatible with our connections. All DVRs should have VGA capability, meaning you can use a PC LCD monitor if you wish - we even carry VGA extension cords if you wish to place the monitor as far as 100 feet (30.5Â m) away. Also, each monitor can show the same, or different channels of video. For example, you may choose to view all your cameras at one time, but only allow employees and customers to see certain cameras. If you do not wish to attach a monitor to a DVR, that is okay. It will still record, you can still view remotely, and you can still view on your computer network.

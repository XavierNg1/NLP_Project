 If you want to create a track that will not last very long, you might consider mowing lanes into the grass in your backyard. You can mow a track in tall grass or adjust your mower's deck and mow a path that is slightly lower than the other grass you mowed. Simply weave a path as you mow and you have created a temporary track.If you want to give the track lanes, consider using spray paint to map them out.
The width of your mower deck will determine the width of your track. The wider the mower deck, the wider the track.
 If you have a large slab of cement or concrete in your backyard, like a patio or a basketball court, you can create a track using chalk. All you need to do is clear off the area and draw a track. Add as many lanes as you need and any sketch out any traffic signals.Depending on the space available, you can make a track that is as wide as you want.
 Take some yellow or white spray paint and mark a track. You can make the track small enough for your childrenâ€™s toys or large enough for them to race on themselves. Once the paint has dried, your kids can start racing.For grass, you can use normal spray paint. However, the outline of your track may be visible for a few weeks. Avoid spray painting on any concrete because the track will be visible for months.
Depending on the size of the cars, you can make the track as wide as you want.

 Many modern shooters spawn players in enclosed environments. Mount and Blade is different since it always spawns players on the opposite sides of the map. Nonetheless, the maps are extremely enormous and the terrain of the map is sometimes randomized. This brings a new experience and knowledge of your surroundings is important to survey the land before you, potentially discovering enemy locations.
 Once the enemy is spotted, the player must decide to shoot or not. This concept may be very obvious, however 18th century muskets could only fire a round once and it requires approximately ten seconds to reload before firing the next round. To ensure the player is ready to fire by holding the LMB, the player must stand still and aim for the enemy. Otherwise, moving will give an accuracy penalty and the player will surely miss the target.
 You must adjust his crosshairs accordingly, depending on the range of the enemy. Longer ranges may require the crosshairs to be aimed above the body of the enemy. The enemy are easily spotted if they don't have the "circle flags" above their heads. If the enemy is closer aim for the torso since it is the largest part of the body and will kill the enemy instantly if hit. Remember to lead your shots for longer ranges., Unfortunately, muskets are extremely inaccurate and even experts of the game miss their targets frequently with a hit/miss ratio of .33. Whether if luck or skill is on your side or not, quickly reload and repeat the three previous steps again by left clicking after shooting. Â If the enemy is charging the player then the player must stop reloading and the player must always fight the enemy in close-quarters combat if the enemies are too close.

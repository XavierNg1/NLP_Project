 Seafood is very susceptible to spoiling. You need to keep it as cold as possible before freezing. When bringing it home from the market, keep it in a cooler or a freezer bag to help maintain it's freshness, along with some ice or frozen food., Ice is the most effective way to cool down fish to take home from fishing. You can even use ice to kill small fish, as it almost immediately immobilizes them. Use crushed ice for this purpose. For every 1 pound of fish you have, you need at least 2 pounds of ice., For smaller fish, just set the fish (alive) into the ice as they would be in the water. That is, place them like they're swimming, not on their sides., Slice off the head at the gills.Scale the fish. Use the back of a knife. Grasp the tail. Run the back of the knife up under the scales as you move towards the front of the fish. Continue running the knife over the fish until the scales are gone, rinsing the scales off the knife as you go. Once you've cleaned out the inside of the fish, pack it with ice. Place it in an ice-filled cooler., Once it melts down some, pour off the water, and pour in more ice.

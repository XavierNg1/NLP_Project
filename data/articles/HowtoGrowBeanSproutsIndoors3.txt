 Rinsing the beans removes most of the dirt and bacteria stuck to the outer surface of the beans, preventing it from contaminating the water you will end up soaking the beans it.
 Allow the beans to soak for an hour at minimum, or overnight at maximum.
 Rinsing the beans once more removes additional dirt and bacteria.
 Use a handkerchief with a wide weave, like a light cotton handkerchief. Pour the beans into the colander, on top of the handkerchief.
 Use a light cotton handkerchief or one made of a similarly light, breathable material.
 Allow the water to drain out.
 The bucket should be about twice the size of the strainer, but does not need to be much larger.
 Decorative glass stones work well, but any type will do as long as the bag presses down on top of the beans with a sufficient amount of force.
 You must keep the beans in the dark. Otherwise, they may start to green and turn bitter.
 You must also rinse the beans and allow them to drain each time you change the handkerchiefs. This process keeps them clean and moist.
 This should only take a few days, at most. Rinse the sprouts and set them out on a clean surface to dry for eight hours.

 The importance of viewing the material more than once cannot be overstated. Kinetics takes time and patience to understand, not to mention a strong foundation in math and general chemistry. This gives you time to make notes and form questions for anything that you don’t understand.If you are struggling with the mathematical concepts, you may need to refresh your algebra skills. You cannot study kinetics effectively without understanding the equations.
 You should keep in mind that your instructor’s job is to help you learn kinetics. Your job is to actively take notes and make an effort to understand the subject. You need to ask questions when you are struggling with kinetic concepts, and you should try to answer questions posed by your instructor. This will go a long way in helping you to grasp the kinetics of chemical reactions.Some instructors will give practice problems to be worked out on the board. Take this opportunity to work through problems with the class and instructor to help. Make sure that you understand why you are doing each step in the problem.
 Working through kinetic theories is crucial to understanding the subject. That said, seeing kinetic principles in action gives you perspective about how kinetic reactions actually proceed. Take an active role anytime labs or demonstrations are part of the class to gain a deeper understanding of kinetic processes.


One common kinetic demonstration is the iodine clock reaction. This reaction allows for a visual demonstration of kinetic concepts via a solution that changes color based on the reaction taking place.
 Kinetics problems can be a bit tedious. You may be solving for the rate of a reaction as a whole, the rate of consumption or production of a particular chemical species, or some other variable. To understand when and how to apply kinetic concepts, you need to do homework and practice problems after every class.

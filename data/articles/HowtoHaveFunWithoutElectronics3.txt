 Pick up a story you’ve been meaning to read, or reread an old one that you loved when you were younger. If there’s nothing at home that interests you, visit your local library. Pick out a few books at random or ask the librarian to help you find something specific.
 Pull out a notebook and a pen and start writing. Either brainstorm ideas for a new story, or just dive right into an idea that’s forming in your mind. Try free-writing an entire page without stopping the movement of your pen. You may end up with something nonsensical, but it’s a good way to avoid second-guessing yourself during the creative process., Pull out any old instruments that may be lying around the house – a guitar, a drum, or even an old player piano that's gathering dust. Find some sheet music to play, or just improvise a tune off the top of your head. Not only can playing music put you in a better mood, but it will also help to increase cognitive function and improve memory.If you don't have any instruments at home, you can make a drum using a tin can and some construction paper or leather.
 Gather any art supplies you have lying around, like paper, canvas, paints, paintbrushes, charcoal, or just plain pencils. Find a sunny spot and draw an image that’s in your mind or paint a canvas to match your home’s decor. If you make your drawings or paintings small, you could give them away later as greeting cards.

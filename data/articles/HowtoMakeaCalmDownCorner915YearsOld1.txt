 Make sure it is well-lit, warm enough, and quiet. Clean out any junk in your corner, rid it of distractions, too. If you're a daydreamer, you might want your corner near a window. Don't make it near a door.;
, Choose a padded chair to sit in, or if you can fit it, choose a recliner chair. It is necessary that your seating be comfortable. If your chair is smaller and less bulky, face it towards the wall, but if your chair is bigger and bulkier, you obviously can't do this.
 Try electronics, electronic chargers, books, photo albums, joint pain cream if you have pain, good-smelling cream, candy/yummy food, a musical instrument, etc. Get it personalized. Hang posters and make it smell good.
 Give your corner the final touches. This is the time when you add special items, e.g. inhaler, medications. Whatever else you want, add now.

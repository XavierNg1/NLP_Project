 It's usually installed on PCs running Windows.;
, Go to the "start" button in the bottom left of your screen if you have a PC. Click on it. A screen should pop up. Click on "all programs" (may just say "programs") and another screen should appear. Go to "Accessories" and go down to "Paint". Click on it. You are now in MS paint.
 Place your cursor over the diagonal line icon (it should say "line").
 Then draw different shapes (they should overlap), making sure that all the lines are connected (if you drew a square make sure there aren't any gaps in the corners). Leave space around the edges of the shapes.
 Click on the little paint bucket icon (it will say "fill with color"). Chose black as your color. Fill the area around the shapes in with black.
 Using the paint bucket, fill in your shapes with different colors. The more contrast, the more eye-catching.

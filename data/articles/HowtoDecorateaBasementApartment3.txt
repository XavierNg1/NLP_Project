Use dark splashes of color on wall sections if the majority of your walls are kept white.






Paint walls bright colors such as burgundy, green or chocolate brown and complement those colors with lighter furnishings or light trim.
 For example, paint the living room area brown and your bedroom or sleeping area light blue.
 You can utilize color with your furnishings, accessories and carpets as well as your walls.


Select throw rugs that contrast with your carpet or walls. For example, a bright red rug against a white or beige floor will really get attention.
 A dark set of curtains or drapes against a light wall can create a beautiful, well put together effect.
 Not only will mirrors make your basement apartment look bigger, they will reflect the colors you have in your place.

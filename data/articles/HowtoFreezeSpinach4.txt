 Combine six parts spinach and one part water in a standard blender. Cover and process the blender until the spinach breaks down into a smooth, thick puree.For many blenders, you may need to avoid filling the blender more than halfway to allow the blades adequate access to its contents.
You only need to add enough water to get the blender going. If your blender has a difficult time with the amount of water originally used, feel free to add more water in small increments.
 Once smooth, pour the puree into clean ice cube trays or similar molds. Fill each compartment within 1/4 inch (6 mm) of the top.


If you don't have any spare ice cube trays, consider using mini muffin trays, standard muffin trays, or candy molds.
Silicone trays and molds work especially well, but plastic versions can also be used.
 Place the filled trays in your freezer for around four hours, or until the spinach puree is frozen solid.
 Pop the frozen cubes of spinach out of their trays, then pack them into freezer-safe plastic bags. Remove excess air from the bags before sealing them.


If you have difficulty removing the cubes from their trays, allow them to thaw at room temperature for several minutes. Try again once the sides and bottoms have softened, but before the cubes melt.
 Place the bags of frozen spinach puree back into the freezer. Store them for up to one year.


You can thaw frozen spinach puree before use or add them to smoothies, stews, and similar dishes while they're still frozen solid.

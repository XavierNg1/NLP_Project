 It's the last day of classes and you might not see some of your classmates or teachers for a long time. Don't be afraid to let loose, have fun, and express yourself.


Resolve any misunderstandings between friends or teachers
Be enthusiastic in all of your classes
Dance if you feel like dancing! Sing if you feel like singing!

, Small gifts are a good way to say "I will miss you" to a friend or to a favorite teacher. Some good gifts for your favorite teachers include:


Handwritten cards
Home-made jewelry
Cute keychains
A candle
Flowers.
 Give out little candies or cute stuffed "graduation" animals in little bags. Maybe take a few snapshots with your camera of this day and send them to your friends later via Internet.
 You'll be glad you did! If you want to continue contact with them, ask for their house phone or cell phone numbers or/and email address.
 For example, you could dress in a crazy and cute outfit, wear a cape, do your makeup differently, or do some funny, yet safe stunts.

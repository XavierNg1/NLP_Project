 If you are in a group you are stronger. Try to stay in the background as a hunter so you can deal good damage and don't get distracted.;
, If there are enemy healers you can CC them perfectly so they can't heal anymore and your teammates or even you can land a kill on the damage dealers.
 Even if you are only one player out of ten you can make a huge difference if you play good.
 If you see a rogue near your teammate or you, use a flair so the rogue gets out of stealth and he can't open on your teammate or he can't vanish.
, If your teammates have to gain distance or have to run away, slow the enemies that are chasing them. It will give your teammates time to heal up.
 If you challenge yourself you will get better, believe me. So use your cooldowns!

, Run away and use the nearly unlimited area to kite melees and also casters. Try to waste their time. If they run after you and not after their flag witch is carried by your teammate, it's perfect. But the most awesome feeling is just when you kill everybody that wants to kill you. If you know how to beat the players, beat them and have fun owning it up. Sometimes you just have to help your teammates in order to win. But why not go and blow enemy players up? That's much fun and a very good training.
 If you see a hill and are kiting an enemy, go up the hill and jump down, you will gain so much distance. Try to run away far enough so you outrange the player and then come back, shoot, run away, shoot etc. It's practice but you can really annoy people. I know those things don't work in arena or even duels, but I am specialized on battlegrounds. So you can become good at battlegrounds and with rated battleground, you can really prove some skill. In battlegrounds you can also prove skill and kill more people in a row. Just play many battlegrounds and you will also defeat players in duels that have a very high arena rating. It's practice after all.

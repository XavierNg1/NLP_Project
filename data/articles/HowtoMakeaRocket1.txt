 Possible supports include a chair back or doorknob.;
, The string and straw will service as the guidance system to control the path of the balloon rocket.


Model rocket kits often use a similar length of straw attached to the rocket body. This straw is threaded through a metal rod on the launching pad to keep the rocket upright before launch.
 Be sure to draw the line tight before tying it.
 Pinch off the end of the balloon to keep the air from escaping. You can use your fingers, a paper clip, or clothespin.
, Your rocket will travel along the guideline from one end to the other.


You can try to make the balloon rocket with a round balloon instead of a long one, as well as various straw lengths to see how well they guide the balloon rocket. You can also raise the angle at which the balloon rocket flies to see how it affects the distance the rocket travels.
A related device you can make is a jet boat: Cut a milk carton in half lengthwise. Make a hole in the bottom end and thread the end of a balloon through it. Inflate the balloon, then put the boat into a partially filled tub of water and release the air.

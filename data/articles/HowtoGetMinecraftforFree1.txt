 The downloadable version of the Minecraft demo was released a few years ago, and is somewhat out of date. On the other hand, it's very easy to get. The browser demo is available at the official Minecraft website, and is somewhat more up to date, but requires registration.;
, Visit PC Gamer Magazine online at this address and click the link near the bottom of the article that reads “Download the Minecraft demo (4MB) here.”


Once the demo has downloaded, double-click on the installer to open it and set up the program.
Run the program to play!

This version of Minecraft has a full-featured single player mode, but each world locks after 90 minutes and won't let you create anything more. You can start a new world as many times as you wish.
 If you'd prefer to play Mojang's (the company that sells Minecraft) latest version of the demo, you'll have to play it online.


Visit Mojang's registration page and fill out the required information.
Verify your e-mail address by reading the message Mojang sends you and clicking the link in the message.
Go to the Minecraft demo page to play!

If the game does not appear, your Java plugin may be out of date. Update it to fix the problem.
This demo has the same restriction on world building as the downloadable demo.

 Some CD players have a "force eject" function that's specifically designed to get CDs out when other methods have failed. Because this method doesn't require you to tamper with your CD player in any way, it's smart to start here - you have nothing to lose if it doesn't work. First, turn your car off if it isn't already.;
, Press your CD player's power and eject buttons down at the same time, holding them for about ten seconds. If your stereo has a "force eject" feature, it should spit out the CD.
 Some CD players may not function when the car is turned off. For these players, try pressing and holding the power and eject buttons while the car is running.
 The power + eject button combination is one common "force eject" command, but many CD players may require different button inputs to eject a stuck CD. If you still have it, consult your CD player's owner's manual, which should include information on this and other functions that can help you retrieve your CD.

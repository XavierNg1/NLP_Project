 You may be able to do a project yourself, but that doesn't mean you should. Consider the time and costs you'll entail doing yourself. If it's going to take you several weekends in a row or longer, is it worth it to you to do it yourself?Remember, time is money. If you're putting time into this project, that's time you don't have for other things, including your family and your job.
 Another factor to consider is the mess and complication it will add to your life. For instance, if you're working on the kitchen or a bathroom, the construction may make them unusable, meaning you'll have to find alternatives while you're working on the project., That is, you can save money by doing simple projects yourself, such as painting a room. However, professionals can often get better deals on materials, plus they'll have all the tools to do the project. You may find that it evens out when it comes to cost.Try comparing costs of doing it yourself to hiring a professional. Call around for professional estimates, and then compare that to what you estimate doing it yourself to cost. Don't forget to figure in more than you'll think you'll need, plus add in the cost of your time to the budget.
Keep in the mind that some projects may be cheaper to do yourself, while others will be cheaper to let a professional do them.
 While remodeling part of your home can increase the resell value of your home, often you won't recoup as much money as you put into the remodel. For instance, on projects like remodeling the kitchen or bathroom, you'll likely only get back about half of what you put into it.

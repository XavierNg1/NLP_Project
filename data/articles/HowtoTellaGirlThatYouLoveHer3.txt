 When the time feels right, lock eyes with her. You may experience a moment of absolute stillness – as though time has stopped, temporarily, and there is nothing that exists beyond you and her. Eye contact signals that you are sincere. It also gives you an immediate indication of how she feels about what you're saying, and it should make the two of you feel more connected.
 It's as simple as that. If you truly love her, then you don't need to explain yourself or add any frills. If you feel so inclined, however, it never hurts to wax poetic and qualify your love a bit. Above all, be honest and authentic. Only say as much as you feel impelled to say.


Consider explaining the story of how you came to love her. Say something true, and honest, and sweet. Make it unique, and make her feel special.
The way you say the words is up to you. You can say it casually or earnestly, depending on your comfort level. Make sure that she knows you're serious – unless you want to give yourself an out.
 Give her time. You have told her that you love her, but that doesn't necessarily mean that she's ready to say it back. Be patient and kind. Hope, but do not presume. Let her process your words and respond in her own time.


If she doesn't say it back right away, that's okay. She feels how she feels, and you feel how you feel. You may be hurt, but do not be angry. Respect her right to keep her own counsel.
No matter her response, be proud of yourself for telling her how you feel. It takes a lot of courage to tell someone that you love them, and mean it. Whatever happens: now she knows.
 If she says "I love you" back: smile, hug her, kiss her, bed her. This is a special time. Ride the wave of loving emotion and take the experience to an even more magical level. No matter what happens, this is a moment in your life that you will remember for years to come.

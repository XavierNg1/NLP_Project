 Show the audience that the deck you're holding is just a normal pack of cards.


Show them all the cards to help them believe. You can also shuffle the deck or allow audience members to shuffle the deck before you start the trick.
 Make sure it's just a quick peek that no one will notice. You will need to remember this card because you will recite it as you show the audience later.


Say to yourself in your head, "Ace of Diamonds, Ace of Diamonds" (or whatever the card is). This will help you remember the card as you proceed with the trick.
 This reinforces the illusion that they are in charge of the trick.









Hold the deck face down in one hand. Place the thumb of your other hand underneath the deck. Use the first two fingers of that same hand to pull the cards from the top slightly towards you.
If you’ve gone through more than about one fourth of the deck without being stopped, slow down a bit and joke with the audience to see if you can get someone to stop you. This will make drawing the card from the bottom easier.
 Use your index and middle finger to pull the selected cards from the top of the deck into your hand.








At the same time, use your thumb underneath the deck to draw the bottom card into that hand. With practice, it will slide unnoticed into the bottom position of the pulled stack of cards.
Remember, this bottom card is the one you memorized earlier and will soon reveal as the “guessed” card.
 For a better effect, close your eyes or look away as you show the audience the bottom card.
 They should be bewildered that you successfully guessed their card.

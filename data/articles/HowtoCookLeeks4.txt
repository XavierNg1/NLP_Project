 Place 2 cups of water in the saucepan.
 Add 1 tsp. of salt to the pot. If you use more water, just add 1 tsp. of salt for every 2 cups of water.
 Cook them under medium-low heat until the leeks are tender when you pierce them with a fork. Then, remove the leeks from the heat and drain the water.
 Serve the boiled leeks with 2 tbsp. of melted butter and season them with salt and black pepper to taste along with 1 tbsp. of crushed red pepper. You can enjoy them on their own or on a slice of buttered toast.

 Uzbek has more in common with Japanese and Korean than it does English, meaning that learning Uzbek will be challenging but rewarding. Notable features of the language that are different from English include subject-object-verb sentence order, vowel harmony, and suffixes/agglutination. However, unlike English or most European languages, Uzbek has highly regular phonetic spelling, no irregular verbs, and is gender neutral; learn a rule and apply it to all.Â 

, Native speakers won't scorn you if you make mistakes. There are so few foreigners who speak Uzbek that any knowledge of the language you have is a sign of honour and significant respect to Uzbek people. Spend most of your time listening and try to imitate what you hear as best possible. You will learn Uzbek well if you keep practicing.

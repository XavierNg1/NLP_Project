 If you're locked into a podcast or some tunes, you've got a ready-made excuse for not having heard something someone said, and most people will take the hint, and won't even try. Even if you're not a big music fan, just wear headphones and listen to nothing. It works great as a prop.
 You can learn to look unapproachable by giving people the impression that you're closed off to communication.In general, the physical signs of "closed" body language that help to communicate a desire to be left alone include:


Crossed arms
Crossed legs
Slouching
Looking downward
Avoiding eye contact

, If you look like you're completely immersed in an activity, people will leave you alone for the most part. Bring a book, a stack of papers, or pull out your phone, and put on a calculated scowl, to look like you're concentrating really hard.


You can take this too far and elicit unwanted attention. Don't scowl so hard and make such hefty work sighs that the person next to you says, "What you got going on?"

, If, despite your unapproachable nature, someone tries to approach you, you can cut most conversations off by being generally distant and un-socialable. Avoid making eye contact, keep your resting face blank, and use single-word responses, no matter how difficult the question.


If someone says, "How you doing?" just say, "Fine." If someone says, "What you up to?" just say, "Nothing." If someone says, "Can I get you a drink?" just say, "No." This will get boring quickly, and you'll be alone again.
 Of course, you should dress however you want to dress, because the way you look and your appearance aren't code for being approachable or not approachable. You can, however, avoid unwanted attention by blending in with the crowd. If you're out in public wearing a beaver hat and a purple zoot suit, it's likely someone will want to talk to you. Just wear what everyone else is wearing, and you'll be practically invisible.

 The best way to fight prolonged boredom is to make a game out of the tasks you must get done.;

Pretend there was a hazardous materials spill in your kitchen. It's...Ebola or something. Eww. Deck yourself out in fake protective gear and mop it up.
You're a mad scientist conducting experiments. Now, chuck the experiments that didn't make it out of the refrigerator (where you were storing them). Come up with a nefarious purpose that each one was supposed to have.
Pretend you're a horribly abused butler as you fold your clothes. Plan how you'll take out your boss and keep their money.

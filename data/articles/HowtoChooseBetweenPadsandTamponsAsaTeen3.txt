 Tampons can be sold with or without an applicator. Typically an applicator, which can be cardboard or plastic, makes it easier to insert a tampon. Applicators, however, produce more waste because they are disposed immediately after use. Some people also find it easier to position a tampon using their finger. The tampon should not cause any discomfort once it has been inserted properly. If you can feel the tampon that may mean it has not been inserted far enough. If this happens simply remove the tampon and try again with a new one. , If you don't want to use tampons or pads, there are other options that are generally more comfortable and reusable. These are cloth pads and menstrual cups., If you are still struggling to decide what to wear you could always ask a friend or family member what they use and why. Your friends will be able to help you weigh your options and may provide advice based on their own experiences.

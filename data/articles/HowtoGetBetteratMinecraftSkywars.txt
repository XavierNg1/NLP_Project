 You can go into the SW Lobby and chose a game mode, such as Teams Insane, Solo Insane, and more.;
, With this kit you get a Diamond helmet, a Sharpness/Protection book, an anvil and 64 bottles of Enchanting. This gives you the ability to enchant items at the start, making your gear better than most other people in the game. However, on the map Shire, people will attempt to jump you so use a kit with a sword.
 Just watch out for people trying to shoot you. This will make you take damage.
 But make sure nobody else is trying to egg you off! Look around.
 If there's nobody else around, ignore this step.
 Look for anyone building across and knock them off. This will get rid of a bunch of potential threats.
 If you think you can take them on, chase them. If you think their gear is better, stay away.
 The middle often gives you Iron and Diamond armor (in Normal) and OP Armor (in Insane). If it's already looted, wait for refill and camp somewhere. Maybe make a fortress!

, A good tip is to use a PvP texture pack such as Huahwi's Infinite x16 Edit, and set your attack keybind to something simpler like R (for laptops).
 If they have anything better than you, make sure nobody is trying to "clean-up" and get the useful gear!

, Good job!

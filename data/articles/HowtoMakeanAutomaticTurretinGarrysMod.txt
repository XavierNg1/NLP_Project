, Put a wheel in the middle of the top of the kitchen table with about 1,000 torque, 0 force limit, and 1.70 friction.
, Only check the box that says split x, y, z. Put one beacon sensor on the side of the wheel. Note: It doesn't matter which side of the wheel you put the beacon sensor on, just make sure it's on the side.
 Put the Arithmetic Gate on top of the wheel.
, Freeze the counter and unfreeze the wheel. (The point where the beacon sensor on the wheel is should follow you if you you start to move within range of the target finder if you unchecked the do not target owner box for the target finder. If you set it to find NPCs, then put a zombie within range of the target finder, and it should follow the zombie. If you set it to only target players and not the owner, you will need a volunteer to stand in range. If it follows your volunteer, your good.) If it doesn't follow whatever you set the target finder to target, make sure you wired everything correctly. If you did, go back and try it again, being extra careful with following the directions.
, you can put your own settings for how you want the turret to shoot. Put a couple turrets right next to the beacon sensor.
, When your target comes in range, the turrets will go off and aim towards the target.

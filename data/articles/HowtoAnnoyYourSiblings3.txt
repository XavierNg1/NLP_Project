 A kazoo is a very annoying instrument. Play it loudly and obnoxiously. Do it in the morning, at night; pretty much whenever your sibling is trying to concentrate or wants quiet.


Another annoying instrument to be playing all over the place is a recorder. This time, take the top part of it off, and blow into it "loudly" when your sibling is doing homework, watching TV, talking on the phone, etc.
 Make sure that they do not see you. They will get annoyed, wondering where it is coming from. You can just sit around the corner watching and laughing!

, If you're alone with your sibling(s) and you get thirsty, get a glass of water (or any other liquid) and slurp it. It will drive them nuts after a little while.

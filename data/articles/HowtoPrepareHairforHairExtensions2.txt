 Before having extensions put in, you should remove any dirt, grease, or styling products from your hair. The tape won’t stick to your hair well if it is not clean. Use a clarifying shampoo to remove any buildup from your hair. After that, use your regular conditioner. Make sure to blow dry your hair before moving onto the next step., Once your hair has been washed, conditioned, and dried, do not use any heat or styling products on your hair. Straightening or curling your hair can make it difficult to apply extensions in a way that looks natural. Wear your hair with its natural texture when putting in the extensions. You can style your hair to your liking once the application process is finished., A rat-tail comb has a long, tapered handle. You use the tapered end of the comb to make a horizontal part. Start at the nape of your neck and begin separating into sections if you will be putting in a full head of extensions. Start parting at the crown of your head if you will only be putting in a few extensions.You can tell that the part is too thin if you can see the comb through the section of hair.
 Lightly dip the cotton ball in alcohol. Don’t soak it. Too much alcohol applied to the hair can dry it out. Apply the cotton ball to the strands at the places where your hair is parted. The alcohol soaks up the excess oil at your root, which allows the extensions to hold better.

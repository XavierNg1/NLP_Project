 Since denim is a fairly simple material, you can usually get away with wearing a loud print on your shorts. Bold gray and white stripes are a good example. Make sure that the shorts fit well and appear to be in good shape, though. On the other hand, the denim shirt you pair with the shorts can have a distressed look as long as the denim itself is not too faded or washed out. Finish the look with bold metal accessories in clean, strong lines.
 White is a clean color that works well with just about any wash of denim, but because it gives off an air of crispness, it tends to work better with clean-cut denim shirts that are not distressed. For loose cotton capri pants, try a more fitted denim shirt. For snug capri pants or fitted white shorts, a slightly looser denim shirt may be in order.
 Long, full-length khaki pants can look out of place with a simple denim shirt unless paired with other pieces that can "class" the denim up or make it look more professional. Khaki capri pants and shorts do not have this same issue, though, since shorter pants are automatically more casual than long pants by nature. As such, you can get away with wearing a denim shirt with plain khaki bottoms.
 Denim shirts and shorts are both fairly casual pieces, so casual sandals and flats usually make better footwear options than dressy heels or boots. If you wear the denim shirt with a dressy capri pant, however, you could get away with a kitten heel sandal or an embellished flat more easily.

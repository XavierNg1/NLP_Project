 You will want to be setting your camera to manual, aperture priority, or shutter priority. You can't do that with a compact camera.;
, That is one of the 'cool' things about your digital is the immediate feedback. Film doesn't have that.


Consider using something like a Post It note or a reduced size 3 x 5 card.






Don't use duct tape or any type of tape that will leave residue behind.
 When you buy film, it is 200, 400, and on upwards. With film, you can't change after a few shots. Choose your ISO for your shots and leave it there.
 You can choose between full manual, aperture priority and shutter priority. Just those three.
, Normally, you can buy them in 24 or 36 packages. Obviously, you aren't limited to that, but you don't want to shoot too much at a time, or you will forget how you shot it.
 It helps to keep the whole process the same as if you were shooting film. It will help to keep you in that mindset.

 Similar to smizing, squinching is when you lower your eyelids just a bit and slightly squint. In the meantime, smile slightly with your mouth, but don't break into a full grin. It's more subtle than overtly smiling with your eyes, and it gives the impression that you're friendly and interesting. Some say it helps make a person more photogenic, as it projects confidence and sex appeal., This smile has more to do with your mouth than your eyes, but both features come into play. Teeging is opening your mouth slightly so that your teeth are showing and pressing your tongue up against them. At the same time, smize or squinch with your eyes. Done right, teeging makes you look playful and cute. If you try this pose for a selfie, take the picture from the side, rather than head-on.
 Laughing Out Loud at something funny is a great way to get yourself to smile. Try freezing right when your face is smiling big, and taking a selfie that captures your genuine smile. You'll look happy, fun, and attractive, and best of all, it won't be fake or contrived.

 If you feel your resolve wavering, remember that no good will come out of staying in an unhealthy relationship. You’ll only feel trapped and resentful if you stay. Someone who tries to manipulate you by threatening self-harm will eventually find other ways to manipulate you, too., Your boyfriend or girlfriend is putting you in a terrible emotional position by threatening suicide if you break up, but that doesn’t make their actions your fault. Remind yourself that they are their own person. You can’t control them or make decisions for them.If you are struggling with guilt after the breakup, it may be helpful to talk to a counselor.
 After you end the relationship, move on and don’t look back. Avoid getting back together with your ex, even if you miss them. Both of you need time and space to grieve the loss of the relationship, and dragging the breakup process out will only make healing more difficult for both of you.You should remove them from your social media profiles.
Ask mutual friends not to talk to you about your ex.
If you need to communicate with your ex, choose one way that they can reach you, such as by text or by email.
 You do not have to go through this breakup alone. Reach out to friends and family members for help and support. Ask them if they are willing to talk with you when you are feeling down. If you have second thoughts, they can convince you that breaking up is for the best.

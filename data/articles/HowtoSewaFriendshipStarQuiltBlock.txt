 To make a scrappy version, choose 2 groups of fabrics such lights and darks or yellows and blues. Keep a good contrast between background and star fabric so you'll be able to see your star.
 For example, to make a finished 12 inch (30.5 cm) block, each finished unit will measure 4 inches (10.2 cm) square (12 divided by 3). Add a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance to finished unit size then cut 4 squares from background fabric and 1 square from star fabric., Cut 2 squares each from background and star fabrics. Place 1 square of each fabric right sides together. Draw a diagonal line from one corner of lighter fabric square to the opposite corner. Sew on both sides of the diagonal line 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from drawn line. Cut apart on drawn line and press seam towards the darker fabric., Chain piece units together using a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) seam and press seams to one side.

 Symptoms can get worse quickly in birds, so if you believe your bird is sick, take them to an avian vet immediately. They should be checked out and treated promptly. Untreated illnesses can severely affect your bird.When you’re at the vet, make sure that you share any symptoms. Even if it seems small, tell your vet. This helps them get the complete picture.
 Your vet will probably perform various exams on your lory or lorikeet. This may include getting bloodwork, taking a fecal sample, or testing for bacteria, viruses, or fungi. They may also do x-rays or disease-specific tests., Remove the sick lory or lorikeet from other birds until you know exactly what is wrong with them. You don’t want them to spread their illness to your other birds. Ask your vet how long you should keep your bird separate from the other birds.Place them in a separate cage and in a separate room, just to be on the safe side.

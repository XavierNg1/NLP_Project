 A boy or girl wants the kind of girl they can take home without their mom instantly hating them. They want the kind of girl they can hug without worrying about snapping her in half. He/she wants a real girl, with an actual personality. Not necessarily a Barbie.


People who aim for Barbie-itude aren't worth your time. If someone will talk to you only if you're wearing a Crossing Guard of Negotiable Affections outfit, they're a jerk. Don't let anybody take advantage of you. If you think they'll grow out of it, dump him/her until they do or you'll be in for a lot of misery.
 Geeks are really cool people. They're usually down-to-earth and really smart.
 Guys/girls make really awesome normal friends, though. They're unlikely to stab you in the back or gossip about your secrets, and some guys/girls are more sympathetic than you'd think.


Some people aren't sympathetic, though. They may just freeze up if you start crying, and not know what to do with you. They're not necessarily trying to be mean, and it doesn't mean they don't care. It's just that they might not know how to handle you. They can often find sound, logical solutions to your problems once you've calmed down, though, so they can still help you out a little. Some people like to fix girls' problems.
 Everybody has a bit of an ego, though some more than others.

 This especially works if you name ends in "on" which fits in phrase that use "in" and "on." If you name is Allison change it to Allison Wonderland.
 This is an uncommonly used scene name fad. Examples are like Anita K, Betsy O, Felicity P, Carly or Carlie V, Thora A, etc.
 For example, you could put it as something like, Mel.hates.you, CupidKyle etc.

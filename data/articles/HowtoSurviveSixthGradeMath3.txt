 By taking notes in class and reviewing those notes, you are doing yourself a favor. Note taking is a sure way to improve your math performance.Just make sure your notes are consistent. If you miss a day, ask one of your study partners for their notes.

Don’t be lazy! If your teacher tells you to write something down, or says that something is important or will be on a test, write it down.

Write down formulas, terms, and definitions.

Don’t try to write down everything, or else your notes will not be helpful. Just write down what you think seems important. You might also miss out on important information your teacher is giving while you are trying to keep up.

Keep your notes organized. At the beginning of each class, write down the date, unit, and topic you are learning about. Try to use bullet points when you are taking your notes.

If your notes are messy, it is worth recopying them each day. Make sure your handwriting is neat, so you can read your notes later. You can also reorganize the notes so that they are easier to follow.
 Your school might have given you a planner or agenda at the beginning of the year. Use it! If they didn’t give you a planner, you can buy one, or make your own out of a plain notebook. Write down your math homework each day. Write down the dates of projects, quizzes, and tests so you don’t forget to study or turn in your work. You can also write down the dates and times that your math study group meets.

Review your planner each weekend, so you know what is coming up.
 Make sure you use your notebooks, folders, and binders. Don’t just shove your work in your desk, locker, or bookbag. Many students get poor grades in math simply because they lose their work and don’t turn it in.

Take the time to put your math work in your math folder. If you put it in a different folder, you will likely forget where it is.

Keep your folder neat. Keep graded work in the right pocket, and work you need to turn in or complete in the left pocket.

 By this point, you'll be able to inflict paralysis, poison, or sleep. If you started with Chikorita, it'll be able to learn Stun Spore and Poison Powder.


Paralysis lowers a Pokémons' speed and has a 25% chance of stopping the Pokémon from making a move during a turn.
Poison damages the opponent a bit at the end of their turn.
Sleep makes the opponent fall asleep, preventing them from moving until they wake up.
 Poison or paralysis is your best bet here, given that sleep isn't always reliable, but whichever you use is your preference.

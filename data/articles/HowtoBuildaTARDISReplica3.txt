 Take the 4 outer roof pieces, and glue them together to form a picture-frame-like box.
 Using the 4 inner roof pieces, glue them together to form a box that will fit inside the outer roof frame.


If there are small gaps, don’t worry––those can be taken care of with filler before painting.
 Center the frame structure on top of the roof, and mark the location. Apply glue to the bottom of the frame, and attach. Add the 4 support blocks on the inside corners of the frame, as shown.
 Apply glue to the support blocks, and set the roof top in place. It should be flush with the top of the frames.
 Instead of an outer frame and an inner frame plus support blocks, center and attach one .7u square x .1u high piece, then top it with a .6u square x .1u high piece.
 Center and glue this block to the top of the roof assembly.
 Make sure the entire roof assembly is squared, and let dry.

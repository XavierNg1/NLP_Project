 These are listed under "Things You'll Need" below.;
, For now, this will be referred to as "the card".
 Make it the same size as the closed card.
 On the right side, glue the stiff cardboard to the paper. Cut out a rectangle on the left side that is just a little smaller than the photo you want to frame.


Close the card, and you should see the cardboard showing through where the picture will go. Now, the bottom edge and the right edge of the frame aren't sealed, so staple it. You will cover up these staples later with decorations.
 This will enable the frame to be hung if the recipient wishes.
 When you're satisfied with the way things look, spread liquid glue over the rice.
 These are to represent chopsticks. In the top left corner, add a cut-out of a small, white, paper, square plate.



To make the sushi, cut the green construction paper into thin strips which will wrap around the paper sushi insides. Set these strips aside.






Using brightly colored markers (pink, orange, yellow, etc.), color different tissues until they're solid colors. Crumple these tissues into loose, small balls.
 Trim the tube accordingly, then tape it to seal it.

Stuff each tube with a small ball of the colored tissues you made in the previous step. Keep them neat and "sushi-looking."






After you have done this repeatedly for as many different sushi as you want, dab some glue on the outside of each "sushi" piece, then simply stick them in place on the photo frame.
 Stick them on the frame on the right edge. It's okay if parts of the fortune stick out.
, If you're going to gift-wrap it, make sure you don't wrap it too tightly or else the 3D sushi will be flattened.

 If you don’t have a copy of your cellphone plan agreement, contact your carrier to get a copy. If for some reason the carrier doesn’t have it, then it's possible that there is no contract. That could be your way out. This is probably unlikely to happen, but you never know., When you do get your contract, read through it carefully. See if there are any terms that talk about potential modifications to the agreement, and make note of them.
 Here’s where you could find a possible escape route. It’s important that you note any changes as soon as they occur.


If the contract makes no reference to future modifications, and your agreement terms were modified by the carrier during the contract period, you could claim a breach of the agreement. Be aware, however, that many of these contracts do have a provision that says the carrier can change the agreement at any time.Even if the contract contains a term addressing future modifications, you should be able to break the contract if the change is “materially adverse” to you. Granted that’s kind of a nebulous term, but the reality is that if the carrier has changed rates, or added small fees that weren’t there when you signed the agreement, you’ve probably met the “materially adverse” threshold.

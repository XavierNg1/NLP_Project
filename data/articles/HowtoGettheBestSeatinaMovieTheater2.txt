 Many movie theaters have it set up now so that you can easily buy your tickets online with a credit card. Check on the theater's website.


This will allow you to evade long lines for popular movies, thus getting into the theater ahead of other people to choose the best seats.
Some dinner theaters allow you to actually select your seats. Some regular theater seat selections are first-come first-serve, though, but buying them online means you can skip the lines and get into the theater sooner before the choice seats are snapped up.
Buying tickets online also eliminates the chances you will arrive to a sold-out show.
 You could purchase reserved seats online, depending on the theater. They usually cost a little bit more (a few dollars), but they guarantee you a good seat.


You could also buy a reserved seat at the theater. Reserved seats are often more comfortable and are larger recliners too. Most larger theaters sell reserved seats, although some small ones may not.
The reserved seats are usually positioned toward the back of the theater where sound is best, and you don’t have to crane your neck to see the film. They sometimes have bigger tables to hold your concessions.
You are often allowed to select your own reserved seat or the computer will select the best seat available for you. This way if you arrive late or last minute, you won’t have to worry about ending up in the first row in a crowded theater.
 This sounds pretty obvious, but if you want to get the best seat, don’t show up right as the movie is about to start unless you have a reserved seat.


Get there at least 15 to 20 minutes early, and maybe more if it’s a super popular showing.
The other thing you could do it go on off-times. Some movie theaters have weekday deals.
Friday and Saturday night showings of popular new movies are going to be the most crowded.

 If you don't know any other babysitters, maybe YOU could be the first to decide the going rate in your area.;
, They have a rate calculator. Just type in your area code and they'll tell you about how much you should get paid by the hour.
 After all, they are an adult, and they ARE paying you to watch the most important thing in their lives. They probably have a good idea what you should be paid; don't you think?

, Some good starting price points are:


$7.50 an hour for 0-2 year olds.
$6 an hour for 3-5 year olds.
$5.50 an hour for ages 6 and up.

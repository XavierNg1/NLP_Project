 Asian restaurants often have a variety of flavorful broth-based soups that you can choose as a first course. Choose chicken breast strips that are not breaded and fried. Add steamed vegetables to your main course, and ask for brown rice instead of white rice.
 Ask for a pasta dish to be served with an appetizer portion size, and select extra vegetable side dishes. Choose sauces like marinara, cacciatore, pomodoro or arrabiata.
 Go with corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas, use salsa as salad dressing and request smaller portions of guacamole, sour cream or cheese.
 Order leaner cuts like strip steak, sirloin and filet mignon. Also, order smaller portions (an appropriate portion size is 3 ounces) and choose a baked potato instead of potatoes that are mashed, scalloped, French-fried or au gratin.
 Choose a half sandwich paired with a broth-based soup. Skip the mayonnaise and high-calorie spreads and go for mustard or barbecue sauce. Also, pile vegetables onto your sandwich.
 Order salads with grilled rather than crispy chicken, and use as little dressing as possible. Switch to the smallest available burger or veggie patty, skipping mayonnaise and any “special sauce.” Additionally, when ordering breakfast, choose a yogurt parfait rather than high CD dishes.
 Choose a lean deli meat sandwich, an entrée salad or a bowl of chili.

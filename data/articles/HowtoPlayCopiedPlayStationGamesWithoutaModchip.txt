 You may find it in your old game collection, on e-bay, or from your friend's or family's games. It doesnâ€™t matter; just get yourself a game.;
,, Locate the clips which keep the lid shut. Put a piece of electrical tape on the button below the clip on the inside of the PlayStation so the PlayStation will spin while the lid is open. After you place the tape, when you open the lid the tape should be stuck in the button, holding it down.
 After the game loads to the second black screen, listen for the sound of the PlayStation reading the disc(The disc speed will slow down and then speed up again).
 Wait for it to finish reading, then switch your copied disc back with your original disk.
 As soon as the screen switches to the next screen, put in your copied CD and it should load up.

 Once you have completed your work, do a read-though. On this first read-through you will want to look for spelling and grammar mistakes. These will be distracting and stop the flow of thought as you read through to analyze the content, so deal with these and only these first so that you can focus on the content of the text later.


Make a list of words you know you have a tendency to misspell or misuse. Most people have at least a few. When you are done writing, you can do a search through the document to find the incorrect versions and correct them.
Remember that some words may technically be spelled correctly but be incorrect for the place in which you've used them. Their, there, and they’re are the most common examples. Even if you know the spelling and grammar rules, it’s easy to make mistakes like this, especially if you’re tired. Pay attention.
 Once you've completed your first read-through, do at least one more to check the content. Be sure that the transitions between paragraphs make sense, that your arguments are logical and easy to follow, that everything ties back to your thesis, that you don’t randomly start rambling, and other content considerations.
 Around the time of completion is when you will want to begin practicing your presentation skills. A presentation before your committee is usually required, and audiences are often allowed. Most people do not have experience speaking in front of groups and it can be extremely nerve-racking, especially considering the context. Practicing how you will present your information, first in front of a mirror and then in front of friends and family, preferably well in advance of your presentation date.

 Children often have a hard time labelling and expressing their emotions, and will resort to tantrums or hitting as a way to express how they feel.One way to help children label and express emotions is through helping them identify feelings in themselves and others and talking about how emotions can be expressed.Use movies to help your child label emotions.


For example, in the movie “Frozen,” ask your child “Why did Elsa react that way? Do you think she was sad? What about angry?”
If your child is reacting to a movie, label the emotion. Say, “It looks like you’re scared, like Ursula scares you.” You can also label the emotions from the characters in the movies. Say, “It looks like she’s really excited” or, “Wow, he looks really sad. I would be sad, too.”

, Approach movies therapeutically even outside of your therapist’s office. Find movies that challenge you, help you process emotions, or that support your emotional or spiritual growth.Ask yourself questions after (or during) a movie that can help you improve and gain self-awareness.
 Generally, cinematherapy can provide benefits for you. However, it is not recommended for people who are acutely psychotic.Some movies may be inappropriate. For example, don’t have a child watch an R-rated movie. If you’re sensitive to violence, language, or nudity, avoid films that have these elements.


It’s one thing to find support in working through anxiety and depression, yet it’s another to be triggered by a film. If you’ve endured domestic abuse, you may not want to watch violent or abusive scenes as they may trigger you.

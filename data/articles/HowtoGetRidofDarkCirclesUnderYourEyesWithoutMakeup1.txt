 The caffeine in tea can help reduce swelling and darkness under the eyes. After you’ve brewed some tea, remove the bags and squeeze out the excess water. Refrigerate the bags for 10 minutes, and then lay down with the bags over your eyes for at least 15 minutes.Chilling the bags ensures that they’re not too hot to place over your eyes. The cold temperature also helps reduce any swelling under the eyes when you use the bags as compresses.
Be sure to use caffeinated tea bags.;
, If you aren’t a tea drinker, an eye cream that contains caffeine can have similar effects. The caffeine helps constrict the blood vessels to eliminate puffiness and discoloration. Dab a small amount of the cream under each eye and pat it in gently until it’s absorbed.To improve the benefits of the eye cream, store it in your refrigerator. The cold temperature will further help reduce the swelling under your eyes that can cause dark circles.
 If you don’t have tea bags or a caffeinated eye cream on hand, cold spoons can help get lessen the look of your dark circles. Dip two clean metal spoons in water, and then chill them in the freezer for at least 10 minutes. When they’re properly chilled, place the rounded side of the spoons against your eyes for 5 to 10 minutes.If you plan to wear eye makeup, make sure to use the cold spoons before you apply your eye shadow, liner, and mascara.

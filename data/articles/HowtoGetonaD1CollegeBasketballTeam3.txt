 Worst case scenario you'll have to walk on to that school. Being a walk on means you'll need to pay the normal price for the school (unless you are eligible for financial aid). Being a walk on also means that you do not have a spot on the team. Meaning you have to earn it in a try out.
 You basically have to do the same thing as trying to make the team back in high school. But this time, you have to be at least decent in every part of your game. But most importantly be athletic. If they see you flying all over the court and dunking left and right that gets a lot of attention. Then when they see that you shoot the ball well, they're gotta make a spot for you, hopefully.

 On your phone, text the word “usage” to 1311. You will receive a text message with your usage information. It’s that simple!


If you are the primary account holder, you can also see usage alerts for all phones on the plan. Obviously, this only works if you have a Sprint data plan.You can check your current usage at any time by sending a text message with this process, by sending the word usage to 1311. Both the text message and response from Sprint are free, and they do not count towards your text plan. You will also generally get notifications after exceeding 20 percent increments over the original threshold too.
This short code also lets you request your upgrade eligibility, as well as current usage information (minutes, text and data). Text "upgrade" or "usage" for the different data.;
, Text updates are sent to your phone and email once a usage threshold is passed. That means you will get a text after you use different increments above your data usage plan, depending on the kind of plan you have. Often these come at 75% of your available time, 90% and 100%.


Be aware that a large update will not trigger an update until it is finished, making it possible to go over your limit.
Determine differences among plans. If you have a Sprint Family Share Pack Plan, you will get notifications at 40 percent increments over the original data allowance if you have a 600 MB allowance. The notifications arrive at 20 percent increments if you have a 1 GB, 2 GB or 4 GB allowance, or at 5% increments if you have an 8 GB or higher allowance.
If you’re on the $15/GB additional high speed data buy up, you will receive notifications at 75%, 90% and 100% of additional purchase data allowance.

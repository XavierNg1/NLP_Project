 A compass is a round instrument with all the cardinal directions printed on it. A rotating needle uses the Earth’s magnetic field to determine what direction the compass is facing. You can make your own rudimentary compass if you have a few items available. You will need:A metal sewing needle and magnet
A bowl or cup filled with water
Pliers and scissors
A cork (or just a leaf).
 Do this at least 12 times if you are using a weak magnet like a refrigerator magnet, or about five times if you have a stronger magnet. This will magnetize the needle.
 Then, use the pliers to push the needle through the cork disk. (If you don't have a cork, you can place the needle on a leaf.)

, The needle will be free to spin around like a compass needle, and will eventually align itself with the poles.
 If it was properly magnetized, it should tell you the north–south line. Note that unless you have a compass or other reference, you will not know if the needle is pointing north or south, just that it's pointing to one or the other.


Many websites and books say that you can magnetize a metal needle by rubbing it with wool or silk, but that will only create static electricity, not magnetism.

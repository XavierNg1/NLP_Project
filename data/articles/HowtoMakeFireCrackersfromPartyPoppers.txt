 They can be found at:


Party Shops
Novelty shops and stands (like at carnivals)
The toy aisle in some grocery and department stores;
, There will probably be a label on it and sometimes a band to protect the string to stop it from firing when not wanted (in packet).
,, (There are some fun things to do with these)

You may need to use a toothpick or alike to thread some of the string through the small hole.
You may also need to widen the small hole slightly.
Although removing it should be safe as long as the string isn't pulled with reasonable force, they are explosives so still express caution while doing removing.
 Once you have removed the explosive there are a few ways to detonate it:

By simply pulling the string from the rest of the explosive.
By igniting the explosive directly with fire (instant ignition).
By using a fuse (candle wick works) to lead fire down to the explosive.
 Although it is quieter than most fire crackers, it is still loud and could cause hearing damage., Firmly hold the body of the explosive and the string in the other., The small piece of flint inside should light the gunpowder immediately and there will be a satisfying "bang.",
Remove the wax part from the tin.
Remove the wick and the wick base (you can use later this for the 'Fuse' method).
Optionally, cut back the tin so only a small 'tray' is left.
 Alternatively you can hold it with hand protection on (gloves) but it is more dangerous.
 Don't expect it to work first time, but prepare for it to go off as soon as the flame touches it., Alternatively, for a faster burning fuse but a more dangerous method, dip the cotton string in oil, petroleum jelly, or other flammable substance.
 Let the flame get down to the base part of the explosive and hope for the bang.

 Dry shampoo can do wonders at soaking up any excess olive oil you may have put in your hair. Simply apply the dry shampoo to your dry hair as directed on the package. Most dry shampoos come in spray packages, so spray the product onto your hair and use your brush to comb the product through your hair..Make sure you don’t apply dry shampoo to wet hair.
You can also rub a towel on your hair after you apply the dry shampoo. The added friction should help remove a bit more of the olive oil.
If you don’t have any dry shampoo on hand, you can use a bit of baby powder in a pinch. Just sprinkle a small amount on the crown of your head and use your brush to comb it through your hair.
 Apply a small amount of liquid dishwasher detergent to damp hair if it is still oily. Detergents are designed to strip oils and can get olive oil out of hair after other conditioners and shampoos only remove part of the grease.To avoid drying out hair unnecessarily, start with a small amount of detergent and use more as needed.
Use a deep moisturizing conditioner after applying dishwasher detergent. The detergent can leave hair dry and stripped of all natural oils.
 If you can’t get all of the olive oil out of your hair, try styling your hair into a tight ponytail. This slicked back look will mask some of the greasy residue of the remaining olive oil and buy you a bit more time to try to remove it.You can make a ponytail on the top of your head or one at the back of your neck. You can even make a nice looking low ponytail at the base of your neck.
Additionally, you might consider buns, French braids, or other braids to conceal the greasiness of your hair. These styles are particularly effective for longer hair.

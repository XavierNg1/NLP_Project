 If the search engine you want isn't listed, read on.
 You will see two lists: "Default search settings" and "Other search engines", which are added as you browse sites. You should be able to find any you would like to use here, but if not, scroll down until you see the textbox for adding another search engine.
 This includes the name of the search engine, the search URL, and a keyword. The search engine will then be added. A list of the most common search URLs is available in the Tips section at the end of the article.


If you'd rather not fill out the form data, you can visit the search engine in Chrome and it will be automatically added to the "Other search engines" list.
 The search engine will be added to the "Default search settings" list, as well as the search engine drop-down list in the Settings page.
 If your browser keeps changing your search engine, even after you change it to something else, you may be infected with malware or adware that has hijacked your browser. Click here for instructions on removing it.

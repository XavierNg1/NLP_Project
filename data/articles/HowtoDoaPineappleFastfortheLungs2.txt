 Eat as much of it as you can stomach to start the fast. If you're eating fresh pineapple, aim to eat a whole pineapple in one day. Also: you can eat little else (or nothing else, if you're going gung-ho). So stock up on that pineapple -- when you get hungry enough, you'll want it.


You can prepare it in different ways, but avoid cooking it. That blasts out all the helpful nutrients and enzymes you're looking to put into your body.
Avoid dried pineapple as it is usually covered in sugar.
 However, only eat these additional foods minimally. Pineapple should still be the overwhelming majority of your diet during the fast.


This is only advised by believers of homeopathy.Some physicians will advise sticking to pineapple and pineapple alone.
 Drink laxative tea or take a castor oil supplement on the third day of the fast both in the morning and at night. This will help your digestive tract normalize.


If you are feeling seriously ill, stop. The pineapple fast is not for everyone. Listen to what your body is telling you. If you have to cut it short, do so.
 Wait 6 hours, then eat steamed or raw vegetables. Your body needs to be eased into normal eating habits. Don't cave for that candy bar quite yet!


Add regular foods back into your diet slowly so you don't shock your system. You'll just end up sicker than you ever were at any point during the fast.

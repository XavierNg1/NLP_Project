, Do a search online for these rather than trying to figure them out for yourself or you'll be there for ages (as fun as it is)! For example, turn love to hate with just four letter changes:


LOVE
HOVE
HAVE
HATE.
 Any longer and it gets a bit unwieldy although for a very clever group, that might be a good thing!

, About 10 should suffice for a good round from which you can draw a clear winner.
 Give them their pen and paper. Set the first word for them to change. Tell them something like:


"Change the word LOVE to HATE in as few changes as possible."
You might need to demonstrate this on a whiteboard or piece of paper on the wall first. A good one to use is changing CAT to DOG: CAT -> COT -> DOT -> DOG.
 You could add variations in to the game depending on age, so that players have to rearrange letters or come up with particular acronyms or such.
 You can award the winner as the person who managed to make the most accurate changes (some players won't even manage that much) or to the winner who has the least changes to reach the target word. And it's a very good idea to award a small prize to everyone for trying.

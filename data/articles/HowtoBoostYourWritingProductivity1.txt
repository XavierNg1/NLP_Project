 A writing block can be overcome by a simple change of venue. Productivity increases when you are in a calm and comfortable environment.If your apartment or home is not an environment well-suited to writing consider the following:Try a local coffee shop.
Go to the park or into nature with a lawn chair and your laptop when you need to do some writing.
Play your favorite music to drown out outside noises if you cannot leave your house or apartment.;
, Ask a friend with a home or apartment that has the type of environment that you are looking for if you could spend a few hours each day writing there.Being in a comfortable environment with the company of your friend may increase your productivity. You might even ask your friend to be your work-buddy and to hold you accountable for using your time wisely while you are at his house.
 Staying inside all day to work lowers a personâ€™s productivity. Instead, if you feel unmotivated, wander outside for a walk or to exercise.Being outside in the sunshine helps you relax and relaxation helps to improve the flow of thoughts, productivity, and motivation.
 Sometimes writing from home can be an isolating experience.If you begin to feel isolated, seek out a more public place to write such as a public library or a coffee shop. This will put you in close quarters with other people and will help you feel less isolated as you work.

 To make beeswax lipstick, beeswax should be mixed with butter and oil. The oil you choose affects how your product turns out, so select your oil carefully.Cocoa butter is a good choice as its inexpensive. It also helps add strength to lip balm, making it easier to mold.
Liquid oils, like castor and soybean oil, tend to make a shinier lip gloss.
 Measure out 30 grams of beeswax, 26 grams of butter, and 44 grams of oil. Place them in a saucepan and heat them over the stove until they melt.You can leave the beeswax mixture alone while it melts, but make sure to check it periodically.
 Lip safe micas can be purchased online or at a craft store. Mix these together using the kit the micas come with while your beeswax melts. Place your colors in plastic bags and mix them until they form a paint-like liquid., Take a q-tip and a piece of scrap paper. Test your color by dipping the q-tip in the colors and then making marks with your colors on the scrap paper. Mix small amounts of black or white micas into your colors to lighten and darken them to your liking. Black will make your colors darker while white will make them lighter., Once the wax is melted and you have the colors you want, you can color your beeswax. Use 5 to 10% of your mica color blend to your beeswax base. For example, 10 grams of beeswax would require about .5 grams of mica. Stir in the mica using a spoon., Once your color is mixed in, pour your beeswax mixture to tubes. You can buy tubes for lip gloss online or at a craft store. Fill each tube to the brim with the beeswax mixture. Then, set the tubes aside for a few hours to allow your colorful lip balm to harden.

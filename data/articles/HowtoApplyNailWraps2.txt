 Applying heat to the nail wraps again will help them to adhere to your nails better. It will also give you a chance to smooth out any bumps in the nail wraps. Hold each nail under the hair dryer for about three to five seconds.








Use a cotton swab or an orange tipped cuticle pusher to smooth out any bumps after you apply heat for a few seconds.
 The nail wraps are quite long, so most people will have some excess material at the ends. Use some nail scissors or a nail clipper to cut this excess material off.You do not have to cut it right along the nail, there can be a small amount of nail wrap material hanging over because you will be filing the ends as well.
If you have really short nails, then you might even find it easier to cut off some of the excess strip material before you apply the strips., Next, use a glass file or emery board to file away the edges of the remaining excess nail strip material. File your nails from underneath the nail, not the top of the nail. This will help to prevent jagged edges.
 Finish off your nail wrap manicure by applying a coat of clear nail polish over the top of the nail wraps. You might even want to apply a couple of coats for an extra glossy look.








You can skip the clear nail polish if you like, but the nail wraps may have more of a matte look to them if you skip it.

 Use a deep pot that's large enough to accommodate all your pieces of copper wire. Set the pot on the stovetop and set the heat to high.If you don't have a large pot you can boil your wires in batches.
 Bring the water to a rolling boil. Carefully place your wires into the pot with the plastic casing still attached. The heat will warm up the plastic on the wire and make it easier to remove.Never burn your copper wire casing. It hurts the environment and reduces the value of your wire.
Use thick gloves when handling hot metal.
 Turn off the stove and remove the copper wire from the water using the tongs. Place the wire on a rag or paper towels, but don't let them cool down too much.
 It's important that you don't allow the plastic to cool or else it won't be soft enough to pull apart. Simply grab onto on end of the soft plastic and pull it away from the copper wire. If it's hot enough, it should slide off.

 Before you allow kids to interact with your senior dog, you should explain your dog's needs and set some guidelines. Explain the ways in which the kids can help you to keep them comfortable and safe.You might say, "Two things that really bother Rex are super loud noises and quick movements. What do you think we can do to help him stay comfortable?"
Show them how to touch your dog gently. You might say, "Rex has a lot of pain in his joints, so you have to be careful when you touch him. He only likes to be petted like this."
You might say,"Keep an eye on how Rex is feeling. If he seems unhappy or angry, or if he growls or yelps, give him some space and come let me know."

, Whenever kids are with your senior dog, be sure that at least one adult is around. Even if your senior dog has no history of misbehaving with children, it is best to keep their interactions supervised., One of the best ways to get kids to understand your dogâ€™s needs is to ask for their help with special tasks. The more they get involved in improving your dog's quality of life, the greater understanding they will have of their specific needs.Small kids can help make sure your dog's bed is cozy for naptime.
Older kids can help you build a ramp for your dog to climb stairs.
 Many dogs have been shown to push themselves through physical pain in order to make their owner (or other friends) happy. When it comes to senior dogs, this can lead to real physical damage. Be sure that kids do not overwork your senior dog. Consider setting a time limit on how long they can play.A good rule of thumb is to limit the play time to 30-45 minutes.
This time limit will vary from dog to dog.

 Hold the trout by its dorsal edge and turn it over to expose the belly. You’ll find the exit hole near the tail end of the fish just under the lower fins. Point the blade toward the head, then slide it in smoothly.To dress a fish quickly and efficiently, it’s important to use a sharp filleting knife that offers a little flexibility. This will allow you to make more precise cuts.You’ll be exposed to blood, excrement and other bodily tissues while cleaning trout. It's a good idea to wear rubber gloves to protect you from germs.;
, Run the knife along the length of the fish, stopping just before you reach the head. This cut doesn’t need to be very deep—just apply enough pressure to get through the soft skin on the underbelly without damaging the internal organs.Be extremely careful when handling the knife, as you’ll be cutting in the direction of your opposite hand.
Keeping the organs intact while you open the belly will make them easier to remove later on.
 Hold the trout upright and stick the blade of the knife straight through the jaw beneath the lower “lip.” Keep pushing it until it comes out the other side. The blade should be situated above the tongue but below the jawbone itself.Be sure to start on the side closest to you so you’re moving the blade away from yourself.
Use a slight back and forth motion to help work the blade through the tough skin around the jaw.
 Push the blade forward until it cuts clean through the tissue of the jaw. There should now be a small flap hanging down beneath the mouth of the trout. You’ll use this opening as a fingerhold to strip away the entrails.If you’re working with a knife that doesn’t offer quite as much dexterity, you can also cut partway through the backbone and remove both the head and intestines at the same time.

 Unfold the sheet of newspaper and spread it out on a flat surface. Make sure you have enough room to work.A solid sheet of newspaper makes for a large pirate hat. If you'd like a smaller hat, try cutting off about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from one of the edges., Keep the corners matched up so your hat is nice and even. Run your finger along the fold to make a good crease in your paper.








If you're working with kids, try telling them to fold "hamburger" style to make sure they get the fold right.
 Take the top right corner of the paper and bring it to the center of the newspaper making a triangle. Do the same thing with the other corner.








You should have two triangles now, with the vertical edges lined up in the middle of the paper. For a good hat, try to keep the edges straight. Make good creases when you have everything lined up the way you want it.Add some tape to the triangles if they start to unfold., You should now have a piece of paper that looks roughly like a pirate hat, except for two bottom flaps. Fold one bottom flap up to the bottom edge of the triangles, and tape it down to secure it.








Turn the hat over, and do the same with the remaining bottom flap.
 Your pirate hat is almost finished. The only thing left to do is decorate it. Draw a skull and crossbones on the hat, or print one out and glue it on.You could also draw a skull and crossbones on a piece of poster board. Cut out the design and then glue it on to your hat.

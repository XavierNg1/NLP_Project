 Chemical drain cleaners unclog drains with chemicals such as potassium hydroxide or sulfuric acid.When properly used, they will clear most drain clogs. Choose a type of drain cleaner from your local hardware or discount department store.


Make sure the product is intended for your system; on the back of the cleaner, it will say what types of pipes it is suitable for.
Buy a product intended specifically for bathtubs.
If you are confused about where the cleaners are located or which one to buy, ask an employee for help.
 These are the manufacturerâ€™s instructions, and all drain cleaners will have slightly different ones. Some may require you to wear protective goggles, pour in only a certain amount of liquid, and so on. Reading the instructions on the back is crucial to using the chemical drain cleaner safely.
 You may need to use a bucket or large cup to remove any water remaining in your bathtub.
 Drano, for example, requires you to pour half of a bottle (32 oz) down a clogged drain. On the other hand, Crystal Lye Drain Opener requires you to only pour 1 tablespoon. Be careful to not splash the chemical cleaner as you open the bottle and pour the chemicals into the drain.


Clean up any spills immediately.
Wear gloves at all times when handling any chemicals.
 Many cleaners say 15-30 minutes will suffice, so let the chemicals sit in the drain for this amount of time. Set a timer to accurately keep track of time.
 The drain should be working after you have waited 15-30 minutes. Turn on the cold water faucet in the bathtub, and the water should immediately disappear down the drain.
 Mixing different chemicals can be dangerous, so do not try a different chemical cleaner if the first has not cleared the bathtub drain. At this point, you should call a professional plumber for assistance.

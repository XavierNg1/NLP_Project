 If you wish to make an edible menorah, use frosting instead of the glue. If this is just a decoration project, use glue instead of the frosting.;
, Line up nine of the marshmallows next to each other in a row. Place the tenth marshmallow on top of the stack, in the middle.
 Pick a marshmallow and put a dab of either glue or frosting on the side of it. Place and glue it against another marshmallow. Dab some on the bottom of the tenth marshmallow. It's up to the creator of the menorah if the presentation gets glued on the cardboard or not.
 In a bowl, pour a little amount of milk and a few drops of food coloring. Mix them together to get your "paint". Have a variety of dyed milk colors for kids to choose.
 Gloss each marshmallow and try to avoid poking at them or leaving "skid" marks.
 Slowly and gently, push either pretzel sticks or birthday candles in the middle of each marshmallow.

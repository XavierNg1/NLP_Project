 Any microwave-safe mug or bowl will work fine, but those with circular, flat bottoms work best. You'll end up with an egg in a convenient patty shape, perfect for serving on toast or an English muffin.;
, Dip a paper towel in a little bit of vegetable or olive oil and smear the oil around the inside of the bowl. You could also spray the mug or bowl with non-stick cooking spray. Melting butter into the bowl is another option.
 Be careful so you don't break the yolk.
 Just pour it right on on top of the egg.
 Use a microwave-safe plate or paper towel. This will help prevent any splatters from dirtying your microwave oven.
 Place it in the microwave and cook it on the highest power setting for 35 seconds. When it's done cooking, remove the paper towel and inspect the egg. If the white is still liquid, put it back in the microwave and cook for an additional 10 or 15 seconds. Microwave wattages will vary, so adjust these cooking times as needed based on your microwave's power. When the white is no longer runny, it is done cooking.


This cooking temperature results in a medium-cooked. If you want the yolk to stay runny, cook the egg at 50 percent power for about 60 seconds. Keep cooking until the white is set but the yolk is still runny.For a hard-cooked egg (similar to a hard-boiled egg) cook on the highest power setting for 60 seconds.
 Uncover the bowl and run a knife around the edge of the egg to loosen it. It should slide out easily onto your toast or a plate. Serve the egg as desired.

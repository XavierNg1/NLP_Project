 Occasionally, your infant may wake up when you try to position them. If this happens, consider how long your child has been asleep. If the time is close to the normal length that your child sleeps, and your child seems wide away, let your child stay up until their next nap or bedtime.


If your child still seems tired, or you know that your child has not gotten enough sleep, try to lull your child back to sleep.
 While some children will fall back to sleep as soon as they are placed in their beds, others may need a little help from you. Gently rock your baby in your arms, and sing or hum a calming lullaby.


You could also try placing your child in their bed, and then gently rubbing their tummy to help them fall back to sleep.
 Your child might need you to do something, like change their diaper, in order for them to be more comfortable and fall back to sleep.


Try to do whatever your child needs quickly and quietly so that your child does not think that it is time for them to be awake.
 If your child continues to be fussy, let them stay up. Plan on making their next nap or bedtime a little earlier than normal so that your child does not become overtired and cranky.

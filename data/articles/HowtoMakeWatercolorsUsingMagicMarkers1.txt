 Gather up all of the markers that you plan to use for the watercolors, and separate them according to color. For example, place all of the red markers or all of the blue markers in a pile.This project is ideal for dried out markers. While they may no longer write, there is still plenty of ink inside the inserts for the watercolors.
Brand new markers will also work for the watercolors.
The markers don’t have to be exact color matches when you organize them. For example, you might group together reds, pinks, and burgundies or greens and teals.;
, To get the ink inserts out of the markers, you’ll need to remove the end cap. With some markers, you may be able to simply pull the cap off the end with your fingers. Other markers will require using a pair of pliers to snap off the end of the marker.With some markers, it may be easier to remove the bottom of the marker where the tip that you write with is.
It’s not necessary to remove the ink inserts to make the watercolors. You can simple place the tips of the markers in the water and the ink will leach out. However, the watercolors will not be as pigmented as when you use the inserts.
 Once you’ve removed the end cap, turn the marker upside down. The ink insert, which has a sponge-like texture, should fall right out. Keep them organized by color.The ink inserts may be a little messy, so it’s a good idea to line your work surface with newspaper or foil.

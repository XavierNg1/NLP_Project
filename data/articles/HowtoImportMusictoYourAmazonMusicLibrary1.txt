, You will be directed to the login page. On the login page, just enter your email address and password on the fields provided then press Enter.


If you had signed into your Amazon account at an earlier time, the login page will be skipped, and you will be directed to a page where you can import music.
 On the left-hand side of the page, you’ll see a link labeled “Import Your Music.” Click on this link.
 You can now start importing your music to Amazon by simply clicking either of the two links:



Import all. On clicking this link, all your music on iTunes and Windows Media Player will be imported.

Import selected music. If you just want to import a few select songs, click on the link labeled “Import selected.” Select the songs you want to import then start uploading.
A screen will pop up showing the progress of the songs you are importing. The more songs you have imported, the longer it can take.
You might be prompted to install the Amazon Music Importer if you have never transferred music to your Amazon Music Library. If this is the case, just follow the simple on-screen instructions on the page you’ll be directed to. After installing the Amazon Music Importer, you can “Scan” your files so as to automatically import the songs on iTunes and Windows Media Player. You can also manually select the folders from where the songs is to be imported from.
 Do this by clicking on “Artists” or “Albums” and see if there is any of the new music that you transferred. This action will assure that you have successfully transferred your music.

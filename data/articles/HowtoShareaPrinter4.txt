If your printer has a scanner too, check the "Scanner Sharing" box as well.
 Once sharing is turned on, enable sharing for your printer by opening the "Print & Scan" section of the System Preferences menu. Select the printer you want to share from the list on the left side. If you don't see the printer you want to share, then it may not be installed properly. With the printer selected, click the "Share this printer on the network" option,


If it has a scanner, click the "Share this scanner on the network" option as well.

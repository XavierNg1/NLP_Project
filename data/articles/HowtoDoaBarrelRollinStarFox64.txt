In all versions of Star Fox but the Command version, tap R or Z twice with the joystick or D-Pad in any direction. Do this when you are being shot at be enemies. It does not slow you down, so you could do it just for fun too.



 


In Star Fox: Command, with the stylus, move Right, Left, Right on the Touch Screen or Left, Right, Left.

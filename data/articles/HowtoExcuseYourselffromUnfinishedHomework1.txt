 If your only option seems to be making up a more elaborate excuse—or if you just want to be daring—do so carefully. Many common excuses, like “my dog ate my homework,” are familiar to teachers and they will not believe them. It is difficult to outsmart a teacher who has years of experience working with students and their excuses. Teachers are familiar with many excuses, and can often recognize outlandish ones as untrue. , Turn in the illegible or destroyed assignment, so that you can show your “proof” of your excuse.


Crumple and tear a paper assignment. Then you can tell the teacher that it flew out the window and got run over or trampled on.
Smear dirt and water on your assignment and claim it fell in a puddle.
Spill something dark (like juice or ink) on the assignment so that it is illegible.



For instance, if you have to save work to a USB drive, you can claim to have a problem with the file.
If you are asked to email or otherwise electronically send a homework file, you can “accidentally” send a different assignment, or the “wrong” draft (which could have just your name and the first part of the assignment, for instance). You might even be able to purchase corrupted files. Be aware that your teachers can be tech-savvy and know all of these tricks, so you might have to get creative. ,, For instance, with math work you can write random figures or answers to make it look like you did the work. This might take a lot of time, however, and if your teacher looks closely you might get caught.
 For instance, if you tell your teacher that you forgot your homework in your locker, he or she can just ask you to go and get it, and you will be caught.

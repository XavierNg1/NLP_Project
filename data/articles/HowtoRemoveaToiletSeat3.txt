 Dirtiness and buildup can contribute to the corrosion and degradation of your toilet seat and its hardware. For this reason, you should clean it regularly with a suitable general purpose bathroom cleaner.Check cleaners before using them on toilet porcelain or the seat itself. In many cases, abrasive cleaners should not be used on toilet seats. Check the labels of cleaners to verify their suitability.
 Rubber bushings can be bought at your local hardware store or home center. Slide the circular, rubber bushings up the threading side of the bolt with the tapered side of the bushing facing up at the toilet. Then tighten the nut with the tightening tool that came with the bushings.Many hardware stores will sell this product under a name like "Toilet Seat Tightening/Fastening Kit."

, Seat stabilizers can also be purchased at your local hardware store. Fasten these to seats that wiggle back and forth. The stabilizers should touch the inner rim of the toilet bowl. When the stabilizers are in position, fasten them permanently in place with the screws that came with the stabilizers., Over time, usage can wear out parts or weaken them. Thinness, brittleness, and visible discoloration are good indications that plastic needs to be replaced. Cracked plastic should also be replaced immediately.


Inspect other parts, like the hinges, the fasteners on the bottom of the seat, and the nut on the threaded end of the bolt. Replacing these before they degrade could save you a lot of trouble.

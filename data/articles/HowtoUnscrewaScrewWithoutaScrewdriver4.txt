 Very tiny screws are particularly difficult to remove without the proper tools. They are often found on electronics devices. If you can, use an eyeglass repair kit to remove your screws, which will have the necessary tiny screwdrivers.


If you cannot find or use an eyeglass repair kit then you can try one of these methods.
Eyeglass repair kits are very cheap and easy to find.
 Use the pointed tip of a knife to turn tiny screws counterclockwise. Insert the knife tip into the groove; if you can, try inserting the knife tip at a slight angle to provide more contact surface area between the knife and the screw.
 Use the tip of a metal nail file to insert into the groove on the top of the screw head. Turn the screw counterclockwise, being careful not to damage the head.
 Insert the tip of very pointy scissors into one of the grooves on the screw head. Turn the screw counterclockwise.


Blunt scissors will not work well for opening very small screws.
 Insert the pointy tip of tweezers into the groove on the screw head and turn counterclockwise. The tip of tweezers must be pointy to be inserted into the groove properly.

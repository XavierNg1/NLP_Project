If it is, just wear a baggy/long shirt, or adjust your "pad" to where its not noticeable.



Wear baggy long shirts, or hoodies to cover up, this is also useful if you have a leak too!
Wear baggy pants/shorts. If the pants are too close to your skin, it makes a leak more likely.
Wear an accessory that attracts attention to your face/neck. Like a hat or a necklace. Not a bracelet or a belt though, for that sends attention to your bottom.
Wear dark clothes. A leak will be more noticed on a pair on gray pants than a pair of purple ones.

 You should always lie flat on your back if you have an injury that requires stabilization, as keeping your back flat presents the smallest risk of re-injury. To get out of bed, you will start by bending your knees so that they are pointing toward the ceiling.


As you move, keep your knees and shoulders pointing in the same direction.
 Move slowly and be very careful as you do this to avoid further injury. Roll onto your side by turning toward the outside of your bed. Let your knees slowly fall to the side and use that momentum to turn your body. Be sure to keep your shoulders, hips, and knees facing the same direction. Keep your knees bent as you roll onto your side.


It is sometimes helpful to visualize your body as an actual log. This technique is called a log roll because your torso is supposed to move as one solid unit - just like a log would move.
 You should now be laying on your side, facing outward, with your knees bent. Your bottom arm should be underneath you, and your top arm should be at your side.
 Use your arms for support and move very slowly. Take your top hand and place it flatly on the bed in front of you at chest level. Begin to push your body up while keeping your back straight.
 As your body lifts from the bed, take your bottom hand and place it on the bed underneath your shoulder. You'll use this arm to push up for additional support.
 As you slowly raise your body to a sitting position, move your legs off of the bed, lower them toward the ground, and set your feet on the floor. You should now be in a natural sitting position., If you've been laying down for a long period of time, standing up too quickly may make you feel dizzy or disoriented.

 This is typically the same type of container you would have a fruit basket in or a flower display in. Baskets make a perfect container.;
, Recommended fruits are fresh pineapples, strawberries, honeydew, cantaloupe, grapes, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries.
, Use your flower cookie cutter to cut out flower shaped pieces from each slice. Place pineapple flower pieces on wood skewers with the tips sticking out about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm).
 Cut the balls in half. Place one of the ball halves on the end of the wood skewer that the pineapple flower is on. Randomly place completed flower skewers into the floral foam.
 Place skewers into the floral foam, randomly spaced between the pineapple flowers.
 Place blueberries, grapes, raspberries, or blackberries onto skewers. Place those skewers into the floral foam as well, arranging them between the pineapple and strawberry skewers already in place.
 The parsley can be placed on top of the floral foam to hide it from view.

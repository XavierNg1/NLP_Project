 Dressing up and acting like a caveman can be fun for cosplay or Halloween, but there can be perks in your daily life and wellness, too. Going on a high-protein, high-fiber Paleo diet can help you lose weight and might make you less likely to develop diseases like diabetes, cancer, and heart issues.Eat lots of fresh lean meat and fish, fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, and raw foods
Avoid processed foods (so no packaged or canned food), wheat and other grains, legumes (like peanuts and beans), dairy, refined sugar, and refined vegetable oils (like canola oil).
 In addition to sending your diet back to the Stone Age, make an effort to walk and run more instead of traveling by car. Spend several hours each day outside. Just make sure you’re protected from the elements and not risking your health and safety., Getting away from modern technology and conveniences can help you improve your focus and become more present, even if just for a day or two per week. Putting down the electronics, paying more attention to what you’re eating, and getting more exercise, your brain and body can become more balanced and energized.Set certain days or times aside to live "off the grid" that you won't have to constantly check your smartphone or computer.
Do away with fast food and take time to cook your own meals.

 Don't just take the lens you are going to use. Bring at least 2 or 3 if you can. Give yourself some options.;
, Just because you expected to take pictures of people at the fair, doesn't mean you can't take pictures. Relax and look around.
 You are human after all. Sit down, take a breath, look around.
 Get on your knees, get dirty, and take some pictures.
 That is why you chose photography. That is your ideal medium. Now use it and look photographically.
 Take advantage of being in a (presumably) different location and look around. You just might find your next awesome photo op!

, You would be amazed at how many would love to mug for the camera!

, Do something different. That goes along with getting creative.

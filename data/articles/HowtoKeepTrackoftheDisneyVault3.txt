Make sure websites such as these are bookmarked in your browser.
 For instance, Peter Pan was just released in 2013 for its 60th anniversary. Anticipate that Disney will release certain movies from the vault to celebrate milestone anniversaries such as 10th, 20th, 30th and 50th anniversaries. Sleeping Beauty, for instance, was released in 2014 to celebrate its 55th anniversary.


To track milestone anniversaries, just add the appropriate number to the original release date. Sleeping Beauty, for instance, will celebrate it’s 60th anniversary in 2019. So perhaps it will be released from the vault prematurely; it’s not scheduled to be released until 2023.
In 2006, Disney released Bambi from the vault for 70 days in celebration of it 70th anniversary of when Disney began work on the movie., Take note of Walt Disney’s birthday -- the creator of Disney. His favorite movie, such as Bambi, could be released around his birthday to celebrate. Also, pay attention to current events with actors who performed in Disney movies.


For instance, after Robin Williams’ death, Disney released Aladdin from the vault because Williams played the beloved genie in the movie.

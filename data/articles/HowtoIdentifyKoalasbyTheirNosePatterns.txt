 The best identification photos are taken from front-on and slightly below the koala. The focus should be on the nostrils, in good light (not too much shadow or contrast).;
, This is the 'target area' where the nose pattern exists. See the area inside the pink outline in the image. Markings outside of the target area can vary throughout the life of the koala, so should be noted, but should not be relied upon for identification.
 Look just at the target area - can you see the differences?

, Truganina on the left has a lot more white in her nose pattern. The white extends outside the nostril area in a few places. Her lips have a lot of white too. There are black spots in the white. Pat, on right, has a simpler nose pattern. The white is almost totally confined inside the nostrils.
 There are three ways you can record nose patterns. Use just one, or two in combination, whatever works for you.
 Compare each new koala photograph to the existing photographs until you achieve a match by eye. These two photographs above are of the same koala, Truganina, 5 years apart. Can you see the match? This method works if you can see the match easily, and if there's not a lot of koalas to choose from. It will help if you file carefully, and keep a record of each koala seen (see Tips below on how to do this)

, This method is perfectly valid, quick and easy especially if you're not computer savvy, or don't have a lot of time. Take a photocopy or scan of your diagram, keep it handy in a binder to check against future photographs of the same koala.
 This method is useful if there are several people using the method on the same koalas, or if you are not confident of making the comparison by eye. Simple programs are fine - like Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro. Powerful programs like GIMP are good too. The image above shows two nose pattern diagrams, created with GIMP, of the same koala nearly 5 years apart. Pink layer = December 2013, blue layer = February 2008

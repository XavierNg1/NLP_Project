 Feeling like the best ranch around? Grab a tall glass jar and your immersion blender and get to work. To make you own mayo:


Crack 1 room-temperature egg into the bottom of the jar
Add 1 cup flavorful oil, usually avocado oil (olive will work also, but may have a stronger taste)
Work your immersion blender into the mixture until you have a whipped, creamy texture.
Continue making ranch like normal., There are a lot of different ways to create that creamy base, and you should play around with the options you like best. Chefs all have their favorite ratios, and you should try out:


6 tablespoons sour cream, 4-5 tablespoons mayo, 1 cup buttermilk1/2 cup sour cream, 1 cup mayo, 1/2 - 1 cup buttermilk1 cup whole milk, 1-1/2 cup sour cream, 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice

, While the basics of garlic, salt, pepper, and herbs will do, many chefs want a bit more variety when cooking. Some other spices to consider include:


Smoked paprika
Cayenne (for a little spicy kick)
Oregano
Mustard powder
MSG, also sold as "powdered Umami"
Finely grated Parmesan cheese

, You can add them with the dry ingredients for a stronger flavor, or just top the dressing with these aromatic herbs. Finally chopped fresh greens will give a refreshing burst of flavor to the dressing., If you like a lighter, thinner ranch dressing, add a little more liquid in. This can be buttermilk, plain milk, or even a touch of water. For the adventurous chef, you could even try out a few more flavorful additions:


White Vinegar, giving a bitter, tangy edge to the dressing
Worcestershire Sauce, with a bit of bite
Tabasco Sauce, to add some heat to the mix.

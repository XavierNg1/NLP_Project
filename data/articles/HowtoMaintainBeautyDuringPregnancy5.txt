There are many chemicals in hair dyes, but studies have not proved a direct link with birth defects. However, waiting until the second or third trimester will reduce exposure when the baby's vital organs are developing.
To be even safer, consider highlights. Unlike a single-process color, dye isn't applied to the scalp, reducing the likelihood of the chemicals entering your system.



Polish can contain trace amounts of chemicals, but they aren't absorbed through the skin around your nails and haven't been linked to pregnancy complications.



Be mindful that your skin is more sensitive during pregnancy. You'll also need to be propped up in your chair when getting a facial during the third trimester. Lying flat on your back can affect your circulation and balance.



If you haven't had a bikini wax before, wait until after labor. The pain of the treatment may prompt contractions. Also, be aware that you may experience more skin irritation post wax during pregnancy.



The effects of teeth-whitening procedures have not been fully studied and teeth are extra sensitive during pregnancy. Hot tubs, steam rooms, saunas and tanning beds can raise the body's core temperature and affect your balance.

 Basset Hounds' ears are perhaps their most recognizable physical feature. They are very large and long enough to nearly touch the ground when the dog is tracing a scent. The size helps these large ears serve a purpose: they effectively sweep scent forward towards the dog's nose.If your gently draw an ear forward, it will easily fold over the front of a Basset Hound's nose. Their ears will also be velvety to the touch.
Since the ears are set very low on a Basset Hound's head, they may look as though they are growing out of the dog's neck, especially when the dog is sitting down.
Even as puppies, Basset Hounds will have very large ears. This feature is so prominent that it can help identify a Basset Hound puppy without seeing the dog's parents.;
, The head of a Basset Hound is larger and well-proportioned to its shoulders and body. Its skull will be longer than it is wide. Most Basset Hound skulls will have a visible dome and noticeable bump on the back. The muzzle will be about equal in length to the rest of the skull.When you look at the dog’s head from the side, the top of the skull and the muzzle will both be flat and on parallel planes.
 Basset Hound noses are darkly colored, and they have wide nostrils that seem to be held open. The lips are also darkly colored, and hang heavily from the dog’s mouth. Overbites and underbites are relatively uncommon in this breed. A Basset Hound’s sunken brown eyes are also especially recognizable, and will likely strike you as soft and sad., Basset Hounds have heavy, loose, and elastic skin, especially on their heads. Watch when the dog lowers its head to the ground; distinct wrinkles will show above its eyes. The dewlap, or the flap of skin hanging lengthwise beneath the dog’s head and neck, will be very prominent.

 A scarf around your head is kind of like a custom hood. It will keep your hair out of your face and look similar to a veil. However, it will have a more casual, somewhat bohemian vibe than a traditional wedding veil.Scarves can be a way to add a splash of color to your look. If you're still searching for that something blue, for example, add it using your veil.
 If you don't mind veering fairly far off from the traditional, try a hat. Many bridal stores sell bridal hats, which can range from small and subtle to big and ornate. With some searching, it's easy to find a hat that fits your wedding's theme.If you're doing a very specific theme, a hat can be a great veil alternative. For example, wear a cowboy hat if you're doing a western-themed wedding. If you're doing a Southern-themed wedding, opt for a traditional wide-brimmed Southern bell hat.
 A headband can be a fun option for a more casual wedding. It keeps your hair back, as a veil, but is not as dressy. Headbands can also add a splash of color to your wedding ensemble.You can use a colorful headband to hold your hair out of your face at your wedding.
You can also tie your hair back using a headband.

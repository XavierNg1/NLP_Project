 Rotate clockwise if your top hand is your left hand, or counterclockwise if it is your right. Keep rotating until the back of your top hand is almost facing the same direction as the back of your bottom hand.

If holding the flat side of the bat towards the ground, the ‘V’ formed by the thumb and forefinger of your top hand should now right side up – i.e. the ‘V’ should open upwards.
 This grip was developed by Alan Knott to deal with fast bowling and high rising balls. It allows for an extremely fast, short swing, perfect for cutting the ball.Fast bowling – Fast bowlers specialize in bowling the ball fast, as opposed to generating spin. Bowling over 87mph (140kmph) is generally considered fast bowling. The fastest bowlers can throw the ball over 96 mph (154 km/h) (155kmph).Short bowling – In cricket, the ball is usually bounced before it reaches the batter. Fast bowlers often bounce the ball well short of the batter, so that it rises to chest or head height as it reaches them. A quick bat helps the batsman to hit shots at waist to shoulder height., Because this grip limits the extension of your arms, it also limits the ability to create power. It is best for working singles or twos (the two batsmen run to each other’s end of the pitch one or two times) as opposed to hitting boundaries (the ball is hit out of the field of play).

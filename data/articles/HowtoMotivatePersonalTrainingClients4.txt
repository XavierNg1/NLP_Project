 If you’re constantly excited, passionate, and encouraging in front of your clients, it will rub off on them. Refrain from saying anything negative- even if you agree with your client that working out the triceps is super boring, don’t tell them that! Act like everything about exercise is fun, and they might just start to feel that way.Even if you’re disappointed that they didn’t hit a goal or finish an assignment, stay focused on the positive. Rather than berating them or allowing them to dwell on a failure, remind them that they have a new day, week, and month to accomplish their goals. The past is the past!

, If you were once overweight, out of shape, or gym-phobic, tell them that! If you have struggled to find time for workouts or to beat cravings, let them know. By finding similarities with your client, you can show them that you’re human, just like them, and their goals are possible. If they see your lifestyle, physique, or mindset as an unattainable goal for them, they can easily lose motivation. Make yourself as relatable as possible., As a personal trainer, you are your own best advertisement. Your body is proof that your techniques work. Don’t give your client instructions that you yourself couldn’t follow. Your clients will find motivation by seeing you work hard, with positivity, determination, and consistency. You’ll lose credibility if you talk the talk but don’t walk the walk, and there is nothing motivating about that.

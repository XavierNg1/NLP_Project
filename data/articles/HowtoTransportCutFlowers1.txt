 You can keep your flowers in the fridge before your event or at a venue to keep them fresh longer.


If you do this, make sure the temperature of the fridge is cool but not close to freezing.
Also, be sure to remove any fruits or vegetables from the refrigerator, as they emit a gas called ethylene that can harm your cut flowers.;
,


When you cut the flower stems, do so while they are submerged in water. You can fill up a shallow basin of water for this purpose. Cutting them in water ensures no air gets into the stem.
Use very sharp shears or scissors to avoid pinching the stem instead of slicing it neatly.
You want to cut each stem at around a 45-degree angle.
 You want your stems to be free from leaves that don’t serve a purpose in your arrangement.You want to trim these leaves because leaves that stay damp could rot and cause mold or bacteria to grow around the base of your arrangement.
 If your flowers are already arranged, you can wrap rubber bands around each arrangement. If they aren’t, you can simply wrap according to flower type.


The rubber bands just keep your flowers in manageable bundles as your transport them and assure you don’t lose any of the arranging you’ve already done.
 You want to use a material that will hold the water for a long period of time.


If you want, you can add a small amount of a floral preservative to the water that you soak your cotton wool in.
 You can use any kind of plastic wrap or plastic bag for this to seal in moisture and keep your flowers in place.


Once you’ve wrapped around the cotton wool with plastic wrap, secure over it with a rubber band.

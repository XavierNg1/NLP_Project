 Folding a perfect octagon from a sheet of paper means starting with a square sheet. Note that most types of paper used for daily tasks related to work and/or school are rectangular, rather than square. For instance, ordinary printer paper is usually 8 1/2 x 11 inches (21.59 x 27.94 cm). This means you'll need to find a square sheet of paper (construction paper often comes in this shape) or trim one edge of your paper to make it square.


If you're trimming your paper, use a ruler to ensure accuracy. For instance, if you want to trim an 8 1/2 x 11 piece of paper into a square, you would use a ruler to measure 8 1/2 inches on the 11 inch side of the paper, then cut.
 Notice that, as you do this, you create an 8-sided shape. These folds will serve as four of the eight sides of your octagon, so, for your octagon to appear regular, it's important to ensure they're the correct size. Use a ruler to measure the folded edges - you'll want any two edges to be as close to the size of the space between them as possible.


Note that you shouldn't fold the corners all the way in. If you do, you'll be left with a smaller square. Instead, fold the corners in about halfway to the center.
 When you're happy with the dimensions of your octagon, partially unfold the corners of the piece of paper and cut along the folded edges. You should be left with an eight-sided shape with sides that are all roughly the same length - a regular octagon.

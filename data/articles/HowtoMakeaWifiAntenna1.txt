 In order to make the antenna, you will need a large paper clip, an empty Bic ballpoint pen, and a roll of electrical tape. You will also need a metric ruler, scissors, and a lighter.;
, Unfold the paper clip into straight piece of metal.
 In order to get the best signal, your paper clip should be 61 mm long. Try to get as close to this measurement as possible for the most effective antenna.
 Bend about 19 mm (3/4 inch) of one end of the paper clip at a 90Â° angle. This will be the part that inserts into the WiFi antenna port.
 Since you're going to be clipping the ink cartridge, it's best if you use a pen that doesn't write anymore. Clip off about 12-18 mm (1/2 inch to 3/4 inch) of the tubing that contains the ink. This can get messy, so be sure to hold the tube away from you when you cut. Cut the tube over a surface that you don't getting stained.
 Place the cut-off piece of tubing over the bent end of the paper clip. Make sure that the tubing extends past the end of the paper clip by about 1.5 mm (1/16 inch).
 Take a lighter or other heat source and GENTLY heat the tubing on the paper clip. This will shrink the tubing and make a tight fit to the paper clip.
 Wrap the paper clip in electrical tape to prevent excess interference with the wireless signal.
 Insert the 'tubing' end of the paper clip into the antenna connector, ensuring that the connector pin and the paper clip are pressed together inside the tubing. If you can get them to overlap the signal will be even better.

 Once you’ve immediately attended to the beetroot stain with cold water, pre-treat the stain with a laundry stain spray or apply a small amount of undiluted detergent to the area. Allow this to sit for several minutes., After allowing the laundry stain treatment to set, rinse the stain using cold water. Gently massage the stain with your fingers to encourage it to lift off as the pre-treatment washes away.

If the stain is gone after the pre-treatment, wash the garment in accordance to its care instructions.
 Check the care label of your garment to see if the garment can tolerate chlorine bleach or if a color safe chlorine detergent is required. Soak your garment in a chlorine-based bleach or detergent for 15 minutes using cold water.Only use bleach on white items. Otherwise, you might bleach the stain and the colored fabric!
Oxygen-based bleach or detergent is not as effective on beetroot stains, but it can be used instead of chlorine-based bleach and detergent.
Soak your garment overnight in oxygen-based bleach or detergent for best results.
 After you’ve let it soak, put your garment in the washing machine with a chlorine-based bleach or detergent and wash according to the care instructions., If the stain is gone, it’s safe to put the garment in the dryer. If the stain isn’t gone, put it through another wash cycle with chlorine-based bleach or detergent.Be sure the stain is gone before putting the fabric in the dryer. Drying a stained garment will cause the stain to set permanently.

 To do this, you can curve a magazine and stuff some newspaper into the back of it. Once curved into a long semi-circle it can be taped to keep the shape. Alternatively, you can use a PVC pipe cut in half lengthwise. Each will allow a good mold for the mask. Once you have this shape (to avoid the clay sticking to it) insert it into a plastic bag. Put this to the side as you will need it later.;
, Put the clay on a piece of canvas and then roll it out to ¼” thick. This is best achieved by using a rolling kit which has slats to show the thickness.  or you can use and a rolling pin and wooden paint sticks. The amount of clay needed will depend on the size and decorative features of the mask you intend to make.
 You can use a lace doily or similar and continue to roll the clay with the rolling pin while still using the slats. This will leave a good imprint onto the clay.
 Use a skewer to cut around the clay to get the shape and then place the mask on the structural form you made earlier.
 To add volume to the features use small pieces of clay and roll and shape them into parts to form a nose, eyebrows, eyes or a lips.


Once shaped the pieces can be attached to the mask by dampening, with a little water, and brushing this onto both sides of the clay. Press the new features into the clay to make sure they are stick together well.
Alternatively use small pieces of clay to form shapes like a snake or use a cookie cutter to cut out any shape you like or perhaps even simply scratch some lines into the mask clay. Additional pieces can be attached as before with brushing a little water onto the clay.
 Once the clay is dry you can then add string or wire to the mask.
 If you wish to press any decorations, such as beads or jewels,  into the clay now is the time to do this.
 Place a plastic bag placed loosely over top of it.

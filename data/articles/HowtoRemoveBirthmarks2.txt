 Lemon juice contains ingredients that can naturally lighten the skin. However, the efficacy of lemon juice in treating birthmarks has not been scientifically confirmed and thus, you should use this method with reservations.Apply fresh lemon juice on the birthmark for 20 minutes and rinse off. Repeat several times a week.
Do not use if the lemon juice causes skin irritation.
Keep in mind that you will probably have to repeat this treatment (or any home remedy) many times over many months to see an improvement. You may be better off speaking with a dermatologist about medical treatment options if you want to remove a birthmark.
 Iodine may help fade birthmarks but again, this method has not been scientifically proven. Apply iodine solution over the spot twice daily.However, remember that iodine solution is a medical product and should be used with caution. Also, avoid using this treatment if you have an allergy to iodine or shell fish.
Do not use if any irritation occurs and consult your doctor if you have any concerns.
 Olive oil is a powerful natural moisturizer that can restore skin and make birthmarks appear softer and smoother. Apply olive oil at least three times over the spot, leave on to dry or rinse off.Use a cotton ball to apply the oil directly onto the birthmark 2 to 3 times a day.
 Tomato juice has skin bleaching properties and may help fade birthmarks. Apply slightly warm tomato juice on the spot and let it air-dry. Repeat a few times a day for a month.Make sure that the tomato juice is not too hot or you may burn your skin.
 Vitamin A stimulates mitotic activity (cell division) and the production of collagen (the protein that builds the skin). Although vitamin A creams (often called Retinol) are used to treat hyperpigmentation, their efficacy in lightening birthmarks is not known., The antioxidant properties of vitamin E may help with birthmarks. Mix vitamin E oil with orange oil and apply over the birthmark.

 People yawn more often in warm places than in cold. Scientists believe that's because yawning floods the body with cooler air and helps to cool down the brain when it's on the verge of getting overheated. Studies show that people yawn less often in winter or in rooms that are kept cold.On the reverse side, if you're trying to get some work done and you can't stop yawning, try turning down the temperature to cool the room down a bit. Your yawns should subside pretty quickly.
 We tend to yawn more in the morning because our brains are a little hotter during the night. Yawning cools us down when we wake up. If you want to make yourself yawn, try getting back in bed, getting under the covers and warming yourself up. You'll be yawning before you know it.
 Stress and anxiety cause the brain's temperature to rise, and yawning cools it back down. That's why Olympic athletes have been observed yawning right before competing. Skydivers and other daredevils also yawn right before they take the plunge. Working yourself up into a frenzy may help stimulate some yawning to cool your brain down.

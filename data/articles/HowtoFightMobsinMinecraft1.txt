 Get some iron or higher armor, too. A bow with arrows is optional (recommended), and maybe a couple of dogs as a backup. Also, grab some torches.

If possible, get your equipment enchanted. Don't forget to bring a shield. Be careful not to take all of your good items, because if you die, it will be hard to retrieve them unless you have keep inventory on, which is often considered cheating. Also in the 1.9 update, you can dual wield a bow and sword, so you can shoot and use melee attacks almost at the same time.
 Aggressive mobs can't spawn in Peaceful mode (if you want a challenge, set to Hard). Put your weapons, food, and potions in your hotbar, and place some torches around you to add light.


It is recommended to sort items. For instance, weapons on one side and potions, food, etc. on the other.
 Jump and swing or sprint and hit. Critical damage comes as you fall. Try to time your swing to hit the mob as you fall after the jump.

 To help your child become confident and ultimately independent, you should focus on their strengths. Pay attention to the activities that they enjoy and help them find a way to incorporate these activities into their life. This can help to raise their self-esteem.For example, your child may excel at organized sports. Make sure they get an opportunity to take part in sports either through school programs or extracurriculars.
 When you praise your child’s accomplishments, you should always focus on rewarding their efforts rather than just the outcome. This way you are communicating to them that hard work and effort are more important than the actual results. It also helps them work towards goals. If your child understands that hard work is rewarded, they will be more likely to become independent and take on challenging tasks.Instead of saying “I am so proud because you got an A on your math assignment,” say “I’m proud of you for practicing your math problems. You are really sticking with it.”

, You can build self-confidence in your child by accepting them for who they are. Every child has their own unique personality. Embrace their difference and make them feel completely comfortable in their skin. Avoid being overly critical. This will give them the confidence they need to feel sure of themselves and will make it easier for them to become independent as they grow older.

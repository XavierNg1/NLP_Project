 The main part of a Range/2h pure is being able to get a KO with your 2h of choice. You are going to want as high strength level as you can, level 99 would be the best, of course, but level up to your choice. While doing this, train attack and defence to level 40 as well, so you can wield your weapon and wear armor.
 With a name like range/2h pure, it makes sense that range levels would be needed to pk with one. The point to training this is to get in intermediary hits doing damage so you are able to get your opponent down low enough to hit him with your 2h and Kill them. Again 99 is recommended but train to your liking., You are going to be buying a lot of supplies, from food to gear, so you are going to need as much money as you can get. Depending on your gear, anywhere from a few hundred thousand to a few million can be enough to buy your supplies., Buy a Magic shortbow, about 100 rune arrows, full green dragon hide, a rune two-hander, an amulet of strength, super range and strength potions is you are member, range and strength potions if you are not, and finally food. If you are a member, buy sharks, if you are free-to-play, buy swordfish., Preferably someone your level, and even better, a range 2h pure like yourself. When you find the fight, drink your potions and start attacking them with your magic shortbow. You can use your special attack if you wish, as you will not be using it with your 2h., Once you think your opponent is low enough switch to your 2h. Ideally, you want to switch to your 2h immediately after the animation of shooting the arrow from your magic shortbow starts is when you want to switch, as you will get a hit in with the bow and 2h in the same tick. If you did not kill them, switch back to your shortbow. If you did, loot your kill and get out of there.

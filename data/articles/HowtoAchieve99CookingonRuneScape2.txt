 Since bonfires were added to the game, they offer great bonus experience into the game. The most common place to find bonfires is world 100 at Shantay Pass, just south of the Al-Kharid Lodestone. Here you can find several dozen people using food on bonfires, and giving you bonus experience.
 You get an unpowered set of gauntlets after completing the Family Crest Quest. You can then bring them Caleb in Gertrude's house just west of Varrock to change them to cooking gauntlets. These lower your chance of burning fish from swordfish on up.
 Cook shrimp. In the beginning, you will burn a lot, however you'll notice you'll burn very few near the end.
 Cook trout. These are very cheap to buy, as people who fly fish at Gunnar's ground and Shilo Village get several thousands of them, so you won't be spending much cooking them.
 Cook Salmon. These are again fished very commonly by fly fishers, and the demand for cooked salmon is decent food for free to players.
 Cook Tuna. Tuna is the ingredient used in Tuna Potatoes, and therefore is very sought after by people looking to monopolize the pker market. The reason you cook to 68 is that is the level you can cook the next fish without burning them.
 Cook lobsters. At this level, you should burn very few, if any lobsters. These are again sought by pkers as they are very good food in the f2p worlds.
 Cook Monkfish. You stop burning monkfish at level 82, so you will be making pure profit, as they are used by PvMers and early slayer accounts, as they heal 1600 for a cheap price.
 Cook Sharks. If you are wearing your cooking gauntlets, you won't burn these either, and they are used in most pvp situations, as well as several bosses use them for the pvm dungeon.
 Cook rocktail. Rocktail are the highest healing food in the game, aside from rocktail soup, and therefore are used in almost every situation from pking to slaying. You can make a tidy profit if you don't burn too many.

 For those who don't know what this product is, tinted moisturizer is basically a mix of foundation and moisturizer. You can also use a cream stick concealer close to your skin tone, however, make sure that the cream stick concealer is the right colour! If it's too light it will draw attention to the area you put it on, but if it's to dark than it makes your face look dirty and unnatural.;
, It evens out your skin tone and reduces red spots and blotches.

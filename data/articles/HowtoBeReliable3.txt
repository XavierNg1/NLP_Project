 Leave your personal anger, sadness, difficulties and feelings about illness or dysfunctional, exciting/disturbing or controlling family or friends outside. Leave emotions (yours and theirs) at home. Smile, when/if that is appropriate.
 Keep fun activities of family and friends from preoccupying your mind during intensive work: and so, keep it from interfering in the planning, expediting, routing, production, deadlines, setting the company or school better/best mindset, and out of the secretarial, and assistant management team and off the sport team, to be keenly aware of any ongoing processes, etc.
 So, be at the top of your game and work: relax and sleep well to be able to be at your best. Cope with the effects of jet-lag (disruption of hours of sleeping and being awake). Shift your eating and going to bed earlier a few nights before leaving -- if you're traveling east, but if you're traveling west, try eating and going to bed later for a couple of nights before departing. Stay well hydrated.
 Be sure that you are not just going through the motions, and work on having calm nerves that are able to match your designated tasks. Capacities and abilities should be honed to be confident and then relax your muscles, as desirable, and assure yourself that you are well prepared.
 First you must have that experience and then use it to keep worrying reversed by replacing it with that image or thought.

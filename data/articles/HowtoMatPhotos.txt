 You can customize photo mats to any measurement specifications you want. However, if you want to frame the matted photo, you may want to cut the mat's outer perimeter to fit a standard-size frame. If you choose to mat a photograph with a unique-size mat, you will need a custom frame.;
, Use a ruler to draw straight lines on the mat board to dimensions of your mat's outer perimeter. Cut the board using a mat cutter or razor knife.
 Do this on the backside of the mat board. Make the opening 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) smaller than your photo, to ensure that the photo's edges are covered.

Use a T-square to make sure your frame edges are straight. Trace the edges of the square at each corner, then connect the lines using the straight edge of the T-square or a ruler.






You can center the frame opening, or locate the photo at the top, bottom or one of the sides of the mat. Leave more edging on one side for artistic effect, or to make room for a caption or title tag.
 Use a ruler as a guide and slowly cut through the mat board with a razor knife or mat cutter, making sure to completely penetrate the mat. Place a scrap piece of mat or cardboard under the mat so you don't cut the surface you are working on.
 Lay the mat upside down on a flat surface. Lay your photo upside down on top of the mat so that the image is centered over the open space. Tape the photo to the mat with clear adhesive tape.


Use as little tape as possible on the photo. To much tape will ripple the photo in the frame.
 Place pieces of double-sided tape at the corners on the back of the mounted photo. Press the mat down on top of the mounting board to ensure the tape adheres.


If you want to display a matted photo in a frame, you do not need a mounting board.

 It's always a pretty good idea to start your collections on games you already know you would or most likely enjoy.;
, It would be more difficult to find games for different consoles all over the place. So to save time I would recommend focusing on one console at a time unless if you know exactly which games you were planning to buy.
 Such as Resident Evil, Final Fantasy, Grand Theft Auto, Gran Turismo, Silent Hill, God of War, Legend of Zelda, Assassin's creed, Mortal Kombat, Star Wars, Etc. Those games series are very popular at the moment and would look great on any games collection.

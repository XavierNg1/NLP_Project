 Males are far more likely than females to consider sarcasm as a form of lighthearted humor. If your feelings are hurt by sarcasm, consider whether or not the intentions were really unkind. Some people just use sarcasm as a habit. Most often they don't think about how it effects others.Think about other things the person has said or done and how they made you feel.
If the majority of actions were kind, it’s possible that the person just as a different sense of humor than you do. Their words may have come out different then they intended.
 Sarcasm can be a form of anger, or just a go-to on how to deal with life. Sometimes sarcastic people is resentful, angry or bitter about perceived slights he or she's received, whether at home or in the workplace. These slights may have come from you, but they’re just as likely to have come from someplace else altogether.Because some of us handle trials in life by taking it head on, crying, pushing the problem away, etc. But deep down, most sarcastic people are afraid. They don't know how to deal with life, so their go-to is sarcasm. That is how they cope.


The impulse behind sarcasm is sometimes to help the person using it, feel better. Maybe they just like to make people laugh, or they could be trying to hurt someone so that they can have more power.
It’s a dysfunctional communication that can injure others feelings, and does less to help the sarcastic person then what they want. It’s quite common.
 If a person lives in a social environment in which sarcasm is a common method of communicating anger, he or she might not even realize that he/she's using it with others. Even if he/she is aware, it’s a hard habit to break.If the person wants to try to learn better patterns of communication, talking to a counselor or therapist can be helpful.
Even if it’s a habitual response, there is a time and a place for sarcastic behavior, but sometimes people who use sarcasm doesn't know the right time.

 An improper fraction is a fraction that has a larger numerator than denominator.For example, 104{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{4}}} is an improper fraction, because ten is greater than 4.
;
, The denominator is the number below the fraction bar. It tells you how many equal pieces a whole is divided into.

For example, in the fraction 104{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{4}}}, 4 is the denominator, and it tells you that a whole is divided into four equal parts, or quarters.
 The numerator is the number above the fraction bar. It tells you how many pieces you have.

For example, in the fraction 104{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{4}}}, 10 is the numerator, and it tells you that you have 10 parts, or 10 quarters.
 Divide each whole according to the denominator of your fraction.

For example, if your denominator is 4, then divide each circle you draw into 4 equal pieces, or quarters.
 The number in the numerator tells you how many pieces you should shade in.

For example, if your fraction is 104{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{4}}}, you will shade in 10 quarters.
 To simplify an improper fraction, you must turn it into a mixed number, which includes a whole number and a fraction together. The number of whole circles you shaded in represents the whole number of your mixed fraction. Write this number down.

For example, for the fraction 104{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{4}}}, you should have shaded in 2 whole circles, so the whole number of your mixed number will be 2.
 The leftover shaded parts will represent the fraction in your mixed number. Write this fraction next to your whole number, and you have your mixed number.

For the fraction 104{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{4}}}, you should have shaded in 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}} of a circle, so the fraction part of your mixed number will be 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}}. So 104{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{4}}} is equal to 224{\displaystyle 2{\frac {2}{4}}}.
 Sometimes the fraction of your mixed number will need to be reduced before you reach your final, simplified answer.For example, if your mixed number is 224{\displaystyle 2{\frac {2}{4}}}, you could simplify it to 212{\displaystyle 2{\frac {1}{2}}}

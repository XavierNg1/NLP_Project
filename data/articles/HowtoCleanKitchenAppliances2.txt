 Cut a lemon in half. Place both halves cut-side down on a microwaveable plate with a tablespoon of water. Microwave for about 1 minute or until the lemon is hot and the inside of the microwave is steamy. Wipe the inside of the microwave with kitchen paper and wash the plate. Now that the lemon is hot and squishy, it makes a great natural cleanser for a smelly garbage disposal. Cut the halves into smaller pieces and flush through with plenty of water.
 Slice a lemon in half and place it in the microwave on high for 30 seconds. Firmly rub the inside of the lemon over your kitchen appliances in a circular motion - microwaves, ovens, fridges whatever you have that harbors grease and grime. Heat the other half of the lemon and continue if necessary. Wipe down with a clean kitchen towel and be amazed as all the grease pulls away effortlessly.
 Use fresh citrus juice on chrome items in the kitchen, to remove scale build-up. Squeeze the juice out, then either wipe or spray it onto the chrome item.
 Lemons can be used to remove odors from plastic containers and garbage disposal units.


For a garbage disposal unit: Throw finished peel and lemon halves/quarters into the unit. Turn the unit on to grind the lemon pieces. This is a great way to get rid of the peel or old lemons, as it will leave a fantastic odor behind.
For plastic containers, squeeze lemon juice into soap water and fill the container. Allow to soak for half an hour or so, then scrub lightly. Pour out and allow to dry. The odor should be gone. Let sit for 10 minutes, then rinse off. Any scale build-up should come off with it.

 Some optometrists feature frames in their office. They may fit your lenses in these for free or at a discounted rate. Before shopping around, you should know if their rate for bringing in an outside pair of frames will put the glasses out of your price range.
 It seems that the best prices will be at specialty or discount frames shops. However, you may find that the difference between these shops and your optometrist is negligible. After the fee for fitting your lens, warranties, and other considerations, you may be better off picking frames from your optometrist.


If you only use your glasses minimally and at home, you may not feel the need to have a big insurance plan. Determine if you need to be able to get your frames repaired for free when comparing costs.
 There may be specialty frame shops that sell products much different than those offered by your optometrist. They may also be discounted enough that it vastly outweighs the benefits of picking a pair in your optometrist’s office. Don’t limit yourself to the prices and stock of one shop when picking out new frames.

 The Big Dipper is comprised of seven of the sky’s brightest stars, and is found either high or low in the northern sky, depending on the season. It also rotates around the North Star, which is why it’s important when you’re trying to find your direction in the Northern Hemisphere. As long as you’re located no lower than 23.5 degrees north latitude, the constellation is always above the horizon. Four of the stars form the Big Dipper’s bowl, while the other three form a handle.The phrase “spring up and fall down” can help you figure out where to look in the sky for the Big Dipper based on the seasons. In the spring and summer, it’s located high in the sky. On fall and winter nights, you’ll find it lower in the sky, closer to the horizon.;
, Regardless of the season, the two stars that form the outer edge of the Big Dipper’s bowl always point toward the North Star. If you draw an imaginary line from the pointer stars across the sky to the next brightest star, you’ll find the North Star.If you’re having trouble finding the North Star, stretch your arm out completely and spread your fingers. The distance between the the top pointer star and the North Star should be about the same distance as your thumb is from your middle finger.
 Unlike the stars in the Big Dipper constellation, the North Star is always located at fixed point in the sky, which leaves it never more than 1 degree from true north. That means when you’ve identified the North Star in the sky, you know that you’re facing north. From that position, the opposite direction would be south, while east would be to your right and west would be to the left.Using the North Star to find your direction works best on a clear night. If the sky is hazy or there are clouds, you may not be able to easily identify the Big Dipper.
If you’re in an area where mountains, trees, or other objects are blocking the night sky, you may not be able to use the North Star to find your direction either.

 Avoid choosing vintage clothes that look frumpy just for the sake of having something vintage.
 For instance, mary jane from the 1950s are a lot trendier and easier on the eyes than neon leg warmers from the 1980s, and a classic shirt-dress is much easier to modernize than a corseted Victorian bustle gown.
 Decide which elements you like from each decade and determine which decades appeal most to you.
 For example, mix rough tweed with smooth chiffon or corduroy or fur with lace. The more dramatic the contrast, the trendier it will look.

 Open a web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Internet Explorer. Navigate to the Microsoft account creation page.;
, Filling out the form should only take a few minutes, and it is only basic information (First/Last Name, Country, Zip, Birthdate, Gender). However, a phone number or current valid email address will be required in order to finish the account creation.
 After you are done filling in the form, click the blue “Create account” button at the bottom of the page.
 Once the new account has been created, you should be taken to a profile management page. From this page, you can add information like Basic information, Payment information, and Security information. You can even add a profile picture by clicking the blue circle that says “Add a picture.”


If you are happy with just having an account, without adding more information, then you are already done. Enjoy your new Microsoft account.

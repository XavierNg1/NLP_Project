 You will see 2 links at the top, 1 that says "Sign in" and another that says "register."


Click on the "Sign in" link and provide your username and password to log in if you already have an eBay account.
Use the "register" link to fill out the registration form if you need to create a new eBay account. You can then use the "Sign in" link to log in using your new username and password.;

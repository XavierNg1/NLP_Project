 Certain lines of work may expose you to higher-than-average amounts of mold. Jobs that deal with lumber, especially, could increase your risk of an allergic reaction. Avoid jobs in carpentry, millwork, furniture repair, and logging. Agricultural work should also be avoided. Working as a dairy hand, farmer, winemaker, or working in a greenhouse might exacerbate your allergies.Bakers could also be at risk.
 Talk to your boss about your allergy and see if you can get the maintenance department to clean out potential mold sites such as overhead ducts. Bring a portable air filtration system to your workplace if possible. If you’re allowed a small plant in your office or at your desk, try English ivy, which could reduce mold counts.Keep a box of tissues handy.
Pack your nasal spray when you go to work, or leave one at your workplace. That way, if you have an allergic reaction, you’ll be prepared to recover quickly.
 Wear a mask when gardening, working with compost, mowing your yard, raking leaves, hiking in the woods, going fishing, or enjoying outdoor activities in damp or shady environments.Wearing a mask will prevent you from inhaling mold spores that could trigger an allergic reaction.
 Spending time outside immediately following a rainstorm can trigger your mold allergy. Additionally, pay attention to the weather forecast and published mold counts. When the mold count is high, refrain from outdoor activities.

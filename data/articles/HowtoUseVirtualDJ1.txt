 In the same way that the CD players used by DJs have more options than a regular Hi-Fi CD player, VirtualDJ has more options than a media player like iTunes. It lets you "mix" your songs by playing two or more tracks at the same time. You can adjust their speed so that their tempo will match, apply effects like loops or scratches, and crossfade from one side to the other.


While Virtual DJ is an expansive, useful software, many professional DJs like having the physical controls of turntables as well.;
, Virtual DJ is not an big program, but it will need a little computing power to mix and match your songs. You can see a complete list of recommended computer specs here, but the minimum requirements are pretty easy to meet:


Windows XP or Mac iOS 10.7.
512 (Windows) or 1024 (Mac) MB RAM
20-30 MB free hard drive space.
DirectX or CoreAudio compatible sound car (usually standard).
An Intel processor., Follow the on-screen installation guide to install the software onto your computer. You can find the software for free on the Virtual Dj website.


Virtual DJ 8 requires a fast computer that is closer to the "Recommended" specifications, because it is newer and has more features. Virtual DJ 7, however, was updated and improved for 18 years, and runs smoothly on almost any computer.
If you meet all of the requirements for installation but cannot access the Virtual DJ website, you can also download it through a mirror link.
 If you're actively DJing than this is an invaluable feature. Any song that is missing from your library, from an audience request to a song you don't happen to own, will be seamlessly integrated into your set. It costs $10 a month to subscribe, $299 for a one-time payment.In order to connect Virtual DJ to physical DJ equipment, you must pay a one-time licensing fee of $50.

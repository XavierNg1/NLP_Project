Use a rolling pin to roll it out into a large rectangular shape., Gently press the cookie cutter on the dough to cut each cookie., Leave a two inch space between each cookie to avoid them from binding together when they bake., Place the cookie tray in the oven. Have the cookies bake for about 8-10 minutes, until the edges are golden brown., Remove the cookie tray from the oven. Lay the cookies on a wire rack by removing them with a spatula. Have the cookies cool for about ten minutes, Split the frosting into two bowls, each bowl with Â½ cup of frosting.

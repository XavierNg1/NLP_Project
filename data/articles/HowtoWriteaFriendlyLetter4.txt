 Write a final paragraph sending your friend or loved one best wishes. The last paragraph is usually lighter in tone than the body, but it should match the general feel of the entire letter. Try to end the letter on a note that will leave your friend with positive feelings.


Reiterate the purpose of the letter. For example, if you invited your friend to come to a party, write, "I hope you can come!" If you simply wanted to wish your friend a happy season, write, "Have a wonderful Thanksgiving!" or something to that effect.
Encourage your friend to write back. If you'd like a response, write, "Hope to hear from you soon," or, "Please write back!"

, The closing you choose should be in keeping with the feel of your letter, whether it is traditional or more casual in tone. Like the salutation, it should be determined by your relationship with the recipient. Follow the closing by signing your name.


If you want to write a formal closing, consider "Sincerely," "Warmly," or "Best wishes."
If your letter is more casual in tone, try "Yours," "Take care," or "Cheers."
For a more intimate closing, choose "Love," "Much love," or "Thinking of you."

, A postscript, or PS, is often included at the end of friendly letters as a way to add information that isn't important enough to merit its own paragraph in the body of the letter. You could also write a playful joke, or leave it out altogether. In any case, make sure it matches your letter's tone and leaves your recipient with the feeling you want him or her to have.

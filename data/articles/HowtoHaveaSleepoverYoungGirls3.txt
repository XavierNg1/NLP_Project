 This is a must!

, You don't want to be all ready to snuggle up and watch a film then realize you've had nothing to eat!

, Choose some fun games and let your guests introduce some new ones. Do some dancing as well. That always gets people in the mood!

, As it begins to get later get ready for bed, but don't brush your teeth! I guarantee you'll want to eat a midnight feast later! Lie down and watch a film. Afterwards dim the lights and chat away!

, You might even want to serve a special treat like croissants or pain-Au chocolate.

 Your friend may forgive you and begin trusting you again, but they may not do it a second time or a third time. You need to stick to your promises and keep their secrets private.It doesn’t matter if they make you mad, tell you the juiciest secret of all time, or spill one of your secrets– you will never win by being a gossipy or untrustworthy person.
 If you have a bad habit of talking about others or spilling secrets, own up to it and make a change. Make a goal of not talking about anyone else for one day, then a week, and so on. Challenge yourself to talk about personal experiences, or ask others about theirs, instead of talking about people who aren’t around.Eventually, you’ll break the habit.


If you’ve earned your friend’s trust back and you want to keep it, you must change your behavior so it doesn’t happen again.
 Remember how it felt when someone gossiped about you or told one of your secrets. It probably didn’t feel very good. Remember that feeling, and use it as motivation to not make others feel that bad. You don’t want to be known as a mean or catty person, so aim to be a friend that makes people feel happy, loved, and safe.

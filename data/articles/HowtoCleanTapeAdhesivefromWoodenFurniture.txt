 After a year or so of storage, the tape will not just pull off easily and a "preconditioning" of WD-40 will loosen it right up.;
, If you are careful, it may go faster if you use a single-edged razor blade as a scraper before you shoot the adhesive reside with WD-40.
 For the single-edged razor you need to have a blade holder so you have a grip of some kind to ensure that you can control the angle of the blade. That will cost you less than $2 if you have to buy one.
 However, it will work if you don't "precondition" the tape with WD-40.
 Work with the grain of the wood, rather than working across the grain.
 Keep the razor at about a 2 to 4 degree angle to the wood. You don't need to get obsessive and measure the angle; just don't dig into the wood. If the blade starts to carve wood, you will feel the resistance to motion instantly.
, It may be very soft and ready to wipe off, or you may need to shoot it with WD-40 again. If you cannot wipe it off with a cloth, shoot it again and wait another 10 minutes.
 Use the same method: work with the shallow angle slowly, and with gentle motion.


You will be amazed at how easy this is. The WD-40 softens the tape goop and lubricates the blade, so it is less likely to dig into the wood. It is smooth as silk, but it will still leave a very thin layer of tape goop behind.
 Wipe the remaining very thin, almost invisible, and with the layer of adhesive off.

 For a bunny, leave the default pink ears and white fur on, and just change the eye color to whatever you want. Since you are a girl, change the eyes to girly eyes. If you are a wolf, change the first fur color to a color that matches your look. Leave the second color white. Change your eyes to the girly eyes and you can use whatever eye color you want, as long as it matches your look.

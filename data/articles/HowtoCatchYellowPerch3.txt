 This makes it easier to access the deeper waters where perch like to spend time throughout the fall and winter months. It's also easier to move to a new spot if they're just not biting where you set up at first., This is especially effective in early spring, when they tend to be in shallower places. Look for a spot near a rock pile, wood pile, or plenty of vegetation on the floor of the pond, lake or river. Fish near places where structures meet open water.
 No matter how shallow the water is, or what time of year, the perch will be near the bottom of the lake, pond or river you're fishing. You'll be more successful if you can position the bait there.
 Perch commonly travel in schools and hide in the dense vegetation or mud. A good technique is to use sonar to locate the schools of yellow perch, then choose a jig that resembles the vegetation or mud in which they are hiding.


Maggots with weights forcing them to sink to the bottom should be used when the schools are feeding on insects and plankton.
Bobbers should be added to the line when perch are schooling in plant vegetation. This will help keep your bait still and prevent the perch from steeling it off the hook.
 You need to figure out how to best reach the perch where you are. If something isnâ€™t working, try a new technique. Just as your bait should be adjusted to attract perch according to their current feeding location, you should also adjust your technique to fit the situation.


Allow the bait to hit the bottom before wheeling back in.
If you have hit in one spot and then the bites have quieted, cast in a circle around the boat.
Run the boat motor, perch are attracted by the noise and vibration.
Hit the rod against the bottom, then move the rod in quick little flicks to make the bait vibrate.
 You might wait for hours to get a nibble, but when you catch one, many more usually follow, since perch hang out in schools. Land each fish and get your line back out to catch more.

This is the most common and straightforward way to remove a grease or oil stain., Thoroughly scrub the affected spot with your degreasing solution and a microfiber towel or rag. If you notice any of the color of your leather transfer onto the rag, stop immediately and allow the area to dry before resuming., Again, distilled water is best for this, but tap water will work. Be sure that no lather or soapy residue is left behind. The soapy residue will collect dirt.

 You can tell if your Tamagotchi is hungry, sad, angry, sick, or sleeping when it sets off an alert. The last icon will be highlighted. Check your Tamagotchi and take care of whatever it needs, depending on the situation. If nothing seems to be wrong, give it some discipline. This will add a bar to the training meter. You cannot further the meter at the adult stage.

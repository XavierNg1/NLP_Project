 After school, look over the notes you took in class that day for 15 to 20 minutes. As a test approaches, review your notes for the entire unit or chapter more thoroughly. Pay special attention to the example problems the teacher provided in class, since these will help break down how a given procedure or formula works., Suppose you were assigned odd numbers for homework because the even numbers’ answers are in the back of the book. Work on those even-numbered problems, then check your answers to see where your strengths and weaknesses are.Ask your teacher if your math book has an online website. Sometimes online textbooks can help by providing quizzes and additional instructional material.
 Different people see concepts in different ways. Something that you have difficulty understanding may come easily to a study partner. If everyone in the group is confused about something, ask the teacher for help.You could meet once or twice a week in person, talk over the phone, or chat online.
 If you’re in a study group, you can create and exchange practice tests for each other. Ask a family member or someone in your class to work on practice examples together. If your textbook has a website, see if you can download practice exams.Give yourself a time limit when taking a practice test to simulate the real thing.
 You deserve a break after a few hours of intense studying! Figure out some way to treat yourself after studying hard to help motivate yourself.For example, you could have a candy bar, go on a bike ride, play a game for 20 minutes, or do something other low-key activity you enjoy.
 Try not to be stressed as the exam approaches. Get a good night’s sleep the night before the exam. Have a full breakfast that morning and, if the test is later in the day, a good lunch.Try having a light, healthy snack, like almonds, before the test to give your brain a little more fuel.

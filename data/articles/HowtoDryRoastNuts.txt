 Cover the baking sheet with greaseproof paper and preheat the oven to 420 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius). Shell the nuts and, if necessary, remove their skins.;
, Spread the nuts evenly on the baking sheet. You can sprinkle them with a little salt if you like. Roast the nuts for 5 - 10 minutes, being careful not to let them burn. You should be able to tell when the nuts are ready by the fragrant smell they produce when roasted.
 Leave the nuts to cool for a few minutes, as the oil inside will still be very hot. Enjoy as a healthy alternative to potato based snacks.

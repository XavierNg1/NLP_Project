 Regular usage of hard water can lead to dry, irritated skin. Combat this effect right after showering, bathing, or washing your face by moisturizing right away. Use a facial moisturizer and rich body lotion, and apply generously.Warm coconut oil can also be used as an intensive body moisturizer.;
, Hard water may leave mineral deposits in your hair and on your scalp, leaving it dry. Counteract this effect by purchasing a chelating shampoo, which contains an ingredient that bonds with the minerals in hard water and helps to rinse them away. Look for a shampoo (in pharmacies, beauty supply stores, or online) that contain “EDTA”, or Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetate., Hard water makes it difficult for soap to dissolve, leaving a buildup on your skin that can have negative effects (e.g. dryness, irritation). Using less soap can lessen this effect simply by cutting down the amount of potential buildup. When washing, focus larger amounts of soap on areas where you perspire frequently (like your underarms) and use it sparingly on the rest of your body.

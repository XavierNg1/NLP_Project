 The area should be open, with enough room to plant at least one tree. If you can't find any open space, then head to Tom Nook's store and see if he has in axe in stock. If he doesn't, then wait, and check back every day. Once he has an axe in stock, purchase it. He will want around 500 bells for it. Once you have the axe, go to the place where you want to plant the trees, and chop down any that are in the way.;
,,, If you don't, search for a fruit tree in town. Shake the tree, and grab one of the fruits that come down. Once you have fruit, go to the hole that you dug, open your pockets again and click on the fruit. Three options should come up: Grab, Bury and Never Mind. Using your stylus, touch bury, and your character will bury the fruit. A few seconds later, a small tree should pop up from the ground.
 Water it every day, and this will ensure that the tree grows. To water the tree, face it and press the A button, with the watering can equipped.
 To get the fruit down, simply shake the tree. Take the fruit to Tom Nook's shop and he will give you bells for it, depending on the fruit.

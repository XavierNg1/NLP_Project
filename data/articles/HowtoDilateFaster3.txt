 A foley catheter is a flexible tube with a balloon attached. When a doctor inserts the catheter into the cervix and fills it with fluid, the balloon swells, exerting continuous pressure on the cervix. In addition, the procedure separates the membranes, which results in the release of prostaglandins and faster dilation. This method is the most common way to dilate your cervix mechanically.
 Laminaria is a seaweed that, when dried, becomes hygroscopic -- that is, it attracts and retains water. When a doctor inserts Laminaria into the cervix, it absorbs water and swells, exerting additional pressure and encouraging dilation.

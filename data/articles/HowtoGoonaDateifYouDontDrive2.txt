 If you and your date do not live within walking distance of each other or are unable to take public transportation, ask someone you trust for a ride. Be courteous when asking. Be sure to plan everything for your date in advance, and involve the person driving you in your transportation plans, as they’ll be spending their time helping you.


When you ask for a ride, remember to be polite. For instance, try saying, “If you would be able to give me a ride this Friday to see my friend, I would really appreciate it,” or “Could you give me a lift this weekend to go out with someone special?”
Plan exactly when you will need to be dropped off, and if necessary, when you will need to be picked up.
 Sometimes, if you can’t find a ride for your specific date, you may be able to “hitch a ride,” with people who are heading to an event or in the same direction you are. Grabbing a ride is a great way to get to your destination without having to ask for special favors, or worrying about answering any awkward questions during the trip. Whether you hitch a ride and meet your date out, or both of you are able to go on the ride, make sure you’re polite and thank the person who is driving.


For instance, if there is a sporting event or local fair that you want to attend with your date, plan ahead and find out if any of your licensed friends or family are going. Ask for a ride and meet your date there.
If you have a sibling that is going out, ask if they, or whomever is driving them, can drop you, or you and your date, off on their way.
 Download the Uber app or the Lyft app. Once you have set up your account, you can use these apps to call rides for yourself whenever you need them. Use the app to call a ride to head to where your date lives, or to go to a place that is close to where your date lives.


Use Uber or Lyft to pick your date up and take them to a movie.
If your date wants you to come spend some time at their home, use Uber and Lyft to get there.

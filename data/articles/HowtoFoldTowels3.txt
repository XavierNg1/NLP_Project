 Fold the long sides of the hand towel in to meet at the center, with one side slightly overlapping the other (like the sides of a buttoned shirt).
 Fold the hand towel roughly in half (gap sides together), so that the front section is about 3-4" shorter than the other.
 Flip the top section down over the top of the bottom section until a collar forms. Some adjusting may be needed to get it to look just perfect.
 Place washcloth on a flat surface diagonally, so that it makes a diamond shape.


Then, fold the left and right corners in to the center and tuck the tips, so that a sort of burrito shape is formed. Tuck down the top corner and flip the whole thing over.






You should now have something that looks somewhat like a tie.
 Tuck the tie into the shirt collar and place the whole thing on a bed, dresser, or other flat surface to display.

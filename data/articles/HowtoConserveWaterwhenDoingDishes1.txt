 You can save water by installing an energy-efficient faucet to restrict the water flow. This is especially useful if you have a household member who leaves the tap running!, It is difficult to tell how much water gets used to produce dishes, but disposable dishes like paper or plastic plates use much less water in your home. Paper plates can't be recycled, but plastic dishes that don't have food on them can go in the recycling bin. Try scraping or wiping food off plastic plates instead of rinsing them off., Don’t use the faucet to power-wash food off your plates. Scrape off solid food and garbage with a utensil over the garbage can or compost bucket. Don’t use the garbage disposal to get rid of food scraps--it uses water too., Before you start washing, put all the dirty dishes next to the sink or dishwasher so you don’t have to turn the faucet on and off while bringing the dishes over. Be sure to check the rest of your home for stray coffee cups or snack plates., The sooner you start washing your dishes after eating, the less water you’ll use. If you let food harden on your dishes, you’ll need to use more water to soak them and wash them.

 Multiplying a*b = c is also the same as b*a=c. However, the sign of the product can change depending on the signs of the original numbers:

If both a and b have the same signs, the sign of the product is positive. For example:






When a and b are positive numbers and not equal to zero: +a * + b = +c
When a and b are both negative numbers and not equal to zero: -a*-b = +c


If a and b have unlike signs, the sign of the product is negative. For example:

When a is positive and b is negative: +a * -b = -c








However, understand that any number multiplied by zero, equals zero.
 Unless the integer is zero, any number multiplied by 1 is the number itself.

For example: a*1 = a






Remember, any number multiplied by zero, equals zero.
 The distributive property of multiplication says that any number "a" multiplied by the addends "b" and "c" in parenthesis, is the same as "a" multiplied by "c" plus "a" multiplied by "b".


For example: a(b+c) = ab + ac
Mathematically, this looks like: 5(2+3) = 5(2) + 5(3)
Note that there is no inverse property for multiplication because the inverse of a whole number is a fraction, and fractions are not an element of integer.

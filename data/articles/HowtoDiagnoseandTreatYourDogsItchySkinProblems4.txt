 Improving your dog’s overall nutrition will help their general health whether or not your dog is allergic to food.


If you feed processed foods, look at the ingredient list on your dog’s food. Check to make sure that protein is the first ingredient, not a carbohydrate. Essential fatty acids are good for healthy skin and coat and should be included on the ingredient list.,, Fatty acid supplements such as fish oil, coconut oil or flaxseed oil are helpful with allergic skin disease cases. These are best fed in their pure form (fresh or tinned fish, freshly ground flax seeds), but are also available as capsules or liquids., Follow the product directions or your veterinarian’s instructions for dosage information.
 If a food allergy is suspected, your veterinarian may suggest a food elimination trial with a completely new and different diet for your pet. This new diet will need to consist of ingredients your dog has never eaten before.


For example, if your pet has been eating lamb and rice dog food with treats made of beef and wheat, the new diet cannot contain any of those ingredients.
The food elimination trial will typically last for 2-3 months.
You need to adhere to the strict diet (including treats) in order to get the best information from your experiment.
It may take a few rounds of this food elimination diet to determine which foods your dog is sensitive to.
You may be able to get your dog’s food at a pet store, but often a special diet from your veterinarian may be needed to manage a pet’s food allergy.Once a diet has been found, then you can start challenging the body with small amounts of one ingredient at a time to see if your dog starts itching again after introducing the additional ingredient.

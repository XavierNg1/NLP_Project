 You might want to camp with some people but people might call you weird or the crowds would get in the way and you can't have fun.
 Mt. Shiveer or Sarepia make nice wilderness camping and they both have fires, but if you want to beach camp, Crystal Sands is your place. You might just want to camp in a secluded corner of Jamaa Township., You should roast marshmallows if you have a fire, go hiking, sing a song or two, and enjoy spending time with friends.
 Wear cold weather clothing in Mt. Shiveer. If your in Sarepia Forest or other places (besides Crystal Sands) you might want to wear a pirate sword, a blanket, a feather (if you can), and shoes. At night an old hood or bunny hat along with your blanket can be quite cozy.

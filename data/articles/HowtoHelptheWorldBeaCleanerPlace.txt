 Recycle everything you can, not just the soda cans that give you money. Sure, a little extra money is handy, but go the extra mile and collect everything: old paper, bottles, even batteries.;
, Go to a popular park or street and pick up litter. Sort out the recyclables from the refuse, and be sure to wear gloves; you never know where the trash has been.
 This can be as simple as telling a friend, or as ambitious as starting a local group, or even a worldwide organization.
 Things like clothes and old equipment can be donated. Old bottles and egg cartons can be made into neat crafts. Moldy food cans be used to make compost.
 As mentioned above, old and half-eaten food can be good fertilizer for a local garden. Just be sure of what is in the foods. Be sure to include grass and lawn clippings and to turn your pile over.

 Women that have recurrent or unexplained miscarriages often respond to treatment with progesterone, and are able to maintain the next pregnancy.Prevent early miscarriage. Progesterone deficiency is not the cause of every miscarriage, but scientific research indicates that adequate amounts of progesterone are needed to support the early stages of pregnancy.Progesterone levels naturally increase during each menstrual cycle once ovulation has occurred. This allows for the uterine wall to thicken to provide support for the pregnancy. This is called the luteal phase.Once the released egg has been fertilized, the lining of the uterus provides protection for the egg as it begins to develop. After the first few weeks, the placenta takes over, producing the additional hormones and nutrients needed.Some women have naturally lower levels of progesterone. Some studies suggest that low levels during the first few weeks of pregnancy can cause the uterine lining to be inadequate to support the pregnancy, causing the miscarriage. Evidence for this is limited, however.Inadequate levels of progesterone needed to support the early stage of pregnancy are sometimes referred to as a luteal phase defect.;
, Using progesterone vaginal inserts may help prevent early miscarriage, depending on the cause of the miscarriage.The scientific literature supports the use of vaginally applied progesterone, via inserts or suppositories, to help maintain the lining of the uterus to support the pregnancy.While other ways to administer progesterone are available, such as injections, oral dosing, and topical creams, for women with luteal phase defects and recurrent or unexplained miscarriages, this is the recommended method of delivery., ART helps to induce pregnancy by using procedures that remove the eggs from the woman, combine them with sperm in a laboratory setting, then return them to the woman’s body, or to another woman’s body.There are many methods that help couples to achieve pregnancy. ART is one only one method. Women that participate in ART require supplementation of hormones, like progesterone, to help their bodies create a healthy environment to maintain the pregnancy., Progesterone administered by either intramuscular injection or by vaginal products have been shown to be effective in establishing the initial higher levels of progesterone needed during ART.Injectable progesterone is sometimes used but carries additional risks for complications since progesterone is very rapidly absorbed and is quickly changed into other chemicals.By altering the delivery system of the injection, the active progesterone can remain in its desired chemical form as long as possible. This means altering the liquid, or vehicle, the active drug is placed in, by using oils, such as peanut oil. Do not use this form of progesterone if you are allergic to peanuts.Possible complications from progesterone injections include developing an allergy to the inactive ingredients, abscesses and pain at the site of injection, and unwanted bleeding into the muscle tissue., Vaginal delivery products produce lower systemic levels of progesterone, but higher levels in the endometrium, which is the goal.A product designed to deliver progesterone in this manner, and specifically in the group of women that are using ART, is a progesterone gel product currently marketed under the brand name of Crinone®.Crinone® is available containing either 4% or 8% of progesterone. The 8% product is recommended for use in women participating in ART.Avoid using Crinone® in some situations. This product should not be used if you are allergic to any progesterone products, have unusual vaginal bleeding, have ever had liver problems, cancer of the breast or genital organs, or blood clots. If you have had a recent miscarriage, see your doctor first., Get emergency medical help if you have any signs of an allergic reaction. Signs of an allergic reaction include hives, difficulty breathing, and swelling in your face, mouth, or throat.Emergency medical care is also warranted if you experience pain in the calves or chest, sudden headache, numbness or weakness, especially if you notice this to be on only one side of your body, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or coughing up blood. Emergency care is also needed for problems with your vision or speaking, feeling dizzy, faint, or problems with balance, changes in vision or speech, chest pain, pain spreading to the arm or shoulder, weakness or numbness in an arm or leg, pain or swelling in the legs, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, loss of appetite, low grade fever, or changes in your urine., Amenorrhea is the medical term used when a female is not having a period, when she should be.Amenorrhea can be classed as either primary or secondary. The features of primary amenorrhea involve the absence of a period in a 15 to 16 year old girl who has otherwise gone through normal developmental changes.Secondary amenorrhea is diagnosed when a woman who has had regular menstrual cycles stops having her period.In many cases, the cause of secondary amenorrhea can be changes in your routine, excessive weight loss, eating disorders, excessive exercising, stress, and pregnancy.Other causes for secondary amenorrhea can include medications taken for other medical conditions, such as schizophrenia or chemotherapy agents used to treat cancer. Medical conditions that can cause secondary amenorrhea include polycystic ovarian syndrome, thyroid function abnormalities, and tumors found near the pituitary gland in the brain., Your doctor will do lab work and run tests to look for any underlying medical causes for your amenorrhea.


In some cases, your doctor may prescribe progesterone supplements to correct the problem. Progesterone helps cause a withdrawal bleed similar to your period. You do not necessarily have a progesterone deficiency if you have amenorrhea., Short-term use of either oral medication, progesterone injections, or vaginal gel, may be prescribed to help balance your hormones and cause you to resume your regular periods.If you continue to have problems with abnormal cycles, your doctor may prescribe oral contraceptives that contain progesterone to help establish a regular cycle. He or she will monitor your progress to determine the best time to discontinue the medications., Get emergency medical help if you have any signs of an allergic reaction. Signs of an allergic reaction include hives, difficulty breathing, and swelling in your face, mouth, or throat., The use of low-dose hormone replacement therapy, now referred to as menopausal hormone therapy, involves products that contain small amounts of estrogen and progesterone, or their derivatives.Use progesterone to treat symptoms of perimenopause and menopause. Some women begin to notice changes that are consistent with menopause, even before they have stopped having their menstrual cycle. This time is referred to as perimenopause.In some women, progesterone products can be used to help manage symptoms of perimenopause.Research supports the use of progesterone supplementation during this time, as natural levels of female hormones are starting to change., Progesterone products come in several different forms, including oral tablets, vaginal gels and inserts, injections, and topical creams. A prescription strength topical cream is often prescribed to help with symptoms of perimenopause.To use the cream, a small amount is rubbed into the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or other areas where the skin is soft, either once or twice daily., The symptoms associated with perimenopause and menopause can be disruptive to your normal routine, and severe enough to treat.Talk to your doctor to determine if combination products that contain both estrogen and progesterone may help to provide the increased progesterone levels your body may need, while maintaining a balance in both hormones.
Women with a uterus require both estrogen and progesterone to treat menopause symptoms with hormones. Women without a uterus do not require progesterone to treat menopause symptoms and should use estrogen only. Using a combination product if you do not have a uterus may increase your risk of breast cancer, heart attack, or stroke., Over time, men also experience changes in naturally occurring hormone levels.In men, progesterone plays a key role in the production of testosterone.As men age, progesterone and testosterone levels drop, and the balance in hormone shifts to make estrogen the dominant hormone.Some of the symptoms men experience when progesterone levels drop can include low libido, hair loss, weight gain, fatigue, and depression.Talk to your doctor if you are male and are noticing these changes. Your doctor will run tests to determine the levels of many different hormones to determine the best course of treatment., If your doctor prescribes medications that contain progesterone or a combination of estrogen and progesterone, get emergency medical help if you have any signs of an allergic reaction. Signs of an allergic reaction include hives, difficulty breathing, and swelling in your face, mouth, or throat.Emergency medical care is also warranted if you experience pain in the calves or chest, sudden headache, numbness or weakness, especially if you notice this to be on only one side of your body, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or coughing up blood. Emergency care is also needed for problems with your vision or speaking, feeling dizzy, faint, or problems with balance, changes in vision or speech, chest pain, pain spreading to the arm or shoulder, weakness or numbness in an arm or leg, pain or swelling in the legs, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, loss of appetite, low grade fever, or changes in your urine., Your doctor can provide direction, specific to your body and your situation, that can help you choose the best way to increase your progesterone levels.Your doctor is your best resource to understanding the changes or problems you are experiencing. Discuss supplements and lifestyle adjustments with your doctor to be sure that is the best option for you.
 Vitamin C, vitamin E, l-arginine, vitamin B6, selenium, and beta carotene have all been shown to increase progesterone levels.While natural sources of these supplements are part of a healthy diet, the vitamin or supplement content found in natural sources is not enough to make a difference in increasing your progesterone levels. Consider using manufactured products that contain higher concentrations of vitamins and supplements., Studies have shown the following amounts to be beneficial in increasing progesterone levels:


Consume 750mg of Vitamin C per day (increased progesterone levels by as much as 77%).Consume 600mg of Vitamin E per day (Increased progesterone in 67% of patients studied) .Take 6gm per day of L-arginine (improved serum progesterone in 71% of patients) .Take 200mg to 800mg per day of vitamin B6 (reduces blood levels of estrogen and improves concentrations of progesterone) .Add selenium to your daily vitamin doses (consuming selenium at any dose was shown to improve progesterone levels) .Consume more beta-carotene (studies in animals showed improvement in progesterone levels and fertility) ., Losing weight, avoiding large meals, eating a high protein and low carbohydrate diet, decreasing saturated fat intake, and increasing consumption of unsaturated fats, are recommended to improve your levels of progesterone.Studies in overweight women show that losing as little as 5% of your body weight improves your progesterone levels.In an animal study, the amount of available food was controlled during early pregnancy, resulting in higher levels of hormones needed to support pregnancy in the group that was not allowed to over eat.Dietary changes that included higher amounts of protein and lower amounts of carbohydrates were positively correlated to improving progesterone levels in the women studied.One animal study showed significant increases in progesterone when the diet was higher in omega 3 and omega 6 products contained in flaxseed, combined with a lower intake of saturated fats., While dairy products contain only small amounts of progesterone, research has shown a significant increase in progesterone levels in men when they consumed three servings per day of high-fat dairy products., The nicotine found in cigarettes can interfere with the way your ovaries naturally produce hormones, which disrupts processes involved with normal cyclic functioning.Cigarette smoking also adds to the risk of serious, and possibly life-threatening, adverse events when combined with products that contain estrogen or progesterone., Stress only adds to the complications that are already at work as you are trying to provide a healthy hormonal balance.Use relaxation techniques that help you to breathe more deeply and stretch your muscles to reduce tension.Take time out for a massage, and routinely take part in activities you enjoy.Take care of your body by getting enough sleep, eating healthy, and participate in physical activity on a regular basis.

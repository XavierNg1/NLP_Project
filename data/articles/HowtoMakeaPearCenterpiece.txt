 Basically, you'll need about 8 to a dozen pears, depending on the size of the container you're using, velvet ribbon, pieces of greenery, such as boxwood stalks, and a container. The container should be something you're proud to place on the table, such as a stem bowl, large bowl, cake stand, etc.


The pears must have their original stalk intact; don't use those which are missing a stalk.;
, Aim to have the better looking pieces facing outward to view.
 Wash the pears first and ensure that they're dry before proceeding. Washing them is important because people can take a pear and eat it as they wish if they know it has been cleaned. Then, cut equal lengths from the velvet ribbon and tie bows on the stalks of each pear.
 Simply arrange them pyramid style, with the most at the base, building up to a single one at the top. Check that the pears are sitting firmly and that all stalks are clearly visible with their pretty bows.
 Another alternative is to place the arrangement on a sideboard as a room decoration––ideal for parties, open home inspections and for creating a cheery ambiance.

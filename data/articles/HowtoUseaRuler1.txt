 A ruler is a measuring stick marked with units for measuring along its edge. These can be made of plastic, cardboard, metal, or fabric. marked units for measuring length along its edge.
These can be for either English (inches) or metric (centimeters) units of measurement.
In the U.S. and the UK, a student's rule is from 12 to 36 inches, or from one to three feet long. Different fractions of inches or centimeters are used to make measurements more accurate.;
, This is a soft fabric tape, also marked with numbers representing inches or centimeters. This can be wrapped around a person's torso, to measure chest, waist, neck, and other sizes for sewing clothing.
It may be used for measuring length, such as inseams and sleeves of garments.
Using these to measure 3-dimensional objects that are curved is best.
 These are about 6 feet long and can be folded to fit into a tool pouch or pocket. These are also called "stick rules".
Typically, these are made up of 8 inch segments.
They are scaled in metric units and foot and inch measures, and fractions are marked to 1/16 inch.
 Also called measuring tapes, these are flexible metal or fiberglass tapes. These have a spring to rewind them into a case.
They are also rolled on a spool in lengths of 100 meters (or 330 feet) and longer.
Most measuring tapes have one side for standard and metric units.
 These are not actual lengths of measurement but will give distances to scale from a size ratio. These are "scale" rulers, with special marks representing a size ratio.
For example "1 inch equals 1 foot".
These are used for drawing precisely scaled blueprints and building plans.

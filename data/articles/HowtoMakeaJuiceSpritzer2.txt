 You can use any flavor juice you want. The juice concentrate must be frozen, but if you cannot spoon out a solid spoonful, you may let it thaw slightly until it is soft enough to work with.
 Seltzer will produce the purest taste, but any type of carbonated water will work. Pour the water directly over the frozen juice, allowing the juice to "fizz" or dissolve as you pour.
 Use a slow circular motion and stop once the frozen juice is completely dissolved. Stirring too fast or too long can lead to a drop in carbonation.
 Drop the frozen juice concentrate into a glass and pour seltzer or other carbonated water over it. Stir until dissolved.
 The drink should still be plenty cold from the juice concentrate, but you can add more ice if you want it even colder.

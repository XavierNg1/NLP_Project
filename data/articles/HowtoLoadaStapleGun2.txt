 Start disconnecting the stapler by switching the “on/off” button to “off” on the compressor. This switch will be found behind the tank. The tank is usually cylindrical and contains the pressurized air. Now disconnect the hose release by loosening the nut beneath the gun. While most nuts can be loosened by hand, you may need to find the right screwdriver to loosen the nut.Now your stapler should be fully released.


If your gun has a safety trip, put it in place before moving forward. A safety trip prevents the gun from firing off while reloading.
 On your pneumatic stapler, the magazine follower is a rod that sets the magazine in place and will be underneath the front. Squeeze the lever and pull away from the stapler to remove the magazine.Pull the follower all the way out. Once the magazine is pulled out, it will be locked into position., Taking an entire strip of staples, lay them leg-first into the rail. The staples should be able to move freely, without getting caught, up and down the rail.


If your staple row has broken, you can load several smaller ones together.
 Unlock the follower by squeezing the lever and releasing it.The stapler may automatically push the staples back into the staple gun. If not, give it a small push, and it should automatically engage.
 Plug your compressor back into the bottom of the pneumatic gun and reconnect the hose to the stapler. Put on protective gear for your eyes and ears and then power on the compressor.Push the stapler against a piece of wood and pull the trigger. You should have one clean staple as a result.


Test the stapler gun by stapling into a scrap piece of wood. Try to use a piece that is as close to the thickness of the actual items that you are stapling together or are made from the same material. For example, if you are stapling into particle board, use scrap pieces of particle board to test the stapler.

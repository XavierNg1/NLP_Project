 Baby wipes are the easiest method of cleaning your rabbit without bathing it. Use baby wipes that are fragrance-free, alcohol-free and hypo-allergenic for best results. You want a wipe that is strong enough to clean your bunny without tearing, and which is soft so that it won’t hurt your bunny’s skin.


Some wipes come fortified with vitamin E or aloe. These are fine to use on a rabbit.;
, You might find it easiest to do the spot-cleaning by holding the rabbit in your lap, or between your knees as you sit on the floor. You’ll want to hold your bunny in a position that allows you to clean his dirty parts, which will usually mean he should be held belly-up.You can use a towel to help you hold the bunny in place.
If the area that requires cleaning can be reached by keeping the bunny upright, you can simply place him on a towel on the floor.
 Using the baby wipes, gently rub away any debris, soil, or residue from the bunny’s fur. If needed, clean around the bunny’s bottom or privates, which might be stained with urine if your rabbit is having incontinence issues.Try to get the skin as clean as possible, but always be very gentle. The bunny’s skin is very delicate.
When you’ve cleaned away the debris, give the rabbit another quick rub with a clean wipe.

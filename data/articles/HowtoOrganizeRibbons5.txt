 The bigger, the better.
 Here you have two options, depending on the type of coat hangers you've found:


If the coat hanger tiers undo, simply thread on the ribbon rounds.
If the coat hanger tiers are fixed, you'll need to improvise. Save some toilet paper rolls. Make a fine slit and attach each roll across the tiers until all tiers are full and tape up the slit. Wind the ribbon around these rolls.

If you’re planting a mum plant, the hole should be at least twice as big as the rootball of the plant. If you’re planting seeds, you'll need a few holes about the size of a pencil, which you can easily make with your fingers.If you're transplanting mums from a plastic pot to the soil, the hole you dig should be the same depth as the pot they came in. So if the pot is six inches tall, plant your mums in a hole six inches deep.
Space the holes about 18 to 24 inches (45 to 50 cm) apart to make sure the flowers have room to grow without getting tangled up. The number of holes you need will depend on how plants or packets of seeds you buy, and how much space you have. You'll be placing 5 to 6 seeds per hole.

You should add compost or peat to your hole whether you're transplanting plants or planting seeds., If you're transplanting a plant, gently remove it from its container by flipping the container over and gently tapping the bottom until the plant slides out.

Once the plants or seeds are in the hole, fill it the rest of the way with soil and pat it down with your hand.

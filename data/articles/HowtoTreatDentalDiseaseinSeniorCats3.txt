, Your cat may show few signs of dental pain. However, even if you observe few physical or behavioral signs of dental disease, it is wise to get your senior cat’s teeth checked out. Your veterinarian will be able to make an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.The first stage of diagnosis is a visual examination.
The second stage of diagnosis involves a periodontal probe to measure gingivitis.
At a minimum, get your cat’s teeth examined once a year.If your cat has been experiencing dental problems, you should get them examined more frequently, perhaps every three or four months., Your cat could be diagnosed with a number of kinds of dental disease, such as mild gingivitis, moderate gingivitis, severe gingivitis, periodontitis or stomatitis. Since treatment options will vary depending on the type and severity of your senior cat’s dental disease, you should ask your veterinarian for a full account of the diagnosis:“How would you describe their dental disease?”
“Is the gingivitis mild, moderate or severe?”
“What are the treatment options”
“Are there any possible treatment complications due to my cat’s other medical conditions?”

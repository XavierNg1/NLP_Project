 If you were provided with a supply list, follow the guidelines on that list. If you were not, there are a few things you will almost definitely need: A pack of pencils, a pack of pens, two or three spiral notebooks, one or two composition books, and a one-inch binder. These supplies are all that you will need the first week or two - anything else can be picked up at a later date.;
, The first few days will most likely not be instructional, as they are usually spent reading the code of conduct. All you will need is a binder for any handouts, and a pen or pencil. Bring in the rest of your supplies when you receive a locker, and store them in that.
 Be sure that they coordinate and will not distract you or make you uncomfortable - you should be confident and comfortable so you can make the best impression possible. Also, have your schedule memorized - clogging up the hallway while you stare bewilderingly at your schedule will only cause disaster. Make sure to bring your schedule, anyway, just in case you forget the exact room number of a class. Also, be sure that you are not breaking your school's dress code.
 This varies from person to person. Be absolutely sure to get at least eight hours of sleep, at a minimum. 9-10 hours will give you a well-rested feeling without having to go to sleep at a crazy hour. A good idea would be to try to fall asleep between nine and ten, and wake up at about six. This may need to be adjusted, depending on your schoolâ€™s start time and your morning routine.
 Be sure to eat a healthy, filling breakfast. Take a shower, get dressed and brush your teeth well. Style your hair the way you like it. Do everything you need to feel prepared and confident for the day ahead.
 You will create a wonderful start to the last year of middle school.

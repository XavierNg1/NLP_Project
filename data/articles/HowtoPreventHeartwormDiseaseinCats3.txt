 If your cat shows any signs of respiratory or digestive problems, you should take him to the vet immediately. These signs are common signs for many different illnesses. Your vet can do an exam to determine the root cause for the symptoms.


Even if your cat does not show any signs, you should take him to the vet for checkups where your vet checks him for heartworms.
 During a physical exam of the cat, the vet may notice heart problems, such as an arrhythmia or a heart murmur. Otherwise, the vet may notice a non-specific respiratory problem, or the examination may be normal. Tests for heartworm antigen or antibodies toward heartworm can be done on blood.X-rays or ultrasounds of the chest may show enlarged arteries, lung changes, or an enlarged heart, all of which could indicate heartworm infection.
 Unlike dogs, there is no specific treatment for cats with heartworms. An injection of a harsh medication can be given to the cat, but is very risky and unsafe for cats. A surgical procedure to remove the adult worms from the heart can be undertaken by trained veterinarians, but this also is risky and can result in death.The most common treatment is to treat the symptoms, especially if your cat has HARD.
Sometimes a spontaneous death of the worms occurs within two to three years so no treatment may be necessary other than treatment of any symptoms.

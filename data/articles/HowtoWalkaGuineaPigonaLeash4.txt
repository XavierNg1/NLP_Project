 A large cage is important because it gives your guinea pig a large area to explore. The larger the cage is, the better off your guinea pig will be. At a minimum, each guinea pig should have 7.5 square feet of cage.That's a cage that's approximately 3 by 2.5 feet.
If you can, go for a bigger cage, so your guinea pig will need less exercise outside of its cage.
 You can buy a cage for a guinea pig. However, most cages that are labelled for guinea pigs are not big enough. You can find ones meant for other animals, though, that will work for guinea pigs. Pick one that has metal bars on the side, not wood, as guinea pigs can't chew through metal.Also, make sure it has a solid floor. Guinea pigs' feet are easily damaged by floors that are made of wire, so it needs to be solid to protect your guinea pig.
Go for a larger floor space rather than one that has many levels. Floor space is more important.
 Another option is making your own. You can make your own cages out of wire fences on the floor with other materials underneath. One option is to use corrugated correx or corrugated coroplast, available from sign making shops.Start with cube grids. Cube grids can be reconfigured to any size to make an outward "cage."
Cut the correx or coroplast to fit. You can use the material as a floor, then use more of it to create a border around the floor. Tape it together from the outside. Add newspapers and hay for your guinea pig to complete the cage.

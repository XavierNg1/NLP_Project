 Label it "grams" or "g." If you're using a calculator, just type the number in.


In this section, we'll follow along with an example problem to make things easier. Let's say that we want to convert 20,000 grams to kilograms. To start, we would write "20,000 grams" on our paper.;
, A kilogram is one thousand grams. This means that to get kilograms from grams, you just need to divide the number of grams by 1,000.


In our example, we would get kilograms by dividing 20,000 grams by 1,000.



20,000/1,000 = 20






, Don't forget this step! Labeling your answer with the proper units is important. If you're doing this conversion for schoolwork, you can lose points if you don't label. If you're doing it for something else, people may assume the wrong units.


In our case, we would label our answer with the label "kilograms" like this:




20 kilograms.
 As discussed above, a kilogram is one thousand grams. This means that if you ever want to get back to grams from kilograms, all you need to do is multiply the number of kilograms by 1,000. Since multiplications is basically the "opposite" operation as division, this will "undo" the division and give you grams.


To get 20 kilograms back to grams, we just multiply by 1,000 (don't forget to label your answer again):
20 kilograms Ã— 1,000 = 20,000 grams

 Dental or “relief” wax should be available from your orthodontist, or at your local drug store. Roll the wax into a ball that is about the size of a popcorn kernel or a pea. The wax should be easy to mold with your hands.If you can’t find dental wax at the store, and your orthodontist is unavailable, you can order it online.
 Use a paper towel to dry the brace and the wire. The wax will not stick well if the wire is very wet. Try to keep your mouth dry while you apply the wax by breathing through your mouth and not swallowing., Once the wax is on the wire, smooth it down over the end of the wire all the way to the bracket. This should make the end of the wire soft enough that it no longer irritates your cheeks or gums.The wax may fall out at some point. You can replace the wax as often as necessary until your orthodontist can fix the wire permanently.
Dental wax isn’t toxic or dangerous, so don’t worry if you accidentally swallow it.

 Contact the people running it and ask about having a stall there. There will probably be a small charge, so make sure you have enough stuff of a high enough quality to sell to cover this charge. You don't want to make a loss.;
, It's no good trying to sell the same things as every other person at the craft fair. Sell something different to reduce the competition.
 Different people prefer different sizes of artwork, depending on where they want to put it and how much money they are willing to spend. Create some large pieces which you can sell for a lot and will draw people to your stall, but also create lots of small ones which you can make quickly and sell cheaply.
 Putting paintings, photographs and other flat artwork in a frame makes it look more professional and encourages people to buy it. Choose a variety of simple frames and give people the option of exchanging the frame you have put a picture in for another.
 Display this prominently on your stall. People like to know a little bit about the person who has created the artwork they are buying.
 Consider both the cost of materials, the amount of time put into each piece and the size of the piece. Don't price your art so high that people won't buy it, but don't go so low that you don't make a good profit on it.
 Just dumping your stuff on a table won't inspire people to come and look at your artwork. Make the set up of your stall a work of art in itself to attract people to it. Get a table cloth (or just a plain piece of fabric) and cardboard boxes in different sizes. Use these to create a display on different heights so people can see your work easily.
 Don't push people into buying something, this puts people off. Be friendly and be prepared to answer any questions people may have about your artwork.

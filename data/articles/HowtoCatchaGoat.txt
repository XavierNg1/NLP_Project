 Find the goat by checking hedges for hole, looking up in trees (yes, trees!), flower gardens, inside your house, down the road, over the river, etc. Goats naturally explore and can be very curious.;
, Goats know where their escape routes are, and they are faster and more agile than you, so you don't want to startle it.
 Figure out what to grab when the goat starts running. If the goat wears a collar or other such device, try that. Horns can be used as handles as well, but are not always as strong as they appear and can break.
 Ideally the head should be held up as well.
 No fence short of one designed for a federal prison will reliably hold a goat. Tethering in most cases is pretty much the only way to go. A good fence can hold a goat if they are happy. Tethering a goat can be dangerous because they can easily strangle themselves.

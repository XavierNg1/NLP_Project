 The  FOIL method helps you remember to first multiply the first terms, then the outer terms, then the inner terms, then the last terms. When dividing a fraction by a fraction, this should be your last step after cancelling terms in the numerator and denominator.For example, if you are simplifying the expression y(x+3)4yx−2{\displaystyle {\frac {\frac {y(x+3)}{4}}{\frac {y}{x-2}}}}, after taking the reciprocal and combining terms, you end up with the expression y(x+3)(x−2)4y{\displaystyle {\frac {y(x+3)(x-2)}{4y}}}. First, cancel the y{\displaystyle y} in the numerator and denominator, then multiply the binomials using the FOIL method:y(x+3)(x−2)4y{\displaystyle {\frac {{\cancel {y}}(x+3)(x-2)}{4{\cancel {y}}}}}(x+3)(x−2)4{\displaystyle {\frac {(x+3)(x-2)}{4}}}x2−2x+3x−64{\displaystyle {\frac {x^{2}-2x+3x-6}{4}}}x2+x−64{\displaystyle {\frac {x^{2}+x-6}{4}}}


, You can use the distributive property to factor out a term. This might help you cancel terms. Conversely, you can use the distributive property to multiply a term into a binomial when you are simplifying your expressionFor example, if you are simplifying the expression 2x+4y2yx{\displaystyle {\frac {\frac {2x+4}{y}}{\frac {2y}{x}}}}, after taking the reciprocal and combining terms, you end up with the expression x(2x+4)2y(y){\displaystyle {\frac {x(2x+4)}{2y(y)}}}. First, factor out a 2 from 2x+4{\displaystyle 2x+4}. Then you can cancel a 2 from the numerator and denominator. Then, simplify the expression by completing the multiplication:(x)(2)(x+2)2y(y){\displaystyle {\frac {(x)(2)(x+2)}{2y(y)}}}(x)(2)(x+2)2y(y){\displaystyle {\frac {(x){\cancel {(2)}}(x+2)}{{\cancel {2}}y(y)}}}(x)(x+2)y(y){\displaystyle {\frac {(x)(x+2)}{y(y)}}}(x2+2x)y2{\displaystyle {\frac {(x^{2}+2x)}{y^{2}}}}


, You will need to do this if the numerator or denominator of the complex fraction contains a whole number being added or subtracted to a fraction. Remember that to add or subtract fractions, the fractions need to have the same denominator. So, to turn a whole number in the top or bottom of a complex fraction into a fraction, multiply it by xx{\displaystyle {\frac {x}{x}}}, where x{\displaystyle x} is the denominator of the fraction it is being added to or subtracted from.For example, if you have 2+3y5y2{\displaystyle {\frac {2+{\frac {3}{y}}}{\frac {5}{y^{2}}}}}, you would change the 2 into a fraction by multiplying it by yy{\displaystyle {\frac {y}{y}}}:2+3y5y2{\displaystyle {\frac {2+{\frac {3}{y}}}{\frac {5}{y^{2}}}}}2yy+3y5y2{\displaystyle {\frac {{\frac {2y}{y}}+{\frac {3}{y}}}{\frac {5}{y^{2}}}}}2y+3y5y2{\displaystyle {\frac {\frac {2y+3}{y}}{\frac {5}{y^{2}}}}}2y+3y÷5y2{\displaystyle {\frac {2y+3}{y}}\div {\frac {5}{y^{2}}}}2y+3y×y25{\displaystyle {\frac {2y+3}{y}}\times {\frac {y^{2}}{5}}}y2(2y+3)5y{\displaystyle {\frac {y^{2}(2y+3)}{5y}}}y2(2y+3)5y{\displaystyle {\frac {y^{\cancel {2}}(2y+3)}{5{\cancel {y}}}}}y(2y+3)5{\displaystyle {\frac {y(2y+3)}{5}}}2y2+3y5{\displaystyle {\frac {2y^{2}+3y}{5}}}

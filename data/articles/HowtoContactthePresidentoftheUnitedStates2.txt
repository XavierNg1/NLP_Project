 You may love the President, or you may hate the President. Regardless of your sentiments, or the purpose of your letter—be it condemnation or praise—remember that you're writing to the leader of the United States, and arguably the most powerful single person on the planet.


Note, the White House requests that you either type your letter on an 8-1/2 by 11 inch sheet of paper, or if you hand-write it, use ink and your most legible handwriting.
Format it as you would a business letter, or any formal communication:
Your name and address at the top right, including email address, with the date written out below that.
Below your name and address, and on the left side, put the following:
The President
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, DC 20500
Salutation: Dear Mr. President
Write an honest, but respectful letter, stating your thoughts clearly and reasonably. This will be especially useful if you want your letter to actually be read. Unless you have a fondness for men in black, unmarked helicopters, and looking at the business end of a gun, don't include any threats—overt or otherwise.
Close: Most Respectfully,
Sign your name.
 Fold your letter, and slide it into the envelope.


Write the address of the White House as shown below:
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, DC 20500
Add your return address on the top left.
 Seal the envelope and take it to your nearest Post Office or letter carrier.

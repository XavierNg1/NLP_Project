 It will be much easier to complete the tape job with your foot off the ground. Rest it on a short stool or a chair, or sit on a table and hang your foot off the edge.


It is usually easier to have someone else tape your leg, as they can focus on taping and you can focus on keeping your ankle still.;
, Taping your foot protects it from moving too quickly and furthering any injuries. You want to tape it at a 90-degree angle so that you can move your foot up and down slightly, but still protect you ankle and ligaments from extreme movements

, These pads, often sold in outdoor stores to prevent blisters while hiking, will keep the tape from rubbing against your skin and causing painful blisters. Place a 2-4 inch pad on the front and back of you ankle – roughly at the places where your foot meets the edge of a pair of sneakers.


Two 2x2 inch squares of gauze work well if you do not have pads.
You can buy large adhesive pads, like Moleskins, and use kitchen scissors to cut them into the right shape.
 Pre-wrap is stretchy, soft gauze that protects your skin and hair from tape. Starting near the ball of your foot (the pads of skin right before your toes), wrap around your foot in pre-wrap, working towards your ankle so that every layer slightly overlaps the last one. Stop wrapping just under your calf muscle, 4-5 inches above your ankle bone. Think about "mummifying" your foot.


Aim to cover up most of your skin to protect it from the tape so that it cannot pull out hair when you need to remove it.
Your heel will often be uncovered, but that’s okay – there is no hair to pull off and your skin is tough.
 If you wrapped it tightly enough you can also tuck the ends of the strip into the wrap around your ankle. Use 3-4 pieces of 1-1/4 inch athletic tape to keep the pre-wrap in place.


Athletic tape looks like masking tape, with small holes in the surface to help your skin breathe. It is available at most sporting good stores.

 Make sure your back is straight and your feet are shoulder length apart.Complete knuckle pushups on a soft surface like carpet, a workout mat, or even grass. Over time, once these surfaces feel comfortable and are not challenging anymore, you can do knuckle pushups on a hard floor or concrete.;
, While still in the pushup position, make a fist with each hand one at a time, placing each fist on the floor. You will use your fists to hold up your body instead of your palms. Focus on placing your body weight mostly on the first two knuckles.


You can also do fingertip pushups if knuckle pushups are easy for you.If you can do both knuckle and fingertip pushups, alternate between the two.
 Lower your body until it almost touches the ground and push your body back up, using your knuckles to hold your weight the entire time. This may hurt at first and will irritate your knuckles, so only do 80% of the pushups you would normally do, and complete these on a soft surface.









For example, if you usually do 100 pushups, only do 80, and if you do 80 pushups normally, only do 64.
Increase the amount of knuckle pushups with each work out.
If your knuckles are excessively sore, do not complete more knuckle pushups until they heal, up to 2 weeks.
 Place your thumbs on the ground to help stabilize your body if you are falling over or feel very wobbly.

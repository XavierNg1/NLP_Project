 This should be a last resort, since the chemicals are tough on hair and could cause brittleness and split ends to occur. If you dyed your hair a dark color, chemical dye remover can lighten it up. Follow the instructions on the package to treat your hair with dye remover, then rinse it out and examine the results. Repeat if necessary.


Test the dye remover on a discreet lock of hair before using it on your whole head.
Chemical dye remover doesn't work on hair that has been dyed lighter; it only works to remove darker colors.
Do a deep conditioning treatment on your hair to restore it to health after using a dye remover.
 This is a natural way to remove dark color from your hair. Make a paste with 1/2 cup of baking soda and 1/2 cup water. Massage it into your hair and let it sit for 15 minutes, then rinse with hot water. Repeat as many times as you'd like until you've achieved the color you want.


Condition your hair well after using baking soda, since it strips your hair of its natural oils.
 This must be used within 30 minutes of the color application.


Mix together 1 tablespoon bleach powder, 25 milliliters (0.85  fl oz) 40 vol/6% peroxide, and a bit of shampoo.
Apply the color stripper to wet hair. Use as you'd use normal shampoo.
Emulsify and rub the hair for approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Take great care not to get it in your eyes!
Use a mirror and check to see the color lifting.
Rinse well. Towel dry. Apply conditioner or treatment.

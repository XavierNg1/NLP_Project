 Use soap and water to remove any dirt, grime, or other substances that may prevent the wax from bonding to your hair. Rinse off afterward. Then dry your skin thoroughly, since any remaining water may thin the wax and weaken its bond with the fabric.Additionally, try dusting your skin with baby powder after drying. This will soak up any lingering moisture in your skin that might interfere with the wax bonding., If you’ve been shaving instead of using other forms of wax, be patient. Give your hair a chance to grow longer so it’s easier to remove when waxing. Wait at least a week or two after shaving before switching to waxing.After repeated waxes, you’ll only have to wait for your hair to grow about a centimeter long before doing it again.
 If you’re new to waxing, anticipate having to do it more often than people who have been doing it for a while. After your first wax, inspect your skin for hair growth. Younger hairs may have been too short for the wax to bond to the first time, so wax again as they grow out.Individual hairs fall out naturally, so each regrowth may be at a different stage than those around it. This means you have to wax numerous times the first few weeks.
Over time, the roots will lose their strength, at which point they won’t need to grow as long. As this happens, each wax should remove more hairs at once, so you won’t have to do it quite so often.

 Original stock compensation is recorded according to when the stocks or options become vested (available to the employee). The specifics of when this occurs are specific to individual employee stock compensation plans and are created at the discretion of the company. The entries made on the vesting date(s) are a debit to Compensation Expense and a credit to Additional Paid-In Capital, Stock Options, both for the fair value of the vested options or stocks.

For example, imagine that an employee is granted a stock option plan on the first day of 2014 that gives them the option to purchase 1,000 shares of stock after a 2-year vesting period. 

The options included in the plan are valued at $35,000 through the use of a fair value model. 

The entries made on the vesting date, which would be the last day of 2015 (12/31/2015) are a debit of $35,000 to Compensation Expense and a Credit of $35,000 to Additional Paid-In Capital, Stock Options., All other entries for stock compensation plans will likely be made on the expiration date. Any exercised options will be recorded to reflect the increase in cash and change in common stock and options accounts. Continuing with the previous example, imagine that the employee decides to exercise 400 of his options. This would mean that he buys 400 shares of the stock at the option price.

The option price is $50, this would represent $20,000 (400×$50{\displaystyle 400\times \$50}) in cash coming in to the company. In addition, it would represent 40 percent (400 of 1000 total) of the stock options originally granted leaving the company. 

However, this also means that the common stock shares created in the purchase must be recorded. This will be done at the par value. So, if the par value of the shares is $5, this would mean that the company has gained $2,000 ($5×400{\displaystyle \$5\times 400}) in common stock. 

This transaction would be recorded at the expiration date of the options as a debit to Cash for $20,000, a debit to Additional Paid-In Capital, Stock Options, for $14,000, a credit to Common Stock for $2,000, and, finally, a balancing credit to Additional Paid-In Capital, Common Stock, for $32,000.The balancing entry at the end represents the difference between the debits to Cash and Stock Options ($34,000 total) and the common stock credit ($2,000).
 At the expiration date, any unexercised options are also recorded. In this case, having exercised 40 percent of their options over the vesting period, the employee has elected not to exercise the remaining 60 percent. This means that 60 percent of the original $35,000 value, or $21,000, will be written off as expired stock options. Specifically, a debit to Additional Paid-In Capital, Stock Options, will be made along with a credit to Additional Paid-In Capital, Expired Stock Options, both for the $21,000 fair value of the expired options., How financial statements are presented is your prerogative, but you must include all stock-based compensation when distributing statements to your stockholders. Stock compensation should be recorded as an expense on the income statement. However, stock compensation expenses must also be included on the company's balance sheet and statement of cash flows.

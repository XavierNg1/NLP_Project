 If SugarSync is already running, you can see it from the system or notification tray. Skip this step if SugarSync is already running; otherwise, click on the Start menu and find the program under All Programs.


You will be asked to log in using your SugarSync account.
 From the system or notification tray, click on the SugarSync icon. It is the one with the hummingbird. The program’s system menu will appear. Click on “SugarSync File Manager” from here.
 A list of SugarSync folders, places, and all connected computers and devices under your SugarSync account will be displayed on the left panel.
 The folder and file directory of the selected item will be displayed on the right window.


Only the files synced with your SugarSync account will be accessible. All other files under the connected computers and devices are not.
 Navigate through the folders until you see the file you want to open. Open the file by double-clicking on it. Work on the file as you normally will on any similar file on your computer.
 Once you’re done, save the file by pressing Ctrl + S. It will be automatically synced with your SugarSync account, including the original computer where it came from.

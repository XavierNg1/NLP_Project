 Tell only invited guests and other needed people who will not let the guest of honor find out. One of the worst things to do before a surprise party is telling people. You can tell a few friends you trust so they can help you but no blabbermouths. Make sure when the person you are throwing the party for doesn't see any decorations beforehand. Keep it all top secret!;
, Make sure you keep the person as far away from the party location as possible until party time!

, When the person shows up at the party you don't want balloons outside or a sign that says 'HONK, TODAY IS _____'S _TH BIRTHDAY!' Make sure you keep the shades shut when the guest arrives....and don't forget to hide!

, What's a party without some balloons? Buy some balloons you can blow up yourself or get a whole bunch from the grocery store. Confetti is a must! Nothing better than having confetti thrown in your face as you walk inside your party! Also make sure you get enough banners, streamers, cake, punch/soda, ice cream. And make sure it's all according to color.
 What's a party without your friends or loved ones? Invite some people and in the invitations tell them to keep it a secret. Also if your guests are driving over to the party it wouldn't hurt to hide the cars or even walk over if you are close enough.
 A party is no fun without some games and party favors. It really depends on who you are throwing the party for. If it's a child , have some small toys as favors and some fun games like pin the tail on the donkey, if its affordable it wouldn't hurt to get a clown. For a teen/adult party a great favor would be a gift card to a store or restaurant.
, When they hit the door yell SURPRISE!

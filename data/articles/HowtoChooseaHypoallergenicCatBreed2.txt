 Brushing your cat reduces the amount of hair and dander they leave around your home. Try brushing your cat daily if possible. You can do it less if you'd like, but make sure to do it frequently for it to be effective.For shorthaired cats, try using a metal comb or rubber brush. The rubber brush will especially help remove dead hair. Work in the direction the fur goes, brushing from the top of the cat's head to the tip of the tail, taking it section by section.It can help to start with a metal comb or bristle brush and follow up with a rubber brush to help remove the dead hair.For longhaired cats, look for a wider spaced bristle brush, and try following up with a rubber brush.
If you have a cat that's wired-hair or curly, wire-pin brushes work well. They also work on medium- and longhaired cats.For both shorthaired and longhaired cats with thick coats, start by brushing against the grain of the fur, then going back over it moving in the direction of the fur., Bathing your cat can reduce allergens like dander and saliva. However, you'd have to do it fairly often (once a day). Bathing your cat this often will not be a pleasant experience for your cat, and it will likely dry out their skin. Instead, you can try quick-cleaning wipes to rub down your cat each day. You can find specially formulated wipes at the pet store or online., When you come in contact with the cat, it's important to wash your hands afterwards. That way, you won't spread the allergens to your face, including your nose, mouth, and eyes, which is where the allergens will cause the most damage., While it may be cats that you're allergic to, you could also be allergic to what a cat brings in from the outside if it's an outdoor cat. Having yourself tested for allergies will help you determine just what allergies you have, so you can make adjustments. For instance, maybe you'll just want to keep your cat indoors (which is healthier for the cat anyway).

 Women may want to draw attention to their shoulders and legs to give an illusion of a narrower waist. You can wear A line dresses, strapless tops with boot cut pants, or slim fitting pants with a larger, loose top that is gathered at the waist.Men will want to give a balance of upper body bulk by wearing open neck shirts, but also by wearing slim-fitting pants.


Pants with wide waist bands or skirts with detail will give a curvier look for your lower body.
Men should always look for 'slim fit' suits. Go with suits that have structure and will give the illusion of a slightly broader chest and shoulders.
 In women, this body type tends to be athletic. If that’s the case, wearing heels with shorts and skirts will highlight your legs and flatter your figure. If you’re not comfortable wearing heels, try to practice wearing them a few times a week. Make sure you’re walking with your back straight. When you take a step, “roll” your hips to shift your weight from one leg to another.
 Tight shirts that highlight your waist are uncomplimentary on a rectangle body type and can make you appear bulky. Similarly, floor-length dresses and skirts that hang loosely to the floor can be unflattering. Instead, wear A-line dresses or mini-skirts to highlight your legs and add curves to your silhouette.

 The layer closest to your skin should be a moisture-wicking material that will keep you dry as you sweat. It should also be form fitting to help insulate your body. Avoid cotton, as it can become damp from your sweat. Instead, look for shirts that are made of:


Wool
Polyester
Wool/Polyester mixPolypropylene;
, The middle layer can be a pullover sweater, a front-zipping jacket, or a vest. It should be warm and insulating while still allowing your body to breathe. Fleece is a good middle layer as it is warm and soft like wool but much lighter.If you live in an area that is extremely cold, you may decide to wear wool. Be aware that it is much heavier, and it may be more burdensome as you exercise.
 The outermost layer should be a waterproof coat. You may want to look for one that has zipper vents, which you can open to air out your armpits. Unless you live in an extremely cold area, you may only need a light shell or a raincoat for this layer.Some good materials for the outer layer include:


Nylon
Gore-Tex

, You should not wear shorts during the wintertime. Although you can warm up through exercise, it may not be sufficient to prevent cold related conditions like hypothermia. Wear long pants, leggings, exercise tights, or yoga pants when exercising outside.


If it is dry outside, you might choose a polyester blend or cotton for your pants.
If it is wet or snowy, you might opt for a waterproof bottom.
If you run, you may want to look for thermal running tights.
 As it can get dark early in winter, you want to make sure that you are visible to motorists as you exercise. When buying fitness clothing, look for outer layers that have reflective coloring, such as metallic orange or silver.If you cannot find reflective winter clothing, you can also look for clip-on LED lights or reflective arm bands, belts, and shoe clips.

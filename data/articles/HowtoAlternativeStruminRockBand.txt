 Normal strumming usually involves pressing down on the strum bar with your thumb to strum a note, or much more rarely, using your fingers to strum upward, like how one would play on a bass guitar.;
, Play it just one speed notch underneath what is comfortable for you.
 Hold the strum bar with your thumb and index fingers, and strum up and down in a pattern, typically Down Up Down Up Down Up Down Up... well, you understand.
 You should always practice songs like this if you're having difficulty. Some people-like the author-are too hyper to alternative strum a song to the point of a x4 multiplier or x6 multiplier on the first try. If you're like that, Practice Mode is a must.

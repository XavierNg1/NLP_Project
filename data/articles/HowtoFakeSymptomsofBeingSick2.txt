 A fever is a classic illness to fake, since they often imply that you are contagious and the best treatment is usually bed rest. People with fevers have faces and foreheads that are usually hot, though they themselves feel cold. There are a number of ways to give yourself the appearance of a feverish face.


Take a hot shower without getting your hair wet.






Blow on your face with a blow dryer.






Rub water on your face to make it seem sweaty.






Heat your face for a few minutes with a heating pad or hot water bottle when no one is looking.






Rub your face vigorously with your hands.






Lay down on your back with your head hanging off the edge of your bed so that all the blood flows to it.
 They will make you sweat, but people will think you are cold too. Pretend to shiver, no matter how much you bundle yourself up. A cold sweat is one important symptom of a cold or fever.
 If a parent or nurse leaves you alone with a thermometer in your mouth, there are a few things you can do to give yourself an artificially high temperature. Just make sure you don't get it too highâ€”it will either be obvious that you faked the results or they will take you to the doctor or hospital to treat your dangerously high temperature.


Drink hot water before putting the thermometer in your mouth.






Touch the thermometer to a hot light bulb for a second.






Shake the thermometer vigorously by the metal tip. This will push the mercury out towards the high end of the thermometer. Of course, this doesn't work with digital thermometers.

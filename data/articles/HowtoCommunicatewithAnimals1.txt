 Animals will use many parts of their bodies to convey various feelings. Being observant to how your pet uses his body can let you know if he’s feeling playful, sick, or maybe even angry. For example, your horse’s eyes can indicate that he is alert (fully open), drowsy (half open), or having problems with one eye (problem eye stays shut).Your dog may narrow his eyes and stare at you to indicate that is feeling aggressive.He may also avoid eye contact with you to show that he is submissive or showing deference to you.
Your cat’s ears may go back if he is feeling particularly anxious about something.
Dogs and horses will prick their ears up and slightly forward to indicate concentration.Your dog may hold his mouth slightly open, without showing his teeth, to indicate that he is feeling relaxed yet alert.;
, Just like the eyes, ears, and face, your pet’s legs and tail can provide helpful insight about how he’s feeling. For example, your horse may slowly his flick his tail to swish away flies, but may flick it more quickly to convey anger or annoyance.Similar to horses, cats will flick their tails quickly to indicate anger.When your dog is holding his tail at a position that is either level to, or slightly lower than, his body, he is showing that he is feeling friendly.Your horse can use his legs to buck and show that he is feeling playful. However, bucking could also convey uncertainty., Your pet can also communicate with you through the ways in which he positions and moves his body. For example, if your dog suddenly freezes and tenses his body, he could be conveying that he is uncertain about something or possibly preparing to attack.If your horse is walking very stiffly, he may be stressed, nervous, or in pain.If you have a small pocket pet, such as a guinea pig, you may notice that he is particularly fidgety if he is feeling irritable or agitated.
If your cat is lying on his back, he may be conveying two different things: relaxation (usually accompanied by a purr) or anger (usually accompanied by a growl).

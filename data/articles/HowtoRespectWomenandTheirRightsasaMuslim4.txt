"The person who is put to a test because of the birth of the daughters & then he treats them generously, they will become a means of rescue for him from hell".
"A person is very lucky whose first child is a daughter".
"The one who brought up two girls till they attained their maturity, will appear along with me on the Resurrection Day... saying this Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) jointed & raised his fingers".
 Teach them to respect all life, including their own, and stand up against evil. Help them grow into bright, capable women who will succeed in life.
 An educated daughter can understand the world, choose a good husband and/or job, and make a difference in the world. Send your daughter to a school where she will learn to be a leader. This is the easiest way to guarantee her happiness.
 Ask your young children what sort of job they would like. (Doctor? Computer programmer? Lawyer? Writer?) Ask teenage daughters about their opinions on the news, the economy, and what they are studying in school. When they learn that their opinions are important, they will work harder and become more prepared for work someday.


Encourage your daughters' hobbies. Bring home pencils for a daughter who likes to draw, dolls for a daughter who likes to play house, and toy circuit boards for a daughter who likes engineering. Find library books about their favorite things.
 If your daughters must wash dishes, make your sons wash them too, or have your sons clean the kitchen. Teach them that their gender does not mean they have to work while their brothers play.], How soon do they want to marry (if at all)? Do they have their eye on a particular man? What do they look for in a man, and what do they think will make them happy? Their husband will influence the rest of their lives, so it is important that they know what they want.


Some daughters may be homosexual or bisexual. Show them your love and acceptance.
 This will help your daughters live in a better world.

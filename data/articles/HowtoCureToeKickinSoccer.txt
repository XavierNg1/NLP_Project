 A child doesnâ€™t change anything about their natural walking or running stride when they first start to kick a soccer ball. It is almost like the soccer ball just happens to get in the way of their natural stride. As we walk or run as humans our toe naturally points forward as it moves forward. Keeping the toe down would cause us to walk or run looking like a Clydesdale horse. Also, when we bring our leg forward there is VERY little clearance between the bottom of the foot and the ground. Pointing the toe down will cause it to hit the ground, often causing serious injury.;
,, The leg comes back behind the player, returns OUT to the ball and then swings back around in front. The ball is struck with the "sweet spot" which is slightly on the inside of our foot, just above the big toe.
 The player MUST maintain eye contact on the ball while performing the kick.
, Then hold a soccer ball over your foot. Let it fall and watch where it strikes your foot. It will hit the very top of your foot. This is where you strike the ball with a straight kick.
 The laces travel directly towards your target and the foot is not tilted or angled in any way.
 It does not come from behind you or wrap around you in the front after the kick.
, Allow your leg to bend at the knee, but do not allow your toe position to change. This will cause your toe to "point to the sky" when it reaches the fully back position. Now allow your leg to swing forward maintaining the bend in your knee and the toe down position.
 DO NOT perform them at full speed until the soccer player has learn how to shorten their leg by maintaining the bend in their leg and raising their hip slightly. You can also get more info about plant foot positioning at Blast The Ball.

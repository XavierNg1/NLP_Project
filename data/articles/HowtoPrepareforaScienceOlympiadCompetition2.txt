 Learning the rules for each event and for each level, i.e., regional, state, or national, is crucial to successfully completing an event. Ensure that you have an up-to-date handbook by checking for the year at the bottom of the page next to the page number. The handbook will advise you on what materials to bring, like goggles or a lab coat, as well as what materials you cannot bring.
 Once you have acquired all your studying materials, set up regular meetings with your team and teammates. These meetings should be weekly meetings. Teamwork skills are very important. Therefore, practice working as a team, and learn to trust your partner’s skills.


Learn to trust your partner’s skills by practicing with them regularly. By practicing with each other, you will be able to assess each of your strengths and weaknesses. Adjust your partnership relative to you and your partner’s strengths and weaknesses. For example, if one of you excels at identifying muscle groups, while the other excels at writing, adjust your partnership accordingly.
Practice with sample questions from your test packets, field guides, and training guides.
 Remember that events are timed. In order to be successful at the competition, practice under timed conditions. Have your teammate time you as you practice completing a task, and vice versa. Come up with sample questions and stations in order to practice completing these tasks on time.

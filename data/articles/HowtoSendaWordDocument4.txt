 If your Word document is located in your Google Drive, it’s easy to share it with others. Accessing your Drive is different depending on your platform:Mobile: Launch the Google Drive app on your device.
Desktop: Log in to http://drive.google.com in your web browser.
 If you don’t see it in the main folder, you may have to look in some of the subfolders.


If you haven’t yet uploaded the document from your computer, click New > File Upload, and then double-click the Word document.,,


Another way to do this is to single-click the document and then click the Share icon (the outline of a person’s head with a plus sign.)

, If this person is one of your Google contacts, you can just start typing their name and then select the correct person from the search results.
 By default, Drive gives the person permission to edit the document in your Google Drive.


Leave this alone if you’re sharing the document with someone and you both plan to make edits.
, An email will be sent to the recipient containing information on how to access the document. They’ll be able to view it online or download it to their computer.

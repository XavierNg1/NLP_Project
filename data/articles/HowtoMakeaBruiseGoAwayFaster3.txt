 Some painkillers are anti-inflammatory and can help reduce pain as well as swelling. However, avoid aspirin, as it may thin your blood and make the bruise worse.
 Arnica is an herb that reduces inflammation and can help reduce the appearance of bruises quickly. It is available in cream or gel form at most drug stores. Apply a coating to the affected area twice daily until the bruise goes away.
 If you have the stomach for it, and you can find a holistic medicine supply store that sells live leeches, you can place a live leech directly on the bruise. It will suck the blood off the top layer of the bruise immediately. Because the leech's saliva is somewhat numbing, you won't feel any discomfort during this process.

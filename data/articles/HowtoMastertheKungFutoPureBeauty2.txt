 Your hair is one of the most important things that have to do with outer beauty. Treat it well. First, you need to get the right conditioner and shampoo. If your hair's thin, purchase products specifically for thickening or volume. If you've got dandruff, there are many shampoo options to cure it!


Generously squeeze some shampoo onto the palm of your hand. Lather it from your scalp to the tips of your hair until a thick foam appears, then rinse it out thoroughly and repeat; unless the bottle states to leave it in for a designated time first. Get the same amount of conditioner (or less, if your hair is oily!) and do the same. While it is still in your hair, carefully run a wide-toothed comb through it. Rinse and blow dry.
 Charm is very important; like hair. Develop good charisma. The better you can talk to people, the better you are as a person, which kind of falls into the inner beauty category. Also, remember that no makeup is much better then a bad makeup application. If you are unsure on how well you did your makeup, ask someone you trust for a review.
 How you smell is who you are! If you smell terrible, what does that say about yourself? "I'm someone you surely don't want to be around", that's what it says! Find a good perfume, an anti-perspirant deodorant and you're on your way!

, Have well-fitting clothes. If you are rounder, go for flow. Skinnier? Aim for a little bit of tightness. Also, select good colors. Ones that bring out your eyes are great finds! Pat yourself on the back and walk out of the store with your head held high.

 According to the American Dental Association, it doesn't matter whether you use mouthwash before or after brushing - both are equally effective. The more important thing is to use good quality mouthwash., You can carry a little bottle of mouthwash with you during the day to refresh your breath after meals. If you have a problem with bad breath, this can be a good alternative to popping breath mints all day long.
 Mouthwash is meant to be a supplement to other oral hygiene practices - not a replacement. Make sure you continue to brush and floss your teeth as recommended by your dentist. In most cases you should brush twice a day and floss once. Use mouthwash every time you brush, or just in the morning or at night - it's your choice.
 If you're using mouthwash in an attempt to treat gingivitis, chronic bad breath, or cavities, you should make an appointment with your dentist to make sure you're using the right mouthwash. Mouthwash alone may not be effective enough to treat the problem you're dealing with, so it's important to get dental care before things get worse.

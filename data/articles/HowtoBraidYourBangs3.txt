 Use a comb to divide your bangs from the rest of your hair. Comb through your bangs to remove any snarls or kinks.


If you are in a pinch, use your fingers instead of a comb.
 Pull your bangs straight up from your head. Twist the hair away from your face. Twisting your bangs will ensure that your braid will rest along your hairline instead of across your forehead. Divide your bangs into three equal sections and then proceed to braid your hair. Stop once the braid is 4 to 5 inches long.
 With one hand, hold the braid in place against your head; with the other hand, insert one bobby pin downwards through the braid. Retrieve a second bobby pin and insert it into the braid so that it forms an “X” with the first pin. This will prevent the pins from slipping.

 Based on your research, make a list of camps that fit most of your criteria.
 Go to the websites of your targeted camps (or call, if the information is not available online) to find out if and when they will be hiring. Note application due dates and any other pertinent information.
 If you attended a great summer camp as a kid and want an opportunity to work there, contact a representative directly. There may still be people there who would recognize you! They may offer you a job or invite you to apply.
 Some camps have rules and regulations about who can work there or who can work in specific jobs. This is information that you need. It is pointless, for example, to apply for a job that requires nursing certification if you are not a nurse. Age may also be a factor: some camps require counselors to be 16, 17, or 18. Call, email, or check the camp website to determine what the regulations are for a particular camp.
 Camps want to hire individuals who can pass a background check and provide excellent references. Seek references from people who know you well and are not family members; make sure you choose people who will provide positive information about your character and skills. Potential referees include:


teachers
coaches
counselors
former employers

, Once you have completed your research, developed a list of target camps, and checked available jobs, go ahead and apply. Follow application instructions carefully. Good luck!

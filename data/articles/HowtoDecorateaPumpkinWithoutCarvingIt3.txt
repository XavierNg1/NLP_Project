 Both ordinary stickers and scrapbook stickers will work.


You can use geometric shapes, like triangles and circles, to create faces or patterns.
Stickers in the shapes of eyes, mouths, and noses can be used to create faces.
Autumn-themed stickers, like leaves, can be used to create a design the will last for the entire season.
 Spread clear crafting glue over the surface of the pumpkin before attaching sheets of gold leaf onto the surface. Smooth the leaf onto the surface with a soft cloth.


You can also use broken pieces of gold and silver leaf to create a more aged, visually interesting contrast., Use construction paper to cut out pictures or shapes and adhere those cutouts to the pumpkin with crafting glue.


Alternatively, you could print out Halloween pictures or autumn designs from your computer and adhere those to the pumpkin instead of making your own from construction paper.
 If you painted or otherwise created a face for your pumpkin, you could find a cheap Halloween wig or hat to decorate the top of the “head” with.


Many wigs are available in stores that sell Halloween costumes.
You could use a “witch” hat to emphasize a Halloween theme, or you could use an ordinary cap or knit hat to create a more casual look.



Cut out "leaves" of tissue paper that are the same height as your pumpkin, as measured from bottom to stem. The leaves should be cut from various patterns and colors of tissue paper.
Apply a thick line of mod podge to the pumpkin and adhere a leaf of tissue paper to it.
Continue applying mod podge and tissue paper. Alternate the patterns and colors of the tissue paper as you work your way around the pumpkin.
 Stick mums or other autumn flowers in the pumpkin, covering the entire surface.The flowers can be real or fake.
Poke a hole in the side of the pumpkin using an awl or other pointed tool. Insert the stem of one flower into the hole. Repeat this procedure until the entire pumpkin is covered in flowers.

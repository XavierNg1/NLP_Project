 Run water over the perfume stain on the silk or triacetate. Though silk and triacetate are not very absorbent materials, try to saturate the stained area with water. Water stops fresh stains from setting, and helps old stains separate from the fabric so that they can get removed.
 After flushing with water, drop on a few drops of glycerin and use your finger to gently dap the glycerin to cover the stained area.Glycerin helps to soften even old stains so that they can be removed.
 After you add the glycerin to the stain, run the fabric under water and rinse well, gently wiping over the stain with your finger. After rinsing, you should see that some or all of the perfume stain has been removed., If the glycerin didn’t fully remove the stain, make a solution of white vinegar by using a one to one ratio of water and white vinegar. Then add a small amount of the solution to a cloth or sponge and blot at the stain, starting at the center of the stain and working out., If the glycerin and vinegar didn’t work to remove the stain, add a couple of drops of denatured alcohol to a cheesecloth pad or to a sponge. Then use a patting motion to dab at the stain with the denatured alcohol.Denatured alcohol is poisonous when ingested, so be extremely careful when using it and store it out of reach of children.
 After you have removed the stain from your silk, flush the garment with water to remove any remnants of the cleaning agents you used. Then hang your silk garment out to dry.

, When choosing a face wash, choose one that is gentle and is plant-oil based. Look for a cleanser labeled as “non-comedogenic,” which means it doesn’t encourage new acne.Try glycerin, grapeseed oil, hempseed oil, and sunflower oil, as well as others. Oils are the best to use to absorb and dissolve other oils.You can also use castor oil , calendula oil, or argan oil.Also try heating shea butter until it has a smooth, oil-like consistency.Try products from Neutrogena, Cetaphil, and Olay. There are also many store brand products that are non-comedogenic. Check the label.

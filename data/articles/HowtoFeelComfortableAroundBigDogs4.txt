 With a friend or a family member, visit a nearby dog park. You do not need to go inside the dog park. Instead, you can stand outside of the park. Watch how the dogs interact with each other and the people. Particularly, watch the larger dogs. Observe how their interactions aren't any different than the interactions medium and small dogs have.Bring some dog treats with you. Try giving a large dog a treat through the fence if their owner allows. You can also have your friend give the dog the treat. Watch how the dog interacts with your friend. Then, try to give the dog a treat.
 To overcome your fear of large dogs, try exposing yourself to small or medium dogs first. By becoming comfortable with small and medium dogs, you can learn how to interact and be more comfortable around bigger dogs.Instead of meeting large puppies, expose yourself to larger dogs that are older and more mature. Older dogs are relaxed, and are typically less interested in interacting with other people. For example, they are less likely to run up to you, jump on you, and follow you around.
 Breathing and relaxation techniques will help you regain control of your emotions when you are in the moment. Also, come up with a mantra that you can repeat to yourself to calm your nerves.When you feel your body becoming tense and your heartbeat growing faster, relax your shoulders and begin to breathe in and out. Instead of focusing on the dog, focus on your breathing. Inhale, hold your breathe for a couple seconds, and then exhale.
Repeat a positive mantra to yourself, like, "I am in control and I am not afraid of dogs. I know how to handle dogs."

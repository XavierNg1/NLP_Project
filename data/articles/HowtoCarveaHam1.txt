 Take a large knife and trim off two or three slices from the thin side of the ham, cutting parallel to its length. Then turn the ham so it rests on the flat surface you just created by trimming off the slices.

Use a very sharp knife. Having a sharp knife will help you to cut your ham in thin, perfect slices.
Be sure the knife is long enough to cut through the width of the ham and use long smooth strokes to slice the ham more easily.;
, Pierce the top of the ham with a large fork and insert the fork as far down into the meat as you can. If you hit the bone right away, try moving the fork slightly up or to either side and insert it again. Once the tines are all the way inside the ham, you should have a nice stable handle to hold while making your cuts., Hold the ham with a large fork, start slicing at the shank end (which should be more pointed/tapered than the butt end). Cut thin, vertical slices across the ham, sinking the knife all the way down to the bone for maximum effect., Once the slices are cut, make a horizontal cut that is parallel to the bone. This will release the slices you've made. Place these slices on a serving platter. Turn the ham and continue carve slices using this method until there is no meat left on the bone.

Only carve the ham that you need to serve. Leave the remainder on the bone so that it stays warm and retains more of its juiciness.
Be sure to hang on to the ham bone and any scraps. You can use them to make a delicious soup.

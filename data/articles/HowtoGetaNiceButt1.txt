 The following are the best butt-friendly gym exercises:


Do the elliptical. If you cannot run on the treadmill, then the elliptical is the next best bet. It allows you many of the same benefits, while being low-impact. Also, choose a program that increases intensity or incline in intervals.
Choose a mountain trail or hill program on the treadmill. Jogging, not walking, on the treadmill will activate the most gluteal muscles. In addition, using a program with an incline will work more muscles in your legs, hips and butt.
Do the stair climber. Workout for over 20 minutes on the stair climber. Make sure you choose an interval-based workout, so that the intensity changes and you burn more fat.;
, The following are good options outside the gym:


Jumping rope. Jump rope in 1 to 2 minute intervals, rest for 30 seconds, then jump again for 2 to 5 more sets.
 Find a stadium or long set of stairs. Run up the stairs and down 10 times.


Create sets by taking the stairs 1 at a time the first time, 2 at a time the second time and 3 at a time the third time. Then, repeat.
Jog or hike up hills. Use those outdoor trails to your advantage. Take them as fast as you can for a buttock and heart-healthy burn.



Barre or booty barre is especially designed to target your hips, thighs and buttocks. Although it is a total-body workout, the number of squats and lunges are perfect for people looking to firm the butt and lose weight.
Do step aerobics. Most gyms and some private studios offer 45 to 60 minute classes that will firm your butt.
Try Zumba or Oula. Dancing is a great workout for the lower body, and these workouts incorporate interval training and fat burning.

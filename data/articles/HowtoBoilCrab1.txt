 While we do not recommend buying frozen crab - the taste won't be as strong - if you chose a frozen crab it needs to thaw. You can thaw it by placing it whole in a sink of cool water. You don't want to leave your crab in the water too long - 15 to 20 minutes should be sufficient., The first thing you want to do with crab is give it a good scrub down. Crabs are not known to be hygienic animals, and the waters where they are caught are usually not very clean. It's recommended you use a scrubbing brush with a handle, as this tool is easy to maneuver and can be used with a fair amount of force.


Wear a pair of dish gloves, especially if your crab is live. It will likely try to fight back by pinching and flailing and the gloves can protect your hands.
Dump the crab in the sink. If you have more than one crab, clean them one at a time. If your crab is live, try to make sure it's back is turned to you so it does not attack. You can do this by distracting the crab or, if you're brave enough, simply turning it around by force.
Turn on the water with one hand and pin the crab with the other. Crabs are fairly strong. If your crab is live, do not hesitate to use the full force of your body to restrain it.
Scrub the top part of your crab with your scrub brush. Use a lot of force here to make sure you get all the dirt and grime off the crab.
 Now that your crab's topside is good and clean, it's time to clean the other half. Flip the crab over. This task can be intimidating, but remember - your crab is likely disoriented from the washing process. It is less likely to resist. Give the underside and legs a good scrub, once again using a good deal of pressure. You might want to hold onto some of its legs as you work, just as precaution in case the crab tries to pinch.

 Google takes its hiring seriously. It has devoted several web pages to the process, and anyone interested in applying for a job would be wise to check them out before proceeding:


The main Google Jobs page, located here, provides applicants with links to other relevant pages as well as a search box where job seekers can type in a keyword to find a job that suits them. Bookmark this page and come back to it after you have perused the rest of the site.
The “Joining Google” page, found here, outlines the features Google takes into consideration when hiring. Here, the company lays out what separates successful applicants from those turned down for positions. This page is necessary reading for anyone serious about landing a job with Google.
The “Life at Google” page, contained here, gives readers a snapshot of what it’s like to work for Google. The page contains a number of links to Google-related stories, which are useful for getting a sense of what Google employees love most about working for the company.
The Benefits page, found here, outlines all of the advantages provided to those who are in Google’s employ. These include, but are not limited to, on-site nurses and physicians, extended leave and extra money for new mothers, and even free legal advice. This page is worth browsing for anyone interested in working for Google.;
, This can be done by accessing the office locations page, found here. This site lists every major Google office on the planet, allowing people to click the icon that corresponds to a specific city and scan job postings specific to that office. Each city has its own job page with listings located on the right-hand side of the screen.
 The site, located here, connects job searchers with positions where the work is team-oriented. Those who can’t find anything compatible on the office locations page should check the Teams and Roles page to see if a fit exists. Like the office locations section, jobs are located on the right-hand side.

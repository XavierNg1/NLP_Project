 Because of the nature of invisible illnesses, some people start feeling like they are responsible for their sickness or are making it up. This leads to thoughts that you should be able to “get over it” and get better. Though you may look fine on the outside, your illness is real.This may be especially true if you have conditions like depression or mental illness, IBS, CFS, or migraines. Some people may think these are not real conditions and that you can control your symptoms.
Tell yourself, “It is not my fault that I am ill. I cannot make myself better. I have a very real disease, and that’s okay.”

, When you are around your family and friends, you may feel guilty or embarrassed about your condition. You may not be able to to do the same things that they can, which can cause negative feelings. Remember that your illness is valid, so you should not feel guilty.Whenever you feel embarrassed or guilty, remind yourself, “This is not my fault. I have nothing to be embarrassed or guilty about.”

, Despite your efforts to educate others and explain what you go through, some people may never think that you are sick. They only will believe something they can see with their own eyes. Remember, this is not your fault. You cannot change the way someone thinks.Try your best to explain and educate them, but if they won’t accept it, let it go.

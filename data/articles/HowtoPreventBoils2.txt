 The staph bacteria that causes boils can be spread by sharing personal items such as razors. Each person in your household who needs one should have their own razor.
 Shaving is a big cause of ingrown hairs, which can end up becoming infected and leading to boil formation.Using shaving gel on wet skin will help lubricate the razor’s movement so that it doesn’t snag on your hairs and force them back into the skin., Rinse your razor frequently as you shave. Replace disposable razors frequently, and keep other razors sharpened.Sharp razors mean you have to apply less pressure to the skin to cut the hair, which reduces the likelihood of creating cuts and ingrown hairs.
 Shave in the same direction as your hair grows.This can be a little difficult to determine, especially if you have curly hair. In general, shave your legs in a downward motion. Run your hands along your skin to help you determine what direction your hair is growing.
 Studies have shown serious infections of MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in women who shaved their pubic hair.“Cosmetic body shaving” for men can also cause MRSA infections.In general, it’s best to avoid shaving these sensitive areas.


Shaving your genitals leaves your skin with small micro-wounds, through which the staph bacteria can enter and cause infection and boils. Because the area is usually sweatier than other areas of your body, the likelihood of boils developing is also higher.
 If you notice signs of inflammation or you see a boil, do not shave that area. You could end up spreading the bacteria and infection to other parts of your body.

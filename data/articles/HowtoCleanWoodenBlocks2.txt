 Mild soap with antibacterial ingredients is a good cleaning option for wooden blocks. Combine Â¼ cup liquid soap and four cups water. Pour the cleaning solution in a spray bottle or in a wide bowl.








If you want to add a pleasant scent to the cleaning solution, you can add ten drops lavender or lemon essential oil.
 Spray the cleaning solution on the blocks or dampen a clean cloth with the cleaning solution. Then, wipe the blocks down, cleaning them well.








Do not get the blocks too wet or submerge the blocks in the cleaning solution, as this can damage them.
 Once you are done wiping down the toys, use a clean damp cloth to remove any soap residue. Wipe the blocks well with the damp cloth so there is no soap left on the blocks.
 Place the blocks indoors in indirect sunlight to dry. Once they are dry, they are safe to use.

 The oven or toaster oven is a great way to reheat a number of different foods, but it’s not ideal for everything. For smaller portions, use a toaster oven to conserve energy. Here are a few of the foods you can bake to reheat:Seafood
Bread and baked goods
Fried foods
Breaded foods
Roasted meat and vegetables
Grilled meat
Pizza (when you have more than a few slices)
Lasagna
Casseroles
Foods that were baked to begin with

, Thick foods like large pieces of meat, lasagna, and casseroles will take a long time to heat through in the oven. Shorten the heating time and ensure even heating by dividing them into individual portions before recooking them., You don’t need a high temperature to reheat food, because it’s already been cooked and you don’t want it to dry out. Set the oven to 350 F (177 C) or lower and let it preheat., Transfer the food to an oven-proof dish. To heat individual portions, separate them in the dish or use individual dishes for reheating. To keep the food from drying out, put on a lid, or use foil to cover the dish.Don’t cover foods that should be crispy, such as fried foods.
 Transfer the food to the oven. For smaller food and single-serving dishes, cook for five minutes and then check the temperature.For larger dishes or multiple portions, cook for 15 minutes and then check the temperature. Continue cooking in short intervals until the food is heated through.


Small or thin foods like pizza may only need five minutes
Baked goods, breads, and smaller cuts of meat will need around 15 minutes
Thicker foods like lasagna and casserole may need 30 minutes or more

 For this, either a shower or a curtain tension rod will work. You'll also need a flat twin sheet (or perhaps two) and 2 to 4 food package clips., It is best placed between two hard-to-move objects. These objects could be a wall, bed head/foot board, large dresser, bookshelf, entertainment center, etc., Secure it between the two objects. This is done the same way as you would mount the tension rod in a shower.
 Drape it so that the midpoint of the sheet is covering the tension rod and the top and bottom ends are pointed towards the floor.
 Pinch the sheet just under the rod so that it forms a temporary pocket for the sheet to slide securely without slipping out of place.
 Add cushions, pillows, a flashlight, books, etc.

 It is very important for your paralyzed cat to have a comfortable, well-padded bed. Orthopedic cat beds are designed to be easy on your cat’s joints and prevent the development of bed sores and other problems that frequently develop in cats with limited mobility. They are also designed to make it easier for cats to climb in and out without bending or crouching.Ask your vet to recommend a good type of orthopedic bed for your cat.
 If you have steps or elevated surfaces in your home that your cat needs to be able to reach, purchase a pet ramp or a set of shallow pet stairs. Ramps can help your cat access areas like beds and other furniture, stairs in your home, and even the litter box. Ramps can be especially helpful if your cat is outfitted with a wheelchair or cart., Using the litter box can be a major challenge for a paralyzed cat. If your cat still has some mobility and is able to go to the bathroom without help, it may be enough to get a very shallow litter box, or a box with a low entrance. Cats with more severe paralysis may need to use training pads or pet diapers.Consider keeping the litter box close to your cat’s bed and other necessities, so that your cat will not have to travel a long distance in order to use the litter.
 Talk to your vet about what types of food and water dishes will work best for your cat’s needs. In many cases, elevated feeders can be useful for cats with limited mobility, since they do not force your cat to bend down or crouch to access their food and water., If you are worried about your cat’s lack of coordination or mobility leading to injuries, consider blocking off areas of your home with elevated or uneven surfaces. You can use a baby gate to block off problem areas, or simply close the door to rooms that you don’t want your cat to access without supervision.

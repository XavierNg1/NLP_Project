 If the company that is giving you the job offer is not in your area, and you are not able to telecommute, find out whether or not the company will help you with the relocation process. Moving is a big process and can be very expensive.Ask yourself: Am I willing move for this job? Can I afford to move if the company does not help pay for the move?

, When moving, it is easier to house hunt when in the area you are moving to, rather than looking at houses online. Because of this, it is important to find out if the company will pay for your house hunting trip. The company may also have a relocation specialist who can help you with your house hunt. On the other hand, the company may direct you to hire a specialist yourself and they will reimburse you.



Ask your potential employer: How does this company handle house hunting fees? Does it cover the costs of relocating? Will the company reimburse me for the money I spend while looking for a house? Is there a specialist I can talk to?

, It may take some time to find a good house and move into it. You may choose to instead arrange for a temporary housing set up. While considering the company’s offer, find out how they handle temporary housing. It may in fact be included in the ‘house hunting expenses’.



Ask your potential employer: Does this company cover temporary housing expenses? Is there a meal stipend that is included in the coverage? Does this include my partner or child’s expenses?

, When you do find a house, you will have to deal with actually moving to this house. This can be quite expensive, so it is helpful to find out beforehand if the company will pay for any (or all) of your moving expenses.Ask your potential employer: What moving expenses, if any, does this company cover? Does this include hiring a moving company?

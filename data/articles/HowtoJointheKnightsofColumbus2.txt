 The Knights of Columbus, like most fraternal organizations, keep the content of their ceremonies secret. You have to become a member in order to learn the specific practices of the organization. As a member, you will be asked to keep the ceremonies of the order secret.
 There are four degrees of membership and it takes up to a year to progress through them all. The ceremony for each level focuses on one of the core values and you must progress through them in order. You are considered a full member of the Knights of Columbus once you have attained the Third Degree.


An initiate becomes a First Degree Knight of Columbus through the exemplification ceremony. Subsequent degree ceremonies, each focused on one of the four principle virtues, are held throughout the year.
Members who have been in the Knights for one year (six months with special approval) and have attained Third Degree membership are eligible to join the Fourth Degree.
The Fourth Degree color guard are the members of the Knights of Columbus you see with the regalia (cape, chapeaux, and sword).
 The order is organized into councils, districts, and jurisdictions that are collectively governed by a supreme council. Each member belongs to their local council, which is typically connected to a specific parish. The districts and jurisdictions connect these local groups and aid in regional planning. The Supreme Council provides leadership and administrative support..

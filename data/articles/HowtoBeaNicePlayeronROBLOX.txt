 If you like another player's shirt, say "I like your shirt. It looks good on you". They will probably say, "Thank you" and smile. If a player ignores you, just remember, you're nice even if nobody listens to you.;
, This may get you banned.
 Act funny and nice, and don't tell mean jokes. People take that seriously and you will hurt their feelings, and no one likes mean people.


If you have clothes, just mix and match them. Be pretty or handsome, but be humble. Don't show off and say, "I'm prettier or more handsome than you - you're all ugly." Everyone is beautiful. Show your unique, chic style.
 Yes, it's good to show your inner opinion, but don't say Roblox is for idiots or put others down.
 Give your opinion, and if another person disagrees and says you're stupid or a noob, tell them that your opinion is just your opinion or ignore them - then walk away. You don't want to fight because you're nice; you're a good person!

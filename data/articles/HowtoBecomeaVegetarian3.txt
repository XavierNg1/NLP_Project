 Initially, eat vegetarian as much as possible without giving up meat entirely. Learn to enjoy vegetarian food before you quit meat cold turkey . Start to eliminate different types of meat gradually, having "one last meal" with the relevant ingredient and resolving not to eat it again. Try this schedule for gradual meat reduction:


Eliminate chicken and fish first.
Cut out pork, such as bacon and ham, after a week.
Stop eating red meat, such as beef, after another week.
Cut out shell-fish, such as crab and shrimp, after another two weeks.
 In the early days of going vegetarian, you're bound to eat meat once or twice. Just remind yourself why you decided to go vegetarian in the first place and carry on as before. Relapses are normal, and you will get better at being vegetarian as you practice.


For many people, it only takes a couple of weeks of eliminating meat to stop having cravings.
It might be better if you eliminate all meat from your diet at once, and keep it out for a couple of weeks. Before long, your cravings will be eliminated and you won't want it anymore.
If you find yourself eating meat at times or "cheating", try being vegetarian 6 days a week, or whatever number of days works for you. Gradually increase the amount of days until you can finally let go of eating meat.
Remember, eating meat or fish in any amount means that you are not vegetarian but semi-vegetarian instead. Continuing to eat fish qualifies you as a "pescatarian" at best. You become a vegetarian when you no longer consume animal flesh.
 If you aren't getting enough food, you might start craving meat. There is protein in almost all kinds of food, so you can rest assured that you'll almost definitely get enough protein, as long as you eat 1200 calories or more a day. If you are trying to gain weight it is important to eat a wide variety of legumes, nuts, and seeds into your diet to make sure you get enough calories and healthy fats.

 It’s best to get a mild, hypoallergenic dog shampoo since human shampoos can easily irritate canine skin. It should be free from fragrances and synthetic chemicals.Alternatively you can make your own dog shampoo by mixing together 1/3 cup glycerin, 1 cup mild dishwashing soap, 1 cup white vinegar, and 1 quart water. Put all these ingredients into a liter-sized bottle, and shake before each use., Frequent washing will dry out a Pittie’s skin and deplete the natural oils in its coat. With their fine fur, most APBTs only need a couple baths per year. You should bathe your pet only when necessary and no more than every six weeks unless otherwise directed by a vet.If your dog gets dirty frequently, stick to rinsing off the mud with plain water rather than bathing it more often.
You can bathe your dog in a tub, shower, or outside using a hose with a gentle spray nozzle. Your pooch will be more likely to stay put if you wash it in a controlled or closed space using a comfortably warm water temperature.
It’s a good idea to brush your Pittie ahead of time to remove any loose hair or dirt before it jumps in the bath.
 Wet and lather up your Pittie with dog shampoo from its neck down. Rinse your pooch with luke-warm water using a detachable shower head, pitchers of water, or a hose with a gentle spray nozzle.Don’t soap up your pet’s head to avoid getting water and shampoo in its ears and eyes.
Be sure to rinse your APBT’s coat thoroughly until the water runs clear so that there’s no shampoo left to dry out its skin or tempt your pet into licking it.
 Once you’ve given your dog a good rinse, let it shake off any excess water. Then, wrap your pet in a big, absorbent towel, and gently pat it dry.Do not let your dog out into cool weather until it has dried completely. An APBT’s short, single coat and low body fat mean that it can get cold very easily.

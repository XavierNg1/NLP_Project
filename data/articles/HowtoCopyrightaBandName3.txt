 A sound mark is exactly what it sounds like it is, protection for a sound that identifies your goods or services.


This is a specific way to protect the unique idea of your band. It is something that you should only choose to do if it already makes sense as part of the product you are creating.
Consider as examples the "chimes" of NBC or the "You've got mail" welcoming from AOL., A sound mark is not a song or recording but a brief audio "logo" that will remind a consumer of your enterprise.

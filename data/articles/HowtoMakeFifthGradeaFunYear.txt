 Nobody wants to spend time around mean people unless they're using you for their own means, or worse, they're afraid of you. Everybody wants a nice person as a friend.;
, Try your best to do your homework and any other assignments. Who knows? You may get the teacher to like you and gives you awards for being a good student. Also, don't just rush to finish: Fast isn't best, correct is best. This will also help you to get good grades.


To make it fun, you can do the fun parts first. For example, if you're doing a report on Japan, try looking at some of the fun things the Japanese like to do. You can also take notes while doing it.
 Look after your health, fitness and well-being. Eat healthily, play a sport or do regular exercise and enroll in a fun activity club.
 When you have a lot of friends it will make school a lot more fun.
 It makes a big difference and will help you in the long run.
 If you are, all your friends will leave you.
 Do anything that makes you happy. Like wearing your favorite outfit or doing something fun after school. This will make you want to get up in the morning, but be sure not to wear anything that violates your school's dress code.
 Eat what the school serves, if you like it. If didn't like it, or want something better, bring your favorite food at lunch. Packing lunches also has the benefit of (usually) being cheaper than buying lunch at school.
 New games will make any day fun. Find a fun theme for the game. Just don't be bossy!

, Don't leave out your fun side. Let it shine and be creative. By being creative, you can make more friends!

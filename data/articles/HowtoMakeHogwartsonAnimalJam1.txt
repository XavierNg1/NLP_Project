 The crystal palace is the second biggest den on Animal Jam, and since Hogwarts is huge, that's exactly what you need. Use this den for the base, and build from there.;
, Make sure to include dorms for each house, so that Slytherin, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Gryffindor are all included in your version of Hogwarts. Make beds out of couches, and add bookshelves, Cleverclaw dressers, plants, a fireplace, chairs and other decorations. Make each dorm feel cozy so that students will feel at home in them.


Include elements to personalize each house's dorm. For example, use the appropriate colors for each house so that the dormitories are each as unique as the houses themselves.
 Hogwarts is a school, after all, so you'll need space for classes. Fill each classroom with a teacher's desk, a chalkboard, desks for the students, a bookshelf, and some things for the walls. Then add other things that are appropriate for the classes that will take place there. For example, the herbology classroom should have lots of plants, while a history classroom should be full of books and other study materials.
 Use lots of those fancy tables you can buy at the dinner party. Line them all up in four separate lines, one for each house. Add a table for the teachers, and make sure to include a chair for the sorting ceremony.
 If you have any room left in your den, make a few bathrooms, a library, or other rooms that are found in Hogwarts. If you want to act out certain parts of the series, make sure to include any rooms necessary for those parts. For example, if you want to roleplay the Chamber of Secrets, you'll need to include Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.

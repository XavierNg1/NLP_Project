;
, Grate an inch of ginger for two cups of tea, but do not add it yet to the water.
 Once the water has boiled, add as much as sugar you would like to have.(You don't have to add sugar if you don't want to).
 Add the grated ginger to the boiling water.
 Now add two teaspoonfuls of tea leaves once the ginger in the tea has turned slightly yellow.
 If it's your first time making a tea with milk add a 3/4th cup of milk to two cups of tea. (Again you don't have to add milk if you don't want to).
 You can strain the tea once it has been boiled well and its color is a nice peachy-beige, depending on the type of tea leaves you use).

 This could be a person or an organization. Include any necessary titles. You can probably skip titles for close friends and family members, but you might consider including them for government officials, military personnel, doctors, professors or elderly people.
 This is especially relevant in rural areas where houses or estates are known by name instead of by address. For example, you could write Trinity College Dublin.
 You can include the street number if you only have the street address. If you know the name of the estate, though, the street name alone should be enough. For example, College Green.
 If you're sending a letter to Dublin, you'll need to follow the city name with a specific one- or two-digit postal code for that area of the city. You could write, Dublin 2.
 If you're sending a letter to a major city like Dublin, you probably don't need the county. If you're mailing to a rural area, though, you do.


Note that in Ireland, the word "county" comes before the name, and is abbreviated "Co." So, for example, if you're sending a letter to County Cork, you'd write "Co. Cork" on the envelope.
 If you're mailing something to Ireland from outside of the country, write "Ireland" on the last line.

 It helps you to communicate with other people who're interested the same hobbies as you.;
, Sing to your mirror or your dog! Singing everyday helps you to get used to it, and your voice starts to get better everyday. Hiding your voice keeps it dry. Consequently, your voice wouldn't seem comfortable when you sing out loud to people.
 Dancers watch other dancers, authors read other authors and footballers watch other footballers. That's how you learn and get better ideas, and sometimes you can steal a little bit of theirs. However, you need to twist them around and make them to yours so that people won't think your fully copying them.
 When you write songs, it actually makes sense. You get what I mean? Randomly singing anything doesn't seem right. At least spend thirty minutes of your day, writing a song and singing it. The singers you see out there spend their whole day writing ONE song! Phew. So imagine you, not even using half your DAY writing a bunch of lyrics.
 For an example: Breath in, breath out. Hold your breath for ten seconds.
 Sing in front of a few people! This will build up your courage and sing better

 If you are using a convection oven, then preheat your oven to 375° Fahrenheit (190° Celsius).
 If you are using a whole chicken, cut it into pieces (legs, thighs, breasts), rinse the parts and pat them dry with a paper towel. If you are using pre-cut chicken parts, just rinse and pat dry.



If you want to save time on cleanup, line the bottom of the roasting pan with enough aluminum foil to cover evenly. When the chicken is done cooking, cleaning is as easy as throwing the aluminum foil away.
 Toss to coat evenly with the olive oil.
 Baked chicken can be taken to new heights with lemon, onion, carrot, garlic, thyme, rosemary, cayenne pepper, and so much more. Browse cookbooks or the internet for combinations that spark your fancy.
, Place the baking dish or roasting pan into the preheated oven, uncovered, and bake for 30 minutes, then reduce the heat by 50 degrees and bake for approximately another 30 minutes.
 Poke a fork into the chicken pieces. If the juices run clear, then the chicken is done. If not, return the chicken to the oven and check again in 5 minutes.
 Give the chicken 5 minutes after you remove it from the oven. This allows the juices to reabsorb into the meat, making the baked chicken moist and tender rather than dry.

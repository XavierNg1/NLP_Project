 Using cold air will help you create water vapor from your mouth, which will appear to be smoke. If it is winter, use the cold air outside, or use the cold air coming from your freezer.


Using winter air is easy to do, but because many people know how to do this, it's not a very clever way to produce smoke. Try to use a freezer if possible because it will give you a more exciting effect. Keep in mind that because the source of cold air from the freezer is smaller, smoke may be harder to produce or be more difficult to see.;
, Open your freezer and inhale deeply. Try to place your face as far in your freezer as possible so that you can inhale the most cold air. If you are outside, just inhale the cold air around you.
 After you have taken a deep breath of cold air, breathe out through your mouth. You will need to do this in a cold setting, so don't remove your face from the freezer. The combination of your warm breath on a cold surface or in a cold area is what causes the visible smoke.








For a more visible, lasting effect of smoke, try blowing on a piece of glass. After you have inhaled the cold air, exhale directly onto the glass. This glass will need to be very cold as well so that the difference of temperatures between the cold glass and your warm breath will create the effect of smoke. After blowing on the glass, the cloud of smoke you have produced will condense onto the glass, making it last longer than if breathed into the air.
This "smoke" is produced because as you blow warm air, the water vapor molecules produced by your breath transfer energy to the colder air. This causes the water vapor molecules to move more slowly and bind together to form the fog of tiny droplets of liquid water, which is actually what you are producing.

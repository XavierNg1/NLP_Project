 Peel a banana and cut it in half horizontally. Place half of the banana in a bowl, and use a fork to mash it until it’s mostly smooth.Banana is rich in vitamin A, which helps promote cell turnover to keep skin soft and flake-free.
 Once you’ve mashed the banana, add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of honey and 4 tablespoons (23 g) of ground oats to the bowl. Use a spoon to mix the ingredients until the mask has a uniform consistency.If the mask is too thick, you can mix in 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of milk to thin it out a bit.
Honey helps moisturize the skin, and has natural antibacterial properties to help soothe dry, itchy skin.
Ground oats are a natural exfoliant that can help remove dry, dead skin cells from your face.
 When the mask is fully mixed, use your fingers to carefully apply it to your face and neck. Let it sit on your skin for 15 to 20 minutes so the ingredients have time to work.Using a circular motion as you spread the mask over your skin can help the oats exfoliate more effectively.
 When your 15 to 20 minutes are up, wash the mask off with warm water. Use a washcloth to remove the mask if it won’t rinse easily, but be gentle to avoid irritating your skin.To maximize the benefits of your mask, apply your moisturizer right after you rinse it off.

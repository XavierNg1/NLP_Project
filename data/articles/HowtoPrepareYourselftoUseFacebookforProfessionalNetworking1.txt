 For example, recruitment, entertainment, media, advertising and sales professionals often use Facebook for professional networking; however, if you are part of other industries, there may not be very many people in your industry to network with. Decide if your industry, colleagues and previous employers are using Facebook, before you take the time to use a Facebook account for self-promotion.;
, You can follow many of the same rules as listed above. However, it is never a good idea to put all your networking efforts into 1 social media site, because not everyone uses Facebook for professional networking.


LinkedIn is often seen as the best social media platform for professionals. The profile function is set up like a resume, and businesses often use their accounts to post newly available jobs.
 Your profile should be public, if you want to network, so that people in your industry can find you. However, you should have to approve of all posts, photos and friends before they can appear on your wall.
 Think of this as an "elevator pitch," describing you as a person, employee and professional. It should have a small amount of personality, and have no grammar mistakes.
 You don't want your profile to be too personal, but you do not want it to be bland. For example, if 1 of your interests is nature photography, if you support a charity or if you contribute to a blog online, be sure to include these so that they deliver a small dose of what makes you special or interesting.
 Unlike personal accounts, professional Facebook accounts should not have political, religious, intimate or even goofy status updates. Decide if you would want a potential employer to see the post before you update your status.

 Turn the oven on to 325 degrees F (160 C). Get out a 9 x 9-inch (23 x 23-cm) pan and coat it with cooking spray or grease. Set the pan aside while you make the johnnycake batter., Place ½ cup (113 g) of softened butter and ¾ cups (150 g) of sugar into a mixing bowl. Use a stand or electric mixer to beat the butter and sugar together on medium-low speed.The mixture should lighten a little in color.
 Add 4 cups (400 g) of flour, ½ cup (120 ml) of water, ½ teaspoon of salt, and 2 teaspoons baking powder to the bowl. Stir the batter on low speed while you slowly pour in ¾ cup (180 ml) of milk.The batter should look thick and sticky at this point.
 Scoop the batter into the prepared baking pan. Spread it evenly with a spatula. Or, dust your hands with flour and press down gently on the batter in the pan, so it becomes level., Put the pan in the oven and bake the johnnycake for one hour. The edges of the johnnycake should turn golden brown while the center will still remain light. Cool the johnnycake for a few minutes before you cut and serve it.The johnnycake will not rise as much as a cake or traditional cornbread.

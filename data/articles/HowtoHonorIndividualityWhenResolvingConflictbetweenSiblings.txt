 They can emulate the other's good qualities, but not the bad ones. Different people have different tastes and interests and that is natural and meant to be respected.
 Talk about how they love and care for each other. Bring this up with your children often, as doing so reinforces love and bonding between them. This should help them to remember to love and care for each other., This will foster a mutual caring in each of them. Teach them that good character and happiness is important., Ask them what they think would be the best way to help the other. This way they will be taking some responsibility for each other.

Know that this responsibility becomes a mutual habit for both. They will both end up wanting their sibling to be the best and be happy. Give credit to both of them equally for the success of the other. This will make them want their siblings to do well.
 Instead, try to tell one siblingÂ "How proud you must be to have him/her as your brother/sister!" This makes them feel very important and proud of their sibling, and prevents jealousy from creeping in., Make them realize that come what may to you, they are more important than anything else in the world. This gives them a sense of self-worth and a sense of belonging., Warn them not to turn to physical violence and try not to raise their voice. Tell them that since they know each other well and care for each other, they will come to reason and will eventually sort it out., Commend their understanding and their care for one another and their respect for each other's properties and boundaries once they are back to being friends. Tell them that you are proud of them. Don't tell them who was wrong or who was right. Once they learn to respect each other as individuals and understand that they will not be compared, then they will start seeing the foolishness of wasting their time in silly fights. They will learn to let go and remain as friends and be happy.

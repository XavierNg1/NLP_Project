 She smiles and stuff. Don't be afraid to laugh loudly. Misa is loud, and rude sometimes! Speak your mind.
 So if you have a boyfriend, do the same. Be faithful. But in the beginning, when she contacts Kira, she is border lining stalker-esque. Don't do this. Do not stalk people who catch your interest or you admire. You could get a restraining order.
 She doesn't walk with her head down. She isn't afraid of anyone. Don't fear yourself or anyone else. Just be who you are and shun all who tell you otherwise!

, Misa wears A LOT of accessories, be it chains, skulls, necklaces, or zippers; just be sure not to overdo it...

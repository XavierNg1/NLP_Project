 The line is your reference line and the first leg of your angle. It will be used to determine the position at which you draw the second leg of the angle. It's generally easiest to draw the straight line in a horizontal position on the paper.


You can use the flat edge of your protractor to draw this line.
The length of the line doesn’t matter.
 This point will be your angle's vertex. Mark the paper where the vertex is placed.You don’t have to place the point at the edge of the line. It can be placed anywhere on the line, but is easier just to use the end of the line.
 Align your reference line with the protractor's baseline and mark the paper at the degree of measurement. If you are drawing an acute angle (less than 90 degrees), use the scale with the smaller numbers. For obtuse angles (greater than 90 degrees), use the scale with larger numbers.









Remember, the baseline is parallel to the edge, but is not the flat edge of the protractor. It is aligned with the center of the origin and the line projects to the start of the scale on either side.
In the above example, the angle is 40 degrees.
 Using a ruler, the flat edge of your protractor or another straight edge, connect the vertex with the marked degree, drawing the second leg. This second leg completes your angle. To verify you’ve drawn the angle accurately, use the protractor to measure it.

 If the Official Website states that the only place to interact with them is on the Official Website, then anywhere else you are dealing with an Imposter.;
,


If you met the Celebrity in person, then check if they can remember you, if they can't, then the person is likely an imposter.
Celebrities also meet lots of fans. If you just sent fan mail once and check back a month later and they still "remember you", it's likely an imposter. Also, if you see only nice comments, they likely are an imposter deleting all rude/mean/"gotcha" comments that reveal who they really are: NOT the celebrity at all, and likely they don't have any sort of connection(s) with the celeb.



If the supposed imposter tries to convince everyone that they are the celebrity, then that person is an imposter.



If the imposter gives away any personal information, which is probably inaccurate, that person is an imposter.

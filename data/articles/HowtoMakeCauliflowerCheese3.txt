 Check on the cauliflower pieces to ensure that they’re dry. Next, set them in the bottom of a 2-quart (1.89 l) baking dish. Take the time to spread them out in as even a layer as possible.Make sure that your baking dish is ovenproof or it may crack when placed in the oven to bake.
 Once the cauliflower is in the bottom of the baking dish, pour the cheese sauce over the florets. While you can add the sauce directly from the pan, it usually helps to use a spoon to spread the sauce so you can be sure that all of the cauliflower is covered., To create a topping for the dish, combine 2 to 3 tablespoons (30-45 g) of breadcrumbs with 2 tablespoons (30 g) of grated cheddar cheese in a small bowl. Sprinkle the mixture over the top of the sauce-covered cauliflower in an even layer.You can customize the topping to your taste. For example, you might omit the breadcrumbs if you prefer and use only cheese.
 Place the baking dish in the preheated oven, and allow the cauliflower cheese to cook for approximately 30 minutes. You’ll know the dish is ready when the top is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling.If you want to add a garnish to the casserole, you can sprinkle chopped chives or flat-leaf parsley over the top once it comes out of the oven.

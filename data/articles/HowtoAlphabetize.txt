 Seeing all of the data that you need to alphabetize will help make the process go quickly and smoothly.


If you’re organizing data on a computer, it may help to create a new file or folder for alphabetizing to avoid confusion.
If you’re alphabetizing objects, such as records or books, remove them from their current placement so that you can more easily see the names;
, Avoid clutter and confusion by creating a clear area where your data or objects will go as you alphabetize them.
,,


Place the two items next to each other to determine which comes first in the alphabet.
Choose the one that is closer to the beginning of the alphabet (“A”) first, followed by the one that comes later in the alphabet.



For example, if the first two letters in one word are “Am” and the first to letters in the other word are “An”, then place “Am” before “An”.
Continue comparing the next letter in the word if the words continue to have the same letters until you reach a difference in the letters, then place the word that has a letter that appears first in the alphabet before the other word.
If you get to a point where there are no more letters to compare in one word to the other, the word with the shorter string of letters goes first in the alphabetical order.
If the first words in two items are the same, look to the spelling of the next word to determine which one goes first.



If you’re alphabetizing books or documents, it’s easier to organize and search using the author’s last name.
For example, “John W. Adams” would be listed as “Adams, John W.” and would go before “Adams, John B.”, which would go before “Adams, Lenny A.”

,, For example, “12 Angry Men” should be ordered as though it were written as “Twelve Angry Men”.
 If you’re organizing a large amount of data or objects, a record will help other people follow and maintain your system, and remind you if you forget.

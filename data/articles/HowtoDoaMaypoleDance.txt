 Unless you have access to a Maypole that has already been made for the purpose, you will need to make your own. Find a tall pole and attach ribbons or strong streamers at the top of the pole. These ribbons will need to be an even number, the same number of ribbons as there are dancers.;
, For example, you might have them count off one, two, one, two, one, two around the circle, or A, B, A, B, etc. The A's can go clockwise and the B's go counterclockwise. The dancers go alternately right and left of the dancers going in the opposite direction.
 The pattern the dancers should keep in mind is over, under, over, under, over, under etc.


On the count of "over", the dancer raises his ribbon slightly so the dancer coming in the opposite direction can duck under his ribbon.
On the count of "under" the dancer ducks under the ribbon of the dancer coming in the opposite direction.

, Once you have categorized your photos it will be easier to choose your favorites from each collection. Next you will need to pick your top 15-20 images from each group. Keep in mind that an average size album will require only 100-125 images.
 Once you have chosen your favorite from each folder, right click on the images and copy to a separate folder. Duplicating the file is best so that you can have the images retouched or have filters applied while keeping your original file intact.
 An album should tell your wedding day story. Balance your image choices between the categories you've decided to include.

Narrowing down your selections from the Preparations folder to around 5-10 will allow you to increase your selections in other categories. Typically an album should contain 5-10 images of the bride and groom getting ready, one or two images of the church or event location and 3-5 detail shots such as the program, rings, shoes or flowers.






The ceremony itself is one of the most important aspects of the album so reserving 10-15 images tells a more complete story.






Next, select your family photographs and the images of the bridal party that you would like to include. The Family and Bridal Party shots typically take up the most pages in an album so allow ample space for both sides of the family.






The reception should include everything from the introduction to departure and everything in between so you may find that this is your largest category.
 Remember to include plenty of bride and groom shots because those images make the album more personal and intimate.

 Tags are a way of creating a connection between a specific piece of content on Facebook and a person, page, or group.When you tag someone in a photo or text post, people who see this content will have a link they can click to visit the page of whoever or whatever you tagged.


In addition, tagging someone will send them a notification unless they have specifically chosen not to get notifications from tags. This means that you can call someone's attention to your content by tagging them — the notification will link them right to where they're tagged.
 When you tag someone in a piece of content, this content will often appear in their news feeds. It may also appear in the news feeds of people who are friends with the tagged person.This is important to understand — you don't, for instance, want to embarrass a friend by tagging him in an inappropriate photo, as this will make it easier for his friends and relatives to see it.
 Luckily, it's possible to make it so that the the things you post on Facebook (including any tags you make on them) are seen only by the people you want. This is done with a tool called the audience selector, which only works for your own photos and status updates.


When you're making a status update or posting a video, look for a button next to the "Post" button with an arrow pointing downward. It should be labeled with your current audience settings (usually "Public" or "Friends"). Click this button and use the options in the drop-down menu to determine who can see your post (as well as any tags you make on it).
Note again that you can't control who sees your posts when you're commenting on someone else's photo or text.

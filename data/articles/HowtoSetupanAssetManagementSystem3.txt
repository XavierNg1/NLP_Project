 Digital asset management (DAM) refers to a system that manages digital media content and information, including things like photos, audio files, market information, videos, and customer information, among others. This content can be easily managed using DAM software. To determine what type of DAM system to use, you need to first assess your assets. For example:


What is the volume of your data and content? Determine a measurement in terabytes or gigabytes.
How is the data/content formatted? What file types do you use?, Another important factor in determining what type of DAM software to use is who needs access to the content and when they need it. Think about where the content will be held as well. Will the content be stored in your server and accessed by the DAM or stored in the cloud? In addition, figure out if outside parties, like customers or vendors, will need to access the system. This can be easier with some DAM software packages than others., There is a large market for DAM software with many different competitors all offering slightly different options. Some of these options are web-based and some are installed on your system. They offer a huge range of different services and can handle various volumes of data. Some of the more popular systems include:


Canto.
Celum.
Nuxeo.
EnterMedia.
Widen., Compare the different DAM options and choose one that fits the needs that you identified earlier. From here, you can try a free trial if the software provider offers one. Otherwise, you can just purchase the software and begin loading your data. The exact process will vary between providers and software platforms, but expect to work with the software to upload the extent of your content and then set up your distribution and storage as needed.

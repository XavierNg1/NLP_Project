 The website www.afterabortion.com established by a woman who had five abortions provides a place for women to help each other cope with the aftermath of their abortions. The website has millions of posts, telling stories of how they were coerced into aborting their children by boyfriends, husbands, friends, and family. They describe how abortion was far from being a choice. They speak of overwhelming guilt, nightmares, excessive drinking, drug abuse, promiscuity, an inability to form or maintain relationships, difficulty bonding with later children, and other ways in which they are suffering. Ask them to visit this site and read their stories to know the real impact of abortion on women.
 Abortion advocates are threatened by the pro-life arguments of the organization Feminists for Life which says abortion is a reflection that society has failed to meet the needs of women.Pro-life feminists are destroying the old "baby vs. woman" dichotomy that has dominated the abortion debate for decades. Women and children are not natural enemies, of course; it was a perversion of feminism which brought about such a dichotomy in the first place.

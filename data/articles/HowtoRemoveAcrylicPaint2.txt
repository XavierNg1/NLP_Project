 Be sure it's completely saturated.
 This will give it time to start loosening the paint.
 Don't spread the paint around as you blot; try to keep it in one manageable location.
 It may take two or three soakings before you've removed all of the paint.
 Remove the last traces of the stain by using a regular carpet cleaner on the area that was stained. When the carpet is dry, the stain should be gone.

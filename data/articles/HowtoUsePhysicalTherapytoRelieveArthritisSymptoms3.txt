 Most arthritis sufferers are recommended pool therapy. You can attend water aerobics classes, do water walking, or learn a water therapy routine with your physical therapist.This is a crucial element of physical therapy if you need to lose weight. It will increase endurance and improve daily function.
 In addition to other water aerobic routines, you can try some low-impact swimming. Take a few easy laps around the pool if you’re able to. This can really help minimize your symptoms of arthritis.

Try some slow breast strokes, or even just floating on your back for a few minutes at a time.
 Walking is a great way to remain active in your daily life. Take a nice stroll around your neighborhood, or find a track nearby that you can walk.

Make sure you don’t push yourself too hard or walk for longer than your body can handle.
You could also try bicycling as an alternative to walking. Both outdoor biking and riding an indoor stationary bike can help reduce your arthritis symptoms.

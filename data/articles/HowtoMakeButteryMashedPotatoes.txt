 Allow it to start boiling as you work on peeling potatoes.;
,,, Make sure you have enough water to submerge the potatoes by about 2 inches (5 cm).
, They should be tender and just about to fall apart when you stab them when a fork.
 Allow them to rest and cool in the colander for 5 minutes.
 Use the same pot you used to cook the potatoes, and do this as the potatoes cool.


When the butter has melted and mixed with the broth, remove from heat. Season with salt and pepper as desired.
 Depending on the tools you have available, there's two options:


Mash the potatoes by hand, and pour the broth into the mashed mixture. Use a fork to mix together roughly, being careful not to overwork the potatoes.
Use a potato ricer to put the potatoes back into the pot with the broth. Fold together until the broth and potatoes are evenly combined.

Craigslist.org is easy to use and can bring in a lot of local leads, depending on what kind of business you have.
Additionally, your town may have a presence on sites such as backpages.com, cityslick.net, hubspot.com, etc. Just do an internet search on “local free advertising” for more ideas.
Your local town or community may have free publications where you can list your business without paying a fee (as opposed to the bigger, flashier paid ads).;
, Blogs are useful for gaining organic ranking (which refers to which sites shows up first in an online search) and a lot of blog owners are missing out on local search traffic because they are not using local tags or keywords. For example, if you are a CPA in Charlotte, it pays to incorporate keywords like “Charlotte CPA” and “Charlotte accountant” into your blog and your website.
 Asking for a referral can be as simple as posting a sign in your place of business (“A referral is the greatest compliment you can give us.”) or sending out an email to your client base, or calling some of your key clients to ask for referrals. Whether or not you incentivize your clients (offer a gift or payment or finder’s fee) for their referrals is entirely up to you.
 To host a workshop, check with your local Chamber of Commerce, library, community center, colleges, and Small Business Administration (SBA) to see what kinds of classes or free information is offered, and find out how you can participate.

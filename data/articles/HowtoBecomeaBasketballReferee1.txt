Focus on enforcing the rules you are learning when watching basketball on TV or as a spectator at local games.;
, You can become a basketball official with little to no training, but as a referee, you will be expected to have a thorough understanding of the rules of the game and how they are enforced. It is highly recommended that you attend an officiating training course.Training courses go over the rules of the game from an officiating perspective, which may be unusual compared to the playerâ€™s perspective many are accustomed to.

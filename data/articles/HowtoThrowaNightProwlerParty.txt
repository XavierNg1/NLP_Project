 Bring only friends who can keep a good secret. Make sure that they're quiet and good at sneaking out or have experience. Make sure that the parents of the house are heavy sleepers and sleep for a long time without waking.;
, Also think about where you're going and when. Know which stairs or floorboards creak, when the parents are asleep and such. Go out windows, it's less obvious.
 Leave at about 12AM. Review the plan, then have your normal little party until then.
 Wear only socks if you have to run across tiles, if not, wear shoes like normal. Run your escape route. Make sure that everyone gets out the exit and keep it unlocked.. Lock your bedroom door, and turn off the lights in the room you're expected to sleep in.
 Just stay away from cops, cars, typically other people. If you're visiting someone, let them know you're coming at night, tell them the time you'll be there, and use common sense! Check-up and make sure that the parents are still asleep every hour.

 You must beat it in order to mine rune essence.;
, It's impossible to mine without a pickaxe. So take one with you. It's best to bring one that you can equip; then you have an extra space in your inventory.
 The Rune Essence Mine is the only place in Runescape where you can mine the essence. However, you can't teleport yourself there. And not just anyone can teleport you there either. Here are the people that can teleport you there:


Aubury - Located in the Varrock Magic Shop.
Wizard Sedridor - Located in the Basement of the Wizard Tower.
Wizard Distentour (members) - Found in the Yanille Magic Guild.
Wizard Cromperty (members) - Located just northeast of the Ardougne Market.
Brimstail Gnome (members) - Found in a cave in the southwest corner of the Tree Gnome Stronghold.
 These are normally easy to find. There is one of the rocks in each of the four corners of the mine. If you weren't teleported near the essence, wander around until you find it.
 Mining the essence is fast if your mining level is high. But you can still mine it even if your mining is level 1! Mine rune essence until you don't need any more.
 Now you need to go out of the Rune Essence Mine. The portal is indicated with a red arrow on the minimap. All you have to do is click on the little portal next to the place where you were mining. It will take you back to the person who teleported you there.
 Unless you were planning to do something with your rune essence, you should place your essence in the bank so you can mine more.

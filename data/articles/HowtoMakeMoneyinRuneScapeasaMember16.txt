At least 875 Gold.
Knowledge of the Brimhaven Dungeon.
70+ ranged
Black dragonhide, snakeskin boots, Archer ring, Archer helm. Optional or full void, bring ranging potions it will help you kill them faster. Bring Alching runes for the rune limb drops, etc.
Ring of Wealth

Broad bolts are highly recommended.
Anti-dragonfire Shield (this will afford you good fire protection).
Bring at least 1 anti-fire potion if you don't have a shield. (bring both anti and the shield for full protection.)
A charged Amulet of Glory, or some sort of teleportation tablet (Ardougne Teleport suggested).
,, The North chamber leads to Red Dragons, East chamber leads to Bronze dragons, and South chamber leads to Iron/Steel Dragons (recommended).


If you go to the Iron/Steel chamber, drink your anti-fire potion. There are sure to be a lot of people there, so go to the East part of the chamber. There are usually any people in the iron dragons there. If you are looking for Steel dragons, head to the middle. Kill one, and pick up dragon bones.
If you go to the Bronze Dragon Chamber, make sure you have drunk a dose of antifire potion. Kill a dragon, and pick up the dragon bones.


Each trip you could possibly make 30 thousand gold or more. It depends on how many dragon bones you get. If you collect 20, then that is quite a bit of money.
If you get the rare Draconic Visage drop, then teleport out of there, head to the Grand Exchange, and sell it. Dragonic Visages are rarely dropped by steel or iron dragons. They usually sell for roughly 1.5 million.

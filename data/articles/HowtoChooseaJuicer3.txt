 Citrus juicers vary widely in price, with simple hand juicers ranging from $5 to $20, manual presses running about $50, and electric citrus juicers running anywhere from $20 to $150. Knowing how much you are willing to spend can help you determine what type of citrus juicer to choose.
 Certainly the simplest and most cost-effective option when it comes to orange juice is a good-old hand juicer. These non-electronic, plastic or metal kitchen tools are perfect if you only need to make a glass or two of juice. They take up almost no space in your kitchen; they are cheap and easy to clean. Many models (such as the ChefVantage Citrus Juicer) come with a measuring cup or pitcher built-in.
 Take a peak inside any gourmet kitchen, and you will likely find a manual citrus press. These durable, often stainless steel tools are efficient at extracting the juices from lemons, oranges, or other citrus fruits. These non-electronic devices are also aesthetically pleasing; a manual citrus press looks great on your counter top., Most electric citrus juicers are sort of like hybrids of centrifugal juicers and manual citrus presses. You place half of your citrus fruit onto a ribbed reamer and press down, activating a motor which causes a spinning motion. This is an extremely quick and effective method for juicing citrus and results in a delicious, high-quality juice., If you’ve ever purchased orange juice from the store, you probably know that there are a lot of different preferences when it comes to pulp. You can aim to satisfy the needs of everyone in your household by selecting an electric juicer with a pulp-selection feature. This feature allows you to choose how much pulp goes into your juice, and it is one benefit of using an electric citrus juicer over a manual one.One choice is the Proctor Silex Alex’s Lemonade Stand Citrus Juicer.
Another option is the Black & Decker CJ625 Citrus Juicer.

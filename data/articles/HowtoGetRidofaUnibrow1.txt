 Work outwards towards the part of your eyebrows that you wish to keep. If there are particularly difficult hairs to pluck, use your other hand to pull your skin and make it taut. Be careful not to pluck too much of your eyebrow. Continuously step back to see your results and determine how far you want to pluck.


To figure out where your eyebrow should begin, hold a thin brush vertically at the edge of your nostril and check where it lands along the brow line. That point should be the center starting point of your eyebrow. Repeat this process for both sides of your face., Start from the bottom of your existing eyebrow and work your way upwards. Again, continuously step back and look in the mirror, checking to make sure that you are not plucking too much of your eyebrow.

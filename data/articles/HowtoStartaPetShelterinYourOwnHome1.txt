 If you want to make a zoo, then you need to get ready! You can't just get a cardboard box, put an ant in it, and say "I'm done with my animal center!" If you want to build one of these, you will need the following items, in case you find an animal in need and are not prepared:


Cardboard boxes
Extra aquarium tanks
Plastic boxes
Lamps
Heating lamps
Towels
Water and something like a yogurt tub or bottle cap you can store it in
Food for wild animals;
, You will also need somewhere to keep your animal center. One of the most popular places for this is your garage.
 Just put the cardboard boxes or aquarium tanks or plastic boxes in the area with a bit of space between them. Then put the heating lamps, lamps, towels, water holders, and feed in the corner on a shelf or counter.

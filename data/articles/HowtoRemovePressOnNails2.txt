 If you can’t seem to loosen your press-on nails with warm water and cuticle oil, then you can try using nail polish remover. Pour some nail polish remover into a dish and then dip your nails into the liquid, just up to your cuticles.Then, let your nails soak for at least a few minutes. After a few minutes, pull out your fingertips and see if the fake nails are ready to come off.


Keep in mind that nail polish removers that contain acetone can dissolve adhesives, but the non-acetone kind will not., If you don’t want to dip your fingertips in nail polish remover, then you can also apply some of the nail polish remover to your nails with a cotton ball.









Try to get the nail polish remover under the fake nail to help loosen the adhesive.
 As the nail polish remover starts to work, you should notice that the nails are loosening up. Start pulling of the nails as they loosen up. You can just use your fingers if the press-on nails are loose enough or you can use a cuticle pusher to slowly work at the nail.









Take your time, even if the nail seems loose. Pulling a press-on off too quickly can cause damage to your nails.
 The acetone in nail polish remover can dry out your skin, so make sure that you give them some special attention after you get the press-on nails off.Wash your hands and nails with warm water and some mild soap. Then, dry them well and use some hand moisturizer on your hands and nails.

 Keep them all in a multiple subject notebook or use an accordion folder with sections reserved for notes and handouts pick up a one-inch binder and divide it up between all of your classes. Keeping everything together will reduce the chances of letting something get lost.;
, It doesn’t matter what kind. It can be as simple as a blank notebook, but create a system of writing down everything you have to do that day. You don’t have to spend a lot or record your day hour-by-hour in order to get everything done. Just find a system of writing things down, and be consistent.
 You are not going to get all of your mid-term studying done, go to work and get your grocery shopping done, pay your bills and go to lunch with your roommates all in one day. Be reasonable in how much you give yourself to do each day to avoid rolling over your to-do list to the next day.
 You need to be able to tell the difference between things that must get done and things that can be pushed back. This will help you make sure you get the most important things done first.
 This may sound unrealistic, but if you have to take a nap during the day, you are losing valuable time during business hours that you could be productive. Sleep at night and work during the day. Get into a regular schedule of going to bed at a decent hour to get at least 6-7 hours of sleep and waking up early enough to get a good start on the day.
 Make files for your bills, bank statements, receipts, school transcripts and any other papers you need to save this is an easy way to keep track of those things that can end up cluttering a junk drawer or getting lost somewhere between moves.

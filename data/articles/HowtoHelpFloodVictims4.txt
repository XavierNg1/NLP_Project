 If you live nearby the flood area and your house is intact, consider fostering a displaced family who may have lost their home and everything they own in the disaster., Many people rely on their faith during times of crisis and draw emotional and spiritual strength from the support of church and religion.


If you are part of a church or religious organization, encourage your leaders to reach out to flood victims with support as well as tangible aid.
Some large religious organization, like the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team, send crisis-trained chaplains into areas impacted by natural disasters to coordinate relief efforts and provide further emotional and spiritual support for those affected.If you are a spiritual person, pray for the flood victims and/or reflect for a moment on the situation. Open your heart to ways you can help, and be a comfort to those in need., In additional to other forms of help, you can make some basic, caring gestures towards those in need.Ask how you can be most helpful to those affected by the flood. They might need a hot, home cooked meal, help taking care of their pets, or photographing flood damage for insurance claims.
Be a good listener and remember that sometimes its best to just listen and not offer your own opinions or solutions without being asked for them.
Remember that people need support in the days, months, and even years following natural disasters. Be sensitive to the fact that new issues and difficulties can continue to arise, even after the flood waters subside.

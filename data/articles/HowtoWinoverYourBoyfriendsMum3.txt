 Ask her to join you and your boyfriend for brunch, a trip to a museum, or another non-romantic date. She may not accept, but it always feels good to receive an invitation!

, Keep your eyes open and look for ways to further develop your relationship with her. For example, if she loves art, and you see a notice for a special exhibit, let her know about it.
 She’ll appreciate the effort you are putting into the relationship to further your conversations. Go with whatever common ground you can find, even if it’s something as small as a mutual love of a TV show.


For example, “So have you started rewatching Downton Abbey? I think I’m going to; I miss it so much! Who was your favorite character on it again?”

, People love to be needed and helpful. Learn her areas of expertise and ask for help in them.For example, if she is a terrific baker, ask her to suggest an easy recipe you could learn so you could improve your baking.
If she loves gardening, ask to see her garden and for suggestions for plants you could grow.
 Do the dishes after dinner at her house, bring a side dish to a family meal, or take out the trash. She may say you don’t need to do anything, and if so, take her at her word.If you are having a hard time talking to her, doing a chore may also get you a break from your conversation!

, Invite her to your place for dinner with you and your boyfriend. You do not need to serve an elaborate meal — you could even order food in — but put a little effort into making a nice, cozy evening for her.

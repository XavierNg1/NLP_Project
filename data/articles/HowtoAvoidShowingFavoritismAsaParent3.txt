 When you act as the role model, you relieve that duty from your children. Never pressure an older child to taper their behaviors on behalf of setting a good example. This makes them feel as though you value the younger child more than you value them, which can build resentment over time. Instead, simply explain that their current behavior is not acceptable.For example, you might be tempted to say, “Set a good example for your sister by wearing a helmet anytime you ride your bike.” Instead, you should say something like, “It isn’t safe to ride your bike without a helmet. Always wear one.”

, Comparing your children to one another gives the illusion that you favor one child and can encourage a toxic sibling rivalry. Avoid this by focusing on each child and their needs. If you want one child to do something that another child is doing, encourage that behavior without using their sibling as leverage.For example, instead of saying something like, “You should lay down and go to sleep like your brother,” you should say something more like, “It is time for bed. What do you need to be able to go to sleep?”

, Accidentally favoring one child over another can happen. Observe how you are treating and talking to each of your children over time. If there are any discrepancies, fix them. Sibling rivalry can also point to one or more children feeling like you are showing favoritism. If it seems to be high, you might need to examine how you are treating each child.Make sure to be on the same page as your spouse. Each of you should provide treatment that is as equal, united, and consistent as possible.

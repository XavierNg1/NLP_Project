 Clean ripe peaches by rinsing them under cool, running water. Gently dry the peaches with clean paper towels.


If you dislike the taste and texture of peach "fuzz," you should be able to gently rub most of it off while rinsing the fruit. Use your fingers to do so; do not use a vegetable brush or other rough material.
 Place the ripe peaches in a large plastic bag and seal the top.


Note that you should use a plastic bag, not a paper bag. The bag should be relatively airtight to prevent excess exposure to airflow during this stage.
You can place multiple peaches in one bag, but avoid cramming too many into the same bag since doing so could bruise some of the fruit.
 Place the bagged peaches in your refrigerator. They should remain fresh for at least three to five days, but some peaches last up to one week.


Allow each refrigerated peach to return to room temperature before eating it. Remove the peach from its bag and set it out on your kitchen counter or table for approximately 30 minutes. Doing so improves the flavor of the fruit.

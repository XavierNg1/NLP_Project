 Unlike business bad debt, nonbusiness bad debt cannot be partially deducted. This means that only a completely worthless (uncollectible) debt may be deducted. The debt can only be considered worthless when you have taken reasonable steps to collect on it. You must be able to prove this so that the forgiven debt can be deducted., Deductions for non-business bad debt can only be taken in the year in which the debt becomes worthless. However, this does not require that the debt be actually due. An example might be if the borrower goes bankrupt or is otherwise judged unable to repay the debt before the debt comes due., Nonbusiness bad debts are recorded as short-term capital losses on IRS Form 8949. Specifically, they can be stated on part 1, line 1. Record the debtor's name and note that you have attached a statement explaining the bad debt. Other bad debts can be recorded on lower lines.


You will have to complete a detailed bad debt statement and attach it to your return., The capital loss resulting from non-business bad debt forgiveness can be used to offset capital gains. If there is still a net loss after accounting for capital gains, the remaining amount of the loss can be used to offset up to $3,000 (or $1,500 depending on your filing status) of other income. Any still-remaining losses can be carried over into following years' returns.

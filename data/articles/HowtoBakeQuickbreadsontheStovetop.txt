 A good general recipe for both is 2 cups flour, ¼ cup fat, 1 tsp. baking soda and ½ tsp. salt.

Mix the dry ingredients together, cut in the fat and stir until it looks like bread crumbs, and keep in the refrigerator until you're ready to bake; then add sugar (especially if it's a scone) to taste, and enough yogurt or buttermilk until the dough holds together well. The acidity of this liquid activates the baking soda.
At that point you form it by hand into a biscuit or scone, and lay it on a cold griddle or skillet; you don't want to knead it more than 15 seconds or so, because it won't rise well if you wait too long.;
, Turn up your burner to high and set a timer for about 4 minutes., Cook for another 3 minutes or so; you may find that you can cut the fuel off partway through this and just use the stored heat in the griddle to finish the baking., Otherwise return to the heat for another 2 or 3 minutes, or pop in the microwave for 30 seconds or so to cook the inside. You've still saved at least 3/4ths of the fuel you would have used to oven-bake it.

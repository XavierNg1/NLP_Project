They can be picked on because they are different than the other children. Some bullies have even gone so far as to expose the children to what they are allergic to. Speak to your school’s principal about any concerns you may have and to be on the alert for bullying.


Request a conference with the principal to discuss how they can watch out for signs of bullying with your child and others who have food allergies.

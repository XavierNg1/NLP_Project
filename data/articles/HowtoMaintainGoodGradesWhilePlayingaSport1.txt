 Using a planner to keep track of important sports matches and school assignments can keep you on schedule. Opt for a calendar that allows space to create notes, so you can jot down critical dates and events.


When selecting a calendar, pick one that extends months out so you can take a long view of upcoming athletic practices and assignments. Keep a pen handy too, so you can write things down as they come up.A digital planner on your phone or tablet is an easy solution too, if you’re not the pen-and-paper type. Something you can throw in your gym bag is ideal.;
, Planning ahead the night before can help you accomplish your goals at school and at practice the next day. Look at your calendar, and gather all the books, sports gear and homework you will need. Laying out all these items ahead of time ensures you won’t forget anything important and will be poised to do your best work. This will ward off any stress from forgetting what you need.


Try putting the items in a place you can’t help but remember them, such as by the front door.
 Adjust your mindset to focus not only on the day ahead, but also towards the week or month ahead with a broader focus. If you have sports-related travel or games coming up, be sure to carve out additional time to take care of schoolwork.


If looking at all your to-dos is overwhelming, try setting smaller, more manageable goals. You’ll feel yourself making forward progress when you can check these smaller component parts off your list.

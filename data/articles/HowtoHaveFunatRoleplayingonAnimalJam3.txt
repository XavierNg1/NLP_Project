 There will more than likely be a clan advertising. If you don't like one, leave without waiting for the owner or saying anything bad about the clan, as that would be rude.
 Clans are based on the Warriors book series about warrior cats, so act tough. For more info about roleplaying clans, check out Be a Good Clan Member on Animal Jam.
 You do need certain clothing for this. Warrior cats are actually cats, so change your fur to a natural cat colour. For clothes, wear all types of armor! This includes: Pirate swords (or any type of sword), headdress, fox hat, tail armor (or a raccoon hat , any colour besides pink!), rare freedom bands (for non members), elf leg armor (horses only party), and rare/normal bow and arrows.

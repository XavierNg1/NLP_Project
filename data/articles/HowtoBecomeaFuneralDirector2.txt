 A resume is an important tool on your job hunt. Once you've passed your exam, write a resume to send it out to potential employers.List any relevant experience you have. In addition to things like your apprenticeship, including any part time jobs or volunteer work that would help with a career as a funeral director.
Make sure to use language involved in the funeral service industry. For example, if you worked in an emergency room, talk about helping bereaved families during times of stress. Make sure to keep your entries concise.
Keep the formatting of your resume consistent throughout. Things like your choices in fonts, bullet points, and so on should have a pattern.
 There will be a lot of competition for open positions, so be patient. You will likely have to send your resume out to many places before you hear back. You may have to move to find a job, so do not hesitate to apply to places outside your area.If you're still in school, look into job placement services there.
You can search job boards, like Monster, Indeed, and FuneralNet.
 Once you land an interview, go in prepared. A solid interview can help get you your first job in the industry. Research the funeral home ahead of time so you have a sense of its ethics and mission. Show up dressed professionally and give a polished, professional interview.Practice answering common questions, such as "What problems have you faced throughout your professional career?" and "Why would you be a good asset to our funeral home?" Make sure to prepare answers that showcase your best qualities.
Ask questions at the end of the interview, like, "What's the company culture like here?" You want to show you're genuinely interested in the job.
Be polite at the conclusion of the interview. Shake the interviewer's hand and thank him or her for taking the time to see you.

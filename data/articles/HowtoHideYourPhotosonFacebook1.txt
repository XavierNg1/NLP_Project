 Log into your Facebook account and go to your Timeline (until recently, this was called your Wall) by clicking on your name in the upper right corner.;
, Click on “Photos” in the header. You’ll see it below your cover photo and between the “About” and “Friends” links. All the photos that are allowed on your Timeline will appear.
 As you look through the photos, if you see one that you want to hide, hover your mouse over it and click the pencil icon that appears. Select “Hide from Timeline.” Repeat as many times as you like.


Note that this process will work, to some extent, for photos you have been tagged in. However, you do not have complete control of these photos because you were not the one who uploaded them. Therefore, even if you hide them from your timeline, you should know that other people tagged in them will still be able to see them.

 Before you can tackle any homework, you need to make sure that you have everything you need to finish the job. You can avoid needing to get up every few minutes by gathering all your supplies first.Take out all of your homework from your school bag, including your agenda, if you use one. Go through each homework task and determine what supplies you will need.
Gather all of your supplies and keep them in reach.
Make sure you have lots of paper, extra writing utensils, a calculator or other tools, and any textbooks you may need. If you need to use a laptop or computer, make sure that is available to you.;
, It’s easy to get distracted when you’re doing homework, especially if you find the homework to be boring. Help yourself to stay focused by removing all distractions from your environment.Put your phone away. Put it on silent and hide it in a drawer so you’re not tempted to check it.
If you need to use a computer but find you’re easily distracted by other websites, use an internet nanny to block sites, like social media, that you don’t need to visit.
 Pick a spot to do your homework that is quiet so you can concentrate without getting distracted by loud noises or other people talking.


If you can’t find a quiet place in your home, try visiting your local library.
 It’s easiest to concentrate when you are at a comfortable temperature, not too hot or too cold.


If you find yourself falling asleep when you do your homework, try turning the heat down. You’re more likely to feel sleepy in a room that’s too warm.
 Make sure you have a good source of light so you aren’t straining your eyes to see your homework.


Dim lighting can also make you feel sleepy. Make sure your homework space is bright by opening window shades, turning on lights and using a desk lamp, if necessary.

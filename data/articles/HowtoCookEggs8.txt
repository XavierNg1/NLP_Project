 Crack the eggs into a medium bowl and beat them gently by hand using a wire whisk. Gradually add the stock and soy sauce as you whisk the eggs to combine them.
 Evenly distribute your mushrooms into four separate ramekins.


Shiitake mushrooms are the most traditional, but you can substitute them for your favorite mushroom or a more accessible one if desired.
You can also add up to 1 cup (250 ml) chopped cooked chicken broth or seafood, if desired.
 Pour an even amount of the egg mixture over the mushrooms in your ramekins until each ramekin is filled.


The ramekins should be filled anywhere between 1/2 to 3/4 high.
 As soon as the water reaches a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer.


Note that a heavy saucepan with deep sides will work in the absence of a steamer.
 Transfer the ramekins to the steamer, arranging them in a single, even layer. Cover and let cook for 12 minutes.If you have a steamer tray, place the ramekins on the tray to keep them out of the water. If not, they may be placed in the water as long as the water does not threaten to overflow into the dish.
When done, the eggs should have a firm but silky texture slightly reminiscent of tofu.
 Lift the ramekins out of the steamer and enjoy immediately.

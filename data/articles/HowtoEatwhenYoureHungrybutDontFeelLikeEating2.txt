 While having little to do with the act of eating per se, it will help your eating progress if you acknowledge and understand the specific reasons why you may be feeling this way. Feeling blue may be caused by a load of things. Likewise, there may be biological factors at work which play into depression. The mere act of contextualizing these feelings and actively working through them will make the act of eating seem all the easier.


It's just as important of a psychological step to remember the practical (and necessary) health benefits of eating food. If you see eating as an absolute necessity, you may feel more inclined towards eating.
 Watching TV while eating is often seen as a bad thing and a cause for why people overeat. You may actually find a benefit to watching TV, as you will be able to eat food without it being taking of your attention., If you're having a hard time eating a lot, you can always start out really small. Instead of seeing it as a chore, try to see eating the food as a sensory experience. Find a food you love to eat, and approach it purely with the intent of judging and appreciating the taste and sensation of it.

 For some very old stains, it might be difficult to remove them using a cleaning solution. Applying heat from an iron can help loosen the stain. Make sure the iron is filled with water and heat it to warm on a low setting.Take precautions to avoid burning the carpet. Do not heat the iron to a medium or high setting, as this could melt the fibers in your carpet.
 You can use carpet cleaner, stain remover, or a simple mixture of dish soap and water. Saturate the stain before applying the iron.
 To protect the carpet, you can fold a towel in half and place it over the spot. Place the iron on top of the towel. Keep the heat setting on low and do not press on the carpet like you would clothes, as this could burn your carpet.


Check on it often. Keep the heat low and do not make direct contact with the carpet.
Keep the iron in place for one minute.
 The idea is that the iron and moisture should be able to pull the stain up into the towel. Check under the towel to make sure the iron is working or whether it needs more time. Once the stain appears to be gone, you can remove the towel and iron.


You may want to dry the spot thoroughly with a paper towel, but you shouldn't need to do anything else to remove the stain.

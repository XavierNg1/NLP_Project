 You should make sure to feed your puppy the correct amount of food each day. This ensures they grow at the right weight and gain weight at the proper rate. These are approximate. Make sure to only feed the puppy until the belly is a gentle round shape. Divide the total for the day by the number of feedings per day.In the first week, feed the puppy around 25 to 35 milliliters (0.8 to 1  fl oz) for every 100 grams (3.5 oz) of body weight. In week two, try 15 to 20 milliliters (0.51 to 0.68  fl oz) for every 100 grams (3.5 oz). Week three and four, give 20 mL for every 100 grams.
 You should give the puppy food every two to three hours. This is around eight to ten meals per day. At three weeks, you can feed the dog around six times each day. At five weeks, the puppy should be eating solid foods, but you can still feed them formula two to three each day.Make sure to burp the puppy after feeding. Hold the puppy with their belly against your shoulder. Gently pat the puppy on the back until it burps.
 Puppies may not know when to stop eating. This can lead to overfeeding. Overfeeding may lead to health problems, like milk in the lungs, pneumonia, or diarrhea.Feed the puppy many small meals through the day instead of less larger meals.
Make sure there are no bubbles of milk coming out of the puppy’s nose. This can point to overfeeding.
 Make sure the puppy is on their stomach. Place the nipple in the puppy’s mouth and press the bottle enough so that one to two drops of milk come out. This will help the puppy figure out that the milk is in the nipple, and they will start to suck.Don’t place the puppy upside down, upright, or on their back to feed them.
 Between each use, you should clean the materials. This ensures that you don’t contaminate the formula and make the puppy sick. Clean the bottles, syringes, eyedroppers, and other material by boiling them for 10 minutes. Do this after every feeding.If you’re using syringes, make sure to remove the plungers.

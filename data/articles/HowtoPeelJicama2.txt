 Tuck the blade of the vegetable peeler under the fibrous skin.
 Take a section of the skin off of the jicama.
 Keep peeling until all of the skin has been removed. It's important to get every last bit, since eating the skin can give you a stomach ache.
 Cut the jicama into matchsticks or cube it according to the instructions in your recipe. Discard the peel in your compost pile or garbage bin. Jicama is delicious prepared the following ways:



Julienned - the matchstick-shaped pieces are for adding to salad and slaw.

Cubed and roasted. It makes wonderful oven-roasted fries.
Chopped and boiled. Add some butter and salt for a wonderful starchy treat. You can also mash jicama like a potato.
Sliced and sauteed. It's a 5-minute side dish that pairs perfectly with any meat or fish.

 Yes, eat as if you had "weight loss surgery". But clearly bite size and food content make a mammoth difference.No, bulimia or anorexia will not come from eating little for a few weeks! Those are totally different eating disorders with an obsessive, mental component, such as thinking "I'm still fat" (when bony/skinny), or repeatedly binging and purging.
 You might try eating only two medium Snickers, Baby Ruth, or such bars a day.
Can you (if fairly healthy) eat candy safely. "Yes!", but you ask "How does that work?"

, If you chose surgery, then eat almost nothing for 3 or 4 months, by Doctor's Orders! Then never be able to eat a large meal ever again, for life...


Decide whether to have such surgery; if not, then: Skip the doctor's radical surgery and doctor ordered, forced "starvation", starving safely, how? Avoid the doctor's knife and those ways to starve, if you do not have the surgery.

These boots have a special pad on the bottom of the shoe.;
, A harness will keep you from falling off your roof if you slip or lose your balance. Strap the harness on according to the manufacturer instructions and make sure that it's completely secured. Attach the other end of the harness to the chimney or a window on the opposite side of the house. Only leave enough slack on the chord so that you can clean the area.You can purchase a complete roof harness system at department stores or online., Do not try to wash your roof if it's raining, snowing, or windy. These conditions can make you unstable while you wash it, which could be hazardous. If it's recently rained, make sure that the roof is dry before trying to stand on it.

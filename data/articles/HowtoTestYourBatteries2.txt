 The benefits of this method is that it is much more versatile, and can work with non-alkaline batteries and different battery types (such as the 9-volt, C, and D models). This method is also helpful if you cannot deduce the condition of the battery from the drop test., This is to ensure that this voltage is above the battery voltage.,

For AA, AAA, C, and D batteries, the positive terminal is the protruding end.
For 9-volt batteries, the positive terminal is the smaller of the two ends.
 If the reading is very close or exact to the proper battery voltage, then the battery should still work. If it's not, then it's probably dead. Below is a list of the proper battery voltages as a guide:

AA, AAA, C, and D alkaline batteries are 1.5 V.
AA and AAA nickel-cadmium/nickel-metal hydride batteries are 1.25 V.
9-volt batteries, of course, are 9 V.

 Rosetta Stone and Transparent are two brands of software that let you learn Latin as one of their languages. Transparent's website also has some Latin words and phrases that you can hear spoken for free.


This is by far the easiest way to get started. You can do it on your own time at your own pace. It's best to study a bit every day (and you can do this at home!) to truly ingest everything -- software products couldn't make this any easier.
 Check your local public library, school library, or bookstore for publications that will help you learn to speak the language. Possible resources to get include a Latin dictionary or books on Latin grammar.


As an extra resource, indulge yourself with the internet. There are hundreds of videos and sites out there that can get you started. Though no one speaks the language technically, there are still tons of people out there looking to keep the language "alive."

, Classical figures such as Virgil and Cicero wrote in Latin. During medieval times, Latin was also widely used in the educational, legal and religious fields. How cool would it be to read the classics in their original language?!


When you do this, don't be tempted to use a dictionary with every word. It'll become too much of a crutch and slow you down if you do. Set out to only get the general drift and bust it out if you're truly stumped.

 Pain or discomfort in the abdomen or stomach will intensify as a cancer progresses and a tumor grows. The pain associated with stomach cancer will generally increase in intensity over time, and will not subside with medication.Stomach tumors can compress surrounding structures, while ulcerative cancer can erode the stomach's membranes. Both of these two things can cause stomach pain.
 Cancer cells secrete substances that diminish the body's hunger signals. This, combined with a tumor tricking your stomach into feeling full, can lead to a distinct loss of appetite.As a result, as cancer progresses, a patient can suffer severe weight loss. If you think you are losing your appetite and losing weight for no reason, keep a record of your weight loss and talk to your doctor., Over time more fluid will build up in your stomach and you may begin to notice lumps and swelling in your stomach.In cancer of the stomach, patients may feel a hard, irregular lump in the abdomen. This lump will move with breathing, and may fall forward when you bend over.

A developed cancer may cause a hard mass in the left-upper abdomen in the area of the stomach., When stomach cancer reaches more advanced stages, it can cause continuous bleeding, which is lost as excrement. This will result in bloody or black stools. Check for blood in your stools after going to the bathroom. Look to see if they are very dark, and black like tar.If you experience constipation or diarrhea, this can be a symptom of stomach cancer.Always be completely open when discussing any symptoms in your waste with a doctor.

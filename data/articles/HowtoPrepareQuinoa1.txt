 You can skip this step if you have purchased pre-rinsed quinoa in a box. To rinse, place the measured grain in a strainer under running water for a few minutes. This is necessary to remove the excess saponins on the outside of the grains which impart a bitter flavor to quinoa if not removed.;
, Drizzle a bit of olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add the quinoa and cook for about 1 minute. This brings out quinoa's nutty flavor.
 Place two parts water or stock to one part of quinoa in a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer the quinoa for about 15 minutes or until the grain becomes translucent and the white germ forms a visible spiral on the exterior of the quinoa grain.


Try to ensure there is an al dente bite to the germ, in the same way as pasta. Quinoa will continue cooking for a bit even after you take it off the heat.
 This will give it time to absorb any moisture that might still be in the pan.
 The quinoa should look light and fluffy, and you should be able to see the germ separating from the seed.
 Freshly cooked quinoa should be served immediately to retain nutritional value and a good flavor. Serve with:


Stir-fry, using the quinoa as a substitute for rice.
Curry.
Braised meat.
In a salad.
Virtually any other combination you can think of!

 If you do not observe your surroundings, a punch will not help you much against a crew of people twice your size.;
, A hook punch is most effective at close range. If your opponent is far away from you, close up the distance between you and your opponent before executing a hook punch.


If you try to throw a hook too far from your opponent, they can block it, leaving you wide open for a punch to the face.
Practice your punches and know how close or far away from your opponent you need to be for your punches to be effective.

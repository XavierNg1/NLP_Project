 Measure out 1 tbsp. (15 ml) of olive oil and put into a microwave-safe bowl. Measure out 1 tbsp. (15 ml) of honey and add to the olive oil in the bowl. Stir gently.


Olive oil will give your hair natural shine as the honey conditions it.
 It needs to be heated so that when you stir the mixture, the oil and the honey mix into each other evenly rather than remain separated in the bowl. Once mixed, test the mixture with your finger to make sure its not too warm to use. If it is a little too warm, give it a moment to cool down before proceeding.
 Work with small sections at a time for even coverage. Take care to cover evenly from root to tip, concentrating on the ends. You want each strand coated, but not drenched in the mixture.
 After you've evenly applied the mixture, use a warm towel to carefully wrap your hair securely in a turban-style. Make sure no strands are escaping the towel. If any drops of the mixture drip from beneath the towel, carefully wipe them away, avoiding the eyes and eye area. Keep your hair wrapped for 30 minutes.


To warm the towel before use, try tossing it in your dryer for a few minutes. You want the towel to be warm and cozy, but not hot or uncomfortable.
 Shower and shampoo your hair as you normally would during your hair care routine using your moisture boosting shampoo. Make sure to clean your scalp and hair well but don't over-lather, as this will strip your hair of moisture. Take care to get all of the oil and honey completely rinsed from your hair. Rinse clean and towel dry until damp.
 Repeat this process twice per month for best results. Regular use of this treatment will make your hair stronger and softer.

 Don't make it too tight as the tighter it is, the heavier it gets, and a heavy mace ball is dangerous.;
,,, Wrap it in different spots and wrap at least 4 times. With a varied wrap like this, the ball will not come off the string. Tie a knot after each wrap.
 If you are using plastic chain, thread each wrap of the string through the link as shown. Every wrap should go through the chain. This is both for strength and for safety. If you are not using a chain, then create a hoop with these string lengths. This way you can run another series of strings through it and attach them to the handle of the flail.
 Complete the shape and size of the ball head by taping it over completely. Don't be stingy with the tape; the more tape you use, the stronger it will be. Make it as reasonably smooth as you can and shape it as much like a ball as you can. You will be painting this surface, so the smoother the better.
 The pointy cones will attach to the mace ball.


Cut a circle.






Fold the circle in half.






Curl the half circle forming a cone.






Make 8 to 16 cones depending on the size of the flail.
 Tape the cones to the head of the flail. Use a nice random pattern and tape them down nice and secure so they don't come off. do not fill them with newspaper. We do not want them to be overly strong. It is better that the collapse or get crushed rather than cause damage or injury to someone.
 Drill a hole in the end of the flail handle as shown. (Through the side at around half inch from the end. This is for strength and safety.


Pass the string through it several times and with each pass put it through the chain. If you are not using a chain, then just make each pass into a loop. Tie several lengths of string to this loop and about 15 to 18 inches (38.1 to 45.7Â cm) further along, you tie all the strings to the loop in the mace ball.
 The flail is complete and ready to be painted.

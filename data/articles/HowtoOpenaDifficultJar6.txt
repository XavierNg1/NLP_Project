 Heating the lid will cause it to slightly expand, breaking the seal. It can also help melt jam or other food that may cause a lid to stick.









This method may only be used to open jars with metal lids. Do not heat plastic lids, as they may melt.
Only use this method as a last resort. Heating a jar lid can cause it to become hot enough to burn your skin. Be very careful when handling the jar.
 Do this just long enough to heat the lid. Don't hold it for too long in any particular place, or the lid could warp.
 Don't place your hand directly on the lid, since it will be very hot. The lid should easily twist off. The heat may have melted the contents of the jar.

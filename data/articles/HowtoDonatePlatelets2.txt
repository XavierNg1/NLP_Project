, The physical donation process generally takes between 1.5 and 2.5 hours, and you will need to allow time before and after donating for paperwork, refreshments, and rest.
 You will fill out a health history form and have a confidential interview with a staff member. If everything is OK, you will be given a brief physical in which your pulse, temperature, blood pressure, and iron level are checked. These tests will see if it is safe for you to donate.
 For most donors, platelet donation is a painless process after this point. You may watch a movie, listen to music, or simply sit back and relax while you donate.


During this time, your blood will undergo a process called apheresis (also known as platelet pheresis). This means that whole blood will be drawn from your arm and passed through a machine called a plasmapheris device. The machine separates the platelets from other components of your blood. The non-platelet components are then returned to your body, usually accompanied by a saline solution.

 Choose a small paper grocery bag or paper lunch bag for a very small toddler. You can use a hole punch to create even holes or a sharp pencil.
 These are found in office stores and they are commonly used to prevent paper holes from ripping. You can also reinforce them with masking tape.
, Tie the string inside the holes so that it holds when you pick it up by the string. Make sure it is a loose loop.
 Tie it tightly.
 Tie it in a knot in the middle. Then, tie a knot at the end of the string to form your handle.
 Provide your toddler with non-toxic craft paint. Allow them to decorate it as them see fit.


Another option is to decorate it like a tropical fish. Glue or paint eyes on the sides of the paper bag. Paint the bag with scales and fins.
 Cut streamers out of the tissue paper. Glue the streamers onto the bottom of the paper bag, so that they will flow once it is in the air.
, As the paper bag fills with air, it will float above the ground.


Add a longer string handle if you want the kite to fly higher.

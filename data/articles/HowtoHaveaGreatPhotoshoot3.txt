 Though you want to remind him of what he's missing when he's away, remember that this photo may be something he wants to hang up--without having his friends snicker every time they pass his office or school locker.


If you're a girl, avoid showing too much cleavage, or exposing your bra straps.
If you're a guy, keep your shirt on.
 Use this as an opportunity to show off what he loves most about you--not to try a new look. Save your experimenting for another day.


You should wear that dress he's always complimented, or the skinny jeans he's crazy about.
If he thinks you have cute teeth, show those off in your photo--accentuate the features he loves most.
 This will show your loved one that you're always thinking of him or her--not to mention how much you love his or her presents.


If your boyfriend gave you a nice gold bracelet for your birthday, or that pair of boots you always wanted, you can wear those in the picture to remind him of his love for you.
If your girlfriend gave you a nice sweater for Christmas but you haven't had much of a chance to show it off yet, this may be the time.
 This will remind him or her of what they love about you other than the way you look--and will be something else your loved one can treasure while you're away.


If you're female, you can leave your sweetie a note on the back of the photo, or add a touch of your favorite perfume, to make sure he's thinking about how much he misses your smell and cute handwriting.
If you're a guy, spraying the photo with the cologne she loves will make your girlfriend miss you even more.

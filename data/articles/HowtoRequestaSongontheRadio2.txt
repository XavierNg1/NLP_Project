 Some radio stations will only allow you to request a song through the internet. After finding a radio station that you enjoy, look the station up online. Most radio stations have a website and pages for a show on that station.
 More and more stations set up an electronic form to request a song. The form will typically ask for your name, email, location, and information about what type of music you like. Fill these out to best of your ability.Depending on the radio station, you will receive information about the request you submitted. Some stations won’t send you any information about your request.
Fill out several forms and hope for a response.
 Many radio shows will have their own social media page that is separate from the station’s website. Look through the history of the radio show’s comments and look for song requests. If you see other people requesting tracks, you have a chance yourself.Be polite and enthusiastic when requesting through social media websites. The show’s web coordinator will appreciate a fan of the show, and might honor a request by her.

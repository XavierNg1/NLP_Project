iMessage is only available on OS X Mountain Lion or higher.
, This will open Messages.
 It’s in the top-left corner of the window.
 You can search keywords from the message you want to view. You can also type the name or phone number of a person to show all conversations involving them.



There are limitations to the search feature. If the message is too far back in your conversation history, it will not take you directly to the message. Rather, it will take you to the end of the conversation it is within.
You will only see the most recent match to your search. If you want to view previous matches, press ⌘+G until you find the match you're looking for.

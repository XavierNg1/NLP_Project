 A plastic container can work well for superworms. You can also pick up an aquarium at a local pet store. The container should be large enough that its top will be at least three inches away from the substrate.You can easily use plastic container you have lying around the house for superworms. For example, you can use a plastic container used to store old clothing.
Make sure the container has smooth sides. This will prevent superworms from crawling out.;
, Superworms need some ventilation to thrive. It's a good idea to go for a container with a mesh lid. If your container does not have a mesh lid, you can poke very small holes near the lid to allow ventilation.Make sure the holes are small enough that superworms cannot crawl out.
 Substrate refers to the material that lines the bottom of an aquarium or cage. Bran, wheat bran, or uncooked oatmeal are all suitable substrate for superworms. They provide some moisture without harming the worms.Substrate should be at least four inches thick so the worms have room to burrow.
Make sure any substrate you add is dry. Too much moisture can kill superworms.

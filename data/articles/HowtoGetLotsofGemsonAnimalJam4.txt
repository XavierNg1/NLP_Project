 Any adventure is fine as all of them can give you gems to earn. Do the hard mode adventures as you will earn more gems from collecting the chests., It doesn't really matter, but some of the adventures do contain secret passages with chests for certain animals to open.


In Return of the Phantoms, the secret passage is for the Arctic Wolf.
In the Phantom Portal, the secret passage is for the Fox.
 Sometimes adventures go really slowly for some people, but if you finish it, you get a prize either way. Sell the prize you earn, or just get the gems given.
 Get rid of all the phantoms you see along the way. You get 25 gems per phantom, and in some adventures, that could lead to a lot of gems in total.


For example, if you have eagle, play Forgotten Desert. A lot of the items sell for a lot of gems. If you don't collect the chests scattered around the map, you usually get better items when you collect all the gems.

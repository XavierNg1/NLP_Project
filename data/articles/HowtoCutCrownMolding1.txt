 Start in the least-visible corner of the room, especially when installing molding with a design. This is because it is fairly easy to line up the pattern in each corner as you go, but the final corner will most likely not match.


In the first corner, draw a line on each wall that intersects at the corner along the bottom of the molding. This will help keep you aligned as you install. To do this, hold a small piece of scrap molding up to the corner. Run a pencil along the bottom of the molding to the corner, and repeat the process on the other wall so the lines connect.;
, Using a tape measure, measure the wall from corner to corner. Face the corner, and determine if you will start with the left piece or the right piece.


Measure out your first piece of molding based on the wall measurement. Mark your measurements on the bottom side of the molding on both ends.
 Place the molding upside down on your saw table. Hold it as if the table was the ceiling, with the side that touches the wall facing you. This will allow you to see the measurement marks you made on the bottom edge. , The molding will be installed flush against the wall in the corner. Don't worry about the angle yet, the second piece will be cut to fit into the first.

 Many dermatologists will recommend a heavy/thick moisturizing cream or ointment instead of a lotion for treating psoriasis. This is because thicker creams will lock water into the skin, allowing the moisturizing effects to last longer.You may want to ask your dermatologist: "What type of moisturizer do you recommend to treat my psoriasis?", "Should I use a cream, ointment, or lotion?"

, You may want to consider using extra virgin coconut oil, instead of cream, as a form of moisturizer. Oils can be preferable to creams because they help to prevent the evaporation of water from your skin and the moisturizing effects can last for up to eight hours. In order to use coconut oil as a moisturizer for psoriasis follow these tips:Use coconut oil on plaque psoriasis spots in the morning after showering.
Heat the coconut oil in warm water in order to make it easier to rub into your skin.
Apply liberal amounts of oil to affected areas.
Reapply throughout the day if the skin begins to tighten and dry out.
 Lotions are not as useful as creams or ointments when moisturizing with psoriasis. This is because most lotions are very thin and contain a lot of water. Although lotions are absorbed into the skin quickly, they do not have long lasting benefits.


If you do use a moisturizing lotion, you will have to reapply the moisturizer more frequently throughout the day., In order to find a moisturizer that works well, you may need to experiment with a variety of different oils, creams, and ointments. In many ways this will be a process of elimination until you find one that helps keep your skin moist. You can reapply moisturizers throughout the day and do not need to stick with one particular moisturizer. For example, you may find that you like using an ointment in the morning but a lighter lotion before getting into bed.

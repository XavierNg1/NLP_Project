 Some corn snakes will bite when you pop them. Therefore, try to have someone control the head so you don't get bitten. The person should hold the snake near the base of the head, placing light pressure on the sides of the head. Don't apply pressure underneath the head, as that can cut off breathing.Remember to only perform this technique on hatchlings.
 With the snake's belly up, look at the tail of the snake. Find the opening that is a few inches from the tip of the tail. Have tip going away from you., Using your dominant hand, apply gentle pressure just underneath the opening. Hold the tip of the tail with your other hand., Moving from the tip of the tail towards the cloaca, apply gentle pressure along the snake. You are gently squeezing it toward the cloaca, sort of like getting toothpaste out of a tube.Applying excessive force could cause tissue damage to the snake. Make sure you don't press too hard.
Before you try this procedure for yourself it is best to be shown what to do by an expert, such as a specialist reptile vet or a trained herpetologist.
 In a male snake, the hemipenes will pop out.You'll see two little tubes pop out of the opening if it is a male.A female won't have these tubes. All you'll see is two pink dots at the opening.

 It can be very stressful to take care of twins. Even if you maintain a strict schedule, the babies will not always sleep and eat together. Make sure your partner or a family member can help you out with household chores while the twins are young.


If you are the primary caregiver of your twins, have your partner or another family member take over some of your usual household chores. It may be difficult to keep up when caring for two children at once.Talk to other parents of twins. Ask them for advice and feedback on how to maintain their energy levels throughout the day., You cannot expect your twins to fall into the same sleep schedule right away. It will take a few weeks before twins are napping consistently and at the same time. Try to have patience. Keep on a regular schedule and, eventually, your twins will learn to nap.
 As a parent, you need to make sure you're getting enough sleep on your own end. You need to stay energetic to have the stamina necessary to care for twins. Try napping on the same schedule as your children. When you put them down for a nap, take a nap as well. If you have very young babies, napping during the day may help you make up for sleep lost during nightly feedings., When parenting twins, cut yourself some slack. When the twins are infants, especially, step back on social obligations. Do not volunteer for an event at work. If a friend comes to town to visit, do not offer to host. Your friends and colleagues will more than understand your circumstances and will not want you overexerting yourself.

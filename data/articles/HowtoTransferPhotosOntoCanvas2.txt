 This special way to preserve color images requires only the following supplies: fine tissue paper; an iron or other flattering material like a stack of books; a canvas; and sealer glue, such as Modge Podge.
 Place the tissue paper onto a table or other hard surface and lay the framed canvas upside down onto it; the front of the canvas and the tissue paper should be touching. With a pencil, trace around all four sides of the canvas, and then cut around the four corners of the tissue paper.
 Use the high setting without any steam.
 This may take a few tries, but the end result will be worth it. Adjust your printer settings so that the printed image is only as big as the tissue paper.


For this reason, it's best to use a standard size when selecting a canvas to use. An 8 1/2 x 11 canvas, for example, would be extremely easy to work with, while a nonstandard-sized canvas would be more difficult to get a match for.
 Use a brush to get good coverage with your adhesive.
 Get one corner centered perfectly before placing the whole image down onto the canvas.
 Work from the inside and brush outward for best results.
, Use the same coat of Modge Podge, if desired, or pick another type of (matte, etc.) finish to seal your newly-minted canvas photo.

In her book, "The Prosperity Plan," author and financial expert, Laura B. Fortgang, stresses that wealth and prosperity are a state of mind that can be attained by training the subconscious to welcome wealth with positive thinking rather than driving it away with negative messages.;
, Commit yourself fully to this personal "Wealth Attraction Plan."


Realize that wealth comes in many forms. Wealth may be financial, yet it can also be romantic. You may desire a wealth of new friendships or in new professional possibilities. Write down the kind of wealth you want. Be specific.
 Be open to ideas and suggestions for new kinds of work and wealth-creating ideas that are offered to you.


Fortgang stresses that it is imperative to realize that opportunities exist all around us, yet if we don't allow ourselves to see them, we cannot take advantage of them. Saying "yes" to new opportunities is a way to become more "attractive" to wealth of all kinds.



Make a list each morning of at least 3 things you have to be grateful for. The list will grow as you begin to acknowledge all you already have. Be grateful for what you have now as you work to realize how to attract wealth into your life. Many people feel that they have no wealth in their lives because they do not acknowledge what they do already have. Having an "attitude of gratitude" is a critical component in knowing how to attract wealth.



Write down a goal of how much money you want to make in 3 months and then in 6 months. Be specific. Fortgang stresses that as we write out these specific goals, we must work gratitude into the statement. For example, write out "Thank you for the $100,000 I am going to make by the end of the year." If, as time goes on, you are not making as much as you set out in your goal, be grateful anyway and keep on making positive goals for yourself.
 Begin each day with a meditation on gratitude and with the knowledge that wealth of all kinds will be entering your life immediately.

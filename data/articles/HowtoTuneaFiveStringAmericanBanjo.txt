 Hold the "neck" (the long, narrow part with the strings) in your left hand, with the fat part across your stomach, and look at all five strings.;
, This strange "5th string" placement is unique to the banjo, is used to give the Banjo that unique "roll" and "bounce" to its sound.
 The SECOND string your hand plucks will in fact be the FIRST string on the tuning board, and so on. Follow the strings from bottom to top, and you'll understand.
 The banjo, when tuned, will play an open "G" chord. This means, unlike most string instruments, you can just strum without holding any strings, and it will still make a pleasant, ringing harmony.
 This is the first one to tune. You can use many different tools to tune with. The easiest is any mechanical "tuner" that tells you when you are above/beneath the pitch. If you don't have one, though, a piano, pitch-pipe, or any other fixed pitch instrument (like an accordion) will do. All you need is a constant, even pitch, plus an half-sensitive ear.
 Keep plucking the string and twiddling the knob, until it is tuned perfectly to a G below middle C, using any of the above methods.
,, Tune this to a G, a full octave above the first G you tuned.
 This gets tuned to a low D.
 You are DONE!

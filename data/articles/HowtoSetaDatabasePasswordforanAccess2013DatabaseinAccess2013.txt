 Assuming you have it installed, you'll find this program on your computer either in your Start menu or on your Start screen.


On Windows 10, you can type "Access 2013" into the Cortana search box in the bottom left corner of the taskbar/screen to the right of the Start menu icon. Click "Access 2013" when it pops up.;
, Select Open, find your database file then click "Open" . If the program was closed before, you'll see an area that says "Recent"; you can click the "Open Other Files" button in the maroon-red bar on the left of the screen.


For quick access to other areas to open Access database files from, you can press the keyboard shortcut for Open by using the shortcut Ctrl+O.
If you created the database within 24 hours, you can forego opening it in Exclusive Mode. However, if it's been more than 24 hours since it was created (there's this 24-hour window of time), the database will warn you that you'll need to open it in Exclusive Mode to set a password.
 This will expose some options including New and Open once again. But this time, these options aren't quite what you need but are displayed on screen to the right of these options in the red drop-down.
 This button should be in the white area of Database properties near the short dividing line between Close and Account options of the File menu. If you see "Decrypt with Password" instead there, you have a password already set that you'll have to enter into the database entry field each time you enter the database.
 Type something in the top "Password" box, then match that set password in the bottom "Verify" box.


Remember this password (or write it down someplace and put it in a safe spot where no prying eyes can find it). Once set, there are no "Forget password" or "Reset" buttons to reset the password to something else until you have opened up the database later.
, This is one of the extra levels of security using Primary Keys will give you with a database, if you have one set.

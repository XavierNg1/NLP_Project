 If local hospitals or community organizations are not actively advertising an event, check lists of national organizations or check museums, concert halls, schools, and conference centers for other events.
 Many organizations can benefit greatly by even small donations.


If you are unable to make a financial gift, consider donating your time as a volunteer or making a public appearance at a rally or event to show your support. Some organizations use ribbons, colors, silence, prayer, and other free activities to spread the word about mental health issues.

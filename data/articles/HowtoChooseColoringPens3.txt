 When you use a coloring book, the paper quality is chosen for you. However, alcohol and oil-based pens will bleed through paper, ruining the image on the other side. Water-based pens are safer to use in this case, although if you attempt to layer colors you may tear thin paper.One trick to reduce bleeding is to place a second surface, such as cardboard or another piece of paper, under the sheet youâ€™re coloring.
You can also try more bleed-resistant pens, such as pigment-based pens, for detail work.
 Thicker paper, including watercolor paper, Stonehenge paper, Bristol board, and illustration board absorb more color than standard paper. This limits the bleedthrough by alcohol and oil-based pens., Smooth paper works better for pen drawings since rough spots break up lines and colors. You can see the smoothness of the paper by looking for bumps. However, look at the package for a GSM (grams per square meter) number. A larger number means thicker paper, which retains ink better.GSM goes from 74, which is standard copy paper, to 260, which is heavy cardstock.
There is also low GSM bleedthrough-proof paper that is designed for alcohol-based pens and is used for comics and other designs.

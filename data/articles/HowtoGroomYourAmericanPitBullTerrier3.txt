 Pit bulls are prone to certain skin conditions, like mange and allergies. Skin issues can seriously affect the condition of your dog’s coat, making it dry, dull, and/or flaky. Sometimes bathing and grooming can exacerbate these issues instead curing them. As you groom your dog, keep an eye out for visible irritations, like sores, scabs, rashes, or hot spots., If you notice symptoms of skin issues that are chronic, severe, and/or widespread, you should make an appointment with your veterinarian. Skin irritations could be a result of allergies or a symptom of more systemic issues like an immune or gastrointestinal disease. A vet can help you diagnose the causes of skin issues and prescribe treatments to address the underlying conditions.Vets can also help identify the causes of frequent itching. In general, if your Pittie itches all year round, it probably has a food allergy. If its itching tends to take place at a particular time of year, it likely has a seasonal allergy. If it’s constantly itching for short, intense periods, your APBT may well be extra-sensitive to fleas.
 You can help keep your Pittie’s coat and skin healthy by feeding it a diet that’s rich in essential fatty acids, such as vitamin E, omega-6, and omega-3. Check to see that your regular pet food contains these plant- and meat-based nutrients.Most high-quality “complete and balanced” dog kibbles will already contain essential fatty acids. If yours doesn’t, consider giving your Pittie a fish oil supplement to boost its omega-3 intake.

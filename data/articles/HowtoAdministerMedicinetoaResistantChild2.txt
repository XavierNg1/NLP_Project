 One method is to place the pill on the back of the tongue, and have the child drink water or a favorite drink of hers—such as a fruit juice. Have her gulp the drink quickly and focus on the drink flavor.Keep the child’s head level or bent forward slightly. Using a straw for the drink also helps.
 This is one way to break up the dose for easier swallowing. Use a knife or pill cutter to split the pill in half or quarters. You can also crush the pill between two spoons into a powder and mix it into a small amount of a favorite food of the child’s that requires no chewing (ice cream, pudding, yogurt, etc…).Just make sure you mix it into a manageable amount of food — she must eat all of the food to get the full dose.


Crushing the pill can be done more easily if you wet the pill with a drop or two of water and let it sit for five minutes.

Do not attempt this with slow-release capsules or pills with special coatings. If you destroy the slow release capability of the pill and it delivers a single, large dose, this can be extremely dangerous for your child. Ask your doctor and pharmacist if you are uncertain.
 Ask your doctor and pharmacist before attempting this, as not all capsules are meant to be opened. The contents can be swallowed without chewing, and are usually bitter, so need to be mixed with the child’s favorite sweet foods (applesauce, yogurt, or the like).This can be messy. You don’t want to risk losing the ingredients. Make sure you have a clear and dry workspace to empty the contents onto.
 For children over the age of eight and unable or unwilling to take pills they can practice when not sick or upset. Provide the child with a small piece of candy or ice for them to suck on. Use something that will melt quickly to avoid items getting stuck in the child’s throat.Work up to candies the size of M&Ms. You can try a thin coating of butter if stickiness is still an issue.

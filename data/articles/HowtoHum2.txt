 For this technique, you will change the point of resonance of the hum to better project the sound of your voice. Start humming. Make a note of where you feel the vibrations from the sound most strongly.


You should be able to “follow” the humming vibrations as they carry through the throat, nose and mouth.
 Continue vocalizing, keeping your mouth closed and your jaw relaxed. Now, as you hum, allow your throat to expand as though you were coughing or attempting to hit the lowest note you possibly can. Your larynx will tighten and draw downward.Getting your throat in the right position is not as easy as it sounds. Work on lowering the pitch of the notes as you hum and try to feel when your larynx sinks. With a little practice, you’ll get the hang of it.
 You are now in a better position to project the hum through your mouth. Let the vibrations fill your cheeks. Push with your diaphragm as you exhale. If you feel a tickle in your lips or the lower portion of your face begins to tingle, you’re doing it right.Keep your lips tightly sealed so that the sound is amplified by your throat and the hollows of your cheeks.
Projecting through the mouth lets you hum, and therefore sing, with greater volume and clarity.
 Now that you’re able to project the vibrations of your vocal cords through your mouth, try to hum more forcefully. Squeeze your diaphragm to push more air out and keep your throat opened up. You should be able to achieve a louder, more booming hum this way than the thin, nasally quality of the basic technique of humming through the nose.Most of your volume should come from the diaphragm, not the voice box. It is only being conducted through the mouth.This is the “right” way to hum as a trained singer.

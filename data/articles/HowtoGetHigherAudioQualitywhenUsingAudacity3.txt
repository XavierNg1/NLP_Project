 If your audio goes outside the decibel range Audacity allows for, then it will clip, resulting in unpleasant quality. Always remember that clipping can happen with your overall audio, not just individual samples.
 If bass sounds are too heavy, they can overpower the rest of the audio or may sound bad on many subwoofers. If treble sounds are too heavy, they can drown out any bass.
 Use the preview function when adding effects to your samples. Different levels of the same effect can be the difference between high quality audio and low quality noise.

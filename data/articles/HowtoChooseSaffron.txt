 These are:


Saffron threads

Saffron tips; and
Saffron powder.;
, High quality saffron threads will appear dark red - the redder, the better. There should be no colour variation. If the yellow style can be viewed, it means that it hasn't been removed and while it has no culinary benefit, it certainly adds to the weight.However, few producers will go to that extra effort, so it's probably best to get used to it.


Powdered saffron is harder to discern with colour and it is the easiest form of saffron to adulterate. It will look a little lighter in colour than the saffron threads or tips. If it comes from a reputable brand or merchant, it should be fine.
 It should smell sweet, with a floral-type aroma.
 There are different ways of using these, so the choice will really depend on your own preference, and you may even like to have both available in your pantry.


Threads: These can be separated out one by one and used decoratively. Chefs like the fact that you can tell it's a saffron thread on a dish.Saffron powder: This doesn't require steeping and is easy to add with a pinch.
 Place it into a glass jar and keep it in a cool, dark, and dry place.

 Think of extra-thick French fries, and you'll have the right idea of the size needed. Place on folded paper towels and cover with more paper towels. This step will wick away a lot of the moisture. If you like, you might even apply some weight like a plate. Taking away some moisture will give it a chewier texture and eliminate splatter when you fry them. (Don't discard the paper towels. Let them air dry and you can reuse them to wipe up spills.);
, Marinate the tofu in sauce for 30 plus minutes, depending on how flavorful you want it. If you removed some of the moisture, it will absorb the marinade quicker.
 Add salt and pepper to taste.
, Fry the tofu strips until golden brown. Remove when cooked.


If they seem greasy, place on kitchen towel to soak up any extra grease.
 Simply mix all of the ingredients together and it's ready to go.
 Dip tofu sticks into the dip and enjoy!

 You can use matching patterns or colors, or contrasting ones. You can even use a solid-colored bandana and a coordinating patterned one., Stack the bandanas with the wrong sides facing in and the right sides facing out. Trace a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) square onto each corner. Cut the squares out with sharp fabric scissors.Be sure to cut through both bandanas at the same time.
 The fringe needs to be 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) deep and 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide. Be sure to cut through both bandanas at the same time. This ensures that the tassels are even., A square knot is similar to a double knot: cross the left strand over the right one and knot it, then cross the right strand over the left one, and knot it again.

If you can't do a square knot, you can do a double knot instead. It won't be as durable, however.
 Always tie the top tassel to the matching bottom tassel. Do the entire bottom edge and both of the side edges.If you are using pillow stuffing, tie all of the tassels together except for the last five on the top edge., You can also use an old throw pillow that is a similar size. The pillow will fit snuggly into the bandana.You do not need to turn the pillow case inside out; the tied fringe is part of the design!

If you can't find a pillow form, insert pillow stuffing or polyester stuffing.
 Make sure that there are no gaps between the two bandanas. The pillow is very full, so you may need to squish it a little.

 Add only enough dressing so that it comes about 3/4 of the way up the side of the beef.;
, Cook until the meat can be separated with a spoon. There should be enough liquid in the cooker to avoid drying out the meat, so leaving the meat in for too long shouldn't be a problem.
 When the meat is done, remove it from the slow cooker, leaving the juices in the cooker. Shred the meat, then return it to the slow cooker. With the lid off, turn the slow cooker to high for about 30 minutes to reduce the juices, which will concentrate and maximize the flavor.
 Enjoy!

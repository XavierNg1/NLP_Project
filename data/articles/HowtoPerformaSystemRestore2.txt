If you’re unable to access Windows at all, restart again and repeatedly tap the F8 key to open the “Advanced Boot Options” menu. You have to be quick or else you may miss your chance, so if the menu doesn’t appear just reboot and try again.
Use the ↑+↓ keys to find “Repair Your Computer.” Press ↵ Enter.
Choose your language, press ↵ Enter, then log in as an administrator.
Click “System Restore,” then “Next.” You’ll see a list of restore points as options. Choose a date and click “Next,” then “Finish” to begin the restore.
 In the Start menu, select “Control Panel,” then “System and Security.” Click “System” to access this panel.



For example, if Windows Update ran two days ago, your system (unless you chose otherwise) created a system restore point so that you could restore if the update causes problems.
Some of the restore points were created automatically and have no associated events.
 Choose a date to restore to and click “Next,” then “Finish.” The system will now restore to that date and restart when it’s ready.


If your restore is failing, try running it again, but this time in Safe Mode by pressing F8 repeatedly on boot, then selecting “Safe Mode.”
If you made a System Repair Disc at some point, try rebooting the computer with the disc in the CD-ROM drive and selecting “System Restore” from the recovery options.

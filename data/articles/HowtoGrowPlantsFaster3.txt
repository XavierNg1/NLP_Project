 If you are growing plants outside, but you have to wait for spring, grow your seeds inside. Seedlings take between 4 to 12 weeks to sprout. If you let them sprout inside and then transplant them into your garden, the plants will grow 4-6 weeks earlier than if you had waited to plant the seed directly into the flower bed.Gather a small group of containers that are 2–4 inches (5.1–10 cm) deep that have drainage holes.
Avoid fertilizers. Instead, use a mix of peat moss and vermiculite inside the container.
Let the plants set outside in their containers for a few hours each day. Do this for at least two weeks before you transplant them into the flower bed. This will help them acclimate to direct sunlight.
The best plants to transplant are tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and melons. Some plants, however, do not transplant well. These are zucchini, beans, beets, corn, spinach, turnips, and peas.
 Studies show that plants respond particularly well to being serenaded. When you are fertilizing the plant, talk or sing to the plant. Record your voice using a device such as a radio or tape recorder and play it to them while you're gone. This will help your plant grow faster.
 Use a grow light if you are growing your plant indoors. The best grow lights are high-intensity discharge lights (HID). HID lights come in two types: metal halide (MH) and high-pressure sodium (HPS). MH bulbs cast the strongest light in the blue end of the spectrum, which causes a compact, leafy growth. HPS bulbs last longer than MH bulbs and produce light at the red/orange end of the spectrum. MH bulbs cause a flowering growth., Coffee grounds help plants grow faster because of their caffeine. If you drink coffee, put the grounds in your plant instead of throwing them away. The grounds are rich in nitrogen, which is a key nutrient in a plants diet. There have also been studies that suggest that caffeine helps the plant grow faster.

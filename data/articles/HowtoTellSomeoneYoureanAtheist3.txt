 Most people will be able to come out as atheist with little more than a few tense conversations. In some cases, however, your job may depend on your religion. Other times, certain religions will excommunicate anyone who is a non-believer. You need to remove yourself from these situations by finding a new job and putting in a support system before coming out as atheist.Once you are ready to end judgemental relationships, simply say something like “I have a right to live my life as I see fit, and I will no longer allow other people to decide what I believe or how I portray myself.” Keep calm and do not fight or argue with the person. Say what you need to say and don’t go back into that relationship.
 Having a support system is crucial to being happy. In the case of being atheist, it helps to have other atheists that can relate to your experiences as a non-believer. Look for local atheist groups, or join internet communities of atheists if you don’t know any atheists personally.It is nice to have a support system of other atheists, but you can also rely on the support of your open minded friends and family.
 Opening up as an atheist can do wonders for your happiness, but you also have to respect the religions of others. Co-workers, family members, and friends will not instantly convert when you come out, and sometimes they will even be downright annoying in the interest of “saving your soul.” Be prepared to turn down invitations to church and other religious events, and to be asked to explain your belief and reasons often (though you do not have to oblige).You can respectfully leave any conversation that makes you uncomfortable by saying something like “Excuse me, I think I should be going now.” If someone is not respecting you, it is best to get out of the situation rather than engage in an argument about spirituality.

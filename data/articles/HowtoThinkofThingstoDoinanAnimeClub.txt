 Cosplaying is always fun! You shouldn't cosplay everyday, maybe just once a month. You can have contests, re-enact scenes, etc.;
, After you can talk about it, what you liked, what you didn't like, etc. Be careful because there might be some arguments.
 Have everyone draw some anime fan-art, and you can pick three winners!

, Some of these are Pok√©mon, Legend of Zelda, Kingdom Hearts, etc.
 Go over the rules, they can be found at http://www.pokemon.com/ Have a tournament and see who wins!

,,,, You will need money, so keep that in mind. Maybe your club could have a fund raiser for the convention.

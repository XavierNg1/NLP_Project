 In a blender over high, combine the following ingredients:


4 garlic cloves, minced
1 jalapeño, seeded and minced
1 tsp (5 ml) ground cumin seed
1/2 cup (125 ml) chopped fresh cilantro
Salt and pepper, to taste
1/4 cup (60 ml) lime juice
2 Tbsp (30 ml) white vinegar
1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) sugar
1/2 cup (125 ml) olive oil

, Allow the meat to marinade for anywhere from one hour to one day. After 4 hours, the difference in taste becomes pretty much negligible. Do not marinade for longer than one day.
 After you've gotten your coals red hot, dump them into your grill. Safely move all the charcoals over to one side, effectively creating a hot side and a cooler side. You'll use the cooler side to cook the carne asada for most of the process, and then sear the meat on the hot side at the very end to develop color and extra flavor.
 Start the meat off on the cooler side of the grill, keeping the lid closed, but flipping often. Check the steak periodically with a thermometer — or use the finger test — to test for doneness.


120° F (48.8° C) = Rare
130° F (54.4° C) = Medium rare
140° F (60° C) = Medium
150° F (65.5° C) = Medium well
160° F (71.1° C) = Well done

, Use this opportunity to give the steak good color and added flavor.
 Your steak will continue to cook even after it has been removed from the grill.


Don't underestimate the importance of letting the steak rest. If you cut up the steak right away, it will give up all its juices, creating a drier steak. If you let the steak rest for at least 5 minutes, however, it will remain moist and flavorful even after cutting into it.
 Top with onion relish and tomatillo salsa.

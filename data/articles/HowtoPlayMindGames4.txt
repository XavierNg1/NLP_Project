 Most people do not like to claim defeat, or admit when something becomes too hard for them to do. By presenting undesirable tasks in certain ways, you can easily convince someone to agree to what you want.


If you want someone to shovel snow from your driveway, you may ask, "Can you keep shoveling the driveway or do you need me to do it? If you can't handle it, then it is okay, I can."
By offering to take over the thing you want that person to continue doing, you provide that person with the idea that you are kind and willing to help. When you add in the statement about not being able to handle the situation, that person will continue to shovel to avoid admitting defeat.
 If you show someone that you care about their well-being, or you want to have him or her as a friend, it will naturally invite that person into your life.


Do someone a favor. When you go out of your way for another person, that person will feel indebted to you and will want to return the favor.Find a way to help someone out, and then after you have completed the task, ask for a favor. It will be hard for that person to turn you down.
 A great way to influence the way someone makes a decision, is to make that person fear a situation enough to be willing to do whatever you say to avoid it from happening.If you want someone to start exercising with you, give statistics about how not working out can lead to terrible health problems. Then, explain how you can teach that person great exercises to avoid getting those health problems.
 If you're dealing with people who are driven by desire, simply explain an easy way to obtain what they want. Tell them how to easily make more money, get a job promotion, or buy a better car. Making them believe they can have brighter futures by doing what you say is an easy way to play mind games.

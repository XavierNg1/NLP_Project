 You will need a Mozilla Persona account for this step.;
,,,, If this pane is not showing, make sure you select the event you added by clicking it in the track timeline.



The "Start" and "End" values indicate when the Google map you added will start displaying and when will it disappear. The time values are relative to the beginning of the video. That is, 0 is the start of the main video, 10 is 10 seconds after the main video starts, and so on.

The "Map Type" field allows you to select the type of map you want to add. You can select between:


Road Map (default selection)

Satellite.

Street View - Not available for all parts of the world.

Hybrid - a mix of different views.

Terrain.

Stamen - Watercolor.

Stamen - Terrain.
Stamen - Toner



The "Location" field is where you input the name of the place you want to be initially highlighted/centered in the map.

The "Full Screen" option check-box makes the map takes the whole area of the video. Of course, if the map is on a "bottom" layer, it might still be hidden by "higher" events in the stack of tracks/layers.

The "Zoom" Field is, as obvious, where you set how much zoomed the map will initially be. the default is 5.

The "Transition" field allows you to set the animation used to show the map when it first appears. Available options are: None (no animation), Pop, Fade, Slide Up, and Slide Down.
 Adjust the event's properties accordingly.

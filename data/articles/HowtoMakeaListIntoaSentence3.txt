 For instance, if Alex was supposed to buy chicken broth but could also buy beef or vegetable broth instead, the you could write it this way as a sentence:


Please buy chicken, beef, or vegetable broth. This sentence indicates that any of these alternatives is okay.
Use “etc.,” “including,” “such as,” or “and so on.” to show the list is not inclusive. For instance, in the example of the grocery list, maybe the list maker wants to tell Alex to buy salad ingredients but doesn’t need to specify exactly which ones:
Buy the ingredients for salad, such as lettuce, tomatoes, and dressing.
Alternatively, it could be: Buy lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, and so on to make a salad.
Or: Buy lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, etc. to make a salad
Or: Buy ingredients for salad, including lettuce, tomatoes, and dressing.
Use a colon before the list if the text before it is a complete sentence. For example, you could write:
Please buy the following ingredients: lettuce, tomatoes, and dressing.
 For example, you could write:


She likes to eat pies like cherry, apple, and strawberry; to buy ice cream flavors like rocky road, vanilla, and cheesecake; and to make cookies like chocolate chip, snickerdoodle, and molasses.
Because the items in the list have their own commas, they are actually separate lists all their own. That is, “pies like cherry, apple, and strawberry” is its own list. Therefore, it’s confusing to have a comma after it, as the reader may not be clear where that list ends and the bigger list begins. In this instance, and others like it, using semi-colons is more appropriate.

 How would you like the bowl or container to look once it's completed? Are you setting the scene for a classic tea party or are you creating centerpieces for a bridal shower or wedding? Maybe it's meant to fit in with existing rustic or frilly d√©cor, in which case, there may be a pattern theme you'd like to replicate.


A simple design is to wrap the lace around the base or the top of the bowl and leave it at that.
A more complicated design could involve several lines of lace around the bowl.
A very complicated design would involve cutting the lace into an actual shape, such as a flower, a boat or an animal.;
, The type of lace or eyelet fabric you're going to use will help you to communicate your design intent. Do you want something on the frilly side or more of a classic, understated pattern? Color is important too, since lace comes in a variety of shades and hues.

 Use an electric drill and an eight-inch drill bit to do this. Drill holes into the bottom of the wheelbarrow, as well as the sides (about three to four inches up the sides). Drill as many holes as you can to turn your wheelbarrow into a strainer.If you do not have an electric drill, you can rent one from your local hardware store.;
, Only fill a quarter of the wheelbarrow with gravel. This way the water will be able to easily drain through the gravel as you rinse it., Turn on your hose and begin rinsing the gravel. As you rinse the gravel, use your shovel to move it around. This way you can ensure all sides of the gravel are rinsed.Rinse the gravel for 30 seconds to a minute.
 Lay a geotextile fabric on the grass. Wheelbarrow the clean gravel over to the fabric and pour it on top. Spread the gravel on the fabric until it is one to two inches high. It should take about an hour to dry in the sun.Geotextile fabric is a special type of fabric that contains tiny holes, which enable water and other debris to drain. You can find it at your local hardware store.
The size of the fabric depends on how much gravel you have. Just make sure the fabric can fit all of your gravel.

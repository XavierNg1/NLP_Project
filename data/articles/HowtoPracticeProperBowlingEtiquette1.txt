 If you wear street shoes, you risk ruining the approaches and/or the equipment.

When you are putting your bowling shoes on, be sure that you move them as far away from walkways as possible, to avoid anyone tripping on them.
If your street shoes are wet or dirty, be sure that you take them off as far away from the lanes as possible. If you track water, mud, or anything else onto the lanes, then you run the risk of you or someone else falling flat on their face.;
, Something as simple as a drop of water could easily create a big hazard. Eat or drink either at a seating area that is usually located behind the general bowling area, or simply just away from all of the lanes., Even if you were really upset about a missed strike, remember that especially if you are at an open bowling session, and there are families with children there, they can likely hear you and it may cause them to be uncomfortable., If it is not your turn, either go to the seating area behind you or step out of any bowlers' ways. This can be an annoyance, especially if they were in the middle of throwing their ball and you walked in front of them., If for whatever reason you need to use it, ask them politely, and make sure that you have a good reason. If they end up saying no, respect that and move on.

If you need to use another person's ball because your ball is stuck, then simply let the next bowler on your lane know. Their ball may hit it, or theirs may become stuck too. If their ball becomes stuck too, go up to a worker and tell them that you have a couple of bowling balls that are stuck. It may take awhile to get them back, but it may also avoid someone from becoming upset that their ball was used.

 One way to help alleviate the stress is to practice breathing exercises. Deep breathing can help relax you, clear your mind, and help you eliminate negative, stressful thoughts.This aids your obsession with productivity by helping you take a step back, reconsider what’s important, and reduce the stress you’re piling on yourself by being obsessed with getting things done.


You can do something as simple as abdominal breathing. Sit up straight in your chair with your feet on the floor. Inhale through your nose, breathing so that abdomen expands. Place a hand on your belly and wait for it to move as you inhale. Hold for a count of four, then release slowly, your abdomen flattening as you expel all the air.
 If you are struggling with breaking your obsession with productivity, you can try going to therapy. There are therapy options for people who are workaholics. You can try one-on-one therapy, group therapy, or even family therapy.In therapy, your therapist might use cognitive-behavior therapy, a treatment where a therapist helps you learn how to replace negative thoughts and behaviors with more positive ones. They might be able to help you change the way you think about work and personal time.
 One of the problems with being obsessed with work is never taking the time to rest and relax. You are always worried or thinking about what you have to get done. This causes unneeded stress. It also affects your efficiency, your creativity, and even your productivity.Give yourself breaks during the work day. Get up and walk around the office, meditate, do breathing exercises, or do a stress-relieving activity for a few minutes.
Take naps during your off time. There is nothing wrong with resting and relaxing when you aren’t at work.
Disconnect from everything. Spend time away from your computer, tablet, cell phone, and e-mail. Spend time letting your brain relax from the stress of work.

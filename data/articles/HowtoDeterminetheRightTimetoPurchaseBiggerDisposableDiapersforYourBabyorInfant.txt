 The child could be crying because the diapers are too small to fit around their waistline, and they feel cramped.Look for the child's diaper to be super-saturated in urine, which may make the child feel uneasy and feel "cramped" inside the diaper all the time.

 Continue to use your current diapers, but help pull out the leak-guards better from the side walls of the diaper when you unfurl the diaper and get it ready for use. When opening the diaper, run two consecutive fingers of one of your hands up the entire length of the edges of the inside linings (in tandem on the inside of the diaper) of the diaper. This will help release the static cling from the manufacturing process at the diaper factory on the production date.

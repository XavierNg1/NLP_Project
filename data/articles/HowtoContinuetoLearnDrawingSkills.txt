 A sketchpad, all varieties of pencils, rubber, etc.;
, These will help you dramatically and boost your confidence working alongside and around other people at the same level as you. If you do not feel like going to art classes go to your local library or log onto Amazon and get some books that teach you how to draw or how to draw on the right side of your brain. If you’re really willing to invest in yourself do both.
 It could be any household item, e.g. a 2 liter (0.5 US gal) bottle. Remember to draw just what you see, not what is in your mind, don’t make things up on paper. Draw the shadings, reflections, curves, etc. Draw it at the best ability you can. The longer you work on it, the better it will be, but don't overdo it. When you first start out, try for 1 to 2 hours. Keep that bottle, keep your drawing and store it in a folder or something. The next day draw that bottle again in exactly the same position and put that drawing with the other one, remembering to put a date on it. Carry on doing this every day for a few months, never miss a day. By the end of those few months you will be almost exactly like a professional at drawing what you drew. Look at your first drawing and last drawing and you will see how good you have become.
 Your brain is clever. People are not born to draw or not draw. Apart from the 1 in a billion prodigy children/people who claimed they have gifts. But no one on this Earth cannot draw. Even people without arms can draw with their feet or mouth. You can draw. You just need to practise and your brain will unfold your miracle talent. Practise drawing everything around you. Do not make things up on paper, draw what you see and everything will come naturally.
 Practice every day. If you really want to draw, try spending 3-4 hours a day drawing. Even if you're rubbish at it, you will get better.

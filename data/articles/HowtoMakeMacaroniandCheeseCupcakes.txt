 Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit or 175 degrees Celsius. Grease a cupcake tray with non-stick cooking spray or butter to prevent the cupcakes from sticking to the tray.;
, In a large pot of salted water, boil the dry elbows until soft and slightly firm. The time it takes to cook depends on your package's cooking instructions. For most pastas, it should take about 7-10 minutes. Drain the pasta in a colander once fully cooked.
 Return the macaroni back to the pot. Crack the egg and add it to the elbows. Then slowly pour the softened butter. Use a wooden spoon to combine until well-coated. The elbows should be slightly buttery when combined thoroughly.
 First, add the shredded mozzarella cheese. Use the wooden spoon to blend until the cheese melts and the macaroni is creamy. Then add only 1 cup of the sharp cheddar cheese. The color will result into a bright, orange color and the macaroni will feel sticky.
 Splash in the milk to the macaroni and cheese and incorporate the pasta with a wooden spoon. Mix until the macaroni is smooth and not as sticky as before.
 Use a mini ice cream scoop to place the macaroni and cheese into each case into the tray. Sprinkle the remaining Â½ cup of cheddar cheese and the breadcrumbs on top of the cupcakes.
 Place the macaroni and cheese cupcakes in the oven have them bake for about half and hour, until the edges are brown and crispy. The tops of the cupcakes should also be slightly brown. Remove the cupcakes from the oven once fully baked.
 Before you remove the cupcakes from the tray, have them cool for about 10 minutes. That way the cheese can set and the cupcakes can remain in its shape.
 Remove the cupcakes from the cupcake tray and serve them on a serving plate. Consider serving these cupcakes with homemade chicken nuggets and/or a salad.

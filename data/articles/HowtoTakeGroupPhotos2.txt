 All cameras are different, but most have some kind of timer settings that allow you set up the camera and join the group before the picture is taken.


Some cameras even come with a remote feature that allows you to take pictures by clicking the remote rather than figuring out the timer process., Instead of having to find an object to prop the camera on and awkwardly adjust until it is pointing in the right direction, use a tripod. These hold the camera firmly in place and are adjustable to any angle. So you will always be able to aim at exactly the picture you want to capture.
 Look through the camera’s lens and make sure everyone is in the frame. If anyone is standing too far outside the camera’s view, tell them to move so that they’ll be in the picture. You can also check that everyone looks acceptable (hair in place, no ruffled clothing, etc.).
 The more people there are in a photo, the harder it is to get a good shot of everyone. Someone will inevitably blink or sneeze or look away. This problem gets exponentially worse when people don’t know when the exact moment of the picture will be. If you know your camera takes the photo after five seconds, you need to count out loud to five so everyone can be prepared.Many cameras have a flash feature that warns you when it is about to take the picture. Just make sure that everyone knows what to look for (the flash) so that they can be prepared when it is time for the picture.

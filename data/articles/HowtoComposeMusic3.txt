 You don't have to follow all of them exactly - in fact, some of them can just be omitted if you don't need them for the kind of music you play. But do follow the general outline and ideas.
 Any one works. If you're writing a progressive song, then you have the option of picking more than one, just make sure the two aren't the same thin. Check out the notes in each scale and make sure that they are significantly different. The chromatic scaleis usually sonically pleasing.
 The major scale starting from the first "degree" is as follows: major, minor, minor, major, major, minor, diminished, seventh, ninth. Add chords of two to four notes to some melody notes to produce harmony.
 Don't overdo and try to "display all your talent," especially if the tempo of the song doesn't call for it. Try different beats and speeds, known as tempo, of the beats from an electronic drum source. Start with a slow tempo and insert the melody into the rhythm.
 If you're writing an upbeat song, you can use full or barre chords, power chords or both. If you're writing a slow, calm song, only use full/barre chords, or there will be nothing in the song worth listening to. If you're going for the heavy metal song, then you can use the higher note/bass note patterns that "At the Gates" popularized for flavor or groove, although it's not recommended that you do it a whole lot or else you'll seem like you're hopping on the mallcore train), power chords can provide the chord progression, and full/barre chords can add something different.
 Bass can follow the chord progression, but also has the option of doing whatever as long as it stays in the key everyone else is playing in. Keyboards or pianos generally follow the chord progression, although some bands have keyboardists that follow the lead guitar part.
 Come up with the chorus, bridge, etc. Progressive songs don't necessarily need the song structure .

 As with the decomposition method, this is going to help us identify candidates for the b term. In this example, a is 8 and c is 2.8 * 2 = 16

, This step is identical to the decomposition method - we're testing and rejecting candidates for the constants. The product of the a and c terms is 16, and the c term is 10:2 * 8 = 16
8 + 2 = 10

, Take our two numbers from the previous step - let's call them h and k - and put them into this expression:((ax + h)(ax + k))/ a

Here, we'd get:((8x + 8)(8x + 2)) / 8

, In this example, we're seeing if (8x + 8) or (8x + 2) can be divided by 8. (8x + 8) is divisible by 8, so we'll divide this term by a and leave the other one as is.(8x + 8) = 8(x + 1)

The term we're saving out of here is what's left after dividing by the a term:
(x + 1)

, In this example, the second term, has a GCF of 2, since 8x + 2 = 2(4x + 1). Combine this answer with the term you identified in the previous step. These are your equation's factors.2(x + 1)(4x + 1)

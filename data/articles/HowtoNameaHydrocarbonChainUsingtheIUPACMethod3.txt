 An alkene is a hydrocarbon chain that contains one or more double bonds between carbons, but no triple bonds. The suffix at the end of an alkene should always be -ene.
, The parent chain of an alkene must contain any double bonds between carbons. Additionally, it should be numbered from the end that is nearest to a carbon-carbon double bond.
 In addition to noting where substituents are on an alkene chain, you must also note where the double bond is. Do this such that the lowest number on the double bond is used.
 If your parent chain has two double bonds, your name will end in "-diene." Three is "-triene," and so on.
 As with alkanes, you must list substituents alphabetically in the final name. Exclude prefixes such as di-, tri- and tetra-.

 Remove the pits from 1 1/2 pounds (about 3 cups or 675 g) of sweet cherries. Put them in a blender or food processor and pulse the cherries until they're pulpy. Scoop the cherries into a non-reactive saucepan.The cherries don't need to be completely smooth, since you'll puree the ketchup again after it's seasoned.
 Pour 1/3 cup (80 ml) of apple cider vinegar into the saucepan along with 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, 3/4 cup (150 g) of sugar, one 3-inch (7.5 cm) cinnamon stick, 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger, and 1 whole star anise. Stir the seasonings into the cherries., Turn the heat on to medium and stir the ketchup mixture constantly until it starts to bubble. Turn the heat down to medium-low and put the lid on. Cook the ketchup for 30 minutes. Take the lid off every once in a while and stir the ketchup as it cooks.Don't worry if the ketchup mixture looks thinner than tomato ketchup at this point.
 Turn the heat off and take off the lid. Carefully scoop out and throw away the cinnamon stick and star anise. Pour the ketchup into a deep storage container and insert an immersion blender. Blend the ketchup until it's smooth. Store the ketchup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one month.Keep in mind that the chipotle cherry ketchup may become a little spicier over time, since the flavors will continue to develop.

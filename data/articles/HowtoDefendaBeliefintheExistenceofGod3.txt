, The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics states that entropy always increases in closed systems unless external energy is used to "clean it up", similar to how cleaning up a room requires your energy. Entropy, for the most part, means disorder. An example is about breaking down rocks to pebbles and to sand, dissolving, oxidizing, mineral deposits, poison, corrosion, erosion, and rot. Evolution depends on disorder such as mutations but then devolves to order, which is in contrast of the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. While some may use escape hatches, such as that the organisms themselves are not closed systems, or that the Earth is not a closed system because it gets energy from the sun, the Sun is not intelligently affecting the Earth in a meaningful way, unlike a person cleaning up a room. Evolution is not surely proven because nothing in science will ever be proven, as the scientific method means that a better alternative to evolution may be found. God can override laws as he wishes, after all, He made laws but is not bound or limited by them.

, Entropy merely resolves to equilibrium.,, How much creativity was in that -- over eons of time, settling to equilibrium.
 Massive force so great it's not over yet? The universe is said to still be expanding from that explosion.
 What went boom? Where did that object come from? So how many competing "big bangs" are there out there right now? How do you know?


Obviously there is something much bigger than our known "expanding universe".

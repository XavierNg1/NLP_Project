 Ideally, the hanger will have a little hook on each side of the body. You can still use this method if you hanger doesn't have hooks, but the hooks will make wrapping the lights much easier.
, Gradually work your way to the other side of the hanger, then work back to the original side. You'll probably have to do this a few times to get the whole string on the hanger.
 Make sure you leave enough string at the end to reach the last hook.If there isn't enough room or your hanger doesn't have hooks, just tuck the end in between the strands of lights.
 You can either place the lights in a box, or, since this is a hanger, you can hang it conveniently out of the way until next Christmas.


If storing with other items, make sure to wrap the hanger in tissue paper for protection.

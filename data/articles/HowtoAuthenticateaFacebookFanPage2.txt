 Locate the blue app icon with an “f” on it on your mobile device’s home screen or app drawer. Tap to launch.
 If you logged out of your previous Facebook session, you will be asked to log in again. Type in your username and password on the text fields, and tap “Log in” to access your account.
 After logging in, you’ll be immediately directed to your account’s News Feed page. Tap the quick search bar at the top of the application screen and enter the name of the fan page you’d like to see.
 A list of closely related web pages will be displayed on a drop-down list, right below the quick search bar. Beside the name of the fan page, you’ll see a blue checkmark. This means that the said fan page has been validated by Facebook itself to be authentic.
 Tap the name of the fan page you like from the quick search bar to open and view its timeline right on your mobile device. Right beside the name of the page you’ll see the blue checkmark again as mentioned in step 4.

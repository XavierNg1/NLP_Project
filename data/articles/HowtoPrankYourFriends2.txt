 Your mission, if you choose to accept it for this simple physical prank, is to get the prankee to hit himself in the face. This will have many effects. It will make the prankee feel silly, be humorous to onlookers, and may even leave him thinking, "'How did I fall for that?'"

, The answer to this question isn't especially important; this is part of your prank! You're trying to distract attention from the possibility you are up to something with this question.


Keep a straight face when you're asking or else you might tip the prankee of your shenanigans!
If you have difficulty keeping a straight face, you might want to practice some emotional control exercises.
 You'll probably want to make up an excuse to explain what you are doing because you'll need to ask to see the prankee's hand. Hold his hand palm up, and with your finger draw the rough image of his favorite fruit. Some excuses you might use to explain what you are doing:


"I learned a real cool trick in my psychology class. You can actually trick the brain into imagining certain smells, like fruit. Here, let me show you."
"The other day I was hanging out with my fiend and he showed me this real cool magic trick. Can I show you?"
"I read about this silly trick online that's supposed to fool your nose into smelling something that isn't there. It didn't work on me. You want to give it a try? It's real easy."

, To do this, the prankee will have to bring the palm of his hand up to his face and up to his nose. You are now in striking distance of completing your prank.
 While the prankee is smelling his hand, hit it lightly so that he lightly smacks himself on the nose. You might want to follow this up with some good-natured heckling, saying things like:


"I can't believe you fell for that!"
"It's OK, I fell for that one, too. That's why I had to pull it on you!"
"I gotcha pretty good, didn't I?"

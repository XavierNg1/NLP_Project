  Have perfect, white teeth.  If your teeth are crooked, ask your parents to get you braces.  Don't get braces in really noticeable, bright colours.  Brush your teeth two times a day for 2 minutes and floss once at night.  Take a shower/bath everyday and use deodorant, if you need.;
,  Eat right.  Eat lots of fruits and vegetables and protein.  Don't drink too much soda or eat too much fast food/candy.  I know at this age you have really bad junk food cravings, but they're really bad for you.  Drink enough water to hydrate you.  Exercise everyday for at least 1 hour.  Go for a bike ride, play a sport, take a walk, anything at all!  Don't stay up so late.
  Leave it long.  Try to grow it out to around your waist and don't use too much heat or bleach on it.  Get regular trims to snip off split ends, if you get them.  Keep your natural colour or get some nice highlights.  Cut some bangs or cool layers.  Don't use too much heat or product on your hair for styling.  Ponytails, braids, buns, left down, and hair accessories are cool.
  Don't show off inappropriate skin, because your parents will yell at you and people will get the wrong impression of you.  Show off your legs and arms if the weather is appropriate, though.  Wear loose mini skirts, tank tops, skinny jeans, leggings, oversized sweaters, short shorts, cardigans, Uggs, sneakers, and anything you think is hot but comfy.
  When you slouch, no one is going to think you're attractive.  Keep your back straight, your head high, and your face neutral.  Don't stay statue straight, sort of curve your back in a C shape.  Sit with your legs together and your hands on your laps.  Swing your arms casually when you walk.  Look calm and casual.  You don't have to try so hard.  Looks are done!

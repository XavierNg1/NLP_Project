 What is its shape? Behavior? Color? Size? Does it have any special or unique features? For example, a fish might have a red dot on its tail.;
, It might help to write down the thoughts you had when looking at the fish, then write down everything related to those words/thoughts that come to mind. Be creative!

, You don't want to go back to "fishy" after all that work coming up with one.
 What made you pick this fish out of all the others? Does it have any distinctive qualities or behaviours that sets it apart from other fish just like it?

, For example, if your fish is a butterfly fish, try calling it something like Butter.
, Ask them, what is the first thing they think when they see your fish.


For example, if you have a clown fish, you could name it Ron like Ronald McDonald the clown.
For a Betta fish, you could name her Skylar, and call her Skye (like the blue sky).

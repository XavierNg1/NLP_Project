 Donate Life is a nonprofit organization that maintains organ donation registration information for many states across the country. As a matter of fact, many DMV websites will actually redirect to a Donate Life site in order for an individual to modify or change registration information.If you have the option (and you probably will), go to your state's Donate Life site rather than the national site, http://www.registerme.org. The state sites are usually more accurate, up to date, and functional.
 There will be section on the webpage that will say "update my donor profile," or "edit registration." Click this link.


After you follow the link, there will be a space for you to enter your name, date of birth, zip code, and driver's license number. Once you enter that information, it takes you to a page where you'll see all your donor information. There you can remove your name from the registry completely or prohibit certain organs from being donated. , Although there's a low probability it would be an issue, in an emergency situation, you don't want to take any chances you'd be mistaken for an organ donor. So even if you've updated your information with the registry itself, you need to update your ID.


Depending on your state's policy, you may have to pay for a replacement ID card.
 Just to be clear, your family can't override your wishes not to be an organ donor. Nonetheless, you should let them know about your decision. That way, in case you die without identification, there will be no confusion about what you want done with your organs.

 The horse must be confident and happy to be with you.;
, By putting a light contact on the lead rope and saying with your body language ‘I’m going to walk this way’ the horse will guess what to do.
 You should stop the horse and try again.
 This is how the horse learns that the action was correct.
 Just because the horse does an action once doesn’t mean he’s learnt it. He guessed the correct action and then got praise, but doesn’t know if the praise was for walking forward or for looking at you.

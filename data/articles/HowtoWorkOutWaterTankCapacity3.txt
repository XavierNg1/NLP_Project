 To determine the volume of a rectangular tank, multiply the length (l) times the width (w) times the height (h). The width is the horizontal distance from side to side. The length is the longest dimension, and the height is the vertical length from top to bottom.
 For rectangular tanks, the filled volume is simply the same length and width with a shorter height. The new height is the fill height, d. Therefore, filled volume is equal to the length times the width times the fill height.

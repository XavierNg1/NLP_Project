 Talk together about how to avoid drama and to not make mean comments.;
, Your friends really have turned up the drama, and you're stressed? Make a spot on Animal Jam to relax. If you're friends don't have ocean animals, try choosing an ocean spot to relax. Talk to another friend and see if you can relax there. Just be sure to have them lock it, so your friends don't follow you. That way, if your friends really get things heated, you can have a timeout.
 Try not to say anything like, "Just please get along!" or, "You started it first!". Instead, walk it off in the meditating spot. Be silent. If your friend hurts your feelings bad, they may not be a good friend in the first place. If a friend says something really rude about you, remove them. If a friend tries to re-buddy you, they may want to apologize. So, add them back at first. If they just do it to keep being mean, unbuddy them and don't re-buddy them again.
 If your friends keep finding you in places, you may have no other choice. Get off of animal jam and go on another site (such as wikiHow), go outside and play, or do something else you love to do offline.
 A simple, "I'm sorry," on Animal Jam seems a little mindless. So try, saying, "I'm truly sorry for (thing you did). You must've felt (feeling they could've had). What can I do to make it better?". Example, "I'm really sorry for saying I didn't like your outfit. You must've felt really sad. What can I do to make it better?" If your friends don't forgive you at first, give them a while to see if they change their mind. If they hold a grudge for more than two days, unbuddy them instead.

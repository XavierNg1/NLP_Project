 Most crocuses are planted in clumps of 6 to 12, because they are small flowers. You will get the most impact with a grouping.;
,, This is the best time to ready your planting project.
 Remember that the area will need to be sunny in spring, not just in fall.
 Loosen it with a spade and fork. Plant crocus bulbs near the borders of flowerbeds or under grass.


You can plant crocus bulbs directly into the lawn to naturalize them.
 If possible, allow the compost and soil mixture to sit in the area for two weeks.
 You need to plant the crocus corm at a depth double the bulb’s width. The bulbs themselves should be placed 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) apart.


Remember to plant the corms in clusters, rather than in a row. They will naturalize and spread more easily in this formation., This is a natural source of phosphorous and is great for root systems.
 Set it into the soil. Cover the bulb with dirt and pack it in lightly.
 Make sure the soil is well drained, so that the bulbs don’t rot in the ground.
 Wait until spring to continue caring for them.
 Since they come up in early spring, rain and snow may contain enough water to keep them healthy.
, Crocuses can last 20 years if properly cared for.

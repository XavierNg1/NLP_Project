 A container that has previously been opened may be difficult to open if the cap/lid is sealed tight with resin exposed to air.

Find out the date the can was bottled because resin has a short shelf life; even in sealed, airtight containers, it can become too viscous to effectively coat foliage and flowers.;
, It is important to find resin fluid that can be sprayed or air brushed through the nozzle or sprayer bottle directly to the foliage and flowers.

If the resin is too viscous to be sprayed onto the flower you can carefully sprinkle and pour small drops at a time (This will be further explained below).
,

Avoid breathing resin fumes. Resin has an extremely potent smell and just a small amount poured can fill a house with the smell for hours.
, Resin can cure and set quickly jamming and plugging your sprayer permanently if you don't disassemble and clean right away., The container bottle should have an information chart with the proper resin/catalyst ratio depending of the size and thickness of the cast., Pay close attention to safety tips and warnings.

Use caution while mixing and pouring solutions. When resin makes contact with the catalyst there is a chemical reaction which creates significant heat.
, The thinner and closer the petals and leaves are to each other will be more difficult to cast.

Some leaves and flowers are more difficult to cast because they are more delicate and could stick and clog-up to other leaves and petals.
Excessive heat and heavy resin layers could cause flowers to to curl, discolor and wrinkle.


It is difficult to spray with resin, you can dip thicker and less dense foliage and hang them dry with good results.

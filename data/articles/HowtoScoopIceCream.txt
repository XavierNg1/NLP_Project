 What you are looking for in a scoop is:


Good handle grip

Ergonomic
Won't slide very easily


Sharp edges (this makes for easy scooping)
Wide scoop (for maximum ice cream retrieval);
, Scoop your ice cream on the sideboard next to the sink. Put both scoops into a large coffee cup under running hot water long enough to heat them up for 20-30 seconds. If you're scooping ice cream for several kids/people, leave the water running at a trickle into the cup. Heating the scoops makes it easier to glide through the ice cream and ultimately speeds up the process.
 Using the side edge of your scoop, scoop in a circular motion or an "S" shaped motion, allowing for round, even scoops. Don't take too long-it will melt!

, When you have scooped out the ice cream, place it in a dish or a cone then drop that scoop back into the cup and grab the other. This way you always have a heated scoop handy. The ice cream falls from a heated scoop much more easily than from a cold one - thus using it for only one or two scoops before returning it to the heated water and grabbing the second one.

, Make sure each girl knows which cookies contain nuts, chocolate, etc, and which cookies are healthier (usually, there is at least one type of cookie that is fat free or low fat). If possible, obtain samples of each cookie so that each girl can offer their opinions on a particular cookie if a customer asks.
 Customers will buy more cookies if girls can clearly describe what the profits will be going toward - ie. camp or a trip, etc.
 Nicely asking for support is not enough. ALWAYS say, "Thank you anyway." or "Have a nice day."

 They can be fancy, personal notes, or just pieces of paper that say "Thanks". These will go in the bag with the cookies for the customers. Make sure your troop writes lots of them!

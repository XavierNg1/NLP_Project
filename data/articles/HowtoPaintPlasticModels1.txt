 Acrylic paints are one of the most popular types of modelling paints, and many hobby stores sell these. There are many brands, such as Humbrol, Revell and Tamiya. Acrylic paints are water-based and are therefore not toxic, so are good for young modellers. They also have lower odour, so can be used in less well ventilated areas, and as they are water-based, they can be cleaned and thinned with water. Acrylics also have a fast curing time of around about an hour.


Acrylics also have their disadvantages. Acrylics do not bond well on smooth surfaces, and to combat this, before painting, all the parts should be washed with soapy water, as well as primer being applied before. The short curing time is also a disadvantage, as it can leave brushstroke marks. They are also difficult to blend, and so airbrush effects are hard to achieve, and can only be removed with sandpaper.;
, The second and final major type of paint is enamel paint, and these are oil based, and can be toxic, so should only be used in well-ventilated areas. They have a long curing time of approximately 24 hours. They can only be thinned or cleaned with specialist thinners or white spirit, which can also be toxic.


Enamel paint sticks well to smooth surfaces, and is hard-wearing. The slow drying time allows the paint to be blended and one can achieve an airbrushed effect. The paint can also be stripped off quite easily with white spirit.
 Watercolour paints are used on models for weathering and can be reactivated with water, and watercolour pencils can also be used too. To make watercolour paints permanent, a layer of varnish must be put over the top.
 Lacquered paints are best applied with an airbrush, and although highly toxic, they dry instantly, and have a glossy sheen. They also need a specialist type of primer otherwise the paint would dissolve the plastic.

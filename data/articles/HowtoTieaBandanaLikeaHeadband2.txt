 One corner should be facing you. The patterned or most colorful side of the bandana should be facing down.
 Roll the corner up as far as you want the bandana to be wide. For example, if you want a 2-inch wide bandana, roll the top corner up 2 inches (5.1Â cm).
 Flip the portion you just folded over on top of the bandana to keep rolling. Try to maintain the same width as you go.
 Place it over your forehead or at the crown.
 Make sure it's tight enough that the bandana won't fall off.

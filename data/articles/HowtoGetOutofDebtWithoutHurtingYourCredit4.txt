 You might think the best way to manage debt is to obtain more credit. This is a huge mistake. Continuing to open credit cards or taking personal loans will only cause you to fall further in debt.


Also, creditors will assume you are in financial trouble if you apply to a bunch of credit cards at once. This will hurt your credit score.
An exception exists if you are getting a card or taking a loan to consolidate your other loans. In this situation, paying off your debt quickly with debt consolidation is worth the momentary credit hit.
 With debt settlement, you stop making payments to your creditors. Instead, you try to build up enough cash to offer your creditors a lump sum payment. If they accept the payment, they agree to settle your debt for less than face value.However, your credit score will tank because you have stopped making payments.
Your creditors might also sue you for failing to make timely payments. If they win the lawsuit, they can garnish your wages or seize your property.
On top of everything else, your creditors might not accept your lump sum offer. In that situation, all you have accomplished is harming your credit.
 Bankruptcy will also hurt your credit score. The exact impact will depend on how high your score was initially.However, most scores drop 130-240 points.Furthermore, bankruptcies stay on your credit report for years:

A Chapter 7 will stay on your report for 10 years.
A Chapter 13 will stay on your report for seven years after you complete the repayment plan.

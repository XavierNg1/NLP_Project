 Detergents should not be used on carpeting in general and are especially unnecessary on new carpeting. Detergents tend to leave behind residue that can damage carpeting. Avoid removing smell via detergents., Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) produce a lot of new carpet smell. Some people are very sensitive to VOC's and may have respiratory problems in response to new carpeting. If your health is affected by the smell of new carpeting, go for a VOC-free carpet., Cooking smells are easily absorbed into the carpeting. While this can mask the odor of new carpeting, it's hard to get the scent of food out of the carpet. If you use food to mask the smell, you may regret it later as your carpet will continue to smell like food for the long term., There is no way to completely eliminate new carpet odor. It simply takes a few weeks for the smell to fade. Be patient and give it time. If the new smell truly bothers you, try to stay out of the room with the new carpeting until the smell fades.You can also use some air fresheners and burn incense to mask the odor until the odor is gone.

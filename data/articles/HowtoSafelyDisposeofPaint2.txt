 Most old paints call for hazardous waste disposal.
 To speed up the process, stir in an absorbent material such as clay kitty litter, sawdust, or leftover concrete mix.


Never pour oil paint into a drain or into the ground. It is considered hazardous waste, and disposing of it this way is illegal.

 Grooming your poodle can create quite a mess, even if you are relatively careful during the process. You’ll want to bathe and groom your poodle somewhere that is easy to clean up – like the bathroom, in the garage, or outside (weather permitting).


Choose an area that works for you and get it ready with the towels, hair dryer, clippers, scissors, and anything else you may need.;
, Brush and comb your dog's coat out to where there are no mats. Washing a matted poodle is much harder to do. Use a dog brush to gently comb out your poodle’s hair and work on getting out all of the matted tangles.You should brush your poodle regularly (at least once a week) to keep its hair from getting matted between baths.
 Give your dog a bath in the bathtub. Be sure to use a nonslip surface in the bathtub, like a bath mat, to help your dog avoid slipping in the tub. Use shampoo made for dogs and gently lather and rinse it all throughout your poodle’s coat.Never use human shampoo on a dog. You need to buy shampoo that is specially formulated for canines.
To help your poodle’s coat remain extra soft, you may want to consider using conditioner on your poodle after shampooing. Simply lather and rinse the conditioner in the same way you use the shampoo.
 Squeeze out some of the excess water with your hands and then use a clean towel to towel dry the rest of the excess water. You can also let your poodle shake to get rid of some of the extra moisture. After this, use a hair blow dryer on the lowest setting to dry your poodle’s hair the rest of the way.Letting your poodle air dry is another possible option, but this will lead to curly ringlets rather than smooth, fluffy hair. To get the fluffy look, you must blow dry your poodle’s hair.

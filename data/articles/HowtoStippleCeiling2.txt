 You can rent or buy a pressurized paint gun and textured nozzle at most hardware stores. A textured hopper will look like a paint gun with a large funnel on the end of it.

Sprayers typically cost $225 to $400.Renting a paint gun and textured hopper will cost between $40 - $100 a day., Use a five-gallon bucket and mix your drywall compound with water. For the traditional drywall compound, use one part powder to six parts water and mix it together until it reaches a pancake batter-like consistency. If your drywall mixture is too thick, add more water until it loosens up.If you are having trouble mixing your compound by hand, use a drill and ribbon mixer.
 Load the hopper on the gun with the drywall mixture that you just created. Attach the gun to the air compressor and adjust the setting to 25 to 45 PSI. Once the gun is correctly hooked up and loaded, you can start painting. , Before trying to apply the texture to your ceiling, use a piece of cardboard so that you can get a feel for your paint spray gun. If your texture is too thin, add more of the drywall powder. If the paint is coming out too thick, add more water to your mixture.
 Move in slow deliberate sections of 6x6 feet (1.82 x 1.82 meters). If a part of your ceiling doesn't have enough texture, hold the gun and paint that part of the ceiling longer., Allow the paint to harden a little, but not enough to be completely dry. Once it's stiffened up, use a knock-down blade to press down the textured ceiling. A knock-down blade is a handheld tool with a flat edge that you can use to push down overly textured stipple.Using a knock-down blade over the entirety of your ceiling will give it a unified texture.
 After you've painted your ceiling, you'll need to wait a full day before it's all dried. Once it's dried, you can wash your ceiling as you normally would.

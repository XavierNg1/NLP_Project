 All activities come with internal and external expectations.The more activities your child is involved in, the more pressure they will feel trying to meet these expectations.This may cause depression, anxiety, consistent bad moods or quietness, and avoidance of friends and family.Correct this by speaking with your child. Ask them what activities they would like to drop from their schedule.
You might say something like, “I think we’ve been a little too busy lately. I know you like doing activities, but are there any you’re OK with stopping? It’s alright to cut back sometimes.”;
, You may have noticed that your kids have been looking and acting drained. They may complain of headaches and physical achiness. Disturbed or poor sleep are also common. These are emotional hints your child needs a break.Ask your child, “Why do you think you are frustrated/tired/etc.?” If they can’t think of a reason that makes sense, they may be overscheduled., With younger children especially, you’ll be in the driver’s seat when choosing activities, practice times, and so on. This might cause your child to lose their sense of self-purpose and become overly reliant on you. If your child seeks your direction for every little thing, cutting back may help.


If you child has free time, do you notice they lack imagination? Do your kids have difficulty setting their own schedule when left to their own devices? If you answered yes, your child is probably overscheduled.

 You may search for people, your friends, places, things, photos, pages, groups, apps, events, restaurants, and different kinds of entertainment such as music, movies or games. Facebook will then retrieve suggestions based on your keyword as well as what you are able to see of other people’s posts.


If you had searched for “comedy,” for instance, when you see the search results, you will see more search suggestions such as “Comedy photos,” “People who like comedy,” “Pages similar to comedy,” and “My friends who like comedy.” At the very bottom, you will see “See more results for comedy.”

, You will then see these tabs: All Results, People, Pages, Groups, Apps, and Events. All of those tabs will each bring up more results when you click on them. Click on the tab that you think will retrieve results that fit into what you are looking for.

 If you are making a soup, curry, or other liquid dish, the easiest option is to add more liquid. Pour out some of the salty liquid and discard it. Add water, unsalted broth, or milk, depending on the dish., Adding a completely new ingredient is a bold move, but can have high rewards. Acidic and sweet flavors are great choices to complement or obscure saltiness.Acidic ingredients work with almost any dish. Try citrus juice, vinegar, wine, tomato, or pickled foods.Besides plain sugar, you could add honey or condensed milk. This works best in combination with acid. Try adding 1 teaspoon (5mL) each of sugar and cider vinegar, then repeat until perfect., If you have the time and pantry supplies, add more ingredients. For instance, add more meat and vegetables to your stew, or unsalted butter to your sauce. This will reduce the ratio of salt to other flavors. This is the only way to fix an oversalted dough.


If you prefer more neutral flavors, grind cauliflower to a fine consistency and mix it into the liquid.
 You can add rice, pasta, or potatoes to almost any dish. Starch is not a special counter to sugar, but it is an easy way to increase the recipe size.


Don't believe the myth about letting a potato absorb salt from a broth, then throwing it away. The potato absorbs liquid as well as salt. The percentage of salt remains unchanged., Partially boiled vegetables can be rinsed and returned to less salty water. Rinsing can ruin the texture and flavor of steamed, baked, or stir-fried veggies, but may work if you catch the mistake soon after you begin cooking.
 Temperature affects taste in complex ways, but a cold dish can taste saltier than a hot one.If warming the dish isn't an option, consider serving it with a hot drink like coffee or tea instead.


This is a fairly minor effect. Combine it with other solutions.

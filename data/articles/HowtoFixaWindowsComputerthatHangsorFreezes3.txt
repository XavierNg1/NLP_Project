 A software compatibility problem may also be a contributing factor, especially if you recently installed an app or driver. You can try to remove it. If you're not able to, run a System Restore to return the system to a previous working state or another saved restore point before you installed the particular software/ application.

 This kind of malicious software may also result in random hangs in Windows. For this, you can run one or more of the online detection tools e.g., Microsoft Safety Scanner.

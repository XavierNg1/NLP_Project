 Many colleges require students to take electives as a part of their curriculum. Colleges often offer unique and fun classes including wine tasting, bowling, scuba diving, and self-defense classes.To take a break from demanding classes, try taking something that you will enjoy or learn a new skill.;
, College campuses are notorious for having a club to fit just about any interest. If you have a hobby or interest, try and find a club to join. Or, if you canâ€™t find one, create one!


Look around campus for flyers that advertise these clubs. Check high-traffic areas such as dorms, cafeterias, and/or classroom buildings.
 Sports can be a fun way to keep in shape and to meet new people. While you may or may not be able to get on the college football team, colleges often have amateur and co-ed sports clubs like hockey, soccer, or frisbee.
 Colleges may host special guest lecturers, celebrities, and/or bands. Watch your college special events page for more information on these events. Often, you can attend for free or a discount price.
 A number of colleges offer study abroad programs. Take advantage of this and visit a country you have always wanted to visit.Check with your advisor about what programs are available.
These trips can be expensive; make sure you can afford the means to go.
Some study abroad trips can fulfill credits for a specific major. Talk to your academic advisor about this option.

 You could also go somewhere with a lot of birds, or somewhere that has aÂ lot of natural features to notice, such as flowers, a river, or a view.;
, Sit down on the fresh, lush green and clean grass. Grass is an overlooked part of nature.
 You cannot hear the peaceful sounds of nature if you are being loud yourself.
 One of the best places to go in nature is somewhere with trees, because you can hear the soft, quiet rustle of their lush green leaves. Other sounds that you might hear include the birds, animals and the rustling of a brook. Try to pick out the different sounds without actually looking at first, then check to verify later. This will help you use more than just your visual sense.
 Watch fish in the river and birds flying in the air. Look at the trees' leaves bending over in a swooping bow as the wind brings it downwards, and observe the white, fluffy clouds floating up high in the beautiful sky.
 Breathe the fresh, clean air that the trees helped to bring to the world. Smell the different scents surrounding you, from flowers and freshly mown grass, to the scent or grass moist after rain or the the smell of the ocean.
 Look at the different types of birds, flowers, animals, and trees. There is so much you can see and observe in nature. Try to see parts of nature that you've never noticed before, both small and large.
 Try not to daydream or drift off. Keep looking at the beautiful sights to notice nature.
 And remember, you can go outside and spend time with nature almost anytime you want!

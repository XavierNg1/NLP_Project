 Keeping enough extra fluids down is the most important during periods of diarrhea. Consuming lots of fluids will help your child keep up with the fluids they are losing during their bowel movements. A liquid only diet is recommended at the onset of moderate or severe diarrhea, with foods slowly being introduced back into their diet. Clear liquids are the most helpful. However, plain water does not replace lost minerals. Try to supplement liquids with an oral rehydration solution (ORS) to replenish lost minerals and electrolytes.If keeping liquids down is difficult encourage them to take small sips or suck on ice chips frequently to avoid dehydration.
Avoid refined sugars and juices. Avoid giving your child fruit juices, sodas, or sweetened sports drinks, as they are known to loosen stool.
 Feeding your child small and bland meals frequently will help them avoid any irritation from overeating as well as help soothe their stomachs. Feed your child about six small meals a day as opposed to three larger meals to keep a nutrient rich intake consistent.Try nutrient rich foods like bananas, sliced apples, pasta, white rice, or cooked vegetables.
Do not withhold food from your child. The higher and more frequent their nutrient rich diet, the shorter their symptoms will last.Avoid foods high in fat. Foods like cheese, cream, and even full-fat yogurt can cause bloating and increase pain and discomfort while a child has diarrhea.
 After 24 hours your child will begin to benefit from ORSs and probiotic supplements. ORSs replace lost electrolytes while probiotics replace many helpful bacteria, as well as help combat harmful diarrhea causing bacteria, in your child’s GI tract.Yogurt is the most common and widely available probiotic, but it’s high fat content might cause discomfort. Check your local health food store or pharmacy for alternative probiotic supplements, choose low-fat yogurt options with live active cultures, or ask your doctor for advice.

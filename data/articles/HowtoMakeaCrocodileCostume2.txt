You could even pick one up at a thrift store and use it after a thorough wash., You’ll need quite a bit of green felt. Cut and drape the felt around the hat. You can attach the felt by using a hot glue gun. This will act as the base for the crocodile head.


If you’re going for a brown crocodile, use brown felt.
Don’t leave any gaps or open spaces on the hat., You could cut jagged tooth shapes from paper or use foam. Hunt around for old pieces of white foam that come from recent electronics purchase. Cut material into the shape of teeth. Use a hot glue gun to attach the teeth around the brim of the cap., Along with making crocodile eyes, you can also create spikes on the back the cap for extra detail. Cut a piece of white felt into two circles or semicircles. The semicircles are good for creating a aggravated or scarier crocodile. Color in the pupils using a black or yellow marker.


For the spikes you can fashion small felt funnels. Use different colors like light green and tan. Attach them to the back of the hat using a hot glue gun.

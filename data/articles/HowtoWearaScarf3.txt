 Lay your scarf out flat and wrap it around your shoulders, almost like a blanket. You can choose to tie the tail ends together in the front, or to loop them under your armpits and tie them together at your back. This style is perfect for a night out over a nice dress, to keep from getting chilly.
 If you have an oversized shirt or dress, belt it at your waist to make you look thinner by using a long scarf. Wrap the scarf around your waist and tie the ends together in a basic knot. You can choose to let the ends hang down loose, or you can twist the ends and tuck them into the belt.
 Create a cute bow on any handbag with a small, thin-fabric scarf. Wrap the scarf around a single handle near the base of the purse, and tie it into a bow. Adjust the fabric a bit so that the bow is visible from the front of the purse.
 If you have a very large scarf, lay it out flat and wrap it around your waist. Tie the ends together in the sarong-style at your waist, or pin the overlapping fabric together for a more professional look.

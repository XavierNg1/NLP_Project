 Most cakes are fairly solid and strong, so the cake itself will be fine provided it's well packed and not able to slide about on its journey.;
, Avoid anything too large, as the cake might slight and hit the sides. By the same token, don't squish the cake in unless you don't mind the frosting rubbing off.

 Bring along icing/frosting tubes, additional decorative elements and anything else needed to effect good touch-ups.


This kit could contain such items as a royal icing bag, extra sugar paste, extra decorations such as additional fondant figurines, etc.
 This is a great job to assign to your kids who are old enough to be responsible. Have them sit in the backseat with the cake alongside them. They can keep an eye out for sliding, bumps and any hairy corners.


If the cake is extra large, it's helpful to have another pair of hands to help you carry it safely.
 You might think it's a great idea to toss a cake into the car refrigerator but cakes need to remain at room temperature and in as dry conditions as possible. By all means put on the air conditioner if you, your occupants and the cake are melting but mostly try to keep the air temperature even.

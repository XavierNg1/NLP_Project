 The kazoo should be held between the lips (not held using the teeth or with the tongue wrapped around it). Blow into it so that they know how it sounds.
 Let them play around with it. Encourage them to go upstairs or outside if it starts bothering you (or, turn on some white noise).
 These may work better for older children, or for your own peace of mind. Recorders may capture a child's interest for longer, because they can learn to play songs.

 The witch hazel will act as a preservative. It will also help dilute the essential oils and allow them to blend with the water.If you don't have any witch hazel, you can use vodka instead.Avoid using rubbing alcohol however, as it is too harsh on the skin.

Make sure that the spray bottle is able to hold at least 2 ounces (60 milliliters).
Insert a funnel into the neck of the bottle to make filling it easier.
 You can use just one fragrance, or a combination of different ones. For example, if you wanted a classic, citrus fragrance, you could try: 10 drops grapefruit essential oil, 4 drops lime essential oil, and 4 drops lemon essential oil.Here are some more ideas to get you started:For something sweet, try 1/8 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and 10 drops wild orange essential oil.
For something energizing, try a combination of grapefruit and lavender essential oil.
For a Fall-like fragrance, start with a base of sweet orange essential oil, then add a few drops of cinnamon leaf essential oil.
For something refreshing, start with a base of lemon essential oil, then add a few drops of lavender and sandalwood essential oil., If you want to, you can add in 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of vegetable glycerin. This is not absolutely necessary, but it will help keep the fragrance last longer., If you don't have any distilled water, try filtered water or bottled water. Avoid using tap water, as it may contain minerals that could interfere with the final spray.For a more citrus-y fragrance, consider using orange blossom water instead; note that it is not the same thing as orange juice., Close the spray bottle tightly, then give it a shake. You can use it just like you would any other body spray, but using it on any areas that will be exposed to the sun; citrus makes the skin more sensitive to sunlight, which can increase chances of sunburn.You will need to shake the bottle each time before you use it.

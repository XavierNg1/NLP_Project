 You could start on the left and move to the right, or the other way around, but always start at the top of the wall and move to the bottom. This will ensure that the dust from the upper area of the wall will not fall down to cover an area you already cleaned., If youâ€™re dusting a wall that has wallpaper on it, move along the direction of the seams. Typically, this will also mean moving along an up-down axis. But if the wallpaper seams run horizontally across the wall, move the mop along the wall from side to side.

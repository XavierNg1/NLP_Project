, Will it be in the woods, a cave(provided there is a cave in your area of course) or a tree house? It all depends on your team's preferences.
 If your fort is inside, don't worry about the sticks and branches.
 If you want it to be permanent, then use a hammer and nails. If not, then don't. Just remember that you might have to relocate at a moments notice!

Build a door and a couple of windows. Once the basic structure is assembled and complete, spray paint it camouflage so it will not be noticed.

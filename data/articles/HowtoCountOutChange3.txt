 You should always count out the change you receive after every purchase to ensure that you have been given the correct amount. It is easy for cashiers to make a mistake (i.e. mistaking a $20 bill for a $10 bill) resulting in less change than you are owed. In order to make sure that you are given the proper amount of change, you should always look over the change and make sure it matches the amount you paid.


Count up from the price to the amount paid to determine the correct amount you are owed in change. For example, if an item cost $2.75 and you gave $5.00, you should count out the change starting with $2.75. Count out 1 quarter to make $3.00, and then $2.00 to get to $5.00. The total change, therefore, should be $2.25.
Use the calculator on your phone if you are in a rush or do not feel comfortable performing mental math.
 Depending on where you live, you may notice that you have received a few coins in a different currency. You should always make sure that the currency you receive as change is the same as the currency you initially paid with.


For example, in Canada you will often receive U.S. coins as change. Although at times Canadian and U.S. currency will be at par, it is often slightly different. You should get in the habit of checking to ensure you receive the proper currency.
 A simple way to think about receiving change is to realize that the you should leave with the same amount as you gave, but some should be in the form of change and the rest should be in the product or service that you purchased. For example, if you bought a doll that cost $25 and you gave $40, you would exit the store with $15 worth of change and $25 worth of doll. When added together, that equals $40, the total amount you originally paid.

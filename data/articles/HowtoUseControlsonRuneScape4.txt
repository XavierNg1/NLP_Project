 When you get there, right-click on any of the booths there. The bank screen will appear. Now you can choose to deposit and withdraw items.
 Select the number you wish to deposit. Any of the items you have deposited will be on the bank screen. If you have more than one of the item, the number will appear next to it.
 You can simply withdraw the item. If it is a trade able item that does not stack in your inventory, such as ore or food, you can withdraw it as a "Note." The advantage of this is that the item won't take up a lot of space in your inventory, but you can still sell it or trade it. For the most part, though, you can't use or wield an item that has been drawn as a note.
 There are there yo help organize your screen. If you choose Swap, just drag and drop an item on your Bank Screen on top of another item; they will swap positions. Choose Insert to drag and drop an item into a new place; the items will shuffle positions to make room for it.

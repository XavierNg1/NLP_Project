 Use your search engine to find medical air transport in your area or region. For best results, search for your city and state and the words, “air ambulance service.”;
, Many air transport companies provide emergency transport to nearby medical facilities, but you may need a different type of service. Find out if the company can accommodate any of the following, in addition to emergency situations:


Transportation for someone who is unable to travel on a commercial airline; there may be no pressing medical need, but the patient simply may not be physically up to the rigors of commercial airline travel.
In-flight services that provide medical requirements during transport; will the patient need specific attention such as IV fluids, oxygen or any specialty monitoring?
Repatriation services. This is a service that connects patients with their families in the patient’s home country while providing medical monitoring during the entire trip.
 An air ambulance service should be able to provide:


Assistance and transport for anyone, from infants to senior citizens.
All required life support medical equipment and required medications.
Medically trained personnel that will attend the patient from the hospital bedside all the way to the destination facility’s bedside.
 Determine if there are hidden costs, such as ground transportation of the patient to and from the hospitals and the aircraft.
 Some policies pay a token amount for air transport, even if medical necessity is established. Medicaid will sometimes cover the cost of an air ambulance. Medicare, however, usually doesn’t cover the cost of air medical transport services.

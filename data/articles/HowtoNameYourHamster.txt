 If it comes to you multiple times for the treat, wash your hands and try it without a treat. If your hamster likes his or her name it will come for the treat then eventually come without one. Some suggestions for male names can come with personalities such as munchkin, Caramel, Dash, Licorice, Spice, Cheddar or if he's really smart you can name it Einstein.

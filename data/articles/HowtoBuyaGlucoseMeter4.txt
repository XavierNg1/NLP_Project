 Your healthcare provider should be able to write a prescription for you to get a glucose meter, lancing device, and test strips. This should enable you to use your insurance, and can greatly decrease the price of your supplies. Ask your doctor for a prescription for these items if they do not write one for you automatically.
 Call your health insurance company to ask what models of glucose meter they will cover. Some insurance companies may only cover specific brands, and you definitely want to use your insurance to help cover costs every month., There are many different brands and models on the market today. Some of the private branded models offered by chain pharmacies have a very low price tag, and name brand meters can sometimes be purchased on sale.


Determine what type of other supplies come with the meter as part of a starter kit, such as a few lancets and possibly a small number of test strips.
 A common ploy by manufacturers is to offer a particular brand of meter for a sale price to attract buyers, but they fail to tell you that the test strips required for use with the meter may be very expensive.Look beyond the initial purchase and get some idea of how much you will pay for supplies in the future.


When making your selection, it might help to make a spreadsheet of the costs of the meter, strips, and lancets. See what each brand will cost for one month of use. Multiple by 12 to see what each brand will cost to use for a year. Even multiply that by 5 for a 5-year estimate. You might find that one brand becomes a better financial choice over time.
 It is often possible to purchase strips at online retail sites to save money. When using this approach, always check for the expiration date on the strips and determine if you can reasonably use all those strips before that date. You can also try to save money by getting supplies through your health insurance or using a pharmaceutical assistance program.

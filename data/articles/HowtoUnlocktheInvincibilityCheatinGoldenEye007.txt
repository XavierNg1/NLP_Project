 Dr. Doak is in one of 3 locations of this section: Either standing outside the doors, or either in one of the two doors. He is holding a clipboard in his hand and if you found him, you will receive a formal introduction. Once he walks over to you and receive the introduction, run to the door with the bottling room as fast you can.

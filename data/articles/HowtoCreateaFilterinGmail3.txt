 In order to automatically forward any messages, you will need to have a forwarding address associated with your Gmail account. Click the Gear icon in the upper-right corner, and then click Settings. Click the "Forwarding and POP/IMAP" tab.


Click the Add a forwarding address button and then enter in the address you want to forward to. Gmail will send a verification message to the address you enter, and then it will be available to select.
 If you have multiple email addresses, or often find yourself forwarding messages to others, you can set up filters to automate the forwarding process. This can be especially useful if you want to use your Gmail account as a "catch-all" email address and then forward the important messages to your real email account.


You can create a filter by clicking the Gear icon, selecting Settings, clicking the Filters tab, and then clicking the "Create new filter" link at the bottom of the page.
 You can specify addresses, subject lines, keywords and more. Any message that meets these criteria will be forwarded to the address you set in the next step.


Click "Create filter with this search" when you are finished setting your criteria.
 Check the "Forward it" box, and then select your forwarding address from the drop-down menu. All of the messages that meet the filter criteria will be sent to this address.


You can choose to delete the messages from your Gmail account after they are forwarded by checking the "Delete it" box.
 Your new forwarding filter will be created, and any future messages that meet your filter criteria will be forwarded to the address you specified.


Unlike other filter options, you cannot retroactively apply this filter to existing messages. Only future messages will be forwarded to the address you set.

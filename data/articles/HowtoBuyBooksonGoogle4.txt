 One quick way to find books for purchase is to simply use the basic Google search engine. Start by searching for your book's title (or relevant keywords) on Google.com.


The results you'll see on the next page will usually be for websites, not books. Don't worry â€” this is normal.
 Above your search results, you'll see a few different options for filtering the items below. Usually, these will include "Images", "Videos", "Shopping", and a few more. Click "Books".


If you don't see "Books", click "More" and then click "Books" in the menu that drops down.
 You will now be looking at a list of book results that match your search terms. This screen will be more or less the same as if you had used the "Print Books" options above.


From here, you can click the book you're looking for, then use the options on the left side of the screen to purchase or download it. As a reminder, you can use the orange button in the top left to get the ebook version of the book or the "Get this book in print" link to find the print version for sale online.

 Use your creativity here, but make sure you have all the necessary information:



What is the club? This is where you detail the purpose and theme of the club, along with some of the activities you have in mind (sharing stories, debating topics, going on trips and others).

Where and when will the club meet? Make sure you choose a time that is as user-friendly as possible, and work under the assumption that most of your prospective club members are only available at certain times during the week.

How much does it cost? Unless you plan on creating a fund or collection for future excursions, it doesn't make much sense to charge for entry. Simply invite others to bring snacks or drinks, and everything you need should be covered.

What is the club founderâ€™s contact information? Be sure to include an email address and telephone number, since some people prefer one mode of communication over the other.
 Tell your friends. Tell your family. Tell everyone else you keep in touch with on a regular basis. Even if they aren't interested, they may know others who will be. Word-of-mouth notice has never been easier to achieve, thanks in large part to the growing presence of social media.
 For many hobbies, message boards help to bring together those with similar interests for discussions and story-sharing. In essence, being an active member of a fishing-themed message board is almost like being in a club. Making the transition to an actual club simple and smooth.

 It's a green app that contains a white speech bubble.
 Select one with a person who you'd like to add to your contacts.


If Messages opens to a conversation, tap the Back (<) link in the top-left corner to see a list of all your conversations.
 It's in the top-right corner of the screen.
 You'll see it at the top of the screen.


If there are multiple numbers in the conversation you opened, tap the number you wish to add to your contacts.
 This option is near the bottom of the screen.
 Use the "First name," "Last name," and "Company" fields to name the contact in a meaningful way that you will be able to call up at a later time.
 Use the labeled fields to add other contact information such as email address, birthday, mailing address, and social media accounts.
 It's in the top-right corner of the screen. Now you've saved the information to your iPhone's Contacts.

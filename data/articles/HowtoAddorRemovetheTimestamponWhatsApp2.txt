 It's the green app with a white phone icon on a green and white chat bubble.


If this is your first time opening WhatsApp, you'll need to set up WhatsApp.
 This button is in the top-right corner of the screen.


If WhatsApp opens to a conversation, tap the back button in the top-left corner of the screen first.
 It's at the bottom of the drop-down menu here.
 It's near the top of the page.
 This option is at the top of the "Account" page.
 It's at the top of the "Privacy" page. There are three options here:



Everyone - Anyone who has your contact information can see the last time you were online (default).

My contacts - Only people in your contacts list can see the last time you were online.

Nobody - No one will be able to see the last time you were online. This setting also prevents you from seeing when other users were last online.
 Doing so will enable or disable timestamps based on your preference.


If you're enabling timestamps, you'll be able to view them beneath a contact's name at the top of a WhatsApp conversation.

 The best race for a thief character is Khajiit, but take time to look at the other races as well. Each one comes with their own perks - Argonians can breathe underwater, which comes in handy when travelling around Tamriel.;
, It will give your character a great speed boost, which will come in useful if your character has to quickly sneak away from a crime scene.
, The easiest way to do this is to commit a crime and be sent to jail - if you intend to join the Dark Brotherhood a murder is probably the best choice, as it will give you the opportunity to join both factions in one. Shortly after serving your sentence you'll be approached and given a message. Follow the instructions to the Garden of Dareloth, and before you know it you'll be a member of the Thieves Guild (for further information on this quest and others try 'www.uesp.net'.)

, So, step number five is to go to the Arena in the Imperial City. Speak with Owyn to join up. Work your way through at your own pace - you can leave to do other quests in the meantime, so don't forget to upgrade your weapons and armour when you can afford it.
 It's easy to sneak into the Garden of Dareloth at midnight from outside of the Imperial City, then all you need to do is pay Armand Christophe half of your bounty. If you don't have the gold though, you'll need to go adventuring for it in mines, ruins and camps. That's where the armour and weapons come in - you do not want to be stuck in a mine with a goblin skirmisher with only a shirt and pants plus no weapon to defend yourself with.

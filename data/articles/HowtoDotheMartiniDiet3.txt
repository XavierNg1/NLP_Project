 Rule Number 3 of the Martini Diet is to “eat the very best only at mealtimes.” This means that you'll need to avoid snacking between meals as a way of conserving calories. At first this may seem like a challenge but seriously think about the times you snack––many of those times are likely to be driven by boredom, stress or pressure, or just because the item happens to be in your view. Retraining yourself to eat only at mealtimes is a great way to rein in the calorie intake.
 Only eat at those times. It's also a good idea to turn this into a meal with others, so that you have time to exchange talk and enjoy their company.
 For instance, do not carry bottles of soda or cups of coffee with you as you do errands. However, you can carry a water bottle with you––water helps to reduce food cravings and helps you to feel full.
 Avoid eating in your car or while you're on the go. Any place that isn't made specifically for eating should be out of bounds––and sorry, that includes the couch! Making this a firm rule will help to prevent the ingestion of extra food that you're not often conscious of nibbling on.

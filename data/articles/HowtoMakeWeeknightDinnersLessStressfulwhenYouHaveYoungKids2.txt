 Planning a menu for the week will help to save time and allow you to shop for ingredients ahead of time. Have your children give their input by asking them for three meal ideas, and slotting in at least one of their ideas during the week (e.g. tacos on Tuesday as suggested by one child, and spaghetti on Thursday for another). Make meals fun by having theme nights (e.g. "Pizza Party Friday")., To optimize your time and still make savory, well-balanced meals for your family, use a slow cooker to prepare dinner. Meals often cook in the machine for between four to ten hours, depending on the type of food and heat setting selected. As a general rule, foods that cook between 8-10 hours are more flavorful and tender as a result of the slow warm up period. Try recipes like:


Pork chops
Fried chicken
Chicken tacos
Pulled pork

, To make the most of your money and save time on food preparation, use leftovers to make creative meals. Be sure to use leftovers within a few days and throw out any food that you suspect might be spoiled. Some interesting meals to make with leftovers might include:


Fried rice
Ham and vegetable soup
Turkey and stuffing casserole
Baked macaroni and cheese

Rub your lips with either lip salve or a small dot of facial scrub.
Gently brush the lips with a soft toothbrush. This will lift off any pieces of dry or dead skin and will leave the lips feeling soft and smooth.;
, Use your usual color, straight from the tube.


Do not use lip liner, as gloss looks better on undefined lip lines.
 Use your fingertips to apply it to your lips.
 High-shine lips become the facial focal point, so don't have other focal points competing with this. Equally, don't overdo the gloss.

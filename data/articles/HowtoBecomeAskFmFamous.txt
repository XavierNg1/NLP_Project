 Your profile has to be interesting if you want to be become famous. Post real pictures of yourself; people don't want fakes.;
, Follow active users with around 5k likes or more, to make your "stream" as interesting as possible. Do not follow users who haven't answered any questions or users with a foreign language that you don't understand yourself.
 Some of the things you might like to tell other users include: "you look good" or "cool shirt". Say compliments that will attract other people to your account.
 Be nice, courteous and considerate when asking questions. You could ask something like "Hi, I'm new here, can you please check my page and like some of my answer?". Accept that some people will reject you––that's part of the game.


Don't ask yourself questions, not even anonymously.
Avoid the random questions that come from Ask.fm.
 Try to make your responses funny, interesting or even emotionally charged.
 You can auto like your answers in a legal way by creating a few other accounts and using them to like your own answers. Ask.fm limits every account to 100 likes a day, so if you have four other accounts, you can get 2800 likes a week. But keep in mind that this step won't help you to get famous; it will only increase your likes. It is only added here to be helpful for new users.

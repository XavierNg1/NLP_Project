Slim laptops may not have an Ethernet port, in which case you'll need to either use a USB Ethernet adapter or connect wirelessly if your router allows it.
 Make sure you're using an Ethernet cable (RJ45), not a telephone cable (RJ11).
 This can be any open LAN port on either the router or the switch, depending on your LAN setup.
 If you're using a router, your work is complete. Once all of the computers are connected to a LAN port, they will be assigned IPs automatically and will appear on the network. If you set up your LAN for gaming, you should be able to start your LAN game and have each computer connect.


If you're using a switch and no router, you'll still need to assign IP addresses to each computer.
 You won't be able to access resources on a networked computer until file and printer sharing is enabled. You can select specific files, folders, and drives to share on each computer, as well as share access to printers.

 Make it look like a bowl., You will be working with one of these for now. You will need a knife and sugar for this., Don't cut the outside; it's your bowl!, Sprinkle the sugar in between every little slit you see. This will soak into the sugar and enhance the rich flavor.

You can add as much sugar as you want but don't overdo it. Put about an equal amount for each little slit. You can do a teaspoon for each slit or even a tablespoon.
Maple sugar is especially delicious.
 Use a spoon to scoop up both flesh and sugar.

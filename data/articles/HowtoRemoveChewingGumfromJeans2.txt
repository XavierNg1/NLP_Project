 Fill a bowl with white distilled vinegar. You shouldn't need more than 1 1/2 - 2 cups of vinegar. Place the bowl in the microwave and heat for about 45 seconds. If you don't have access to a microwave, heat on a stove in a small saucepan.Don't overheat the vinegar on the stove. Only heat for about two minutes.
 Use a standard cleaning cloth. Don't use a dirty cloth, and don't use a cloth that you're worried about getting stained. Let it soak for about a minute.
 Rub the cloth on the gum. Saturate the gum with your vinegar soaked cloth. Leave the cloth on the stain for a few minutes. The vinegar will dissolve the gum and cause it to ball up.
 Use a toothbrush with hard bristles and carefully brush the chewing gum off. Again, don't use your everyday toothbrush!

, Throw the jeans in with your next load of laundry. Only do this if the gum is fully removed. Pieces of gum could stick to other clothes, if you haven't fully removed it.

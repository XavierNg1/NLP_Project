 Before adding the water, mix the teaspoon of vanilla into it to ensure the flavor distributes evenly. Then cook the recipe like normal.
 This recipe adds a little tang and promotes a greater bubbling, leading to bigger, broader honeycombs. To make it, simply add 1 teaspoon white vinegar and a pinch (under 1/2 a teaspoon) cream of tartar along with the sugars, then cook like normal., This will make a slightly richer, salty-sweet treat that is nearly impossible to resist. To make it, all you have to do is substitute pure maple syrup for the honey -- no other changes needed. While cooling, sprinkle the tops with sea salt for a light garnish.This recipe is great when served with melted semi-sweet chocolate, as well.
 Once the honeycomb has cooled, set a shallow pan of water on high heat. Dump a bag of your favorite chocolate into a smaller sauce pot and cook the chocolate in the hot water bath, stirring until smooth. As soon as it is hot and liquidy, dip half of each honeycomb chunk into the chocolate for a decadent treat.


Feel free to use whatever type of chocolate -- milk, dark, semi-sweet, etc. -- you'd like. They all go well with honeycomb.
This is the easiest way to make honeycomb-based candy bars like Violent Crumbles or Crunchies.,

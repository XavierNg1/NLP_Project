 Remember to plant an apple tree in a reasonable spot that's not in the middle of the yard (in case it actually grows).
 Spread some sand outside (you can find it at a pond, or you might be able to buy it) and add a Kiddie-Pool with umbrellas.


If you put a large amount of umbrellas up, your beach might be able to withstand rain. (Don't think you can leave this out during winter, unless you want to do some Kiddie-Ice-Skating.)

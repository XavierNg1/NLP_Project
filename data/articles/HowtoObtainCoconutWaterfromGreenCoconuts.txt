 The coconut trees should be twenty feet or less to gain access to green coconuts, preferably still on the tree. You may get lucky and find some wind fallen nuts.;
, If there is none available, you can use a fallen palm frond.
 Tie one end of the bootlace at one end of the branch or palm frond. Tie the other end about a foot or so further back on the branch, so that there is a hanging loop.
 Slide the loop under the coconut, pushing the loop over the coconut from the bottom up, bring the loop up past the top of the coconut.
 Pull down on the stick to retrieve coconut.


The inside shell containing the coconut water is very soft. Great care must be used in opening the young coconut. The tops of green coconuts can easily be cut off with a serrated knife, or you can find a large rock with a sharp point and using that point carefully peel off the husk.
 This is highly nutritious and delicious. Coconut water is so safe, pure and free of chemicals that babies and pregnant women can drink it.Water permeates through the husk and is naturally filtered.

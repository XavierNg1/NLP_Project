 If you still have the app you want to unlink installed on your device, open it.
 Usually, all links and configurations for the app can be set one way or another through its settings.
 Find the option to unlink Dropbox from the app and tap on it. Confirm if asked.
 In the worst case that you can’t figure out how to unlink Dropbox from the app using its settings, you can just delete or uninstall the app directly. With the app gone, it cannot access your Dropbox data anymore.
 Repeat steps 1 to 4 until you’ve removed all unnecessary apps that had linked to your Dropbox account.

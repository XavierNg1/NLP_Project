 Because your baby is getting larger, your uterus starts to expand even more, causing pressure to be put on your diaphragm. This pressure can make you feel like you can’t catch your breath. You may find that you experience this more severely at night than during the day.


One way to relieve shortness of breath is to sit upright so that the weight of the uterus will be distributed away from the diaphragm. Add two or more pillows to support your head and neck when sleeping to relieve dyspnea.
 Your expanding uterus may put even more pressure on your veins, which can lead to the formation of hemorrhoids in your rectum. Luckily, these can be managed.


Rest in Sim’s position, which is when you lie on your back with both legs raise up against a wall or chair.
Talk to your doctor about taking stool softeners.
Try to reduce any constipation you are experiencing, as described in Part 1.
 During this stage of the pregnancy, you may feel Braxton Hicks contractions. Braxton Hicks contractions occur when your uterus starts to contract and relax periodically. You will most likely only feel minimal pain because of these contractions. The pain can be likened to that of menstrual cramps. This is one sign that labor is fast approaching.


Inform your obstetrician right away if you feel these contractions. Monitor the duration and severity of contractions as they occur.

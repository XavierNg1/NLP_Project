 If it is too late to do this, and there is a rider coming in, avoid the rider. Count on getting splashed if between the rider and the shoulder and count on getting a little smashed, by the wave, if between the rider and the broken wave - 1) slip off the board to avoid the incoming rider or 2) do an Eskimo roll to go through the wave.;
,, For all but the large waves, an Eskimo roll is OK. A board that is turned upside down offers less resistance. Even while grasping the board continue making progress, to the outside, by flutter kicking. The flutter kicking may be the difference between punching through the wave and going over the falls.
, Without the board hope that the leash holds. Diving for the bottom with the board, hang on to the board as long as possible and then hope that the leash system holds. Here, a board surfer has the advantage over the bodyboarder in that, with the longer ankle leash, the board surfer can dive deeper and escape the main force of the wave. The force of a wave is more on the surface, still, the bodyboarder, even with his short leash, should make the effort to dive down and forward.
 Besides getting cut on the reef and sea urchins, the leash can get tangled in the coral - but this is nowhere a problem as it is for board surfers. Big waves break in deep water but the force of the big wave is so powerful, the fear of meeting up with the reef is there. Watch the tides when bodyboarding in areas with problem reefs.

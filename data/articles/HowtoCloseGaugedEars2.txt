 DO NOT put antiseptic in your ears, because this will cause them to dry out and sting like hell. Instead, clean your ear pieces with a saltwater soak, and soak a cotton ball in the saltwater solution and hold it up to your ear holes.
 Use oils like Jojoba oil or Vitamin E oil. These oils will help repair the scar tissue caused by stretching your ears and will speed up the healing process., This will help the skin become softer and make blood flow to the area. Moisturizing after showering also helps get rid of dead skin, allowing the holes to heal without irritation or infection.

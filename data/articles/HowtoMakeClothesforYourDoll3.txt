 Measure both length and width of the doll's body. Write down the measurements.
 Draw it to the measurements and keep it very simple. Most importantly, it should be at least 1 inch/2.5cm bigger than the measurements, to allow room for moving and joining. You need a front and a back for the complete outfit.


You can even make newspaper or recycled gift wrap clothes. It really depends on what you want. Just note that newspaper print can rub off on dolls, which might spoil the doll.
 Glue or staple them together along the edges, leaving the head hole, arm holes and base of the shirt or dress open; or the leg holes and torso hole open for pants.


It is often easier with paper clothes to attach the pieces while on the doll. It's only paper and you can rip it off when you're finished with and start a new one later. It depends how careful you want to be.
If you want to reuse the paper dress or top, consider making tabs that open along one side; these tabs should open to allow you to remove the clothing with ease.
 Glitter glue, paint, pencils, etc. are ideal for jazzing up the clothing.
 Experiment with different kinds of paper and different ways of producing the paper clothing; there are some good ideas in Japanese origami books for paper clothing that you might like to explore further.

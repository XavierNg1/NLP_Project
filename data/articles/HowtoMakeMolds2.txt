For a 1-part mold, secure the flat face of the object to the floor section of the mold box using an easy-release adhesive compound. This prevents any of your moldmaking compounds from leaking.

You may want to stay away from Insta-Mold and stick to modeling clay.


For a 2-part mold, layer the bottom of the mold box with clay and push the object into the clay, leaving 1/2 of its height exposed for molding. Once you feel you have submerged the lower portion of your object to its approximate half-mark, smooth the top surface of the clay as much as possible before moving on to the next step to make a mold.
 There are a number of varieties out there, so it's advised to do your research before you purchase anything.

Latex moldmaking compounds are cheap and simple, but they take a long, long time to set.
Silicone RTV moldmaking rubber is a solid bet, regardless of your project.
Reusable molding material is not for high temperature casting, but can be remelted.
 Paint a thin layer of the rubber compound on its face right before pouring. Be sure to pay close attention to any crevices or small surface details. This initial thin layer should take care of the details, but still be diligent.

 You can also move daffodil offsets to a container. Try to choose a deep pot to give their roots plenty of room (at least 8 inches). The pot should have drainage holes.
 Bulb compost or regular potting compost will work well for daffodils in pots. Fill the pot so that it is about two-thirds full, and plant the bulbs pointed end upwards. The bulbs should be close but not touching. Cover the bulbs with soil and water the pot.
 Move the container to a cool dark spot such as a shed or cellar for a few months rather than bringing it into a warm home. Continue to water it and bring it out into a warmer, lighter place after about three months.


It’s best not to put containers of daffodils in a warm location as this inhibits flowering.
 After flowering, top dress your container with a fertilizer such as bone meal (this is pretty stinky so you may not want to keep it in the house!).
 Daffodils should survive three years in a container but won’t be as good after the first year. For best results, plant the spent bulbs outside after the foliage dies back and replant your container with fresh bulbs for the following flowering season.
 Indoor planted daffodils and those previously planted in containers can be moved to the outside for planting in the ground. The best time to do this is after they flower and when the foliage has died back. This will typically be in the late summer or early autumn.


Follow the steps outlined in Method 1 to transplant your daffodil bulbs.

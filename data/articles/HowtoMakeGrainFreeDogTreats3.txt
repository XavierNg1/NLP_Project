 All of these ingredients should be available at your local natural food grocery store. You will need:1 ½ cups of almond flour
3 - 4 tablespoons of coconut flour
1 tablespoon of coconut oil
2 Free range eggs
½ cup dried cranberries.
 Preheat to oven to 325F. You will need two bowls and a mixing spoon to mix the dough. You will also need to use a silicone mat or parchment paper and place it into a flat cookie sheet. You may need to cut the parchment paper to size, so that it sits flat inside the edges of the cookie sheet.


You may want to pull out some cute cookie cutters to cut your treats out. This, however, is not a requirement, as you can simply cut them with a knife.
 Beat the 2 eggs and set aside. Combine the almond flour, dried cranberries, and coconut oil in a bowl. Pour the eggs into the dry mixture and mix to form a wet dough.


Add the coconut flour a spoonful at a time, mixing well in between. Combine 3 - 4 tbsp of coconut flour until the dough is easy to roll but not overly sticky so that you can form it into a ball.
 Roll the dough out to your desired thickness, between 1/4 inch to 3/4 inch. If the dough is too sticky, try sprinkling some additional coconut flour on top of it while rolling it out. Then cut into squares or use cookie cutters to cut to the desired shape.
 Place the treats on your prepared baking sheet. Bake in the oven for 15 - 18 minutes. The treats should become lightly golden brown when fully cooked.


Cool before serving.
 Remember treats are just that, a treat. Be sure to give your dog a healthy balanced diet and incorporate treats only when it has been especially good or you are doing important training.

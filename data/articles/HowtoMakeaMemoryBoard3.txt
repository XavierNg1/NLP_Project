 For this project, you may use any size frame you like. Flip the frame over and carefully take off the back. Take out everything from the frame except the glass., If your frame comes with a backing that fills the entire frame, you may skip this step. If not, you can create your own insert out of cardboard. Measure, mark, and cut a piece of cardboard that will fill the entire picture frame. You will cover this insert (or the original backing) with fabric or wrapping paper., If you are using fabric, run a warm iron over the material. This will remove any wrinkles and creases. Cut a piece of fabric or wrapping paper so that each side is 2 inches (5.08 cm) longer than the corresponding dimensions of the backing., Place the fabric or wrapping paper wrong side up on a flat surface. Position the cardboard insert or original backing in the center. Fold the extra material over the insert/backing and attach it to the back with tape., Place the backing/insert in the frame and close the frame. Hang your memo board on a wall or place it on the table. Write your first memo with a dry erase marker.

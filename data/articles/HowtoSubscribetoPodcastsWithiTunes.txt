 If you don't already have iTunes, just log on to www.apple.com and click on "iTunes". You will pretty much be set from there.;
, Along the top screen, there should be a menu with words like "Music", "Movies", and such. You need to click on the one that says "Podcast"

, Click on that and a drop down menu should appear listing all the categories they have.
 Click the "Subscribe for Free" button below the name and be finished. If that's what you want, then all you have to do next is wait for it to download into your iTunes library and that's it.
 If you still are not sure if you want this podcast, you can even listen to a sample of the episodes. After you're done, click the "Subscribe for Free" button below the podcast artwork and wait for it to download into your iTunes library.

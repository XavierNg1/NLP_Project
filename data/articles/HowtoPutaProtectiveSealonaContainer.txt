 It can be as fancy or as simple as you wish. Anything from a shoebox to a wooden chest will work fine. Clean it up, and, if you wish, decorate it.;
,, Draw them in such a way that their positions will match once the container is closed.
 This part is extremely personal. Make sure the seal is something meaningful to you and that you can easily remember and visualize it.
 This, again, is very personal. Write it out on a piece of paper or fabric using any medium you wish (ink, paint, etc). Next to the spell, draw another pentagram. (Note: the spell in the picture is blurred to prevent misuse and plagiarism. Remember, spells are always more powerful when you write them yourself!).
 Do this by signing in the bottom of the paper / fabric and then leaving an imprint of your fingerprints next to the spell, in the same medium in which the spell is written. Leave the fingerprints of the hand by which you wrote the spell. In the middle, draw a circle to represent Aether and bind the pact.
 Recite your spell and then put the paper / fabric on which it's written in your container.
 Organize them any way you want.
 Place your palms on the top of the lid and recite your spell again. Imagine your seal black and spinning deosil as you recite, and then descending on the container. The moment it settles on the lid, its color will change. Do not try to dictate this, let the change in color come by itself. It's alright if the color it changes to is unexpected, just go with it.
 This will add more power to it.

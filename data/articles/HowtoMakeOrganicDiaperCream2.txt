 The most basic diaper cream recipe contains only the three main ingredients:1/8 cup beeswax
2/3 cup coconut oil
¾ tablespoon zinc oxide powder

, This can be done in the microwave by putting the ingredients into a microwave-safe container and cooking on low in 30-second increments, stirring after each 30 second increment is up.


You can also use a double boiler on the stovetop by placing the ingredients in the top section and an inch or two of water in the bottom section. Let the water simmer at a low temperature, while stirring the ingredients together.
 Remove the coconut and beeswax mixture from the heat and mix zinc oxide powder into the mixture. Use a hand mixer or stick blender and blend for several minutes until the mixture doesn’t have any clumps.
 Small glass jars or metal tins work well for storing your diaper cream.


The cream will solidify as it cools, so let it cool for a few hours before using it on your baby.

 Do not grease the plate, and try to spread the almonds out evenly so that they overlap minimally. Place the plate into the microwave.
 Set the microwave to its highest power setting, and cook the sliced almonds for 1 minute.


After 1 minute, stir the almonds to redistribute them and ensure they toast evenly.
Continue cooking the almonds in 30 second intervals, stirring after each time.
 Aim to remove the almonds from the microwave just before they start to brown and become fragrant. This should take between 3 and 5 minutes, depending on your microwave's power.

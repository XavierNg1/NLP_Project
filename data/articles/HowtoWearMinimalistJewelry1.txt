 When it comes to minimalist jewelry, you don't want to get too fussy. However, you don't want to make it so simple that it's boring. The key is picking pieces that make a statement while still being minimal, such as single stone in a clean setting dangling off a necklace or set in a ring. A single pearl on slim silver band can be this type of statement piece., If jewels or small stones aren't your style, try geometric pieces. This style creates clean lines with startling shapes. They're bold without being fussy or overbearing. For instance, try wearing a geometric bracelet as a statement piece with almost any short-sleeved shirt or dress.Often, geometric pieces are composed of thin materials. For instance, you may find a bangle that outlines an arrow or square instead of filling it in.
 Most of the minimalist jewelry tends to stick to mainly metal and chains with a small accent. However, you can still have a beaded effect and pull off a minimalist look. The key is to keep the beads small and somewhat muted in color. It can help to minimize how many you wear, such as just having beads on the center part of a chain., A simple chain bracelet with a small accent piece is a great way to incorporate minimalist jewelry into your wardrobe. For instance, a bar bracelet is a classic option that can be personalized with an inscription. It adds glamour and elegance to a simple outfit., Simple studs with a touch of shine can be the perfect minimalist jewelry. For instance, gold studs with a tiny diamond in the middle add shine but keep your jewelry to a minimum. You can also choose something with a little more whimsy, such as tiny flowers or bows. A pair of small dangle earrings is also a good option.

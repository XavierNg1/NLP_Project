 This is a popular technique with car enthusiasts. Heat will cause the metal to expand. As the metal expands, the small dents will pop out. Using nature’s oven will take a long time if you aren’t in a very warm place.


The longer your vehicle is exposed to warm sunlight, the more likely this technique will work.;
, If you're unable to expose your vehicle to the heat of the sun, you can use a hair dryer. Hold the hair dryer 5 to 7 inches away from the dents for two minute intervals. Carefull not to touch the dryer directly on the car.If the vehicle's paint begins to discolor, stop applying heat immediately. Use wax or a rubbing compound to restore the paint’s color.
 The drastic change in temperature should cause the dents to pop out. Dry ice can damage your skin, so wear gloves when handling dry ice. Move the ice around the dented area to rapidly cool the area.


This technique can be a great solution, but sometimes there'll still be remnants of the dents after popping. Additional repairs may be required.

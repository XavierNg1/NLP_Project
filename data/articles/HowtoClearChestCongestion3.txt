 Although food doesn’t seem to be directly related to mucus and phlegm, there is a correlation between the two. Dairy products, salt, sugar, and fried foods all increase mucus production. Cut these items out of your diet until your chest has cleared. 

, On the flip side, there are certain foods that can help to clear out the mucus in your chest and lessen its production. Eat spicy foods, citrus fruits, garlic, and ginger for easy chest congestion relief. In particular, asparagus and pineapple have shown to have chest-clearing benefits as well.
 Both ingredients can help to clear congestion. Add soda crackers to the mix to help even more.Add juice from 3 lemons to a cup of very hot water.
Crush some garlic (1- 2). Add this to the water.
Add some salt and a lot of crushed black pepper.
Gulp it all down and you will instantly feel better.

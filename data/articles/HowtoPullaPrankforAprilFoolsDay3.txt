 You'll need a feather or duster, and some whipped cream. Already know it? Yep. When someone is sleeping, put the whipped cream on their hand. Tickle their nose. Splat! They just put whipping cream in their face. Shout out "APRIL FOOLS!"


If they don't wake up, go up close to them and shout "APRIL FOOLS!" anyway.

 If your style is subtle and serene, consider placing an electrical candle in each window of the house. Turn them on at night so that they can be seen from outside. This is a beautiful way to decorate for Christmas without spending too much money or going overboard with big decorations.
 Kids love to cut intricate snowflake patterns out of paper. Make them look even more festive by painting them with a layer of clear glue, then adding glitter. When they dry, tape them to the walls and windows using clear double-sided tape.
 Red and green are the colors of Christmas, so anything that has this color scheme will make your house look more festive. Get creative with red and green items you already have around the house, or involve your kids by asking them to help you color some red and green decorations to hang. Here are some ideas for using red and green to accent your home:


Exchange your normal throw pillows for red and green pillows during the holiday season.
Tie red or green bows around doorknobs around the house. You can attach little Christmas bells to them as well.
Use red and green dishcloths to make your kitchen look Christmassy.
Buy a poinsettia plant to add a natural red and green element to your home.
Set out red and green candles on your tables and bookshelves.

 Use scissors to cut a strip of any patterned washi tape. The strip of tape should be just a little longer than the length of the alligator clip.


Make sure that the tape is at least as wide as the width of the clip. You can still use washi tape that is wider than the clip, but you might have difficulty if the reverse is true.
 Carefully stick the piece of tape over the top of an alligator hair clip or other flat barrette.


Try to position the tape so that there is a little overhang beyond the front and back of the clip. Make sure that the entire width of the clip is covered, as well.
Run your thumb over the tape, applying even pressure, to help remove any air bubbles and flatten the tape.
 Use scissors to carefully trim away any excess tape along the width of the clip. Try to trim the tape as close to the clip as possible.


Do not worry about trimming away any excess tape from the lengthwise front and back of the clip.
If you cannot trim away the entire excess width, you can carefully press some of the width-wise edge onto the side of the clip. Make sure that the tape does not cover the teeth of the alligator clip, however.
 Carefully fold the excess tape hanging beyond the front and back over the edge and onto the back of the clip.


As you fold the tape, make sure that it doesn't stick to the teeth or the hinged portion of the clip.
Most alligator clips are rectangular, making it easy to fold the tape over the edge. If you end up using a hair clip with a round end, however, you will need to fold the tape more carefully. Fold the corners of the excess tape under as evenly as possible, then follow by folding the center of the excess tape in the same direction., The hair clip should now be done and ready to wear.

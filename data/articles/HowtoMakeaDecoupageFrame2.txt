 Trace the whole frame (including the window!) onto the back of wrapping paper or other patterned paper. Cut the paper out along your traced lines. You should have a reproduction of the outside of your frame made in wrapping paper.


You can also simply cut around your frame; however, this can look sloppy unless you have a very steady hand.
 If you are using thick wrapping paper, you can brush water on lightly. , Paint the glue in a thick, even layer on the frame. Then lay the paper on, starting from a corner and moving outward to prevent bubbles from appearing.


After your initial application of glue dries, seal the paper with another application of decoupage glue. Use a foam brush to avoid brush strokes, and let it dry.
 This is a good idea if you cover the entire picture frame with a pattern. Sanding the edges of the paper away shows off the wooden frame, and gets rid of any sharp edges or cut lines that make the frame look less professional.


Use a low-grit sandpaper. You won’t need to sand too much; you’re only sanding through paper and glue.

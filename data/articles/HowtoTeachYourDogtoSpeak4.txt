 Many dogs will make too much noise when visitors arrive. If your dog doesn’t bark, you might consider yourself lucky. On the other hand, you may want to teach her to bark for security reasons, or because you have a big house and can't hear people knock.
 Give the “speak” command as you knock. Reward your dog for barking., After several rounds of knocking and asking to “speak”, you want your dog to start barking at the knock alone. Reward your dog and give lavish praise if she barks. Practice this over several days to be sure your dog has it down.You can do the same training with the doorbell. Have a friend or family member outside to ring it for you.
 You may need to give the “speak” command the first couple of times. After that, drop the command and let the dog respond to the knocking.Again, you can do the same training with a doorbell.
 As instructed earlier, start by asking for the correct behavior multiple times before giving a treat. Then work in sessions with no treats.

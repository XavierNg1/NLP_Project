 Even though juices come from healthy fruits and vegetables, they still contain calories that can add up quickly. Even 100% apple juice and orange juice have higher calorie counts than an equal volume of regular cola per portion size.If your notion of healthy juices revolves around their calorie counts, select juices with low calorie counts like beet juice, grapefruit juice, or a mixed juice containing celery, cucumber, and kale.If you’re making juices at home, utilize recipes that don’t add sugar, or substitute a noncaloric sweetener in its stead.;
, Juices with added sugar are less healthy than those without. To choose healthy juices, only drink juices that are pure juice. These juices might be labeled as “100% juice.”Avoid juices labeled “made from concentrate,” as these have higher sugar levels.Check the label on store-bought juices to make sure that the “juice” you pick is actually juice — not “10% juice” or some other fraction, as is often the case.
 Nutrients – that is, vitamins and minerals – help keep your body healthy. If you believe that “healthy juices” refers to juices that are high in nutrients, stick to those made of watermelon, honeydew, citrus fruits, berries, guava, and papaya.Of the homemade juicers, centrifugal juicers are the least desirable, as the heat they produce might reduce the amount of enzymes in the resulting juice. Triturating juicers, while more expensive, are more efficient, and thus retain more nutrients.

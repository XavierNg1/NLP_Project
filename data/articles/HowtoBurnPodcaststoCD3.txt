 The best quality, easiest podcasts to burn will come with a download link. You can find 1000's of free podcasts for download online at iTunes, Podcast Alley, NPR, EarWolf, and elsewhere. Simply search for podcasts that interest you and look for the download link next to each episode.You must have downloaded the file for the podcast to burn it to a disc.Not all podcasts can be downloaded directly, but the vast majority are available for free.
 This method is only helpful if you can leave your computer on for long periods while the podcast records, but may be the only way to download the podcast and make it burnable. To do so:


Download a recording program, like Replay Audio, that can save the sound coming from your computer. This program automatically makes a new "song" from the playing podcast, allowing you to listen anytime.
Some Windows users can use the "Stereo Mix" to record whatever sound is playing on your computer currently. To do so, right-click on the volume icon on your toolbar, then click "Recording Devices." Right-click in the box and select both "Show Disabled" and "Show Disconnected." Enable your "Stereo Mix," then use any music recording program to record the podcast as you play it. Note: Not all windows computers can do this., Buy a basic 8mm cable (aux cord) and run it from your output (headphone jack) to input (microphone jack). You can then use a recording program, like Audacity or Garage Band, to record the podcast as it plays. Basically, it takes the sound that would go to your headphones and routes it into a microphone, re-recording the file to your computer.


Save the file, then place it on your desktop or in iTunes to view and burn later.

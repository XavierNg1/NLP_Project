 A good text should always be concise. If you cannot convey your message in less than 200 characters, you should probably write an email or call your contact instead.
 A text is sometimes the first point of contact with a potential employer or someone you like. The best way to make a good first impression is to make sure that your text is mistake-free.Most modern phones and tablets have automatic spelling checkers and dictionaries. They are not always perfect but can still detect most mistakes.
if you are unsure about the quality of your text, keep it short and simple.
If your phone can access the internet, quickly check a grammatical rule online.
Avoid abbreviations as much as you can. They might be useful to save words but will inevitably diminish the overall impact of your text.
 Before you start writing, think of what your interlocutor will need to know. Think of what you want to say and make it easy for the reader to answer you. If youâ€™re asked a question, offer a clear answer and make sure to use only one text.


Try to anticipate a question. If you are asked where to meet, give a precise location and the time of the rendezvous.
Make sure that your interlocutor knows who you are. Not everybody has your phone number saved. If you text someone you barely know, identify yourself at the beginning of the message.
 Smileys and other emoticons are great to encapsulate your mood quickly or make a conversation more dynamic but they should be used properly. Although there are exceptions, moderation is generally advised when using emoticons. Your interlocutor will probably prefer reading your writing than looking at a generic yellow man.


If you have any doubt, use emoticons only with family, friends and partner. You might want to avoid emoticons with your boss, colleagues or people you know less.

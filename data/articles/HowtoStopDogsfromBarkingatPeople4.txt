 Using a quiet room is the best option for training. Having your dog’s full attention will help it learn any new commands., Short words that are easy to understand, such as "shh" or "quiet," are helpful. Choose a gesture to help reinforce the command, such as putting your finger to your lips or making a fist. Be consistent and use the command and gesture every time.
 Perhaps counter-intuitively, you need to get your dog to bark to teach her how to be quiet. You could have someone ring the doorbell, or you could rattle a toy that gets her worked up.Allow the dog to bark two or three times.Make a sudden gesture to surprise the dog and stop him barking.
 When training the dog you do not give a command while the dog is barking. Instead, you while he is quiet, you give a food reward and simultaneously give your "Quiet" command.


Do not reward the dog until the dog is quiet.
It can help to gently close your dog’s mouth while you repeat the quiet command., Use the quiet command until your dog can be quiet on cue. Remember that it can take some time for your dog to learn new behaviors, so be patient and be consistent!


When she stops, pause for a second and then praise her. Give her treats and encourage the silence.

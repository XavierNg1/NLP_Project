 The oils from your scalp and pores are natural protectants. They repel water, and since dyes are water-based, they are your first defense against stained skin. Try to wait at least one day after your last shampoo to dye your hair. Bonus: hair dye adheres better to dirty hair than it does to slippery, clean hair.

, Using petroleum jelly, moisturizing cream, or a thick lotion to create a protective wall just outside of your hairline, around the entirety of your head. You should apply this layer thickly, but there’s no need to make it extend too far down your head. Half an inch to an inch of moisturizer should be plenty.








Be careful not to get your protectant of choice in your hair, and don't forget the tops and undersides of your ears.
Don’t use a moisturizer that breaks you out, or you could get acne around your hairline.
 For extra protection, press teased-out cotton balls, or cotton coil, into the moisturizer you applied. This way, if any hair dye manages to seep out of the hairline, the cotton will soak it up.








If the moisturizer isn’t sticky enough to hold the cotton, don’t panic--just apply more moisturizer over it, and forget about the cotton.
 If you don’t have any moisturizer thick enough to get the job done, don’t despair. Instead, you can use a lightly adhesive painter’s, masking, or gaffer’s tape applied to the edge of your hairline. Be careful not to catch your hair in the tape, and definitely don’t use another type of tape (like masking or duct) instead!Be careful when pulling tape off. Masking tape can potentially pull out or irritate the soft, fine hair known as vellus hair that covers your body, including your face.

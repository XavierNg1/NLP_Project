 Search online for "marriage records" and the name of the country your friend last lived in, or her state if she lived in the US. These records are often only available in person, but your state or county website should direct you to the office where you can check these in person.


If you do find a marriage record, but no accompanying contact information, you still have the name of a new person to search for (the spouse), as well as a potential change of name to take into account.
 In the United States, if your friend donated more than $250 to a political campaign, her name is recorded on the Federal Election Committee website, often with an address as well.
 Again, you'll need to search for "court records" along with the name of the country or state your friend lived in, as there is no single database where you can look these up. In many cases, you'll need to file a request with a specific court to get more information, so this method can take a fair amount of time.Do not be fooled by scam sites that charge you money to search government databases.
 To search this database for free, inquire of your local Electoral Registration Office, or ask your local library staff whether the service is available.You can also pay a few pounds to a private company to perform this search for you.

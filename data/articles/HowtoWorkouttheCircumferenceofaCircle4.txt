 You can measure the circumference of circles you find in the real world, not just in word problems. Try it out on a bicycle wheel, a pizza, or a coin.
 The string must be long enough to wrap around the circle once, and flexible enough that it can wrap tightly. You'll need something to measure the string with later, such as a ruler or tape measure. The string will be easier to measure if the ruler is longer than the piece of string.
 Start by placing one end of the string against the edge of the circle. Loop the string around the circle and pull it tight. If you are measuring a coin or other thin object, you might not be able to pull the string tight around it. Lay the circular object flat instead and arrange the string around it, as close to it as you can get.


Be careful not to wrap more than once. You should end up with a single loop of string, so there is no part of the circle with two lengths of string next to it.
 Find the place on the string that completes the loop, touching the end of the string that you started with. Mark this place with a permanent marker, or use a pair of scissors to cut it at this points

, Take the loop of string and measure it on a ruler. If you used a marker, only measure from the end of the string to the colored mark. This is the part of the string that was wrapped around the circle, and since a circle's circumference is just the distance around the circle, you've found the answer! The length of this string is the same as the circumference of the circle.

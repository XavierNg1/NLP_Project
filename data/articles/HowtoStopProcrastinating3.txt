 Make a record of all the tasks you need to accomplish. The list should include both short-term tasks you need to finish daily and weekly, as well as long-term goals that may take months or even years to accomplish. Seeing it written down will help you plan out the various actions needed to meet all your goals.Put this list on paper. Even if you use your phone for all of your other lists, from groceries to birthday wishes, don’t put this list on there. The act of writing out your tasks is key to thinking through how to finish them.
 Use a planner to schedule your time. Write short-term tasks in daily or weekly lists that include deadlines for each item. Set deadlines for long-term goals by listing them in monthly entries.Include everything you need to get done in your planner. Say that on Friday your final biology project is due. Set aside at least three nights to finish it. You’ve also got to go to the pharmacy and pick up a new toothbrush and vitamins before you leave for vacation. Do this on Thursday night. You’re also taking the SAT in a month, so spend at least three hours this week practicing vocab.
 Multitasking makes you feel like you’re accomplishing a lot, but it actually prevents you from finishing tasks quickly and effectively. Keep your attention on one goal at a time, and give it your all. This will also help you avoid getting overwhelmed by your busy schedule., It’s hard to stay away from distractions and do your work on time when you’re doing it alone. Luckily (or unluckily), everyone struggles with procrastination. Ask a friend or family member if they’d be willing to partner up with you to check in on each other’s work habits and accomplishments.


You can plan fun outings with your buddy to reward both of you when you meet your goals. If you keep procrastinating, cancel these events as a little bit of punishment.

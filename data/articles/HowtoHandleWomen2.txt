 While some people believe that women are more emotional than men, that is not necessarily the truth. Research has revealed that men and women simply process emotions differently. The types of situations that provoke an emotional response in women is different than that of men. Instead of dismissing a woman's emotional response, try to get an understanding of what is causing her response.
 One great benefit of relationships is that others may be strong where you are not so strong, which can be highly beneficial to your life. When you are honest about areas where the woman in your life is stronger, it can be of great benefit to you in the long run.
 Some women need personal time and space. How much varies, but generally speaking, you should not be intimated by phone calls and text messages from friends, nor should you feel compelled to monitor them. As long as you trust each other you should not worry about the time that she is away from you.


You should also avoid being controlling and allow her to be her own person by not trying to dictate how she should live her life., There should be a mutual respect for each others career without one person diminishing the other based on the nature of their job. If the woman makes more money, this should not cause a rift or any feelings of insecurity.
 Whether you are in a serious relationship or just friends, a good compliment is often appreciated. When complimenting a woman, be sincere and do not just focus on her physical attributes.


There are many aspects of a woman besides her physical appearance that deserves attention. Consider complimenting her intelligence, sense of humor, creativity, cooking skills, or compassion for others.

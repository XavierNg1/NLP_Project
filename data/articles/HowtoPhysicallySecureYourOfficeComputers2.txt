 Proximity alarms will alert you when equipment is removed outside of a specific radius.


Verify that the appropriate radius is programmed into the alarm receivers. This will prevent false alarms from occurring when employees take laptops with them to meetings or to other sections of the office building.
 A central location will accurately track computers based on the radius programmed into the transmitter.


Keep the receivers with your security staff if possible, since your security guards may be the best source for assistance in the event office computers are being stolen.

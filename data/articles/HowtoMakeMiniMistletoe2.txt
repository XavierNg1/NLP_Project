 Download, print and cut out the mistletoe template. Then place the template on top of a large piece of green felt and trace around it with a pen. To make one decoration you will need to trace three sprigs.You can use a regular pen or a fabric pen to trace the mistletoe sprigs on the felt.
You can find the template here http://www.essentials.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mistletoe-template.pdf


, Using a pair of scissors, cut out the sprigs and glue them together using a hot glue gun. Separate the springs a little and be sure to glue them together at the stem, not the end with the leaves, to create a bunch. The leaves should hang down with only a little overlap between them., Using the hot glue gun, attach six to eight white beads to the felt sprigs. Glue them together in small bunches of two and three so that they look like mistletoe berries. Then take about six inches (15 cm) of red ribbon and tie a bow around the spot where you glued the sprig stems together.Tying the bow around the spot where you glued the stems together is festive and will help hide the dark spot created by the glue.
 Take about three inches (7.5 cm) and create a loop. Use the hot glue gun to attach the loop to the backside of the decoration. Glue it to the same spot where you attached the springs and the ribbon.Once the hot glue dries, your decoration is ready to hang.

 There is a medal for giving stickers to fantagians, so be nice and give out stickers! Sometimes, people will be nice and give you a sticker also! There is a medal for people giving you a certain amount of stickers.
 Sell them at Lucky Bob's (also you can get stars from selling things)or try Trade N' Sell (you can make an offer but 200 stars got to go to fantage and you probably have to pay 10 ecoins)

, On the Comet, Fantage's weekly magazine, they have a contest. So enter a contest and see if you win! Even if you don't win, you still get a Participant's ribbon/medal.

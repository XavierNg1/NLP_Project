 Just open your favorite browser, and type in https://www.linkedin.com. This will bring you to the LinkedIn home page where you will need to log in.;
, Once you’re on LinkedIn’s home page, enter your email address and password into the text fields on the upper right corner of the screen. Click on “Sign In” to access your account.
 On your profile page, look to the right of the screen for the thumbnail version of your profile picture. Hover over the photo to display a drop-down menu.


Towards the bottom of this list is the option “Privacy and Settings” with a blue “Review” button beside it. Click on the button to load your profile settings.
In case the system prompts you to log in again, just do so. It’s simply a security measure.
 Once your profile settings are loaded on the screen, scroll down to the bottom of the page, and look to the left where you will see different setting submenus.


Click on the one labelled “Account” to load its own settings to the right.
 On the first row of the just-loaded settings, scroll down and click on the tab labelled “Select your language.” This will open a pop-up window.


The pop-up window will then display all of the different languages available on LinkedIn. Click on the language you prefer, and this will automatically change the site’s language to the one you just selected.

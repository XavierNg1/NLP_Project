 You don't need a special model of microwave to place it on a shelf, but you do need to know where the vents are for proper installation


Countertop models usually have vents on the sides and top of the microwave, but back panel vents are common as well.If you are having trouble finding the vents, place the microwave on a table, plug it in, and heat food or liquid inside. Place your hand near each side of the microwave to feel for blowing air.
 This is especially wise if your cabinet is high up, since the table can easily fall out of the microwave during lifting.
 Make sure the vents are not flush against any surfaces or objects. There should be at least an inch of space next to each vent., If the cord will not reach or is in an inconvenient location, temporarily remove the microwave and drill a small hole in the cabinet or shelf to snake the cord through.
 Because the cabinet does not allow as much air movement around the vents, dust will gradually build up and increase the risk of fire.Wipe the vents with a damp cloth while the microwave is turned off.

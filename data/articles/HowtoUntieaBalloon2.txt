 Hold the balloon so the inflated portion is wedged into your lap. Secure the balloon gently but firmly using your thighs.
 Try to follow where the knot loops around itself. Visualize how the knot was formed.
 Continue this until you are able to get part of the knot to yield.Focus on particular loops of the knot when pushing and pulling. The goal is to loosen and grip a single strand of the knot.
 Lodge your fingernail into one of the loops. Try to get a secured grip of that particular loop. You'll need to work on loosening the knot for a while before you can secure a section of the knot.


This is easier if your fingernails are long.
 Once you grip a strand of the knot, locate its connecting loop. Using your other hand, pry out the folded loop underneath the other loop. By prying one loop of the knot with one hand, you should be able to loosen this part of the knot., Once you've separated two loops of the knot, there should be a small opening. Wedge your fang tooth into the opened crevice. By pulling with your hands, gently, the knot should loosen and untie.

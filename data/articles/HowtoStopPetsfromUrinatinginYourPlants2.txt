 If your pets can’t get to the plants, they will not be able to urinate in them. For cats or small dogs, place the plants on the tops of tall pieces of furniture. For larger dogs, you may have to move the plants to areas of your home where your dog is not allowed to go.If you have large plants, it may not be practical to move them.
Be aware that your cat may be able to jump on top of furniture to get to the plants.
If moving the plants is not practical or doesn't work, you will need to use other strategies to keep your pets away from those plants.
 Repellent sprays are available at gardening centers that can keep pets away from plants. However, the repellent can wear off and become less effective over time.If you decide to try a repellent spray, follow the label instructions carefully.
 If you can’t block your cat’s access to the plants, make them undesirable. For example, place chicken wire on top of the soil, bending it upwards so your cat can’t easily step on it. Other ideas for undesirable items are:Aluminum foil or irregularly shaped pebbles placed on the soil
Double-sided tape or citronella spray around the top of the pot
Citrus peels around the plant

, If your dog is urinating in your indoor plants, especially if you have a male dog, it is likely marking its territory. If moving your plants is not feasible, give your dog something positive to do in the area with the plants, such as eating or playing. Once your dog associates that area with a positive activity, it will be less likely to urinate on your plants.Dogs will also urinate indoors if they feel stressed. If you know which stressful event (a visitor to your home) triggers the urination, distract your dog with another activity when that event occurs. For example, if you have a friend come over, give your dog a food puzzle toy to play with to keep it busy and less stressed.

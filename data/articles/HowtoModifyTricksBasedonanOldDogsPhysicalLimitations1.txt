 As your dog ages, it may suffer from joint pain and arthritis. Because of this, certain repetitive tricks may be painful or difficult for your dog to perform. For example, avoid having your dog repeatedly sit and lay down. This will aggravate its aching joints.In general, try to limit how often you have your elderly dog perform physically complicated or demanding tricks.
Emphasize easy tricks like speak, kiss, or heel.;
, Do not have your pet do tricks like sit, stand, or lie down for an extended period. This puts extra pressure on their joints and muscles. Be sure to limit the duration and frequency of these kinds of tricks. Instead, encourage tricks like touch or smile that limit joint wear and tear.Let your older dog lay down and avoid having sit or stand for a long period.
 Although your dog may love fetching things, too much excessive physical activity can be hard on its joints and muscles. Instead, maintain the physical activity, just tone it down a little. Do not have your dog run as far to fetch things or jump so high to retrieve them. In general, try to slow things down and make them a little easier.For example, if you are playing fetch, throw the ball or stick half as far as you normally would. You could also throw the object as far as you did before, just do not do it as often.

 If you've got a few minutes before the bell rings, let your mind wander a bit. Think about what you're going to do after school or where you'd travel in the world if you could go anywhere. Make believe you can fly or have some other super power. Just let your mind wander, and take a little break. When you come back, you'll realize more time has passed than you would have expected.








Don't let your imagination wander too far. Try to refocus on class material by incorporating it into your flights of fantasy. For example, if you're bored in math class, try to include the day's lesson in a fantasy about robots to keep you grounded and learning. Do these robots battle each other using the quadratic equation?;
, If your teacher doesn't make the rounds to see what you're writing, you can try drawing in your notebook as the teacher talks. If you tilt the notebook toward you, you'll look like you're taking notes, but you'll actually be making the time pass more quickly.
 This method may work even better than doodling. As long as your teacher doesn't look too closely at what the words are, it will definitely look like you're taking notes. Write a journal entry or write a note to your best friend. Alternatively, try writing a short story based on something you see in the room. What's that stapler's life story, for instance?







, With everything your teacher says, try to turn it into a rhyme. For instance, if your teacher says, "The climate in Spain is very wet." You could think, "When in Spain, it will rain." As an added bonus, you'll still partially be paying attention.
 Pick something to count. You can count the number of times your teacher uses the letter "z" or the number of times she says "Listen!" Counting forces you to stay awake and can help you lose track of the time.

 Raincoats with hoods can provide added protection from the rain. For example, if you donâ€™t have an umbrella handy, you can put on your hood to protect your hair from the elements. Consider a detachable hood, so that you can change the style and look of your raincoat depending on the severity of the weather., You can add style to your raincoat by selecting jackets with additional buttons and belts. For example, a traditional trench coat style rain jacket is double breasted and features ten buttons on the front. You can also find jackets that have a variety of buckles and belts to add detailing to the coat., A raincoat should be made from waterproof or water resistant material that is breathable. For example, Gore-Tex is a breathable and waterproof material that prevents you from sweating profusely while wearing a raincoat. Gore-Tex is typically used for raincoats that are suited for activewear, but can also be found in more stylish jackets as well.You can also stay dry with a raincoat made from cotton, nylon, or polyester.

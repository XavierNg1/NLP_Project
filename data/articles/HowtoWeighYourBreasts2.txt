 The diameter and volume of standard cup sizes can be used to calculate the estimated weight of breasts. If you know your typical cup size, you can get a relatively accurate picture of how much your breasts weigh.The issue with this method is that bras are not custom-made to fit the individual breasts of a woman. Two women who both wear a size 36B might have very different breast weights.
There is no common standard manufacturers use to determine bra sizes, so it can be tricky to know your true size. The best way to use this method is to try on bras in many different stores and figure out your average size.
 Once you're fairly sure where you fall on the spectrum of bra sizes, use the chart below to figure out how much your breasts might weigh. These weights were determined by calculating the volume of the breast using the average underwire size and cup diameter of common bra brands.

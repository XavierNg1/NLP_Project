 Heat the sugar in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over a medium heat, stirring with a fork. When the sugar starts to melt, stop stirring and cook, swirling the pan occasionally so the sugar will melt evenly. The sugar is ready when it turns dark amber in color.
 Remove the saucepan containing the caramelized sugar from the heat. Add in the cup of heavy cream, along with a pinch of salt. The mixture will bubble and steam, but don't worry, this is normal. Return the saucepan to the heat and stir until the caramel has dissolved.
 Roughly chop the chocolate using a sharp knife. Remove the saucepan from the heat and add in the chopped chocolate. Whisk continuously, until the chocolate has melted.
 Whisk in the vanilla extract, along with the Cognac or brandy, if using.
 Keep the chocolate sauce warm until you are ready to serve the profiteroles. Cover the saucepan and place over a low heat, stirring occasionally.

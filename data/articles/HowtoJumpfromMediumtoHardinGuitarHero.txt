 Instead of having your index finger on green, slide it up to the red fret. It is much easier (at least for most people) to stretch from the red fret to the green fret with your index finger than stretching to orange with your pinky. This may take a while to get used to. Try the intro to Sweet Child O' Mine until you can do pretty well on it. If you want to practice on medium, use the hand position and reach to press the green button.;
, I recommend Jessica and Less Talk More Rokk on expert for practice. If you are still on medium it will probably be too hard on expert so try it in practice mode on a slower speed. A good song for practicing hammer-ons and pull-offs on medium is Killing in the Name. While this is not necessary, it is highly recommended to succeed on hard and expert.
 Basically alt-strumming is strumming up and down, instead of only using down-strums. This is very useful when notes come fast at you (Misirlou). There are many ways to alt-strum, such as holding the strum bar like a pick and strumming up and down that way, with the palm of your hand, or your elbow (strange, but surprisingly effective).
 Chances are, you haven't spent hours upon hours in practice mode on easy or medium practicing solo 7 in Hangar 18. Well, once you get to hard and expert, you'll have to. Find a certain spot in the song that will allow you to do better if you hit it. This doesn't necessarily mean the hardest part. Star Power phrases and parts leading into hard parts (to keep your ROCK meter in green) are good ones to practice.

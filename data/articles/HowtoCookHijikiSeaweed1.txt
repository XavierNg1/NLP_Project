 Place the hijiki in a large mixing bowl. Add 4 cups (946 ml) of water. Let it sit for half an hour so the hijiki can absorb as much moisture as possible., While the hijiki soaks, boil enough water to pour over all of the aburaage’s surface. Once the water has boiled, place the aburaage in a large, fine sieve. Pour the water over it to wash off the manufacturer’s oil and improve its flavor., First, transfer the aburaage to a cutting board. Slice it in half lengthwise first, then thinly slice each half widthwise. Next, julienne your carrots. Finally, slice the lotus root thinly., Place it in a small pot. Add enough water to cover. Bring the water to a boil and let the konnyaku cook in it for another three minutes. Then drain through your sieve., By now, the hijiki should be rehydrated or close to it. Once the half-hour’s up, pour the hijiki and water into the sieve to drain. Then place the sieve under a faucet. Wash and rinse the hijiki under running water., Coat the bottom of a medium-sized pot with the vegetable oil. Set the burner to medium-low heat. Add the carrots and lotus root once the oil has heated. Stir until they are evenly coated in the oil. Then add your hijiki, konnyaku, and aburaage and stir until evenly mixed., First, add the dashi and stir to combine. Then do the same with your mirin, sugar, and soy sauce. Cover the pot and cook for half an hour., Once the half hour’s up, stir in your edamame. Then let the salad cook uncovered and keep an eye on the liquid. Remove from heat once it’s reduced to the point that the bottom of the pan is visible. Serve warm if desired or let it cool if desired.Leftovers can last up to 3 to 4 days when refrigerated in an airtight container.

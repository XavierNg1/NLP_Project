 Often times, you’ll be given a timeframe for your interview. If the interview lasts longer than scheduled, this is a very good sign. This shows that they’ve moved beyond the script and spent additional time getting to know you and/or selling you on the job.If your interview was short, but you really feel like you clicked with the interviewer and other people you met, this can still be a good sign. Especially if they end with something like, "I think we've heard all we need to know," in a positive and upbeat way.
 Although this by itself is not a definitive sign, when an employer invites you to call or email with additional questions, this can be a mark for the positive. If this invitation comes alongside a few other positive signals, consider this a good sign!If extended this invitation, you should take them up on it!
Wait a day or two and then email them with a couple of well-thought out questions.
Ensure that your email is professional, gracious, and free from errors.
 When a company wants to hire you, they will almost always leave you with some kind of clear timeframe. For example, they might say, “We should be making a decision this week. We will contact you either way by Monday.”A specific date (e.g., Monday) is always a stronger sign than "we'll get in touch next week."
However, "we'll get in touch next week," is still better than a blanket, "we'll be in touch."

, If you are asked about your current availability (particularly when you’d be able to start), this can be an excellent sign. This can mean that they’d like to begin figuring out your place in the schedule. Make sure you know exactly when you’ll be available before you head to your interview.
This shows that you've already considered this job a possibility and figured out how to fit it into your life.
 There is no sign more definitive than an actual job offer! If your interview ends with an invitation to join the team, congrats! You have succeeded in getting the job.

 According to some sources, the grade of hair extensions does not indicate the quality of the hair at all, but rather the length of the strands. For example, in a bundle of 18 inches (45.72 cm) hair extensions, not every strand will measure the full 18 inches (45.72 cm). The higher the number of strands per bundle that measure the full length, the greater the grade of the hair. Look carefully through your bundle to evaluate the proportion of full-length hairs to shorter-hairs.Grade A (1A) hair will have 50% or less full-length strands.
Grade AAA (3A) will have around 70% full-length strands.
Grade AAAAA (5A) and up should have at least 90% full-length strands.
 Single-drawn hair bundles, and bundles that are essentially gathered together once, and then trimmed to the desired length (such as 18 inches/45.72 cm). This process results in around 50% of strands that are the full-length of the bundle. Double-drawn hair bundles are processed twice, achieving closer to 90% of strands that are full-length. Fold a bundle of hair extensions in half and look for shorter hairs popping out. If you see this, most likely the hair has been single-drawn.If the non-uniform length of hair does not bother you, single-drawn hair is a more cost-effective option.
Both Remy and non-Remy hair can be either single or double-drawn.
 The higher the proportion of full-length hairs in a given bundle are the thicker the bundle will be. Furthermore, higher grade double-drawn hair should have a completely uniform thickness from top to bottom. If the bundle of hair seems to grow thinner towards the bottom, it is of a lower grade.

 Everyone has a hobby. Go escape when you're having a hard time. Getting lost in your hobby and having fun with it can really help you to forget about your problems. Some hobbies could be: art, movie-making, reading, inventing, writing stories/ books, whatever fits your personality.;
, There is always light at the other end of the tunnel.
 If you aren't so much of a people person, there's always that lady sitting in the cubicle next to you. Or maybe your math teacher. Anyone will do. They'll understand, everyone has gone through rough spots.
 Really, it helps!

, Your situation is not as hopeless as it seems. There are bright spots to it, you just have to seek them out. Even if they are completely silly, have a laugh about them. You're already on your way to diminishing your pessimistic outlook.
 Have a picture of a really fun time with you're best friends in Disney World or a note from a relative that said they loved you in your possession at all times.
 Do something fun with your friends or just by yourself. Treat yourself to something you've wanted for a while or just relax and surf the web for a couple hours.
 Talk to the person you think doesn't like you or is making you upset. Act like nothing is wrong; this way, they'll know that you're mature, cool, and strong. Talk or text this person as often as you did before.
 You can't change what happened, but you can change what will happen.

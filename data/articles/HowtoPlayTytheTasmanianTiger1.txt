 In a scene, you will see five mystic talismans that have been dislodged and are now lost.;
, You need 17 thunder eggs to do a boss fight.


You have to play three levels. One of them needs at least six thunder eggs. (You can get all 24 in each section of the first three, with 8 in each level.)
Once you get all seventeen or more, go to the Talisman Machine and get to the boss fight "Bull's Pen". You will get the talisman there.

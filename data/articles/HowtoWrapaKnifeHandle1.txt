 Before you start covering your handle with a cord or leather, you'll need to determine how much of it need to cover the entire handle. Use a ruler or tape measure to determine the length of your knife handle., If you're using a simple wrap, you'll want the cord to be five times larger than the length of the handle. If you're using a more advanced wrap, you'll want a foot of cord for every inch of the knife handle.For example, if your knife handle is 10 inches (25.4 cm) long, you'll need at least 50 inches (127 cm) of leather stripping for a simple wrap.
If your knife handle is 10 inches (25.4 cm) long and you want to use a more advanced wrap, have at least 10 foot (3 m) of cord or leather stripping.
 Use a razor blade or scissors to cut out a strip of leather to the length that you need. If you're using leather, the strip should be around 3/8 inches (9.52 mm) wide, so you'll have to cut the strip vertically if it's too wide.Having more cord is better than not having enough because you can always cut away the excess cord.
If you are cutting a strip of leather from rawhide, you'll have to tan the hide first.
 Soak the leather stripping in warm water for 30 minutes. Soaking leather makes it more pliable and makes wrapping it around your knife handle easier. If you're using paracord, the moisture will tighten it as it dries on your knife handle, which makes the wrap tighter. Once your ready to wrap the cord, remove it from your refrigerator and choose a wrap for your knife handle., If you're wrapping your knife handle immediately, you can just start to wrap the knife handle with the wet cord or leather stripping. If you are wrapping your knife handle later, wrap it in plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator to keep it moist.

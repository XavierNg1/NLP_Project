 Make sure that the straw is big enough to encircle the tick but not so big that there is too much room around it. The straw will act as a guide for the knot you will use to grab the tick.Although you can perform this operation on yourself, depending on where the tick is located, it is best to have someone help you. If you, or someone else, are unable to remove the tick, have a doctor remove it safely.
 Using either thread or dental floss, create a loose knot on your straw. Do not make it so tight that you cannot move it on the straw or so loose that it does not grab onto anything.The goal is to have a knot that can move on the straw.
 Once it has reached the tick, position the knot under the tick’s belly. This will encircle the embedded head and mouth of the tick, making it easier to remove the entire insect.Avoid tying the knot around the tick’s body. This will cause it to regurgitate its stomach contents into the wound.
 Gently and carefully pull the knot tighter. Pulling too forcefully or quickly may tear the tick. Your goal is to create a knot that closes off the tick’s throat and prevents regurgitation., Get the straw out of your way and begin pulling upwards on the tick with a steady motion. After a few moments, the tick will detach without spilling its stomach contents.Be sure to kill the tick and dispose of it.

 To see the permissions you already have on files use the Ls command with the -l option (picture 1);
, This will determine how you will write the chmod command, and where you put each number.
 These are the permission details (r for read),(w for write)(x for execute) this will allow the user, group or other person to read( open) the file, write (make changes) to the file or execute ( run) the file. The Number used for R is 4 the number used for W is 2 and the number used for X is 1 which equals 7 there is some math required to do this. (refer to both charts in the notes section)


For example, if you wanted to add the Read permission and the write permission to only users you would write the command you would add 4 for read and 2 for write so the permissions on your file would look like what you see in picture 2 for the file user.(refer to the chart in the notes section for the chart of numerical values of permissions).
 These represent Users|Groups|Other from left to right. Putting a number from 1-7 in any of the three parts will change permission for each one depending on what numbers you use.
 Just be sure to use the absolute path of the folder so you donâ€™t make a mistake (i.e. My test folder located in /home/permissiondemo/test). If you are not sure just look at the picture 3

, If it worked, good job. If not try again.( If you forget what the command looks like refer back to picture 1 the first command used)

,, The results should vary.

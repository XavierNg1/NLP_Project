 Your squad is there to help you have fun, but being part of the group also means looking out for one another. Watch each other's backs and drinks.


When a girlfriend starts to get a little too drunk, cut her off. She may be upset with you, but she'll thank you in the morning.
If a creepy guy won't leave your girlfriend alone, tell him to take a hike.
Make sure each of you gets home safely when the night is over. If you live in a place without good public transportation, having a designated driver can literally save your life.
 Party girls are all about fun. Sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies are decidedly not fun. Making out with a guy you just met can be fun, but be careful who you decide to sleep with.


Always make sure your partner wears a condom. Be sure that it's not a "natural" or "lambskin" condom, as these do not protect against HIV.
Remember that sex always carries some risk. Condoms can always break. There is no such thing as completely safe sex, only safer sex., Most party girls drink alcohol as part of having fun, but you shouldn't overdo it. Don't drink past your limits. You don't want a fun night on the town to ruin your health.


Avoid drinking if you are under the legal age to buy alcohol. Don't give in to peer pressure even if all of your friends drink.
Never drive drunk.
 Drugs can be a big part of many party scenes, and some party girls like to partake. These substances can be harmful by themselves, but they may also include unknown and deadly impurities. Don't take any pills offered to you at a party.

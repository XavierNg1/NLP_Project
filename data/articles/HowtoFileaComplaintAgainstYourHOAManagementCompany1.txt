 Emergencies include things like no heat or hot water or a pest infestation.The housing inspector should come out and investigate.


Try to get a copy of the investigator’s report. You should keep it for your records.;
, Every homeowners association (HOA) should have Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions, called “CC&Rs.” You should have received a copy when you moved in. Take out your copy and read them. These rules should explain the process for filing complaints against HOA management.


If you don’t have your CC&Rs, then contact the HOA and ask for a copy. Because many states require that you exhaust your remedies with the HOA first, you need to follow the complaint process in the CC&Rs.
 You may have to write a letter complaining to HOA management. You should set it up like a standard business letter. Set the font to something readable, such as Times New Roman 12 point.
 In the letter, you should explicitly state what problem you are having with the HOA’s management company. Provide as much detail as possible, including dates and any witnesses.


For example, the management company might have denied you access to look at their books. You can write, “I made an in-person request on September 1, 2016 to review the books. However, Ms. Smith told me that I would need permission from the entire board even though Section 12.3 of the CC&Rs gives all members a right to review the HOA books. On September 15, 2016, the entire board turned down my request at its monthly meeting.”

, Make sure that you mail your letter certified mail, return receipt requested to the HOA.You will need proof that HOA management received it, and the receipt serves as that proof.


Also remember to keep a copy of the letter for your records.

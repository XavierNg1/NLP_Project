 A cake farm is actually a bunch of smaller farms put together, so you will need quite a bit of space.;
, Make a small pen with wooden fences, then gather some chickens and put them inside. You can make the pen bigger or smaller depending on how many chickens you choose to put in it.
 Build another pen with fences, but make this one slightly bigger than the chicken pen. Find some cows and put them in it. If you like, you can place a chest full of empty buckets next to the cow farm.
 Dig a few holes in the ground and fill them with water using a bucket. Put sugar cane on the ground around the water.
 Use a hoe and till some of the dirt on the ground or place down some dirt blocks. Plant seeds on the tilled soil. If you want, dig some dirt around the wheat and fill it with water (this will help it to grow faster).

 If you think the amount of work is too much for you, ask the parents of the child (or children) if you can have a friend over (the parents would most likely be more comfortable with two girls babysitting rather than a girl and guy);
, This will make the parent feel that you are responsible enough to look after their child because you want to know how to care for their child and you understand that each child has different needs and remedies.
 If they are eight or older they will want some privacy but make sure to check up on them often.
 This will distract them and keep them from getting into trouble. Try playing tag, catch, or Hide The Object (one person hides an object the other tries to find it. This is a safer alternative to Hide-and-Seek) for kids 5-7. For babies, play Peek-A-Boo and tickle them. For toddlers (kids 2-4), play tag, catch with a foam ball, or build an obstacle course and try to complete it with the child. For kids eight and up, play board games and possibly multi-player video games (if you are allowed to and feel comfortable with it).
 If the child has a set bedtime, tire them out that day, but about an hour or so before bedtime wind them down and get them into their pajamas. Do some quiet activities like reading a bedtime story, having a glass of water or warm milk, or listening to quiet, gentle music, perhaps lullabies.
 You never know when the parents may find out about your snooping. Keep within your limits in the home.

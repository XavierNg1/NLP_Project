 Especially around election time, people often post their opinions on political topics and candidates. Scroll through their recent posts to see if you can find anything containing hints about their political leanings.Facebook “likes” can be used to predict a user's religion, IQ, sexuality, substance use, and political beliefs.
 If you have heard your friend discuss sensitive political topics in the past, their opinion can give you an idea of which party they belong to. Abortion. Republican voters usually believe that life begins at conception, that abortion should be illegal, and that public funds should not be used to support medical clinics that perform abortions. Democrats are more likely to believe that women should be able to control what happens to their own body, and that the government should help subsidize clinics for women who cannot afford an abortion.
Gay marriage. Most Democrats are social liberals who believe in marriage equality for LGBT partners. The typical Republican is more likely to believe that marriage should be limited to heterosexual couples.
Sex education. As a general rule, liberals think school programs should educate teens about sex and pregnancy. Conservatives often believe that schools should only tell children to abstain from sex completely.
 In general, conservatives tend to prefer Fox News, and distrust many other sources of news as having a “liberal bias.” Liberals are more likely to listen to NPR and read the New York Times., Although there are tons of exceptions to this rule, in general conservatives tend to dress more modestly (conservatively), and liberals tend to be more adventurous and express themselves more through their wardrobe choices.

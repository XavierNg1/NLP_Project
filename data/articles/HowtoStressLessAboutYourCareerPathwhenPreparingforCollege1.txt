 As many as eighty percent of college students will graduate with a major that is different from the one they declared at the beginning of their college careers. This means you can relax a little instead of feeling that the decisions you make today are final.You can limit the stress of possibly switching majors by focusing on core and introductory major classes during your first year.
Many core and introductory courses can transfer easily into your new major if you decide to switch.;
, Donâ€™t look at your college major as a permanent career decision. Instead think of it as a place from which you will jump into the working world. Your career will build upon the knowledge, skills, and experiences you gain in college, but that does not mean your major will define your path in life.Try to enrich your knowledge, skills, and experiences beyond your major by taking elective courses in other subjects, participating in internships, and seeking out new experiences like studying abroad or taking a gap year.
 No matter how well laid your career plan might be, chances are it will change over the course of your lifetime. You can stress less about choosing the perfect career path by knowing that the type of work you do will shift during your life.For example, a theatre major who intended to have a career in performance might end up as a successful project management specialist in the arts sector.

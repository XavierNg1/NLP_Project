 Wash the blister(and your hands) with warm, soapy water., You may prefer to drain large painful blisters instead of letting them pop on their own. Draining your own blister is a sanitary way to help it heal faster and reduce the pain you might feel from the swollen area.Disinfect a sewing needle by cleaning it with a cotton ball dipped in rubbing alcohol.






Insert the needle into the side of the blister. You shouldn't feel pain when you puncture the blister, since the skin bubble doesn't contain nerves.






Press the blister. Fluid should begin flowing from the puncture hole. Drain the blister completely by pressing it with your finger. Use a cotton ball to wipe away the fluid.
 The deflated blister skin will protect the skin underneath from getting infected. There's no need to tear or cut it off.
 Use a cotton swab to apply polymyxin B or bacitracin antibiotic ointment to the area. This will prevent the wound from becoming infected and keep the bandage from sticking to your skin.Many people are allergic to antibiotic ointments. If the area becomes red and inflamed or itchy, discontinue use of the ointment.
If you're allergic to antibiotic ointment, you can use petroleum jelly to prevent the bandage from sticking to your skin. Make sure you use jelly from a new container; containers of jelly that have been used for other purposes might contain bacteria that can infect your wound.
 Use a Band-aid (plaster) or gauze to loosely bandage the area, so it still gets a little air flow. Make sure the tape doesn't touch the deflated blister.Change the bandage once a day, or every time it gets wet or dirty.
Check the area when you change the bandage. It should heal within a week or so. If it looks swollen, red, or begins leaking pus, seek medical attention.

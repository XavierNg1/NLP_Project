 From clothing to unused kitchen tools to furniture, you can probably find something to throw out. Donate objects in good condition to charity, and throw out the rest. As a rule of thumb, if you haven't used something in a year, you can probably get rid of it.


If you have not used an item in 12 months, it is most likely clutter. The same goes for anything that does not really bring you happiness, or does not function well--such as being broken, or too big or small.
A garage sale is another good way to give your stuff to people who need it more.
 If you have furniture that simply does not work for the space, consider renting a storage facility. This includes things like Grandma's china cabinet that you will use when you get a larger place. A storage locker is also good for rotating seasonal items, like clothing that you will only wear part of the year.Check with your property owner for nearby storage facilities. He or she may have some tips on the good ones nearby, and might even have a deal with one.
If you have a friend or relative with a large house, he or she may let you store these objects in an attic or basement for free.
Consider cost of storage, however. Storage units have a cost every month, which while modest, can really add up over time. Is it really worth hundreds of dollars to hold on to your old furniture?

, Scan your files and photographs to make digital copies. A single hard drive can easily store every paper record you have in the apartment. Just make sure to make at least one back up, so you don't lose the files to a technological error.
 Spare jars or plastic food containers can store the little, miscellaneous objects that build up. From children's toys to nails and screws, these are good to have around.


If you are out of room in your kitchen cupboards, store pasta and other dry food in empty jars. Place these on top of the kitchen cabinets for practicality and ambiance.

 A good one is rosemary because it is strong and stands upright, and has the lovely meaning of remembrance. Other possible herbs include lavender, thyme, sage, bay leaves and mint. Each carry their own meanings, something you might wish to check on before choosing.;
, Fresh is best. Brush off any dirt or debris. For each boutonniere, plan on about 3-5 sprigs each, depending on the herb type chosen.
 Usually about 10cm/4 inches will be long enough for a boutonniere. Strip off any leaves, twigs, etc. from the lower part of the stems, which will be wrapped.
 Wrap closely with the florist's wire or thin wire. Wrap from the bottom to the first leaf left on the stem.
 Keep this as neat as possible, making each overlap about the same width as each previous one. Glue in place as tightly as possible (or use a pin to secure).
 Use a corsage pin to attach the herb boutonniere. Done.

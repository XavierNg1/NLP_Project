 To start, pull the top section of your hair up into a bun or ponytail. Leave the hair near the nape of your neck untied. You will work on curling this section first., Take a spray on heat protectant. Mist a layer on the bottom section of your hair. Then, use your hands to work the protectant in so your hair is covered in a thin layer of heat protectant., Take a flat iron or curling iron. Starting with the tips of your hair, curl your hair lock by lock around the curling iron. Hold for a moment before releasing. Your hair should form waves.Alternate between curling each lock towards your head and then away from your head. This will create variation that makes for a casual beach wave style.
 Remove the hair tie from the top section of your head. Repeat the same process with this side of your head. Apply the heat protectant and then curl your hair in alternating directions., After curling both sides of your hair, spritz some sea salt spray onto your hair. Bunch your hair in your hands for a moment and then release it. This should give your hair a slightly messy feel that gives off the beach vibe.

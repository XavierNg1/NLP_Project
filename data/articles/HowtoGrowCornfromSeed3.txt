 For every one person who intends on consuming corn, plant ten to fifteen plants. If each plant is 100% successful, they should produce two ears of corn apiece.


Corn is wind-pollinated, so it is best to plant it in blocks rather than individual rows so that the pollen has a better chance of germinating.
Plant the seeds every 3 inches (7.5 cm) along rows, with 24–36 inches (61.0–91.4 cm) of space between rows. Plant at least four rows so the wind can spread pollen between them.Plant the seeds 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) below the surface of the soil, with each plant
To increase the odds of the seeds germinating, plant 2-3 seeds together at each placement.
If you grow multiple varieties of corn, be sure to grow them in separate plots to reduce the risk of cross-pollination. Should cross-pollination occur, it would produce tough, starchy kernels., Corn requires about one inch of water a week, and lax watering can produce ears with many missing kernels. Apply water to the base of the plants to prevent washing away pollen at the top of the plant., Keep the corn weed-free until it is about knee high. After that, your corn should out-compete the weeds on its own., As the saying “knee-high by the fourth of July” goes, your corn should be 12–18 inches (30.5–45.7 cm) tall by the beginning of July. The corn is finished growing about three weeks after it develops “tassels” - a dry, brown silk tail at the top of the ear.
 The corn is ready to be harvested when the kernels are tightly packed and produce a milky fluid when punctured. Eat immediately after picking for the best flavor and optimum freshness.

 Become friends with your clients on LinkedIn, Facebook, Google, and/or Twitter. Browse your feed on these websites regularly and look out for posts made by your clients. Also remember to update your own page regularly with information about your business efforts and links to relevant online articles., Certain online services offer ways to track mentions of your clients on social media or news platforms. Using one of these services, like Google Alerts, Talkwalker, or Mention, can help you find opportunities to get back in touch with your clients. You can set these services up to track the client's name, company, industry, or anything else of interest to them.


Once you get an alert on a client, try reaching out to them with a "this made me think of you" or "I heard about ____. What do you think about it?", When you see a posting of theirs which you like, comment on it or "like" it. This is especially important for blog posts or website article that your clients write. Many of these posts don't get any comments or "likes." This means that your interaction will stand out. Just make sure that you leave a thoughtful comment that shows that you actually read the piece., When you see your clients are online at the same time as you are, say hello now and then. Take advantage of the ease of Facebook messenger or Google Chat and check in on your clients., LinkedIn allows you to recommend other members based on business interactions you've had in the past. Use this service to write a glowing recommendation of the client. If you're subtle about it, you may even be able to plug your own services in the process.


You may also see an opportunity to link previous clients together in a shared business interest. Recommend one client to the other, and make the introduction.

 This is a very simple candy that only requires sugar and water. Not so great for the teeth, this is best left for an occasional treat.


Some variations on the basic sugar candy include maple sugar candy, sparkly sugar candy and Sweet and Low™ sugar candy.;
, Rock or crystallized candy is a prettier version of sugar candy that requires a little extra effort but not much! This type of candy is a great one for parties and school fairs. Note––this form of candy is not to be confused with pulled rock candy (see below).
 Toffee is another simple sugar treat that can be eaten plain or can be changed into many different flavors through the addition of flavoring extracts, nuts or fruit, and other items. There are quite a few possibilities here, including:


English toffee
Almond toffee
Marshmallow toffee
Bacon toffee

Toffee apple.
 This is a favorite treat for those attending fairs, showgrounds and sideshows. It's a little messy to make at home but it still tastes great!

, A perennial favorite for many, marshmallows are fun snack foods, at home, for camping and hiking and when stuck in the office all day!

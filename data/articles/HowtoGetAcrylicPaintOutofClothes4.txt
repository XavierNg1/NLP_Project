 Hold it under warm running water to try to flush out as much of the paint as possible.
 This is the solution you are going to use to attempt to get rid of the stain. This method is helpful because you are likely to have dish detergent on hand. 







, Dab and sponge the stain with vigor; avoid rubbing too much though, as this can spread the stain. Don’t be afraid to use your fingernails on the stain. Try to get out as much as possible.
 Check for the stain. You can repeat the detergent dabbing if needed or if you aren’t satisfied with the amount that came off. 







, Just wash these clothes the way you normally would wash them. Make sure the article of clothing can be machine washed. Now dry your clothes as you normally would and check for the stain again. Hopefully it has now gone.

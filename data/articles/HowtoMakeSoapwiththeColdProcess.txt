 Items needed are safety goggles, rubber gloves, a stainless steel pot, a glass bowl, a glass measuring bowl, a scale, rubber stirring utensils, thermometer (two thermometers if possible, one for the oils and one for the lye), the soap batch recipe, the recipe ingredients, and soap molds.;
, Important note: the caustic nature of the lye will etch the glass bowl making it appear frosted. The glass bowl will be fine but the look is permanent.
 The lye and water will react with each other and initially get very hot. Be sure to always add the lye to the water. Adding the water to the lye may cause a bubbling "volcanic" reaction.
,, It is recommended to wear the goggles and rubber gloves here in case of any lye splashes.
 Expect to stir continuously for about 15 minutes, until the mixture starts to thicken, like pudding. This is called the "trace" stage. Using an electric stick blender is one way to speed up the stirring and bring the soap mixture to the "trace" stage more quickly.
 Again, the "trace" stage can be recognized by the patterns left in the soap mixture as it is stirred. It will resemble a thickening pudding.
 Be sure that the soap mixture is evenly distributed.
 Wrapping the molds in a blanket or towel for insulation will keep the soap warm and accelerate the curing process.
 Remove the soap from the mold, cut in to bars and allow the bars to cure and dry out for 4-6 weeks.

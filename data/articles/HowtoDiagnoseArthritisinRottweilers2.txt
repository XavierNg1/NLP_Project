 If your dog shows signs of arthritis, take her to the vet. The vet will watch how the dog stands up from lying down, copes with stairs, and walks to get an idea of how mobile she is and which leg or legs are affected.


The vet will also feel the joints for heat and swelling, and then bend and extend each joint to see if it moves freely or movement is restricted., X-rays are common diagnostic tools for arthritis. However, in the early stages of osteoarthritis, which is before the joint swells and the bone is remodeled, it is possible to miss arthritis purely because the change hasn't happened yet.


X-rays can also help the vet troubleshoot for other causes of lameness, such as sprains, infection, fractures, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer.
 Depending on the clinic, your vet may suggest giving your dog a CT scan or an MRI. These methods are very expensive, however, and not available everywhere., If a joint is swollen, the vet may decide to tap the joint with a needle and syringe to draw off a small sample of joint fluid for analysis.


This can help eliminate joint infections, and confirm the swelling is down to inflammation.

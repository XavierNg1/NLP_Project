 Your spouse will be out there, with other people trying to create a better life for your family. He won't stop doing his job so he can come back to you, so stop torturing yourself with that sweet fantasy. They will be with you only for a small amount of time and you will feel lonely from time to time. This will become less and less painful as long as realise it is happening.;
, Open up about your feelings. When you are lonely, tell them, don't go through it alone.
 You can't be too clingy or it will hurt you both.
 Instead of fantasizing about the moment your spouse walks right into your home, know that you are still alive. Your spouse doesn't make you feel alive, living does. Have a great time alone! Speak with friends, go out, do things you love, try new things out. Don't let loneliness get to you.
 Your spouse is the person you fell for, the person you love. When together, cherish the moments! Have great sex, sleep together like it's the first time you're ever doing it, cuddle, give your spouse something to think about when he's back on that plane.
 You can talk on the phone with somebody and feel like he is next to you just like you can talk to one next to you and wonder if he is even listening. It is all a manner of communication. If you can communicate with your spouse deeply, don't worry, you are closer to him than anybody.

 Pour 1.5 cups (192 g) of flour and 3/4 cup (177.44 ml) of Mountain Dew in a bowl and mix them together with a fork or a whisk. You'll know when the mixture is ready when the dough has started to harden., Get powdered Jell-O from the store and use a measuring spoon to add a tablespoon of it to the mixture. This will help the bait bind together as it sits in the refrigerator., Cover the top of the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for 3-4 hours. During this time the bait will finish hardening., Remove the bowl from the refrigerator before you go fishing and roll the dough into 1/4 inch (.635 cm) balls that you can use for bite-sized bait. Bluegills are known to nibble on their food, making this bait a better solution than rolled up bread. You should use the bait within three days of making it.

 This should be something like running your hand across the belt area, and tell the team the code. For instance, the 'b' in 'belt' could be used to remember the 'b' in 'bunt'. You could also use other signals for a bunt.;
, It could be something like tapping your sleeve, 's' for 'steal'. Since there are two types of stealing, (after the pitcher throws, or once the catcher catches it), you should have two signals to differentiate between the two. For example, tapping the sleeve once could be for the steal off the pitcher, and twice for off the catcher.
 If you just scream to your pitcher, "do a change up!", the batter will be well prepared. Instead, use something like tapping your cheek, 'c' for 'change'. This will make it easy to understand.
 Just in case the player doesn't see your signal, have a repeat sign for them. Make sure the entire team knows this sign just in case.
 This is for the coach. This would be used if a sudden change in the game makes you change your mind about stealing. For instance, if the runner on third was planning on stealing home, and then two outs were made, you may want to cancel the play.

 This screensaver shows actual system information, and you can choose to have it mimic hard drive activity. It also scrolls through different blue screens and simulated boots every 15 seconds or so, making it very realistic. And, it's from Microsoft. Just download the zip file and extract "sysinternals.scr into your Windows\System32 directory, then choose it as the active screensaver.;
, Just open up BSoD Prank 1.0(BSoD.exe), then press Alt+Enter to initiate and Esc to end.
 RBSoD lets you choose a url to BSoD, as well as letting you choose between numerous error messages or, create your own message.
 The "Kernel Panic" may not be seen as often as the BSoD, but it is a part of a Mac users life regardless of what Apple wants you to think. KPSaver is a neat little screen saver prank developed by Doomlaser that simulates the dreaded "Kernel Panic", the equivalent of a Windows BSoD.
, This isn't really a Kernel Panic. You've been pranked. Just click the smiley face, and all will be fine."

, The BSoDomizer is a device that interfaces between a computer and it's VGA monitor, and allows the pranker to trigger it via infrared remote control. View a video of the BSoDomizer being tested here

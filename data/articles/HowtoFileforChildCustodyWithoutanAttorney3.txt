 In some states, the court will require you and the other parent to take part in mediation prior to going to court to resolve your custody issues. Mediation gives parents an opportunity to work out their disagreements outside of court and allows the parents to have a bigger impact on the decisions that are made.

In mediation, both parents will meet with an expert mediator and discuss their disagreements in an attempt to come to an agreed upon solution.If you and the other parent come to an agreement, the mediator will help you draft a parenting plan and that plan will then be submitted to the judge for approval., If you are not required to go through mediation or you and the other parent cannot come to an agreement during mediation, you will be required to go to your court hearing.At the court hearing, you can expect the judge to ask you and the other party a number of questions meant to give the judge an idea of who should be the caretaker of the child at issue. The judge's main concern is the well-being of the child. There are a number of responsibilities the judge will ask you about, so be prepared to answer some, if not all, of the following questions:


Who can most responsibly feed the child; spend time with the child; take the child to school; care for the child's medical needs; create a supportive home environment; arrange and take part in fun and educational activities; and provide a stable financial backing for the child.Look here for a list of factors a judge may take into consideration when deciding child custody issues.
 Once the judge reaches their conclusion, they will sign a court order.In some states, the clerk in the courtroom will prepare the judge's order and file it automatically.In other states, it will be the responsibility of the prevailing party to fill out a court order form and submit it for the judge's signature and filing.The court order is a document with the judge's decision and this document will set out exactly what the custody arrangement will be and how it will be enforced. You and the other parent will be required to follow this order or risk legal ramifications.

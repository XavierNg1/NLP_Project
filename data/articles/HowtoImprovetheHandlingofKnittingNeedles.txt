 There are a number of different ways to hold knitting needles and if you have been taught only one way but you've always found it uncomfortable, liberate yourself by trying a different holding method and seeing whether your comfort level improves.

The most common method for holding knitting needles is to hold the left hand needle with your left hand down about 2" (5cm) from the needle's point, similar to the way in which you'd hold a pencil to sharpen it. Then, hold the other needle in your right hand much like holding a pen. (Switch this around if you're left handed.);
, Wrapping the needles too tightly with yarn will make it harder to slide the stitches. This is partly a matter of practice and experience, so don't give up if your first few attempts at knitting seem a bit snug., Yarn labels typically suggest an appropriate size of needles for the yarn inside. While this is a suggestion and not a hard and fast rule, the yarn and needle size should be compatible.

Use a needle gauge to check the size of your knitting needles if they are not marked or you're not sure.
 Needles come in many materials, including wood, bamboo, plastic, ivory (antique), and metal. Try different needle materials with different yarns and see which combinations you like the most., Certain materials, such as cotton and some synthetics, don't slip on the needles as well as other yarn. You can still knit with these materials, but they may tend to tighten up more and slide less freely., It's easier to keep the work from slipping off of them when they're not in use.

Relax circular needles if they have been coiled too tightly for too long. If your circular needles are pulling back because they have been coiled up in storage, hold them in the steam from a teakettle or direct a hair dryer at them to loosen them up.
 Use cornstarch as a dry lubricant, spray with a dry silicone lubricant, or wax them with car wax or beeswax and buff with a dry cloth. Run the tips through your hair now and then.

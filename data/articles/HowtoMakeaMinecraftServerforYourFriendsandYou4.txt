 Once the server has run for the first time, exit out. Open the ops.txt file in the Minecraft Server directory. Add your username to this file to give yourself administrator privileges. This will let you kick and ban players from in the game, as well as adjust other settings.
 Add your friends’ Minecraft usernames to the white-list.txt file in the Minecraft Server directory. Only the usernames listed in this text file will be able to connect to your server. This will keep random people from griefing your game.
 Type “my ip address” into Google and your external (public) IP address will be displayed as the first result. Have your users type in your external IP address on the Minecraft multiplayer menu.


If your internet service provider assigns you a dynamic IP address, check the Dynamic DNS section below for a guide to setting up a Dynamic DNS that will stay constant even if your IP address changes.
 Give your server’s IP or host name to your friends. They will need to enter the IP address or host name of your server in the Multiplayer menu of Minecraft.


Players connecting on a local network need to enter the local IP; those connecting from the internet need to enter your external IP or host name.

 Stand at fan height and look down each blade. Do any look warped, cracked, or bent? Check the blade holders, the metal pieces at the base of each blade, and check for any cracks or wear. If you have broken or warped blades or blade holders you should contact your fan's manufacturer for a replacement., Hold the yardstick up to the ceiling and spin the fan so that the outside edge of a blade lines up with the yardstick. Note the height of the blade, and then check the other blades to make sure they are the same. Keep the yardstick in place the entire time, spinning the fan to make sure all the blades meet the yardstick at the same height.Since fans blades are usually tilted, make sure you measure from the same edge on every blade -- the highest corner is usually the easiest to mark.
If you don't have a yardstick, a board or piece of paper should work too. Use a permanent marker to note the height of each blade, keeping your measurement instrument in the same place while spinning the blades., this screw may be covered up or hard to reach, but it is found where the blade hanger (metal piece attaching the wooden blade to the fan) meets the motor. Get in and tighten this screw, which should raise the fan.
 Do not do this if a blade holder is cracked, as it could cause it to break. However, light pressure can be used to bend the blade to the right height. Hold onto the base of the fan with one hand, keeping it still. Put gentle upward or downward pressure on the blade holder at the point where it meets the blade to align it correctly.Check the height of the blades one more time to make sure everything is well aligned. Remember to use your yardstick and spin the blades instead of moving the measuring stick.
 If the wobble is gone, it should stay that way unless someone accidentally clips a blade. A vertical variance of even 1/8" in one blade can cause it to wobble, so make sure you get this right before moving on to fan balancing.

 Less multi-colored-ness in the hair and tease it less. It should be a natural color with one or two neon highlights or a natural color with blond, red, or black highlights (blond if you are brunette, black if you are blond, red if you are a redhead). Or, just leave it plain and natural.
 Don't wear multicolored jeans too often, only wear dark wash, black, and white jeans, with colorful jeans occasionally. Don't wear tutus too often, don't really wear skirts or dresses. Also, don't wear ripped jeans.
 The should preferably be tight fitting or slightly loose. Wear them in pastel and bright colors, like pale and bright pink, blue, green, purple, black, white, yellow and orange. Make sure to layer graphic T's underneath your polo shirts. For the shirts, the necessary colors are pink, white, black, green, and purple. Red is also good.
 The hoodies can either be loose and long or tight and long. Your cardigans should be tailored and only worn over very scene shirts. Same with sweaters.
 Also, cartoon characters are great. Have at least 2 scene necklaces, one preppy necklace, and a few charm bracelets with scene and preppy charms. Earrings can be anything. Hair accessories should be black, don't wear much else that is black when wearing black in your hair. Belts should be chunky.
 You should also have Converse sneakers, Vans, and one pair of topsiders (worn occasionally).

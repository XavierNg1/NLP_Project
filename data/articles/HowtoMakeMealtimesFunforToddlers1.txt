 Let the child choose a meal to eat. Offer options that you can make from selected foods and let him choose what he wants to eat or how to prepare the food you've chosen. Set limits on time and offer only two choices.;
, Let your child help with choosing the food in the grocery store. This can be a good opportunity to find out exactly what your toddler likes and to teach them the names of different foods.
 Involve your toddler in the preparation of food. Give your child an apron and chef hat and call them your assistant. Let them hand you the food you need to wash or chop, allow them to mix ingredients or give them a piece of dough to knead. Children prefer to eat food that they created themselves.
 If you have the means, let your child help you to grow vegetables in your garden. Watering together and picking the fruits, vegetables and herbs together will help to get the child more invested in the food they are eating before you even begin to prepare it.
 Let your toddler put the plates and cutlery on the table. Provide the child with his own special cutlery, in a unique color or shape, or adorned with the child's favorite cartoon character.


Allowing the child to pick flowers for a centerpiece may also be helpful in making the meal feel “special”, which in turn will make your toddler feel more invested in the meal.

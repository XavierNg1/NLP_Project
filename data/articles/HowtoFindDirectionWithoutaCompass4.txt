 In order for this method to work, you must have an analog watch with hands that is set to the correct time. Verify that your watch is in proper working order, and both hands are moving as they should.You won’t be able to use this method if you have a digital watch because the analog watch’s hour hand is crucial to helping you find your direction.
 It’s best if the watch is also on a level surface. Try taking it off your wrist and placing it so it rests flat against the palm of your hand. You should be holding it in front of you as you would a compass.It’s often easier to hold the watch steady if you use your free hand to support the hand holding the watch from underneath.
 The procedure for finding your direction with the watch differs based on where you are in the world. If you are in the Northern Hemisphere, position the watch so the hour hand points at the sun. In the Southern Hemisphere, hold the watch so the “12” is pointed at the sun.In the Northern Hemisphere, look at where “12” is on your watch with the hour hand pointed at the sun. Find the halfway point between it and the hour hand -- that direction would be south, while the opposite direction would be north.
If you are in the Southern Hemisphere, look at where the hour hand is on your watch with the “12” pointed at the sun. Find the halfway point between it and the “12”-- that direction would be north, while the opposite would be south.
During daylight savings time, which occurs spring through early fall, your direction will be slightly off. To get the correct direction, adjust your watch’s hour hand earlier by one hour to get the most accurate results.

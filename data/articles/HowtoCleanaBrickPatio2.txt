 If you are giving your brick patio a basic cleaning, you can use plain water to wash it. If there is a buildup of mildew, grime, or other residue, add detergent to the machine. Apply a gentle stream of soapy water to the patio using a low pressure nozzle, then let it sit for 5-10 minutes to penetrate dirt.Only use detergent that is specified for pressure washer use.
 Move and rinse the soap thoroughly to ensure that the patio gets a good cleaning. Always move the stream away from your home, and not towards it, to avoid pushing dirt and debris upwards towards your walls, doors, and windows. Spray in gentle, consistent strokes to avoid leaving stripe markings on the patio., If the brick patio still looks dirty after rinsing, repeat the process by applying more detergent and rinsing again. Continue until you are satisfied with the results. Allow the patio to air dry before putting furniture, plants, or other items back onto it., After the patio dries, you may notice a white powdery residue. This residue, called efflorescence, is normal and easily removed by scrubbing it with a cleaning brush. Do not attempt to remove the residue with the pressure washer, which will make the problem worse.

 Take a spare piece of paper and write some ideas or make a 'word web'.;
, Is it a story? Perhaps an article? Or a summary of a story? Always think first, then write.
 If you're writing a story, think of a good blurb. For example, a girl who has no friends or a guy who is sentenced to jail for a crime he didn't do, etc.
 There's no way you can be squished with hard books and gum wrappers, etc, and start writing.
 Look at your past English textbooks and find any extra adjectives or words in them that you can use for your story.
 You don't have to rush and write a story. Fit a time in your schedule where you can just relax and write in your pajamas in bed.
 Take one piece of paper, write something and check to see if its good or bad. If its bad, rub or scratch it out and rewrite something with the same story but in different words.
 Get a glass of water or better yet, a water bottle, and keep it on your bed-side table. If you feel that writer's block is coming at you, take a long, nice sip of the water and your brain will feel refreshed, as if you can think clearly again.
 You don't have to rub it out or throw it away to waste paper.
 Or find a family member who is very good at writing, (Example: Mom, brother, sister) and you can write together.
 Once your going to write something, be confident. Otherwise, how on earth are you going to get over writer's block?

, Just don't stop until you think that the story should come to an end.
 IE "Suddenly, purple penguins deleted the software the hero used to track the antagonist. Then, (name of protagonist) vanished the purple penguins forever from the earth." Do that until you have something else, and then go back and delete your random spree.
 Want to kill writer's block? Kill a character! Be sure to come up with an interesting excuse for it, and remember, you can always bring the character back.

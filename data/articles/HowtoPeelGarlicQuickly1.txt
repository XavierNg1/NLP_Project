 This trick is very fast once you get the hang of it, but it does not work with a single clove.Set a bulb of garlic on your counter with the tip of the shoots facing up. Strike the heel of your hand against the top of the bulb, and the cloves should separate easily.









If your hands are sensitive or the clove is particularly dry, hit a hard bowl against the top of the clove instead.
Set a few aside if you don't plan to use them all.;
, Cover the bowl with a lid or another, upside-down bowl. Alternatively, you can place your cloves inside an old, sturdy plastic bottle and screw the top tightly.









Small to medium bowls work best. The cloves need to bang against each other to shake off their skin.
 Make sure you hear the garlic slamming against the sides of the container.
 Pour out the garlic cloves and the skins. They should be fully peeled. If some of your cloves are only partially peeled, shake them for a few more seconds as hard as you can.

 Complacency occurs when a person is working from routine, not staying alert to the possible dangers. Building up a false sense of security and trust around activities, animals and tools is dangerous because the unknown can always happen in a moment and your reaction time depends on your staying alert. When an accident happens out of complacency, it is because a person has not been proactive about watching for certain signs that things aren't going as they should be., This can be a bit hard to do when you are one to work by yourself, but not so if you have someone you are living with to rely on to communicate this to. If you are alone, try texting or emailing a neighboring farmer and doing the same in return––create a buddy system of looking out for each other., You don't know how fast you are nor what your reaction time is until you've had something happen to you that tests it, sometimes with bad consequences. Always assume that you're underestimating the dangers, so as to overcompensate with care., This is especially important when handling potentially dangerous animals such as bulls or freshening cows., For example, protection is necessary when handling chemicals like pesticides, insecticides and fungicides. For the sake of respiratory health, cover your mouth and nose whenever dust or fine particles are likely to occur, such as when shoveling grain in a near-empty grain bin, raking over old crop stubble or cleaning out stalls of dried manure, etc., If you are feeling tired, stop what you're doing and go have a coffee break or a short nap. Fatigue tends to be the number one cause in farm accidents and farm accident fatalities and serious injuries. A nap is a good way to refresh and still get plenty of hours out of the day., Often it's better to listen to your gut instinct instead of your intellect. If you are second guessing yourself, chances are it's not worth the risk to take.

 After you have typed this in and pressed ↵ Enter, you'll be greeted with the "roaming" folder, which is where you will access the Minecraft directory.
 Select the folder named ".minecraft". Once within this folder, select the "screenshots" folder and you'll have found all of your screenshots.
 They will all be in the .png format. Once you locate the folder, consider creating a shortcut to your desktop for easier access.

 One of the most important parts of getting a little leeway from your teacher is to not insult their intelligence. You’re not the first student to forget homework and try to get out of it. Your teacher has probably heard a list of excuses longer than the number of years you’ve been alive, so don’t go with the first obvious or lame excuse that comes to your head. It probably won’t get you anywhere.It should be obvious, but don’t use “the dog ate my homework.” You might as well not even bother coming up with an excuse at all.
Don’t just say “I lost it” unless you can come up with a believable set of extenuating circumstances to explain how it got lost. Saying it just got lost randomly is pretty transparent.
 Saying your printer didn’t work or your computer froze is definitely a last-generation excuse. With the ubiquity of printers and cloud storage, saying technology mysteriously hijacked your homework is a pretty thin excuse.


Instead of blaming the printer or your laptop, etc., explain that you had trouble when you were trying to print (or whatever) the homework right before class but that you’ll email it to your teacher by the end of the day. You can buy more time with that, and quickly type it up.
Just be sure you actually do send it to them by the end of the day--preferably by 5 pm., Saying you didn’t know it was due or weren’t in class when it was assigned won’t work, for three big reasons.


First, since it’s your responsibility, not theirs, to make sure you’re up-to-date on assignments, this excuse is pretty much like telling the teacher that it was your own fault.
Second, because, from your teacher’s point of view, an entire classroom of other students managed to find out about and do the homework, so it clearly isn’t as hard as you’re making it out to be.And finally, the ignorance excuse won’t work because when you’re absent, your teacher expects that you’ll find out everything you missed. If didn’t, your teacher will again see it as your own fault.

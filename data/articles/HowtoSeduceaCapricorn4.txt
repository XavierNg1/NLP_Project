 Capricorns value tenderness in everything. Whether you are putting a point across or making love, be gentle.
 Capricorns are classy people and they like to see other people exhibiting the same. Behaving in a proper manner and having a good hygiene is a must.
 Girls, behave like a lady and boys, behave like a gentlemen. Sounds simple right? Use all those manners your grandmother taught you. Being crass will not help you get this particular person.
 Acting a little bit crazy in private may not be a deal-breaker, but do the same in public and you might have to go home alone. That means no getting too drunk or telling private stuff to strangers.

 Map their interests, find out all about their hobbies, learn about their cravings, and lifelong wishes that were never fulfilled. There is not one person on the world who doesn't enjoy doing something, so don't give up finding this activity.
 Create a document on your computer, and write down every new hint of an enjoyed hobby or relaxation method. Things like John likes fishing in the mountain rivers. Or Jane enjoys having a bubble bath with candles. Now you'll know that a gift for John that's related to fishing will be appreciated, like a book about good locations, or a magazine subscription. Jane loves a bubble bath with candles, so you can buy her candles or meditative music, an aromatherapy gift set, or incense sticks. Whatever suits her personality.
 Try making something yourself. A photo montage, a painting, a statue, a poem, or a calendar with pictures taken together.
 Or find objects that make them remember something beautiful.
, Create a numbered list of these items. Most enjoyed things come first, less liked but more useful come last. When you buy something for someone, make sure you make note not to buy the same gift again. This can be truly embarrassing.
 You can plan way ahead if you want. Presents related to their favorite activities and hobbies are better for birthdays, sentimental gifts are better for family occasions or anniversaries, relaxing gifts like a week in a spa, or skiing, are best for holidays like Christmas.
, If you don't pay attention to the looks, the contents will not mean that much. You can ask for gift wrapping in most stores.
 Customizing the wrapping, or writing a cool gift card is not optional!

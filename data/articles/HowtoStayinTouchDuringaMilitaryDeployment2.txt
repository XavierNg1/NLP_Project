 Mail a letter as soon as they arrive to their official station. Have them notify you as soon as they get the first or initial letter so you both know how long it takes for mail to deliver.
 There is nothing more like a handwritten note when separations occur.
 Freewrite your letters like how you would draw a verbal conversation with them.
 Have them draw pictures of anything, including their family member overseas, the weather outside, how they're feeling, etc.
 Even a simple, "I love you" goes a long way to encourage moral and boost self esteem.
 Before sending them off, number your letters (such as "1", "2", etc) not just the current date. Letters may be delayed or arrive faster than others.
 Play this game to keep your family connected with countdown dates.


Print out at least two to three months worth in calendar form. Fold each paper in thirds, if necessary, to fit a business envelope.
Mark off day one and mail it immediately.
Have the deployed family member "tag" the day they receive the calendar and mail it immediately.
Continue tagging dates back and forth.
Keep the game updated as time goes on by storing the old months and inputting new and current papers in.
 Maintain the packages around the deployed person's "wish list", such as magazines, bathroom essentials (toothpaste or hand sanitizer), etc.


Add anything in the box that you cannot fit into a standard letter envelope.
It is very important to know what is allowed and restricted in packages.

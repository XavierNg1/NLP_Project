 Go over your daily or weekly schedule and decide when you’ll connect with your family and catch up with friends. If you’re busy, you may find it helpful to incorporate social time into your ordinary routines.


For example, you could catch up with your family every day over dinner., It’s all too easy to waste your evening free time on gadgets like your phone or tablet, and using electronics close to bedtime can actually prevent you from getting a good night’s rest. Save time and sleep better by turning off your gadgets at least an hour before bed., Personal time is important to your overall health and happiness, so prioritize it just like you would work or school. Think about what you need to feel refreshed and recharged every day. Then block off time for it in your planner.For instance, you could get up twenty minutes earlier every morning to meditate, or you could set aside Sunday evenings to work on a hobby.
 Give yourself at least seven hours to sleep every night, as well as a few hours a week to exercise and prepare nutritious food. Staying healthy helps you function better in every area of life. You’ll also enjoy a better quality of life years down the road if you take care of your health now.

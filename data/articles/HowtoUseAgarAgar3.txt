 Agar expands in your stomach, which tricks you into thinking you are full. It's know as the "kanten diet" in Japan and is used by many to try and prevent them from eating too much.People with type 2 Diabetes who supplemented their diet with Agar lost a significant amount of weight and improved their metabolism.It may also help stabilize blood sugar levels.Make sure you check with your doctor before embarking on this diet.
Make snacks using Agar to stay full throughout the day, or mix it into your meals so you stop eating sooner than you normally would.
Be aware that Agar can also stimulate your intestines and make you need to use the bathroom.Make sure you take Agar with at least 8 oz. of water, otherwise the Agar can swell and possibly block your esophagus or intestines., Agar is 80% fiber, so it can be helpful if you need to relieve constipation. It should never, however, be used when you have a bowel obstruction (a kink or blockage in your intestines that prevents you from passing gas or having a bowel movement), as this can make the obstruction much worse.If you have sudden, severe pain in your abdomen, swelling in your abdomen, and vomit or become nauseous, do not take Agar. Call your doctor instead, as you may have a bowel obstruction.Make sure you take Agar with enough water, at least 8oz, for it to work as a laxative.

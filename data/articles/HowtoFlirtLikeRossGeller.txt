 Also make sure the woman don't get that you were trying to compliment her. Here is an example:


(This one is the original one by Ross Geller in the Friends episode where he flirts) "I happen to like eight year old boys" (he is referring to a previous event in the episode where the woman he is flirting with said her haircut looked like that of an eight year old boy. Of course this woman don't remember this and she gets a quite different idea) Once Ross realises what he has said he must try to make it sound right again which brings us to step two.;
, Since you are trying to imitate Ross you must make sure you mess it up real bad and make it even worse. This might be easier if you plan what to say beforehand.
 Make sure this backfires. Here is Ross' example from the Friends episode:


Ross asks the pizza lady if they make the pizzas in wood-burning ovens, and she replies that they use gas ovens. Ross then asks her if she knows "that smell gas has" and he goes on and on about how they add the smell to gas.
 In the episode, once the pizza lady left he closed the door and said: "Did I just talk to her about gas?" and he realised what he had done.

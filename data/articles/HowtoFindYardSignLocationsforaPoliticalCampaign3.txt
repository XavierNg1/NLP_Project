 Distribute yard sign cards or extra signs at every public event hosted by your campaign, as well as at local events such as festivals or rallies. If you donâ€™t have extra yard signs at the moment, actively encourage people to fill the cards out and give them to you or a volunteer before they leave.


Allowing people to take yard signs at your events helps you get coverage in areas you may not be actively canvassing in, and for many voters is easier than signing up and waiting for signs to be distributed.
 Engage local voters with an event such as a block party, and distribute and raise signs during this time. This not only allows for sign distribution, but also gives your campaign a chance to court voters face-to-face.


If you host an event meant to promote yard signs, use it as a chance to show voter appreciation, as well. Voters are more likely to turn up for an actively engaging event such as a block party than an event focused completely on the signs.
 You want your signs to be put up and stay up, but signs often manage to go missing. Have a volunteer or a team check areas where you know your campaign has heavy sign coverage, and place new signs where old ones may have gone missing.


Always be sure to ask permission before replacing a sign on private property, as the voter may have willingly gotten rid of the sign at some point.

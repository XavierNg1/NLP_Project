 The IRS distinguishes clearly between business and non-business types of bad debt. Business bad debt is a worthless (uncollectible) debt that was created or acquired during the course of business. This might includes loans or credit sales to customers or vendors, or business loan guarantees. Nonbusiness bad debts are defined more broadly as all other bad debts (not related to business).


To be a bad debt, the debt must be considered "worthless." That is, reasonable efforts must have been made to collect the debt. A debt is considered a bad debt when, even after attempting collection, there is no expectation that the debt will be repaid.Business debt allows for partial deductions, whereas non-business debt requires a deduction of the entire debt amount.;
, The debt agreement should clearly lay out the terms of the debt and repayment. This might include a schedule, payment amount, interest rate, fees, and other details. Check the agreement again to be sure that the debtor is in violation of its terms. Debts without a signed agreement will be more difficult or impossible to collect, as it may seem that they are a gift., Specify the type of breach, whether it is low payment, no payment, or late payment. Then, identify the steps taken to remedy breach. These step may be laid out in a debt collection policy on the lender's side. For example, a lender might work with the debtor to accept a payment gap or create a payment plan., Document any attempts to collect on the debt. Specifically, write down who was spoken to over the phone and what was discussed. In addition, keep copies of any letters sent or received between the lender and debtor. These "demand letters" can be used when proving collection efforts in court.

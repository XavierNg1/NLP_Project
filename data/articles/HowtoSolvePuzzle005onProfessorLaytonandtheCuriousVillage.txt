 To make it easier for yourself, either do the morning (midnight to noon) or afternoon/evening (noon to midnight) and then double the number for the entire day.;
, When we see a digital clock, we automatically think of "1:11 pm" or "4:44 am". Here would be the potential list:


1:11
2:22
3:33
4:44
5:55

, Learn that the minutes will still be the same during the 11 and 12 o' clock hours and you'd still have the same 3 consecutive numbers.


11:11
12:22

, Because you have "1" as your consecutive number, use this to your advantage and go up in minutes.


11:10
11:12
11:13
11:14
11:15
11:16
11:17
11:18
11:19

, Note that "10:00" is the only hour with 3 consecutive zeros.
 You should end up with 34 to write on the next screen.

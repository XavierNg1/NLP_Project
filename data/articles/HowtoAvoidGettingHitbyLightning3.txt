 When your choice is either outdoors or inside a car, your car is always the safest option. If caught in a thunderstorm, remain inside your car until the storm passes. Close your windows, and put the top up in your convertible.

Open vehicles, like golf carts, ATVs, and riding mowers, are not safe during lightning storms. Seek shelter indoors.
Convertibles are less safe than other cars in thunderstorms. If possible, avoid driving them when it's raining.
Starting your car is generally safe during a thunderstorm, but do not under any circumstances jump your car until the storm has passed.
 Most cars are safe from lightning, but the metal exterior or any metal objects are not safe to touch. If lightning strikes your car, the current will flow from the car's outer metal cage and into the ground below. Keep your hands in your lap and avoid leaning on the car doors or touching any exposed metal.

Rubber tires will not protect your car from getting struck., Some portions of the current can travel through the wired areas in your car. Don't touch any of the vehicle's electrical systems during the car, including your radio, GPS system, or cell phone charger.

In some cases, lightning strikes can damage your car's electric systems. Avoid driving your car during thunderstorms if you have expensive radio or GPS systems installed.
 If driving in an outage area, pull over and turn on your hazard lights. Areas with outages are dangerous to drive in, especially if the traffic lights have shorted out. If you must continue traveling, treat intersections with shorted traffic signals as a four-way stop and take extra caution.

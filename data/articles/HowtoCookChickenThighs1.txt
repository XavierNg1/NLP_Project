Alternatively, line the baking dish with nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper instead of spraying it with cooking spray.;
, Sprinkle it with salt and pepper, to taste, and drizzle the olive oil over it.


You can season the chicken directly in the baking dish to minimize the number of dishes you dirty. Alternatively, you can do so on a separate plate or in a bowl to reduce the amount of mess in the baking dish.
If you are unsure of how much salt and pepper to use, start with roughly 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt and 1/8 tsp (0.625 ml) black pepper.
Use a basting brush to brush the olive oil over the chicken for a more thorough coating. The oil helps the chicken to stay moist and to brown in the oven. Melted butter or another type of vegetable oil will also work.
If desired, you could also use a baking sauce instead of oil. Brush a homemade or commercial sauce, like a barbecue sauce, over the chicken thighs using a basting brush.
 The chicken should be browned on top and have an internal temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius).


Use an instant-read meat thermometer to check the internal temperature. Stick it into the center of the thickest thigh to get an accurate reading.
If the chicken thighs are not done, return to the oven and continue cooking in five minute increments until the correct internal temperature is reached.
 Remove the chicken after it finishes cooking and let it rest, covered, for 10 minutes.


Cover the pan with aluminum foil. You do not need to create a tight seal, however. The foil can simply rest on top.
Allowing the chicken to rest makes it more tender and ensures that it is cool enough to eat comfortably.

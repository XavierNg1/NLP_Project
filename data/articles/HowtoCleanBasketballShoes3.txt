 In most cases, the maker of your basketball shoes will recommend that you not put them in either a washing machine or a clothes dryer. It is particularly wise to heed this advice if your shoes are expensive or otherwise valuable to you.In reality, your shoes will probably make it through a wash cycle just fine. However, only you can decide if you’re willing to take the risk that “probably” entails.
 Use the cool or cold water setting. Add a few old towels to reduce clanging around (and potential shoe damage) during the spin cycle. Add less detergent than you normally would, if possible.Remove insoles and shoestrings before starting the wash. You can wash them along with the shoes.
 Even if you do choose to use the washer, it’s best to avoid the dryer if you can. Place some newspaper inside the shoes and stick them in an airy, sunny spot if possible., If your shoes are filthy and you’re just not all that worried about whether they’ll emerge unscathed, you can try adjusting the washing machine to the warm or hot water settings. Set it to a regular wash cycle, but keep it on a low spin setting. Once again, throw in a few old towels to reduce banging around.Since you’re being a risk-taker anyway, go ahead and throw the shoes in the dryer afterward as well. But don’t get too wild — put the dryer on its low heat setting.

 Real pearls have depth and luster. Fake pearls do not reflect light as well. The fake pearls may look shiny, but they will appear shallow. Take the pearls to a well-lit room or shine a flashlight on them. They are most likely real if they reflect the light well., A real pearl has onion-skin-type layers inside of it. If the pearl has a hole from where it has been drilled, use a flashlight and 10x loupe and shine it inside of the hole. Look for the layers. If it is fake, there won’t be any layers at all.You can also use a regular magnifying glass.
 If you’re having trouble identifying the pearls on your own, a sure way to identify them is to have them x-rayed. An x-ray will show if the pearls has the onion-like layers that it should have. Although it may be a strange request, you can ask your personal physician, veterinarian, or dentist to do the x-ray for a fee.The x-ray will also identify if the pearl is natural or cultured. A an x-ray will reveal a bead inside of a coating.

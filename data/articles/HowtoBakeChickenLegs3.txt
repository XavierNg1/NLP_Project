 To make sure that your oven is hot and ready to bake the chicken, start preheating it when you are ready to start seasoning the chicken.
 Remove the legs from the package and wash them thoroughly under cool, running water. Remove dangling pieces of fat or skin.


After you have washed the meat, dry the meat with paper towels. This will help the flavors cling to the meat, and allow the skin to get crispy when cooked.
Set the meat on a plate until you are ready to move on to the next step.
 Place the flour in a shallow pan. Combine the eggs and milk in a separate pan. Combine the rosemary, garlic, breadcrumbs, and salt and pepper in a third shallow pan.
 Using a pair of tongs, coat each piece of chicken, one at a time. First coat each piece in the flour, then the egg mixture, and then the rosemary garlic mixture. Place the coated pieces of chicken in a glass or metal baking pan coated in olive oil.
 The chicken is finished when it's sizzling and crispy, or when its internal temperature reaches 180 degrees. Use a meat thermometer to check the temperature., Serve with french green beans and wild rice, or the side dishes of your choice.

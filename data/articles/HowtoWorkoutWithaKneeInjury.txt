 As soon as the knee injury occurs (for an acute injury) or becomes apparent (for a chronic injury), follow the RICER rule: "Rest" it, "Ice" it, "Compress" it with bandages, "Elevate" it and get a "Referral" from your doctor to visit a specialist.;
, Injuries often produce scar tissue, which can hamper movement and become painful if not treated. See a physiotherapist or sports massage therapist for treatment such as ultrasound and heat therapy, as well as massage therapy.
 You need to enhance the circulation in your legs to increase the blood flow, so nutrients can get to the injured area and waste products can be removed. You should focus on regaining your range of motion, as well as your strength and power, endurance, balance and proprioception.


Start with simple leg bending and straightening exercises, followed by gentle rotations of the legs.
After 14 to 21 days, depending on your progress, build up to slightly more intense leg stretching exercises and isometric exercises, such as pressing the ankle or the foot against a wall.
When you're ready for more strenuous exercises, use the weight machines at a gym to strengthen your legs. The leg curl machines and leg extension machines are an excellent way to build the strength in the muscles surrounding your knees.
Work with a certified personal trainer to do exercises with free weights.



You can use balance disks, balance trainers and Swiss Balls. You can also start with the training drills used in your sport such as light sprints and jumps.

 Currently, Gmail's mobile interface does not allow you to access settings, so you will need to log in from a computer to enable this feature.
 It will be located next to your Gmail address in bold text to the left, and "Help" and "Sign Out" to the right. Click on it., The default timing for delaying the sending of an email is 10 seconds. If you want to change this time, you can shift it to 5, 20, or 30 seconds.

Go to "Settings", "General" tab and find the "Undo Send" section and change the duration under the drop-down menu box.
 Use an alternate email address and write yourself a short message. Send it.


Undo Send works with any email program. Having the Undo Send feature turned on delays the actual message send for up to 30 seconds, it does not take back a message you sent. As a result, any email address you send an email to can be undone.
 There will be a yellow message box alerting you that your message has been sent, and giving you the option to click "Undo" or "View Message". Click Undo to cancel the sending of the email.
 There will be a small yellow box at the top reading "Sending has been undone." After you have clicked "Undo", you will be directed to the unsent message. Here, you can edit the message and email address(es) you were sending it to, or discard the whole email.

Check the alternate email inbox to ensure that the message did not send.

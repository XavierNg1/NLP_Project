 In a medium saucepan, combine ½ cup (100 g) of sugar with a ⅓ cup (79 ml) of water. Set the pan on a burner and turn to the heat to medium-low heat. Stir occasionally to dissolve the sugar.Usually simple syrup is equal parts sugar and water. Using less water here, however, will make your topping less runny.
 Once all of the sugar in your syrup has dissolved, turn the heat up to medium-high. Pour 2 cups (200 g) of cranberries into the syrup once it reaches a boil. Boil them for roughly five minutes, or until about half of them have burst open, then remove from heat.Once you remove them from heat, stir in ½ cup (160 g) of currant jelly.
Continue to stir until the jelly melts and combines with the syrup.
 Give your topping time to cool off until it reaches room temperature. This size batch should top a whole pie or cake with eight to ten servings. If this is what you are using it for, spoon it over the pie/cake and then place the whole thing in the refrigerator. Give the topping a half-hour or more to chill and set so it’s less runny.Alternately, you could also transfer it to a sealable container and use it for toast, muffins, cornbread, or whatever sounds tempting.

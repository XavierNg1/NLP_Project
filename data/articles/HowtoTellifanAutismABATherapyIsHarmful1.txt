 The UN states that disabled children have a right to preservation of identity,i.e., to be themselves even if it means looking autistic. A good therapist will allow them to look different, and therapy will not center on removing characteristics such as...



Most stimming(You may hear phrases such as "quiet hands" and "table ready" to indicate suppression of stims.)
Toe-walking

Avoidance of eye contactDesire not to have a wide circle of friends
Other quirks (Fitting in should be a personal choice, not forced by others.);
, Some therapists train autistic people to show facial expressions or body language that suggest happiness, regardless of their actual feelings.No one should be pushed to smile or act happy if they do not feel happy.
Hugs and kisses should not be trained or pressured, even if it means hurting feelings. The right to set boundaries is important in arming your loved one against sexual and emotional abuse., Good therapy goals might include...


Finding comfortable and non-harmful stims, instead of extinguishing all stimming
Finding ways to accommodate and alleviate sensory issues
Gaining social skills in a friendly environment; these include assertiveness as well as making friends
Discussing and meeting your loved one's own personal goals

, Communication should be considered more important than verbal speech (including both behavior and AAC).Beginning vocabulary should focus on basic needs instead of parents' feelings.


Words such as "yes," "no," "stop," "hungry," and "hurt" are more necessary than "I love you" or "Mommy."
Behavior should be respected, even as someone is learning to communicate via AAC or speech.

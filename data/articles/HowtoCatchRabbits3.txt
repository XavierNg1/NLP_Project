 Some people use wire noose snares to catch rabbits because they are not very costly. One problem with a snare is that you will have to handle the rabbit to release it after catching it.


Rabbits can bite, so make sure you wear tough, impenetrable gloves before handling a wild rabbit.Before releasing a rabbit, you should check with laws and regulations in your area. Sometimes this won’t be allowed. In that case, contact a local humane society after catching the rabbit. Remember that rabbits can carry fleas and ticks, so handle them as little as possible.
 This is hard but possible. You will need to corner the rabbit so that it can’t run into the woods or other areas that are hard for you to reach. It helps if you get the rabbit used to you over days time.


Don’t look directly at a rabbit. The rabbit may perceive this as a predatory gaze. Believe it or not, but talking to the rabbit may calm it down.Rabbits are likely to come forward a bit to explore, especially if you have treats in your hands, like carrots, banana, or alfalfa hay. Be patient.
 You could catch the rabbit with a bat net with very fine mesh. Set the net down, and let the rabbit come close to you before scooping the rabbit up in the net.


Or you could scoop the rabbit into a pet carrier when it approaches you. Choose a carrier for a small or medium-sized pet.
Another method involves setting up a three-foot exercise or puppy pen in a semi-circle formation. You will probably need another person to do this. Once you spot the rabbit, set up the semi-circle, and then pen the rabbit inside. Then, coax the rabbit into the pet carrier.

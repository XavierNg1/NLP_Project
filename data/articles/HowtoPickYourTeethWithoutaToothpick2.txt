 If you don't have floss, you can use a piece of thread as a substitute. It will basically do the same job but will be less strong and is more liable to get stuck or break. One good thing about thread is that it's not hard to find. You might be able to tease out a short length of thread from whatever you are wearing to use as makeshift floss.


Wrap the ends around your index fingers as you would with floss and work it through your teeth. Take extra care because it doesn't take much to break it.
 If you don't have any toothpicks, floss or an interdental brush, it's time to start looking around for things with a flattened point that are not sharp and which you can safely put in your mouth. There are number of options that can work if you are lucky. Try folding over a piece of paper and using this as a makeshift toothpick, or alternatively try using a business card.


A drinking straw can be manipulated to fit between your teeth and dislodge and bit of food, but be careful. There is a danger that you could get whatever you use as a toothpick stuck between your teeth.
Be sure only to use something that is disposable and not important.
 If all else fails and you have long finger nails, you can try to work out some stuck food by sliding a finger nail down the side of the affected tooth. If you do this be sure to slide down from just below the gum line if the food is stuck in the upper layer of teeth. If the food is stuck in one of your bottom layer teeth slide your nail upwards away from the gum line.


Doing this will ensure that you are not moving your nail towards your gums which could result in your finger slipping and you cutting the gum.
Be sure to wash your hands before and after doing this.
Because of the risk of damaging gums, many dentists don't recommend the use of toothpicks at all.

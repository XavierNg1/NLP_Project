 Look for a scale that is sturdy and accurate. There should be a tray or indentation in which your baby can lay safely. Additionally, there should be no sharp or rough parts that could hurt your baby. Look for a scale that can hold up to 40 lbs (approximately 18 kg).Make sure the scale can read differences of as little as 10 grams.Scales are available for purchase online for around $50.
Baby scales can be digital, colorful, utilitarian, and can include accessories like a length measuring arm.
In some regions, you can rent a baby scale. This is a practical option for people with budget or space limitations.;
, Whether a digital or analog scale, be sure the reading is 0 when there is nothing on it. If you plan to put the baby on top of a blanket, you can null this weight on a digital scale. To do so, first place the blanket on the scale. Once its weight registers, press the tare key. This will void that weight.
 Set the baby on the scale, preferably naked. Keep one hand hovering over, but not on, the baby’s chest. You want to be able to catch the baby if he slips. Read his weight. Record the baby’s weight in a notebook. Keep track of weight gain or loss. As weight fluctuation happens often, it is best to weigh your baby every two weeks to measure longer term gains or losses.Don't worry too much about short-term weight gains or losses, unless your child seems ill or is having feeding problems. In that case, check with your doctor.
If the weather is too cold, weigh your child’s clothes separately and then dress your child for the weigh-in. Subtract the weight of the clothes from the weight shown on the scale.
Set the scale on a sturdy, flat surface. Your dining room table would work as would a wood or linoleum floor.

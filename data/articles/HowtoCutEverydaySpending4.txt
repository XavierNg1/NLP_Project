 Your mood when you shop can adversely affect your purchasing decisions. People tend to buy items they don't need when they're hungry. Avoid grocery shopping on an empty stomach.If you have a tendency to stress eat, you may also be tempted to buy unneeded items if you're shopping while upset or stressed out. Try to grocery shop when you're in a positive mood overall.
 Some items are cheaper when purchased in bulk. When you shop, be on the lookout for sales on bulk items. If, for example, if paper towel is $1.25 per roll or 10 for $5, you can save a lot of money buying paper towel for your home in bulk.Make sure to account for how long an item lasts when buying it in bulk. If you live alone, for example, it may not make sense to buy perishable items in bulk. Go for non-perishables, like canned foods and household supplies.
 Thrift stores often sell useful products, like clothing and household supplies, secondhand. Make a habit of stopping by a thrift store first when you're in need of something like a new shirt, jacket, or bookshelf. You may find an item in decent condition secondhand that's cheaper., When shopping, always make a list first. Write down the items you need and only buy items off that list. This will cut back on the temptation to impulse buy things you don't really need., Make a habit of saving any coupons you receive and clipping coupons out of your local newspaper. Scan the newspaper for coupons for items you buy regularly. You will be surprised how quickly savings add up when you're making use of coupons.You can also find coupons online, especially if you sign up for e-mail subscriptions at your favorite stores.
 Oftentimes, generic products are made with the same basic ingredients as name brand products. When selecting something like peanut butter, for example, read the ingredients and nutritional information for both name brand and generic varieties. If there is no significant difference, go for the generic product.

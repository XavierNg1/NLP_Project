If you take your eyes off it for anything other than a quick glance at the goalposts or your players, you might lose sight of it. This can lead to a ball slipping past you easily.



Are they playing offensive or defensive?
You can tell what way they're playing by watching how they move around. Are they constantly tackling and doing whatever they can to score a goal? Or do they have 4 defenders that are constantly trying to stop your team scoring? Some things are more subtler, like the other team's positioning.
If they're playing offensive, then you need to stay alert. Goalkeepers can be not really alert when the opposing team is scoring, if they're fast enough.
If they're playing defensive, be more alert about how your team is positioned. It's better to not have to make a save at all by having your defenders in the right position, especially with a defensive opposition, than having to make a save every minute or so.



They might be constantly crossing to each other, or just staying close and weaving the ball through your players.
Watch how they move around, kick the ball, pass it.
Do they have any specialties? Do they have a big kick, or do they trick their way around players? Things like this can really help.

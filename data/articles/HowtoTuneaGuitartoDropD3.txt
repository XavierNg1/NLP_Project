 Now that your sixth string is tuned to low D, the range of your guitar is slightly greater. You have two new notes at your disposal: low D, played by strumming the sixth string in the open position, and Eb, played at the first fret of the sixth string. Being able to play these new low notes opens up several exciting possibilities for your playing.


The most obvious of these is perhaps the fact that you can now play chords and scales with a root note of low D or Eb. This is especially useful for songs that rely heavily on these chords.
Another less obvious benefit is that you now have new bass notes for finger-picking playing styles (which are commonly used in folk music). This gives you the opportunity to use these low notes as bass tones, pedal tones, and so on. It's even possible to use the low D note as a drone note., One of the biggest advantages of Drop D tuning is that it can make power chords on the thickest strings very easy to play. Specifically, because the sixth string is a whole step lower than in standard tuning, a power chord is played in the same fret for all three lower-pitched strings. This means that, rather than requiring three fingers to play, power chords can be played with just a single finger. Simply lay your finger across the D, A, and D strings similar to how you would barre a chord to fret a power chord in Drop D.

It's worth noting that Drop D also makes it easier to switch between power chords quickly. This is used to great effect in hard rock and metal music — some songs would be very difficult or impossible to play in anything but Drop D.
 Below is a short selection of songs that use Drop D tuning — some are easy, some are hard, but all of them should have tabs readily available online to help you learn them:"Dear Prudence" by The Beatles
"Everlong" by The Foo Fighters
"Moby Dick" by Led Zeppelin
"Never Going Back Again" by Fleetwood Mac
"Blackhole Sun" by Soundgarden

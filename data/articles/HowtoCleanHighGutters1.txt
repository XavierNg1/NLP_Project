 Cleaning gutters can be dirty work. Additionally, gutters can be quite sharp. For these reasons, wear work clothes that you wonâ€™t mind getting stained and durable rubber gloves.Even in hot weather, wear a long sleeve shirt while cleaning. This will provide additional protection from insects and from the sharp edges of gutters.When cleaning gutters on dry days, especially in dusty areas, wear a face mask to prevent dust and pollen from aggravating your lungs.;
, Position the ladder where you plan to begin cleaning. Lean the ladder against the wall of your house, if possible. Otherwise, lean the ladder on the gutter where it is attached to the house with a fastener, like a nail.Before climbing your ladder, test it for stability by carefully climbing a step or two. If the ladder leans or wobbles, reposition it until it is sturdy.
If the ground is soft, the ladder may dangerously sink. Place same-sized pieces of scrap wood under the feet of your ladder to prevent sinking, then test the ladder again for stability. Reposition the ladder as needed.
Uneven or sloping ground may cause your ladder to lean. Level out the ladder by putting pieces of scrap wood underneath the leg on the leaning side of the ladder. Test the ladder for stability and make any necessary adjustments.
 Straighten the body of a wire coat hanger but leave the hooked end as is. This should form a straight piece of metal ending in a hook. Bend the hook-opposite end around the handle of your bucket. Hang the bucket from the second rung from the top.


Most of the debris in your gutters will be biodegradable. Should you desire to do so, debris can be thrown on the ground and left to decompose or composted.
If more convenient, place a large garbage can, tarp, or wheelbarrow beside your ladder. Throw cleared debris in/on these receptacles.
A plastic bag will work in a pinch as a substitute, but these can be awkward and dangerous to manage, especially if there is wind.

 If you want healthier chips leave the skin on and clean well.


An average-sized potato yields about 10 to 15 chips, although amounts vary based on the size of the potato and how thinly you slice it.
Idaho potatoes are recommended for chips, but you can use any variety you have on hand.;
,


A mandolin slicer can be used for a thin, even cut and added convenience.



Recommended oils include canola, rice and vegetable since they have little flavor and do not alter the taste of the potatoes. Canola oil is the healthiest of these options, since it is low in saturated fat and high in heart-healthy omega-3 fat.
 Shake off excess water, and pat the potato slices dry with paper towels.
 Remove the slices from the oil with a slotted spoon, and place them on a platter lined with paper towels.


Do not crowd the potato slices. Cook them in multiple batches with each batch composed of a single layer at the surface of the oil.
, Pat chips lightly with additional paper towels to absorb excess oil.



Depending on your tastes, you can combine plain salt with garlic powder, cayenne pepper, onion powder, dry mustard, dill or other seasoning mixes.

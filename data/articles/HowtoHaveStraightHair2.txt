 Just like with blow-drying, improper flat ironing can cause more harm than good. When picking a flat iron, choose heating plates that are smooth and won't catch or pull hair. Also consider the width of the iron. A slimmer iron allows for more precision, while a wider iron is better for a quick, all-over style. Thicker, longer hair may need a wider flat iron to cover more area over a shorter period of time. Think vice versa for shorter hair; your short hair needs a slimmer iron for more precision.


For fine, thin hair use straightening iron with lower temperatures. If your hair is fragile you must be careful of excessive burning.
 If four sections feel unmanageable, try more smaller sections. Starting with one section, brush out any knots or tangles.


When your flat-iron is completely heated up, the digital temperature reading will become stable. If your iron doesn't have a digital reading, it will often have a light that becomes solid in color when completely heated.
Be careful not to burn yourself or your surroundings with your straightening iron. With exceedingly high temperatures, fires can be a real hazard.
 Don't allow your flat iron to linger on a section too long. When using your iron, keep your hand steady and pull evenly down the length of your hair. Starting with smaller sections allows for more control and even straightening.


Use a balm or oil to control frizz. Apply a small amount to your hands and rub through your hair before, during, or after you use your flat iron. The oil weighs down hair and proteins within it will keep hair protected and strong.
If your hair isn't straight with the first iron, try brushing and ironing immediately following the first pass. The brushing motion will help keep hairs straight and organized, allowing the flat iron to be as efficient as possible.

 Log into Tumblr and navigate to the specific blog you wish to comment to privately.


If you are currently logged out of Tumblr or do not have an account, you might be able to use this feature as long as the user allows anonymous questions. This method is more likely to work if you create and log into your Tumblr account first, though.
As with the public reply feature, private comments only work if the user enables them on his or her blog.
 If the Tumblr user has either of these features enabled on his or her blog, you should see the relevant icon in the upper right corner of the page. The Fan Mail icon looks like a small envelop, while the Ask icon is merely a small button labeled “Ask me.” Click on either icon to be redirected to the related page.


Both features are very similar to one another, but fan mail has a slightly larger character limit, cannot be posted anonymously, and remains private. Questions, on the other hand, can be directed to the Tumblr user anonymously or with your Tumblr username attached, and the question can be made public if the receiver chooses to answer it publicly.
 Click your cursor in the text box, if necessary, and begin typing your message.


You may also be able to customize your note by choosing different background "paper" and a different font from several pre-selected options.
 When you're satisfied with the comment you wrote, click on the “Send” button to privately submit it to the user who runs the associated Tumblr blog.


The Tumblr user you send a comment to should be able to reply back to you privately regardless of whether you submitted it as fan mail or as a question.

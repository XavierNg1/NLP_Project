 Altmer are the best choice for a Sorcerer, having natural bonuses that are almost entirely devoted to creating an impressive magicka pool. They also get a bonus to the Destruction Staff, which makes them doubly dangerous as a Sorcerer.Altmer are available to those in the Aldmeri Dominion.;
, Bretons are the other race with a natural gift for magic, boasting a healthy mix of magicka and defense bonuses. These defense bonuses can be handy, as Sorcerers will have few points to spend on increasing health. Bretons are available to those in the Daggerfall Covenant.
 The Ebonheart Pact lacks good options for Sorcerers, but the Dunmer would be your best bet. They boast a slightly higher than normal magicka score, as well as a bonus to fire spells. As implied, Dunmer are available to those in the Ebonheart Pact.

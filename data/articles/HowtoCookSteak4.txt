 A cast-iron skillet is great at conducting heat, meaning that it spreads it out evenly over the entire surface.


Use a nice neutral oil to cook the steak in. Olive oil is great for pasta and eggplant, but not so great for cooking steaks. Canola or another vegetable oil is probably better.
, For best results, use a thermometer to check the internal temperature of the steak. Here's a guide of how internal temperature corresponds to doneness:


120° F (48.8° C) = Rare
130° F (54.4° C) = Medium rare
140° F (60° C) = Medium
150° F (65.5° C) = Medium well
160° F (71.1° C) = Well done

,, As you cook your meat, the juices travel to the inside of your meat as the muscle fibers contract. If you cut your steak right after you take it from the grill, the juices in the center fall out more freely. If you wait for at least five minutes, the muscle fibers relax and the juices spread out more evenly throughout the whole steak.
 Enjoy your wonderfully cooked steak alongside some German potato salad and brussel sprouts, for example.

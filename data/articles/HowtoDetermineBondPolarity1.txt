 Metals are typically shiny and malleable. They often have loosely bound electrons. That means that they have weaker electronegativity than many nonmetals. This allows metals to “give” some of their electrons to nonmetals, resulting in a dipole.A dipole is when a bond has a positive and negative charge at either end. The presence of a dipole indicates a polar bond.;
, Non metals are usually hard and brittle, and lack luster (shine). They often have a greater electronegativity than metals. This means that they can “take” the electrons from the metal atoms to which they are bound. This will create a dipole in the bond., The valence electrons of an atom are the ones that reside in its outer shell. For the most part, atoms follow the octet rule, meaning that eight valence electrons will create the most stable configuration. Atoms with nearly eight are likely to “take” other electrons, while atoms with only one or two valence electrons are likely to “give” up their outer electrons.For example, sodium (Na) has one valence electron, and chlorine (Cl) has seven. When they bond, they form the salt sodium chloride (NaCl) because the sodium gives up its one valence electron and the chlorine accepts it. This is a polar bond.

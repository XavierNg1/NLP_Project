 Unless you don't have a scanner, this is the best way to start. Try to get the anatomy and physiology of your subject as close as possible, but don't fret, as adjustments can be made later. Don't add too much detail such as fur or clothing texture just yet. Be sure to use pencil if you want to fix mistakes.With the sketch, getting the details right isn't as important as getting the general ideas and feel of the illustration down. The drawing will likely change a lot between this step and the final result.;
, Place your drawing face down on the scanner. Close the scanner and then start the scan. Name the file once it's finished scanning and save it as a .PNG or .JPEG for the highest quality.
 GIMP is good for beginners since it is free to download. It's probably not a good idea to use Microsoft Paint because of its limited features and hard to view canvas. A lot of people use Adobe Photoshop for making digital art.
 If you do not have a scanner, you can make your sketch directly in the program you're going to use. Plug the tablet into the computer using the cable that came with the tablet, and follow the instructions with the tablet to install the software.


Open the program you chose to draw with, and connect your tablet. Then create a new file, and start sketching.

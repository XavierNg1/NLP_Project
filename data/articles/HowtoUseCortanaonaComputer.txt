 If it's already there, skip this step. Right click on the taskbar, and choose Cortana from the menu. A drop down list will open up. Choose "Show search box" or "Show Cortana icon." Choosing to show Cortana and the search box is preferred, as you can search from it, but you can choose something else.;
, This is optional, but it makes it easier access to access Cortana with a simple command. Open Cortana and choose the Notebook. It is the second icon on the sidebar on the left. Once the Notebook is open, choose settings, and toggle the Hey Cortana switch from "Off" to "On." Then you can choose who Cortana responds best to.
 Open Cortana and choose the "Reminder" icon. It looks like a lightbulb with a checkmark on it. Click the plus sign (+) in the bottom right and fill out the boxes. Then save your reminder.
 Cortana can tell you simple things, such as what time it is, what the weather's like, and other simple things. You can ask, "How many days until Christmas," or "How old is Taylor Swift?"

, You shouldn't cheat, but if you're simply curious, or need an answer quickly, you can ask Cortana. You don't need to put in the question form, you can just simply state the equation. (For example, you can use 54+76 instead of "What is 54+76?")

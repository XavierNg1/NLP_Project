 Office lighting is usually behind a bezel lens with a frame. These types of recessed fixtures are holding the light tubes in place to minimize accidents and breakage. They can be very frustrating due to the lack of wiggle room or freedom of movement. The frame is held in place by lever locks or snaps that you have to take out.
 First, use a screwdriver to pry down the levers, while supporting the frame in the middle. It is important to support the frame because it can ruin the locks or swing down and hit you in the head.
 Take the opportunity, while the lens is down, to remove insects, dust, condensation or mold from the lens surface.
 Depending on the bulb, you will either need to twist, or unsnap, each end of the fluorescent tube. Be sure to only do one end at a time to maintain more control over the bulb. Once you wiggle the first tube out, the other tubes will come out much more easily.








Search for holes, or a recessed area, that the cathode/anode pin can sink into that permit freedom of movement.
 To install the new light, line its prongs up with the slots in either socket. Push the tube straight up into the sockets, and then rotate it 90 degrees until you feel it lock into place. You can give the lamp a gentle tug to ensure that it is firmly in place.
 When the last tube is in, swing the lens frame back in. Use both hands to support the frame in place. Then, use your thumbs to swing the frame lock back in.









Snap locks may need to be pressed firmly to snap back in.

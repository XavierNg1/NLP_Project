 You don't want to have bags under your eyes. Then get up a few hours before, so you have time to get ready without having to rush e.g. leave time to wash hair, dry hair, do makeup, and eat.;
, For example, going to the beach (casual), or to a restaurant (smart).
 Use nice smelling soap and shampoo then brush and towel dry or blow dry.
,, Carry breath mints with you.
 Wear something that suits the date, weather and your personality. Know what you look good in and emphasise your got parts e.g. nice legs (wear shorts if it's sunny), big boobs (low cut top). But don't show too much skin; you want to look modest and mature. Don't try to look older than you are.
 Maybe do a side braid, half up, bun or just leave it down. Make it suit your features.
 Use a bit of foundation to cover up any spots, use eye line and mascara to make your eyes stand out, use lip gloss and chapstick to make your lips nice and appealing.
 Wear cute stud earrings, bracelets and a necklace if you want to.
, He's probably just as nervous as you are!

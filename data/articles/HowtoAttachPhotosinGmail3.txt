 Gmail allows you to send photos from your phone as well as from your computer. Start by opening your app.
 In the upper-right corner of your screen, you will see an icon that looks like an envelope with a plus sign on it. Select it.
, Find the picture you want to send and select it.


Note that if you use the Android gallery, you can only select one photo at a time. If you back your photos up with Google Photos, however, you can select more than one.
Alternatively, you can copy photos directly from the internet. Tap and hold an image, then select copy. Paste the image directly into the body of your email.
 Once you have selected your photo, enter your recipientâ€™s email address, your subject line, and any message you wish to send.
 You have now sent an email with your chosen photo attached.


Note that you can also send a photo directly from an image. Tap the image you want to email, choose the left-pointing arrow, and select the Gmail icon; then, simply fill out the rest of the necessary information and send the email.

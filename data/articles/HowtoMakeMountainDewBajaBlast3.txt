 Before making your whipped cream, place the bowl and the beaters into the freezer for 15 minutes to chill. Once chilled, pour the whipping cream into the bowl and beat on medium speed until stiff peaks form, about nine minutes.Keep the cream in the refrigerator until it’s time to whip it. It’s important to chill everything before whipping because this will help incorporate air into the cream better.
 Add the sweetened condensed milk to the whipped cream and gently fold it in with a rubber spatula. Once that is fully incorporated, add the Mountain Dew and gently fold it in.


Folding is a baking technique used to combine ingredients with different densities.
To fold ingredients into the whipped cream, use the rubber spatula to scoop whipped cream from the bottom of the bowl and fold it around the other ingredients. This will protect the air bubbles making the whipped cream light and airy., To start, add five drops of yellow food coloring and two drops of green to the bowl with the ice cream base. Stir to combine. Add more food coloring if necessary, until you achieve the desired level of intensity.You can also play around with the color ratios to achieve a different color. For instance, try adding an extra drop of green, or fewer drops of yellow to the mix.
 Transfer the ice cream base to a freezer-safe bowl. Cover the top with a layer of plastic wrap to protect it from freezer burn. Press the plastic wrap down so it’s almost touching the top of the mixture. Put on the air-tight lid and transfer the mixture to the freezer.


Ideally, let the ice cream chill overnight, or for six to eight hours at least.
When the ice cream is thoroughly chilled, portion it out with an ice cream scoop and enjoy.

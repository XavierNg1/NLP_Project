 Ice wine is manufactured across the globe, but Germany and Canada are known for producing the best ice wines. If you’re looking for a traditional ice wine, select a wine from one of these two countries.Canadian and German wines primarily use Riesling grapes in their ice wines.Canadian wines do not age well and are best consumed when they are younger. German wines should be allowed to age a little longer.;
, The United States is not a major producer of ice wines, but it does have several very successful vineyards. If you’re buying ice wine from the US, look for wines manufactured in very cold regions, like Michigan or the Finger Lake region of New York.If you’re an ice wine super-fan or if you’re local to New York, visit the NY State Ice Wine Festival, which is held every February in Fairport, New York. Wineries across the region bring samples for vendors and new fans to sample and enjoy.
There are also other festivals scattered across New York, as well as across the country. Try Googling Ice Wine festivals to find an option near you.
 Australia is much warmer than other countries where ice wine is manufactured, and therefore, their methods are a bit more controversial. Australian ice wine is created using artificial freezing techniques, instead of natural freezing techniques.Tasters are unable to tell the difference between wines frozen artificially and wines frozen naturally, but if you're looking for a more traditional ice wine experience, avoid Australian ice wine.

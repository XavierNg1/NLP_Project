 If you don't know the depth of your fishing area multiple hooks at different lengths are an option. Size 2 hooks are good for bullhead and you won't catch a sunny usually. If you do catch a sunfish, or any other fish, you can cut it into chunks.;
, Do not put too much weight as the fish might spit it out when it feels the pressure. Another option is a leader tied to a swivel with sliding weights set above the swivel

, Catfish are bottom feeders and it pays to remember so.
 Stink baits are good along with homemade dough bait. Also corn and worms work well. The thing to remember is that Catfish can't see well but have a better smell then bloodhounds. Smelly and meaty are good. Pieces of fish work too. Using minnows and frogs from the area works very well too as the fish have likely encountered that food source before and remember its scent.
 In spring Catfish are shallow, in summer deep, in fall anywhere really. Wait for a bite then jerk the rod. If the baits smell is enticing to the catfish, they will come to it so just wait patiently.

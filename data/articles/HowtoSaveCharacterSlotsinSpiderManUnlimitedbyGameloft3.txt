 Look for the game app on your device. Its name is Spider-Man with the classic Spider-Man on the logo. Tap on it to launch it.
 On the main page, tap the red “My Team” button on the lower left corner. This will bring you to your current Spider-men roster. All your Spider-men’s character cards are displayed on the right side. Scroll up and down to view all of them.
 If you want to free up some character slots, you can sell the Spider-men occupying them. Tap the “Sell” button on the upper left corner, and your current roster of Spider-men will be displayed. Scroll through them and tap the ones you’d like to sell.


Be sure to sell only Spider-men you don’t need.
 Once done with your selection, tap the “Sell” button at the bottom right corner. Each Spider-Man you sell gets you 500 Vials, regardless of its rank or level.


What you get isn’t much, but considering the cost of a new character slot, it’s still a good option. Letting go of a low-level Spider-Man, which you may not be using anyway, for an empty character slot can be a good deal.
 Go back to My Team and you should be able to see some more empty character slots, ready to be filled up with new and better Spider-men.

 The 'budget' but classy way to do this is, to make one simple poster with white writing and a black background and get someone who works in an office to photocopy it as much as possible. Otherwise, you will have an extra cost for printing. Put the following on the poster


Headlining Band
Band on before them
Opening band
Location
Date
Cost
Any and all websites relating to bands, venue, tickets, you etc.
 Put them up in music stores, local youth hangouts, Internet cafes, schools/colleges (if allowed) and modern clothes shops.
 and tell them that the gig is on. Give them all the information you have on the poster, or even post them a copy of the poster. Write a Press Release, and send it to newspapers in your area, and the area of the gig, a few weeks before the gig. Try to get the newspaper to send a photographer if they have an 'Out& About' section or similar.
 Try to set up your own account dedicated to your organising gigs if you are really serious.

 This doesn't have to be done perfectly.;
, Some people insist on making an amaretto sour with one part amaretto and one part sweet and sour mix, while others make it with two parts amaretto and one part sweet and sour mix. It depends on what you want: more of a sweet and sour flavor, or more of a nutty, creamy flavor. You can use any type of amaretto, though Lazzaroni and DiSoronno are among the tastiest.
 If you're going for a 2-1 amaretto to sour mix ratio, then you'll want 1½ of amaretto and ¾ oz. of sweet and sour mix. If you want a 1-1 ratio, then you should pour 1½ oz. of amaretto and 1½ of sweet and sour mix. The sour mix is really a combination of water, sugar, and lemon juice. For an extra kick, you can even make your own. Fresh lemons instead of the pre-made stuff can really take this drink to the next level., Shake the strainer to combine the ingredients together nicely.
 Straining the mixed ingredients into a glass with fresh ice will give a cool, tasty feel to the beverage.
 You can garnish this tasty drink with an orange slice, a lemon wedge, or a maraschino cherry or two.
 Enjoy this tasty cocktail on its own or with some fruit, dessert, or other sweet snacks.

 This program will create a folder on your computer that is synced with your Google Drive account. All of your Google Drive files will be automatically updated on your computer when you make changes online, and vice versa. This program is available for both Windows and Mac.


Open the Google Drive website and log in with your Google account.
Click the Gear icon in the upper-right corner and select "Download Drive." If you don't see this option, click "Connect Drive to your desktop" in the left menu.
Select your operating system and download the installation file.
 After downloading the installer, you'll need to run it to install Google Drive onto your computer.


Windows - Run the googledrivesync.exe program to begin the installation process. Sign in with the Google account that you want to use the Drive program with and then follow the prompts to install.
Mac - Open the installgoogledrive.dmg file and drag the Google Drive icon to your Applications folder. Run Google Drive from your Applications folder and log in with the Google account you want to use with Drive.
 As soon as you finish installing, Google Drive will begin syncing all of the documents from your Google Drive to the Google Drive folder on your desktop. This may take a little while if you have lots of documents to sync.

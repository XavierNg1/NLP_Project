 Raise up both of your arms so they are going straight out from your shoulders. Then, bend one arm in towards your body, as if you are preparing to sneeze into your sleeve.Keep the other arm straight.;
, Next tuck your forehead down towards the arm that is bent and touch your forehead to your elbow area as if you are sneezing into your sleeve or dabbing sweat off of your brow.Keep the other arm straight.








Straighten out your arm after you dab your forehead on it.
 After you bring your head in towards your elbow, you can do a quick head bang motion (or two) before you straighten out your arm and switch sides.Just quickly jolt your head forward towards your elbow.









Head banging is generally considered safe, but keep in mind that is can cause injuries if you do it too hard.You can always skip the head bang motion if you have concerns.
 You can repeat the dab multiple times on one side or switch sides. If you switch sides, then repeat the same dab movement on the other side with your other arm. For example, if you started by dabbing on your left side, then switch over to your right side.









Keep switching back and forth along with the music.
 You can do the dab movement with your upper body and move your lower body however you like. You can hop around, walk around, or wiggle your hips.









You can also do other moves in between dabs, such as waving your fists in the air or moving your arms from side to side in front of you.Add your own flair and just try to have fun!

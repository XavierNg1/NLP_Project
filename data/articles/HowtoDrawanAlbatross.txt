 Erase all the rectangles and detail the bird's tail as shown.
 They can range in darkness and length, depending on your preference. Make sure to include an eye and more defined beak on your bird.
 Most albatrosses come in light or not very diverse colors, but make the beak a vibrant yellow and add shadows/highlighting to the feathers if you wish.

, The audience might be looking at your working leg, but your focus must be on your supporting leg. Your adagio depends on it. Your supporting side should be solid and feel rooted in the ground, like a tree., Adagio can be used to work on phrasing and moving the head, arms, and gaze as well as the legs. Your line is not just your extension - even a spectacular extension is meaningless without coordination with the rest of the body., Do not sacrifice extension for placement! Distorted placement looks terrible., Step into an arabesque with the leg at a height you can control. Hold for a count of five. Repeat several times, stepping onto the same leg, until you are all the way across the studio. Repeat on the other side. This will help your arabesque be more secure., Stretch frequently - barre stretches and splits, as well as stretching the quads, hips, and back., This will help you shoot your leg way up high. Then try to capture it in a correct position.

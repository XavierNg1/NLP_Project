Weighted lunges can either be performed with a dumbbell in each hand or a barbell across the back.
However, barbell lunges should be reserved for more advanced athletes who have very good balance.
As with most strength exercises, you should start with a low weight and work your way up.



With the dumbbells in your hands (by your sides) or the barbell resting on the trapezius muscles (the muscle below the neck and between the back of the shoulders), step forward with one foot into a lunge position.
Both knees should form a 90 degree angle. The front knee should not extend beyond the toes and the back knee should not touch the ground.



With the weighted lunge, your feet remain in the same position as you complete the desired number of repetitions. You simply need to bend your knees up and down to perform the exercise.Remember to keep your back straight, your shoulders back and relaxed, your chin up and your core engaged as you complete your repetitions.



Once you have completed the desired number of repetitions, switch legs and repeat the exercise on the other side.

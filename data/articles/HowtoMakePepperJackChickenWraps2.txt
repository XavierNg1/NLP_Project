 Wash one head of romaine lettuce and dry it thoroughly. You'll also need to was one ripe avocado. Chop the lettuce into bite-sized pieces and set it aside. Slice the avocado and remove it from the peel. Set the sliced avocado aside.To dry the lettuce, you can spin it in a salad spinner or lay it on clean kitchen towels.
 Lay 4 8-inch multi-grain or whole wheat flour tortillas on your work surface. Lay 3 slices of pepper jack cheese on each tortilla. Divide the chopped lettuce over each wrap and place some of the sliced chicken breast or chicken tenders on the lettuce.Keep in mind that if you use chicken tenders, you'll probably need about 2 pieces for each wrap.
 Finish filling the wraps by dividing 1/2 cup (130 g) of chunky salsa over each wrap. This will work out to be about 1/8 of a cup (around 33 g). You should also divide and scatter 1/2 cup (134 g) of sliced pimiento-stuffed olives on the wraps along with the sliced avocado.You can easily leave out or substitute other ingredients. For example, instead of avocado, you could use strips of red bell pepper or roasted red peppers.
 Fold one half of the wrap over the filling towards the other side. Tuck in the ends so the filling is contained and roll the wrap over itself towards the other side. Roll all four wraps and serve them whole or sliced in half.If you need to refrigerate the wraps, you can wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and keep them in the refrigerator for up to 4 hours.

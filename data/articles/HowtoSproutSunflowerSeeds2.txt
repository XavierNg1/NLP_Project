 You'll need black oil sunflower seeds, glass pie dishes (at least two), and some healthy soil from your local garden store (preferably organic).
 Take one of your glass pie dishes and fill it with soil until it is just below the crust lip.
 Take a 1/4 cup of seeds and soak them in a bowl of water, completely covered in water, for 8 hrs.
 Spread the seeds across the soil and then water them thoroughly.
 Place the bottom surface of the second pie plate on top of the soil, as if you were nesting the plates. Press down and drain the excess water.
 Store your sprouting seed (with the second pie dish still on top) in a warm, dark place. Wait about three days, but check on them every day. When the upper plate is lifted about an inch, remove it from the dark place.
 Remove the upper plate and place the sprouts in a sunny location.
 When they're ready to be eaten, cut the sprouts and rinse them to get rid of the shells. From the time you take them into the sun, it takes roughly another two days for them to be ready to eat. Shorter if it's very warm where you live. Try them in salads, sushi, soup, or sandwiches. Enjoy!

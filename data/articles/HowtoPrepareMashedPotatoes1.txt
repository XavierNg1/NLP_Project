 After you wash the potatoes thoroughly under cool water, use a sharp knife or a potato peeler to peel off the skin. You can also keep the skin on Yukon Gold or red skin potatoes, if you like, but baking potatoes should be peeled., First, boil the water by itself, adding a pinch of salt. The pot should be large enough to comfortably hold the potatoes without crowding them. Once the water begins to boil, add the potatoes and cook them covered for 15-20 minutes, or until they are soft. To test them, put a fork in them and see if they are tender enough to slide right off the fork. When they're done, drain the water from the pot and transfer them to a plate., Begin to mash the potatoes and add 2 tablespoon (29.6Â ml). of melted butter and 1/2 cup of milk along the way. This will make them taste richer and creamier and will make them easier to mash as well. A potato masher is ideal for mashing potatoes, but you can also use a large fork, a whisk, or a wooden spoon.


You can also mash potatoes with the following tools: a wire masher, a stainless steel masher, a ricer, or an electric mixer.

Do not mash potatoes with a food processor, or you'll end up with a gooey mess.
 Add 1/2 tsp. of salt and pepper to taste to add flavor to the potatoes.
 Garnish the mashed potatoes with 4 sprigs of parsley and enjoy them while they're hot.

 Once you’ve identified your feelings about the person, and you’ve figured out the moment that you felt that way, you need to dig more deeply into these feelings. Your mixed emotions may have several different causes. Understanding these causes will help you resolve your mixed feelings.


For example, if you have low self-esteem,you may not feel worthy of this person and therefore you won’t let yourself commit to a relationship.
 A common reason why we have mixed emotions about someone is that this person reminds us of someone in our past. We may unconsciously assign certain qualities or expectations to a new person, based on our relationship and experience with the person in our past, in a process called “transference.”Your boss reminds you of your mean first-grade teacher, so you don’t like to follow your boss’ directions.


Think about people in your life that made you feel a similar way as you feel now toward this new person. See if you can identify a similar pattern.
 Does this person treat you with respect? Is he abusive to you? When someone treats you nicely one minute and meanly the next, this can leave you confused with your own feelings. Think about how other people treat you. Do you get mixed feelings when another person treats you this way?

, Identifying your own feelings that may or may not be related to the other person is crucial for understanding how to deal with mixed feelings. Once you can separate your own feelings from the feelings that this person gives you, you might be able to identify your true emotions once and for all.

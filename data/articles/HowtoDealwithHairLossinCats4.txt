 Biting parasites like fleas can be a common source of irritation that can lead to hair loss. However, these pests can be difficult to spot. Instead, look for flea dirt, which is the dried blood left behind when a flea bites your cat’s skin.


Brush your cat’s hair in the opposite direction and look for brown flakes or specks.
Wet a paper towel and put some of these flecks on the towel. When the flea dirt comes into contact with the moisture, it should become red or orange again as the blood is reconstituted.
 Flea medication generally acts by inhibiting nerve transmission in fleas, which causes them to become paralyzed and die. Common flea medications contain fipronil or selamectin.


The recommended dose of flea medication is generally 6 mg/kg that is applied to the skin on the back of the cat's neck.
 If you have more than one pet in your house, it is important that you treat all of them for fleas, so long as they have fur. If you only treat one animal, it is very likely that they pick up fleas again from the other animal in your house.


You should also consider using an insecticide (or ‘flea bomb’) in your house to remove fleas from your furniture and carpets.

, Place 2 1/2 to 3 cups of almonds in a quart jar, add 1⁄2 to 1 tablespoon (7.4 to 14.8 ml) Celtic sea salt and fill to the brim with filtered water. Soak overnight or a minimum of seven hours.
 Drain the almonds and spread them in a single layer on a cookie sheet or several pie plates. Place them in the oven on warm setting, no higher than 175 degree F. Allow them to remain in the oven around 12 hours, stirring with your hand occasionally and taste-testing for crispness.
 They will become slightly more crisp as they cool.
 Place the cooled almonds in a food processor with the chopping blade in place. Replace the lid and tube pusher to prevent escapees. Grind on high until almonds are a coarse powder.
 With the processor still running, add 7 to 8 tablespoons (100 to 120 ml) of a light oil. Raw almond oil does not seem to be widely available, but unrefined walnut oil works well. Continue to process until nut butter is moving slowly but freely around the processor bowl.
 Taste the almond butter and add up to 1/4 tsp more sea salt or to taste. (If using sweetener, add it now.)

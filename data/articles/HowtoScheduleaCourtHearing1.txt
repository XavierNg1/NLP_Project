 When you file a claim, the clerk may put a date on your claim. This date typically is the deadline for the other side to respond.


In some jurisdictions you don't have to show up at court on that date, but in others you do. The clerk will let you know if you are expected to be there.For example, in Connecticut small claims court the clerk gives the defendant a deadline to respond. No one has to show up in court on that date.However, in Indiana the clerk assigns a first date when you file your claim, and if the defendant intends to dispute your claim she must show up on that date. If she does not, you win by default.;
, The other side has a period of time to respond to your lawsuit. If there is no response, you can begin the process of requesting a default judgment., Once the other side responds, contact the clerk to get a hearing date.


In some jurisdictions, the small claims clerk will put your case on the small claims docket automatically and mail both you and the person you sued notice of the date, time, and location of your trial. If the date does not work for you, you will have to file a continuance asking the court to postpone the trial.If your jurisdiction requires you to show up to an initial hearing, the judge will set the matter for trial at that time if the defendant shows up and disputes your claim., If you select a date, you must send notice to the other side. If the clerk selects the date for you, the clerk generally will send notice to both parties.

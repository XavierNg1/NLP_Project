 Stay clear of onomatopoeia, oft-used internet acronyms & numbers. Names like these will do you little credit. Eg: "BAMitsJack" "OMGitsJack-" "LOLJackLOL" "Jack1997";
, Stay clear of clich√©s such as "I'm not crazy ask my oven", "My motto ran that way", "A fat kid ate my motto" etc. If you're really stumped, song lyrics are your friend.
 Do not copy anyone wholesale. If you are new, it's good to scout around & see what others are wearing. Or you could join a modelling contest if you don't mind getting clued in rather rudely. After getting eliminated a few times, I caught on that pink skin isn't cool & neither is salmon-coloured hair.
 Never give up what you are not ready to lose.
 It does not matter how many witnesses you have. Their collective word is as good as yours.

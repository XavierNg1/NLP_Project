 One such program is the LeechBlock addon for Mozilla Firefox. You can set a limit for how much internet you can access in a set time frame and block sites altogether during certain times, for instance. The addon has many options and ways of limiting time wasting while on the internet. It also has a "lockdown" feature where all internet access can be blocked for a length of time.

 A frappe is a whipped, frozen coffee drink invented in Greece and made popular by Starbucks as a "Frappuccino."Simply toss your coffee in a blender with 6-8 large cubes of ice, 1/2 cup of milk, and blend until there are only small chips of ice left in the drink. Consider adding:


Chocolate syrup or cocoa powder.
Caramel syrup.
Vanilla or almond extract.
Crushed cookiesCondensed or chocolate milk.
Kahlua, brandy, or Irish Cream.
 You can add them before chilling your pot of cold-brew or right before serving. Spiced coffee goes well with 1/2 cup condensed or regular milk as well. Some suggestions include:


1-2 teaspoons of orange zest with 2-3 crushed pods of cardamon.1 teaspoon of cinnamon, ground cloves, and nutmeg.1 tablespoon honey and 5-10 crushed, chopped mint leaves.
Sprinkle of sea salt and 1-2 teaspoons cocoa powder.
 This dessert treat is a wonderfully sweet take on refreshing, cold coffee. Brew a pot of espresso. Place one scoop of ice cream at the bottom of a coffee cup and slowly pour the espresso over the top. Enjoy with a spoon.

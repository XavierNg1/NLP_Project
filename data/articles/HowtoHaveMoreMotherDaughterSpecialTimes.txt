 Botanical gardens are great to visit because you can see special floral displays at different times of the year and this might help both of you with garden plans. It might be nice to sit down with a calendar of garden events and circle dates that both of you will attend the events together. Pencil in at least one event a month.;
, Who said you can't take your mom to the movies? She'll be thrilled to see a chick flick with you and you can get all teary together without anybody having to pretend it isn't affecting you emotionally. Use online search resources to find out about movies in advance and pencil in the dates in advance, again, at least monthly. And consider buying a book of 10 tickets; you'll not only save money but have an incentive to keep going too.
 Go and fly a hot air balloon together, parachute from a small plane, or bungee jump. These sorts of thrill will bring you very close together, sharing the adrenalin rush and fear together.
 This might sound odd but it is easier to clean with two together and you can take tea breaks together. The motivation is great, plus you get to spend time together getting tasks done more efficiently. Go out after to a movie or to dinner as your reward.
 Go to beautiful natural places to commune with nature together.
 If both of you like a certain hobby or craft, attend lessons or events together to do with the hobby or craft. You can keep one another company, learn something new and make new friends all at once.
 You can share your likes and dislikes of different books and learn a lot about one another in the process.

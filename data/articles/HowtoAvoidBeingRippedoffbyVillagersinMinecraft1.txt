 The Villagers that currently roam their villages are librarians, priests, farmers, blacksmiths, butchers/tailors and generics (modified in). Farmers wear brown, librarians wear white, priests wear dark pink, blacksmiths wear a black apron, butchers/tailors wear a white apron, and generics wear green robes.;
, People might often just run about trying to trade whatever willy-nilly, but that won't help. If you have some paper or books you wrote, trade with a librarian! If you want something enchanted, trade with a priest (though it is usually much more efficient to enchant things yourself).
 Emeralds are used as a currency for the villagers, and every trade is an exchange of an item for an emerald. They are found in Extreme Hills and Extreme Hills Edge biomes between height levels 32 and 4. However, even when mining in an extreme hills biome they are rarer than diamonds, so it's best to just trade for them. If hoarded, emeralds can buy extremely rare or difficult to make items like saddles, enchanted books, and diamond armor, but the villagers that sell these are rare and most try to sell common items like bread or glass.
 These can easily be mistaken by people who just trade trade trade, but it is true. They can try to trade a flint and steel in exchange for an emerald, an iron shovel for an emerald, four an emerald for a diamond etc. The vast majority of a villager's trades will be ripoffs, and they will charge very large amounts of emeralds for desirable items like diamond gear and chain armor and enchanted books.

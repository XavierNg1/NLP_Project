 You can select specific options for the following attributes associated to your search results.


Brand: an eBay seller may sometimes mention Droid on his or her product listing even though the product is not a Droid. For example, the seller may be selling an Apple iPhone and comparing it to a Droid. To avoid such product listings, select "Motorola" within the list of brands so you can see results that are specifically for Motorola Droid.
Carrier: even though the main carrier for Droid phones is Verizon Wireless, you can see other carriers also listed. Usually you should just select "Verizon" to refine your search, although you may want to consider other options like "Unlocked" if you want to buy a Droid on eBay that is no longer associated with any carrier.
Condition: choose the condition that the phone should be in. Options include new, manufacturer refurbished, seller refurbished, and phones that are not working but can still be used for spare parts.

 Using an ice cream scooper, place 7-10 scoops of ice cream on a tray an inch apart.;
, After scooping the ice cream, place them in the freezer to harden for 20-30 minutes.
 Mix two eggs together to make the egg wash.
 Fill a deep-frying pan with3 inches (7.6Â cm) Canola oil. Heat it to 375 degrees. Heat the oil while your ice cream is freezing so it won't melt while you're waiting for the oil to heat up.
, After you have coated the ice cream scoops with egg wash, cover them with the crushed corn flakes or bread. Roll the ice cream around in it until the ice cream is completely covered. If you are using white bread, rip off strips of the bread and cover the ice cream scoops.
 Now that the ice cream scoops are covered with corn flakes or bread, you can start deep-frying them. To test if the oil is hot, take an ice cream scoop and touch it to the oil. If the oil sizzles, it's ready. Gently place your ice cream scoops in the oil for 5-8 seconds.
 Serve and enjoy!

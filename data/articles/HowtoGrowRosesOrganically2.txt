 When the roses are blooming, remove the faded blossoms to encourage more flowers to grow. This process is called ‘deadheading’. Make sure to dispose of the dead heads in the compost pile, rather than leaving them on the ground.
 All roses require some pruning in late fall, winter or very early spring. Use sharp hand pruners with a scissor action to prune your roses.


Dull and anvil-type pruners will crush the rose stem, causing serious damage to the bush.
 Growth buds on rose stems are usually located where a leaf with five leaflets is growing. The new stem will grow from the growth bud just below the pruning cut.
 The amount of the rose that should be pruned off depends on the type of rose. Shrub roses and mini’s usually need only light pruning to shape them after they have been planted for two years.


Large roses like hybrid teas should have all of their stems cut back by about two-thirds every year.
If there are any branches growing across and rubbing other branches, they should be removed. Dead branches should be pruned off whenever they are noticed throughout the year.
 In hot climates where roses are not exposed to freezing temperatures, prune off all of the leaves in January so the rose can start fresh each spring. Seal stems that are thicker than a pencil with white household glue to keep insects out.

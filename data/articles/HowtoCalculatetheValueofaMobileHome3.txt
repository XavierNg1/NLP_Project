 Look for someone who is certified or has a state license.These are signs of sufficient training and skill. You can find an appraiser in the following places:


Obtain a referral from a state appraisal board. Type “your state” and “appraisal board” into your favorite search engine. Check to see if your state board has a directory you can search.
Search the directory of an accreditation society, such as the American Society of Appraisers.
Contact a real estate agent for a referral to someone who is qualified.
 Mobile homes can present many challenges to appraisers who do not have sufficient experience. Ask appraisers whether they have a certification to appraise mobile homes or whether they have ever taken a course on manufactured home appraisals.Keep researching appraisers until you find one sufficiently knowledgeable about mobile homes.
 You should meet the appraiser at the mobile home. They may have questions about the neighborhood or the property.Answer them as completely and honestly as you can.


The appraiser also needs space to perform the appraisal, so don’t hover. Give them enough space to do their job properly.
A typical appraisal takes a few hours and costs around $300-400., When you receive the report, you should study it closely. You’ll want to make sure that the appraiser used appropriate homes for comparison purposes.


Also check whether the appraiser properly valued features that can add value to your mobile home, such as location to public transportation or proximity to a good school district.If you disagree with something in the appraisal report, bring it to the appraiser’s attention. Write a letter laying out what you think the appraiser overlooked.

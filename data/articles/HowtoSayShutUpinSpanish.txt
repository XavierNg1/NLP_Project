 "Cállate" is the literal translation of "shut up" in Spanish, and there are a few ways to say it. The word is pronounced "ka-ya-tay." Here's what you can say:"¡Cállate!" ("Shut up!")
"¡Cállense!" ("Shut up!" to a group of people.)
"Cállate, por favor." ("Please shut up.")
"Necesito que te calles." ("I need you to shut up.");
, Instead of telling people to shut up, you could take a more polite approach and ask for silence instead. This will get your point across but won't be quite as offensive. Here's what you can say:


"Silencio." ("Silence.")
"Guarde silencio." ("Keep silent.")
"Haga silencio." ("Be quiet.")

, If you really want to say "shut up" and "cállate" just isn't doing it for you, you can take a more forceful approach. Here are a few ways to really get your point across:


"¡Cierra la boca!" ("Shut your mouth!")
"¡Cierra el hocico!" ("Shut your trap!")
"¡Cierra el pico!" ("Shut your mouth/trap!")

 First, launch a web browser and visit the login page of your email account provider like Yahoo, Google or Outlook.;
, On the login page you’ll see a link or a button labeled “Forgot Password.” Click this link or button and you’ll be directed to a Password Recovery page.
 On the Password Recover page, enter an alternate email address where the service provider can send a temporary password, which you can use to access the blocked email account.


It can be from the same email provider or from another.
 Before the email provider gives you a temporary password, you need to prove you are the owner of the account you’re trying to access. Fill out a personal information sheet about the account like your contact lists, emails addresses you recently sent an email to, name of folders you created inside, and/or answer your security question.


Your answers will be evaluated and once you’ve been verified to be the owner of the account, you’ll receive the temporary password on the alternate email address you provided.
 Access your blocked account using the temporary password sent to you. You’ll be immediately required to set a new one. Enter the new password you like to use in your account and make sure to remember it well this time.

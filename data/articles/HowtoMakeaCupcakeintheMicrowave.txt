 If you're planning on making this at work or where you study, measure out the cake mix in a small container with a lid, and the yogurt into another. On the way to work or studies, grab some soda water and place it all in the shared fridge in the staff or tea room until needed. Remember to also take along some suitable baking paper to line the cup with, so that it doesn't stick.
 Create a smooth consistency â€“ there shouldn't be any lumps. Add the rest of the water and mix in thoroughly.


If you don't have a bowl, mix straight in the cup, although this will be more challenging. Even a small breakfast bowl is suitable for this cupcake mix.
 Carefully pour the batter into the cup.
 Monitor it closely, as microwaves vary in wattage and temperature.






The cupcake will be ready when it starts to move away from the sides of the cup and changes from a liquid to forming a firm-looking, sponge-like top. Perform the toothpick test to see if it's done.
 Dress it up with whipped cream and sprinkle a few chocolate chips on top.

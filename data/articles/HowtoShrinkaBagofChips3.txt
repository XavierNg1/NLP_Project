 Use a paper hole puncher to create a small hole in the corner of the bag. Carefully thread a keychain loop through the hole to make a colorful and stylish accessory for your key chain.


Staple the top of the bag shut if youâ€™re concerned the bag will rip while in your pocket. This also provides some additional heft to the bag.
Scissors or an awl can also be used to create a hole for the keychain loop if you don't have a hole puncher handy.
 Secure the shrunken bag to your backpack or purse with a safety pin. They make a great addition to the decorative buttons and pins that are common on backpacks.


Lapel pins and studs can also be used to secure the bag to your backpack. Check your local jeweler for information on the types of backs you can use., Use a bit of glue to paste the bags into your scrapbook. Opt for making the bags a bit flatter (using the second baking tray) so that they better fit in the book. You can also cut and modify the bags to create collages according to your liking.
 Punch a hole in the top of matching chip bags and affix them to earring hooks to create a colorful pair of earrings! Or punch 4 holes into each end of a bag that is only half shrunken to create a perfect bangle. Use a few leather cord and jewelry clasps to affix to the bag and create a unique bracelet.The bags will be small and hard, and generally difficult to shape. The bags become easier to bend if they aren't fully shrunk.

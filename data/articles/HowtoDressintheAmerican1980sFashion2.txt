 Think bold geometric designs for sweaters or Hawaiian print for shirts. Look for a thick sweater with a bulky, boxy cut.
 Authentic jackets had a black tag over the breast pocket that read "Members Only," but if you cannot find an authentic jacket, simply mimic the style. Look for a cotton-polyester jacket with a nylon lining, elastic waistband, elastic wrists, a zipper front, and snaps at the neck. Choose a coat in any color.
 Light acid wash jeans work best. Find a style that fits snug around your legs, since men in tight jeans were more fashionable during this decade than those in baggy jeans.
 In the early 1980s, these pants were tighter, but by the end of the decade, they were exceptionally baggy. Look for a pair of pants made from shiny synthetic material. If possible, find one with multiple zippers, since these were considered more stylish.
 If you want a more professional look, go for a conservative cut suit jacket in a pastel blue or other light color. Pair the jacket with white pants. This look is also known as the "Miami Vice" look.
 Loafers work best when paired with pastel suit jackets and other conservative styles.
 If you decide to go with acid wash jeans or parachute pants, find a heavy pair of sneakers or boots. Consider thick-soled black boots that lace up.
 Run a volume-enhancing hair product through your hair to give it a little extra lift. Keep your locks in place with hair gel or hairspray.

 It is okay to ask someone about their feelings for you.It may seem embarrassing at first, but if she cares about you, either as a friend or something more, she will get over it and appreciate that you feel comfortable enough to be open and honest. Here are some ways you can ask:


"How do you feel about me?"
"Do you see me as a friend, or do you see me becoming something more?"

, If you do not want to come straight out and ask how she feels about you, then ask questions about love that may help you figure things out. Here are some questions you can ask:


"How do you feel about falling in love?"
"Do you think people can fall in love after being good friends?"

, Girls tell their friends almost everything. If you are too nervous to directly ask a girl if she has feelings for you, casually ask a friend she is close to. Be aware that once you start inquiring to friends, they will likely report what you said back to this girl. Here are casual questions you can ask:


"Do you know if she like anyone?"
"Does she ever talk about dating?"

, If a girl finds a reason to constantly bring up your name, speaks positively of you when you are not around, or smiles when your name is mentioned, she has strong feelings for you.
 Build up some courage and ask this girl to see a movie with you, or grab dinner. If she dresses up, or puts on more makeup than usual, then she is trying to impress you. A girl who loves you will want to stand out in your eyes by looking great and being fun.

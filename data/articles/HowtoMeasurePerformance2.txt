 Performance appraisals of this type are typically subjective, rather than objective. They are most valuable when objective criteria such as as production rate, cycle time, cost, and error rate are used. Each department should have its own quantifiable measurements so work can be compared to pre-determined standards, group norms, trends, and employee-to-employee. Collect the data systematically, and determine if the guidelines being used to conduct business are adequate.For example, you might track the amount of time a customer waits in line.
Regularly document the number of items or reports an employee can produce in an hour.
Be sure to clearly communicate performance measures and expected performance to employees before measurement begins. Training in this areas might be required.
 When the data collection begins, set plans and goals for job performance. Once the data has been collected, measure it to see if your goals were achieved. If not, a baseline can be established and used to set goals for improvement throughout the organization. If customers typically wait in line for 3 minutes before being addressed, strive to lower the customer response time.
Conflict resolution through customer support can be a daunting task. Once you know the amount of time a typical call takes, it can help your company streamline the process by identifying which calls take longer.
Use percentage-based quantitative improvement goals. If the company sold $500,000 worth of product last quarter, attempt to increase sales by 1%.
 Progress must be measured and acted upon. If a performance measurement is lacking, periodic measurement needs to occur to ensure progress is being made. The measurements also serve to determine whether or not the plan of action is working.Utilize exemplary programs to serve as a guide for those that are lacking.
Do not hesitate to change a plan if measurement shows no progress is being made.

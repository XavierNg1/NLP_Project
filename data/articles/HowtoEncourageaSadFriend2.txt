 Get silly together. Play some music and silly dance. Rent a funny movie and watch it with her. Tell her some funny jokes. Reminisce about funny memories you share together.
 Offer to go shopping together. That can be a fun venture. Offer to take her to lunch to talk or to get her around other people. Consider your friend's personality and hobbies. Ask yourself, "What can I do to encourage my friend and distract her? What does she enjoy doing?"


Your friend may initially decline your invitation. She may tell you that she's not up to going anywhere. Encourage her and tell her that she doesn't need to be alone during this sad time and that getting around other people would be good for her., The gift could be something as simple as a small box of candy, a bottle of scented lotions, or her favorite flowers. A sincere card that addresses her specific issue is appreciated as well. Any of those items will tell your friend that you appreciate her and that you're thinking of her in her time of need. They will also help her get her mind off of her problems, if only temporarily.Your action gives your friend evidence that there are people in the world who care about her pain and want to help.
Your friend will remember what you did for her when she's alone and sad.

 A new school is stressful, but the more of an effort you make to learn the people's names and the ways of the school, the more likely they'll be excited to learn things about you.
 Let them know what you've done in your past class, and see if there's anything you need to do to catch up.
 This isn't always easy, but the sooner you find friends the sooner you'll feel comfortable in your new school. Talk to people in the hallways, join a club or a sport, or sit by someone that looks nice at lunch. You may go through a couple friend groups before you find the one that's right for you

, You're likely missing your old schoolâ€”you may even resent your friends for getting to stay when you had to move. It's important to remember, though, that they are likely feeling your absence just as much as you are. Make an effort to keep in touch with them. This will help strengthen your friendships and help keep you grounded.

, This fast method is suitable for yeast breads apart from those that will sit overnight or soured loaves. It can only be used with granulated freeze-dried yeast.

Place the granulated dried yeast into the flour with all other ingredients, including the liquid, at the same time.
Ensure that the temperature of the liquid is a little higher, as this will help to both dissolve the yeast and distribute it through the dough.
 This method is useful for giving the dough a stronger, more sour flavor. It works as follows:

Dissolve the yeast in a little warm water.
Add enough flour to it to make a sponge.
Leave the yeast sponge to prove over several hours. It can even be left overnight.
Add the other ingredients and knead the dough. Leave to rise as usual.

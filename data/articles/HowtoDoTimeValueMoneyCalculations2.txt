 Present value can be defined as "the current-day value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows given a specified rate of return (interest rate)."This rate of return, called the discount rate, is used to decrease the future value of the payment or cash to find its present value. Finding the appropriate discount rate is important for properly valuing future cash flows.

In simpler terms, present value expresses the reality that a $10,000 payment now is worth more to an investor than a $10,000 payment in five years.

Put another way, to find the present value of the future $10,000, we need to find out how much we would have to invest today in order to receive that $10,000 in the future., The present value is equation is very similar to the future value equation, except the exponent for the number of years is negative. The equation is usually stated as PV=FV(1+r)n{\displaystyle PV={\frac {FV}{(1+r)^{n}}}}. The variables stand for the following:

PV is the present value.

FV is the future value. This represents the stated value of the future payment. 

r is the discount rate. This can be many different relevant rates, especially in corporate finance, but here we are using the interest earned on a compound interest-earning account. 

n is the number of periods (years in this case)., One of the uses of present value is to determine how much money would need to be put into an account now so that the value of the account reached a certain amount in a number of years. For example, imagine that you are saving for college and wish to have an account value of $50,000 in ten years. The account earns 7.5 percent interest each year. To find the investment needed now to reach this value, input your variables in the present value equation.

Your future value is $50,000, n is 10, and r is 0.075 (7.5% expressed as a decimal by dividing by 100). So, your completed equation is: PV=$50,000(1+0.075)10{\displaystyle PV={\frac {\$50,000}{(1+0.075)^{10}}}}

Start by adding the 1 to i in the parentheses to get: PV=$50,000(1.075)10{\displaystyle PV={\frac {\$50,000}{(1.075)^{10}}}}

Next, solve the exponent above the parentheses to get: PV=$50,0002.061{\displaystyle PV={\frac {\$50,000}{2.061}}}

The exponent can be solved on a calculator by inputting the variable in parentheses first, pressing the exponent button (usually xy{\displaystyle x^{y}}), and then inputting the exponent and pressing enter. 

Note that the result, 2.061, is a rounded number. If you do not round this number, you will get a different final result than in the example. 



Finally, solve the remaining division to get PV=$24,260.07{\displaystyle PV=\$24,260.07}

You only need to invest $24,260.07 in the account now to have $50,000 in ten years.
 Imagine that you are going to receive a payment of $10,000 in five years and you want to know how much less this will be worth than if you got the money now. For the discount rate, imagine that you have an account you could put the $10,000 into that would earn five percent annual interest.

First, put your variables into the present value equation. The completed equation is as follows: PV=$10,000(1+0.05)5{\displaystyle PV={\frac {\$10,000}{(1+0.05)^{5}}}}

Solve the addition within parentheses first. This yields: PV=$10,000(1.05)5{\displaystyle PV={\frac {\$10,000}{(1.05)^{5}}}}

Then, solve the exponent. This yields: PV=$10,0001.276{\displaystyle PV={\frac {\$10,000}{1.276}}}

Note that the result, 1.276 is a rounded figure. You will get a different final result if you do not round this number. 



Divide the last two numbers. Your result is $7,836.99. 

So, getting $10,000 in five years is like getting $7,836.99 now.

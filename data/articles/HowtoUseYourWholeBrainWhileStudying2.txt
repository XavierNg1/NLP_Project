 Start studying as soon as you can after school. The minute you come in the door, get everything together that you need and begin your study session. Not only will the information be fresher in your mind right after school, you’ll also head off potential distractions before they have a chance to affect you.
 Maybe you think you can study just as well with a messy desk as you can with a neat one. In reality, though, having only the things you need right where you need them eliminates distractions and makes your study time more efficient.Place your pencils, notebook, folders, textbook, calculator, and any other important study materials within easy reach so you don’t lose focus while reaching or looking for them.
 Choose a quiet, isolated spot for your study space. Ask not to be disturbed. Play soothing music or put on noise-canceling headphones to block out distracting sounds if necessary. Keep common distractions like cell phones tucked away and/or out of reach, and silenced or shut off., Before you begin studying, and during your study session, take a moment to gather yourself and reduce your stress level. Do some deep breathing exercises, meditate or pray, listen to some soothing music, or do whatever else helps you to relax. Excess stress will cause you to lose focus.
 Generally speaking, do not spend more than an hour studying without having a break, because your brain gets tired and can’t give full attention to the subject. Make them quick breaks — just a couple minutes — so that you don’t lose your momentum. Just give yourself enough time to take a drink, stretch out a bit, use the bathroom, do a quick calming exercise, or something similar.

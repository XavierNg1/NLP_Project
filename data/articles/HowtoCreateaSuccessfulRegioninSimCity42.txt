 You will want the land to be flat, so don't go crazy creating your landscape. The city needs to be flat because industrial zones don't do well on crooked land.
 Do not add any residential zones. Instead of adding another power plant to this city, you can drag power lines to the edge of the town and create a neighbor connection. Accept the power deal that is offered to you. That way, you are buying power for a small price instead of maintaining your own.


You should see factories and other buildings develop very rapidly. This is because the demand for jobs in your other city is high because it offers only a handful of jobs. Demand will always "flow" between cities. They will work in this industrial city. Once development tapers off, save and exit to your region.
 Remove the small amount of industry you put there earlier. Most of your Sims now work in the industrial city. A very small amount still work at the power plant. Keep zoning low density residential until development tapers off. Once your residential city has a population of over 1,100 Sims, you can start zoning medium density. Make sure you provide those zones with water.
 A community of well-educated Sims attracts wealthy businesses to your Commercial city well and High-Tech Industry to your Industrial one. Add health care facilities to ensure your Sims live to ripe old age.
 As your population grows, demand for industrial jobs grows. And in turn, the industrial development will attract new Sims to your Residential city. Once you seem to have a strong pattern going between your two cities, it is time to create a new city.


If the road or roads going into the industrial city are getting overcrowded, you may try upgrading to an avenue, to handle the extra traffic.

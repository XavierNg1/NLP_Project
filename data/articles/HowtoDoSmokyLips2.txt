 For a classical look, choose a bright, flat red color. This look is different from the traditional smoky lip look in that it is more ombre. It is reminiscent of the smoky eye look.








For a twist, try a different color, such as bright purple or pink., Use an angled lipstick brush to smooth out your base coat, especially around the outline and corners of your lips. You are not using lip liner for this look, but you still want it to be as sharp and neat as possible.








Do not clean off your brush just yet. You will use the residual lipstick on the brush to blend everything together towards the end.
 Start at the very corner of your lips and go inward towards the center, about ¼ to ⅓ of the way. Don't worry if it looks weird at the moment; you will fix it in the next step.








You can also use black lip liner instead, if you can find it.
If your base lipstick was a lighter color, such as bright purple or pink, use a darker shade of the same color, such as plum (for purple) or maroon (for pink)., Gently sweep the brush across your lips, starting from the outer corner, and going inwards towards the center. Alternate between using the wider part of the brush on your lip, and the narrow part of the brush on the outline.
 You want your lips to be darker at the corners and brighter towards the center. This will give your lips a smoky, vampy look, perfect for nighttime.
 This look is already very pouty, but if you want to step things up a little add a dab of clear lip gloss to center of your upper and lower lip.

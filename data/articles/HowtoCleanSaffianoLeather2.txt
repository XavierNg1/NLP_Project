 Dab a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol. Pat the Saffiano leather with the cotton ball where you wish to clean it. Do not rub or wipe the cotton all across the leather’s surface or you might cause the color to rub off. After about 15 minutes, when the leather is dry, soak the cotton ball again and gently wipe the spot you previously dabbed.Add a small amount of hand cream to a cotton ball. Rub the cotton ball into the spot you’ve been cleaning.
Use a dry cotton ball to remove excess hand cream.
You can use this method to effectively remove ink from Saffiano leather, but instead of applying hand cream at the end, turn your blow dryer on the lowest setting and use it to dry the spot where you applied the alcohol.
 Mix cream of tartar and lemon juice in equal parts to make a paste. For instance, you might mix one tablespoon of lemon juice and one tablespoon of cream of tartar. Rub the paste on the stain and let it sit for 10 minutes. Remove the paste with a rag dampened with distilled water and moisturizing soap.Dry the leather with a dry, soft cloth or paper towel.
 If you have a serious stain that cannot be easily removed using any of the prior methods, you might need to turn to a specialized stain remover. These are readily available from many big box stores and online. For instance, if you have an ink stain that won’t come out, invest in an ink stain remover that is approved for use with Saffiano leather.Directions for using specialty stain removers vary. Consult manufacturer instructions before use.
 If you cannot clean your Saffiano leather properly even with the help of a specialty stain remover, take it to a specialist. You’ll have to shell out a bit extra, but at least you’ll have your Saffiano leather looking clean.

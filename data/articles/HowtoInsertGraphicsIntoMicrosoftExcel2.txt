In Excel 2003, select "Picture" from the Insert menu, then select "From File."
In Excel 2007 and 2010, select "Picture" from the Illustrations group on the Insert menu ribbon.
 Double click a folder to open it, or type the picture name in the "File name:" field. You can also use the drop-down field to the right of the "File name:" field to narrow the available pictures to a particular file type.
 Either click the "Insert" button or double-click the picture file.


When you insert a picture this way, it increases the overall size of your Excel file. You can instead insert a link to the picture by clicking the down arrow to the right of the "Insert" button and clicking "Link to File." If you later move the picture to a different location on your computer, however, the link will be broken and you will have to re-create the link to have the picture available again.

 If you do not have all three side lengths, you cannot use the Pythagorean Theorem to determine whether the triangle is right.

For example, you might be given a triangle with side lengths of 8, 9, and 12 cm, and you need to determine whether the triangle is right. 


, The formula is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where c{\displaystyle c} is the length of the hypotenuse, and a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are the lengths of the other sides of the triangle., The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle, so whatever measurement is largest will stand for the variable c{\displaystyle c}.

For example, if the side lengths of a triangle are are 8, 9, and 12 cm, you would use the measurement of 12 for the potential hypotenuse, because itâ€™s the longest side. So, your formula will look like this: a2+b2=122{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=12^{2}}.
 It does not matter which value is a{\displaystyle a} and which value is b{\displaystyle b}.

For example, if the other two side lengths are 8 and 9 centimeters, your formula will look like this: 82+92=122{\displaystyle 8^{2}+9^{2}=12^{2}}.
 Remember that squaring a number means to multiply it by itself.

For example:82+92=122{\displaystyle 8^{2}+9^{2}=12^{2}}64+81=144{\displaystyle 64+81=144}


, If this sum is equal to the square of the hypotenuse, the triangle is right. If the two sides of the equation are not equal, the triangle is not right.For example:64+81=144{\displaystyle 64+81=144}145=144{\displaystyle 145=144}Since the equation is not true, the triangle is not right.

 For example, if your card is 8.5 x 11 inches, then you will need at least a 12 x 12 inch piece of paper. For a small 4 x 5 inch card, a 7 x 7 inch piece of paper will work.
 The corners should face up and down, and right and left, like a diamond., This will create one crease going from the upper left to the bottom right corner and another crease going from the upper right to the bottom left corner. First, line up two of the opposing edges, crease, and then unfold. Repeat this for both the other corner, then unfold the edges so the paper lies flat in a diamond shape again.
 Touch the bottom corner to the point where both creases intersect in the middle of the paper. Then, crease the edge of the fold so the paper lies flat.
 Now, the paper will be triangular. The outer edges of the paper should line up almost perfectly. Smooth the fold so the paper lies flat.
 Fold the left edge of the triangle so the point goes slightly over the middle crease.
 The right corner of the triangle corner should overlap the crease, too.
 The right corner did not line up perfectly with the middle crease, so fold the overlapped point back slightly. The edge of the right corner should line up with the vertical crease. This will make a small triangle.
 When you stick your finger into the fold the of the small triangle, you will notice the small triangle naturally opens into a diamond shape. Spread and flatten the small triangle. The tiny diamond will have a crease down the center.
 Now, the envelope is finished! You can reopen the envelope to insert your card or letter, and close the top edge after it is inserted. You may want to secure any loose edges with tape if you have trouble keeping them shut.

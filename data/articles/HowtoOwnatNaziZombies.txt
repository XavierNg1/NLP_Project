, Getting swarmed by zombies can lead to death, so if you start to see a zombie swarm, chuck a grenade and run!

, Know that it might stink against zombies on later rounds.
 Don't reject guns you think are lame, as they might not. If you get the CZ75 dual wield, get it. It takes like 4 shots to kill zombies on like round 12.
 It increases your chance of living.
 For the pentagon thief, get your teammates to take out their worst gun same for you so you don't lose your best gun.

 Add Epsom salts or a mild soap to the water; this will clean the area. Soaking your toe will relieve pain and reduce redness. It will also soften the nail and skin around the ingrown toenail.Make sure the area is thoroughly dry before proceeding to the next step.
 Roll it until it forms a wick or a small roll. Then, push the skin growing over your nail down and away from your nail. Place the small cotton roll in between your skin and nail. This will keep your nail elevated, preventing it from growing further into your skin.Hold the roll in place by wrapping your toenail in medical gauze.
This part may be painful but it is necessary. You may take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or Tylenol to manage your pain.
You can apply a topical antibiotic such as Neosporin to further prevent an infection.
 Each time your soak your foot, you will need to change out the cotton roll. Each day, try to wedge the roll a little farther in. Repeat this process until your toenail has grown past the end of your toe. It may take one to two weeks for your nail to grow out.If you do not see any improvements or if an infection develops, you may need to contact your doctor.
You may need to wear sandals until your toe clears up.

 Before you can treat droopy eye, you need to get a diagnosis from a medical professional. Because droopy eyelids can be a sign of serious medical conditions, you should seek medical attention promptly. Your doctor should get a complete medical history and perform a physical exam to rule out serious neurological problems, infections, autoimmune disorders, and other diseases.

an eye exam to test visual acuity
a slit lamp test to check for corneal abrasions or scratches
a tension test to check for myasthenia gravis, a chronic autoimmune disease that causes muscle weakness;

 There are times when you should always care. When someone else is being hurt is probably the most important. It’s very reasonable to want to not care about people bullying you, but if you see people bullying someone else you should always care. If we stand up for each other then no one will ever have to get intentionally hurt like that, yourself included.
 You can’t kill people you don’t like, you can’t bully others, and you should always about how your words and actions hurt other people. If we want to live happily and peacefully in this world, we have to love and care for each other rather than driving hate with hate. If you don’t care that you’re hurting someone else, you need to think about how your actions are going to impact your life.
 Oftentimes, people will rely on you. You may not even known that they rely on you. There will be, throughout your life, people that need you for different reasons. You should care about them and you should care about yourself enough to do what you need to do to help them.


These can be friends that need your emotional support through hard times or family members who need your love to keep their lives bright. It might be a shelter where you volunteer or it might be your children who need you to survive.
 It is also extremely important for you to care about your own life and your own well-being. At times it can be hard, especially if you have had bad things happen to you, to understand why you should care about yourself. But when you feel down, remember that there are so many people who love you (even if you don’t know it) and your future has so many wonderful things in store for you (even if you don’t think good things will ever happen to you again). Be strong, because you are so strong, and just wait.

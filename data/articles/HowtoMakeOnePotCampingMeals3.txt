 For the skillet quiche, you’ll need a 10 ounce (284 g) package of frozen spinach that’s been thawed. Drain the spinach of any water, and squeeze the spinach with a clean towel to dry it. Set it aside for the moment., Add 2 eggs and ⅓ cup (42 g) of flour to a large bowl. Use a whisk to blend them together until the mixture is light and fluffy.You can use egg substitute in place of the eggs if you prefer.
 Once the eggs and flour are beaten together, add 2 cups (450 g) of cottage cheese and an 8 ounce (225 g) package of shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture. Blend well so the cheeses are fully incorporated.You can substitute shredded Swiss, mozzarella, Monterey jack, pepper jack, or your favorite cheese for the cheddar.
 After you’ve mixed in the cheeses, add the drained spinach and ½ cup (75 g) of finely chopped ham to the bowl. Gently fold them in until they are fully incorporated.You can add other vegetables to the quiche if you like. Peppers, tomatoes, and onions are tasty options.
You can substitute another cooked meat for the ham if you prefer. Bacon and pepperoni are good options.
 Place a skillet on your camping stove, and add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of vegetable oil. Allow the oil to heat on medium until it begins to shimmer, which should take 3 to 5 minutes.You can substitute olive oil or butter for the vegetable oil if you prefer.
 Once the oil is heated, add the egg mixture to the skillet. Make sure to spread it evenly across the pan., When the egg mixture is in the skillet, cover it. Reduce the heat to low, and allow the quiche to cook until the bottom is brown and crusty, which should take approximately 10 minutes.Make sure that the center of the quiche is set before you remove it from the heat.
 When the quiche is finished cooked, take the skillet off the heat. Allow it to cool for 5 minutes before cutting it into wedges and serving.

 Dab it dry with a soft clean towel.;
,,,, Barry M dazzle dust looks great when sprinkled over the eyes. It comes in over 60 colours, so you should be alright for choice! Mix colours (be sure to blend properly with a fine brush or your finger)if you wish.
 Eyeliner is great, but it can be tricky to apply. For this you need a steady hand, and a good sharp pencil eyeliner, or a liquid one. Be careful not to go over the top. Glitter eyeliner adds that extra little 'wow' into your face and makes you look like a partying babe.
 Use a normal black one or a coloured one. False eyelashes are also great if used correctly. Clear mascara adds definition to the eyebrows and the lashes.
 Lip paint (or lipstick) is great for a solid colour. For the extra gloss, add a clear lip gloss or sealant over the top. Sealant makes sure that the lipstick doesn't smudge. Gloss is great on it's own too, but you may have too keep applying it. Use lip liner if you want, but be careful not to change the shape of your lips, or go over the lip line.
 But only use three strips of it. One in the middle, then on either side. When that's dry, add another coat for a better, more solid colour.,

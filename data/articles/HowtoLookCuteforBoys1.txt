 Before someone can like you, you need to like yourself. When you look in the mirror, do you like what you see? If you do, that's great! If you don't, try pointing out things that you do like about yourself. You may have great hair, or maybe pretty eyes. Focus on the beautiful things, and expand on those.



Be Yourself. Never change who you are for someone else. Even if you feel like there's nothing special about you, there is something deep down inside that is beautiful. Let that blossom, and learn to accept who you are!

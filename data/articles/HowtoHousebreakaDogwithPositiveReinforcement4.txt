 Positive reinforcement does not rely on a system of punishment or fear. If your dog should have an accident, do not yell, physically harm, or otherwise punish the dog. Instead, think about why the accident may have occurred.Perhaps the dog cannot wait as long to use the potty.
Perhaps the dog had additional food or drink.
 If you catch the dog in the act of going potty inside, speak in a firm voice (or make a loud noise) that interrupts the action, and take the dog outside immediately.You might say, "Outside!"
You could also clap your hands or make another loud noise.
 If your dog should have an accident on the floor, it is crucial to clean this area thoroughly. Any remaining scent could encourage your dog to go potty in the same location again.Clean the area with hot water and detergent.
Follow with an enzyme-based cleaner created specifically for pet accidents (available at pet stores and online).

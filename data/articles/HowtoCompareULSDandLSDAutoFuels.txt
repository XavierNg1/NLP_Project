 ultra-low sulfur diesel is considered a cleaner burning type of diesel fuel because it has 97 percent less sulfur, which allows pollution control devices that used to be damaged by sulfur to be used more effectively to reduce emissions from the vehicle.;
, The year 2010 was the cut year for retailers to sell LSD, so the conversion should be fully implemented to strictly selling ultra-low sulfur diesel.
 ultra-low sulfur dieselD typically has a lighter appearance because of the refining process that was used to take out the sulfur. Because of the reduction in sulfur, it also tends to have less of an odor as compared to LSD.
 The refinement and distribution cost is more for ultra-low sulfur diesel than it was for LSD, so you should expect to pay more at the pump. Factors in this price increase include transportation costs, crude oil prices, weather factors and economic factors.
 You should, however, see no impact on your overall power when putting ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel in your vehicle instead of LSD fuel.
 When first introducing ultra-low sulfur diesel to your vehicle, you might loosen fuel tank deposits, so monitor your vehicle closely for plugged filters during your change over from LSD.
 While the higher sulfur content may have given your vehicle good lubricity, you should see no difference between ultra-low sulfur diesel and LSD because typically additives that both inhibit corrosion and increase lubricity are put in prior to the fuel being sold at a retail level. Additives such as these should give you performance as good as LSD fuel.

 Place your golf tee in the ground with some depth. Put your golf ball on the tee.


Use about half of the tees length.
Teeing too high or low will alter your drive.
 Stand so that your golf ball is only a few inches behind your left toe. Placing the ball here will result in less swing range and more control.


Setting the ball back further in your stance will diminish power.
Putting the ball further ahead in your stance will reduce accuracy.
 Stand just wider than shoulder width. Taking a narrow stance will constrict your range of motion and grant more control.


Don't take too short a stance as this will drastically alter your swing.
 Place your hands a bit lower down on the grip area of your club, away from the clubs end. Gripping down further on the club will give you more control over its movement as you swing.Low grips will trade power for accuracy.
Keep your hands and wrists as straight as you can.
 Keep your weight distributed evenly, shifting only slightly to your right foot. Keep your head and torso straight and centered with the ball.


Bring the club back at a moderate speed.
 Send the club down, swinging towards your ball. Strike the ball slightly under its center and with the mid point of your swing.


Make sure you strike the ball with the club face flat.Swing strongly, but don't overdo it.

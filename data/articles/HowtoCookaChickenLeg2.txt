 To prepare the stock, finely chop the leek, onion, and garlic. Then, place the stock pot on the burner until medium-low heat and add the olive oil to the pot. Then, place the chopped ingredients into the pot and sweat them out. Then, add the chopped carrots, celery, and bay leaf and chicken stock to the pot., As it simmers, add salt and pepper to taste. Then, reduce the heat so between 170 - 180 ºF (76 - 82 ºC).
 Gently move the chicken around in the liquid if pieces of chicken are touching each other. You do not want raw sides, and you do not want to have a funny piece of chicken, set in a rough shape from another piece of chicken squashing it while it was cooking.
 Make sure the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165º F (74º C) before you eat it. When it's done, place it on a plate and let it cool for 5-10 minutes.
 Enjoy this poached chicken on its own or with a side of veggies or mashed potatoes.

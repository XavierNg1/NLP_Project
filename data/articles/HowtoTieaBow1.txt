 The technique for tying a basic bow is the same no matter what type of ribbon you use and for what purpose you are using it. You just need a ribbon with a left end and a right end stemming from the same knotted center.


If you're tying a bow on the top of a package, loop the ribbon under the package, bring the ends together over the package and knot the two ends together so the ends are equal in length. You now have a right side and a left side to work with.
You can tie a bow from a piece of ribbon that isn't attached to a package. Tie a knot in the center of the ribbon so the left and right sides are equal in length.

, Pinch the loop between your thumb and forefinger to hold it in place. If you're tying a ribbon, make sure that it isn't twisted; the loop should be smooth.
 This time bring the right side of the ribbon around and under the left loop. Pull it through until you have a second loop of the exact same size. Use the same technique you use when you tie your shoes.
 Pull on the loops to tighten the knot at their center. Make sure the two loops are the same size and that the ends are even in length. The bow is complete.

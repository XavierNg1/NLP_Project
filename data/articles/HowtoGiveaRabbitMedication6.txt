 If your rabbit has incurred an injury, you may need to apply cream (or gel) to the wound. Before you apply a cream or gel medication to a wound, the area must be cleaned.


Wash your hands with soap and water.
Hold rabbit still with your non-dominant hand (it may help if someone is there to assist you.) #*Clean the area using a cotton pad and antiseptic.
 If the rabbitâ€™s fur is getting into the wound, you may need to trim a bit of it away. This reduces irritation and helps the wound to remain free of bacteria. Use a pair of sharp scissors to carefully remove any excess fur.


Wash your hands, if you haven't already.
Hold rabbit still with your non-dominant hand. (Once again, have someone help you , if possible.)
Use sharp scissors to trim away the fur around the wound.
 Locate instructions on the bottle of cream, on the packaging, or on any materials you received from the vet. This should tell you exactly how much cream you should apply, as well as how often.
 Administer the cream, moving from the center of the wound to the edge of wound. This helps avoid bringing germs from the fur to the wound.Once again, you will need to help the rabbit still with your non-dominant arm. Use your other hand to apply the cream.

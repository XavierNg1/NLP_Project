 This is easily the best way to find the right buyer. Pursue paid advertising if you’re willing to foot the cost. If you would rather stick with free sites, you should have no trouble getting your ad posted on high-traffic classified sites.
 Holding an auction for a used piano may not yield the best results, but listing it for immediate purchase may generate a few nibbles. You should have at least one detailed photo if you decide to pursue this route.
 Providing links to your listings on popular social media sites can increase the amount of traffic to your posting. But don’t overdo it. Badgering people on your social network can cost you friends and strain relationships.

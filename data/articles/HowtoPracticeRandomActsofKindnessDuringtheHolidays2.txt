 When weather strikes, reporters are out there in the middle of it, including snowstorms and blizzards. If you spot them, give out hot drinks or snacks as a token of appreciation for what they do.
 See what kinds of nonperishable foods they are in need of.
 Look for a local humane society and call or browse their website for a "wish list". These lists are items the business is in need of. Supplies can include:


Different types of food for various animals, such as cat food, dog treats, birdseed, etc.
Household cleaners and items, such as paper towels, bleach, garbage bags, etc.
 Research on local organizations and learn about their requirements, as they may take toys in certain conditions (unopened or in good value).
 While it is snowing and you are warm inside, your mail is still being delivered to you. Attach a candy cane to your mailbox for them or give them a tip when they come by.

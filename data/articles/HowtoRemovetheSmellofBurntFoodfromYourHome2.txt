 Put a pot of water to boil on the stove. Cut a lemon into multiple slices. Put the lemon slices into the boiling water and let sit for 10-30 minutes to freshen up the house.


As an alternative, steep a handful of hot cloves in the water instead of lemon slices.
 Cut up an onion. Put the onion slices into a bowl of water and place the bowl of onion water in the middle of the kitchen. If your entire house smells bad, consider placing bowls of onion water in different locations of the house. Let the bowls sit overnight to absorb the odors.
 Use bread and vinegar to absorb the smell. Fill a saucepan with water and add 2 cups of vinegar. Bring the vinegar water to a boil, then allow to simmer for 15 minutes. Take some bread and dip it in the vinegar water. Put the bread on a plate and let it absorb the odors.You can simply put out bowls of vinegar to absorb the odors. Heat the vinegar to make it more effective.
 Baking soda is a powerful odor absorbent, especially for kitchen smells. To clear the burned smell, put about four ounces (118.29 mL) of baking soda into bowls. Distribute the bowls around your kitchen and other areas of your home to absorb the smell.

 Yellow blush isnâ€™t a product yet. To get this effect, try yellow eyeshadow. Many different makeup companies sell yellow shades, often under the name of neon.Some companies put out yellow shades like buttercup or golden. Others may be under names like sunshine.;
, Yellow lipstick is another product you can use to make yellow blush. Start with a satin or matte lipstick. Get a decent amount of yellow lipstick onto your fingers. Warm the lipstick between your fingers by rubbing them together. Apply it just like you would with a brush.Other lipstick finishes can be used if you want to experiment with shade and the finish on your cheeks.
You can also use a foundation brush if you want instead of your fingers.
 You can alter the shade of the yellow blush to achieve something more golden or even orange. Take yellow lipstick or eyeshadow and mix with a red, peach, or pink toned blush. Experiment mixing these colors to make your own golden shade., Do all the rest of your makeup before you apply the blush. Make sure you have already applied your foundation, moisturizer, concealer, highlighter, or powder. The blush should be the last thing you do.
 Yellow blush is applied with a technique called draping. To do this, start your blush at the outer corner of your cheekbone and temple. Then, apply the shade down to the apple of your cheek.

 There are only so many commitments you can make and keep as a parent.


Be selective about the projects you agree to help others with. For example, volunteer to help with one PTA event instead of all of them.
Limit the activities of your kids as well. Children tend to be over scheduled today, which can increase their stress as well as yours. Instead of playing 3 sports in a season, ask each child to pick 1 sport or activity to dedicate themselves to.;
, If you are a working parent, protect your lunch hour as your own and spend it reading, walking or doing something else you enjoy. If you are at home with your kids all day, spend their nap times on yourself.
 If you are married or in a relationship, your other half is probably feeling some parenting stress as well.


Schedule a date night once a week, or if you cannot get out, watch a movie together once the kids are in bed.
 While 8 hours of sleep per night may seem impossible, not sleeping enough can increase your stress levels. Set a bedtime rule for your kids and yourself.

 Having to rush around to get ready in the morning does not start your day on a good note. In fact, you may end up having extra stress first thing in the morning because you have to rush. If you often find yourself rushing or running late, you may need to start waking up a bit earlier to give yourself more time to get ready. Try setting your alarm for 15 minutes before your normal wake-up time to see how it changes your morning routine.
 Even if you are in a hurry in the morning, taking a few moments to connect with your family or friends can help get your day off to a great start. Simply taking a second to give your family members a hug and say “I love you,” or tell your roommate to have a good day can be beneficial. A twenty second hug in the morning can help your body to release dopamine and oxytocin, which will make you feel good and help relieve stress., Your brain is more capable of handling difficult tasks first thing in the morning, so it’s best to use your early morning time to focus on important projects, rather than on menial tasks like answering emails. You are also less likely to be interrupted by your loved ones or coworkers early in the morning. As the day goes on, you can shift to working on things that are easier or less important., In order to have a relaxing start to your day, you may need to set aside some time to meditate or pray. Taking about 5-10 minutes to sit quietly with your thoughts and breathe will help set a relaxing tone for your day. If you have a lot on your plate, taking time to meditate or pray can also help to alleviate some of your stress and anxiety about being able to complete everything.

 One of the best ways to relieve the pain of plantar fasciitis is to rest it. This means staying off of it as much as you can. When you are home or at work, try to stay seated and only walk on it if you have to. You might consider using crutches for a few days to take all pressure off the foot.If you usually do exercises that use your foot, consider doing something different, like swimming or weight lifting.;
, An arch support can help distribute the pressure of your foot in an even way, which can take the extra stress off your plantar fascia. You can also use a heel cup. You can get an arch support without a prescription at many drug stores, medical supply stores, and pharmacies.


These foot supports go inside your shoes.
Examples of arch supports that come with a soft cushion are Spenco and Cross Trainers. For some people, a custom-made support may be needed. These can be acquired through your doctor.
 Ice is helpful with plantar fasciitis pain because it works to reduce inflammation. You can use an ice pack on the bottom of your foot for 20 minutes three to four times a day. You can also try using an ice bath, which is where you soak your foot in an ice and water mixture for about ten to fifteen minutes.Make sure to place a cloth or towel between the ice pack and your skin.
Heat generally doesn’t help plantar fasciitis pain, but if the ice doesn’t help, you can try a heating pad after a couple days to see if it will relieve pain.

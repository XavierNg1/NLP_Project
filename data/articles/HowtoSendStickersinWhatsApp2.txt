 Since WhatsApp doesn't have sticker support, you'll actually be sending regular image files instead. You can find image files for stickers online, and then save these to send as stickers in WhatsApp.


WhatsApp does have animated stickers. The image will send, but only the first frame will be shown.
 You can send any image using WhatsApp, so if you find something online that you think would make a good sticker, you can use it. You can save images from any website if you feel it would be a good sticker.
 Once you've found an image that you want to use, press and hold on it to open the image menu. Select "Save Image" to save the image to your device's Photos or Gallery app.
 Tap the "Attach" button on the conversation screen and browse through the images stored on your device. The image that you saved may be in an album called "Downloads".
 The smaller the image is, the more sticker-like it will appear to be.

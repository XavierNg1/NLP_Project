 Determine if confronting someone will accomplish anything, or if it is not worth the energy. If the problem seems like it’s a one-time occurrence, it may be worth overlooking it, especially if it’s minor., If you’re noticing a problem that is festering, nip it in the bud before it grows into a full-fledged conflict.Addressing a problem earlier will reduce longer-term stress and potential fallout from the conflict.


For example, if you see two of your employees constantly bickering, bring each one individually into your office to get to the root of the arguments.
 Skip blaming your coworkers or clients for problems that cause conflict. Instead, use neutral language that expresses your viewpoint, which is more respectful and professional than accusing others.For example, say, “I get frustrated when I am unable to complete the next phase of the project that others have missed deadlines for.”

, Maintain a professional attitude and take deep breaths to stay calm. Don’t resort to name-calling or accusations. Even if the other person is engaging in this behavior, demonstrate your professionalism by rising above it., If you aren’t communicating well with your supervisor or coworkers, stressful situations can intensify. Schedule a brief meeting with the person to talk about your issue. Be positive and offer solutions that will be helpful to all parties.

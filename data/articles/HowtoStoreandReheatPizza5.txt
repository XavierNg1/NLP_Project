 The trick to minimize burning is to reheat the pizza for a short time. Don't reheat too long. Expect this method to produce a slightly soggy pizza. The pizza will be tasty, but its texture won't be splendid.
 The water in the cup will prevent the microwaves from reaching deep inside the pizza slice, while letting the cheese melt and reheat the crust.
Reheat for 30 seconds.
In 30 seconds, your crispy, delicious pizza slice will be ready to eat!

 Pay attention to the whole game, don't drift in and out. Decide which player you like the most by watching the plays he makes on the field and his interviews after the game (their personality is important too!).;
, This can help you hold your own in conversations with even lifelong die-hards.
, This can result in a sharing of enthusiasm about the team, or during the club's more worse hours: a shared sorrow. Regardless of which feeling it is, it is better to not go through it alone.
 Tickets can be purchased directly from the Mets online, at the stadium box office in person, or from a secondhand ticket seller such as StubHub.


Getting to a game can be a great way to spend time with Mets fan friends you have, or to meet new friends who support the Mets!

, Don't be the guy or girl that talks about their love for the Mets but doesn't know who David Wright is. Go to mets.com or a similar site, and look up the current roster. For the key players, know some crucial tidbits (name, position, basic stats) to help you hold your own in conversations about the team.
, See the team whenever you can. If you live in the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, you may have the chance to relatively easily see the Mets in cities such as Philadelphia, Washington DC, Boston, and Baltimore. Take advantage of these opportunities if they come about.
 Don't be the guy shouting on Twitter about how the Mets ABSOLUTELY MUST TRADE players x, y, and z after said players came up short. Be rational.
 Put up Mets paraphernalia around the home and office. Throw some Mets items into your wardrobe (Mets jackets for the winter months can be purchased online and offer a stylish way to show your team pride year-round).

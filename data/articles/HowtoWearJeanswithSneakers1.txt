 Just as the name suggests, boot cut jeans are made to wear with boots! The wider cut at the bottom will swallow up your high top shoes, covering them almost completely and making showing them off impossible. The flared bottom will also more than likely graze the ground, causing your jeans to become frayed and ripped. The result is a sloppy overall look.

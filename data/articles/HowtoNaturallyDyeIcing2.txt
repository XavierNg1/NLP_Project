 If you are making your own icing, you should put all ingredients except for the water or milk in the recipe in a mixing bowl. The water or milk in the recipe will be replaced with your juice. If you don’t have a recipe for icing, you might use one of the following:


Mix one cup confectioner’s sugar, one tablespoon dried egg whites, ½ teaspoon corn syrup, and ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract together in a mixing bowl. You will add two to four tablespoons of natural dye to this recipe.If you don’t like using corn syrup, you can mix one cup of confectioner’s sugar and one teaspoon of brown rice syrup for a similar icing. You will add three teaspoons of natural dye to this recipe.If you are making a frosting instead of an icing, the same principle applies. Replace any water or milk in the recipe with natural dye instead.
 Use the same amount of vegetable juice that you would use water or milk. For example, if the recipe calls for two tablespoons of water, use two tablespoons of juice instead.


If you have bought a store-bought icing, you should not use this method. You will have to boil the juice down into a syrup to avoid diluting the icing.
 Using a whisk, fork, or hand blender, mix the icing with the juice. Stir until the color is completely mixed in and all white streaks have disappeared from the icing. If you want a deeper color, add more dye.


It is better to start with a small amount of dye and add more as you need than to add too much at the beginning. You can always add dye, but you can’t remove dye.
Be careful when adding more liquid dye, as too much liquid can make your icing runny or watery.

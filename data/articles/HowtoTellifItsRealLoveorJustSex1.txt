 Signs of lust might include focusing on each other’s appearance, having a relationships that revolves around sex, and little interest in having real conversations and getting to know the other person. Having a relationship based entirely on sexual attraction can work for a while, but things can become complicated if one partner feels love for the other while the other only feels lust.
 Love is usually coupled with sexual attraction, but love goes deeper. Think about whether you and the other person have long and deep conversations to really get to know each other and if you value each other’s happiness. Analyze if you want to be part of that person’s life by getting to know friends and family, and whether you feel romantic attachment to that person. Do you share similar values and interests? Do you feel a deep connection to that person?

Some qualities you might find in a suitable partner include:A commitment to personal growth and becoming a better person.
An awareness of his or her own baggage or weaknesses.
Emotional openness.
Responsible and respectful.
Integrity; he or she practices honesty with you, him or herself, and others.
Loves because he or she feels good about him or herself, not in order to feel good about him or herself.
 Lust and romantic love are two of three brain systems that help explain universal human attitudes toward mating and reproduction. Sexual attraction, romantic love, and long-term feelings of attachment work together in different proportions to create feelings of love in a relationship.
 Try to find events that you would both enjoy. If it’s easy to find things that you love to do together, you might be on the way to love. If you have trouble finding anything to do together that doesn’t revolve around sex or the promise of sex, it’s a good guess that you’re just experiencing sexual attraction.

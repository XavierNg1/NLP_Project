 You can copy links from web browsers, emails, and many other apps. Links may be traditional text links or may be a picture.


The process for this is very similar regardless of what type of mobile device you're using (Android, iPhone, iPad, Windows mobile, etc.)

, Once you've found the link, press and hold it until a new menu appears. It may take a few moments for the menu to show up., The wording for this will vary depending on the app you are using. Look for wording similar to these examples:


Copy
Copy link address
Copy link URL
Copy address

, Once you've copied the link, you can paste it anywhere you can type. Tap the text field to place your cursor.
 Release your finger after a moment. A new menu will appear.


If you're using an iOS device (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch), release your finger once the magnifier lens appears.
If you're using an Android device, release your finger when the indicator under the cursor appears.
 You'll see the "Paste" option in the menu that appears. Tapping "Paste" will paste the copied address into the text field.
 If you've received a text message with a link on your Android device, you may have to do a little more work to copy it, especially if there is other text with it. Not all Android messaging apps will function the same:


Press and hold on the message that contains the link.
Tap the "Copy" button that appears. It may just be an icon of two pages stacked on each other at the top of the screen.
Paste the copied text where you want to paste the link, and then manually delete any extra text that came with the original message.

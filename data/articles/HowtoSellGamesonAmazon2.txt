 Without having an account, you are not allowed to sell anything on Amazon.


You can sell your used games on Amazon either by selling your used video games to others for any price, or selling your games at a set price using Amazon’s trade-in service system. Both methods are easy enough with these steps.
 You must meet the Amazon’s official requirements for selling your used games, such as good functional condition, having few scratches, successful running capacity, and good packaging.
 Before finalizing the price of your used games, check other game-selling sites, and their usual prices to get the maximum price of your games. Generally, Amazon at present offers the highest rate compared to other sites.
 Search games at the Amazon trade-in section, and submit your selected trade-in. Categorize your product as a “collectible.” You must then put your address there.


At this point, you need to print out your free UPS shipping label generated by Amazon website, and send it off to Amazon. Remember, your submission may take up to maximum 10 days to arrive. However, it has a free shipping feature offered by Amazon.
 The most important task you need to do is to ensure proper shipping after selling your games. Choose sturdy boxes or cover for your games, and pack each one properly to avoid any damage.


Make sure that your pre-paid U.S. Postal Service shipping label for a sold game is printed correctly to avoid any possible issue. You incur no shipping cost for shipping trade-in items.
 Check your Amazon account,and be sure that your account is credited.

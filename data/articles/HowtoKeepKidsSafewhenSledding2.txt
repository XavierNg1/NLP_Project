 Always make sure your children have on helmets. This protects them if they fall off or collide with something. All children under 12 should wear a fitted helmet.Make sure the helmet is designed for winter sports. You can use a helmet intended for skateboards or bicycles, but winter sports helmets are ideal., When your kids are sledding, they are spending an extended amount of time outside in cold temperatures. To help keep them from getting frostbite or hypothermia, make sure they are wearing layers.These layers include a winter jacket, hat, socks, gloves, and boots.


Consider dressing children in one layer more than an adult would wear.
The inner layer should be thin and a material to wick away moisture. This layer shouldnâ€™t be cotton, which will hold sweat and be damp against the skin. You need two middle layers, like a long-sleeved shirt and leggings that are slightly loose to trap insulating air. Then the other layer should be a waterproof jacket.These layers should be waterproof. It is important that children remove any wet clothes immediately, since this is one of the most common ways they can get hypothermia., Make sure your children are wearing clothing that has no strings or loose parts. This includes scarves. Any loose bits of clothing poses strangulation risks since they can get caught in the sled.If you want your child to wear a scarf, make sure it is inside the coat. Or try alternatives like neck gaiters or masks.
 Make sure your kids have boots that fit (remember that last year's boots may be too small this year), have traction, and will keep feet warm and dry. Oversize boots won't support ankles and may allow snow to get into the boots.If your children are wearing inappropriate shoes or don't have snow boots, you can cover their socks with plastic bags to keep feet dry in a pinch.

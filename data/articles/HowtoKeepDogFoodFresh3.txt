 If you make your own food for your dog, make it in small batches or portions. This prevents older food from becoming stale or rotten.If you have the ability, make your dog’s food fresh daily. Otherwise, prepare food for no more than three days at a time.
 Whether you use raw or cooked food, if you make your dog’s meals ahead of time, refrigerate the food to keep it fresh. If you make more than three day’s worth of food at a time, freeze excess food as individual servings.For ease in serving, refrigerate individual portions of food at a time.
Always freeze individual portions, as constant thawing and refreezing could damage fresh food.
 Whether you are storing in the fridge or the freezer, try to use air-tight, freezer-safe containers for all servings of homemade dog food. This offers greater protection than plastic bags for your dog’s food.Find freezer-safe, air-tight storage containers at your local grocery store, storage and organization store, or from an online merchant.
Always wash a container with soap and hot water between uses.

 If your boyfriend or girlfriend wants to be around you, and is always gracefully touching your arm, hand, or is always standing really close it could mean they have a kiss on their mind. If you feel the same way, then just act similarly. They might lean in closer to you when you are sitting alone, or they might even fix your hair, this can also be a sign that they want to kiss you, just lean in a little closer.;
, If your partner try to French Kiss you, and you don't want to, then just tell them. Your first young kiss shouldn't really be a French kiss anyway. When you're young it should probably be a small peck, not really anything more because it may make them feel uncomfortable, you aren't trying to make your first kiss a make out session.
 If you aren't sure, ask subtly "Have you ever kissed anyone?", and if they say no, ask "Do you want to kiss anyone?" And if they respond with a yes slowly lean in for a kiss but if they look uncomfortable stop an apologize.
 When your partner wants to stop slowly move away. Look into their eyes and smile when the kiss is over to let them know you enjoyed kissing them.

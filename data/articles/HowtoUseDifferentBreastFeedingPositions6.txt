 Maternity nurses receive some training in breast feeding and will be able to offer advice and guidance.
 Many hospitals have lactation specialists on staff to assist nursing mothers with any breast feeding issues that may arise during the hospital stay. Before leaving the hospital, be sure to take the lactation specialistâ€™s contact information with you so that you can call with any breast feeding questions that arise when you are at home.

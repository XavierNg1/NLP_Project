 Pick up the ear climber and locate its long, curved post. Place the tip of the post through your piercing and continue threading the post completely through your piercing., Once you thread the ear climberâ€™s post all the way through your piercing, flip the ear climber up. Flip the ear climber into the desired position. Your earlobe should be gripped between the post and the front of the ear climber., Gently squeeze the base of the ear climber with your forefinger and thumb. The ear climber should feel secure, but it should not be pinching your earlobe.

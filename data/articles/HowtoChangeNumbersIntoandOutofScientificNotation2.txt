 If the exponent on the "x 10" part of the number is positive, then you will be moving the decimal places to the right; if the exponent is negative, you will be moving the decimal places to the left.
 In the case of the number 5.2081 x 1012, you will be moving the decimal point over five spaces to the right. If the exponent is a -7, you move left seven places; if the exponent is a 5, move right five places.
 You may have to add them in front of or behind the number, depending on whether you are moving left or right. If you're moving the decimal point over 12 spaces to the right from the number 5.2081, then the new number becomes 5208100000000.
, Go through the digits, from right to left, putting a comma in front of every group of three digits. For example, 5208100000000 becomes 5,208,100,000,000.

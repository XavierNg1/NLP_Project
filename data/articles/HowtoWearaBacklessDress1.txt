 These bras have a band that wraps around your stomach, providing your chest with an ample amount of support. If you have a well-endowed bust, this is definitely the option you should consider first.;
, If you have a small bust, you might be able to get away without wearing any support. You should still smooth out the curve of your breast to prevent anything from showing through thin fabric, however. Accomplish this by sticking specialized gel petals over your nipples.
 It provides a little more coverage and support than gel petals, but less than a low-back bra. This option works best for women with small to moderately sized busts, but may still cause problems for those who need heavy-duty support.
 Some backless dresses go around the neck and only expose a small portion of your back. For these dresses, you may be able to hide a halter style bra beneath your dress. This is another supportive option for well-endowed women.

 If a mouse has a large infestation of pinworms in the intestines, the mouse may have diarrhea. This is caused from intestinal inflammation due to the pinworms.If the infection is really bad, the mouse may also have a rectal prolapse due to straining or anal irritation. They may also have sticky or hard to pass stools.
The mouse may also have poor growth, poor overall bodily health, or a poor coat.;
, You may be able to identify adult pinworms in the fecal pellets from your mouse. Pinworms are clear to white in color with a long, thin, hair like shape.The pinworms may be too small for you to see with the naked eye.
 Pinworms are spread through oral contact with contaminated feces. Pinworms are passed through feces, and anything that the feces touches may get infected with pinworms.Pinworms in feces may also float in the air; therefore, the pinworms may end up in the surrounding area around the mouseâ€™s cage.If your mouse has been near any surfaces that were contaminated or has come in contact with feces from an infected animal, they may have pinworms.

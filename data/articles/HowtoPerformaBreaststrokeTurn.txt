 Don't short stroke yourself. Keep your head down and look at the bottom of the pool. You should be ready for your fingers to touch the wall.;
, This will send your feet flying up into your chest.
 If you need to breathe, you can do it here as your head comes out only for a little. Then, dive your head back into the water.
 Make sure you're about a foot below the surface for maximum streamlining.
 This is the last part of the turn - the pullout. Then, do a small dolphin kick - move your legs like a dolphin or mermaid would. Now, you're allowed one more breaststroke kick to return to the surface, so do a normal stroke with the arms, then legs to get back above the water.

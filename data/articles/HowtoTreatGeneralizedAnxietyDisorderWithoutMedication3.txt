 Exercise and physical movement has been proven to be one of the most effective anxiety-reducing strategies. Exercise helps to relieve stress and tension, along with releasing endorphins and serotonin. Exercise also physically changes the brain so that it becomes more resistant to anxiety. You should do at least 30 to 45 minutes of activity each day.Try to do exercise that works your whole body, like walking, running, dancing, or swimming.
 Caffeine is a stimulant that can aggravate your anxiety. It can interfere with your sleep and increase your pulse. These things can increase your stress and make you feel more worn down. Try to reduce the amount of caffeine you drink or eliminate it from your diet completely.

Replace coffee, tea, and sodas with decaf versions, herbal teas, seltzer waters, or regular water.
 Smoking and alcohol can negatively affect your anxiety. Alcohol and other sedatives can make your anxiety worse. The nicotine found in cigarettes is a stimulant that affects your body like caffeine. Try eliminating these things from your diet completely.If you have trouble with this, find a support group or talk to your doctor about getting help.
 Insomnia is a common symptom of generalized anxiety disorder. Not getting enough sleep can cause anxiety, too. Not enough sleep makes you more vulnerable to stress and anxiety and lowers your ability to deal with things in a healthy manner.

 Planting tall, lush trees can turn your property into a slice of paradise while providing privacy, shade and protection from runoff and erosion. Many different types of trees can be grown easily in a variety of climate conditions and require little maintenance once theyâ€™re fully developed. They also make prime habitats for a diversity of local flora and fauna, restoring a natural balance to the surrounding environment.A few tree species that make excellent living fence options include oak, sugar maple, willow and green giant arborvitae.Keep an eye out for scavengers if you decide to line your property with fruit trees. Squirrels, birds and raccoons are just a few of the animals known for stealing fruit right off the branch.
 Once you have an idea of what tree species to go with and where to plant them, go around and dig holes at regular distances along the boundary line you've decided on. Trees should be planted a few feet apart to give them plenty of room to grow and keep them from strangling one another. After replacing the topsoil, cover it with a thin layer of mulch.Spreading a layer of mulch at the base of your trees will help deliver vital nutrients to the maturing roots and protect the trees from dehydration and damage.
Timely application of nitrogen-rich fertilizers can also help you grow a healthy treeline much faster., Natural rainfall will take care of the tree's moisture needs once they're developed, but while they're still growing it will be important to water them frequently. Because of their size and rate of development, trees typically need copious amounts of water. Soak the soil around the trunk until the water just begins to collect on the surface.Overwatering trees can cause them to weaken and die. You only need enough water to thoroughly moisten the soil around the trunk to a depth of a few inches. Avoid the temptation to water trees until the soil is saturated and soggy.

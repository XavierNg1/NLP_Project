 Hurting your friends is a bad idea. Once you realize that your attacker is trying to hurt you, go ahead and fight back.;
, Do this by entering a squatting position. Once you have accomplished this, it will be much harder to move you around and you will have bought yourself some time.
 If they are not free, go directly to the next step. If they are, skip the next one and read the one after it.
 Do anything to get free. Some suggestions are stomping on the feet and hitting (not grabbing) the groin. Once your arms are slightly loose, hit the opponent with repetitive elbows to anything you can reach. Skip the next two steps.
 Crotch slapping is less effective because of the relative positions of your arms. Chances are, the attacker won't let go. If, however, you are released, skip the next step. If the attacker does not let go, however, then you may go on to the next step. Be careful when doing it, as it will cause extreme pain and lasting damage.
 The assortment of weak bones in the back of the hand makes this unbearably painful. Now, take the index and middle fingers and pivot as you pull them back unnaturally. They should break. Now kick while shoving the finger back in hard and maintaining your distance.
 After you have freed yourself, don't stop fighting. Keep attacking until your opponent is unable to fight back or threaten you in any way. The only thing worse than not defending yourself is defending yourself poorly or half-way.

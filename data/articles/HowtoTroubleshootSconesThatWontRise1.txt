Consider using a little bit more baking soda in your next batch.;
, Baking soda and baking powder may sound similar enough to use interchangeably, but they are really two different things when it comes to baking. If the recipe calls for baking powder, make sure that you are using that and not baking soda and vise-versa.
 Ideal scone dough is wet and somewhat sticky. If the dough is too dry, the scones won't rise and will be crumbly. On the other hand, if the scones are too wet, they won't rise either, and will be too tough and chewy once baked. Don't hesitate to tweak the amounts and proportions to get the right texture. Things like temperature and humidity can affect a recipe and its ingredients.
 Accidentally using all-purpose (plain) flour in place of self-rising (self-raising) flour or not adding the rising agent to plain flour can cause flat scones.
 This includes things like yeast, baking soda, and baking powder. Over time, these ingredients lose their effectiveness, and will prevent your scones from rising. Here's a few ways you can tell if your baking soda and baking powder are fresh:Add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to a few tablespoons of distilled vinegar in a cup. If the mixture fizzes, the baking soda is fresh.
Add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder to a few tablespoons of warm water in a cup. If the mixture fizzes, the baking powder is fresh.
 If your butter was too warm, it could be a reason as to why your scones did not rise. Try using cold butter next time. The cold butter will melt while you bake the scones, and the steam it releases will help the scones rise.

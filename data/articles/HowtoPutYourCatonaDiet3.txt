 These diets work by stimulating your cat’s metabolism to work harder and burn fat, while protecting your cat’s lean muscle. Researchers found that lean cats have genes coding for a higher metabolic rate, and in turn discovered certain foods’ molecules are more likely to switch these genes on more than others.In contrast, research showed that calorie-restricting diets turned these genes off, making it more difficult for some cats to lose weight., If your cat cannot seem to lose weight on a reduced-calorie diet—or has hit a plateau in her weight loss prior to her target weight—then ask your vet about a metabolic diet for your cat.


Hills is the main producer of metabolic formula diets. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions based on your cat’s target weight.
 Another metabolic diet option for your cat is the “catkins” diet, which is a low-carb, high-protein diet that works especially well for overweight cats that have developed feline diabetes.One study showed that 68 percent of diabetic cats on the “catkins” diet were able to come off insulin as compared to 40 percent of those on a standard, high-fiber weight loss diet.Your veterinarian will test for feline diabetes in your overweight cat and discuss this option with you.
Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for your cat’s target weight for a high-protein, low-carb weight loss formula food.

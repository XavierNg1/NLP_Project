 Train teachers to address inappropriate comments by students. Use the resources offered by your Title IV coordinator to train staff and disseminate information among all employees of the school. With teachers and your title IV administrator, create guidelines for students to recognize and report harassment on campus.


Include these guidelines in the student handbook, and have guest speakers visit classes.
Get parents involved. Hold after-school meetings to educate parents about sexual harassment and its harmful effects.
Reward student assertiveness. Encourage students to speak up when they experience or witness sexual harassment. Take any complainant seriously.
Take seriously complaints about teachers in sexually harassing students.
 Along with taking the measures suggested for workplace and high school harassment prevention, students should be educated about their rights. Students should file a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights if their harassment is not being taken seriously by administrators, or if they are forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to report harassment., Sexual harassment is any unwanted sexual or sex-discriminatory behavior. It doesn't just happen in the workplace.It can come from friends, partners, and exes. If any of your friends make unwanted sexist or sexual comments about you or your other friends, tell them to stop.


Explain how you feel to your other friends. Listen to how they feel.
If your friends persist in disrespecting you, refuse to hang out with them.

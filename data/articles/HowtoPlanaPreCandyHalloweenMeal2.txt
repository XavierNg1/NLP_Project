 Whole grain pasta with a vegetable tomato sauce can be an easy, healthy, and especially filling Halloween meal. Look for a low-sugar, low-sodium tomato sauce, and add plenty of onions, mushrooms, and peppers.Grilling the peppers skin-side down, then peeling the skin off and slicing the pepper’s flesh into thin, finger-like strips can make for some worm-like surprises.
There’s even white whole grain pasta if anyone in the family needs to be fooled.
Fennel, garlic, and chilies are great seasoning options. As you mix these and the vegetables into the tomato sauce and begin to heat it, remove a few spoonfuls to add back in once the sauce has thickened, along with some fresh basil.
 Soups and chili with lots of beans and veggies are another great source of fiber. Black or kidney beans are especially filling and nutritious. Peas, green beans, sliced carrots, and fresh tomatoes are great veggie add-ins.You can get away with a bit of extra lean ground chuck to add protein and flavor. This will not only fill everyone up, it’ll keep them energized for trick-or-treating as well.Cut a small hole into some miniature onions and squeeze individual peas into them. Float a few of these edible eyeballs on the chili’s surface.
 Chicken pot pies can be a warm, filling, and fun Halloween meal. Get a rotisserie chicken, remove the skin, and shred the meat. Gather the veggies you’ll use as well - carrots and peas will go especially well.Specifics are up to you, especially in terms of the crust. You could always purchase a pre-made crust, or bake your own. An especially easy option is baking individual crusts in a muffin tin, and topping the biscuit-like crusts with a chicken and veggie gravy.
Use a bunch of turmeric to turn gravy or filling into a spooky orange goo.
Remember to use whole grain flour if baking anything yourself, and low-sodium chicken broth for gravy or filling.

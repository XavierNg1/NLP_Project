 Favors are a way to thank your guests for attending your wedding. They also can add to the d√©cor of your reception when placed on the guest tables.


Consider miniature beach pails filled with candy. Fill small galvanized pails with your favorite candy or beach-theme candies, such as salt water taffy or candy pebbles.
Provide miniature beach items. Give your guests small versions of popular beach items, such as flip flop key chains, sailboat note pads or sun-shaped bag tags.
Give your guests customized water bottles, beach towels or flip flops. Create water bottle labels with the names of the bride and groom and wedding date. Provide inexpensive flip flops in a variety of sizes customized with the wedding date or location. Offer beach towels embroidered with the bride and groom's monogram. Depending on the formality of the event, guests can use these items at the wedding and/or reception, and then take them home as favors.

 When you’re meditating, you’ll want to wear something that lets you move and stretch.Comfortable clothing should be loose, made of a soft material, and allow you to move your body around freely without being restrained.


Avoid wearing jeans.
Yoga pants are a good option, especially when combined with a spandex or acrylic top.
Gym shorts or athletic shorts and a cotton t-shirt are a fine option.
 Set a specific time aside for your meditation (at least 30 minutes), or take advantage of an opening during your schedule. This should be a time when you do not have any meetings or any work left. You may choose to meditate:


During an early morning or late evening, when people around you are still asleep or going to bed.
On a lunch break during your workday.
 The space you meditate in should be well lit (preferably with natural light) and ventilated. Choose a place where you will not be distracted by things including:


Children (yours or other people’s).
Pets or other animals.
Noises from traffic or machinery.
Your cell phone or computer.

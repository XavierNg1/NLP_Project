 If you like to dance in public or just for fun, why not turn on your stereo and dance? Try dancing to a quick or happy song for fifteen minutes every night... although you might enjoy yourself so much, you won't want to stop!;
, If you have a particular pastime such as tennis and soccer, aren't you in luck! Why not join a club nearby and keep yourself motivated for at least one day of the week?

, If you like to just play the Wii or Playstation, try to focus on playing more games that keep you motivated e.g for Wii: Just Dance, Wii Sports, Wii Fit. If you have a PlayStation Move or PlayStation 1, why not use them for playing active games?

, If you like to walk and talk and shop with your friends, what more fun and easy way to lose weight is walking around with your friends or doing some serious shopping at the mall? Not only would you be enjoying yourself, but you'd have lost weight just by walking!

, Cleaning the house may seem like a tiresome task, but actually, bit by bit, it makes you lose weight! Working hard by walking around and stretching your arms to clean is actually a handy way to lose weight and keep your house clean!

, If your school/workplace is close by, why not walk? You may not notice, but as you walk, the more you'll lose weight!

, As long as you eat in moderation, you'd be fine! Study your food pyramid, and you'll see it's okay to have the occasional chocolate cake slice or ice cream! So, while doing all those fun things, you don't have to go completely off the things you love!

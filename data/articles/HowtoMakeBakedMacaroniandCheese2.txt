 Set the dish aside.
 Fill a large pot with about 4 quarts (3.79 liters) of water and add 2 teaspoons of salt. Bring the water to a boil, then add the macaroni. Cook the macaroni for 5 to 7 minutes, or until just about done.
 Place a large strainer or colander into the sink, and dump the macaroni into it. Shake the strainer a little to get rid of excess water, then add 2 tablespoons of butter. Stir the macaroni to spread the butter evenly, then set it aside.
 Pour the milk into a saucepan and add the garlic, bay leaf, thyme, and mustard. Cut a medium-sized onion in half, stick a clove into it, and add it into the milk as well. Cook the milk until it starts to steam, stirring occasionally.


Save the other half of the onion for another recipe.
 This will allow the flavors to continue to mix and fuse while you prepare the roux.
 Add 2 tablespoons of butter and the flour into a pot. Cook it over medium heat for about 2 to 3 minutes, stirring often. Don't let it change color or turn golden-brown.


Make sure that the pot is big enough to hold the milk mixture. You will be straining the milk into this.
 Hold a strainer over the pot with the roux in it. Pour the milk through it, and stir the milk mixture briskly to avoid lumps. Discard the onion, garlic, and herbs.
 This will take about 5 minutes. Be sure to stir the sauce often so that it doesn't scorch or stick to the bottom of the pan.
 The cheese should melt into a smooth consistency. Save the rest of the cheese and the cheddar chunks for later.
 Give the sauce a taste, and add some salt and pepper if needed. How much you add depends entirely on your personal preferences.
 Keep stirring until the sauce coats the macaroni evenly and the cheddar chunks are mostly melted.
 To make the flavor more consistent, mix the remaining cheeses in a large bowl first, then spread them evenly across the top of the macaroni. Do not stir.
 When the macaroni is done, pull it out of the oven using oven mitts or potholders.
 Cover and store any leftovers. You can reheat them again in the microwave the next day.

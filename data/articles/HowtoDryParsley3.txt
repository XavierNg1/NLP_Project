 While they can be pricey, dehydrators can offer lower heat and more drying control than the oven. If you want to be able to dry parsley quickly, this can be an effective method.


Usually, food dehydrators will have an herb setting. Clean the parsley as you would to dry it in the oven, spread the parsley on the drying trays, and follow the instructions on your dehydrator.
 All you need to dehydrate parsley is a good hot day without much cloud cover and a baking sheet. You need to make sure that it isn't too humid, or the parsley won't dry properly.


Old window screens can make excellent drying racks to separate the parsley from the cookie sheet or baking tray. Cut the old screens to fit the size of the tray, and place the parsley on top to keep air flowing evenly around the parsley as it dries in the sun.Over the course of the day, turn the parsley over so it gets evenly tanned on both sides. Depending on where you live and the amount of sun available, it may take a few days or be perfectly dry by lunchtime. Keep an eye on it and make sure to bring it in when it gets dark, to avoid dew.
 You can dry parsley in the microwave, but you can also burn it very quickly, and its difficult to get the parsley dried evenly (as with most microwaved things). If you want to use the microwave, spread your cleaned parsley out on a paper plate in a single layer and nuke it for a minute or two at a time. Keep close watch. If it starts getting dark, or smoking, take it out.

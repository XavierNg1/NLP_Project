 Because Chinese Crested dogs have hairless bodies, their skin is prone to sunburn. If you know you will be spending an extended amount time in the sun, for example 45 minutes or more, apply sunscreen on your dog. Use dog-safe, recommended sunscreen. You can find this at pet supply stores.Apply sunscreen sparingly. Excess lotion will block your dog’s pores and lead to acne. Always bathe your dog afterwards.You can also limit sun exposure by providing shady areas or by carrying an umbrella with you whenever you go outdoors.
If you dog does get sunburned, apply an aftersun aloe lotion to soothe the skin. You can use an over-the-counter aloe vera lotion normally used by humans. If you are concerned about the sunburn, contact your vet.;
, You will also need to protect your dog during the winter months. Prevent your Chinese Crested dog from becoming too cold by buying sweaters. Sweaters keep your dog warm during the winter months.Do not purchase sweaters that are 100% wool. The wool can cause your dog’s skin to become irritated. Instead, buy a sweater that is a mix of wool and cotton or acrylic.If you live in a wet or rainy area, purchase a sweater that is rain and snow resistant. Sweaters that absorb water can make your dog colder than no sweater at all., Like human skin, the skin of Chinese Crested dogs is prone to acne. You can treat acne with the same products used to treat human acne. However, it is always best to talk with your vet about the best products to use to treat your dog’s acne.Avoid squeezing or popping pimples and blackheads. Squeezing and/or popping pimples can cause infections, scarring, and discolor the skin.
Make sure to keep your dog's hair groomed. Long hair can cause your dog's skin to breakout in acne.

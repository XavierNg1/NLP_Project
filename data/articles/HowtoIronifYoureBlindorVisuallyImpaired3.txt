 Full-size iron boards can be unwieldy and difficult to set up. Instead, consider using a smaller, tabletop board. They’re easier to store and set up, and will allow you to choose almost any place in your home to iron clothes.There are also ironing board alternatives, like heat-resistant magnetic pads that stick to the tops of washers or dryers. Other non-magnetic substitutes that don’t stay in place, like a blanket or towel laid over a tabletop, are cumbersome and aren’t the best options.
 If you’re visually impaired, choose a solid-colored ironing board or board cover. Avoid patterns, and go for a color that doesn’t appear much in your wardrobe to provide a strong contrast between the board and your garments. That way, you’ll be able to distinguish the board from your clothing more easily., If most of your garments are, for example, cotton, and you don’t own many delicate items, you can keep your iron on a cotton setting. However, just in case, you should mark your appliance’s settings using three-dimensional plastic liquid. For example, use your tactile pen to mark one dot on the lowest setting or use a combination of dots to distinguish the settings you use.

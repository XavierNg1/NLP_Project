Medium to high ponytails generally look the best if you are going for a fun look.
A low bun typically looks more professional., You will want the hair to dry completely while it is in the bun so that the curls will remain after you have removed it. Leaving the hair overnight will ensure that they can have ample time to dry.


Remove the bun in the morning. Carefully undo the bun, leaving it in the ponytail. Your hair should be cute, curly, and ready to go with minimal effort!

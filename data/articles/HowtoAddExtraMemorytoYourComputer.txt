 There are different types of Random Access Memory. Some may work with your computer, and some may not. Consult the owner's manual for your computer or mother board to determine the correct RAM type.;
, Most computers will have thumb screws, Philips screws, or push buttons to open the case or remove the side panel. Locate the screws or buttons and remove the access panel or door.
 Most standard desktop computers will have two, four, or six slots. They are often grouped together and at least one of the available slots will already contain a memory module, as you must have RAM fitted to your computer for it to boot.


In newer machines, the RAM slots will be coloured. It is best to fill each colour first, rather than shoving the RAM in wherever.
 Note on the module there is an off-center indent, line this up with the bump in the slot to ensure the RAM is correctly seated.


Apply pressure to the corners, and do not be afraid to push.
Keep pushing until you hear a click, or the holding tabs on either side flip snugly into the indentations on either end of the module.

 You can use a variety of types of ribbon to create a hippie headband. If you like two types of ribbon, try gluing the thinner ribbon on top of the wider ribbon for a fun look. Many ribbon types will look good for a boho look.


Lace
Suede
Satin

, Measure your head with the ribbon by wrapping it around your head. Pinch the ribbon where the ends meet to measure the circumference of your head. Cut the ribbon about four inches shorter than the circumference of your head.


If you want to make the headband a no-slip headband, you can sew a strip of the hook side of velcro on the underside of the ribbon., Use scissors to cut about 5 inches of elastic. The elastic shouldn’t be too wide, ¼ inch elastic works great for making headband.


You can use elastic in any color, but if you choose a color that matches your hair it will blend and look more natural.
 Use hot glue to glue the ribbon to the elastic. Glue about ½ inch of the end of the elastic to the end of the ribbon. Repeat with the opposite ends.Make sure you glue the elastic to the underside of the fabric, not the printed side.
Wait about two to three minutes or until the glue is completely dry to wear your headband.

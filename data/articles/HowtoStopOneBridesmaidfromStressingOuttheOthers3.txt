 This is a great way to introduce your bridesmaids to each other if they are not all friends. Plan activities and games where each bridesmaid tells a little bit about themselves, how they know the bride, and what they are looking forward to in the wedding.This way your bridesmaids will be comfortable enough to plan your bridal shower and bachelorette party when the time comes.
 Invite your bridesmaids to a local winery to help you pick out a couple wines for the wedding or the bridal shower. Make sure to take each bridesmaidâ€™s opinion into consideration.If one of the bridesmaids cannot make it to the event, make sure to schedule another event that she can attend.
 Planning parties and events can be quite stressful. A movie night (or a spa day) is a great way to help your bridesmaids wind down and release some tension.This is also a great way to let them know how grateful you are for all of their hard work.

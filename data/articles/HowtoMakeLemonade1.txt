 The pitcher will need to be able to hold about 8 cups (1.90 liters) of liquid.;
, You will need 2 cups (450 milliliters) of lemon juice, which will take about eight to ten lemons. Cut the lemons in half, and use a citrus squeezer, a hand juicer, or a wooden reamer to squeeze the juice from the lemons.









To get more juice out of each lemon, roll the lemons across a flat surface while pressing down on them. Do this before cutting and juicing them. The rolling and pressing motion loosens the flesh inside and helps the lemons release more juice when you squeeze them., You may add the pulp if you like a thicker lemonade, or you may discard it along with the seeds. If you do not want the pulp, you can put a strainer over the pitcher, before pouring in the lemon juice. The strainer will catch the pulp. Once all of the juice is inside the pitcher, take the strainer off the pitcher and discard the pulp and seeds.
 You will need 6 cups (1.35 liters) of cold water. You can also use sparkling for a carbonated lemonade.
 You will need about 1 cup (225 grams) of sugar. If you'd like your lemonade to be less sweet, then use a little bit less sugar.
 You can use a large spoon or a whisk. Keep stirring until the sugar dissolves; there may be some sugar granules left at the bottom of the pitcher, which is normal. At this point, you can taste the lemonade to see if it needs to be sweeter or less sweet. Here are some suggestions:








If the lemonade is too sour, add a few tablespoons of sugar.
If the lemonade is too sweet, add the juice of half a lemon and a pinch of salt, if desired.
 Leave the lemonade in the fridge for about 3 hours.
 Put some ice cubes into a glass, and pour the lemonade into the glass. You can garnish the lemonade with a slice of lemon or a few mint leaves.

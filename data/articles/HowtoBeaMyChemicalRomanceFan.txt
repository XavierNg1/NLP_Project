 Understand the beautiful meaning behind their songs and enjoy them. Know more songs than their most popular ones. Really listen to their lyrics and connect with them. If you are willing, get all of their music.;

, Don't self-harm or pretend to be Gerard Way because that isn't who you are.
 You'll probably just annoy people and make yourself sad. Be happy that they were in this incredible band for 12 years.
 Gerard, Frank, and Mikey are in new bands now, and Ray is working on a solo album currently. Give their new stuff a try.

, All fans are equal. If you're 25 and have been listening to them since they started, that doesn't mean you're a better fan than the 14 year old girl that hadn't heard of them until after their breakup.
 It's sad that they broke up, but don't be angry and refuse to listen to their solo music, instead support them and their new careers.
 Make sure you know what instruments they play. Also know that Gerard is Mikey Way's older brother.

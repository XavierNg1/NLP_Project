 Before you use a cuticle pusher or nippers, it is important to use a cuticle softener or remover. This will make it easier to push back the cuticles and also to remove any excess skin with the nippers.Try soaking nails in a solution of warm water with a few drops of hand soap in it. Let the nails soak for about five minutes.
Then, remove the nails from the water and dry them off with a towel. Apply a drop of cuticle softener to each cuticle and rub it around gently.;
, Use the rounded edge of your cuticle pusher to gently push back the cuticle. Do this for all of the nails.








Make sure that you do not force the cuticle back.Just push it back gently.
If the cuticles are difficult to push back, then you might want to soak the nails in warm water for a little longer.
 The cuticle pusher should have a pointed end on the opposite side. You can use this side of the cuticle pusher to scrape away any debris or dirt that is near the cuticle.








Be careful with this tool. Do not try to stick it under the cuticle.
 After you finish pushing back and cleaning around the cuticle, check for any excess skin around the cuticle area that might interfere with painting the nail. If you spot any excess skin, then you can use the cuticle nippers to remove it.








To use the cuticle nippers, open the nippers and place them over the excess skin. Look for skin that is sticking out or that appears ragged.
Then, squeeze the nippers to sever the skin from the cuticle and then release. Do not squeeze the skin and pull! This may result in bleeding.
After you release the nippers, the skin you squeezed should come right off or you should be able to brush the skin away.

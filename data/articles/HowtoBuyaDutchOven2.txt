 Cast iron distributes heat more efficiently and evenly, but aluminum is lighter, which may be an important factor if you will be hauling the oven often or for long distances. Most traditional Dutch ovens are made of cast iron.
 If you are buying a Dutch oven for general purposes, rather than to cook something in particular, you may consider getting a 12 inch (30.5 cm) oven, which will hold enough food for a few people.
 You will also want to observe the thickness of the Dutch oven to make sure that it is consistent.
 The pot should have a handle on the lid that will allow it to be opened with a lid lifter.
 The bail is a loop made of wire on both sides of the Dutch oven that is used to lift it onto a fire.
 They should be at least 1 inch (2.2 cm) long and not have any cracks or deformities. The legs should be strong and sturdy.
 A pre-seasoned oven is more convenient than seasoning your own, and does not generally need to be seasoned regularly.

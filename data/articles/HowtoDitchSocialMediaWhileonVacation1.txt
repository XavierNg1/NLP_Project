 If you tell yourself beforehand that you won’t be uploading photos during your vacation, you’re more likely to stick to your pledge. You might even tease your friends and followers about the onslaught of media you’ll have for them when you get back. , If your job requires logging onto social media several times a day, it may be hard to step away during vacation. But, you can. Most social media outlets let you schedule posts in advance. If not, there is extension software that will allow you to schedule posts on various media outlets at once.Scheduling in advance can help you stay “active” on social media for your job while still taking an actual break. If someone is needed to respond to comments or post news updates, ask a coworker to step in for you.
 No doubt, you have been conditioned to move to your favorite social media outlets after you do other operations on your smartphone. Paying a bill or responding to an email may inadvertently lead to you losing hours of your vacation time lurking on your friends’ pages. To avoid this, limit your smartphone use to its most basic functions—making calls, sending texts, and checking the weather.


Ensure that you stay off social media by logging out completely. This also helps so that you aren’t drawn in by nonstop notifications.
The point of a vacation is to take a break from work. Making this commitment might help you overcome your workaholic problem, if you have one.

 Wash fresh sweet potatoes with running water and a vegetable brush. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin.


Rinsing the sweet potatoes under running water is not enough to clean them. In order to get them thoroughly clean, you should gently scrub them with a vegetable brush. Scrub gently to avoid bruising the flesh.
If you do not have a vegetable peeler, you can also remove the skin with a small paring knife that has a smooth blade.
Start with fresh sweet potatoes to maximize the length of time they can be stored.
 Fill a large stockpot with water and boil it over high heat. Add the sweet potatoes and cook until tender.


You need to cook the sweet potatoes before you can freeze them, as raw sweet potatoes tend to break down and lose both flavor and nutrients in the freezer.
Boiling is the preferred method of cooking sweet potatoes for freezer storage. The boiling process should take about 20 minutes for a standard-size sweet potato.
 Use a knife to cut the sweet potatoes into thin slices or a potato masher to mash the sweet potatoes.


Do not store the cooked sweet potatoes whole.
You could also use an electric mixer to beat the sweet potatoes into a mashed consistency, instead.
 Add roughly 1 tsp (5 ml) of lemon juice per sweet potato to the slices or mashed mix.


Make sure that the sweet potatoes are coated in the lemon juice. Lemon juice can prevent discoloration, but you should only use a small amount to avoid altering the taste.
 Allow the sweet potatoes to cool before storing them.


Freezing the sweet potatoes while warm can cause cause condensation to build in the container, causing them to spoil sooner.
 Place the mashed sweet potatoes or sliced sweet potatoes in freezer-safe resealable plastic bags or freezer-safe plastic containers.


Do not use metal or glass containers.
 On average, cooked sweet potatoes stored in the freezer can last for 10 to 12 months.

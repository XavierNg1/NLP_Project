 Human nail clippers are more likely to cut them too high and make them bleed.
 Ferretone is recommended, but it’s up to you. If you don’t want to, put your ferret on a counter (or another flat surface) and place 4-5 treats on the counter. It’s better if someone holds the treats because if the treats fall off the counter your ferret will want to go after them and you may cut them if they move.
 Depending on the length, you should see a little red line at about the middle of the nail. You cannot cut above that or they will bleed! Once your ferret begins eating the treats, begin trimming. {Gulp!}

, If the treats run out before you are done, stop trimming until the person holding the treats can add more.
 Make sure you know where the red line is before starting on the next nail.
 Stick the nail that is bleeding into the bowl and cover the nail with the baking soda. The bleeding should stop within 3-5 minutes. If it doesn’t, wrap some tissue around it. Do NOT keep cutting. Wait at least a week or until the ferret’s nail heals before cutting the rest just in case you cut another one.
 (They may be thirsty from all the treats.)

 Straight, wavy, curly, it doesn't matter. Solid, natural colors only. No highlights.
 For jewelry, try a pair of tasteful chandelier or stud earrings in both classic and unique styles, and a matching cross necklace. Gold works as well as silver. Bandanas are versatile and instantly, recognizably country.


Don't commit the sin of too much jewelry. You shouldn't be inviting comparisons to Mr. T.
 So are belts featuring large buckles.
 Apply a coral blush with a slight bronze undertone for a sunkissed look on the apples of your cheeks. Apply one coat of brown mascara and a sheer lip gloss. No heavy eyeliner. Black mascara is fine. For eyeliner, use something that will highlight your eyes. If you have blue eyes, use black or navy blue. For green, use brown or an emerald color. For brown, brown or black works great!


Just as with jewelry, keep it tasteful and understated.
 A couple sprays is plenty. Country girls have a light, flowery smell.

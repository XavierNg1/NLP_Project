 Studies have shown that most babies need more iron than their mothers can provide through breastfeeding. Thus, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other similar groups have endorsed providing infants with at least some iron supplementation through formula during their first months of life.


Whether your baby relies entirely on formula or relies on it as a supplement, formula should have added iron.
Most commercially available formulas contain enough iron for babies born on time and without serious medical conditions.
Consult your doctor if you have any questions about your baby’s iron needs and their formula., There are a wide variety of formulas available to ensure babies have enough iron in their diet. Ultimately, though, all formula given to babies should contain iron supplements.


Formula that contains added iron may be labeled “with iron” or “iron fortified.”
Avoid low-iron formula or milk until your baby is over a year old.
Your doctor may recommend a specific formula., Between four and six months, you’ll begin to transition your baby from breastmilk or formula to solid food. This is an important transition, and you must continue to consider your baby’s iron needs during it.


Consider iron-fortified baby cereal.
Buy baby food fortified with iron.
Talk to your pediatrician about the iron content of baby food. They may be able to recommend something., After eight months or so, you should begin the process of transitioning your baby to table food. You'll know if your baby is ready for table food if they are very proactive at meal time, if they play with their spoon, or if they mash or lump their food. When transitioning to table food, feed your baby foods rich in iron like:


Poultry, beef, pork, chicken, or fish
Eggs
Lentils, beans, or tofu
Iron-fortified baby cereal

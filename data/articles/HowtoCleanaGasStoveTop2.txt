 If the crust of food on your stove isn’t coming off with soap and water, try a towel “mask.” Wet a dishtowel, wring it, and warm it in the microwave for 30 seconds. If your microwave is particularly powerful, be careful of any hot steam coming off the towel when you open the microwave., Use the damp, warm towel to cover any stuck on bits on the stove, leaving the towel in place for 15 minutes. You can repeat this step several times.


The warm steam helps loosen stuck on gunk on the stove. When the mess on the stove is loose, scrub as normal with warm water and soap.
 If soap and water alone aren’t cutting the grime on your stove, you can create a mix of 50% white vinegar and 50% water as a homemade cleaning solution. Scrub your stove using the solution with the rough side of a sponge.
 When finished, rinse your sponge and clean the stove with plain water to cut the strong smell of the vinegar. Dry the stovetop with a clean kitchen towel. It may help to open a window for ventilation., If your stains have been set for months, you may want to try a commercial over cleaner on the stovetop, such as Easy-Off Oven Cleaner or Goo Gone Oven Cleaner. As most stovetops and ovens are made of the same materials, a solution that is cleared for your oven should be no issue on the stove. Follow the cleaner’s directions carefully, ventilating the area if necessary.

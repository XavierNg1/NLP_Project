 Be sure not to leave out any of them, even if you think you don't need to revise.;
, This process requires a lot of thought, so be careful how you select. Do not put your subjects in order of which one you like best and least, but on how much work you think a subject needs.
 If it's a week before the exams, aim for around 3-4 hours of good, solid revision. This means you'll have around 21-28 hours to revise in that week. If it's the night before the exams, aim for no more than 4 hours that day, so as not to stress yourself out.
, Space out your subjects so you don't have all of your dreaded subjects on one day, but have a variety.
 Having a strict routine will make you revise better.

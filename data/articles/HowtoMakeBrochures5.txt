 This will help you craft your sentences for a certain reader. It will also help you decide how much knowledge of the subject your reader should already have. If the brochure is for school, you shouldn’t have to alter your language much for your classmates to understand.Consider English reading capabilities. If you are targeting people whose native tongue is not English, make your language clearer than you normally would.
You may be, for instance, targeting people who are already diagnosed with a disease, and you are educating them about further treatment methods. You won’t need to explain the basics of the disease, unless your approach is radically different from other methods.
 The reader shouldn’t be wondering what to do after reading the brochure, if anything. There is nothing wrong with simply educating your readers. However, if you suggest further action, make that clear.


For example, you may be writing a brochure about the dangers of smoke inhalation. Put down symptoms of common lung diseases, and encourage readers to see a doctor if they have any of them.
 Educational brochures should be 40-50% white space to make them easier to read. You probably have a lot of information you want to include, but brochures aren’t books. They should give basic details about a topic in hopes of getting a reader to seek more information., An effect format for educational brochures is asking basic questions that you will answer. This guides the reader to the information you want to provide, keeping him or her from wondering what the purpose is. Simply stating the answer also makes it easy for him or her to understand the lesson or conclusion.For example, a brochure on smoke inhalation might begin with “What are the symptoms of smoke inhalation?” Then you should list the symptoms. You might then ask “When should I see a doctor?” Listing the most dangerous symptoms is a way of guiding the reader to determining whether or not to see a doctor.

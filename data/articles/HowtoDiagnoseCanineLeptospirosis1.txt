 After a dog has been infected with leptospirosis, the first symptoms will take about one week to appear. Early signs of leptospirosis may not be easy to detect, but a dog that has just been infected with leptospirosis may have symptoms that include:fever
lethargy (low energy and sleeping more than usual);
, If a dog has the acute (sudden, serious illness) form of leptospirosis, then the condition can kill the dog within 48 hours. Seek immediate veterinary attention for a dog with acute symptoms of leptospirosis. Acute symptoms may include:profuse vomiting
liquid bloody diarrhea
collapse
shock
loss of consciousness
dark urine
jaundice (yellowing of the gums and/or the whites of the eyes)
extreme thirst

, If the dog has a less severe form of leptospirosis, then he may have some moderate symptoms. Even though the symptoms may not seem too serious, you will still need to seek veterinary treatment for your dog dog. Some symptoms of moderate leptospirosis include:fever
vomiting
diarrhea
thirst
weight loss

, Leptospirosis can cause a sudden severe illness or develop over time. Leptospirosis also shares some of the same symptoms as other conditions, such as distemper and infectious canine hepatitis, so you may want to consider other possible causes of your dog's illness as well.If you even suspect that your dog is ill, then take him to see a veterinarian as soon as possible.
 Leptospira bacteria enters the dog's body through damaged skin or from swallowing the bacteria. Dogs that are exposed to moist environments and rats are at a higher risk of developing leptospirosis. Working or hunting dogs are also at increased risk due to minor cuts and scrapes that they get from being outside and doing their jobs.

 To make stud earrings you will need: two stud-style earring posts and two rubber or butterfly backs. You will also need a hot glue gun or some superglue. The other materials will depend on what kind of earrings you want to make - you can use pearls or beads, pieces of colored fabric or glitter glue.
 Use a damp cloth or a q-tip dipped in some rubbing alcohol to clean the earring posts. This removes any dust and makes them safe to wear. You could also use a piece of sandpaper to rough-up the face of the earring post, as this helps the glue to stick better.
 Now you're free to attach anything you like to the face of the earring post.









Pearl or glass beads are an easy option that produces simple, pretty results. Just place a drop of glue on the earring post and press the bead against it, holding it for a minute while the glues sets.
To make flower studs, cut out eight circles (each one slightly smaller from the last) from the colored net fabric. Layer the circles one on top of the other to form a flower pattern, then use a threaded needle to sew a small bead onto the center of the flower. Secure the flower with a couple of stitches at the back. Place a dot of glue on the earring post and stick the flower on top.
The easiest option is just to cover the face of the earring post in some gold, silver or colored glitter glue and wait for it to dry. Then you have a simple sparkly earring!

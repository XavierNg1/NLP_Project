 If your pregnancy is going relatively smoothly, you may only need intermittent monitoring during labor. This means that a nurse will check the heartbeat every fifteen to thirty minutes with a doppler device or fetoscope., If the doctor suspects there is a problem, they may perform continuous monitoring. In this case, a doppler device will be attached to your stomach with a belt. This will monitor the baby’s heartbeat constantly throughout labor.This method may be used if you have taken an epidural or oxytocin. It may also be used if there are complications with the pregnancy.
 In some extreme cases, your doctor may need to insert a special wire into your cervix. This wire will attach to the fetus’ head. The doctor will get a more accurate measure of the baby’s heart rate.Before this procedure, your doctor or nurse may do a vaginal exam first. They will then insert a catheter so that they can attach a wire to the baby. This can also help track the baby's movements.
This is a more invasive procedure that can only be done after your water has broken. It is typically only done if the doctor cannot find the baby’s heart using an external monitor or if there are severe complications.
 If the doctor determines that there may be complications, follow their instructions. They may recommend further procedures to check on the health of the baby during labor.

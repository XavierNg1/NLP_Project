 Caulk removers are special chemical products designed to moisten and soften the caulk, making it easier to remove so that you do not need to chip and chisel it away.;
, Use a clean blade on a utility knife to slice down the center of the softened caulk. Most of the caulk should be freed.
 You might be able to pull it away by hand, but since gutter caulk can be thick, you may need to grip onto it using needle-nose pliers. Either way, most of the old caulk should come up.
 Use small chisel or the hook end of a painter's five-in-one tool to rake away any leftover chunks until the area is completely clean.
 Scrub it with a toothbrush or abrasive sponge dipped into a non-ammonia cleaner. Follow by scrubbing the area with a solution made with 1/3 cup (80 ml) bleach and 1 gallon (4 liters) of water. Cleaning the area will remove any fungi or decayed leaves that may have worked their way into the cracking caulk.
 Before applying new caulk, the area should be completely dry. Allowing the area to air dry is best, but if rain, other precipitation, or humidity threatens to create a problem, dry it out by hand using a clean, dry towel.

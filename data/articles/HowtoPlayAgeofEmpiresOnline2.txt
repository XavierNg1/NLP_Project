 GameRanger is a third party website that allows you to start and join multiplayer games with friends, online. Start by downloading GameRanger, by clicking the large 'Download' button on their website which you can find at www.gameranger.com.
 Create your username and password on the website, and go through the set-up options that you are prompted with. To play the game you want, you have to find the '.exe File' from your Age of Empires download, so GameRanger can start the game immediately after the host of the game starts.
 Find the Age of Empires 3 servers and look for games which aren't currently playing or don't already have the maximum number of players (or you host a new server and wait for players to join). When you've found a room, you can communicate with the other players there. The host will start the game and GameRanger opens Age of Empires 3 and you can join the other players and play with them. If you liked the battle with these people, you can add them to your friend-list on GameRanger.
 If you want to play just with your friends over the Internet you can use GameRanger and only allow them to join or you use Hamachi. Hamachi is a platform where players can host "Online-Rooms" and people can join this room if they have internet and the password. To play Age of Empires 3 via Hamachi, you need an extra program called AoE3Loader. It connects the game with Hamachi. I don't really know why you need AoE3Loader to play via Hamachi, but it doesn't work without AoE3Loader.


When you and the other players downloaded AoE3Loader and are all in the Hamachi-Room, you start the game manually (it doesn't open Age of Empires 3 by itself like GameRanger does) and you host or join like in a normal game.

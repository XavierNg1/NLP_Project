Coordinate the scraps by their color.
Determine how much yardage you have. You will be able to make approximately 30 inches (76cm) of garland per yard (91cm) of fabric you have on hand.
Choose 2 to 4 coordinating fabrics to use for your garland.;
, 

If needed, wash the fabric. This step may only be needed if the intended fabric is dirty or smelly--such as those that are musty or reek of mothballs. Stained fabric usually can be used as the stained parts are usually simply not included.
If needed, press the fabric smooth. This project will work with fabric that is not perfectly smooth, but creates a different look.
 The strips should measure five inches long by one inch wide (12.5cm x 2.5cm). You can cut them longer if you wish, but you will need to cut them all the same length for best results.

A rotary cutter and mat make this part of the project a breeze.
You will need approximately 24 strips per linear feet of finished garland.
 Tie a knot around 10 inches (25cm) from the end., Place it under the twine, ready for tying.



Use a simple overhand knot for best results.
 Then reach for your next piece of fabric and repeat.
 Tie until you have reached the length you like or until you run out of fabric., Finish by cutting the end of the twine long enough to facilitate hanging.

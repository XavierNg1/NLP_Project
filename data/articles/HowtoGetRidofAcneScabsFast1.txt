 You should clean the scabbed area twice each day. You can use an acne cleanser or antibacterial soap. Rub vigorously until dry afterwards.Use a clean washcloth each time you wash your acne scabs. If you reuse the washcloths, you can spread bacteria, which may slow down the healing process.;
, After cleaning with soap, you can use an oil to help moisturize and remove the scabs. Apply an oil such as castor oil, olive oil, almond oil, mineral oil, or any other oil you wish. Use a clean washcloth to gently work the oil into the scab. Be gentle and use only slight pressure. Rinse well and re-moisturize.This removes bits and pieces of the scab. However, you should only be removing those bits and pieces that fall off easily. Don’t force any scabs off.
The scab should fall off within five to seven days. Some scabs may fall off earlier and some may take longer. Just don’t force it.
 Soak a clean cloth in warm water and then ring it out. Press the compress to your acne scabs for about 10 to 15 minutes, twice a day. The moist heat helps to soften the scab, which will help them come off safely and naturally. It also can help the wound to heal.Don’t scrub with the compress. Just hold it against the acne scabs.
 Soaking in a bath filled with Epsom salts can help moisturize the scabs and promote healing. Fill a tub with warm water and Epsom salts. Soak the areas containing the acne scabs in the bathwater for around an hour.Repeat the process every day until the scab is removed.

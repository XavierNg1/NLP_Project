, Some Empaths have an extensive range, however one can pull that range back in rather the same fashion that one pushes out receptiveness out when we sense someone is in trouble.



Picture yourself in a bubble that is not clear where all feelings, thoughts or physical pain is muted due to the bubble. This will shorten your range, and decrease the impact of any stray feelings you do pick up.
When alone, picture yourself in a situation where you are surrounded by mirrors facing out. You can still see, but feelings, thoughts and physical challenges are reflected back at others, and do not pass through to you.
 Although these are simply cognitive constructs, the do allow us to narrow our bandwidth (as people do physically and mentally broadcast their feelings) as well allow one to pull the scanning abilities inwards.
, Awareness of the bubble or the mirrors must be maintained during immersion in groups of people for them to work.


Erosion will happen to these defenses the longer we are in highly charged situations with others. Become aware of when others emotions begin to seep in, and record the amount of time that has passed.



This model of exercising and taking notes will enable you to extract yourself from the situation before you would begin to feel overwhelmed.
 Although we tend to do that often, and there is an attraction to it, it will only serve to break up the barriers you have worked to develop.

 Line with parchment paper or a silicone sheet.;
, Gently heat. Stir continuously until the sugar dissolves (about 5 minutes).
 Bring the mixture to the boil, with the candy thermometer in the mixture as it boils, stirring occasionally. Bring to 100ºC/215ºF, then lower the heat to a gentle boil.
 When the mixture reaches 115ºC/240ºF, it is ready to remove from the heat.
 You can use a wooden spoon to do this or make it easier by using a handheld electric whisk or food processor. Beat for 10 minutes.
 Beat for another 15 minutes or until the mixture ceases to appear shiny.
 About an hour after cooling, score the square marks on the surface of the fudge.
 Once completely cooled and set, either cut or break the fudge into squares. The fudge is now ready to serve or give as a gift.


For a gift, line a box or other container with wax paper to prevent sticking and leakage of the fat from the fudge.
Store in an airtight container.

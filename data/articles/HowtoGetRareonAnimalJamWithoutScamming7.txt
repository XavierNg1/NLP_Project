 Be on during Christmas/holiday season to get a bow and arrow. Collect clearance items. Clearance items are items that are leaving the shops for a while. You know something is a clearance item because it will have an orange tag that says "(certain number) days left".
 Go around Jamaa Township, many people will say, "Anything on trade for (a rare item)!" If you have that rare item, see if you want anything on their trade list. If you do, trade your item for it, and they will accept.
 Now, you probably are a little rare. After trying this a few times, you will be rarer.
 Once you're at Aldan, find a trading party, and go to it. Trade people at the party and they will probably trade you. If they accept it, you'll get their item, and if you accept their trade, they get your item.
 You may be super rare now. At this point, good luck.
 If you're a member, go in the Adventures and unlock the secret passages. For example, in the Phantom portal, there is a secret passage for Foxes. If you unlocked it, click on the treasure chest and then you get a rare item.

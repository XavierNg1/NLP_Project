 Spending those last few minutes with your friend before everything changes will be priceless. If it's not possible to see her off at the station, plan a different time to say goodbye in the last few days before she leaves.


Ask your friend if she needs help packing. That's a good way to spend time with her and help her reduce the stress of moving.
She may be busy with her family during those last few days. If that's the case, drop by for an hour or so to say your goodbyes.
 There's no one way to say "goodbye." The best way to do it is to be truthful about how you feel. Even if you aren't entirely eloquent, your friend will know how much you care. The warmth and love you express will bolster her courage to move to a new place and start over.


It can be hard to directly express deep feelings to someone else, but now is the time to do it. Tell your friend you love her and will miss her.
Sometimes "goodbye" is too hard to say. A hug and a sincere smile will tell your friend everything she needs to know.

 Many times the first source of a food recall is provided by the news or newspaper.


If you hear about a food recall in the news or newspaper, listen to the entire broadcast or read the entire article to get as much information as you can. They will generally provide a lot of information for consumers.
Often times the media provides the products numbers and sell-by dates of the affected foods.
They may also provide a website or phone number for you to contact if you have questions about the food, do not know whether or not your food has been contaminated or if you have gotten sick from consuming the contaminated food.;
, After you come across a potential food recall, you'll need to verify the information you heard with the appropriate government authority.


Scroll through the list of recall products or search for a particular food here. They are generally organized by date of recall.
Once you find your specific food recall, click on the food item for more information. The USDA will provide the press release written by the USDA or food manufacturer, why the product was recalled, what the potential adverse side effects are, the food name, product number and sell-by date and contact information if you need to speak to someone directly.Write down all pertinent product information so you can use this to compare to foods that you have at home.
 After you've verified there has been a food recall of an item you think you may have bought or currently have in your home, you'll need to double check your product to see if it has been affected by the contamination.


Double check the brand name and product name. Not all products by a certain brand may be affected.
Look at the sell-by date. This is generally found on the side, bottom or back of packages. This is the date that stores follow and should sell the product by.This information is a key part on how food manufacturers help you identify a contaminated product.Look at the product's label and package code. The last part of identifying potentially recalled food items is the product label and package code. This may be near the barcode, but could be in a variety of other places on the package. Take the time to find this code as this is a very specific number given to certain batches. This will confirm if your product is the one that has been recalled., Many times food recalls will include "fresh produce" or those items that are not coming from a specific brand and do not have a package to help identify them. This can make verifying these recalls slightly more difficult.


Again, all food recalls including fresh produce will be listed on the USDA's or FDA's website. They will provide you the produce name and which retailers received shipments of the contaminated produce.
If you think you've purchased recalled fresh produce, call your grocery store immediately to verify this information. Ask to speak to the store manager or produce department manager.
If you're unable to completely verify if you've purchased recalled fresh produce, the USDA recommends throwing out the possibly recalled product regardless to keep you and your family safe., There are a variety of smartphone apps that can help you keep abreast of any food recalls. Some of the apps may also offer additional information on foods. They may tell you what types of additives or preservatives are also contained in some foods.


The USDA and FDA both have mobile apps that you can check regularly for food recalls. These apps will alert you to specific food recalls, provide contact information and provide other food safety information.
AlertMe is another app that specifically will provide alerts to food recalls pertaining to allergens. Many times foods say they do not contain any allergens, but actually do and are being recalled. This is a good app for those will serious food allergies.AskKaren is another app that deals with food safety. This one does not provide information specifically on product recalls, but provides a host of information on food safety., Another method of keeping up-to-date with possible food recalls is by signing up for the USDA or FDA alert systems.The USDA will send you an email newsletter that provides the most recent food recall information. You can sign up for this email service here: Food Safety Email Alert System

The blog not only contains information about specific recalls, but provides consumers with information how to deal with recalls, how to stay up to date with recalls and how to handle foods safely.You can sign up here: Food Safety Blog.
 Outside of the government, there are some other sources to find out if there has been a food recall.

 Start by braiding your hair as youâ€™d like. Create thick braids if you are using wide beads. Make the braids thinner if you are using narrow beads.

Leave half of the braid undone if you'd like the bead to appear in the middle of the braid. Finish the braid and leave the bottom undone if you'd like the bead to appear at the end of the braid.
 Threading tools for hair are thin, short hooks made of wire. Loop the hook part of the threading tool around a portion of your braided hair.You can find threading tools online or at beauty supply stores. Sometimes they come in a kit with hair beads and pins that keep the beads in place.
You can also make your own threading tool at home using craft wire or jewelry wire.
 Take the bead and slide it through the two ends of the threading tool. Pull the bead through the tool until it sits just above your braided hair., Next, pull your hair and the bead through the threading tool. You may need to gently tug on your hair to get it through the bead and the threading tool., Remove the threading tool from your hair and check that the bead sits firmly on your braid. Use a clear elastic band to secure the bead. Tie the elastic band to your braid and slide the bead over it so it stays in place.

You can also use a bead pin to keep the bead in place. Clip the bead pin to your braid and slide the bead over it so it stays put.

 Use some Play-Doh to make a mountain or a statue or something. Make a DIY thing, not a thing you copied from some website.


In a saucepan, add 2 cups water, 4 teaspoons oil, and food coloring (optional). In the same saucepan, add 2 cups flour, 1 cup salt, and 2 teaspoons alum.
Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until non-sticky. Let it cool on wax paper, then store it in a ziplock baggie in the fridge until you're ready to use it.;
, Write out a fake newspaper with events that happened in your family, and hand it out to all your family members. You can also show your newspaper to relatives and/or friends.



Using an empty 2 liter (0.5 US gal) plastic soda bottle, cut a large hole in the center (it should be big enough for a bird to enter). Make a small hole beneath the opening and push a stick through so the birds can perch on it.
Fill the bottle with a little bit of birdseed, and tie a string around the neck of the bottle so you can hang it. If you have a bird feeder hanger with hooks to attach bird feeders to it, use that outside, or you can use a coat hanger. If you don't have either of those, hang your bird feeder from a tree branch.
 The fun part is that you get to decorate it with construction paper, pom-poms, yarn, glitter, markers, and so on. You have the freedom to create anything!

, Get a glass jar and use a circle of fabric with breathing holes in it for a lid. When you're using the jar, use a rubber band to attach the lid. Study ladybugs, ants, and all the crawly creatures of your backyard.

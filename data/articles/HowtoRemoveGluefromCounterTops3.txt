 For extra stubborn glue, you can find commercial glue removing products in hardware stores. Professional glue removers are powerful and you can use them on non-porous surfaces. You can also use them on marble, granite, ceramic, concrete and brick, as long as the surface is sealed.


If you are not sure if your countertops are sealed, try dropping a few drops of water on the surface. If the surface is sealed, then the drops will remain. If not, then they will soak into the surface.Make sure that you pretest the glue removing product on an area that is not too visible. If it causes damage or discoloration, then do not use it., Spray or pour on the recommended amount of product and allow it to sit. For most products, you will need to wait one to three minutes before wiping or scraping the product off.Make sure that you follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions for use.
 After you have left the product on for the suggested amount of time, then you can wipe it off. Use a paper towel or sponge to wipe off the product.It might also be helpful to try scraping at the glue with the putty knife again.
 One application may not be enough to remove all of the glue from your countertop. If you still have glue on your counter after the first application, then reapply the product and repeat the process over again.

 Cats often accidentally knock over candles with their tails. Large dogs might lean against stove knobs and turn up the heat. If you’re cooking on the range or using candles, make sure your pet stays away.


For instance, put up baby gates to keep dogs out.
Close the door of the room or space you’re in so your pets don’t get curious about the flame.
During Halloween, keep jack-o-lanterns outside and away from dry leaves, fake spider webs, and other material that might kindle.Otherwise, your pet might accidentally roll them over into something flammable.;
, So in addition to keeping your pets away while cooking, you should remove the stove knobs once you’re done in the kitchen. Stash the knobs in a kitchen drawer. Most knobs slip off easily, and slip back on just as easily when you’re ready to use the stove again.
 That’s because flameless candles are candles only in appearance. Instead of a wick that you have to light, flameless candles have a small switch on the bottom and an LED light on top. When you turn the device on, it emits a warm glow similar to that of a candle.


Since flameless candles don’t involve actual flames, there is no danger of your pet starting a house fire by knocking one over. Real candles, on the other hand, might accidentally be knocked over by pets.

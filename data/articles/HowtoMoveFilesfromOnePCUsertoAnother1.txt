 Navigate to the folder where the files you want to transfer are located.

 After selecting the files, you can begin the transfer process, but it will depend on your Windows version:


For Windows 7, click on the Edit menu in the menu bar, and a drop-down menu will appear. Click on either “Move to Folder” to remove the folder from the current directory and transfer it to the target location, or “Copy to Folder” to make a copy of the selected files.
For Windows 8, the “Move to” or “Copy to” buttons at the top of the window will be activated after selecting the files. Choose either of the option, and then select “Choose location” at the bottom of the extended menu.
 After selecting either “Move to...” or “Copy to...,” select the Public folder as the target folder then click “Move” or “Copy.”


Your files will be copied (or moved) to the Public folder. It’s now only a matter of the other PC user logging into their account and taking the files from the Public folder.

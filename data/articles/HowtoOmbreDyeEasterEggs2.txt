 This method is recommended for hard boiled eggs. If you only have hallow or blown-out eggs on hand, you can try using them. You might want to cover up the holes with paper clay or speckling, however., Fill a small cup with Â½ cup (120 milliliters) of boiling water. Stir in 1 teaspoon of vinegar and 20 to 40 drops of food coloring.Repeat this step two more times with two different colors. Use colors that are related to each other, such as: red, orange, yellow.

Think about how the colors will mix together. If you use contrasting colors, you'll get brown.
 Make sure that the egg is completely submerged. If you can't decide which color is the lightest, choose a primary color instead., This will take about 2 to 5 minutes. The longer you let the egg sit, the darker it will become., Use a wire egg holder or a pair of tongs to lift the egg out of the dye bath. Set the egg down onto an egg holder or egg carton. Let it dry completely before moving on., This time, dip the egg only two-thirds of the way. The color may change slightly on the egg, because it will be going on top of the first color. For example, if your first color was yellow and your second color was blue, you might get green., You will need to keep the egg in the dye for a few minutes, or it won't be dark enough.Try to hold the egg steady during this time. If your arm gets tired, you could try setting the egg into a wire egg holder, then looping the handle over the rim of the cup., This time, dip only the bottom one-third of the egg into the dye. Once again, hold it there for a few minutes.Depending on the colors you used, the third color may show up true to its shade.
 Once the bottom is the color you want, take the egg out of the dye and set it down onto an egg holder or carton. Let it dry completely.

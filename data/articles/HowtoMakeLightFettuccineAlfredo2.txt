 Bring a large sauce pot full of water to a boil over high heat. Once the water boils, remove the lid and add 8 ounces (226 g) of dry fettuccine pasta. Boil the fettuccine according to the manufacturer's instructions and stir it occasionally to prevent it from sticking together. Drain the pasta once it's finished cooking.You can make the sauce while the pasta is boiling.
 Place 1 tablespoon of butter in a medium saucepan and turn the heat on to medium. Add 2 minced garlic cloves to the melted butter and saute the garlic for 1 minute. Stir in 1 tablespoon of flour. The mixture should turn into a thin paste.This roux (cooked butter and flour) will help the sauce thicken.
 Slowly pour in 1 1/3 cups (320 ml) of low-fat milk with one hand while you use the other hand to whisk constantly. Keep whisking and cooking the alfredo sauce for about 6 minutes. It should start to thicken up.Try to use 1% low-fat milk for the best flavor. You can also use skim milk, but the sauce may not thicken as much.
 Measure out 1 cup (100 g) of the shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and whisk it into the sauce along with 2 tablespoons of neufchatel cheese and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Keep whisking the sauce until both the cheeses dissolve.Neufchatel cheese is also labeled as 1/3-less-fat cream cheese since it's a lower fat option than cream cheese.
 Add the cooked and drained pasta into the saucepan with the alfredo sauce. Use kitchen tongs or two spoons to mix the pasta with the sauce. Sprinkle the reserved 1/4 cup (25 g) of Parmigiano-Reggiano over the pasta.You can garnish the pasta with 2 teaspoons of chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley and a little fresh cracked black pepper.

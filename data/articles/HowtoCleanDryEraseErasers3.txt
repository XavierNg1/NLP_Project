 A gentle, yet slightly abrasive cleanser (like toothpaste) is great for cleaning dry erase erasers. Apply a line of toothpaste to the bottom of each eraser you want to clean., Using a wet washcloth, scrub the eraser in a circular motion. Try to spread the toothpaste across the whole eraser. Be aware that the ink is likely to stain the washcloth you are using., Hold each eraser under warm running water until all ink and toothpaste is removed and the water runs clear. Then set the erasers outside in direct sunlight for 1-2 hours until they are dry.

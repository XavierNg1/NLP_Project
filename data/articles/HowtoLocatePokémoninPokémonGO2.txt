 Look for the blue cubes that rise above the map. These are PokéSpots, or notable places where you can find Poké Balls and sometimes Eggs.


Any user in the game can put a Lure Module onto a PokéSpot. A Lure Module attracts many Pokémon to that particular PokéSpot for 30 minutes. If you hang around at a PokéSpot with a Lure Module currently on it, you will certainly see and catch many Pokémon.
 There are many PokéSpots, but not all of them will have Lure Modules on them at any given time.


To determine if a PokéSpot has a Lure Module on it, see if the PokéSpot has pink petals falling over it.You can also click on the PokéSpot and see if the oval above the photo of the PokéSpot is pink (rather than the usual white).
 Stand or sit near that PokéSpot and wait for the Pokémon to come to you. One should arrive about every three minutes.

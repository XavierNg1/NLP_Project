 Tie the crochet thread onto the tip of the steel crochet hook using a standard slip knot.

In this pattern, you'll need to crochet around the edge of a blank hoop earring. As a result, you'll move directly into the pattern stitches instead of building up a foundation of chains.
 Work one slip stitch over the edge of the metal hoop, positioning the stitch within 1/4 inch (6 mm) of one end.

Hold the hook over the front of the earring hoop while directing the working end of the thread beneath the hoop.
Hook the thread over the edge of the hoop, as though working over the edge of a stitch, and pull it through the loop on your hook. This completes the slip stitch and secures the thread to the earring hoop.
 Single crochet once around the edge of the metal hoop, positioning the stitch directly next to the previous slip stitch.

Position the tip of the hook beneath the earring hoop and hook the thread.
Pull the hooked thread around to the front of the earring hoop.
Hook the thread again from the front, then pull this newest loop through the two thread loops beneath it. This completes the first single crochet.
 Continue making single crochet stitches around the rest of the earring hoop, stopping within 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) of the opposite end.

Note that you may need to periodically push the formed single crochet stitches down the side of the earring to keep them even.
 Work one chain stitch and turn the earring. Chain three, skip over one stitch from the previous row, and single crochet once into the stitch that follows.

Chain three, skip one stitch, and single crochet once into the following stitch; complete this pattern until you reach the end of the earring.
 Cut the thread, leaving a 2-inch (5-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

Weave the excess thread into the stitches, hiding as much as possible. Trim away any excess that cannot be hidden.
 Repeat the same steps to complete another wrapped hoop that matches the first.

Attach the yarn to the side of the hoop, crochet the pattern over the hoop, and fasten off the work.
Once you finish the second earring, the set is done and ready to wear.

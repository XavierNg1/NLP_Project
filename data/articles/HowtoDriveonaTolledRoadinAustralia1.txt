 All toll roads in Australia collect tolls electronically. There are no longer any cash booths on any Australian toll road, meaning you usually need to make payment arrangements prior to travelling on a toll road.
 Most toll operators provide two account types, electronic tag/pass/eTag, and video tolling/number plate recognition. You can also purchase a pass. Getting an account is usually more economic if you intend to use toll roads more than 12 times a year.
 Fund the account (usually with a credit card or BPAY).

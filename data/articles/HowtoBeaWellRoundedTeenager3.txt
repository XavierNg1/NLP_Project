 Although it often seems as though they don't take you seriously, letting your parents know that they can trust you will usually lead to you having more freedom.


Recognize that this is a hard time for your parents. Remember that they're not out to make your life miserableâ€”while you feel like you should be treated like an adult, your parents are struggling with the realization that you're not their baby anymore. They are also likely to be struggling with working, paying a mortgage, raising your siblings as well as you and doing their best to be good parents. It's not an easy job, but you can make it easier by being understanding and friendly.
 Your little sister might seem like the most annoying person in the world now, but you're likely going to spend the rest of your life with her. Plus, being at home will be much more fun when every night is like a sleepover with your best friend.
 Some chores take less than five minutes to complete when many hands are applied to them, and your parents and siblings will be in a much better mood if there is one less thing for them to do. You can even morph chores into a fun way to spend time with your family by turning them into a contest. Try blasting music that everyone enjoys, or having a nice conversation while you work and setting time limits for completion. If you have winners for properly completed chores, prizes can include things like choosing the DVD or movie to watch as a family or choosing what gets cooked for dinner for that evening.


When asked to do a task, do it. This can save many arguments around the house, and when the chores are done you're free to do whatever you want! Arguing can take up a lot of time and creates emotional friction that nobody wants to feel.

 Navigate your way to the mission.;
, A new marker will be placed on your map.
 Look at how many captives there are. If there is only one, locate a small and fast vehicle that can seat two, like an upper-class domed cruiser. If there is more than one, find a large vehicle that is sturdy and can take a few hits, like a garbage truck.
 Leave the vehicle in a position that is easy to access, clear of obstructions, and ready to take off at any moment. Scope the area. Find out what section the hostage(s) is in.
 Do not draw attention just yet. As you get closer, smash the first soldier that questions you. Proceed to kill any in the immediate area before reinforcements can arrive.
 As you lead them away, they will pick up a gun. Take them back to the vehicle and drive away.
 Leave them in safety, and the danger meter will go back to green.

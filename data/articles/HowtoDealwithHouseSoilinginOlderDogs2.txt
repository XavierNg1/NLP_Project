 Only a trained veterinarian will be able to determine if your pet’s house soiling is due to a medical condition. You should have a regular vet already, but if you don’t, talk to a friend with a pet or contact a veterinary association for recommendations.The American Animal Hospital Association has a veterinarian database at https://www.aaha.org/pet_owner/about_aaha/hospital_search/default.aspx.
 If your dog is soiling the house more frequently, it could be due to any number of medical conditions. Your vet should be able to tell you what your pet’s specific condition is and how to solve it. Once your vet informs you of your pet’s condition, ask for resources to learn more about the condition. In addition to information your vet provides, check online and at your local library in order to learn how to best care for your pet. Conditions that might cause increased house soiling include:infections of the gut
kidney disease
kidney failure
urinary incontinence
diabetes mellitus

, Increased stress can cause a dog – no matter its age – to go to the toilet in the house. The most common source of stress is a change in your dog’s living conditions, especially the introduction of a new pet or baby. Think about recent changes you’ve made to your dog’s living arrangements. Pay special attention to changes that coincided with an increase in house soiling in your older dog. Remove these stressors if possible or find ways to relieve your dog’s stress such as:Provide an adequate amount of exercise for your dog. Take your dog for a walk. Give your dog an adequate amount of time to run around outside and explore (for instance, by letting your dog play in the yard).

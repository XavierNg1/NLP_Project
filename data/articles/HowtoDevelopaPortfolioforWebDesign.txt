Because you're developing a portfolio for web design, you want to avoid using templates.
Create your own unique design, but keep it clear and simple. Make the site easy-to-navigate and functional.
Put your logo at the top of each page and link it to your home page.
Write a tagline that says something about your work as a web designer and is catchy enough for people to remember. Include it beneath your logo.;

Whether you've worked for many different clients or have only finished a few student projects, you should feature your best work on your website.
Offer a screenshot of each website with a link through to the live website. If possible, add a description of each, as well as what the client's wishes were, and what approach you took in designing their sites.



Ask clients who were pleased with your work for some short testimonials. Request that they say something about your professional approach and conduct, as well as the results.
 If you've been featured in any publications either online or in print, include links to them or excerpts from the articles.
 If you maintain a blog that clearly demonstrates your expertise in the field of web design, link to it.
 This page should tell visitors to your site about you, your education, and your experience in web design. Though people generally like to hear a brief reference to your hobbies or interest, the main focus should be on web design.
 This should include the specifics of your web design, such as programming languages and software programs you use. If you do graphic design as a part of your web design, include that too.



Include your email address and phone number.
You can also create a contact form that allows the visitor to include some information about why they are contacting you.
 Link this to your contact page.

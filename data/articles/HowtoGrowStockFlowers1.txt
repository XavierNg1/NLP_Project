 The plants prefer full sun, but a garden bed with partial sun can work in a pinch. Do not prepare a garden bed in heavy shade., Begin in early April and sow seeds every two weeks through April and May. By sowing your seeds in rounds like this, you can enjoy the color and scent of these flowers longer than you would with a single early sowing.
 Ideally, the soil should be amended from the last season. If not, however, you can still amend it now by chopping it up with a rake or garden fork and adding a slow-release granular fertilizer, as well as a well-rotted compost.


If you have dense, compact soil, you may also wish to consider mixing in a little garden sand. Coarse garden sand improves the soil's ability to drain.
 As you rake it up, you should remove any weeds and large stones. Smaller pebbles should not cause any damage, but large stones can present obstacles for developing roots, and weeds can compete with your stock flowers for valuable nutrition.
, The rows should be about 7 to 12 inches (18 to 30 cm) apart.
 Thinly sprinkle the seeds over the sandy line, keeping them on the line or as close to the line as possible. By sowing the seeds in organized lines, you will have an easier time sowing additional rows of seeds later in the season.
 You can either sprinkle it over by hand or by using a rake. You only need to use about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) of light soil.
 Use a garden hose or watering can to apply a fine mist or gentle spray of water to the seeds to moisten the soil without washing the seeds away.

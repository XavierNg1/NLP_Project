 Cut them into small pieces and serve with fried cheese cubes.
 Try a dopiaza, Vindaloo or phal. Provide fried Indian bread ("chapattis"), rice, and yogurt on the side as well.
 Try, "Falooda." Take sweet noodles, basil seeds, vanilla ice-cream and rose colored milk and mix them in a cup. The taste is great.,

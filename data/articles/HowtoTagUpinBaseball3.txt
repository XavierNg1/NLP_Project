 Tagging from first is done rarely, because second base is so close to all three outfielders. It's easier for them to complete the throw before a runner can make it to second., Unless the ball has been hit quite deeply (to or near the warning track if there is one), don't try to tag from first. Let your first-base coach help you make that decision.

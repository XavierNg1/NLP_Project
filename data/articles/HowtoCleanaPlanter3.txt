 Replace soil between plantings, especially in containers and especially from plants that are disease-prone.
 It’s a good idea to disinfect digging and pruning tools occasionally using a weak bleach solution (about one part bleach to ten parts water).
 Burn any diseased plant material, or throw it out with household trash. Never compost any plant matter showing signs of disease. Once a plant shows signs of disease, remove it, remove the surrounding soil and do not plant the same variety in that spot again.


Prune off any diseased growth from living plants.
 Plants growing in the right conditions for their variety are more resistant to disease. If plants are stressed (for example, getting too little water) they are more susceptible.
 Circulating air between plants is healthier than crowding. When pruning, try to remove congestion from the heart of a shrub by removing crowded growth.
 When purchasing plants, try to buy varieties resistant to the most common diseases for that type of plant. You’ll often see this marked on the nursery label using abbreviations such as ‘VF’, meaning that the plant has enhanced resistance to Verticillium and Fusarium wilts.


You might also see ‘PM’, meaning that the plant has resistance to powdery mildew. You don’t need to memorize all these abbreviations but if you are finding a particular disease is a problem in your garden, look for varieties resistant to it.
 Avoid planting the same species in an area year after year, especially if it encounters disease issues. Diseases can build up their presence in soil over time, meaning a mild attack one year can affect the crop with increasing severity over the next planting seasons.


If you have a disease problem, change your planting completely and avoid planting the same variety in that area. Ideally avoid planting related plants as they too may be susceptible. If you are determined to continue the same planting scheme in that area, remove the soil to a good depth before replanting.

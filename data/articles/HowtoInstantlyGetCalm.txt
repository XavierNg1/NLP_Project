 Studies have shown that our breaths have more power than we think they do. In fact, a deep, relaxing breath instantly cool your mind down and help keep it from getting more into the negative. So, if possible, take some several deep breaths, slowly and comfortably, and feel as the air moving in and out your lungs. Close your eyes if you want.;
, ...or the fear/worry etc, any negative feelings that you're in. Be conscious of it, aware that it is within you. If you do it correctly, you will feel it dissolving.
 Sounds have a strong effect on our state of mind. Listen to some soothing music, such as instrumental/acoustic or sounds of water stream, sea waves, or bird singing etc., would be helpful.
 Do something healthy to burst out. Holding anger within is like sitting on a fire: you can't do anything else with much effectiveness. If none of the above tips work for you (they rarely fail, though), then you should release it in a healthy way, with some inanimate objects. Doing things like bunching a pillow till you sweat all over out, or writing it out, or find some place where there are no people and shout out as much as you want. Sounds like crazy but it helps, indeed.

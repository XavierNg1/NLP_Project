 Regular tape tabs on diapers are small and easy for a child to pull off with a single tug. However, covering the diaper tape tabs with stronger tape makes this more difficult.


Although it does not matter what type of tape is used, some parents prefer clear packing tape because it is not noticeable by the toddler or other people. The main thing to look for when choosing tape for this method is that it sticks very well.
It is also best if the tape is 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 to 5.1 cm) wide so that it totally covers the diaper tabs.
 For some toddlers, putting a piece of stronger tape over each of the tabs is all that is necessary, but there are others who are only slightly deterred by this.


In these cases, it might be necessary for the parent to place a longer strip of tape all the way around the top of the diaper.
 To be sure that the toddler cannot pick at the end of the tape and remove it, the parent should make sure the end is in the back where the toddler cannot see it.
 It is also important to leave a small margin of the diaper above the tape. This keeps the tape from getting stuck to the toddler’s skin, where it can be painful to remove.

 If you are worried about exposing younger children to images of violence you can draw a snowman instead of a hanging. Start with three circles for the body, then add add eyes, nose, and buttons for each wrong answer. The rest of the rules remain the same., This game works best with longer words or phrases. The rules are the same with one crucial exception: every other letter you guess should not be in the secret word. The player needs to alternate guessing letters that are in the word (the "in" round) and letters that are not in the word (the "out" round) until they win or lose.


If the player says a letter that is in the secret word the host writes it in regardless of the round the player is in. If they guess a letter that is in the word while on the "out" round, they still get a strike, however.
To make this easier, the host can write out every letter of the alphabet and cross them out as they become eliminated.You can play "In and Out" by yourself online.
 Hangman can be a great tool for teachers to get their students engaged in learning new words. To make it truly effective, however, add an additional rule: when the students guess the secret word, they have to know the definition of it to win.

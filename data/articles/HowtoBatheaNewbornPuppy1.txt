 Mothers usually care for newborn puppies including keeping them very clean. If at all possible leave the bathing of a newborn puppy to its mother for the first four weeks.


Newborn puppies do not really need to be bathed at all, so resist the urge to try to bathe them.;
, Make sure to keep the space for the mother and puppies clean.Line the space with newspapers, cloth, or towels and change them regularly.
Use a material that does not contain dyes or chemicals.
The mother will take care of all the feeding and removing waste for the first month or so. Just give her a nice clean space.
 Check to make sure the mother cleans her puppies. In rare cases a mother may abandon or neglect some puppies. Only clean a newborn puppy if the mother is not cleaning it herself.

 You always want to make sure you are putting the proper accent over the word, as sometimes an alternate accent can give some words an entirely different meaning. These are some of the common accents used by most European languages:


Grave accents – à, è, ì, ò, ù
Acute accents – á, é, í, ó, ú, ý
Circumflex accents – â, ê, î, ô, û
Tilde accents – ñ, õ, ã
Umlaut accents – ä, ë, ï, ö, ü, ÿ

, You can pull text from an existing text file, the character map or viewer utility on your computer, or by searching online. If you search a word that normally uses the accent on your search engine, you should be able to quickly copy a sample of the entire word.
 Right-click on your PC to copy the text. Hit Command + C to copy if you are using a Mac.
 If you are using a Mac, you can select the "paste and match style" option by right-clicking if you want the accent or accented word to match the rest of your text. If you are using a PC, just highlight the word once you've pasted it and change the font so it matches the rest of your document. If you rarely use accents, or you just want a quick solution, this can be the most efficient method to create accents quickly.

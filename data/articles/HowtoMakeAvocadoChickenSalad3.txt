 Add 1 ripe avocado that’s been seeded and peeled to a medium bowl. With a fork, mash the avocado until it is mostly smooth., Once the avocado is smooth, add 1 cup (140 g) of finely chopped, cooked chicken, 1 apple that’s been peeled, cored, and finely chopped, ¼ cup (55 g) of finely chopped celery, and ¼ cup (40 g) of finely chopped red onion to the bowl. Stir the mixture well with the fork so all of the ingredients are fully combined.Any type of apple will work in the salad.
If there are other vegetables that you like, feel free to mix them into the salad.
 After you’ve mixed the chicken, fruit, and veggies into the avocado, add 2 tablespoons (6 g) of finely chopped cilantro, 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of lime juice, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of kosher salt, and a pinch of freshly ground black pepper to the bowl. Use the fork to mix well until the ingredients are fully incorporated.You can substitute a 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lemon juice for the lime juice if you prefer.
You can substitute chopped parsley for the cilantro if you prefer.
If the salad seems too dry, you can mix in 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 ml) of olive oil to loosen it.
 When the salad is fully mixed, spread it over your favorite sandwich bread or toast. You can also serve the salad on top of a bed of greens, such as arugula or watercress.Store any leftover avocado chicken salad in a bowl, and cover it tightly with plastic wrap so none of it is exposed to the air. It should keep for 1 to 2 days in the refrigerator.

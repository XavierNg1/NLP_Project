Take the object outside and use a dry cloth to wipe off as much mold/mildew as possible. Dip the cloth in a soap solution (regular dish soap will do fine). Wring it out as much as possible.

If soapy water is not effective, try using a mixture of bleach or vinegar and water.
If there are multiple pages, be sure to spread them apart so that they do not stick together. It is a good idea to put the book or paper by a fan to speed up the drying process. To further ensure that the pages to not stick together, sprinkle some corn starch between each page while the book/paper is drying. Brush the cornstarch away once it is dry.

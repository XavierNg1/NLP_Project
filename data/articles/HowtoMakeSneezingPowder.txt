 Gather all the spices that are on hand and smell them all. Do any irritate the nose? Do any trigger sneezing? Keep a list of the spices that are irritating.;
, Make sure the powder is potent by adding the most irritating spice in large ratios, while the least irritating spice in smaller proportions.
 Mash the mixture for about ten minutes, making sure the spices are a fine powder.
 This step can be done with a funnel or a folded paper plate.
 Sprinkle a little on your hand and rub your nose. Did the spices trigger a sneeze? Test the spices on a few more people before the decision is made to keep the powder or to restart.

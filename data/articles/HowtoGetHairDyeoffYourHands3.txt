 Apply it to your nails immediately after you get the dye off the skin, before the dye has a chance to penetrate too deeply.









Nail beds are mostly dead skin cells that absorb dye easily. Without actually removing the dead cells, it may be very difficult to lift the dye.
Rub the cotton ball on your nails and you should see the dye start to come off on the cotton ball.
 If you have dead skin or cuticles that changed colors because of the dye, use a cuticle clipper to carefully remove the skin. This will save you from using harsh nail polish remover on your skin.
 If you're having trouble cleaning the skin under your nails, use a clean toothbrush or a nail brush to scrub underneath.









Try soaking the brush in soap and water to wash away any dye that is under your nails.
 If you've tried everything and your nails are still discolored, your best bet is to cover them with a fun nail polish. Be fashionable and disguise the stain at the same time!

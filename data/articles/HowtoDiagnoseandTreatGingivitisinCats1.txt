 To check your cat's gums, sit down with the cat. Tip their head back, and part their lips with a finger so that you can see their gums. Typically, gingivitis will cause redness and swelling around the gum line. You may also notice some plaque build-up on their teeth. This will appear as a yellowish discoloration on the tooth itself.The cat may not like having their gums inspected. If they struggle, let them go, and try again later.
While you look at their teeth, you can soothe your cat by petting and talking to them.
If the swelling appears severe, see a vet immediately. Your cat may have a later stage of gingivitis, or it may be periodontitis.;
, Bad breath is usually one of the first signs of gingivitis. Smell your cat’s breath. If it smells foul or bad, it may be a sign that there is something wrong with their teeth, gums, or mouth. Make an appointment with a vet., Gingivitis can cause soreness in the cat’s mouth, but the cat may not show many signs that they are in pain. Watch to see if the cat is frequently pawing at their face. If their gums hurt, they may also be refusing to eat hard foods or dry kibble. These are signs that something might be wrong., All cats can develop gingivitis. That said, there are certain factors that may increase their risk. If these apply to your cat, you may want to visit your vet for more frequent dental cleanings.


Older cats or cats with crowded teeth may develop gingivitis more easily than other cats.
Cats with diabetes, feline leukemia (FeLV), or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) may be at higher risk of developing gingivitis.Some purebred cats, such as Abyssinians, Siamese, Maine Coons, Persians, and Somalis, may be at higher risk, although all breeds can get gingivitis.

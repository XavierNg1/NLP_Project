 Buying the card this way ensures that the gift card for that station will be available (unless they’re sold out), and you won’t have to go out of your way to hunt it down at a big-box retailer or other store.
 Most major gas stations offer online gift card purchases. Additionally, you can often find discounted gift cards online at sites like Gift Card Granny.These sites offer, for instance, a $100 gift card for $99 or less. Look for good deals online and buy your card there to save.
 Many big-box retailers and grocery stores offer gas cards for sale.If you’re shopping at a store that sells gas gift cards and you want or need one, choosing to buy one at one of these stores can be convenient. Be sure you know what gas station the person you’re buying the card for patronizes before making your purchase.


Sometimes you can “buy” a gas gift card by spending a certain amount of money at a given store. For instance, sometimes grocery stores offer free gift cards in $10 amounts if you purchase $50 worth of groceries. If you’re going to buy groceries anyway, you might as well get the gift card along with everything else. Buy canned goods that won’t spoil if you’re having trouble hitting the minimum purchase price.
Check to see if there is an extra charge on top of the cost of the actual money you’re putting on the card. Usually, there isn’t unless the card is of a low (less than $25) value. If there is, shop elsewhere for the gas gift card so you don’t have to pay the extra fee.
 The number is usually listed online through the gas station’s website. You might be able to obtain the phone number from employees at your local branch of the gas station, too. If you want to buy your card from home but don’t feel comfortable making a purchase online, this is probably the way to go.

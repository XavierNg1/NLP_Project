 If you have a very large, open backyard, consider fencing in a portion to keep your dog out of trouble and away from skunks.
 Skunks seek human garbage, so use garbage cans with tightly fitting lids. This helps prevent the odors from tempting skunks and other animals.
 You can buy special deterrents online or at garden supply stores to protect your yard from skunk invasion.
 Skunks may try to live under decks or other structures around your home. To prevent this, seal any openings large enough for a skunk.
 If you know you have a skunk problem around your yard or neighborhood, contact your local animal control. Depending on where you live, they may set traps or offer to come deal with the animals if you set your own traps.

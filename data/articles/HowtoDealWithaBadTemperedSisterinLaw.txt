 Are you misinterpreting the signals that she is sending out? Could you be overreacting? Ensure that the source of the problem is not you before jumping to conclusions.;
, Is she mad at you because she thinks that you do not deserve her sibling? Did you do something in the past that caused her to lose faith in you?

, Your sister-in-law may not like you at all, but you have a responsibility to resolve the conflict to avoid family drama. You do not have to prove yourself to your sister-in-law, but attempt to explain your motives and reasons for past actions. Show her that you are a responsible husband/wife to her sibling, and demonstrate care and compassion even when she embarrasses you in front of family.
 Explain to your wife/husband that his/her sister is treating you poorly, and attempt to get your spouse to talk with her.
 One must vent, and not hold in pain, that has even been confirmed by professionals.

 If you're trying to install more than what your car originally came with, the same rules should be applied to those of subs.
 Because most speakers are rated to 8 ohms, you can generally connect many speaker to one amp without any problems.
 All cars have pre-wired powers and grounds that go through the doors and the back dash. It would be foolish to run multiple wires through your door and dash to play multiple speakers with such low wattage.
 Just make sure the power and ground are positioned properly throughout the process.

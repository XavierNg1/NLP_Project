, Use the grommet tool to punch a grommet into each corner of the drop cloth. Follow the grommet tool's instruction manual.
 Screw 2 screw eyes into the wall. Place the screw eyes where the back 2 corners of the canopy will be.



Use thin metal, wooden or bamboo poles in the height of your choice and at least 1 3/8 inches (.95 cm) wide. If the poles lack a pin or anchor on top, drill a hole into the top of each pole. Make the hole big enough to hold a dowel pin.
Slide a dowel pin into each hole.
 Use sturdy cords to tie the 2 back grommets to the screw eyes.



Gather 2 assistants.
Place a grommet over the top of each pole.
Have each assistant wind the cord through the grommet and around the dowel pin.
Tie the cords tightly.
Direct the assistants to place the bottom of their poles into the ground. Place the poles at the front corners where the canopy will stand.



Have the 2 assistants wind 1 end of a strong cord around the top of each pole.
Instruct the assistants to wind the other end of their cords around a tent stake.
Direct the assistants to place their stakes in the ground. The cord running from the pole to the stake should be taut. The assistants should place their stakes in the ground at the same time to achieve a balanced structure.
Hammer the stakes into the ground.

 Before making your mashed potatoes, you should preheat your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (about 164 degrees Celsius). If you have a gas oven, it's a good idea to use an oven thermometer to make sure your oven's at the right heat., Place your potatoes in a large pot and cover them with slightly salted water. Bring the water to a boil and then allow the potatoes to cook for about 15 minutes. The potatoes should be tender when they're ready. You may have to cook them slightly longer than 15 minutes depending on the precise heat of your stove.Drain the pot once the potatoes are cooked.
Use a large fork, a potato masher, or an electronic mixer to mash the potatoes until they're smooth.
 Measure out the cream cheese, sour cream, milk, onion salt, and pepper. Add these to your mashed potatoes and mix everything together until your potatoes are smooth., Place your potatoes in a large casserole dish. Cover the dish and place it in the oven. Allow the potatoes to cook for 50 minutes. You can then place the dish in your refrigerator and reheat it later., Spoon your potatoes into a nonstick sauce pan. Place it on the stove over medium heat.Stir the potatoes every two minutes.
Cook them for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they're warm throughout.
If your potatoes get thick, add heated milk or cream.

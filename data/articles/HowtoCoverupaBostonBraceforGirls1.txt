 Tight clothing will make the brace more noticeable. To cover the brace, buy larger shirts and dresses that will show fewer of the details of the brace through the fabric.Baby doll t-shirts are perfect, as they're very loose and cover up the brace.
Tunic tops paired with leggings are a good choice because the top will flow over the brace instead of clinging to it.
Empire waist tops and shift dresses are also good choices because they give plenty of space around your torso.;
, Patterns can hide the details of the brace by drawing the eye to the pattern itself rather than what's underneath. Some good patterns for this include floral, stripes, plaid, or polka dots.
 Layering is a great technique for covering up a brace. Wear a T-shirt or tank top as the bottom layer. For the top layer try cardigans, blazers, or jackets, depending on the weather. When you layer your tops, choose an undershirt in a similar color to your brace so it blends in. Avoid contrasting colors that won't show as well under other tops.
 For casual days, loungewear, or workouts, oversized hoodies or sweatshirts are great choices because they are comfortable and will hide your brace well. Pair them with fitted pants or jeans for a polished look and to balance out the oversized top.
 If you live in a warm climate, wearing a brace under your clothes can make you uncomfortably hot and sweaty. Buy clothing made of cotton or a cotton-blend, so you can stay cool.

Never use metal on a non-stick pan. The metal can scrape away the sides, resulting in microscopic bits of the pan getting into your food. Always use a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula.

If you like runny porridge, add a splash of more milk or water until it looks like you pictured it. If you’re making for a group, let each person add more liquid as they see fit to their individual serving once it's all in bowls.
 Most people like to start out with a sweet base to work with. Some people even add butter! As your porridge is finishing, consider adding a few touches to everyone’s dish. Just a tablespoon or so of each ought to do it.


If you're trying to watch your sugar intake or prefer a more savory dish, skip this part. You can always add in whatever you like, later, too.

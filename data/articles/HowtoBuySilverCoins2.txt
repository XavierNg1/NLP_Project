Verify the length of time that the dealer has been in business. A measurable business history means that the dealer is more likely to be experienced and reliable.
Work with a dealer who offers a variety of coins. If silver coins lose value or if you decide to expand your investment options, this will save you the trouble of finding a new dealer.
 Choosing a dealer who is authorized by the U.S. Mint gives you an extra level of assurance and security.


Know that most Authorized Purchasers have been in business for at least 5 years and have a well-established wholesale network.
Rest assured that Authorized Purchasers have had a full financial audit by an independent Certified Public Accounting firm recognized by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
Know that Authorized Purchasers are well capitalized. These dealers must have a net worth of $10 million for at least 3 fiscal years.
 You should go into the price negotiation knowing that the U.S. Mint charges dealers $2 per coin as a purchase premium. Expect the dealer to charge you a reasonable premium on top of the price of silver.
 The one exception to this rule would be making online purchases from the U.S. Mint.

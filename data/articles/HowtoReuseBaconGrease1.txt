 Nothing like good old bacon smokiness to jazz up a pot of beans. Although eating bacon grease may not be heart healthy (or thigh healthy) it is awfully tasty and cuts down on the amount of salt needed to enhance the beanâ€™s flavor.;
, Whether you are making homemade French fries or whole sliced potatoes, coating the bottom of your pan with bacon grease adds an entirely new dimension of flavor to a humdrum spud.
 Your dog (or cat) will go wild having a little bacon grease drizzled over his kibble. Not only will he love the taste, the grease will add an extra shine to his coat.
 Hang from a tree or simply lay on your back porch--if you grease it, they will come!

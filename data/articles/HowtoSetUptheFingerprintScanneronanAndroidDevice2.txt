 The fingerprint scanner on the HTC One Max is located at the back of the device, right below the ultrapixel camera. The placement of the scanner makes it easier to use with the index finger, allowing you to unlock your device with a downward swipe of a finger., Tap on the Settings icon, which is typically a gear icon, to access the Settings menu.


You may also do this from the app drawer, which you can access by tapping on the Apps icon and looking for the Setting icon, then tapping from there.
 Under “Personal” in the Settings menu, locate the “Fingerprint Scan” icon; it is a blue circular icon with a white fingerprint in the middle.


If you haven’t yet set up a fingerprint, it will not ask for a scan. If you have, however, it will require you to use a registered finger and scan it to access this menu.
 Tap the plus icon with the text “Learn new fingerprint” to register a new finger. Tap on “Continue” at the lower right when an introductory screen comes up, and tap a finger on one of the hands that appear on the screen.


Swipe the finger you selected over the scanner at the back four times. Each successful scan will make the device vibrate briefly.
 Now that you have registered a finger, you can now set what the device will do after detecting that particular finger. Tap “OK” in the notification that comes up, and then tap on a circle opposite “Unlock,” “Camera,” “Home,” “Voice Assistant,” or “Choose from all apps.”


The last option (Choose from all apps) will let you choose a specific app that will open after you swipe that particular finger over the sensor.
Tap “Apply” when you are finished to finalize the setting.
The fingerprint scanner will not work if the screen is locked. You must first press the Power button to reach the lock screen, and then swipe your finger over the scanner.

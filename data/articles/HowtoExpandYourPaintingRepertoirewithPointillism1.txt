 You will need a sheet of watercolor paper from a pad for practice. You'll also need an ordinary number 2 pencil, colored markers in various shades, including neutrals, grays, browns and black.
 On scrap paper, create a series of dots close together to form a dark area. Hold the paper away from you and see if they are close enough to appear as a spot of black. Now, space them further apart and make them a lighter tone to form a gray area. Continue playing with dots making them further apart until they fade to white., Angle your pencil slightly and rub to make a patch of gray tone. Then, lighten it as you work paler and paler until it goes to white.,, Try mixing the dots to see if you can create green and violet when viewed at a distance.

 We all work better when a schedule is in place because we adjust all we do in a day to fit into that schedule. By anticipating that moment in time, we mentally prepare ourselves for when it arrives. This can work in your favor when it comes to getting your child motivated for the activity. It may be met with resistance at first, but over time it simply becomes the standard routine.
 By incorporating the entire family into the activity it becomes easier for the children to adapt to being forced to exercise. This eliminates any chances of the children feeling singled out and being forced to endure an activity that no one else has to participate in. It is easier for children to accept doing something they prefer not to do if they feel that everyone else has to do it too.
 Your child will be less resistant to the idea of physical activity if it appears to be more of a special event. Incorporating a friend into the routine will turn it into an event the child actually looks forward to. An added bonus can be that when the routine is over the children get to play.
 Children naturally like to prove to others their competency. By betting them that they canâ€™t do something, they will be more motivated to try to prove to you that they can. Be sure to approach this in a fun, joking manner so as not to discourage them from exercise.
 Children love to be able to compare their progress over time and to try to surpass themselves. Make it a family chart and children will become competitive with the others on the chart. The end result is that they push themselves to do better.

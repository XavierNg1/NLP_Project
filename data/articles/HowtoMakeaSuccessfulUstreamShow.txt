, Whether you want to stream news, commentary, games, or anything, make sure it's something you will want to do every time you broadcast.
 Ustream Producer is a good one to help create your show. Three types of cameras are commonly used: video cameras, webcams, and virtual webcams. Video cameras and webcams can be useful, depending on your show. Virtual webcams show the computer screen. I would recommend ManyCam for this, as you can turn the watermark off under the "Text and Video" tab. You can also do PinP, or Picture in Picture, with both ManyCam and Producer.
 Once you have the hang of it, you will start attracting regular viewers.
 Do some big events, and advertise these. Make videos, and post some important ones on YouTube. Use programs such as Skype to add other people (even viewers!) to the show, and connect with other streamers.

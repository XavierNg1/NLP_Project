Grudge matches are where you play against other people.
Mini challenge, as the name suggests, you play a mini challenge against the ai.



Skills competition is where you have to mag the red targets and the green targets for bonus points. Green is better than red. Avoid blue, as that is the enemy's target.
Dragon-Human duel is where you have to use the gear along the path in order to take down the rider. You could also keep to the wall, that is, keep them to the outside of the path so they crash into the walls holding the gear.

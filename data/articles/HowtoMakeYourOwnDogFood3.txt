 Make sure your hands are clean before combining. The consistency of the mixture will be chunky, but it should stick together due to the raw meat and eggs.
 Shape each part into a loaf. Place the loaves into the roasting pan from earlier. Then, cover the pan with a lid.
 If you're using a meat thermometer, the internal temperature should be 175˚F when finished.Then allow to cool.
 Feed 1/4 to 1/3 of a loaf per 10 pounds of dog.This dog food can also be given alongside kibble, to vary and supplement your dog's diet., Keep in mind that when you're using natural ingredients, the food spoils easily so you must just make enough food that could last for a span of a few days - depending on the shelf-life of the ingredients.

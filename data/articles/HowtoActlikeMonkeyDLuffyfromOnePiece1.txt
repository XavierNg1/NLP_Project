Wear a straw hat. Straw hats such as Luffy's are typically available at craft stores.
If the rim is too big of floppy, use something sharp (such as an X-Acto knife) to make the rim smaller.
Wrap some red ribbon around it.
Fasten some cord around it so you can hang it around your neck.
Draw a scar under your left eye using a fine tip marker.;

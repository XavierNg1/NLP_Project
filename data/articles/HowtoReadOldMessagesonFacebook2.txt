 Locate the app on your mobile device. It has an app icon of a dialogue balloon with a zigzag on it. Tap on it.
 The left panel, or the main window if your screen is small, contains your list of conversations. The messages here are sorted with the most recent conversations at the top. Each conversation is identified by the person or group you were in a conversation with. The last message date is also indicated beside each message.
 Swipe up on the list of conversations to scroll through them. You can go back to years of conversations here. Everything is stored. When you reach the bottom of the current batch, the next batch of older messages will be loaded automatically, until you reach the very end or the very first conversation youâ€™ve had on Facebook.
 When you find the old conversation you want to review, tap on it. The whole conversation thread will open on the right panel, or on the main window if your screen is small. You can see and read everything you talked about, from the very first time you started that particular thread with the same person or the same group.

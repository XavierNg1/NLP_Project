 After the breakup it is necessary to minimize contact for awhile. This does not mean that you should completely ignore the person, as it will lead to hurt feelings. Instead try to create some space and time, so you both can heal. But if something (not break up related) comes up, feel free to share it with them. This way you are maintaining a dynamic without the intensity.;
, If that is not possible, try to attach a positive emotion to it, but instead of a romantic one, try to think of it as something a friend or family member would have given you. This will also help with shifting your feelings for the person.Take some time for yourself to go through both the good and the bad moments together. Really decide if this person is someone who you want to be friends with. If you truly feel that you do want to be ONLY friends, then you should re-establish contact again. During this time work on yourself too and do things that make you happy.
 It is important to find a time frame that works for both of you. When that time is up, make contact with the other person (decide who will contact whom), and carefully ask them how they are doing. If either of you needs more time, then give it.
 Don't let them find out from someone else, because that will definitely be the end of the friendship. But you must also realize that just because you were friends before, you can not discuss the details of your new relationship with them, as it would hurt too much. You may find you will never be able to do this again without jealousy coming from one of you.
 It takes time to heal, so keep that in mind. All you can do is be patient. But you may find that you have both grown apart, or don't have anything left to give. If that the case, then that is okay. Just remember the good times, what you've learned, and move on. Sometimes the best thing really is to let go, and let other opportunities come your way.

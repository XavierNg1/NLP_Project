 To properly make egg fried rice, the rice needs to be cold. This prevents the rice from sticking together.Many suggest to cook the rice the day before, or use left over rice from previous meals. Some suggest to cook it hours beforehand and refrigerate since the reason to use day-old rice is because it needs to be cold.Decide how many hours ahead of time you would like to cook the rice. Just make sure to place it in the refrigerator for a few hours before starting.
 Take the rice out of the refrigerator when you are ready to cook it. In a bowl, add 1 tablespoon of oil to rice. Work the oil into the rice with your hands or a spoon, evenly coating the rice. Transfer the rice to a colander and drain while you proceed to the next steps.
 Combine eggs and salt in a small bowl and gently whisk until blended. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok. Add whisked eggs and cumin seeds to wok. Stir frequently, working the eggs to a scramble.


When eggs are mostly solid but still soft, remove from wok. The desired texture is slightly more liquid than that of scrambled eggs. Set aside.
Add more or less cumin seeds to taste.
 Heat the remaining oil in the wok. If desired, you can recycle some of the oil that drained from the rice. Add the garlic and onion to the wok. Stir-fry together over high heat for about 5 minutes or until the onion looks transparent, but is not soft. Add the rice, eggs, soy sauce, chili sauce, vinegar, and celery. Mix together, continuing to stir-fry over high heat for 1-2 minutes while stirring frequently.


Stir-frying is a cooking method where small pieces of food are quickly cooked in a small amount of hot oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. It helps veggies retain their color, crunch, and nutrients. Cook until the vegetables are crisp-tender., Spoon onto a plate. Recipe makes 2-3 servings.

 Every hotel room has an evacuation map inside the hotel room door; take note of the nearest stairways and exit points, as well as nearby fire alarms and extinguishers.


Take note of any designated emergency assembly points located outside the hotel.
 Possible reasons for this include:


Neighbors or anybody else in the hallway that makes you feel uneasy.
The room is located in a poorly lit or little-traveled area, or you have to pass through such an area to get to it.
The room is on the ground floor and you don't feel the windows are secure against intruders.
Locks and doors between adjoining rooms do not feel secure.
You don't feel confident in your ability to evacuate the room in case of emergency.
A general feeling of unease--trust your intuition.
 Use the deadbolt and safety chain.


Never open the door unless you're absolutely sure who's on the other side. If maintenance, delivery or other people knock unexpectedly, call the front desk to ask for verification or assistance.
 If you store them in the main safe, get a receipt for the stored items.



Be aware that putting the "Maid Service Required" sign on your doorknob makes it obvious that the room is vacant.



Sign in with your first initial and last name only; giving your full first name makes it easy for snoopers to identify your gender.

 If you don't want to use a whole trash can, you can use an empty bucket or an empty cat litter container, and make it a designated cat waste can. It's important that you remember to set up the trash receptacle close to the litter box, so that you don't risk scattering waste or litter across the floor., Some experts recommend wearing disposable gloves and a dust mask to prevent the spread of toxoplasmosis, a virus that some cats carry which is transmitted through fecal matter.Even if you don't directly handle the feces, cleaning the litter box can cause dust to fly in the air, which can irritate the lungs and may lead to transmission of toxoplasmosis.
 Cat feces should be scooped out at least once every day.Some experts even recommend scooping out solid wastes twice a day for a really clean box.If you let solid wastes build up in the litter box, your cat may refuse to use the litter box, even if the litter was only changed a few days ago.


Use a special scooper, available at most pet stores. These scoopers have a grated bottom, so you can collect solid waste while the surrounding litter falls through the grates and back into the litter box.
 If you use clumping litter, your cat's urine should form solid clumps of litter. These should be scooped on a daily basis, just like feces.If you don't use clumping litter, sprinkle a layer of baking soda at the bottom of the litter box, before you pour in the litter. This can help absorb the odors from cat urine that might get missed during daily scooping., If you're scooping the box out on a daily basis, there's a chance you might have lost some of the litter, either because it stuck to your cat's waste or because it simply spilled out during cleaning or use. Topping off your cat's litter every few days can help keep the box clean and appealing to your cat.

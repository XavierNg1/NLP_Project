 An old pill bottle, a film container, a plastic bottle of Coca-Cola, whatever you have lying around (with a lid!) will do. Be sure to wash it first, though; you'll be putting the side of the bottle in your mouth.


One hole needs to be centered on the bottom and the other centered on the side.
A 5/16" drill bit is best for a standard pen, but it can vary. Choose a drill bit that matches the width of your pen, as the pen will be inserted through the hole shortly.;
, You know, the kind they give you at hotels and seminars for free. A straight-tubed, not fancy, ballpoint pen with no frills. There are three steps to this:


Unscrew the cap surrounding the ink point.
Take out the guts -- the ink, the spring -- to create an empty barrel for your BBs to fly through.
Ram out the lid at the top with a screwdriver or other slim, pointed object.

A sturdy straw will also do the trick.
 It should protrude about 1/2" (1.25 cm) into the inside of the container. A regular pen should fit fairly snugly into a hole drilled with a 5/16" bit.


It's a good idea to hot glue the barrel to the bottom of the medicine bottle. Just put a ring of glue around the pen where it meets the edge of the container. This way no air will escape, pressurizing your BBs.
 A little less than half full is ideal.
 Experiment with distance and aim -- you should be able to go a considerable distance away (the length of your garage, say) and still maintain direction and velocity.


Do not inhale with your mouth up against the container. You could inhale pellets and choke. Instead, take a breath away from the gun and then blow inside.

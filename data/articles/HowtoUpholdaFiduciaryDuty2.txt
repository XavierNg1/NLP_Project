 The concept of acting in good faith means the intention to act honestly and fairly. It also means that the director is not acting to defraud. A director should not have any ulterior motives for working with the corporation. An example of acting in bad faith is knowingly lying to other board members or shareholders or wrongfully withholding information. If an officer or director is proven to have acted in bad faith, the company may sue the officer or director for any damages caused to the company as a result of the director or officerâ€™s bad faith.
 A director must act reasonably in making decisions on behalf of the company. This does not mean that the director has to make the right decision every time. Sometimes a director may use the utmost care in making a decision but the deal may not turn out well. That does not mean that the director violated his or her fiduciary duty of care. A violation of this duty may result from completely failing to oversee the board, or not reviewing a contract before entering into it. Upholding this duty means actively participating in the business of the company. Staying engaged in board meetings, seeking reports for committees that the director is not a member of, keeping good records and reviewing them often, and investigating any business transactions before they are entered into are all examples of upholding the duty of care.

 Pinch it between your thumb on one side (either the face or back) and your middle and ring fingers (your "inner fingers") together on the opposite (either the face or back).This trick will be much easier to perform with your dominant hand. However, with practice, you may be able to use your non-dominant hand instead.
This trick will not work if your audience is on all sides. You need to make sure the back of your hand can be obscured.;
, Try to grip the card using only the sides of your fingers as tight as you can. Bend the card into a slight arc that is convex in relation to your fingers. Simultaneously, curl your inner fingers by retracting them behind the card. The sections of your inner fingers between your first and second knuckles should be roughly parallel to the card., Straightening your fingers while maintaining your grip will bring the card to the back of your hand. Show your open palm to your audience, but be sure to keep your ring, middle, and index fingers held close together.It will take some practice to make it so the edges of the card do not show through at all. Try to only let the card get halfway down the crevices of your fingers.
 Now that your card has "disappeared," you can even more easily appear to conjure it from thin air. Simply curl your middle fingers forward again and pinch it between your thumb and index finger.Run through these steps as quickly as you can. The faster you move, the more convincing your sleight of hand will be.
Once you've gotten the hang of doing this basic trick, try adding movements with your wrists. This will work to misdirect your audience and disguise your moves.

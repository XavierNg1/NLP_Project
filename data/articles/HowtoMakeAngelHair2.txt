 Place the skillet on a burner and thoroughly heat the oil.
 Place the onion in the hot oil and Saut√© the pieces until they are translucent.
 Stir it in with the onions and cook one minute more.
 Stir in the tomatoes, salt and pepper, and chili flakes, and reduce the heat so that the ingredients come to a low simmer. Cover the skillet and let the sauce cook for 20 minutes.
 Fill the pot about 3/4 full, and put in a few pinches of salt.
 If necessary, break them so all the noodles fit.
 This is the state at which the pasta is fully cooked, but still has a good texture, and hasn't become too mushy. It should take 5 - 10 minutes.
 Place a colander or strainer over the sink. Pour the pasta into the colander or strainer to drain the water. Transfer the pasta to a large bowl.
 Pour the sauce from the skillet into the bowl with the pasta. Use tongs to toss the mixture.
 Serve with extra tomato sauce and Parmesan cheese.

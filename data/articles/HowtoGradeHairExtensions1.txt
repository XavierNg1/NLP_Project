 All graded hair extensions (1A and up) should be composed of 100% human hair. Unfortunately, many companies may include strands of animal or synthetic fibers. The best way to determine if hair is 100% human is to look for cuticle scales under a microscope. You can also test for synthetic fibers by seeing if the hair is easily damaged (melts) by heat styling., "Remy hair" refers to 100% human hair extensions in which the strands are arranged in a unilateral cuticle direction. Remy hair is collected in such a way that strands of hair stay aligned in the direction they grew. For instance, this can mean holding the hair in a ponytail and cutting it off.Keeping the cuticles in the same direction reduces tangles and helps hair to last longer.
If the hair becomes matted in 2-3 weeks, you will know that it's not real Remy.
 Virgin hair is 100% human Remy hair that has never been chemically treated or processed. This is the highest quality hair you can buy. There are essentially six ways to verify that what you have purchased is authentic virgin hair.These are:


The presence of split ends. If there are zero split ends, this means the hair has been acid washed.
You can feel the cuticle. If you hold a strand between your fingers and slide your hand down, it should be smooth. If you try to move the other direction, you should feel tiny ridges.
The hair will often be lighter at the tips than at the roots (though not always).
The hair that is stitched to the track and reversed (often called the mustache or beard) is very soft.
The hair has not been coated with silicone. It should not have a shiny residue.
It smells like hair. The chemicals used to disguise non-Virgin hair smell a bit like corn chips.

 Using your forefinger and thumb, grab your upper eyelid and gently pull straight outwards (not up or down). Be sure to grab the outer ridge of skin on your eyelid, not just your eyelash, as this may lead to you pulling out some eyelashes., Using the forefinger of your other hand, gently press down on the center of your eyelid as you continue to hold it out. This requires some good coordination, so be careful not to poke your eye. It may take a couple tries to get it right -- but keep at it!, With your eyelid clasped between your forefinger and thumb, quickly withdraw the forefinger you used to press down with, and lift up with your forefinger and thumb. Make sure you take the forefinger out just a millisecond after you pull the eyelid up, otherwise it will not be flipped. This, too, may take a couple of attempts to get the timing right., Follow the same steps you used for your other eyelid. If you're not ambidextrous, this may feel very awkward, but after a few tries you should begin to get the hang of it.
 After you are satisfied with your friends' freaked-out reactions, you'll probably want your eyelids back in normal, functioning order. Simply look up really hard with your eyes or blink really hard with your eyelids to return your eyelids to normal.

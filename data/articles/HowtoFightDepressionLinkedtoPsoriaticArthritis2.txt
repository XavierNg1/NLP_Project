Omega-3 fatty acids may be able to help relieve psoriatic arthritis by reducing inflammation. Fish oil is a good source of this nutrient.
 Cigarettes can make your psoriasis worse, and they may reduce the effectiveness of medications and other treatments. Similarly, alcohol can trigger flares and interfere with medications. Avoid smoking and ask your doctor if it’s safe for you to consume alcohol in moderation., Exercise reduces inflammation, keeps your joints healthy, and fights depression.

Avoid caffeine and alcohol after 6 p.m., stop using electronics an hour before bed, and make time to relax in the evenings.

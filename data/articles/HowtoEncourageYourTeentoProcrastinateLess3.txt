 If your teen is a perfectionist and uses procrastination as a way to come up with perfect ideas, or just won’t start a project until they’ve created it perfectly in their mind, they may have symptoms of anxiety. Some signs of anxiety include perfectionism, fear of making mistakes, constantly worrying, intrusive thoughts of worry, inability to relax, “what if” fears, and self-criticism.If you think your teen may have problems with anxiety, talk to a school counselor or therapist in your community to help them cope with these symptoms.
 If your child just can’t seem to sit still or pay attention, this can be a problem greater than simple distraction. Your child may want to accomplish projects but lack the skills to stay on task or maintain their attention on one item. If your child struggles with learning and puts things off due to them being extremely difficult, this might indicate a learning disorder. Both attention and learning problems can be addressed by a psychologist, who can then offer recommendations and accommodations for school and home.Set an appointment with the school psychologist or see a psychologist at a local mental health clinic.
 A teen that thinks negatively about their work or its outcome may be prone to negative thoughts that lead to procrastination. If you hear your teen talking negatively about their abilities or performance, challenge them to see themselves or their work more positively. Build hope and confidence in their abilities.For example, if they say, “I can’t start my paper because I don’t have any good ideas,” challenge this. Say, “You’ve written lots of interesting papers in the past and I’m sure you can write this one, too. What are some different ways of looking at your topic?”

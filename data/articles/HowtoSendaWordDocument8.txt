 If you’re using Word 2016 for Windows or Mac, you’ll be able to use the built-in “Share” feature to send your document from the app.


If you’re using an older version of Word, just click the File menu (or Office button in 2007) and select “Send” or “Send To” to send a Document.
 To avoid sending an outdated version of your document, click “File” and then “Save”.
 You’ll see this icon in the top right corner of Word. It looks like the silhouette of a person with a + sign., If you haven’t saved the document to the cloud, you’ll be prompted to do so. Word attempts to save your document to the cloud in case you want to share the document for editing instead of sending it as an attachment (more on this soon).
 “Send as Attachment” will allow you to email a copy of the document to a recipient.


If, instead of sending the file to the recipient, you’d like to be able to share online editing access of the document, choose “Invite People” instead.Type the person’s email address when prompted, then click “Send” to email them an invitation to edit the document.
 You have two options from which to choose:Send a copy: Choose this option if the person to whom you’re sending the document needs to edit or add to the document.
Send a PDF: Choose this option if you don’t want the document to be modified.
 Once you select an attachment option, a new email message will open in your default email program (e.g., Outlook, Apple Mail). Enter the recipient’s email address into the “To:” field, type a subject line, and a description of the file in the body.


To send the document to multiple people, separate each email addresses with a comma (,).

 Canvas drop cloths work best, but they can be more expensive; if you need to use something else, tape down some rosin paper instead.Don safety goggles and a face mask. A face mask will help to filter out some of the paint fumes, while safety goggles will prevent dust and other residue from getting into your eyes during the sanding process.;
, Grab a putty knife or a trowel and hit any uneven surfaces with joint compound, smoothing it out with a putty knife. You may need to apply two coats of compound, as it shrinks when it dries, so it's better to apply thick and sand down later than not applying enough.
 Use a fine-grit sander to go over all the wall surfaces. The best implement to use is a random orbital sander, although you can use sandpaper and a little bit of elbow grease if you're in a pinch. Reach hard-to-get-to areas with a pole extension or a ladder.


Don't skimp on the sanding. Proper sanding will help do several things:
It will help to remove any protective coating on the paneling that could interfere with the adherence of the paint.
It will increase adhesion of the paint to the surface.
It will increase the smoothness of the final surface.
 Dust or residue is the enemy of primer and paint; any residue left over will mar the final look of your paint in addition to making the surface rougher.


Clean with TSP (tri-sodium phosphate) or a TSP substitute. Rinse the TSP off with a clean cloth and allow a few hours for the walls to dry.
 This will make it easier to create a smooth surface for the painting. Smooth the compound with the trowel and allow it to dry. If necessary, use the sander to smooth the joints until they are level with the surrounding panels. Wipe with a dry cloth to remove any residue left by the sanding.

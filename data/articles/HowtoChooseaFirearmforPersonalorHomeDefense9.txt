 Rifles are designed to fire a single projectile, often smaller than most pistol bullets, at a much higher rate of speed.
 Carbines are usually lighter in weight, and are shorter barreled (and stocked) than full blown rifles. They often fire the same cartridges, however due to their length they are often chambered in smaller, less powerful calibers.







Rifle cartridges are far more powerful than handgun cartridges. This greater power means you can shoot effectively at a much longer distance.






Rifles still require a good deal of precision, but the dexterity needed for a pistol is not necessary, and stopping power is much improved.
 Home defense situations may require you to place the stock below your shoulder, reducing your accuracy. Movement around corners and through doors may be hampered by your barrel preceding you through the door, warning an enemy that you're there.






Rifles are also more capable of "over penetration". This is where the bullet passes through an object, such as a wall, or your intended target and continue on with enough force to injure or kill. Over penetration can be mitigated through proper ammunition choice, but is always a serious consideration with rifles.






Rifle ammunition is much more expensive than handgun ammunition. This can mean that it is more expensive to practice with your rifle, and reduce the amount of training and practice you can afford.






The overall length of rifles also means that they are slower to aim than a handgun due to their weight. Compared to a pistol, swinging a rifle around to engage a threat can take longer, and in a self defense situation, lost time can be deadly.

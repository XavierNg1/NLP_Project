 Just utilize your palm to wipe your nose immediately after you cover your mouth.
 You can do so by integrating the act of "covering your mouth" into the way in which you bring your hand into position to perform the sideways allergic salute.
 As you bring your hand up to rub your forehead you can sneak a sideways allergic salute on the way. If you are only wiping your brow you can also wipe your nose on your palm as your fingers rub your forehead.
 Consider integrating nose wiping techniques into any motion where you need to adjust your glasses.


To wipe one nostril during an act to reposition glasses, use the index finger and thumb that corresponds to the running nostril to make the letter "c" or backwards "×›". While your hand is on its way to adjust the frame of your glasses, sneak a wipe with the back and interior side of your thumb.
Make others think you are pushing a sliding frame of glasses back up the bridge of your nose with the tips of your fingers as you simultaneously perform the allergic salute by wiping your nose on your palm. The act of wiping the nose itself may move glasses out of position so this technique solves both problems.
 This can easily be achieved by causing a distraction (such as asking a question that will cause others to turn from you to look at something) which can give you adequate time to wipe your running nose.

 You can make your own nail art stars to apply to your nails if you donâ€™t fancy freehand nail art. To do this, you will need:Nail polish in the color(s) of your choice
Waxed paper
Decorative star hole punch
Clear topcoat

, Begin by painting all of your nails in the color(s) of your choice. Do a couple of coats to ensure an even finish and allow the nail polish to dry completely.Be sure to consider the color(s) you plan to use for the stars. It is best to choose a contrasting color so that the stars will be visible. For example, you could do black nails with white stars, red nails with light blue stars, or purple nails with yellow stars.
 You will need to create a thick layer of nail polish to ensure that the star shapes will hold up when you peel them away from the paper. Do three coats and allow the paint to completely dry after each coat.To ensure that the nail polish is completely dry, you might want to let it sit overnight, or at least for a few hours.
 Once the paint has dried, use the decorative hole punch to punch out some stars. Punch out as many as you want to apply to your nails.Before you apply the stars to your nails, you will need to peel them away from the waxed paper. Do this carefully to avoid ripping the nail polish shape. If the stars seem flimsy, then you might need to use more nail polish layers next time.
 To apply the stars, paint over your nails with a layer of clear topcoat. Then, gently press the star onto your nail where you want it to go. After you finish applying all of the stars, paint over your nails with another layer of clear topcoat and let them dry completely.

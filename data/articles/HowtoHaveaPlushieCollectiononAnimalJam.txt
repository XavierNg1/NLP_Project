 The castle den has the perfect space for all plushies, including the lynx, otter, hyena, polar bear, llama, and owl plushies. This way, you won't have too little or too much space.;
, Make sure your plushies are arranged by animal, then in this order by color: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, black, and brown. Make sure you leave spaces for the ones you're missing!





, In order to have room for your plushies, you need to recycle all other den items (and doubles of plushies), and if they're rare you can keep them on a storage. This way, you'll have the space for all your plushies.
 Don't forget to add all the new plushies you get to your den, and never recycle plushies you don't have yet!

, In order to be able to get phantom plushies, you need to find a jammer with this kind of the claw. Stickyslug and Mcarloaj are some of the jammers that have the rare claw.
 In order to have the best chance of getting plushies, move the claw under the first phantom, then like the red button. Keep going to each phantom until after the last one, then exit out of the claw and repeat.
 If you don't get plushies for a while, leave and come back later! Sometimes you just get bad luck and need to let the plushies re-jumble.
 Google Docs or Microsoft Word are suggested for this step, which is to make a document for your list of plushies! Name it something simple like "Plushie List."

, In order to have a full list of plushies, go onto the Animal Jam Wiki and find the plushies. Then look at each page of plushies and put them on the document.
 This way, you know the ones you still have to do. Make sure you don't accidentally delete one you already have.

 Vinegar can help descale an electric kettle and remove build up from hard water. Mix a solution of water and white vinegar in equal parts. Fill the kettle around halfway or three quarters the way full with this solution., To clean the inside of the kettle and remove limestone stains, turn on the kettle with the solution inside. Bring it to a boil.If the scaling inside the kettle is really bad, increase the amount of vinegar in the mixture. Boil again.
 When the kettle has come to a boil, turn off the kettle and unplug it. Let the solution soak inside the kettle for around 20 minutes. After the 20 minutes, pour out the solution.If the scaling is really bad, leave the solution in the kettle longer.
 If the scaling is really bad, use a non-metallic sponge or cloth to scrub the inside of the kettle. Do this after you have let the vinegar solution soak in the kettle for a long time.Make sure that you do not scrub the heating element on the bottom of the kettle.
 Rinse the electric kettle with water. You may have to rinse multiple times to remove the vinegar smell. Wipe down the inside with a cloth. Let it dry.If there is any vinegar taste or smell left in the kettle, boil water in it again and dump it. This should get rid of it. Boil water multiple times if the vinegar smell or taste wonâ€™t go away.

 Fortunately, it is possible to use matte eyeshadow to turn some clear nail polish into matte nail polish. If you just want a matte topcoat, then you can use cornstarch instead. Here's a list of what you will need:


Clear nail polish
Matte eyeshadow
Cornstarch (optional)
Toothpick
Small cup or dish

, You can use whatever color you want, but it has to be matte. You can also use some cosmetic pigment powder instead. This will already come in powder form, so you won't have to crush the eyeshadow into a powder later one.If you want to make a clear, matte topcoat, then use cornstarch instead., You can use a paper or plastic cup, a small dish, or even a cupcake or muffin liner. Your nails will be whatever color of eyeshadow you used. Plan on using a little more eyeshadow than nail polish., If there are any clumps, break them us using the end of a brush or pencil. Keep crushing the eyeshadow until it is fine and powdery. If you have any clumps in your eyeshadow, your manicure will look grainy.
, Keep stirring until you get an even color and consistency. If the color too sheer, add some more eyeshadow. Make sure that there are no clumps in the polish. If there are any clumps, break them up with the toothpick. If you don't do this, they will show up on your manicure and make it look lumpy.
 The polish will dry fast. Simply apply a basecoat, then paint your nails as you normally would. If there is extra matte polish afterward, you can pour it into an empty nail polish bottle or another small, glass bottle.
 You won't see the true effect of the eyeshadow until the polish dries. Also, avoid using a topcoat; most topcoats are glossy and will reverse the matte effect. If you can find a matte topcoat, then that is fine.

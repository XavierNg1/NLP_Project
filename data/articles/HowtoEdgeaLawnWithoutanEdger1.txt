 It’s possible to adapt a lawnmower so that it trims the lawn edges. To do this, you’ll need to alter the angle of the blades by loosening the fastenings holding the blades in place. You want to alter the position of the blade so it is about half an inch above the ground on one side.


Once you’ve adjusted the blade, mow the lawn with the lower blade area hitting the edge of the lawn. Try not to cut through the soil when you do this as you will damage the blade. Once you’ve finished, restore the blade to its original position.
Be very careful when working with the cutting parts of the machinery and make sure the power is completely off before you begin. Be warned this method won’t work for all models of lawnmower.;
, You can just use kitchen or garden scissors to trim the grass at the edges of your bed. However, you probably only want to do this if you have a small lawn and don’t mind kneeling.


Get down on your knees – a padded kneeler may help – and cut the fringe of grass where it meets the edge of you lawn.
 If you have a pair of long-handled garden shears, you may find these very useful for edging your lawn.


Make sure the garden shears are sharp, as this makes them safer and more effective. You may like to sharpen them before you begin.
This edging method works especially well if you have problems kneeling or bending.
 You can also try using your string trimmer to cut the grass at the edge of your lawn – you’ll just need a bit of manual co-ordination.


Stand on the lawn edge and start the trimmer. Turn it 90 degrees to the ground. The trimmer will trim along the edges of the lawn, removing the grass blades and trimming the roots – this will prevent the grass from growing in this area and help to maintain a neat edge to your lawn.
Make sure you use the usual protection when using the strimmer: sometimes small rocks and twigs will fly up, so make sure you are wearing eye protection.

 Coat an 8-inch (20-cm) baking pan with a layer of butter, oil, or cooking spray. This will prevent the fudge from sticking to the pan, and make it easier to remove once the fudge has set.Alternatively, you can also line the dish with parchment paper instead.;
, Combine the three ingredients in a large microwave-safe bowl. Add a pinch of salt. Transfer the mixture to the microwave and heat it on high for 10 minutes.

 Stir the fudge one last time and transfer it to the greased baking pan. Use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides and get all the fudge from the bowl. Use the spatula to spread the fudge evenly around the bowl., Set the fudge aside and let it cool and set for at least an hour. This will give the ingredients time to cool and firm up. Donâ€™t chill the fudge in the refrigerator to set, as this can cause the sugar to crystallize., After an hour, cut the fudge into 1- to 2-inch (2.5- to 5-cm) squares and serve. Transfer any leftover squares to an airtight container. Store at room temperature for up to three weeks.

 Make sure you cut along the same direction as the fibers. The width and length of the strip you cut will determine how big your end result will be. One and half to three inches, or 3.81 to 7.62 centimeters, is good for the width. Choose between 15 to 30 inches, or 3.81 to 7.62 decimeters, for the length.
 Secure one end of your flower by placing a strip of glue down the length of one end along the edge. Fold the edge over one time and lightly press down to set it in place.
 Find one string on the opposite end of the strip between the middle and bottom part of the width. Pull the string away from the rest of the strip. You should end up with a strip of bunched, gathered burlap.
 Take each end of the bunched strip of burlap and circle them around to connect them. Glue the ends together with a dollop of hot glue.
 You will likely have lots of frayed ends after you bunch and glue your burlap together. Even though youâ€™re going for the frayed look on this one, trim any ends that look especially out of place.
 To add a decorative touch and make your flower look finished, add a rhinestone or button to the middle. You can also use another piece of fabric or anything you can think of to make your flower daisy-like.

 Keep your hat stored in a cool place to keep it in good shape. Heat can cause the sweatband to shrink, rendering the hat unwearable. The foyer, for example, may be an excellent spot if the heating is moderate in that area., Purchase a water-repellent felt hat protection spray to safeguard your hat. These sprays protect against rain and stains. Using these sprays extends the shelf-life of your hat., When putting on and removing your hat, avoid touching the top (the crown). The oils on your fingers or hands could transfer to the felt and leave a stain. Instead, handle your hat gently by the brim.

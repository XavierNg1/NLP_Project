 Instead of trying to shrink your pores, you could just try to cover them up using concealer, foundation and powder. This is an effective temporary solution which can help you to feel more confident about the appearance of your skin.


Choose a concealer and foundation than perfectly matches your skin tone, as this will help the make-up to appear more natural. Go for mattifying make-up if your skin tends to be oily and moisturizing make-up if your skin tends to be dry.
Apply the make-up lightly and evenly using a sponge or brush. Don't cake it on, as this will simply draw more attention to the areas you are trying to conceal. Make sure to wash your brush or sponge frequently, to avoid a build-up of bacteria.
Make sure to thoroughly remove make-up at night. Leaving it on will clog your pores, causing them to look worse.
 Applying a primer under your make-up is a great way to make your skin appear flawless.


A good primer (preferably a silicone-based one) will temporarily fill in your pores, without clogging them.
This provides an even surface for your make-up, making your pores almost invisible.

 It’s frustrating enough to get junk mail, such as credit card offers and charity donation requests, everyday, but having to open them to send them back just makes the process more tedious. Instead, leave the mail alone, so it remains just as you received it., When a piece of a mail is marked in such a way, the post office will send the item back to its original source. If the company that’s sending you the junk mail receives the correspondence back, it will hopefully get message that you don’t wish to receive any more mail in the future. Make sure to write in clear, legible print, so the message is easy to read.When you’re marking the envelope, it’s a good idea to use a felt tip marker that won’t smear if it gets wet.
If your handwriting is difficult to read, you may want to use block letters to ensure that the “Return to Sender” message is clear.
 Once you write “Return to Sender” on your junk mail, there’s no need to add postage. Simply place it in the mail as you would with any other item that you wish to send through the postal service.You can place the junk mail that you wish to return in a mailbox, but it’s usually better to hand it to your mail carrier or take it directly to the post office. That’s because if it goes through the automated system without a worker doesn’t specifically seeing the “Return to Sender” message on the mail, it may wind up back in your mail a few days later.

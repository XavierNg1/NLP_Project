 Open iPhoto from your Finder and then select the photo you want to shrink. If the photos are not yet saved in iPhoto, go to "Import" under "File." From here you can select the file or folder that you wish to shrink. Once they have been successfully imported, they will display in the right-hand window of iPhoto.;
, Under "File" select "Export." While it may feel strange to export the files you just imported, this is the easiest way to resize your photos.


A nice shortcut to export your photos is ⇧ Shift+⌘ Command E simultaneously.
 The window will be entitled "Export Photos" and it is from here that you will be able to compress them.
 You can select from the size options, but for most purposes, 40 to 60KB is convenient. To do this, select "Medium" under "Size." If you are really trying to save space, you may want to change the size to "Small," but this will greatly reduce the quality of the images so it is not recommended., Once you have resized and exported your photos, you can choose where you would like to save them. You can choose wherever you like, but for simplicity, it is best to save them to your desktop.
 You can now go back to iPhoto, select "Import" again, and then choose your photos from the desktop.

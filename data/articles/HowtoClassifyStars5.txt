 Not all stars are, but some are, and can be very useful.
 Eclipsing binaries, like Algol in Perseus, are two stars orbiting each other.
 Compare these to the characteristics of known variable types to determine the type of variable star. For example, Cepheid variables have periods of days to months and amplitudes of up to 2 magnitudes, whereas Delta ScutiÂ  variables have periods of less than 8 hours, and amplitudes of less than 0.9 magnitudes.

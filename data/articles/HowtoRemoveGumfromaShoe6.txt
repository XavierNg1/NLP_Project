 Soak an old cloth or piece of paper towel in some naphtha and rub it onto the gum. The gum should start to dissolve away.









Make sure to use the naphtha in a well-ventilated area, away from any heat sources, as naphtha is highly flammable.
 Acetone-based nail polish remover can also be used to dissolve chewing gum from the sole of a shoe. Soak a paper towel or cloth in the remover and rub it onto the gum until it disappears.









Just be careful what type of shoes you use this method for, as acetone may damage the finish on patent or suede shoes.

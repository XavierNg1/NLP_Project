 Toast to the level of toasting you prefer.
 Wash the blueberries if you haven't already done so, and dry before using.
 Spread the peanut butter across the toasted slices. Try to spread roughly in the shape of a head (rounded at the base of the toast, with two ear-ish circles at the top sides of the toast). Perfection isn't expected, just a general idea of a bear's head.
 This part makes the bear, so it's important to get it right:


Place two banana slices at the top corners of the toast. These make the ears.
Place one banana slice right in the middle. This forms the bear's snout.
Place two blueberries just above the middle banana slice, evenly set apart. These are the bear's eyes.
Place the last blueberry in the middle of the middle banana slice. This is the bear's nose.
 Eat whole. You don't want the bear to be cut in half.

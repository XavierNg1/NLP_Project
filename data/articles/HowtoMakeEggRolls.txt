 Allow your deep fryer to heat through thoroughly. If you want, you can use peanut oil, as it adds a pleasant nutty flavor to the egg rolls.

, Place your wraps on a clean surface so that the points are up and down and left and right (should appear as a diamond, not a square). Place the filling onto the rolls.
 Take the bottom point of your wrap and fold it over top of the filling. Fold the sides in towards the middle and roll the filling towards the top point of the wrapper.
 To prevent the egg roll from unwrapping in the deep fryer, you need to seal the seams; this also prevents oil from filling the inside of the egg roll. In a small dish or bowl, place a beaten egg. Dip your finger into the mixture and use this as glue to seal the top point of your wrap and any openings where you feel the wrap needs to be glued together.
 Since the fryer temperatures will vary and size of the egg rolls will affect the cooking time, there is no set cooking time. Place 3-4 egg rolls in the deep fryer and allow to cook until golden brown. Roll the egg rolls in the oil to evenly brown the wrapper. Avoid overcooking the egg rolls.
 Egg rolls are best served as soon as they have finished cooking. Serve with a chilled bottle of sweet cherry sauce, plum sauce, sweet and sour sauce, or anything you enjoy on egg rolls.

If you're skinning catfish, it's recommended that you wear a pair of gloves. Catfish have sharp spines that can cut you.
Again, only remove one fish at a time. Keep the remaining fish cold in the cooler while you work.
 Grasp the head to anchor yourself during this process.


Slice off the dorsal and ventral fins if you wish. If you're working with a particularly spiny catfish, the skinning process may be easier if you remove the fins. This isn't necessary if your catfish is less spiny.
 Take care not to break the spine with your knife; just make a shallow cut to help in the skinning process.
 Lay the fish on it's side and use the pliers to grasp the skin where you made a cut at the dorsal fin. Pull the skin toward the tail. Flip the fish and peel back the skin on the other side.


Use a knife to help loosen the skin if it's difficult to peel.
Remove remaining bits of skin with your fingers, if necessary.
 Use your hose, or the faucet provided by the marina. The pressure should be just strong enough to remove loose scales; avoid blasting the fish with water, as the meat inside is delicate.

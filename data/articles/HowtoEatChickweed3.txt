 If your recipe calls for fresh chickweed but you only have the dried variety, you can use one third the amount called for in the recipe. Since dried herbs are more concentrated, you donâ€™t need to use as much. Follow the same three to one rule as for other herbs., Put one tablespoon of dried chickweed in a cup. Add a cup of boiling water. Let it steep for ten minutes.Chickweed tea has been used to soothe the digestive system, as well as for constipation and rheumatism.You can also drink chickweed tea to relieve a dry cough., If you have frozen your chickweed in ice cube trays for use in the winter, you can use the frozen chickweed as you would the fresh variety. Keep in mind that you have more water content in the frozen chickweed. Add cubes of frozen chickweed to soups or smoothies.

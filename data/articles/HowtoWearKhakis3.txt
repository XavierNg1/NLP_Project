 Rolling your khakis is a trendy, casual look that can show off your cool summer shoes. To get a nice tight roll on your khakis, cuff the bottom once, pinch an inch of your roll and push it towards the center to tighten the cuff, then roll again. Aim for a roll that exposes the ankle but not too much higher.Women can use this roll to show off wedges.
 Polo and henley-style shirts are good casual options to make your khakis seem easy and effortless. Keep your shirts untucked for a more casual look.A striped tee is a polished but dressed down alternative to an athletic T-shirt.
A blouse or peplum top can be in keeping with khakis preppy style, while still feeling casual.
 Chambray and denim are good everyday fabrics that will keep your khakis from looking too formal. If you want to wear a button up, try a casual print such as gingham or plaid to keep your khakis dressed down.
 Socks with dress shoes instantly make you think office. To keep your khakis looking nice but casual, skip the socks for a carefree summer look. Leather flip-flops or boat shoes also make good sock-free options.Ballet flats can be a nice choice for women, too.

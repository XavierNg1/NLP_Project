 Although showing your child what to do is great, you'll want to communicate to your child what it means to be helpful and why it's important. Explain to them that helping others makes people feel good.


Brainstorm with your child ideas for how they can be helpful. This can be giving a gift to a grandparent, or offering to help a sibling or friend. Reinforce this behavior with compliments and tell them how proud you are that they are helping others. , When you explain to your child about the ways people help others, or share specific stories of such events in your community, your child can learn examples of how people care for one another. This can help them internalize what it means to be helpful and allows it to become part of their personality.


Find articles on the Internet or in your local newspaper about community events in which people help others, then read and share these stories with your child.
Watch television specials or news programs about people who have performed generous or charitable acts to help others.
 Children learn much of their behavior from watching adults. Rather than just telling your child about being helpful, you should act in a way that they can observe and learn helpful behaviors. When your child volunteers or does community activities, make sure to join them. Also, when you're around the house, use things you talk about or see on television as teaching moments.

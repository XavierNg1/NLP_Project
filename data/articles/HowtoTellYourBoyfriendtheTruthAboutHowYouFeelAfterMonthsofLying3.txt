 In order to practice honesty, you must have an understanding of why you lie in the first place. Do you lie to save face or act like you know something when you don’t? Do you lie to “protect” others’ feelings? Do you lie to avoid showing vulnerability? All of these are common reasons why people lie.Look to your past to spot themes in the reasons behind your lies.
 Once you get an understanding of the reasons you lie, establish a few realistic goals to stop your lying habit. Avoid making promises that you can’t keep, such as “I’ll never lie again.” Instead set the bar low and raise it as you develop a greater ability for honesty.For example, you could simply tell your boyfriend that when you get the urge to lie, you will share your feelings with him. That way, he can help you adopt the habit of honesty. Other goals you can set may include taking your time to answer questions so that you don’t resort to an impulsive, untrue answer., Being completely truthful after a long period of lies can be difficult, but it’s possible with practice. Take baby steps with your goals and try to be more direct and honest in small daily interactions. Replace your bad habit with a positive behavior like telling the truth.As you practice telling the truth, you will notice that the act becomes easier to do. You will also feel liberated from having to keep track with lies you have told people.
 If you feel you need extra help working on quitting lying, a therapist, self-help book or support group may offer valuable help. In addition, if you are having difficulty uncovering the reason behind your lying and believe it to be compulsive, you need to seek out professional help as soon as possible.Plus, it can also be helpful to have your boyfriend join in on a session to discuss rebuilding trust in your relationship.

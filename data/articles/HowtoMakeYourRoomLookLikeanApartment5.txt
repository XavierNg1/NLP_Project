 Make sure it is neatly made and has fresh bed clothes that match the colour scheme of your 'apartment'.
 If you have a built in wardrobe, you can keep using that, or, use that space as a different area of your apartment and add a free standing wardrobe.
 You can place on it your alarm clock and maybe a lamp for reading in bed. Also keep this aiming toward to color scheme. Add a small bookcase for some of your favorite books, alternatively, you could put your bookcase in your lounge area, next to the propped up mattress.

 Call the vet if you observe persistent coughing with or without other symptoms. The first step in making an accurate diagnosis is to report your cat’s symptoms to the vet.Tell the vet which symptoms you’ve observed and how long it’s been since you noticed them. Let the vet know if they came on suddenly or if they seem to be related to any potential allergens, like smoke, chemicals, or pollen.
 In addition to evaluating the cat’s symptoms and giving it an initial physical exam, the vet will need to screen your cat’s blood. They'll test for heartworm, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia, and other potential underlying conditions.Blood tests can also help evaluate the condition of the cat's organs.


These tests will help accurately diagnose acute or chronic bronchitis and help the vet better understand your cat’s overall health.
 The vet will most likely recommend some sort of imaging test, such as an x-ray or bronchoscopy. A bronchoscopy is a technique that uses a small camera to examine lung tissue. The vet may also take a culture or biopsy of respiratory tissue to make an accurate diagnosis.There are a number of potential causes, like infection or parasite infestation, that your vet will need to eliminate. Imaging techniques, bacterial culture, and biopsy are the most effective ways of determining the best treatment plan.

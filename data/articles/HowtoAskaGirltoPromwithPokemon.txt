 Cut out three pictures of her least favorite starter, and attach a piece of paper that reads, "Aw, it got away," to each.
 Once she picks one, grimace and say, "Better luck tomorrow."

 After she picks, smile and say, "I guess you get to find out tomorrow."

, In a single Pokeball, add a picture of her number 1 favorite starter, with the text reading, "Will you go to prom with me?"

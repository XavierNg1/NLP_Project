 Don't give your email out unless you trust the source. While some spam is unfortunately inevitable these days, you can minimize most of it by just keeping your email address private., For example, say that your Tumblr handle is WikiHow15. If your email address is wikihow15@gmail.com, you've basically given the whole world your address. Most spammers actually "test" thousands of guessed emails until they find those that work -- so having differentiated emails and usernames can help keep them at bay., This signs your address up for regular, robotically sent emails, notifications, and spam. Unless you really love the site or band, avoid this box at all costs.


Check to see if this box is pre-checked for you -- many sites make you opt-out of spam instead of in.
 One of the best ways to avoid spam is to concentrate it in one account. For example, you might set up an account just to buy things online, and another for personal business. You use the first email whenever you're purchasing or giving out bank information, then keep your personal emails in a more private account. You can give away one account at will, because you only really need it for specific functions.

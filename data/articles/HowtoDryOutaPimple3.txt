 An herbal facial mask can help clean, heal, and tighten your skin as well as dry out pimples. The key is to use astringent herbs that also have antibacterial qualities. For the base of your mask, mix together:


1 tablespoon of honey, which has antibacterial, astringent, and healing qualities
1 egg white, which acts as a thickener for the mask
1 teaspoon of lemon juice, which provides a slight whitening agent as well as acts as an astringent
Â½ teaspoon of an astringent herbal essential oil that also has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, such as peppermint, spearmint, lavender, calendula, or thyme, Once you have all these ingredients mixed, dip your fingers into the mixture and apply it all over your face. Leave it on for 15 minutes or until it dries. Rinse the mask off with warm water and a soft cloth.


You can treat your entire face or just treat individual pimples to dry them out. Use a Q-tip to spread the mixture over individual problem pimples.
 After you get the mask off, gently dry your face with a soft towel. Then, apply a non-comedogenic moisturizer. Popular brands of these moisturizers include Olay, Clinique, Neutrogena, and Cetaphil.


There are other good moisturizers, so you can try more. Just make sure they say non-comedogenic on the label.

 Combine all the ingredients in a large saucepan.


If you prefer a thinner butter, add a bit more apple juice. This recipe makes it very thick.
You can also add 1/2 teaspoon of allspice to the recipe, or substitute, increase, or decrease the spices to taste. Adding 1 tablespoon (14.8Â ml) of whiskey and 1/4 cup of maple syrup are other options.;
, Bring the ingredients to a boil over a medium heat. Reduce to a low heat and cover.


Some suggest letting it simmer uncovered.Pumpkin butter can splash everywhere, so you may want to cover and prop the lid open with a spoon to let the steam out.
You can also cook the pumpkin butter in a crock pot. Cook on low for 6 hours, or until thick., Let the mixture simmer for about 20-30 minutes, or until the mixture reaches your desired consistency. Stir often with a whisk, since it can stick to the bottom of the saucepan.
 After the mixture has cooled to room temperature, transfer the pumpkin butter to sterile jars, or even Tupperware. You can store it in the refrigerator for two to three weeks. You can freeze the butter for up to a year.


Do not can pumpkin butter. The USDA recommends against this.

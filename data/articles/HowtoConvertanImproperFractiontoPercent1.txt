 The numerator is the top number, and the denominator is the bottom number. It is best to use a calculator, because depending on the fraction, you might end up with a number that has many decimal places. Completing this calculation converts the fraction to a decimal.

Note that, because you have an improper fraction, the denominator will divide into the numerator at least 1 whole time. That means that your decimal will be greater than 1. It also means that your percent will be greater than 100%.

For example, if you are converting 138{\displaystyle {\frac {13}{8}}}, you would calculate 13รท8=1.625{\displaystyle 13\div 8=1.625}. 
;
, You can do this with a calculator, but an easy way to do this in your head is to simply move the decimal point two places to the right.For example, 1.625ร100=162.5{\displaystyle 1.625\times 100=162.5}.
 Until you add a percent sign, your number still reads like a decimal, even though it no longer is. So, add your percent sign to avoid confusion. The percent sign comes after the number.

For example, 162.5%{\displaystyle 162.5\%}.

 Have all of your workout clothes and equipment ready to go the night before so that you are not struggling to find your things the next morning. This will make it easier to get out of bed and head to your workout.


Pack your gym bag. If you go to the gym, pack your bag with everything you will need for your workout. It can be helpful to create a list of everything that you typically need and save it somewhere that is easy to reference.
Set out your equipment the night before if you workout at home. If your equipment is ready to go, you will save yourself from having to search for the things you need and wasting precious morning minutes. It will also make it that much easier to start working out before you can begin making excuses as to why you shouldn’t or don’t have time.
 It is important to remember to set your alarm so that you do not sleep through your workout window.


Clock radios are quite popular and commonly used. Some people prefer to wake up to the sound of the radio rather than a startling alarm. There are many options to choose from either online or in stores that have many features and show information other than the time, such as the temperature outside and the weather.Exercise trackers and smart watches often have silent alarms that vibrate to wake you up. This will help you wake up in the morning and not disturb your partner., Once you are awake, even if you are still laying in bed, it is important to motivate yourself to get up and follow through with your workout. Once you have finished working out, you will feel accomplished and more focused at work or school.

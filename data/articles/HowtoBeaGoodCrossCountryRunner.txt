 Make sure that you are hydrated, and also not full, but not starving. Running on an empty stomach can be distracting and the lack of nutrients makes your body unable to perform at its peak.;
, A warm-up is always necessary. This should not be very hard, but should be enough to get the blood flowing to your muscles so you’ll be able to stretch effectively.
 It is very important that you make sure your muscles are ready to run. Make sure to stretch your thighs, calves, and hips. A good stretch to do involves walking about ten feet on your tippy-toes and walking back on your heels. This strengthens your ankles so you have less a chance of turning your ankle over on a rock, root, etc.
 Do your workout. A good 1 to 2 or 3 miles (3.2 or 4.8 km) is good.
 Slowly jog 1⁄4–1 mile (0.4–1.6 km) to let your heart rate and breathing return to normal.
 Stretch any muscles that might be sore or that were used excessively during the workout.
 Although this step isn’t typically necessary, it is a good idea to ice any sore parts of your body, for example: hip, calf, knee, ankle, shin, etc. To prevent/relieve shin splints, many runners soak their calves in ice water for 12 minutes after running. The ice water cools off overheated muscles and relieves friction between the bone and muscles.
 Eat a healthy meal and get adequate rest after your workout.
 It's always good to keep a nice steady speed at the end you could sprint to pass someone.

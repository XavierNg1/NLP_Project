 Locate the Camera application on your device. It is an application with a camera as its icon. Tap on it to launch it.
 It will open your camera options. Locate “Panorama” at the bottom of the list, and tap it. You will be taken back to the camera screen, but this time, a panorama frame will also be displayed.
 In portrait mode (your iPhone is held vertically), the panorama frame will have an arrow on a line pointing to the right. Now, flip your iPhone to the left so that you’re holding it horizontally. This will change the display to landscape mode. Notice that the arrow in the panorama frame is now pointing up.


Using the panorama feature in landscape mode is useful if you want to capture something vertically, like a very tall tree or building.
 If you want to capture the view starting from high up and panning down, tap the arrow on the screen. It will then point down.
 Tap the camera icon at the right of the screen. Pan the camera towards the direction the arrow is pointing to capture the image in panoramic view. Make sure you follow the straight line on the screen to capture a seamless image.


When the image is captured, tap the “Done” button.

 One to two weeks before dyeing your hair, apply a protein based treatment. Do not wash your hair the day before or the day of your treatment. This will result in the removal of your natural hair oils. Your hair will be left dry and prone to damage.For hair that has minimal breakage, use a light protein based treatment. A reconstructive hair mask is a great option.
For hair with moderate breakage, apply a product that contains a lot of protein--look for keratin and amino acids on the ingredients list.
 There are five types of hair dyes to choose from. If you are looking for short-term color, try a color rinse or a temporary coloring product. Semi-permanent coloring products are a great chemical free option--the color will last longer than a color rinse or a temporary coloring product. Demi-permanent products have a small amount of peroxide, which sustains the color through 24 washes. Permanent hair dyes contain ammonia and peroxide. The strong chemicals allow the color to last for a long time!

, You may either have a professional color your hair at the salon or you may do it yourself at home. Either way, always follow the instructions!

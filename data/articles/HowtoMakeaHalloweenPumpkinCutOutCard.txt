 These are listed below. Then, cut and fold the colored cardstock to create a card shape.;
, Do this with a pencil lightly enough so that you can see it but can also easily erase it.
 Lay it flat, having the drawing you traced on facing outward.
 It does not matter if you slice through the shape itself, as the part that is to be been removed will not be used again.
 Close the card so that the parchment paper is sandwiched inside. Trace the outline of the card on the parchment paper with a pencil so that it makes a rectangle the same size as the front of the card.
 Glue the edges of the parchment paper rectangle to the back of the front flap of the card. Only glue the edges. This now becomes the highlighting background to your cut-out pumpkin image.
 Once dried, decorate the parchment paper to complete the pumpkin. One idea is shown in the image.


You may also wish to add extra decorations, such as a border, glitter, etc. or write a message on the front.

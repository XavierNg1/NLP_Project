To save the most money, you need to know what you already have and what you need.When you call your agent, say, "I'm traveling abroad, and I need to know if your policies cover me overseas? Are there any exceptions I should know about? What are the limits of coverage?"

, They probably will not cover all medical expenses accrued abroad, if they provide any at all. Itâ€™s best to know what they cover, so you know what travel health insurance you need. You can see if your provider has travel health insurance you can buy in addition to your regular coverage.Ask your agent, "Am I covered overseas? If so, is it only emergency care, or does it include regular care if I get a cold, say? What are the limits of coverage?"

, Credit cards vary widely in their travel insurance perks. Some only cover travel accident and luggage insurance, while others may provide some medical insurance while you travel. Be sure to go over all the limits, coverage, etc., before deciding to rely solely on your credit card travel insurance.Ask your credit card provider, "Is any travel insurance included with my card? If so, what does it cover? Are there any other travel perks I should know about?"

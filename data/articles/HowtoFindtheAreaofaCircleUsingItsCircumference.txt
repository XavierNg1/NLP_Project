 The formula is circumference=2π(r){\displaystyle {\text{circumference}}=2\pi (r)}, where r{\displaystyle r} equals the radius of the circle.Using this formula allows you to find the length of the radius, which can in turn be used to find the area of the circle.
 Make sure you substitute the value on the left side of the equation, not for the variable r{\displaystyle r}. If you don’t know the circumference, you cannot use this method.

For example, if you know the radius of a circle is 25 centimeter (9.8 in), your formula will look like this: 25=2π(r){\displaystyle 25=2\pi (r)}.
 This will cancel the coefficient of 2 on the right side of the equation, leaving you with π(r){\displaystyle \pi (r)}.

For example:25=2π(r){\displaystyle 25=2\pi (r)}252=2π(r)2{\displaystyle {\frac {25}{2}}={\frac {2\pi (r)}{2}}}12.5=π(r){\displaystyle 12.5=\pi (r)}


, This is the generally accepted rounded value of π{\displaystyle \pi }. You can also use the π{\displaystyle \pi } function on a scientific calculator for a more exact result. Dividing by π{\displaystyle \pi } isolates the radius, giving you its value.

For example:12.5=π(r){\displaystyle 12.5=\pi (r)}12.5π=π(r)π{\displaystyle {\frac {12.5}{\pi }}={\frac {\pi (r)}{\pi }}}3.98=r{\displaystyle 3.98=r}


, The formula is area=π(r2){\displaystyle {\text{area}}=\pi (r^{2})}, where r{\displaystyle r} equals the radius of the circle.Don’t confuse the formula for area with the formula for circumference, which you previously used to calculate the radius.
 Substitute the value you previously calculated and substitute it for the variable r{\displaystyle r}. Then, square the value. To square a value means to multiply it by itself. It’s easy to do this using the x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} button on a scientific calculator.

For example, if you found the radius to be 3.98, you would calculate:area=π(r2){\displaystyle {\text{area}}=\pi (r^{2})}area=π(3.982){\displaystyle {\text{area}}=\pi (3.98^{2})}area=π(15.8404){\displaystyle {\text{area}}=\pi (15.8404)}


, If you are not using a calculator, you can use the rounded value 3.14 for π{\displaystyle \pi }. The product will give you the area of the circle, in square units.

For example:area=π(15.8404){\displaystyle {\text{area}}=\pi (15.8404)}area=π(49.764){\displaystyle {\text{area}}=\pi (49.764)}So, the area of a circle with a circumference of 25 centimeter (9.8 in) is about 49.764 square centimeters.
 The formula is circumference=2π(A){\displaystyle {\text{circumference}}=2{\sqrt {\pi (A)}}}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the circle. This formula is derived by rearranging the value of r{\displaystyle r} in the formula for the area of a circle (area=π(r2){\displaystyle {\text{area}}=\pi (r^{2})}) and substituting that value into the circumference formula (circumference=2π(r){\displaystyle {\text{circumference}}=2\pi (r)})., This information should be given to you. Make sure you substitute the circumference on the left side of the formula, not for the value of A{\displaystyle A} on the right side.

For example, if you know the circumference is 25 centimeter (9.8 in), your formula will look like this: 25=2π(A){\displaystyle 25=2{\sqrt {\pi (A)}}}.
 Remember that what you do to one side of an equation, you must do to the other side as well. Dividing by 2 simplifies the right side to π(A){\displaystyle {\sqrt {\pi (A)}}}.

For example:25=2π(A){\displaystyle 25=2{\sqrt {\pi (A)}}}252=2π(A)2{\displaystyle {\frac {25}{2}}={\frac {2{\sqrt {\pi (A)}}}{2}}}12.5=π(A){\displaystyle 12.5={\sqrt {\pi (A)}}}


, When you square a value, you multiply the value by itself. Squaring a square root cancels the square root, leaving you with the value under the radical sign. Remember to keep the equation balanced by squaring both sides.

For example:12.5=π(A){\displaystyle 12.5={\sqrt {\pi (A)}}}12.52=(π(A))2{\displaystyle 12.5^{2}=({\sqrt {\pi (A)}})^{2}}156.25=π(A){\displaystyle 156.25=\pi (A)}


, If you have a scientific calculator, you can use the π{\displaystyle \pi } function instead to get a more accurate answer. This will cancel out π{\displaystyle \pi } on the right side of the equation, leaving you with the value of A{\displaystyle A}. This is the area of the circle, in square units.

For example:156.25=π(A){\displaystyle 156.25=\pi (A)}156.25π=π(A)π{\displaystyle {\frac {156.25}{\pi }}={\frac {\pi (A)}{\pi }}}49.7359=A{\displaystyle 49.7359=A}So, the area of a circle with a circumference of 25 centimeter (9.8 in) is about 49.74 square centimeters.

 When you're in class or at work, is she always in the front or back of your mind? Do you find yourself dreaming about her instead of doing your work? This is a very good sign.;
, Ask yourself some questions:


Do you get excited?
Does a smile come to your face?
Do you feel butterflies in your stomach?
Does your heart start to beat faster? If so, then this is another sign that you like her.
 In class, determine if you are trying to think of excuses to talk to her or reasons to text or call her. Do you go out of your way to 'casually' bump into her and start a conversation?

, Do you try to say something to her, but then stop or spend a long time trying to figure out what to post on her Facebook profile, or what kind of things you should say when you e-mail her? You want to impress her, and you don't want to creep her out or make her think that you're a loser, right? If you feel this way, you like her!

, When you see her with other guys, or when she mentions them, think about if you feel an intense surge of jealousy or do you feel so angry that you want to punch the other guy in the face. Or, do you feel sad or like she's let you down? If you're feeling any (or all) of these things, you probably like her. If you aren't feeling any of these things, it means that you like her, but as a friend.
 E.g. just like talking to her, to you go out of your way to be around her? Do you try to sit near her in class, or hang out with her at lunch? Also, when you're around her, do you feel excited? This is a very good sign.
 For example, you're really cool and relaxed when you're talking to a buddy, and then when you start talking to her, you get nervous. You might trip over your words, and your hands might start to sweat. Also, your conversations might be awkward. This usually happens if you like her. Even if you two have been friends for a while, it could still happen. That definitely means that you have special feelings for this girl.

 You might see the 8 are far more lifestyle based and involved as the 5 are "refrain" or "avoid" these are more a promise to totally abstain. Some have expanded particular aspects, some are different altogether. It is certainly possible to do these 8 during the day to day life, but more often this is left to temple visits or a time someone wants to dedicate a period to observing the 8 while using the 5 as a basis.


Some interpretations of No. 7 also include abstaining from wearing indulgent clothing, wearing labels and corporate logos (etc) in preference for simple or "plain" clothes. Some communities further observe this by wearing white and abstaining from bold patterns & brightly colored clothing.

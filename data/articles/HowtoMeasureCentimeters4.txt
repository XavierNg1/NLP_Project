 In 1 inch there are 2.54 centimeters.To convert inches to centimeters, multiply the number of inches by 2.54.

For example, to convert 9.41 inches to centimeters, you would calculate 9.41×2.54=23.9{\displaystyle 9.41\times 2.54=23.9}. Thus, 9.41 inches is the same length as 23.9 centimeters.
 In 1 foot there are 30.48 centimeters. So, to convert feet to centimeters, multiply the number of feet by 30.48.For example, to convert 7.2 feet to centimeters, you would calculate 7.2×30.48=219.46{\displaystyle 7.2\times 30.48=219.46}. So, 7.2 feet is equivalent to 219.46 centimeters.
 A yard is 3 feet. Since there are 30.48 centimeters in 1 foot, the amount of centimeters in a yard is triple that: 91.44. To convert yards to centimeters, multiply the number of yards by 91.44.

For example, to convert 3.51 yards to centimeters, you would calculate 3.51×91.44=320.96{\displaystyle 3.51\times 91.44=320.96}. So, 3.51 yards is the same length as 320.96 centimeters.

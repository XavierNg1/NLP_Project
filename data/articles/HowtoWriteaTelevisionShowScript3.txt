 Use a standard script template to help you with formatting. If you're writing for a contest, they should give you the proper regulations to follow in order to present your script, or your producer or director should tell you the specifics of your delivery. Anyway the form of the basic script template should be the same for all of them.
 There is nothing more valuable for getting better than experience, and the person who started writing the script is definitely different than the one who finished it. Read it again and correct what should be corrected.

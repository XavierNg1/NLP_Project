 Do you have a broadband connection? DSL? Dial-up? Each of these offers different speeds. A broadband connection usually has a 512 kilobytes/second speed or more (to give an idea of how fast that is, the average web page is about 70 kilobytes and an average song is about 3,000 kilobytes, or 3 megabytes).;
, There are several ways to do this:


Manually download a file from an email or from a trusted website. Watch the transfer speed and average the highest and lowest rates to find your average actual bandwidth.
Run an automated speed test using a site that pings (sends and receives packets of data) servers located in your country-preferably in your region. This is the easiest way to figure out your bandwidth as it is entirely automated. There is a variety of trusted websites that tell you how to calculate bandwidth, but one of the easiest is provided by CNET (the link is provided below). Simply click on your location and it does the rest for you.
 They will be able to provide all information you need about your Internet line, usage, download rates and potential caps.

 Certainly, there will be times when you are caught up in your own thoughts and feelings and unable to fully attend to your partner. Nonetheless, the majority of the time, you should try to tune in to what your partner may be feeling. Notice the nonverbal cues that tell you what’s going on with them, and help you devise an appropriate response.For example, you might notice when your partner gets a creaky tone of voice that they are deeply emotional. At this time, you might be clued in that they need your full attention. Shut off any distractions and practice active listening.
 You don’t have to reinvent the wheel each day. You can enhance your responsiveness and better attend to your partner’s feelings and needs by recalling similar encounters. If your partner told you last month that they want you to listen without trying to fix their problems, keep this in mind when a new problem arises., A big part of being a responsive partner is being compassionate. Your relationship satisfaction and emotional connection depends on you being a decent human being. In other words, you can’t be a responsive partner and not show warmth and concern for partner as a person.For example, you are watching a sports event or your favorite TV show and your partner comes in sighing heavily and slamming doors. Responsiveness would require for you to pause the TV and attend to your partner’s emotional experience.
Show compassion by asking what’s the matter, offering a hug, or suggesting something fun to help cheer your partner up.
 Another way to address your partner’s needs is through intimacy. It can be tempting to let go and only focus on your own needs during intimacy. But, tuning into your partner’s likes and dislikes, and responding appropriately can forge a deeper connection between you—both in and out of the bedroom.For example, if your partner seems to enjoy a caress down their back, you might ask, "Do you like that?" to see if they would like you to continue.

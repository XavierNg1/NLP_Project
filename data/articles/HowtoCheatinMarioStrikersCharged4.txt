 First, with a fast player (any speedy one will do) gain possession of the ball in your own territory. Hold down Z (the chip button) for a few seconds. Then run towards midfield, and as soon as you enter your opponent's half, release Z and move the player you were controlling either back into your own territory or horizontally off to the side. If done right, the chip will be very high and catch the goalie off guard and sail directly over him before plummeting into the goal.


This will only work in stadiums that have fast terrain. This works well in stadiums like "Classic: Bowser Stadium" and "The Wastelands". It will not work in slow places like "The Dump."

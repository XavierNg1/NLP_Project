 The factors are the numbers that multiply to create a number -- for example, 5 and 4 are two factors of the number 20. To break down an imperfect radical expression, write down all of the factors of that number (or as many as you can think of, if it's a large number) until you find one that is a perfect square.


For example, try listing all the factors of the number 45: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45. 9 is a factor of 45 that is also a perfect square (9=3^2). 9 x 5 = 45.
 9 is a perfect square because it is the product of 3 x 3. Take the 9 out of the radical sign and place a 3 in front of it, leaving 5 under the radical sign. If you "throw" the three back in under the radical sign, it will be multiplied by itself to create 9 again, which will multiply with 5 to create 45 again. 3 root 5 is just a simplified way of saying root 45.


That is, sqrt(45) = sqrt(9*5) = sqrt(9)*sqrt(5) = 3*sqrt(5).
 The square root of a to the second power would be |a|. You can further simplify this to just "a" only if the variable is known to be positive. The square root of a to the third power is broken down into the square root of a squared times a -- this is because you add exponents when you multiply variables, so that a squared times a is equal to a cubed.


Therefore, the perfect square in the expression a cubed is a squared.
 Now, take a squared and pull it out of the radical to make it a regular |a|. The simplified form of a cubed is just |a| root a.

 Any commercially available dish detergent should work; you can simply use the soap that you wash your dishes with. Pour a small amount into a large kitchen bowl, and then fill the bowl with warm water.Although hot water will not hurt the jewelry, it may burn your skin. Make sure that the water in the bowl is warm to the touch, but not painfully hot.;
, Once your warm, soapy water is prepared, fully immerse the jewelry in the soapy water. In order to let the dirt and oil on the Black Hills Gold soften up, let the jewelry soak for about 15 minutes. If the jewelry is especially soiled or dirty, let it soak for longer.Water and soap are harmless to Black Hills Gold; you won’t risk damaging the jewelry by letting it soak.
 Gently brush the surface of the jewelry to clean any grime, dirt, or oil off of its surface. Make sure that the jewelry is wet and soapy as you’re brushing it—otherwise it may not be completely cleaned. Brush both the inside and the outside surfaces of the jewelry, and focus on cleaning any areas that are visibly dirty.Make sure that the toothbrush you use is “Soft.” (You’ll be able to tell by reading the label on the toothbrush packaging.) A hard-bristled toothbrush may scratch or otherwise damage the surface of the Black Hills Gold.
 You can do this by running lukewarm water from your kitchen tap over the Black Hills Gold item. If you do not rinse the soap off of the jewelry but instead let it dry on, the soap will build up a slick film over the surface of the gold., Since jewelry that’s left out to dry may be dropped or otherwise damaged, it’s wisest to dry your jewelry immediately. Do so by gingerly patting the jewelry dry with a clean, soft piece of cotton cloth or a towel.Avoid using a cloth or towel with large holes or fabric loops in it, as these may snag on the jewelry and risk damaging the Black Hills Gold.

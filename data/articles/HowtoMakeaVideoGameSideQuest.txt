 Your side quest will have to be about something, so think what will be the side quest plot and objectives.


The Plot: Should be a small story with a conflict, as the player will be there as a key to solve it.
The Objectives: They have to be related to the plot and they can be really different according to it, for example, deliver a message to someone, give something to the X character, go to an X location, or between many other options.;
, The start of the side quest will be how the player will be introduced to that small plot. The most common way to do that is to make the player talk to an NPC, but it can be the opposite as the NPC can go and talk to the player when the player reaches a specific place. There are also a few other ways but they are very rare, like making the player find something that makes him curious and drives him to investigate about it.
 Now it's time for the objectives. As mentioned earlier in the first step, one objective can be totally different than another, and is up to you what they will be. Your side quest can have any number of objectives, since a simple one of donating some money to someone - and he only needs that - to one with multiple objectives, like finding out what some evil guy is about to and you would have to check his house first, then talk to him, or whatever.
 Last but not least, when the player completes his part on the story, the side quest should have an end and, depending on the side quest and the game, the player should be rewarded. Most of times, a great side quest ending is better than a reward, since the player should have fun completing the objectives and following the story already. But that doesn't mean that creative rewards like the Wabbajack in Skyrim are really welcome.

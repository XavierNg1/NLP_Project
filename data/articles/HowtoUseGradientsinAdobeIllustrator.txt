 This drawing will be used to experiment with the gradient tool. In this tutorial, we're using a sunflower. But you can use anything you'd like.;
, Use the pen tool to trace the image.
 This will help make things more handy when you start selecting colors.


For the colors on the sunflower, we'll be using these combinations. Orange: C=1.03, M=50.89, Y=73.31, K=0; Yellow Orange: C=2.85, M= 31.93, Y=91.5, K=0.07; Yellow: C=3.78, M=9.6, Y=92.18, K=0; Brown: C=35.61, M=79.07, Y=95.78, K=51.25; Reddish Brown: C=24.12, M=72.27, Y=92.81, K=17.58; Green: C=48.54, M=17.21, Y=100, K=2.86; Yellow Green: C=30.45, M=3.7, Y=98.22, K=0.02 Blue: C=49.75, M=0.43, Y=6.81, K=0 Light Blue: C=24.75, M=0.75, Y=0.22, K=0
You can also choose other colors according to your taste or preference.
 Select the petals of the sunflower and then click on your gradient fill or color fill box. The petals will have a black and white gradient. To change them, drag your yellow, yellow-orange and orange color swatches onto your gradient’s color stop. Note: You can also switch back and forth from linear to radial for a more realistic look for your illustration.
 Select the center of the sunflower and click again on your gradient fill. Change the colors by dragging the reddish brown and brown swatches onto your gradient’s color stop. Keep the gradient type to radial.
 Select the first half of the leaf and then click on the gradient fill. Drag the colors green and yellow-green onto the gradient’s color stop. This time, however, change the type of gradient to linear.


To change direction of the gradient so that the lighter green will be shown, just drag your mouse downward.
 No need to change the direction of the gradient this time.
 Apply by selecting the water drops and clicking the gradient fill on your gradient box. Change the colors on the color stop to blue and light blue and then change the direction of the gradient by dragging your mouse upward.
 Scale the drops by selecting them, right clicking over it, transform and scale. After scaling them to a smaller size, click on the gradient fill and switch the type to radial. Then change the appearance of the drops to soft light and to opacity of 80 percent.
 Then change the color of the strokes of the petals, lead, water drops and the center of the sunflower. Lastly, apply a blur effect on the water drop’s glisten.

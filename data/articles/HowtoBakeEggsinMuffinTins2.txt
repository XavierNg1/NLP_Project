 In order for the eggs to poach properly, the oven must be hot enough when you place them inside. Set your oven’s temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Make sure you know how your oven alerts you that it’s finished preheating. It may beep or flash an indicator light.
 Before you break the eggs into the muffin tin, you need to place some water in each cup for the eggs to poach in. Pour 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of water into each of the tin’s cups that you plan to place an egg in., After you’ve added the water to the muffin tin, break an egg into each cup of the muffin tin. You don’t necessarily have to fill all of the cups in the tin, so you can just poach one or two eggs if you prefer.While it means fewer dishes if you crack the eggs directly into the muffin tin, you may find it easier to break them into a small, shallow dish, such as a ramekin, and then carefully pour them into the tin.
 Once you’ve added the eggs to the muffin tin, place it in the preheated oven. Allow the eggs to bake for 11 to 15 minutes, or until the egg whites are set.If you prefer runny yolks, bake the eggs for 11 to 13 minutes.
If you like your yolks a little more cooked, bake the eggs for 14 to 15 minutes.
When you remove the muffin tin from the oven, you may see that some of the water has risen and is sitting on top of the eggs. Make sure that you know the difference between that and egg whites that haven’t fully set.

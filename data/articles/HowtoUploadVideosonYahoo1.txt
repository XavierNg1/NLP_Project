, Click the “Sign In” link on the top right corner of the homepage. The Yahoo sign in page will appear. Enter your Yahoo username and password, then click the “Sign in” button. Flickr is a Yahoo product, so you can use it as long as you have a Yahoo account.
 Click the Upload link on the top right corner, right before the search box. A black page will load. All the photos and videos from your computer that you drag here will be uploaded.
 Locate the video files on your computer. Select and drag them to the upload page then drop them there to upload them. The files will be displayed as they get uploaded. When each video file is uploaded, Flickr converts it before publishing it on the web. Once it gets published, you can now play it on Flickr.

 Start seedlings in organic containers that break down naturally, such as wood, clay, peat or paper. Organic containers can be planted directly in the garden, so the plant's roots aren't disturbed when transplanting.
 Grow seedlings in recycled containers like yogurt cups, egg cartons or milk cartons. Be sure to poke drainage holes in the bottom of recycled containers. Recycled containers can't be transplanted directly into the garden because they do not break down naturally.

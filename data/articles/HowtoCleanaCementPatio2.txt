 The longer that a grease or oil stain sits on the concrete the harder it will be to remove. Blot any stains that you see immediately with a paper towel so that it isn't as difficult to remove later on.Concrete is a porous material and absorbs oil and grease very easily.
 Put on a pair of gloves and dump 10 ounces (283.49 grams) of kitty litter into a bowl and add a couple of drops of acetone or nail polish remover to the bowl. Mix the solution together and then continue adding acetone until it starts to form a paste.If the paste is too dry, continue adding acetone to the bowl.
If your paste comes out too watery, add more kitty litter to the solution.
This combination of an absorbent material and a solvent is called a poultice.
You can use shredded paper towels, old newspapers, or sawdust as an alternative to kitty litter.
 Use your hands to spread the paste over the stains. Cover the paste with plastic wrap and allow the paste to oxidize for two hours. It should absorb some of the oil and grease stain., Once you've allowed the paste to sit and oxidize, you can remove it from the patio. Use a broom to get the initial paste up., Rinse the patio off with buckets of water or use a hose. Make sure that all of the kitty litter paste is removed from the surface of your patio before allowing it to dry.
 Allow your patio to dry from the sun for 24 hours. Alternatively, you can use a leaf blower to help dry off the concrete faster. Assess the results once you're done. If the stain has faded but is not completely gone, you can repeat the steps to continue reducing the appearance of the stain.

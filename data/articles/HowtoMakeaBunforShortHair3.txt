 Applying gel or mousse will give your hair a slightly wet, glossy appearance as well as helping it stay in place. Rub a dime-sized amount of gel or mousse between your palms and apply it from the roots to the tips, making sure it's evenly distributed.


If you prefer a matte appearance, you can skip this step.
 Use a comb to comb your hair back tightly to create a smooth appearance. Secure it in a ponytail either at the nape of your neck or slightly higher up, depending on where you want your bun to sit,

, Hold your ponytail straight and then fold it in half, cinching it so that it forms a small loop-shaped bun. Secure the bun with a second ponytail. The ends of the bun will be sticking out close to the nape of your neck.
 Spray the bun and the rest of your hair liberally so it won't fall out of place.

 Using Epsom salt or rock salt is an easy way to kill a stump cheaply. When you use the salt method it takes several months for the stump to die, so it might not be your best bet if you need to get rid of the stump quickly.


Do not use regular table salt, which is harmful to the soil surrounding the stump. Use 100 percent Epsom or rock salt with no added ingredients, to make sure the land around the stump doesn't get disturbed.
For a stubborn stump you can try a chemical stump remover or an herbicide containing glyphosate or triclopyr instead of salt.While a chemical herbicide will kill the stump faster, keep in mind that it could kill the roots of surrounding trees or shrubs as well.;
, Drill a pattern of holes across the surface of the stump, so the solution will be able to penetrate. The holes should be about 1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) wide and at least 8 inches (20.3 cm) deep, or 12 inches (30.5 cm) if you have a long enough drill bit. Penetrating deeply will ensure the salt solution saturates the roots below the trunk.








If you don't have a drill bit this long, use an ax to chop into the wood and make gouges as deep as you can.
If you're working with a stump that has large arial roots, drill holes in those as well.
 Fill up the holes 3/4 full with epsom salt or rock salt. Don't forget the holes you drilled in the arial roots. Now light a plain, unscented candle and drop wax into the holes to plug them.









It's important to make sure the salt stays in place, rather than scattering over your yard, since excess salt can be harmful to topsoil and the roots of other plants.
 Put a plastic tarp, trash bag or another nonporous item over the stump to cover it. It will die more quickly without sunlight and rain to continue nourishing any shoots that come up. After six weeks to several months the stump will die. Check it every once in a while to see how things are progressing. When the stump is dead, it should begin falling apart on its own.

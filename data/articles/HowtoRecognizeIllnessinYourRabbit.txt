 Do you have to regularly change the water bottle/bowl? Do you have to keep re-filling the dry food bowl? Do you keep having to add more hay or fresh food? Make sure that the hay is actually being eaten and not just being squashed at the back of the hutch. If you suspect that your rabbit has stopped eating, you must notify the vet immediately. It is a very serious problem for rabbits if they stop eating.;
, Your rabbit's abdomen/tummy should be soft and smooth. If it feels hard or firm, this could be a sign of a serious digestion problem. If you find hardness in this area, it's important to go to the vet immediately.
 Rabbits' noses should be clean and dry. It is okay if there is a little bit of discharge, but if the nose is running or bleeding it could be a sign that there is something stuck in the nose or that your rabbit is allergic to something.
 As with the nose, there should be no signs of discharge or running from the eyes. If there is, this could indicate a blockage, that something is in the eye or that the rabbit has an illness. Seeing the vet straight away is warranted.
 If your rabbit has its head tilted to the side and is scratching its ears, it could mean that it has some kind of ear infection. Rabbits do tilt their heads often anyway, but it's important to make sure your rabbit isn't doing it all the time.
 Rabbits have two types of stool; a wet, soft one that they eat and then hard, round ones that you find in the hutch and on the grass. If your rabbit is not eating the wet soft stool, it could be a sign that you have got the rabbit's diet wrong or that it is feeling too hot or is overweight. Make sure that the wet stool is not stuck to its tail area, as this could result in fly strike.
 Check up on your rabbit every hour or so and contact the vet if it gets worse. A change in character can be the first sign of a serious illness and if it is picked up early, it could prevent the illness or an untimely death.

 You can get a timer and test your speed on a variety of tasks. How long does it take you to catch a falling object? How long does it take you to make a decision given certain information? Or, more intangibly, how many balls do you drop or miss in a certain sport? Try to keep the variables as similar as possible in order to get the best results., If you are practicing for a sport, get the ball for that sport and play a game of catch, kick, or another sport-related drill. You could also get creative and use the ball for a different sport. Try to add additional partners, if needed, to make it more challenging. For example, if you are a baseball catcher, have your partner throw the ball behind you and then see how fast you can turn around and retrieve it.You could even try out juggling. As the balls fly through the air this forces you to act quickly in order to catch them. Practicing regularly can decrease your response time and increase your speed.You can also use a reaction ball. This is a small ball with six sides that will move in unpredictable ways when bounced or thrown., Place some cones at a distance apart and run between them as fast as you can. Switch up the position of the cones or run in a different way to mix things up. If you are playing a sport, ask your coach to suggest some specific agility drills that you can do., Your eyes can also lag behind the rest of your body when it comes to reaction speed. To get them up to speed, choose two similar objects and place one nearby and another at a distance. Rotate between the two, trying to read each of them. You can also ask your eye doctor for other exercises.You can also discuss eye agility training with a sports vision specialist. To find a doctor near you, go to the American Optometric Associationâ€™s website and do a doctor search.

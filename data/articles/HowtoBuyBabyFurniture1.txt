 Use a tape measurer or a laser measurer and measure the size of your nursery. Pay specific attention to wall space – as most of your furniture will go along the wall. Think about where you will place:


Your crib. A standard crib is about 4 to 5 feet long (1.2 to 1.5 m).
A changing table. Changing tables can be between 3 and 5 feet (.9 to 1.5 m) long.
A rocking chair. You’ll probably need 3 to 4 feet (.9 to 1.2 m) of wall space for a rocking chair.;
, Before purchasing baby furniture, you’ll want to decide on a theme and color scheme. This is important, as you’ll want all the furniture to fit together into your plan for the room.If you decide on a certain color, like white, pink, or baby blue, you’ll likely want to purchase all your furniture in that color. You may want to consider purchasing a set so everything matches.
 Although it may be tempting to start ordering baby furniture very early on during your pregnancy, you should wait until the second trimester to do so. By waiting, you’ll be able to confirm the sex of the baby and make sure that your pregnancy is normal and healthy. Ultimately, three months should be more than enough to put your nursery together., If you’re buying pieces of furniture individually, purchase the crib first. Since the crib is the centerpiece of the entire nursery, you’ll want to match everything to it. Ultimately, your crib style will help you decide on many other items you’ll need for the nursery.

 The color of a shot, in many cases, can define it. The sparkling blue of the Caribbean or the vibrant tones of a tropical locale would likely be lost in black and white. When the color scheme is part of the essence of a place, use color.Some cities are characterized by certain colors. Red, for example, is a lucky color in Chinese culture and is frequently used in cities. Without color, this aspect would be lost., Color photography really shines when there is striking light.Oftentimes the most stunning lighting can be found an hour before sunset or soon after sunrise. The warm, golden rays shed by the sun at these times of day will enrich color shots.Scenes that seem cold and impersonal might benefit from better lighting. Visit a photo location shortly after sunrise or before sunset to make the most of this lighting.
Storms or partly cloudy days can block or reveal the sun in interesting and evocative ways. You might want to keep your camera handy in these weather conditions.
 During dusk and early evening there will be a lot of natural color contrast between various light sources. The silver light of the moon and stars will interact with blue ambient lights and orange tungsten lights. These nuances will be lost in black and white.Shadows cast by ambient light can create interesting changes in natural color. For example, a shaded white uniform in the foreground of a shot might appear blue. The same white uniform under tungsten lights in the background would be warmer and have orange tones.
Capturing the differences or alternations in lighting temperature can create interesting “hot and cold” compositions. Generally, warm light has an orange or red quality to it. Cool light is comprised of blue and cyan tones.

, Be cautious about where the wild rose petals are harvested. Pesticides and herbicides are often sprayed on wild roses growing along roadsides or other public areas. Automobile exhaust will also contaminate wild roses growing along highways. Be sure to find wild roses in an area that is free of these chemicals.


Avoid blooms from plants that are infested with bugs or diseases. Be selective when choosing petals; a few bad petals can ruin an entire afternoon worth of work.

 Wild roses generally have five petals per bloom. When picking blooms, donâ€™t pick all the blooms from each plant. Leave some to be propagated for next year.

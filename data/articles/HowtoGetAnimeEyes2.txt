 Large "circle lenses" can achieve a more dramatic effect than makeup, especially if colored with an unnatural color. Always get your eyes measured by an optometrist first, and purchase the contacts from a reliable source. Poorly made or poorly fitting contacts can cause serious eye damage.


For an especially dramatic effect, try "sclera lenses," which cover almost the entire visible eye.
Always put on contacts before applying mascara.
 Dark or bold lipstick will make your lips appear fuller and larger, which will detract attention from your eyes. On many face types, over-accentuated lips and eyes together can be overwhelming or chaotic. Consider a light pink lipstick or clear gloss instead.


You can, however, make an exaggerated heart-shaped bow on top of your lips, if you are imitating an anime character with this feature.
 The innocent look of most female anime characters can be reinforced with a light pink blush on the cheekbones. For a uniquely anime look, cross the blush over the bridge of the nose from cheekbone to cheekbone.
 Brightly colored purple, blue, green, or other eyeliners can achieve an even less realistic look. You may wish to use this instead of black eyeliner if you are imitating cyberpunk anime, or other unusual styles.
 A thinner, higher arch looks more animated than a natural eyebrow, especially if drawn boldly. Optionally, you can also use unusual colors.


Wiping a gluestick over your natural eyebrows will flatten them out to make this more convincing.
 Keep two teaspoons in the refrigerator or a cold cellar for 20-30 minutes. Put the bowl of the spoons over your eyes until the spoons have warmed up. This pulls the skin around your eyes tight, temporarily making you look wide-eyed.

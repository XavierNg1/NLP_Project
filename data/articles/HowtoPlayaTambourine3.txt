 When music calls for sustained sound from the tambourine rather than for individual strokes, you can play a shake roll. This sound is generated by simply shaking the tambourine continuously to keep the zils jingling.
 To play a shake roll, rotate the wrist of your holding hand back and forth at a constant, continuous speed. This motion should always be generated from your wrist. Using your elbow or entire arm to shake the instrument can lead to poor tone and fatigue.
 Shake rolls are excellent for long, sustained rolls, especially when crescendos or diminuendos are called for. To vary your dynamic level, simply vary the speed and intensity of your wrist's motion. Shaking the tambourine harder and faster will produce a louder tone, and a softer motion will produce a quieter tone.

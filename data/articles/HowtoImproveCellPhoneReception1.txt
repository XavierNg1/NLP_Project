 To get more signal, you need to either get higher in elevation so as to be clear of obstructions or move around the obstructions that are present. Some deem this the "Lion King" method, where you hold up your phone in midair like Rafiki held up baby Simba. Beyond this, if you're at the bottom of the hill, start climbing. Reception may be better higher up.


Not all phones are made the same. Some are very good at using low phone signals and some are absolutely terrible. Ask other people what works best for your signal supplier.
Know where your local cell phone provider is so you can point your phone nearer to that area and eliminate the possibility of needless obstacles between the signal and your phone.;
, Don't bother trying to make calls from deep inside buildings or underground. Buildings and other large structures are very unfriendly to adequate cell phone signal. If you are having reception problems on the street, try walking to the nearest intersection, as there you may find better coverage.


Cellular band radio waves do not effectively penetrate earth: if you are underground you will likely receive no signal.
In addition, try downloading a signal map tool for your smartphone. These typically work by pointing the user in the direction of their nearest cell tower and can be extremely effective in locating better coverage.
 Today's cell phones are digital and thus more sensitive to a clear signal. Essentially think of the "best reception" in your line of sight. Even if you can't literally see the cell tower, what's the clearest path toward an open area?


Also remember that the signal can be reflected, so what reception you do get is not just subject to what is in the way, but also what it is bouncing off of Just because you are in a clear field doesn't mean you will get reception if you are in the shadow of a water tower.
Beyond that remember that not all cell towers serve all cell providers.

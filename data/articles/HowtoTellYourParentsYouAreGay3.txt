 Though you may be wanting to come out to your family ASAP, understand that there are certain circumstances that might bar that. If you are completely financially dependent on your family and you know that they are homophobic, it is likely unwise to come out at this time. Wait until you are completely financially disentangled from them to make such a decision., If you are still living at home, consider if you are at risk of being physically harmed if you disclose this to your parents. If so, it is likely best to come out at a later time when you have your own place., If you regularly heard your parents make disparaging or problematic comments about gay people when you are growing up, know that you will likely not receive a positive reaction when you come out to them. Though you can still come out to them, be mindful of how negative their reaction might be., Ask yourself the following question: If coming out goes bad, can I handle no longer having a relationship with my parents? If you donâ€™t think that you are emotionally independent enough from your parents at this time, consider waiting to tell them at a later time.

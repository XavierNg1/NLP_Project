 Mix ¼ tablespoon (3.7 ml) of baking soda with one or two drops of water to form a paste. Make sure the paste is not too watery, as this will decrease the paste’s cleaning power.The paste should be relatively dry, but not powdery. Look for a toothpaste-like consistency.
 Use a clean, cotton cloth to rub a pea-sized amount of paste onto your pieces of silver. Rub the silver in a straight back and forth motion until you see the shine return.As you clean your silver, it is normal for the baking soda paste to turn grey.
 Do this by diluting your paste with a couple more drops of water. Then dip your toothbrush into the diluted paste and scrub the smaller crevices.Alternatively, you can use a Q-tip to clean small crevices if you do not have a spare toothbrush.
 Do this once all the tarnish is removed. Dry the silver with a soft, cotton cloth like a dishtowel or with a Selvyt cloth. Finish by polishing the item with a microfiber cloth.

 Do not simply sticking a check in an envelope and mail it. This will come across as impersonal, and even lazy. Instead, enclose the check in a nice greeting card, and handwrite a personal message inside.


Address the card to both bride and groom, and congratulate them on their wedding. Include a personal statement, such as addressing a shared memory.
 That way, the couple does not have to wait for a joint bank account to get setup before one of them can deposit the check. For example, so that the check may be endorsed and cashed by either individual, do not make it payable to John AND Jane, but to John OR Jane.This will be especially helpful if the couple has not yet set up their joint bank accounts. The individual that you wrote the check to will be able to cash or deposit the money, without having to wait for a new bank account to be created.
If either member of the couple is changing their last name, address the check to the individual using their maiden name.Otherwise, they’ll have to wait for the legal name change to go through before they can cash the check, which could take months.
 If you’d like to opt for a fancier presentation, rather than enclosing the check in an envelope, you can gift-wrap it. Find a small box, put the check inside, and wrap the box in nice paper with a ribbon around it.


Envelopes containing greeting cards can be mislaid or accidentally thrown away. A box with some size and weight is much less likely to be lost.
Even if you gift-wrap the check, still include a note card with a personal message.

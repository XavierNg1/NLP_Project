 Before jumping into a new business endeavor, research current market trends, clothing production ins-and-outs, and success stories from other clothing line creators. Read fashion industry trade publications to stay updated on emerging trends and issues within the industry. If possible, reach out to a successful fashion entrepreneur and request their advice about your new project., Set a monetary goal before setting out to earn money for your startup costs. Watch every dollar going towards your goal by keeping a record book, Excel sheet, or whiteboard tally of your total earnings. Startup costs for an independent, self-run clothing line start at about $500 for initial inventory., Do various odd jobs to add to your startup cost earnings. Ride share driving, freelance writing, data entry, dog walking, tutoring, house cleaning, babysitting, and giving lessons are in demand tasks that you can be payed to do by neighbors, friends, or friends of friends. Post your skills and availability in classified ads, on sites like Craigslist, or on social media to be shared by friends and family., To avoid borrowing money from loved ones or close friends, use a peer-to-peer lending service to procure startup money for your clothing line. Peer to peer lending sites connect borrowers to potential investors more quickly and easily than a bank, and with less hassle. Opt to sign up with a large, well-established website which will present your proposal to a wider range of possible investors.

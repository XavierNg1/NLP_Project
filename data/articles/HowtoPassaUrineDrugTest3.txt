 Cranberry is a natural diuretic, meaning it will help your body flush itself of water and sodium, though not at the rate that Midol might. Although there is some doubt about cranberry's effectiveness for regular drug users, it really can't hurt if you use it responsibly and in combination with other methods.
 Many drug users report successfully passing an EMIT test after taking zinc sulfate. The zinc is reputed to bond to the metabolites and guide them in to the fecal tract instead of the urinary tract.


Take about 250 mg of zinc sulfate the night before your test. Avoid eating too many solids. Then, the morning of your test, take the same dose of zinc sulfates. Do not take any more than this if you choose to use zinc. Over-medicating with zinc can lead to harmful mineral deficiencies and should be avoided.
 Some people choose to use Niacin, or vitamin B3, in the hopes that it will help them pass their drug test. Niacin has not been proven effective at masking drugs in the urinalysis.Moreover, it's possible to experience very adverse side-effects with over-medication.If you do choose to use Niacin to try to cover up drugs in your system, be careful. It's probably safer to try to use another product or method.
 This is a last resort, but if you can't try any of the above methods, you can try to spike the urinalysis. Bleach, detergent, or blood is rumored to be capable of throwing off the results of the test in order to buy you more time.


If you have longer fingernails, try hiding a small amount of bleached laundry detergent crystals underneath them. Then, when it comes time to take the test, add the detergent crystals to the pee sample and be sure to mix well. This may buy you enough time to take the test again at some later date when you're more prepared.

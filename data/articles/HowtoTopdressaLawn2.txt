 The type of soil you have determines how to topdress a lawn, because you want to balance out your soil. For example, a heavy clay soil should have plenty of sand added to the topdress material to provide additional drainage.
 A basic mix is 3 parts sand with 3 parts loam and 1 part peat. Adjust this to allow for your soil type. Work the mixture until it is as lump free as possible.
 Otherwise you may just be planting more weeds in your yard.
 Donâ€™t use sea sand for topdressing.

 In a small bowl, mix together 1 to 2 tablespoons (14 to 28 g) of baking soda, the juice from half a lemon, and 1 teaspoon (7 g) of honey. Stir well to ensure that the ingredients are fully incorporated.You want a paste-like consistency for the mask. Start with 1 tablespoon (14 g) of the baking soda, and only add more if the mixture is runny.
Fresh lemon juice works best, but you can substitute jarred juice if you have it in your fridge. Add a teaspoon (5 ml) of the juice to the mixture.
 Once you’ve mixed the ingredients into a paste, carefully apply the mask to your face. Massage it into your skin using a circular motion, and let it sit on your face for 5 to 15 minutes.Make sure to start with clean skin when you apply the mask.
It’s normal for the mask to cause some tingling and tightening. However, if your skin feels like it’s burning, remove the mask immediately.
 After you’ve allowed the mask to sit on your skin for several minutes, dampen a clean washcloth with lukewarm water. Gently rub the cloth over your face to remove the mask completely.Use a circular motion with the cloth as you’re removing the mask.
 When you’re removed the mask with the washcloth, splash your face with cold water to rinse it a final time. Next, apply your favorite moisturizer to help rehydrate and soothe your skin.

 Set the oven temperature to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius), and let it fully heat. Next, spray a wire cooling rack with nonstick cooking spray and set it on a baking sheet.If you don’t have a cooling rack, line a baking sheet with foil and grease the surface with the cooking spray.
 For the fries, you’ll need 1 medium butternut squash that’s been peeled, seeded, and cut into ½-inch (13-mm) thick sticks. Place the sticks in a bowl and add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil, ½ teaspoon (½ g) of dried thyme, ½ teaspoon (½ g) of dried oregano, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Mix well so the fries are completely coated.You can other seasonings to the fries if you like. Garlic powder, dried basil, and crushed red pepper are some options to consider.
 When the fries are seasoned, transfer them to the cooling rack on the baking sheet. Place them in the preheated oven and allow them to cook until they are golden brown and crisp, which should take 25 to 30 minutes.Halfway through the baking, flip the fries over so they cook evenly on both sides.
 When the fries are finished baking, remove them from the oven. Place them on a platter, and sprinkle ¼ cup (25 g) of freshly grated Parmesan cheese over the fries. Next, garnish the fries with 2 tablespoon (6 g) of chopped fresh chives and serve.A garlic aioli or herbed mayo makes a good dipping sauce for the Parmesan butternut squash fries.

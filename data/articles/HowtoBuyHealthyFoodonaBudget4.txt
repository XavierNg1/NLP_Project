 This is a great way to save on food items that you know you will use. Try using the coupons on double coupon days for even better savings. Occasionally some stores offer even more savings, so it is important to familiarize yourself with the weekly deals and discount specials offered by your local grocery stores and supermarkets.
 Stock up on sale items that you know you will use if the price is right. Saving a few cents for an item that will likely sit on a pantry shelf for 12 months may be a waste of money, however, if there is a buy one get one free deal on a non-perishable item, it is best to take advantage of the offer, even if you wonâ€™t be using the food item immediately.
 Many generic brands are just as suitable as the larger, more well-known brands on the market. Some people even prefer the taste and quality of the less expensive brands to their competitors.

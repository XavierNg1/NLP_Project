A hammer grip is when the palm faces inward rather than up. You can use a hammer grip with dumbbells or even two-handed workouts such as chin-ups. By using a hammer grip, less weight rests on your palms, which forces you to grip more tightly., A good old-fashioned pair of hand grips with the metal tension coil at the top are an easy way to work forearm muscles while multitasking. Alternatively, you can squeeze a spare tennis ball or racquetball that you have around as well. Anything dealing with isolating and working your hand grip will work your forearm muscles.

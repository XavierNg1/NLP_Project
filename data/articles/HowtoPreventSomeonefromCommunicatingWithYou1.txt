 Most people find this disturbing and will leave you alone.;
, They will dislike this and will probably stop.
 This will put off the person communicating.
 They will feel a bit hurt and will not natter boringly so much.
 If the communicator is in the room and they see you laughing and listening with someone else them they will feel a little upset and will probably run off.
, This is the most direct way. You don't have to feel guilty. It's your right to choose who you talk to and who you don't. Just say "I appreciate your being friendly, but I have to be honest, I feel uncomfortable with our interactions. You might've noticed I'm trying to avoid them; I'd really like it if you tried to respect that. Thanks."

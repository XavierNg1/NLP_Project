, Use a sharp kitchen knife to cut each fruit in half horizontally. Arrange the halves on your prepared baking sheet.

Do not slice the tomatillos in half from top to bottom.
Keep the them in an even, single layer on your baking sheet. Do not overlap the halves or stack them in multiple layers, since doing so will prevent them from cooking evenly.
The halves should be cut-side down on your baking sheet.
 Place the baking sheet on the top rack of your oven and cook until the tomatillos become very tender.

The skins should begin to shrivel and may take on some light browning, but this method will not cause the skins to char or blacken.
 Remove the tomatillos from the oven and cool at room temperature until you can safely handle them with your hands. Eat or use as desired.

You can peel the tomatillos, if desired, but doing so is not necessary.

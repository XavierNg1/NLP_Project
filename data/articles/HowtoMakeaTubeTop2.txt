 Add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to each measurement. You will need this extra width for the seam allowances., Add 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) to your measurement.

 The top of the rectangle should equal your bust measurement. The bottom of the rectangle should equal your waist measurement. It will likely taper slightly.
 Secure the side edge with sewing pins. Leave the top and bottom edges alone for now. You will hem them later.

 Flatten the tube top on your ironing board, with the seam facing upward. Spread the seam allowances apart, so that they lay flat against the fabric to either side of the seam. Press them flat with a hot iron.

 Find that Â½ inch (1.27 centimeter) wide gap in the top hem. Push the safety pin into the gap, then use it to feed the elastic through the hem. When you reach the gap again, unclip the safety pin. When you are done, you should have both ends of the elastic sticking out from the gap.
 Use the smallest stitch you can, and be careful not to sew them to the fabric. When you are done, push the elastic back through the gap.


At this point, you can sew the gap shut for a neater finish.

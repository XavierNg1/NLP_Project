 Lymphoma can affect many organs, including the spleen, intestines, and liver.In ferrets, it is either called ‘juvenile onset’ (< 3 years of age) or ‘adult onset’ (> 3 year of age).Treatment options for lymphoma include surgery, chemotherapy, and medical therapy.Your vet will recommend which treatment option(s) will work best for your ferret.
 Surgical treatment can be effective for certain types of lymphoma (e.g. intestinal lymphoma), but not all. If your vet recommends chemotherapy after surgery, surgical removal of the tumor can increase the chances of successful chemotherapy treatment.When your vet diagnoses the lymphoma and identifies its location, they will tell you whether surgery is a feasible treatment option.
 Chemotherapy will not cure your ferret’s lymphoma, but can prolong your ferret’s life. The chemotherapy drugs have relatively mild side effects (e.g., weakness, vomiting, loss of whiskers). Some of the side effects can be serious, though, so your vet will want to monitor your ferret’s blood work during chemotherapy treatment.Your ferret could experience cancer remission (no signs of cancer) with chemotherapy. However, because the cancer will come back at some point, your vet may want to administer chemotherapy periodically during remission.In general, ferrets on chemotherapy do not become as sick as humans on chemotherapy., Oral prednisone helps ferrets with lymphoma feel a lot better. However, this feeling of good health usually does not last very long.If your vet recommends prednisone treatment for your ferret, be aware that it is only a temporary treatment that will not cure the lymphoma.
 Dietary supplements, such as antioxidants and supplements that stimulate the immune system, may help improve your ferret’s response to lymphoma treatment.Ask your vet for recommendations on which supplements would be good for your ferret.

 Almost all amusement parks have water fountains or will fill a cup of water for free at concession stands. Instead of forking over two or three dollars for a bottle of water, bring a refillable container to quench your thirst.To be on the safe side, check the park’s policies to make sure they allow outside beverages.
 Buying food at park concession stands will cost an arm and a leg if you’re feeding an entire family. Some parks allow guests to bring outside food, which you can either keep on hand or store in a locker.Even if you can’t bring food into the park, you can store food in a cooler in your car. Just make sure you can re-enter the park (preferably without waiting in line) after you head to the car for a lunch break.
 One of the easiest ways to cut your amusement park budget is to skip the souvenirs altogether. If you or your kids really need a knick-knack or tee shirt, try to find your desired items on eBay instead of purchasing them at full retail price at the park’s gift shop.If you do plan on buying souvenirs on-site, give your kids a firm souvenir budget before you enter the park.

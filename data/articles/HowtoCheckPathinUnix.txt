 When you type in a command, the shell searches itself for built-in commands, then it searches the directories listed in your PATH variable.


To check PATH, type "echo $PATH".






$ echo $PATH

/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin



;
, This shows the directories checked, separated by colons.

 While turned off, press and hold the A and B buttons on your DS. Continue holding both of these buttons and turn on your DS. Continue to hold A and B while your DS powers up.
 You will need to do this while continuing to hold down the A and B buttons. Wait until you see the Nintendo screen displayed, but before the Action Replay screen stating, "This product is not endorsed by Nintendo" before you press Start and Select.
 You may need to continue holding these buttons for a few seconds, but when you see the main screen for your Action Replay displayed, you can release the buttons you've been holding.
 Your product is now reset, and will likely accept codes once more. To make sure that all is well with your Replay, input codes as normal. If your codes work, you've fixed your Action Replay.

If this does not fix your action replay, it may be irreparable or you may need to try another solution to fix your problem.

 Verify that the leads you buy are fresh, and that they have not also been sold to other parties.


Search online for companies that sell mortgage leads to mortgage loan professionals.
Only purchase leads that are purportedly fresh and exclusive to you.
Ask about the company's guarantee and lead return policy, and buy only a few leads to begin with, in order to test them for quality.
When you call a lead, verify the timing and exclusivity of the lead with the potential customer in order to determine the company's lead quality.
 Orphan files are the mortgage lead files left behind by loan officers who are no longer working in your office. Taking the time to contact those potential customers could yield new clients for you.

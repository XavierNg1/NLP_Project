 Dish soap, warm running water, and a soft sponge are all you’ll need for regular cleanings. Basic, routine cleaning is the same for all copper sinks, whether your sink is vintage, hammered, raw, or polished.Use only a soft, non-abrasive sponge or cloth. Don’t use harsh scrubbers, such as steel wool.;
, Run warm water from the faucet and use the sprayer to wet the sink. Squirt one or two drops of the dish soap onto the wet sponge. Wipe down the sink with the soapy sponge from top to bottom on all sides.You should clean your sink daily to keep it in the best shape.
 Use the sprayer to rinse away soap suds with warm water. After thoroughly rinsing the sink, dry it with a clean towel.Drying the sink will prevent the formation of mineral deposits and green spotting.
 To remove a stubborn mark or stain, apply baking soda to a cloth and, with warm water running, gently scrub the affected area.If your sink is shiny and polished or finished, you can add vinegar to the baking soda to remove a stain. However, if your sink is vintage or you want to preserve a patina, avoid using vinegar.

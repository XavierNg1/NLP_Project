 The first basic thing you have to understand is the rumor which is going around about you. The thing with rumors is that they start off as one, and can keep getting extensions from here and there. So you first need to be aware of the exact rumor that was spread.;
, Analyse the fact," who are the people who could have spread this about me?" Once you are near sure of a rough set of people who could have been behind this malicious talk, do not talk to them. Ignore them. Confronting them without valid proof would only lead to more false accuses.
 Discuss with them about the rumor. Ask if they are also aware of it.
 When rumors spread, people expect you to act differently. And if you do act differently, people kind of start believing that yes, something going around about this person seems to be true, because she is behaving differently, after all.
 And address this large collection of people. You can probably start off by saying," I have become aware of the fact that certain things are going around. I have no concerns with these things whatsoever. I have not changed at all..." Ask your friends to be around you when you do this, and you can tell people," this is what i had wanted to say, rest is upon you, how you want to see things."

, After you have clarified yourself in front of people, leave it upon them. You know what you are, your friends and family know it. Be strong, and ignore things. When people will see you alright and happy as before, they will automatically be normal themselves. People usually forget all such things after a while. Relax.
 Go enjoy with your friends to take things off your mind.

 Snapchat should open directly to the camera interface.;
, This will bring up the Chat page; you'll find all of your recent conversations here in chronological order.
 This will open a chat window with that specific contact.There is no way to group chat on Snapchat.
 From here, you can also attach a picture, call or video call your recipient, or attach a Bitmoji if you have the service installed on your phone.


Your recipient will receive a notification that says "is typing..." when you begin typing, and another notification when you send your chat.
 This will send your chat. Your chat will show up on the "Chat" page as a blue arrow; when your recipient opens it, the blue arrow will become hollow.


Unless you or your recipient tap and hold the chat text to save it, Snapchat chats disappear entirely once both parties have read the chat.

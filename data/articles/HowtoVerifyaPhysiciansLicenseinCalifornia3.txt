 Log on to the Medical Board of California website (http://www.mbc.ca.gov). Click on "License Search," then "Physician and Surgeon," then "Search by name." After entering your doctor's name and running a search for it, their name should come up. Clicking their name opens the physician profile.


Read this page closely to see if your questions are answered.
Follow all links to disciplinary actions.
Disciplinary actions, if any exist, are located at the bottom of the profile as links that say something like "Found (1)."

, If you don’t see the answer to your questions, you can send an email to the Board through their email address. Make sure your email is in business email format, and that you include your own name and all the contact information for your doctor.Make sure all your questions are clearly and politely stated in the email.
The email address is: webmaster@mbc.ca.gov

, A more direct way to get answers to your questions about physician licenses is to call the Board and talk to a representative. The two phone numbers are 1-800-633-2322 (toll free) and (916) 263-2382. Be polite and clear with your questions, writing down the answers so that you don’t have to call again.The menu options for the Board are not related to physician license verification, so wait on the line until the operator comes on.
You might introduce yourself and explain that you are trying to verify a physician license.
Then you might ask, “Is there any way you could tell me why this doctor is still practicing when your website says his license was revoked?”

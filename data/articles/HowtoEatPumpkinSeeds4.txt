 If you toast or roast your pumpkin seeds to perfection, the outer shells don't really need to be removed in order to enjoy the seed inside, although some people like doing this.
 In order to do this:









Hold the pumpkin seed in your hand or pop into your mouth
Crack the side of pumpkin shell in half using your teeth, like you would a sunflower seed
Get at the inner seed and discard the outer shell

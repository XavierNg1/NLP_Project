 You can look in a phone book or online to find a lock smith in your area. You can also use websites designed to match you with a locksmith in your area.
 Locksmiths are often available at all hours without additional charge, and will quote you a price over the phone. Calling more than one locksmith can get you a better price. Be sure to ask the locksmith if they offer services for cars, as some may not.
 Once you have decided which company you would like to use, call them back and ask them to come service your vehicle.
 Regardless of what method you used to get the key out of the ignition lock, it is now broken. You will need to use a spare key or buy a replacement.

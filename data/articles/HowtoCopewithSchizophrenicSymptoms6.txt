 It's recommended that you avoid stress therefore and accept your fate of hearing voices at least some of the time, as we all experience some stress. Again, this does not mean you have to compromise with the voice's suggestions. Which attitude may generally render you trending towards being fiercely independent, like street schizophrenics have a reputation for being. It's far better to adopt an attitude of cooperation in life, both with well people and those who also suffer. Carefully evaluate suggestions for their mutual beneficiality therefore. Do what's good for the group, as is a lesson we socialized species learned a very long time ago! Be ready to sacrifice for the sake of the group's well-being. And where the opportunity arises for you to shine, step forth with courage, be not afraid, and give it your best shot -- then don't be alarmed if others come and improve on your best efforts. It's seldom you will be the absolute best at everything or even anything! Aha! Always more to learn, especially from other schizophrenics and schizo-affectives who are making their way too. You can be open to suggestions.

However, this comes with a warning: many "well" people tend to rationalize a lot and do wishful thinking an awful lot -- it's hard to tell that from a delusion at times, in this editor's humble opinion. lol ... Keep things in proper proportion and you'll be fine. What is the "proper" proportion in any given case or situation? That, my friend, is why some people just love math -- because it tends to answer that very question. And a+b = the ratio of a:b or a/b is possible in Neutral Operations. Read on: you're on the right track now. That is to say, the addition of two things, even two people, can be set equal to their relative proportion, which is somewhat amazing!

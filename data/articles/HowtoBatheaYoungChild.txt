 Fill the tub about a quarter full. They don't use that much water, and unless they are soiled with dirt and grime, they really don't need that much.Make sure the water is not too hot or cold. To match the child's preference, have the child stick his/her hand in some lukewarm water, and ask them if they want it warmer. Slowly adjust the water temp to the child's preference. If they can't talk, keep it a little warmer than lukewarm.;
, Have them sit with their backs against one side of the tub. You might want to put in a few rubber toys that they can't swallow into the tub for the child's enjoyment.
 If their hair needs to be washed, get that wet too. Grab a washcloth and a bar of soap, and lather up. Be sure to gently scrub them everywhere, and clean everything- not just what looks dirty.
 Leave in for about 1 minute, and be sure to rinse off completely.
 Get them out, help them get dressed, and comb out their hair.

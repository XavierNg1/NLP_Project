 You can use clear or white school glue. You can also use a decoupage type of glue, such as Mod Podge. If you plan on using this glue to cover a pair of shoes, use decoupage or Mod Podge. It will also act as a sealer and give you a more durable finish.
 Use 1 part glitter for every 2 parts glue.The best type of glitter to use would be the extra fine glitter used in scrapbooking. It will give you the nicest finish.


Consider adding in some tiny sequins or metallic confetti for extra texture. Don't use the paper kind of confetti.
 You can use a popsicle stick, a fork, or a spoon to stir.
 For less sparkle, add more glue. For more sparkle, add more glitter. If you are going to glitter something, like a picture frame or a pair of shoes, remember that you can always paint on more layers for extra sparkle.
 Brush it onto your project using a paintbrush. Try to get a brush with stiffer bristles. Natural bristles, such as camel hair, won't hold up to the glitter very well. When you are done using the glue, wash the paintbrush and close the jar tightly.


If you want your project to be super sparkly, wait until the glue dries before adding a second layer. Keep adding layers (and letting them dry in between) until you get the sparkly you desire.If you are using very light glitter, such as pale pink or white, consider painting your project with acrylic paint first. Use the same color of paint as your glitter. Let the paint dry before you add the glitter glue.The glitter may shed, especially if you painted a large area. Wait until the glue dries, then brush on a thin layer of decoupage or Mod Podge. This will seal the glitter in and keep it from shedding.

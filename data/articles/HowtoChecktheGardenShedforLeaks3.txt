 Repair any damage you can see to the external roof by replacing lost tiles or shingles. Avoid making any further holes in felt roof material by nailing down loose bits.
 You can purchase a bitumen mat material that works well as a ‘sticking plaster’ for any roof holes. This is available with a self-adhesive backing so it can simply be cut to fit and applied to the roof.


You can also apply a generous layer of bitumen paint before adding the patch of felt. Apply the felt while the paint is still wet.
Duct tape also works well as a robust temporary measure.
 If you spot any cracks in the shed, patch them immediately using wood filler (outside) and duct tape (inside). Any leaking windows can be patched using sealant., To preserve the life of your shed, it’s a good idea to repaint it every few years with timber preservative, stain or paint. This will help preserve the wood.

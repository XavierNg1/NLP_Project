 Set up a pair of whiteboards or chalkboards in your room: one for chores and one for school assignments. You can use these to stay on task, and you can also check them off when done, a whiteboard with everything crossed off and done can be very motivating!

, Know when things are due, and what chores need to be done when.
 For example, set aside Friday evenings to relax.

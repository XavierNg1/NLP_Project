 You can use the Powerwash tool to quickly wipe and reset the Chromebook.


If you can't sign into your Chromebook, press Ctrl+Alft+â‡§ Shift+R while on the Login screen to start the Powerwash process. You won't be able to backup any data unless you are able to login., Any data that is stored locally on the Chromebook will be deleted when you reset it. Save all of your important data to Google Drive before proceeding with the reset process.
 This will open the Chromebook Settings menu.
 Additional settings will be displayed.
 Click "Restart" to confirm.
 This is the last chance to back out of the reset process.
 After a few moments, you'll be taken to the Chromebook's Setup screen. You can setup the Chromebook as if it was new and enter in your Google account information.
 If you've picked up your Chromebook secondhand and are faced with the Enroll screen, you'll need to request for the device to be un-enrolled. This will remove the device's serial number from whatever organization is managing it, allowing you to use it as you wish. You can fill out the un-enrollment request form here.

 One-handed cradling will allow attackmen to move at full speed and use their body to shield the ball from defenders. However, it will take longer to pass or shoot as you must move your free hand back in position before you will be able to do either.
 The stick should be nearly parallel to your torso. #*Use your free hand to create room from the defender. Hold your arm out with your hand pointed to the ground while you run to keep defenders from getting too close.
 Keep your elbow bent. Make sure the face of the stick head faces your chest at all times., The side-to-side motion generated will generate the same kind of force as the up and down motion of the two-handed cradle technique.

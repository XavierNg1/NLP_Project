 As a parent, you know that you are going to have to set some boundaries for your children and that they are often going to be angry about that. In addition to being angry at you for bringing it up, and suggesting they get some fresh air, your teen is likely to be angry at themselves for “letting” themselves gain.


Understand that some of these emotions are not actually directed at you, but rather at themselves.
 Try to be direct once and ask your teen if they would consider getting a bit of exercise every once in a while. If met with opposition or outright hostility, switch tactics. You can leave healthy eating guides out to be read or you can send an email to your teen outlining what you are willing to help with.


If your teen continues to be angry, back off. The worst thing you can do at this point is to continue pushing. Give your teen some space and let them come to you when they are ready.
 Try to be as neutral as possible when discussing the need for an improved diet and exercise. Make suggestions for fun, active activities and hope that the teen picks up the hint. After moving tip toeing around it for a few days, the topic might come up more organically and without so much animosity.


Being angry and defensive is natural and acceptable. Being rude or openly disrespectful is not. Remind your teen that self-expression is fine but that you will not tolerate behavior that crosses the line.
 It may be easier to accept that there is a problem or a potential problem when hearing the idea from a third party. To make this appointment more subtle, schedule it for back to school (especially if there is a required physical) or before a class trip. If your child signs up for sports or activities, he or she may be required to have a physical for that as well.
 Instead, talk to your teen about staying healthy. This might open the conversation up more than a talk about weight would.

 Be aware of your surroundings, and park in a well-lit, well-traveled area whenever possible.;
,


Familiarize yourself with your vehicle's safety features. When you unlock the car, some vehicles with remote-unlock systems will flash the lights a specific number of times to indicate someone tampered with the vehicle while you were away.
 If you have no choice in the matter, leave the valuables out of sight, either in the trunk, tucked under a seat or at least completely covered by something inconspicuous.


Tuck the items away before you get to your destination. Otherwise, would-be robbers could watch and take note of where you put your valuables.



Glance beneath the vehicle and in the backseat before you get in.
Be aware of potential hiding places for troublemakers near your vehicle, such as thick undergrowth or a van with a sliding door facing toward you.
Be alert to any suspicious behavior from others nearby. This includes following you--closely or at a distance--and paying an unusual amount of attention to you. Your intuition often puts together subconscious clues before your mind does, so if you get a gut feeling that something isn't right, act on it.
 This helps you get in faster in case of emergency, and sharp, pointy keys make good self-defense weapons in a pinch.


Your life is worth more than your car or your valuables, so if somebody threatens your welfare to steal your belongings or your car, let them have it.
If somebody attacks you with intent to harm you or abduct you, fight back. Kick, scream, bite and make a scene to attract others' attention. If they get you in the car, they could take you away from any possible help.
If you have a remote-unlock key fob for your car, it likely has a panic button that sets off the car's lights and horn to attract attention. Familiarize yourself with the panic button's operation so you can use it in case of emergency.

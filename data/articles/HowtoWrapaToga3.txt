 Fold a sheet with the short ends together, until it is the proper length for your height. It should cover from your armpits to your legs. Decide on how much leg you want to show or cover.
 Holding the folded sheet horizontally behind you, pull both sides underneath your arms and around to your chest. Wrap under your arms to your backside and to your front-side.
 After you bring the wrapped sheet around to your chest, tuck one end into the top of the sheet, like a towel. Make sure the sheet holds snugly around your chest.
 Spend some time smoothing the layers and folds. Use safety pins to hold your wrapped toga in place.
 Tie a belt or rope just under the bust to help secure the wrap and make a flattering empire waist.

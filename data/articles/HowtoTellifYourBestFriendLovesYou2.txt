 When people are attracted to someone, they often display this attraction through their body language. There are a number of different body language cues for attraction, and when you notice your best friend displaying them consistently it can signal that they’re attracted to you. Look for signs like:They maintain eye contact and gaze at you.
They smile subconsciously while they’re talking about you.
They try to be physically close to you by initiating physical contact.
When you talk, their feet are pointed towards you.
They mirror your body language when you two are speaking.
They touch their hair and face while you’re talking., When someone is interested in you, they will try to initiate physical contact more frequently. The two of you might go from not hugging frequently to hugging every time you see each other.The type of physical contact that you have may start to be different as well. Rather than punching you on the arm affectionately, they may initiate a hug. Or, they may start to touch your knee or your arm.
 Physical contact between friends is normal and healthy, but you may start to notice that they are initiating contact much more frequently than they normally do. They may try to be physically affectionate by hugging you, putting their arm around your shoulder, or touching your hand.They may try to “accidentally” brush against you when the two of you are close. This could mean that they are nervous to initiate other kinds of physical contact, like a hug, but they want to be near to you.
If you feel uncomfortable with the amount of physical contact, you should let them know in a gentle and kind way.

 Before a member speaks, he must be acknowledged by the chairperson. Depending upon your organization’s procedure, he should either raise his hand or standing and state “Mr./Madam Chairperson.” The member is not allowed to continue speaking until the chairperson has acknowledged him by name.


It is against procedure to begin speaking until the last speaker has finished his statement.;
, To bring a motion to consideration by the group, a member must be acknowledged by the chairperson. At which point, the speaker can say “I move that we (motion).” For the motion to be discussed another speaker must rise and say “I second that we (motion).”


The motion is some sort of substantive proposal that the organization is can enact. The debate should focus exclusively on whatever the current motion is.
For example, “I move that we pass the budget as is.”
Oftentimes, motions to be voted on will be set on a predetermined agenda. Robert’s Rules of Order, however, allow this agenda to be amended, by either adding motions, taking motions off the agenda, changing the order of the motions, or amending the motions., Debate over the motion does not begin until the chairperson restates the motion and asks “are you ready for the question?” If no one stands to discuss the motion, then it goes straight to vote., If debate over the motion ensues, the person who moved the motion has the first right to speak. Since it is his motion, he has the most direct knowledge of its intent and can explain it better than his peers., The rules are meant to ensure that all debate centers on the merits of the particular motion under discussion. Discussion of anything else can be ruled out of order.


All remarks should be directed at the chairperson. This is designed to prevent cross talk between the members that could escalate into a personal confrontation.You are not permitted to discuss personalities or motives. You should refrain from alluding to people by name or using language that is not courteous.
No member is permitted to speak twice until everyone else interested in speaking has spoken at least once.Ideally, debate should alternate between speakers who are pro and con.
Comments should be specifically directed at either a motion or the amendment, not both, so as to make the import of the comment clear., Anyone can ask to have the wording of the motion changed. To do this, he must be acknowledged by the chairperson. Then, they should stand and say “Madame Chair, I move that the motion be amended by adding the following words _________.” Another member must second, and then a majority vote can be held.


Alternatively, one can ask that “Madame Chair, I move that the motion be amended by striking the following words _________.” One can even ask to both add and subtract words for the motion: “Madame Chairperson, I move that the motion be amended by adding the following words ____________, and by striking the following words _________.”If the person who made the motion is friendly to the amendment, he can stand and ask to modify the motion, and no majority vote is required.If the motion is changed, the person who originally seconded it is entitled to withdraw support. At that point, it will be necessary to find another person to second the motion., After debate has slowed, the chairperson can stand and ask again “Are you ready for the question.” If no one stands to continue the debate, the chairperson will ask “As many as are in favor, say ‘Aye.’ Those opposed say ‘nay.” After counting votes, the chair will announce the results.


When the chair announces the results, she will either say “The ‘ayes’ have it, and (repeat the text of the motion)” or “The nays have it and the motion fails.”Alternatively, a member can call the motion to vote. Once being acknowledged, announce “I move the previous question.” The chair will call a vote. A 2/3rds majority is required to end the debate. At that point, a separate vote will be held on the motion.

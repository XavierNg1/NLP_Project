 Traditionally, at old diners, the cooks would slice dry toast (without butter) in half vertically, and would slice buttered toast on the diagonal, so that the waitresses would could differentiate between them quickly and easily. Plus, everybody knows diagonally-cut toast tastes better, right?

Nutella
eggs, fried or scrambled

, Great for a side to lunch or a snack in and of itself, a toasted cheese or a cheese toast is a simple slice of bread topped with melted cheese. Made traditionally with cheddar, you can use any cheese you like. To make it, the oven is your best bet.


Toast the bread on one side and remove from the oven. Top the untested side with slices of your favorite kind of cheese, or a shredded variety.
Return the bread to the oven so the bread continues toasting on the top side, melting the cheese at the same time. Remove from the oven when the cheese is bubbly and the toast is brown.

 In his later years, legend has it, the singer favored nothing so much as an enormous white-bread peanut butter, banana, grape jelly, and bacon sandwich, fried up in bacon grease. You think toast is good? Try frying it in bacon grease and topping it with that mess. You're in Fat-Elvis heaven. To make the sandwich:


Fry up a few slices of bacon in a skillet, reserving the grease. Remove the bacon and make a peanut butter sandwich on white bread, topping it with the bacon and a generous portion of sliced banana and your favorite jelly.
Return the whole sandwich into the skillet with the grease in it, frying it evenly on both sides and heating it throughout. When the bread becomes toasty and golden, it's ready to eat. Be sure to use a napkin.

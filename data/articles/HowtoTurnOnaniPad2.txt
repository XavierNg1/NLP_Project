 If your iPad is having problems completing the startup process, consider updating the software on your iPad. For example, if your screen is stuck on a red or blue screen or the apple icon freezes on the screen, run an update on your iPad to restart your iPad.


An update will allow you to reinstall your iOS software without deleting your data. If you are able to run this update, your iPad may start functioning again. If you do not have a computer with iTunes, borrow a computer that has iTunes.
 Do this only as a last resort. Press down the home and sleep/wake button. Do not stop holding when you see the Apple icon. Keep holding down the sleep/wake button until the recovery mode screen appears.
 Do not select recover. A screen will pop up after you force your iPad to restart. Follow the steps to update your iPadâ€™s iOS software.


If your iPad takes longer than fifteen minutes to download the update, your iPad will exit the update. If this happens, you will need to repeat the steps above to try again to update your iOS software.

 Place the egg in a saucepan of cold water, then bring the water to a boil over a medium heat until the egg is hard boiled. Remove the egg from the hot water and leave to cool. Once cooled, peel the egg and chop it finely or push it through a sieve.
 Add the chopped eggs, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, cloves, sugar, relish, red pepper and olives to a medium bowl and stir until blended thoroughly.









Unlike other Thousand Island recipes, this version does not contain any ketchup, so it will be white in color, rather than pink.
 Place the dressing in a sealed container and allow it to chill in the refrigerator for up to an hour, letting the sugar dissolve and the flavors combine.
 Serve the chunky Thousand Island dressing spooned over crisp salad leaves. It will keep in a sealed plastic container in the refrigerator for up to a week.

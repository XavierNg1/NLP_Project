 Positive people have compassion and empathy towards others. They have the courage and ambition to follow their dreams and goals, and encourage others to do the same. Positive people value self-care; they have coping mechanisms when they feel stressed, sad, angry, and frustrated.Positive people leave you feeling uplifted, refreshed, and hopeful about yourself and your future.
Notice how you feel after speaking with someone. Do you feel hopeful, happy, and lifted? Or do you feel down, discouraged, and negative? Pay attention to these feelings, and choose to spend time with those who leave you feeling good.
 Join a club, a workout group, or a volunteer group. You will be able to meet new people who have different views and outlooks on life. This way, you can expand or change your own views for the better.For example, if you like photography, join a photography club. Or, if you have always admired people who volunteer, join a volunteer organization of your choice.
 First define for yourself what traits a positive person has. Is it someone who always finds a way to smile, someone who sees the good and tries to help, or someone who knows how to cope with negative feelings and situations? By defining this for yourself, you will be able to tune into people who are like this.


When you find people who you have common ground with, befriend them. Ask them out for a cup of coffee and get to know them better. Find inspiration from their life stories, and share yours, as well.

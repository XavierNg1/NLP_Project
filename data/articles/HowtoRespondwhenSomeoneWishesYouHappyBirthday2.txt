 When possible, thank someone in person after he gives you a birthday present, or puts extra effort into a birthday wish. Give each friend or group of friends your full attention, smile, and make eye contact while delivering your thanks. Here are some ideas on how to do it:


Your card meant a lot to me. It really cheered me up.
That was the perfect birthday gift! You know me so well.
See the example section below for more ideas.
 Relatives and friends older than yourself tend to appreciate receiving a thank you card in the mail. Always add a handwritten message.A short thank you message is fine, but adding a heartfelt message is recommended for people who have been unusually generous or kind.


Look at the examples section if you need ideas on what to write.
 Make your friend feel special for her contribution to your birthday celebration, and to your life. Mention the specific gift she gave you, or the card she sent. Tell her how you will use the gift, or that you will "enjoy it for a long time."

, Never criticize the gift your friend sent you, bring up something embarrassing, or do anything else that might upset him. If you dislike the gift, try to find something about it that you do enjoy, or thank him for taking the time to pick out (or create) such a thoughtful gift.

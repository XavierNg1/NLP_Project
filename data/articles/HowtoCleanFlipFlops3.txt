 This first step should wash away the heaviest grime from extremely dirty flops. If a standard faucet doesn't do the trick, try using a powerful jet-stream or blocking off the tip of a hose with your thumb.
 First, fill a bucket with warm, soapy water. Dunk the flip flops in the water. Consider weighting them so that they are completely submerged. Leave the flops to soak for at least two hours.Use concentrated dish soap, if you have it. If your flip flops are white and incredibly dirty, you can add bleach – but be careful not to get it on your skin.
 After a few hours, remove the flops from the bucket. Rub the dirty surfaces vigorously with a toothbrush or a sponge. If the grime runs especially deep, try using steel wool or another highly abrasive surface – but be careful not to wear down the surface of the flops!

, This step should wash away the soap, the suds, and any other cleaning agents that you used. Rinse away any grime that you dislodged with your scrubbing.
 If the flip-flops won't get clean, be persistent. Keep rinsing and scrubbing until they are.
 Avoid running them through a drying machine, and don't expose the material to excessive heat. Put the flip flops out in the direct sun, and they should dry within a matter of hours.

 Look into symbology (or semiotics) to understand proper meaning behind symbols. Look up mythology (especially Greek mythology) to have a better understanding of the significance of common symbols and text.;
, Are you a pianist? Give your pony a piano. Are you a writer? Give them a quill and ink.
 Depending on whether or not your OC is a representation of you, you can use symbols from any reach of pop culture. If you like Star Wars, use a lightsaber or Stormtrooper helmet.
 A cutie mark determines what your pony is destined to be good at. Do you have a job that you excel at? Granted, a burger grill or office cubicle probably won't tickle your fancy for a cutie mark, but think outside the box.
 Is your pony a crime-fighter vigilante? Give them a mask as a cutie mark.
 Is your OC based on or heavily influenced by a particular theme? Electronics, holidays, or even other fandoms. If your pony is say, Christmas-themed, give them a candy cane or holly wreath.
 You may or may not consider yourself an outstandingly virtuous person, but everyone has a significant virtue. Try referring back to the symbol studies. Come up with something that visually and accurately represents your virtue. A magnifying glass could represent curiosity, an hourglass could represent patience, a shield could represent perseverance, and so on.
 Think outside the box. The My Little Pony fandom is large and ever-growing, and only a fraction of those fans have OC's, but that's still a lot.
 If you like it, test how it looks on your pony.
 Once you have an eligible candidate for your pony, choose it and add it to your pony.

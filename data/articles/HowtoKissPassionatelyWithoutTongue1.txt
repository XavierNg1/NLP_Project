 There is no rush! The great part about kissing is that you’re taking time away from the world to enjoy your partner. You don’t need to scramble into things like the world is about to end. In all honesty, you will probably find it to be much more romantic and rewarding if you take the time to explore each other than if you kiss super fast and chaotically. Try it.;
, This is a great technique for romantic kissing. As you are kissing normally, pull back just slightly and see how the other person responds. If they follow you then you can continue kissing, and potentially even push them forward very slightly back in the other direction. However, this maneuver works best if you create a slight separation between your lips. This manufactures of a moment of romance, with your lips only slightly apart and your bodies close together.
 This should be a natural position. While you are kissing your lips are generally slightly parted and you aren’t always meeting your partners lips directly head on. Aim for the lower lip and then before pulling away suck on it a little bit or give it a tiny bite. This will feel new and exciting for your partner and it also adds some sensation.
 Sometimes less is more. By pecking softly, you are setting the stage for more to come and it can also be very romantic if you pause on your partners face during one of the pecks and breathe out slowly that can add to the romance. , Greeting with a passionate kiss can be a nice surprise and lead into passionate kissing. The same goes for a good morning kiss or a goodbye kiss. Really there is never a bad time for a kiss, but these times can help punctuate a kiss and make it more passionate than it otherwise would have been. Try to think of romantic occasions to kiss your partner.

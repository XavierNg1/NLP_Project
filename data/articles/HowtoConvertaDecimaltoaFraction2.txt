 A periodic decimal is a decimal with a repeating pattern that never ends. For example, 2.345454545 is a periodic decimal. This time, we'll be solving for x. Write x = 2.345454545.
 In this example a single power of 10 will suffice, so write "10x = 23.45454545...." You have to do this because if you multiply the right side of the equation by 10, you have to multiply the left side of the equation by 10 too.
 In this example, let's multiply the decimal by 1000. Write,"1000x = 2345.45454545...." You have to do this because if you multiply the right side of the equation by 1000, you have to multiply the left side of the equation by 1000 too.
 This will set them up to be subtracted. Now, place the second equation over the first, so that 1000x = 2345.45454545 is lined up over 10x = 23.45454545 just as it would be in a regular subtraction problem.
 Subtract 10x from 1000x to get 990x and subtract 23.45454545 from 2345.45454545 to get 2322. Now you have 990x = 2322.
 Now that you have 990x = 2322, you can find "x" by dividing both sides by 990. So, x = 2322/990.
 Divide the numerator and denominator by any common factors. Compute the GCD of the numerator and denominator to ensure that you have fully simplified. In this example the GCD of 2322 and 990 is 18, so you can divide both 990 and 2322 by 18 to simplify the numerator and denominator of the fraction. 990/18 = 129 and 2322/18 = 129/55. Therefore, 2322/990 = 129/55. You're done.

 Internet Explorer and Firefox do not have built-in tools to create PDF files. Instead, you'll need to install a "virtual printer" that will create a PDF file instead of actually printing. CutePDF is one such virtual printer.


Go to cutepdf.com/products/cutepdf/writer.asp and click "Free Download" and "Free Converter". This will download the two programs required to install.
This method will only create a PDF from the page you are currently viewing. If you need to save an entire website, including any other linked pages, click here.
 The installer comes packed with several browser toolbars, so make sure to click Cancel on the first offer and then click the "Skip this and all remaining offers" link that appears.
 You don't need to select any options or worry about adware for this part; it's all automatic and ad-free.
 Now that CutePDF is installed, you can do this from any browser.
 The quickest way to do this is to press Ctrl+P, though you can find it in the File menu or the Firefox menu.


In Firefox, you'll need to click the Print... button in the Print Preview window.
 Click the Print button.
 After a moment, the CutePDF Save window will appear, allowing you to name the file and choose a location.

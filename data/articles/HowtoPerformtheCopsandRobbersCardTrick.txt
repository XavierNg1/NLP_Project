;
, Do this by by keeping one Jack on the bottom of the deck, and by taking out the other three Jacks, and one King.
 Say, "Here I have three Jacks that are bank robbers and the one King that is a cop". Be quick when you show the cards to your audience, or they may notice that something with wrong with your trick.
 Remember that the deck still has the Jack on the bottom.
 Put the Jack at the very bottom of the deckâ€”on top of the Jack that is already there.
 Put this Jack anything in the deck; you do not need to remember where that Jack is.
 Put the jack on the top of the deck and put the King on top of the Jack.
 Cut the deck in half and put the bottom half on top of the top half.
 You will soon find that they will all be together.

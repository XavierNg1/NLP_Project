 If an odor lingers after you have cleaned the stain, baking soda is great at neutralizing odor. Sprinkle baking soda over the area that smells. Work the baking soda into the carpeting using a scrub brush. Then, vacuum the baking soda out of the carpet., A mixture of hydrogen peroxide, vinegar, and baking soda can be used to remove pet odors. In a spray bottle, add five ounces of hydrogen peroxide with a teaspoon of vinegar, a teaspoon of baking soda, and half a teaspoon of orange-scented dishwasher soap. Shake the bottle until everything mixes together completely.Spray your mixture over the area that smells. Get the carpeting very wet for the best effect. When the mixture dries, it becomes a powder.
Once the mixture has become a powder, vacuum it up.
 If you cannot get a smell out, it may have sunken deep into your carpeting. Dogs are attracted to the smell of urine and may continue to go in the same place. If a smell lingers despite your efforts, consider replacing the portion of carpeting that is causing the issue. This is sometimes the only way to deter dogs from urinating in inappropriate places.

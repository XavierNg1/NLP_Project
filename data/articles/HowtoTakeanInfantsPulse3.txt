 A fast heart rate I considered a pulse rate of more than 160 beats per minute at rest. A fast heart beat does not allow the heart to have sufficient time to fill before it contracts, so blood flow to the different parts of the body is compromised., A slow heart rate is considered less than 140 beats per minute at rest. If the heartbeat is slow, the heart is unable to supply enough blood to the different parts of the body.
 Normally, the heart makes two sounds during each beat: “lub”, which is considered the first heart sound (S1) and “dub”, which is the second heart sound (S2). A third heart sound (S3), is often described as a horse gallop sound, which makes the heartbeat sound like “lub du bub”.A third heart sound can be related to conditions such as congestive heart failure (the heart muscle does not pump enough blood), cardiomyopathy (weakening of the heart muscle) and valvular regurgitation (backflow of blood because of incompetent valves)., This fourth sound, which is called S4, makes the heartbeat sound like “Be lub dup”—S1, then S4, then S2.A fourth heart sound can be related to conditions such as the stenosis of heart blood vessels (narrowing of blood vessels), ischemia (lack of oxygen supply to the heart), cardiomyopathy (weakening of heart muscle) and valvular regurgitation

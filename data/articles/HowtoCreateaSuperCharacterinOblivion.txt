, To do this, you'll have to exploit glitches. If you're uncomfortable about doing that, skip this step. You can exploit the Dorian or Kvatch Horseback glitch. Either one is fine. Make sure you don't collect too much gold; it can really stuff your game. One way to get cash without exploiting glitches is to get a huge amount of ingredients (They can be found anywhere, and are pretty easy to get.)and make a lot of potions, even if they don't do anything. sell them all (Preferably to the same merchant, it raises their disposition if you sell to them often), and watch your mercantile and alchemy skills soar! When you are a master in alchemy, make huge amounts of potions with one ingredient each, and using your high mercantile, haggle and get a good price for each of them. Remember, it is also good to do the standard "Dungeon Raiding" technique, these are just if you want to save time.
 Thieves Guild is optional; Dark Brotherhood is strongly recommended. Take armour, enchanted items, etc. from the Guild Halls.
 If you prefer, you can be a bad guy, though; it's a roleplaying game after all.
 The Ayleid Ruins, especially, as most of them contain Welkynd Stones and Varla Stones.
 Do not apply Night Eye, Chameleon, Detect Life or Water Walking permanently. It'll be a pain.

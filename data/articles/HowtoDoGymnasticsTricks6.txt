Point your toes down and touch the beam. Hold this position for five seconds., As the name suggests, create a V silhouette by crunching your abs, bracing yourself with your hands on the beam behind you. Point your toes with your legs at a 45 degree angle from the beam. Hold this pose for 5 seconds.Depending on your flexibility, this may take time to be able to lean back and raise your legs to create a V shape.
 When straddling the beam, swing your feet back to get yourself into a pushup position. Hold this position for five seconds and then walk your feet forward inch by inch. Focus on the movement by letting your toes hit the heel of the opposite foot. Once your feet touch your hands, move your hands slightly forward and perform a donkey kick with one leg.

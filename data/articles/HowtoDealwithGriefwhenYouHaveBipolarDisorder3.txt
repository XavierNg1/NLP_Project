 Think back to how your manic and depressive episodes typically started in the past. Be on the lookout for these symptoms, so you can catch any mood swings early.For instance, if you tend to be fatigued at the start of a depressive episode, don’t ignore any unusual feelings of tiredness now.
You may be able to prevent a mood episode from getting out of hand if you catch it early enough.
 Track your moods every day, and notice whether there are any overall patterns or trends. You can monitor your moods with a notebook, printed charts, or an app., When you’re grieving, you are particularly vulnerable to depression. If your mood is consistently low, you feel hopeless, or you don’t want to go on living, see your doctor or therapist.It’s normal to deal with intense negative feelings while you’re grieving. When you also have bipolar disorder, though, these feelings can easily turn into a full-blown depressive episode.
 People with bipolar disorder are at increased risk for developing complicated grief. If you can’t stop thinking about your loss, refuse to accept what happened, or aren’t feeling any better after several months, let your doctor or therapist know.Typically, if your grief lasts for more than six months, it is a form of complicated grief.
Someone with complicated grief remains mentally stuck in a state of intense sadness or anger.
Therapy is usually necessary for someone to heal from complicated grief.
 If you think you’re entering a state of mania or depression, contact someone on your medical team immediately. Don’t wait and hope your symptoms go away. Bipolar mood disturbances and grief can feed off each other if left unaddressed.

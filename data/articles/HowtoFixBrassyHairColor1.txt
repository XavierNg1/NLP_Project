 When hair color turns brassy, the tones range from yellowish orange to copper. In general, those with darker blonde shades will end up with brassiness that is copper toned, while lighter blonde shades usually lean toward more yellow tones. Once you’ve figured out which camp you fall into, you can more effectively combat your brassy strands.It is possible to have both yellow and copper toned brassiness present in your hair color.;
, Blue (silver) toned shampoos will cancel out copper brassiness. This works because blue and purple are opposite orange and yellow on the color wheel, effectively counteracting the brassy tones. There is a wide variety of options, ranging from affordable drug store versions to pricey salon products.If you can't determine your brassy tones, or if they seem to be both yellow and copper, use a shampoo that has both purple and blue tones in it.
Look for products that claim to be "color correcting" or "tone correcting." You can also ask a clerk at the beauty supply store for recommendations.
 You shouldn’t use blue/purple shampoos every day – stick to using them only a few times each week. In between blue/purple shampoos, use hair products made specifically for color care. There are shampoos, conditioners, masques and more that will help you preserve your color and fight brassiness without the use of blue/violet pigment.


Avoid hair care products that are alcohol-based. These will accelerate color fading and dry out your locks., Investing in a shower head filter might seem a little excessive (they’re about $150) but when you consider how much money can go into coloring your hair, it’s actually quite an investment.


Not only is the filtered water a bonus for your hair health, but your skin will love it, too.

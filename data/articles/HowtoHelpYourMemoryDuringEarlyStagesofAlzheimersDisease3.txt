 Doing some form of physical exercise can help you stay motivated and aware of your surroundings. Exercise can also slow the progression of Alzheimer's, making it an essential part of your treatment plan. Consider signing up for a weekly exercise class at your gym or community center. Or you may get in the habit of working out at home at a set time every day using workout videos.Consider a workout buddy. You may find it easier to get to class if you arrange to go with someone else. Ask a friend to take a workout class with you or to do exercises with you at your home.
 Socializing with others on a consistent basis can help you stay focused, motivated, and sharp. You may arrange weekly get togethers or dinners with family to help you all stay connected and in touch. Or you may have daily coffee dates with a friend to check in with each other and chat.During your interactions with others, try to get in the habit of discussing current events. You may talk about the latest international issue or a local event in your area. Talking about current events with others can help you stay sharp and aware of what’s going on.
 You may find that you need support outside of your social network, especially if you enjoy meeting new people. Ask your doctor to refer you to a support group for those with early stage Alzheimer’s disease or look up support groups online. Support groups can be a good way to connect with others who share your experience and to feel like you are not alone.You may also be able to learn tactics for keeping your memory sharp through the support group. Share information with other members in the group and be willing to receive advice or guidance from others about how to help your memory stay strong.

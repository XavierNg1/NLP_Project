 There are many foods that humans eat which are very dangerous (and potentially lethal) to dogs, such as grapes and chocolate. Make a list of these foods and hang it on a wall or on the refrigerator, so that the entire family sees it as a reminder. Include candy (as well as chocolate and gum, which children also receive when trick-or-treating) on this list., To make sure that your kids are vigilant about keeping their Halloween candy away from the family dog, talk to them honestly about the dangers involved. Be gentle but firm about conveying the information so that they understand why they are not allowed to share sugary treats with their pet. Keep things simple but direct by saying things like:“Eating chocolate will make the dog very, very sick, and too much can be poisonous.”
“Candy and gum can very dangerous for the dog because it might choke on them.”

, Regulate when and where your children are eating their Halloween candy to avoid your dog gaining access to any that might be dropped, discarded, or forgotten about. For instance, have a specific “snack time” after school or after supper, when children can enjoy their treats. Have this happen in one room of the house (e.g. in the kitchen) and keep the dog in another room for that time.Be sure to clean up thoroughly after your children finish enjoying their Halloween candy by properly disposing of wrappers, sweeping the floor, and wiping down the surface they ate on.

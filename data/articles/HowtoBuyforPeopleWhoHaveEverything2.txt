 Inscribe the book with a note explaining why you love the book and what it means to you. You can also include an invitation for a drink (your treat) once they’ve finished the book so you can talk about it., You can invite them to your home and cook your favorite meal for them. This lets them try a type of cuisine they might not otherwise try and gives them a night off from cooking. You can also put together the ingredients for your favorite meal or treat, and include detailed, step-by-step instructions. In both cases, they’ll get to enjoy something you love, too., You can also burn the playlist to a CD if you like. The more variety the better – you might introduce them to music they’ve never heard before, and make a new fan for one of your favorite groups.
 You can also switch this to beer if the recipient prefers beer to wine. Choose your favorite bottle (or two), and include a card that describes what you like so much about that type of wine. You can even include a suggestion for the type of food they could enjoy with them.

For example, you could say something like "I found this wine when I was on vacation in New England. I love the fruity flavor of it, and how light it is. Try it with a piece of chocolate!"

 Locate the app on your device and tap its icon to start playing the game.


If you don’t have Clash of Clans yet, you can download the game from your device’s dedicated app store (iTunes App Store for iOS and Google Play for Android).;
, This will slide open the message panel.
 Do this by tapping the “Clan” tab on the message panel and pressing the “i” button.
 Type the name of the clan you want to join and press the “Search” button. A list of clans related to your search query will appear on the window.


If you don’t have a clan name in mind, some recommended clans will appear on the lower part of the Search Window prompt, which you can opt to join instead.
 To join any of the clans listed, just tap the “Join” button beside the name of the clan of your choice. The “Clan” tab of the message panel will now be filled with all the chat messages coming from other members of the clan you’ve just joined.
 You’ll find the icon on the lower left-hand corner of the screen; it will take you to the Clan War section.


In the Clan War section, all the things you need about wars can be found.
 If you’re the leader of the clan (or at least the co-leader), you’ll find a button here that says “Start a War.” Press this button and the game will start searching for an opposing clan that is a match (based on your level) to yours. This may take a couple of minutes to complete. You can minimize or close the game while the search is in progress.


If you’re an elder or just a member of a clan, you cannot start a clan war search. All you can do is to wait for your leaders or co-leaders to start the war, or you can talk to them and ask to start one through the message panel.
 Once the game finds an opposing clan for your group to fight, each of the members will receive a notification on their smartphones or tablets. Each of the two clans now has exactly 24 hours to prepare for war and fight in it.


Congratulations! You’ve just found or started a clan war!

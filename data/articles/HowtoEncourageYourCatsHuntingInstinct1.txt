 Cats love enclosed spaces that allow them to safely observe their territory and stalk prey. The most affordable way to provide your cat with stalking spots is to leave out a few cardboard boxes. Use different sized boxes and arrange them in interesting configurations.Save your boxes whenever you make a purchase or get a delivery. Just make sure you get rid of packaging materials like plastic, tape, and styrofoam.;
, A collapsible cat tunnel can also provide a great stalking spot for your cat.  Purchase one online or from your local pet supply store for under $20 (US). You can find simple straight tunnels or more elaborate varieties that have multiple tunnel sections.You can fold up and put away a collapsible tunnel when it’s not in use, which you might find a more attractive option than keeping cardboard boxes around the house.
 Cats instinctively love seeking out high spots to observe their territory and look for prey. A climbing tree or perch will satisfy this urge. Expanding your cat’s space vertically is also perfect if limited floor space is an issue.While there are plenty of ways to save money by using boxes and improvised toys, make sure you invest in a solid perch. When shopping for one, ask a salesperson to recommend a sturdy model or, if you shop online, read the reviews.

 Sprinkle an even layer of sugar in the bottom of a heavy skillet or saucepan. Be sure the pan is large enough to accommodate the sugar's expansion.
 Cook the sugar on medium heat. You will notice the edges of the sugar will begin to brown and cook first. With a clean heatproof utensil, push the liquefied sugar towards the middle of the pan.


You want to make sure to move the liquefied sugar so it doesn't begin to burn. Once burnt, it cannot be saved.
If lumps begin to form, turn down the heat slightly and stir slowly. The lumps should melt by the time you are done., The process here will begin to speed up, so don't leave the stove. Watch as the sugar deepens in color to a rich amber. If a recipe you are using calls for the addition of a liquid (like cream), add it in now to cool the pan and slow the cooking process.


Use caution when adding liquid to the pan as it will bubble up.
If you are using the caramel in a mold (for flan or cr√®me caramel) pour it into the mold now.
To make pralines, add a cup of toasted, chopped nuts to the pan. Stir them slightly with a couple pinches of salt, and pour the mixture onto a wax-paper lined baking sheet to cool., If you are not adding liquid to your caramel, another way to cool it down (and stop the cooking process) is to set the base of the pan in a large bowl of cold water. Clean the pan by soaking or boiling water in the pan until all of the caramel has melted away.
 Enjoy!

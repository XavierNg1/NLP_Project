 Use the plastic prying tool provided for your device, or another a thin plastic tool. A credit card or plastic ID will work. Insert it along the side, between the frame and the body of the Nook. Move the tool around the Nook HD to slowly remove the frame from the front of the device.Go slowly and use care so you don’t break the frame.
A guitar pick is also a great option for prying the frame off.
There may be some glue attaching the frame, which will require you to take a little more time prying it off.
 Use a size T5 Torx screwdriver to remove all of the screws. Get a cup or bowl and place the screws in it for safekeeping as you remove them. There are seventeen screws around the edge of the Nook.This type of screw can only be removed with a Torx screwdriver, so buy or borrow one if you don’t already have one.
 Once the screws are removed, flip the nook facedown and gently pull the back away. It is attached to the motherboard by a cord, so don’t yank on the back cover or you may damage the cord.

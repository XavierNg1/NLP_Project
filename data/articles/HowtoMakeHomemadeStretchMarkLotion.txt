 A glass bottle will work best as long as it has a cork or lid so you can maintain the oilâ€™s freshness.


Run bottle through the dishwasher to sterilize or
Deposit bottle in boiling water (use gloves when handling bottle).
Allow bottle to dry so no water remains inside.;
, Place block in a double boiler and set it on the stove on a low setting. Watch closely as oil melts and use immediately. Don't walk away as this oil could burn or scorch if left unattended.
 If necessary use a sterilized funnel to allow liquids to pour into bottle.
 The oils should combine nicely but give it a gentle swirl to ensure its well infused.
 Rub and massage oil into stretch marks, making sure you have saturated the skin.

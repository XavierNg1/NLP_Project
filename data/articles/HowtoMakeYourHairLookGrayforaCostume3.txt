 Use a wide toothed comb to brush all your hair out. Then take the comb and comb down a section of hair at the side of your face until midway down the hair shaft.Combing out your hair separates all the strands so that you can more evenly spray your hair.
If you have short hair, you don’t need to comb through your hair.
 Still holding the comb in your hair, spray the top of the section of hair you are combing lightly and evenly with gray or silver hairspray. If you have short hair, you can simply spray your entire head evenly and with the hairspray, building it up in layers if you want a more dramatic effect.You can find temporary gray or silver spray color at most beauty stores and Halloween stores.
Silver spray may be more common but it also may have a metallic effect, so it’s best to check the packaging or consult a store associate before purchasing a temporary silver hairspray.
Hairspray is very effective at coloring your hair, but it may make your hair stiff depending on how much you use.
 Once you have sprayed the top of the strand of hair you are combing, run the comb down your hair shaft and spray to the tips of your hair., Repeat the spraying process on your whole head, partially combing a section of your hair, spraying it from the top of your head down to the comb, then combing out the rest of the section and spraying. Use a mirror for the back of your head and apply the spray until you are satisfied with the result.Colored hairspray usually lasts from 1-3 shampoos.

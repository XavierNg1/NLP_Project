 Use a sturdy fabric. Cottons work well, as would corduroy, denim or heavier weight fabrics.


The stronger the fabric, the longer it'll last and endure being toted about and having sharp items poked into it if you can not find stronger fabric just double it.;
, These will depend upon the amount, length and width of the items you'll be placing inside the case. The shape of a square or rectangle works best for a pencil bag.


Use a ruler or measuring tape to work out the size of the bag; measure the contents and allow for a little extra room around the edges (for ease of movement) to calculate the total size.
 A zipper can be placed either at the short side or long side of a rectangle, depending upon your preference.

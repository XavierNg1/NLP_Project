 This is a fast process; it can be an easy part of your morning routine. Moisturizing is often thought of as a part of female skin care, but men will benefit from moisturizing as well.This will prevent your facial skin from drying out, and moisturized skin is a valuable part of a youthful appearance. Moisturizers will need to be applied daily to remain effective over time.
 Like moisturizing, exfoliation is a quick process that will keep your face looking young, and maintain the health of your skin. Many grainy scrubs can be purchased in drug stores or grocery stores; these inexpensive exfoliating products will clean your face, boost collagen production (which keeps your skin taut) and help remove dead skin cells., This will immediately help your skin look fresher and younger. Just rub an ice cube around your eyes, mouth, nose, and over your cheeksâ€”or if you have time, fill your sink with ice water and let your face soak in it. The ice will constrict the blood veins in your face and help your skin appear less puffy in general.Cooling your face will also:


Tighten your facial skin, helping it look better rested and younger.
Decrease the visibility of facial wrinkles.
Cleanse your pores and help prevent acne.

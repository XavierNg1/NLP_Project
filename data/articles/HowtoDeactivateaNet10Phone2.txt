 It would be best to make the most out of the service while you can, so use any airtime you still have on your Net10 phone. Make calls or send out text messages until your balance reaches zero.
 Write down your Net10 account number, current billing address, your birth date, and the last four digits of your social security number.
 Using another phone, dial the customer service number 1-877-TEN-CENT (1-877-836-2368) and wait for representative to assist you.
 The representative will ask the details about your account. Provide the representative the necessary information you’ve prepared.
 The representative will also ask for the serial number of the phone you wish to deactivate, which can be found on the battery area of the phone.


If you don’t know the serial number, you can also just give the phone number of the mobile phone you want to cut off, and the representative will deactivate it in their system.
 Try to make outgoing calls or send text messages. Deactivated phones shouldn’t be able to make any of these.

 Stains, holes, missing buttons, and rips will not get your items sold regardless of how fantastic they are. Buyers look for clothing in new and like-new condition. Most stores are not interested in selling ripped clothing.
 Properly wash, dry, and iron your clothes before you post a photo of them or bring them to a second-hand store. Wrinkled, dirty clothing suggests that you haven’t taken great care of your clothing, and drives down the estimated value., Which of these you do depends on how you decide to sell your clothes. Often, second-hand stores that give you cash on the spot will prefer your clothes be nicely folded in a bag, while consignment stores may want them pressed and on a hanger when you bring them in. Call or look on the company’s website to make sure that you’re adhering to their guidelines.

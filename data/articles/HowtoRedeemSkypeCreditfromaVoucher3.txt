 You can purchase a Skype voucher online instead of buying from a local shop. In this case, you will receive the voucher receipt and its code or number via email at your registered email address.


Go to your email account and log in to your account using your email ID and password. Check your mail inbox to find the “Skype voucher” mail.
 Open the email from Skype and click on the “Voucher Redemption” link or code included in the email.


You should be redirected to the Redeem Voucher page. The voucher number field should already be filled in with the correct code. Press Enter on your keyboard to redeem the Skype credit.
If you do not find any link in your mail, paste the code included in the email in the voucher number field and press Enter to redeem it.
After successfully redeeming your Skype voucher, you will get a confirmation email from Skype regarding your purchase or subscription. You will not be charged for such a notification.

 A therapist cannot prescribe medications for your ADHD. If you think that you may need to be on some sort of medication, then make an appointment with a psychiatrist.A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in treating mental health disorders.
 There are several medications available for those with ADHD, so you will need to discuss these options with your psychiatrist. Most of the medications prescribed for ADHD are stimulants, but there are also some non-stimulant options as well.


For example, Strattera is a non-stimulant ADHD medication. This drug may also help if you are dealing with depression or anxiety symptoms as well., Medication alone will not treat your ADHD. It will just minimize some of your symptoms. In order to get the most benefit from taking ADHD medication, you will need to use other therapies as well, such as talking to a therapist, getting regular exercise, or making dietary changes., Medications for ADHD can cause a variety of unpleasant side effects. Make sure that you monitor your physical and mental state closely and tell your doctor about any side effects that you notice.Stimulant medications have the most severe side effects, including insomnia, loss of appetite, weight loss, anxiety, and heart complications. Tell your doctor right away if you experience any negative side effects from your ADHD medication.
You may also have to try different medications if you have unpleasant side effects or if the medication does not seem to be helping., If you decide that you no longer want to take your medications, talk to your prescribing physician or psychiatrist first. You may need to taper off of the medication to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

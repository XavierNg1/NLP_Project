 Avoid allowing your own biases and negative mood to cloud your judgement. The anger you see in others might actually be the anger that is inside of you. Step away from the computer or phone for a moment before responding. Once you have a clearer head, you can revisit the situation and determine if addressing it is appropriate., The best way to find out if someone is angry is to ask them questions to get to the bottom of the issue, rather than assuming. Look back over the conversation or post and determine what questions you might have for them.For instance, you might ask “Hey, I noticed you reacted strongly when Monica mentioned going to a bar on your post. Is something going on?”

, Avoid beating around the bush and be direct with them, especially if they are commenting under your pictures or on your posts. Direct message them and ask them if they have an issue, and let them know that you are ready to talk.

Say something like “I’ve noticed that you regularly leave hateful comments on my pictures. Can you tell me what the purpose is in that?”

, If the person comes to you with a legitimate gripe about something you have done wrong, then you should apologize. Take responsibility for what you have done and make amends in words and in action.Say something like “I’m truly sorry for that mean comment I made. At the time, I meant it as a joke, but I see now that it was offensive and in poor taste. I apologize.”

, Know that some people are internet trolls, only trying to hurt and upset others by making mean comments or by being combative on purpose. Rather than taking the time to address this person, just block them. Keep any unnecessary negativity out of your life.

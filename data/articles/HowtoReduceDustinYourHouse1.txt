 If your house is heated and/or cooled by a central system, you can change the filters as a means of controlling dust levels in your air. Dust will continue to build up in your home, but a quality filter can slow down the rate of dust accumulation.


A standard air filter will only filter big particles from the air to prevent damage to your heating or cooling systems. To reduce dust, it is recommended that you use high-quality paper or pleated fabric filters that are disposable and replace them every 1 to 3 months.;
, These machines clean the air by trapping dust particles. They're great for high-dust households or families with dust allergies.Air purifiers only clean the air in the room they're in, so consider getting one for each bedroom and the living room.

 If you haven't made a YouTube account yet, make two. Simple as.;
, The best videos to do this are ones where a lot of people are debating on the quality of something, such as a music video or a film trailer. Find a video with a high amount of views to ensure that it's being viewed frequently (but not so frequently that comments are appearing every few seconds).
 Say anything you want - after, all, you're going to argue with yourself. Here's an example. On a movie trailer, say something like "Gee, this film is going to be awful." even if you think the film looks good.


, Make it long and detailed to get people's attention. Then, if anybody argues with you ("Stop fighting guys!") just use both your accounts to argue with other people: "But he started it!" *switch account* "No, HE started it!"

, As you continue talking to yourself remember to have one account make friends, the other make enemies, and vice versa. Attempt to get people to join each side to flesh it out. Depending on how much there is a debate on the video it might be difficult, but try your best. Then just watch the chaos unfold.
 The third character could be a mature person who's trying to sort the other two characters out.
 It can't be proven, especially, if you make both channels invisible, and if anybody seems suspicious, just have one of your accounts say "I'm the same guy as that loser?! No way!" and the other say "Too right, I wouldn't want to be like him!"

, Because you are in control you can take the joke to any extent you wish. Whether you let everybody know that you were playing pretend with yourself all along is up to you. It's not really a good idea, but some might find it funny, so go ahead if you want to.
 Next time you feel like doing it again, just find another video and start over from scratch.

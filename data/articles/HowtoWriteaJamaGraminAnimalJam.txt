 There are two simple ways to make a jam-a-gram personalized and more sincere:


The first way to make a Jam-A-Gram personal is by adding stickers. The default sticker is usually the holiday sticker. You can change the sticker, by clicking the flower icon next to the text selection.
The second way to make a Jam-A-Gram personal is by changing the Jam-A-Gram picture itself. Do this by clicking the large blue arrows.
 Read over the jam-a-gram, to make sure everything is written properly. Check the jam-a-gram picture and sticker to see if it is just as you like it. Now you can click the green send button. Your jam-a-gram has been delivered to that user!

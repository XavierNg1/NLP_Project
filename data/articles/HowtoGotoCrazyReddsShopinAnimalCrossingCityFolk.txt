 Once you're there, go to the City. Go west and knock on the door. Crazy Redd will claim that you aren't a member and ask you to come back with an invitation.;
, One of them might say if you have gone to Crazy Redd's in the City.


They will send you a letter saying that you need that letter and 3,000 bells to enter the shop.
 Crazy Redd will accept you and ask you to pay him 3000 Bells. He will give you 2 invitations so you can give them to your friends.

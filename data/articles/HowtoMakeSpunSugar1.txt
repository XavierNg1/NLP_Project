 Keep all of your supplies near your stove top or range so you aren't running around your kitchen with hot sugar. You'll need a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan on your stove. Set a large bowl of ice water on the counter next to the stove. You'll also need a small bowl of water, a pastry brush, and a candy thermometer.Make sure the saucepan will be able to fit inside the bowl with ice water.;
, Pour 1/2 cup of water in your saucepan. You'll also need to scoop in 1/2 cup of corn syrup and 2 1/2 cups of granulated sugar. Try not to get any of the granulated sugar on the sides of the saucepan since this can make the mixture crystallize.It may help to pour the granulated sugar directly into the center of the saucepan.
 Stir the mixture just once so that the water and sugars combine. Turn the heat onto medium-high heat so that the sugar dissolves. Avoid stirring the mixture while it cooks or it may crystallize and become grainy. The mixture will bubble and begin to darken a little. Keep cooking until a candy thermometer reads 293 degrees F (145 degrees C).To prevent crystallization, dip your pastry brush in some water and wipe down the sides of the saucepan. Take extra care not to burn yourself with the hot sugar.
 Once your sugar syrup has reached the proper temperature, you'll need to immediately stop it from cooking further. Use hot pads to carefully lift the saucepan off of the stove and plunge the bottom of the pot directly into the bowl of ice water. Keep the saucepan on the ice water for 5 seconds.This should bring the temperature of your sugar syrup down to around 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).

 While keeping the stem is a matter of personal preference when preparing many mushrooms, shiitake stems should always be removed. To remove a shiitake stem, tightly pinch it right where it meets the cap. Then slowly pry the stem away from the cap in the opposite direction the stem is leaning.For instance, if you’re holding the mushroom upside down and the stem is leaning towards you, pry the stem away from you.
Discard the stems or save them for use in soups and stocks.
 Dried shiitake mushrooms aren't quite as flavorful, but they can be good to keep on hand because they last a long time and are especially useful in some dishes. They do require a bit more prep work, however, as they need to be soaked in water prior to cooking. Just be sure to snap off the stems first, as it's much easier to do while they're still dry., Depending on how you wish to use your shiitake mushrooms, you may wish to cut them up. Thin slices are recommended. Place a cap right side up on a cutting board and carefully cut it into thin slices.If you’re comfortable doing so, you can stack one shiitake mushroom cap on top of another and slice them simultaneously in order to save time.

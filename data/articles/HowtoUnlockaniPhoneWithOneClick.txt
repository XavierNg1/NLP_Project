 To activate the Rest Finger to Open feature, your device will have to be running iOS 10; it must also have a Touch ID sensor.


To unlock your device, press and hold your finger on the Home button, then tap it again when the Lock screen appears.
You can tap your Home button again once your iOS device is unlocked to return to the Home screen.;
, The Settings app resembles a grey gear and can usually be found on the Home screen.
 This will open the General menu; you'll need to scroll down a ways to find the "Accessibility" tab.
 The Accessibility menu houses the settings for things like your iPhone/iPad's touch and magnification preferences.
 You can alter the way your Home button behaves from here.
 You should see this option at the bottom of the Home Button menu; if the switch turns green when you tap it, you have successfully enabled the Rest Finger to Open feature!, You'll want to familiarize yourself with the way Rest Finger to Open works.
 This should be a finger which you've scanned into your iOS device's Touch ID memory.
 After a second or so, your iOS device's display should wake up; shortly thereafter, your device should be unlocked and back on the Home screen!

, iOS devices have long been plagued by easily-broken Home and Lock buttons; using Rest Finger to Unlock will cut down on how often you have to use these buttons.
 The simple procedure for using Rest Finger to Open is quicker than the default unlocking procedure; this speed is particularly helpful if you're attempting to access Siri or your maps app while driving.

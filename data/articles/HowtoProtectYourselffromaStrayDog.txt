 Is it aggressive or afraid? Signs of aggression include: baring teeth, lifted tail, raised ears and hackles (the fur behind the neck, in many large breeds the hackles are very easy to see when they are lifted). Signs of fear include tucking the tail, laid back ears and also snarling or barking. Barking is a sure sign that the dog doesn't want you any closer than you already are.;
, Look for body language to understand what the dog is trying to convey. A dog's behavior is determined more by its training (or lack thereof) than its genetics.
 The most common situation is that a dog is lost, scared, and doesn't trust you. Even if they look frightening, their first instinct will be to repel you and get away.
 Do not try to command them. Note your location and, if the dog is unknown to you, call animal control immediately. If you know who the dog belongs to, of course, call them first!

, Do not run, as the dog will catch you and will be encouraged to bite. Many dogs instinctively know how to "take down" a runner, and the last place you want to be is on the ground. Search for something to climb onto and call for help.
 Do not aggravate an aggressive dog by shouting at it or staring into its eyes. Eye contact is aggressive and will likely spur an attack.
 Stay calm and try to keep your stance tall and confident. Walk away, if you aren't being chased, and call animal control at the first opportunity. Dogs are pack animals. When they are alone, they are not usually looking for confrontation.

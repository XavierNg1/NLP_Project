 These clouds usually have a height between 6,500 feet and 19,500 feet (1,981 meters and 5,943 meters). They are prefaced with the prefix "alto," and are known as either altocumulus or altostratus clouds. They tend to be less defined than lower clouds, although warmer middle clouds will display sharp edges due to water content, and colder middle clouds will show distinct edges shaped by ice crystals.


Scattered middle clouds against a blue sky indicate continued fair weather, and are often succeeded by clear skies and a high pressure system.
Altostratus clouds that are becoming lower and have southerly winds in the northern hemisphere (vice versa for the southern hemisphere) can indicate an oncoming storm, but this will usually be several hours away.
 Altocumulus clouds are the clouds that you usually see during summer days. They come in many small clouds that are spread across the sky. Altocumulus clouds form by convection (vertical atmospheric motions) and cold fronts. Altocumulus clouds usually are followed by warm and humid summer mornings then a thunderstorm in the afternoon.


You can tell the difference between altocumulus clouds and high level clouds by noting the shading. Altocumulus clouds usually have shading underneath portions of the clouds.
 This middle cloud isn't very exciting––it tends to be grayish and sheet-like without shape. You might spot a glow of the sun behind this cloud. It's a good idea to prepare for wet or snowy weather when this type of cloud crosses the sky.
 These lens-shaped clouds or "cloud caps" don't happen everywhere––they tend to only form over mountain ranges and peaks due to the way that winds travel up the slopes. You're probably okay on the ground, but if you're up on the mountain or flying overhead, expect strong winds or turbulence. If you are on a mountain and a cloud cap descends, expect bad weather and seek suitable shelter.

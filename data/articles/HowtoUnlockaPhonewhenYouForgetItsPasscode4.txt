 If your iPhone was disabled as the result of multiple failed login attempts, you’ll see a message that says “Device is Disabled”.This method will erase all of the content on your iPhone, so you should only use it if you’re unable to use iTunes Backup and Restore.


Unlike using iTunes Backup and Restore, you can complete this method with any computer using iTunes (not just the one you normally sync with).
 Keep holding these buttons down until you see the Recovery Mode screen. This screen is black and will display the iTunes logo and a connector, indicating that the device is connected to iTunes., Do this if you see the following text in a pop-up window: “iTunes has detected an iPhone in recovery mode. You must restore this iPhone before it can be used with iTunes.” Otherwise, move to the next step., You’ll see this button on a pop-up window that also contains the buttons “Cancel” and “Update.” Once you click “Restore,” iTunes will start the restoration process, which may take several minutes.
 When the restore is complete, your iPhone will rest. Follow the prompts to set your location, Wi-Fi, and create a new passcode.If you made an iCloud backup at an earlier date, select the option to “Restore from iCloud Backup” on the “Apps & Data” screen.
If you have no backup, select “Set Up as New iPhone” on the “Apps & Data” screen.

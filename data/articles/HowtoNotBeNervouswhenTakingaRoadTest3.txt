 Whether or not the examiner is friendly and polite, you should be. Make sure that you greet them kindly and ask any questions you have about instructions after they’re given., Remind yourself that your test instructor is a human just like everyone else. It doesn’t make them happy to see people fail, and they only want to ensure your safety and the safety of others. If you see them as helpful rather than as someone to be intimidated by, it'll help ease your nerves., Think before you act. Don’t let your nervousness encourage fast decision making. Acting too quickly may increase your chances of skipping something important. Also, driving above the speed limit is a big no-no during a road test. Slow and steady wins the race.

 You can resist the temptation to cheat by making sure you and your partner have good communication. This means acknowledging and discussing any issues before they get out of hand. Be honest with your partner and let them know how you are feeling. Only then can you both address the issue and come up with a solution that satisfies you both.For example, you may feel your partner works too late and this gives you too much time to spend with a person you are attracted to. You may then tell your partner, “I feel like you are working late too often. Is it possible for you to come home earlier in the day so we can spend more time together?”

, Active listening can help to ensure both you and your partner are communicating well. Be an active listener by maintaining eye contact with your partner when you are talking and by displaying open body language, where you turn your body toward your partner and keep your body relaxed.You should also avoid interrupting your partner and acknowledge what your partner has said after they are done speaking before you speak. You may say, “What I am hearing you say is…” or “I think you meant..”. Your partner should then agree that you have heard them correctly before you respond to them.
 You and your partner should work hard to maintain communication that is open and honest, especially if you are starting to feel tempted to be unfaithful. Rather than isolate yourself or shut down, be willing to open up to your partner. Tell them how you are feeling and be honest about your emotions.You may also consider getting professional help, such as a therapist or a counselor, to work through your communication issues together. You and your significant other may go to a therapist and support each other as you tackle your feelings for others and your struggle with monogamy.

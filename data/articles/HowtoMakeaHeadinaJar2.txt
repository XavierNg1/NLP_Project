 For this method, you'll want one with a wider mouth. As with the paper mask version, it should be about 5 liters.
 Visit your local Halloween or costume shop. Get a rubber zombie maskâ€”the more realistic, the better.


Politician masks are good to use, too, but they can be more frightening than zombies: use with caution.
 Backfill the mask with a balloon by putting it mostly into the jar, behind the mask, then inflating it until the mask is pressed up against the glass.
 Drop in a couple fake eyes, and some human hair, and fill the whole thing with water. You can add a drop or two of yellow and green food coloring to get that lovely formaldehyde hue. Add a little garden-variety dirt and shredded brown recycled paper towel to simulate decomposition.

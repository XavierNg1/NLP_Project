 Just look at the mirror, say 'I'm beautiful', 'I look nice today' or any other positive sentiments. Don't say bad things or think negatively about yourself. Believe you're that you're nice and a good person inside and out. If you believe that, then you will start making people at your school believe that too!;
, You shall pass!" You have to be serious about each school year, if you're serious enough than you will believe you can do it, you can study, pass, get the best marks, etc. It just requires faith and hard work.
 Let of go the old bad feelings. Forget about all the bad things you've been called in your old school. Forgive your old friends' misbehavior, such as making fun of you. Forget your embarrassing memories, since no one in your new school will know about it -- a new school is a new start.
 Take time for yourself. In the last couple of days before school starts just relax, play in your room perhaps and think about the good and cool things that may happen during this year. Stay positive! That's what confident people do!

, New you! Have a new look, get a trendy haircut, face cleaning maybe, eyebrows done... do anything that will make you feel confident and comfortable.

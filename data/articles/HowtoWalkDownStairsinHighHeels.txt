 Try to practice as often as you can, even in your room, until you can walk without stumbling. This is very important when you have to cross a surface that isn't flat.;
, When you first start walking in heels you may wish to be extra careful and watch your feet, but ultimately you need to learn to keep your head high, shoulders back, and back straight to reap the full benefits.
 Particularly if you are not at your peak of confidence in heels. The way to hold the railing without looking uncoordinated is to keep your grip strong but relax the rest of your arm including your shoulder. This will give you extra support allowing you to go downstairs safely until you have enough confidence to go without.
 Though with practice, you will be able to use the stance described in step 2 going downstairs, safety is key, so to begin with cast your eyes downwards and make sure you know where each foot will be going next. Even with time, make sure to be aware of both your head-on and peripheral vision and be aware of your body.
 Get as much of the heel and front of the shoe to step onto the stairs; this may be made easier through lifting the legs higher. It is best to be able to feel the back of the heel touching the back of the step.
 If you feel yourself slipping, immediately take hold of the railing. This is why it is always better to at least be touching it so you have that support.
 There's no point going down if you can't go up but luckily this is much easier. Just step with the front of the shoe, the heel SHOULD NOT touch the stair at all but be in mid air so its like you're walking in flats.

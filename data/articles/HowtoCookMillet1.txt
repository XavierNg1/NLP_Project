 Most stores sell up to 1 lb (or 16 oz) packages. Choose organic millet, if available, to gain more nutrients and to avoid potential exposure to pesticides.


You can find boxes or bags of millet in the rice and grains section of the store, or bag your own from a barrel or container in the bulk section.;
, Avoid millet that appears or smells musty or moldy.
 Seal the container tightly so the millet maintains freshness.

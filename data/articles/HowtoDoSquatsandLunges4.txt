Put your hands on your hips, keep your back as straight as possible, relax your shoulders and keep your eyes facing directly ahead. Engage your core.
Lunges should be performed on solid, even ground, not on an exercise mat. An exercise mat will simply throw you off balance.



The length of your step will depend on your height, but it will usually be somewhere between 2 or 3 feet (0.6 or 0.9Â m).
As you step forward, lower your hips and bend your knees until they both form 90 degree angles.
Your front knee should not extend over your toes and your back knee should not touch the ground.



Pause at the bottom of the lunge for up to five seconds.
Push off the heel of your front foot to return to the starting position.



Repeat the movement, this time with your opposite leg.
Remember to keep your muscles tight as you perform the exercise.

Then remove the leaves from the stalks of thyme., Place a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the diced onions and let them sit, stirring them occasionally with a spatula. Cook for five minutes., Shift the onions to the side of the saucepan, then add the mushrooms into the middle. Let the mushrooms cook for five minutes in the uncovered pan., After five minutes, start to stir the mushrooms and onions together. You should notice that the mushrooms have exuded a significant amount of water. Then add the thyme leaves, stir, and cook for ten minutes., After the soup has cooked with the thyme for ten minutes, drop in the bay leaf and stir it in. Then sprinkle in the ½ teaspoon of salt and ½ tablespoon of soy sauce., In a medium sized bowl, measure out the vegetable broth and then add one tablespoon of tapioca starch. Stir the ingredients together until the tapioca starch dissolves., After you have finished mixing, pour the tapioca and broth mixture into the large saucepan of mushrooms. Then pour in the almond milk and stir to mix the ingredients., Let the soup cook uncovered for around fifteen minutes. Add black pepper, then taste. If you want a more matured flavor, or you feel the mushrooms haven’t been cooked enough, let the soup continue to cook. Add additional spices if you wish., When you are satisfied with the flavor of the soup, turn off the heat or keep it at a simmer to keep the soup warm. Pour the soup into a bowl and garnish with Parmesan cheese if you wish. Enjoy your soup while it’s hot!

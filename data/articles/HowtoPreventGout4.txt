 If lifestyle changes are not enough to prevent your gout, a doctor may prescribe allopurinol or another medication. Always follow the instructions carefully, as taking too much medication or medication at the wrong time can have the opposite effect, making a gout episode worse.
 Recent evidence suggests that lead poisoning, even in levels too low to cause other problems, may cause or worsen gout.Although more studies are needed to confirm this, it may be a good idea to ask a doctor to test your hair or blood for toxins. This is especially true if you have lived or worked in an old building, use lead-based paint regularly, or work in an industrial setting where lead is used.
 These medications are sometimes used to treat other health issues, or as a dieting supplement. While their effect on gout is controversial, it is possible they worsen the condition.Ask your doctor if any other medications you take are diuretics, and if so, whether a potassium supplement is recommended to counteract this.

 This method uses techniques derived from origami, the Japanese art of paper-folding, to get perfect third folds.Though origami is usually done with square sheets of paper, this method should also work with standard 8 1/2 × 11 inch paper like you'd find in an office. Start by folding your paper in half in the same direction you'd like to fold it into thirds.










Note: If you don't want to make extra folds in your paper, you can find the midpoint of the paper and carefully mark a line across to divide the paper in half. If you do this, however, your line will need to be extremely straight to match the accuracy of a simple half-fold.
 Position your paper so that the half fold you just made goes from left to right. Use a straight edge to carefully draw a line from the bottom left to the point where the fold in the middle meets the right edge of the paper.









You can also do this method with a line that extends from the bottom right corner if you reverse all of the directions after this, but for convenience's sake we've decided to just give a single set of directions.
 Use your straight edge to carefully draw a line from the very top left corner of the paper to the bottom right. This line should intersect your middle fold at its center and your first line somewhere on the right side of the page.
 The spot where your two lines intersect marks one of the third folds you need to make. Use a straight edge to draw a line that passes through this point and also intersects both edges of the paper at 90 degree angles.










Carefully fold and crease along this edge. The folded edge should divide the rest of the paper into halves — if it doesn't, you may need to make minor adjustments at this point so that it does.
 Finally, take the non-folded edge of the paper and tuck it underneath the folded edge. Make a second crease when it is snug against the inside of your first crease. Your paper should now be divided into thirds.

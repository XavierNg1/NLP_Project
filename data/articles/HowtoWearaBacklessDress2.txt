 A few weeks before you plan on wearing your dress, use a loofah and a standard shower gel to gently scrub away dead skin every few days. Do not do this every day, however, since too much scrubbing may cause damage to sensitive skin.
 Even if you are not prone to back acne, regularly washing your back with an acne scrub is a good way to ward off stray pimples and keep your skin looking smooth.
 After you wash, apply a light moisturizer or lotion over your back to keep the skin from drying out.
 Tanned skin accentuates the muscles in your back, which may make you look more toned. A light coat is all you need to achieve the desired effect.

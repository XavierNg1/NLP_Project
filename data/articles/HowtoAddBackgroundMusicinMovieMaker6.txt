 If you wish to mute the audio track on a video file so that only the background music can be heard, click the small plus sign, located near the far left end of the Video editing timeline next to the word "Video." The editing timeline for the video file's audio track will open directly beneath the Video editing timeline.


Notice that there are now 2 audio editing timelines (4 total timelines) visible in the application window. Right-click the audio file on top, the one directly beneath the imported video clip, and select "Mute" from the menu options available. The audio editing timeline for the Video clip has been expanded and is visible in the application window.
 To adjust the volume, right-click the file and choose "Volume" from the menu options. A dialogue box will open. Move the slider to the right or left to adjust the volume and click OK. The volume for the audio track accompanying the video file has been adjusted.

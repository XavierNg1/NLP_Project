 As a parent, you may accidentally project your interests onto your child. This can lead to pushing your child into an activity that they have little interest in. Instead, consider your child’s interests when discussing possible activities., Though you may direct your child toward activities that you think would be a good fit, you should leave the final choice up to them. This gives them a sense of control and responsibility. It also makes them more accountable to what they have chosen.When your children are too young to know what activities are available, present them with a few activities to choose from.
 If at all possible, avoid jumping into a new season without first trying the activity. Take a few sessions to start out, or attend a day camp centered around the activity. This way, your child has the opportunity to change their mind about the activity without having to quit it., By framing each new activity as trying something new, you give your child permission to form their own opinion of it. If they try it and like it, they can continue the activity. If they don’t like the activity, they can move on to the next one.For example, if your child wants a pet and promises to care for it, you could consider allowing them to dog sit for a neighbor or friend. If they change their mind about caring for a pet, you aren’t stuck with the pet. If they don’t, there’s a better chance that they will stick with caring for their own pet.

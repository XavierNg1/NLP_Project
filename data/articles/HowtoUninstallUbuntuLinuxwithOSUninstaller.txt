 When it asks, choose "Try Ubuntu";
, After you have successfully launched Ubuntu, you have to open the terminal. There are two ways to do this. One way is to press (Ctrl + Alt + T) and the other is to click on the Dash Home button (or hit the Windows logo key on your keyboard) and search for "Terminal".
 To do this type :



sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair



and press enter. After this type :



sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install -y os-uninstaller && os-uninstaller



and press enter.
 Click on the dash home button and search for "OS-Uninstaller".
 In this case it is Ubuntu.

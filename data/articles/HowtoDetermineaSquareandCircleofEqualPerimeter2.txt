 The formula is 2π(r){\displaystyle 2\pi (r)}, where r{\displaystyle r} equals the length of the radius.The radius is the measurement between the center of a circle and its edge.;
, This information should be given, or you should be able to measure the radius. If you do not know the length of the radius, you cannot use this method.

For example, the circumference of a circle with a radius of 4cm is shown by 2π4{\displaystyle 2\pi 4}cm.
 To do this, multiply the three values together. If you are not using a calculator, substitute 3.14 for the value of π{\displaystyle \pi }.

For example, 2×3.14×4=25.12{\displaystyle 2\times 3.14\times 4=25.12}. So the circumference, or perimeter, of the circle is 25.12cm.
 The formula is P=4s{\displaystyle P=4s}, where P{\displaystyle P} equals the perimeter of the square and s{\displaystyle s} equals the side length of the square., You are substituting the circumference for P{\displaystyle P}, since the circumference of the circle and the perimeter of the square are supposed to be equal.

For example, 25.12=4s{\displaystyle 25.12=4s}.
 To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 4. This will give you the side length of the square.

For example:25.12=4s{\displaystyle 25.12=4s}25.124=4s4{\displaystyle {\frac {25.12}{4}}={\frac {4s}{4}}}6.28=s{\displaystyle 6.28=s}.So the circumference of a circle with a radius of 4 cm is equal to the perimeter of a square with side lengths of 6.28cm.

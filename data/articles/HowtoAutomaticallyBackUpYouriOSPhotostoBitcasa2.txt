 Locate the Bitcasa app on your iOS device. It’s the icon with a green background and a house on a cloud drawing. Tap on it to launch it.


If you don’t have the Bitcasa app yet, you can download it from your App Store. Launch the App Store, search for Bitcasa using the search bar, and once the results appear, tap on the app. Tap “Install” to download the app to your device.
 If you’re already logged in, you may skip this step. Otherwise, tap the “Log In” button found at the bottom of the screen. You will be brought to the login screen. Enter your Bitcasa email address and password then tap the “Log In” button.
 Bitcasa’s main screen gives you easy access to major categories of your files. This is the default landing screen. You can also reach this by tapping on the house icon from the left panel menu.
 It appears like an ad banner, but it’s actually an app option. On the far-right side of this is an “Enable” link; tap on this to turn on the Automatic Camera Backup function of Bitcasa.


All new photos or videos moving forward will automatically be uploaded to the cloud.
 After enabling Automatic Camera Backup, you will be asked if you’d like to upload your existing camera roll. Tap the “Yes” button if you’d like Bitcasa to upload all your existing photos and videos on your iOS device. Otherwise, tap the “No” button.


If you chose “Yes,” all your existing photos and videos will start uploading to the cloud.

 If you'd like perfectly-round ice balls or you simply don't want to deal with the hassle of filling and popping water balloons, investing in a good ice ball mold is your best bet. These are available in specialty stores and online for typically about $8-$20.Several types of molds are available, including:


Silicone molds: Made from flexible silicone material, which makes it easy to "pop" the frozen balls into drinks.
Screw-together molds: Made from hard plastic, but screw construction eliminates much of the danger of spillage.
Novelty molds: Usually designed to make the ice take the shape of a specific spherical object, like a baseball, the Death Star, etc.
 Regardless of the type of mold you're using, most work in the same way. Secure the top half of the mold to the bottom half, then position the small hole in the top half of the mold underneath a running faucet. Fill until the mold is full, then remove the mold from the water.


Some molds may come with caps for the filling hole — if this is so, secure the cap before freezing.
 Next, simply place your mold in the freezer and wait until the balls freeze all the way through. Depending on the size of the balls in your mold, this can take anywhere from one hour to six or so. When the balls are frozen, remove from the freezer, take the mold apart, and serve.


Be wary if you are using a silicone mold — some models may not be sturdy enough to retain their shape unless you put them on a flat surface.

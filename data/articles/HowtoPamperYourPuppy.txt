 Do you want a clean puppy, happy puppy, or what? You choose! I want a satisfied pup, myself!;
, They are listed below!

, Go to the place where your dog will be bathed. For a bathroom, shut down the toilet so its surface can hold your basket. Lay a lot of towels down because your dog will shake! Open the curtain, and turn on the water. Fill it up about four inches, with room temperature water.
 Go to your dog. Take off its collar, and brush its coat gently backwards to loosen up any waste, loose fur, and bugs.
 Put him in, and get him calmed down and used to the water.
 Cup water all over your dog until he is soaked all over. Dab the face with a wet cloth.
 Choose a suitable shampoo. Whitening, flea, and sensitive skin are popular choices. Rub the coat in with one or more shampoos. Lather from neck to tail, and rinse. Add conditioner for a better skin.
 As the water is draining towel down your dog as much as possible in the tub.
 Dab the dog with a towel, pat it down, and rub him dry. Now, set your dryer to low and brush the hair backwards while drying until 80% dry so the skin won't dry out.
, Do so gently, and loosely until about two hours later when he is completely dry.
 Spritz your dog with some puppy cologne for a fresh scent! Give a breath mint as well. Make sure it is for dogs though!

, This removes any extra plaque, and germs. If you have puppy toothpaste, use that!

, The eyes should be mostly clean with the exception of boogies and tear streaks. Use a Q-tip gently on the ears.
 Paint them as well if you want!

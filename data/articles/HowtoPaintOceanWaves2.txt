 If you are painting a crashing storm or a surfer's dream wave, look at similar photographs and paintings before you get started. Look closely to get a sense of the shapes waves form, and how the colors vary in different areas.
 The trough of a wave tends to be darker than the crest. A great way to improve your coloring and practice blending techniques is to use pastels. These are easy to control and do not soak or tear the paper as you blend. Make a pastel painting using the following technique, either for its own sake or in preparation for your favorite medium:


Sketch an outline of the largest wave in light blue, and a few smaller surrounding waves.
Color the lowest third of the waves a slightly darker blue, using strokes in the direction of the wave.
Return to your lighter color and use the same technique to color the next third of the waves.
Tip the waves with white, adding curves and bubbling shapes to represent foam.
Blend the three layers together until it looks natural.
 Some artists paint waves with long, sweeping motions of the paintbrush, while others paint in smaller stages. Also experiment with sponges, brayers, and any other tools you have in your studio.
 If you want the water to be translucent, thin out the paint. To add depth to shadowed areas, use thicker layers of paint.

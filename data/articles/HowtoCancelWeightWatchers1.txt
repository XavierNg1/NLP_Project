 Canceling your Weight Watchers membership online is the quickest and easiest method. You can cancel online services by filling out the cancellation form found under the "help" section on the Weight Watchers website.


While you can also email your cancellation form, or call 800-651-6000 to request your eTools access be cancelled, this online method will save you the most time.
However, you should note that your cancellation request can take up to 2 weeks to process.;
, To save you time and make cancelling as painless as possible, login first as you’ll have to login into your account before you can begin the process.


From the homepage of the Weight Watchers website you can find the login button in the upper right hand corner of your screen.
Follow the prompts to login by entering your username and password.
 Click the link that takes you to your profile page. Here you will see several options, find the box that says “Cancel my account”.


You may be brought to a page that gives you alternative options to cancelling. Just scroll down the page until you see the “Complete cancellation” button and click it.
 You may be asked to fill in your member number, name, email, and other information so that the customer service department can find your profile.


Fill out all the necessary information to complete the cancellation form.
Once you have completed the form look for a notification detailing your Weight Watchers cancellation. You should also receive an email shortly confirming you have cancelled.

Weight Watchers will refund you for any full, unused weeks that were prepaid on your monthly pass.

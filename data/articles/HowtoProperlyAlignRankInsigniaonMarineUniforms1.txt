 Enlisted marines are required to wear different uniforms, depending on the occasion. Generally speaking, there are three “types” of uniforms worn by enlisted marines. The field, utility or combat uniform is worn during active operations. The dress or blue dress uniforms are worn to formal occasions. Finally, the service uniforms are worn much like business suits, for military inquiries, appearances in court, meetings with officers, etc., Chevrons, which signify an enlisted marine’s rank, are worn on the sleeves and collars of all dress and service uniforms. While wearing utility or combat uniforms, enlisted marines only wear small, black chevrons that pin to the collars of their uniforms.The sleeve chevrons are stitched to the dress and service uniforms, so this article will deal exclusively with how to attach collar chevrons.
 An enlisted marine’s chevrons should always be positioned with the tip pointed up. Chevrons come in different sizes, depending on the rank of the marine, but are always placed on the collar with the points up., The bottom edge of the insignia (no matter what rank) will be 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from the side of the collar on both sides. Thus, a sergeant major's chevrons will protrude higher up than a PFC, because it is much taller., Chevrons for enlisted persons attach to the collar with a built in pin. Remove the backing from the pin, push the pin through the front of the cloth on the collar, and reattach the backing on the underside of the collar.

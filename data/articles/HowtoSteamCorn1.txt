 Pull the husks off of the corn as well as any threads or strings. Rinse the corn off in cool water, then cut off any bad spots. If you'd like, you can cut the cobs in half to make smaller portions.;
, You will need 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water. You can cook quite a large amount of corn using this method, especially if you stand the corn upright.
 The water should not touch the bottom of the steamer basket. If it does, pour some water out, but try to keep it as close to 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) as possible. Keep in mind that you may have to refill the water as the corn steams.
 If you are inserting the corn vertically, make sure that the stems are pointing downwards. If the corn is too big for the pot, cut the corn in half., If you like your corn more crisp, check it after about 4 minutes. The corn is ready when the kernels turn bright yellow.


Keep an eye on the water; don't let it fall below 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). You will be more likely to scorch your pot this way.
 Be careful when taking the lid off the pot.; the steam will be very hot.
 At this point, you can garnish the corn with some salt, pepper, and butter.

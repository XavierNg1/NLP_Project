, Your Majesty or May it please Your Majesty are the preferred terms. While it may be more appropriate to address Her Majesty’s Private Secretary or Lady-in-Waiting, you can nonetheless direct the correspondence to The Queen.


The Royal family also accepts the less formal Madam substitution.If your correspondence is with an aide, abide by the following rules:

The first reference should be Her Majesty The Queen

All other instances should be The Queen

Third person pronouns should be replaced with Her Majesty, While Her Majesty does have an email address, it's not exactly public.There would no doubt be a flood of emails if it were. If you'd like to shoot a quick message, however, the official Twitter account for the Royal family is https://twitter.com/RoyalFamily (@RoyalFamily). It appears Her Majesty uses it instead of her now defunct individual account., The Queen receives a large amount of mail, and it’s courteous to consider the volume of mail Her Majesty receives.It would not be inappropriate to ask for an answer or a reply, even if one is not likely.Do not expect a reply from Her Majesty. If you are lucky enough to receive a reply, it will be signed by the Lady-in-Waiting or The Queen's official writers.

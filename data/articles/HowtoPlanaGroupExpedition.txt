 This is a couple of sentences that clearly describe where you are going on the trip,why you are going, and what you want to achieve. Here is a sample mission statement: "I plan to lead my team through the Atlas mountains in Morocco. We will observe the hill tribes living there, and take some fantastic photos of the people and the landscape.";
, Work out how far your team will travel each day and plan where you will camp each night. Plan at least one alternative route both there and back in case you come across any obstacles in your journey.
 Read and compare the accounts of at least three different people.
 Investigate the type of weather you can expect in the area at that time of year, as this will affect the clothing and camping equipment you will need to take.
 Is the terrain flat or mountainous? Do you need to take ropes and climbing gear, or would it be wiser to take cross-country skis?

, How many days will you need to travel before you reach them? This will affect your calculations of how many days' food and drink rations you need to carry at the beginning of your journey. Remember that a lot of water is not potable(safe to drink) so you may have to take water purification equipment, Iodine crystals whilst not the nicest tasting, is one of the quickest, easiest and lightest per litre of water purified.
 This will influence the medical supplies you pack., What if someone gets sick from food poisoning or breaks a leg? Make a list of the supplies and equipment you'll need to deal with each situation.
 These duties might include map reading, shelter building, monitoring rations, fetching water, cooking, gathering wood and building fires, keeping the camp clean, and watching out for dangerous animals.
 Give a copy of the plan to everyone who will be going on the expedition. Leave a copy with someone who is not. This person can alert the authorities if you don't return on time.

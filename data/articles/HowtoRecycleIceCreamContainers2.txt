 Since paper containers are unlikely to be recycled, determine whether they can be composted instead. Check the packaging for the labels “biodegradable,” “compostable,” or “degradable.”Do the same with plastic containers if your community does not recycle them.


Plastic containers marked as “#7” and/or “PLA” may be accepted by composters. These plastics are created from plant-based materials, so they are biodegradable., First, check with your local government to find out if they offer a program themselves in addition to conventional recycling. However, expect this to be unlikely, since fewer municipalities offer both. In that case, see if your government can refer you to a privately-run composter, or perform your own search online..

Composting paper products at home is debatable. Although some people adopt the practice, others advise against it due to the inks used on the packaging, which may contaminate your compost and soil. Also, paper contributes very little nutrition to the compost, which means ice cream containers would just waste space in a small-scale compost pile., Visit their website or contact them directly. Find out if they accept your container. If it includes any features made from other materials (such as plastic or metal), be sure to mention it to find out if it is still acceptable.


If they do accept it, find out how to go about giving them your compostable materials. If it is a government-run program, they may offer curbside pickup.Other programs may require you to drop the materials off at select locations on select dates.

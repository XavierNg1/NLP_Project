Cut the cardoon hearts into chunks or wedges.
Cut the cardoon stalks into short lengths.
 Add the chopped cardoons to boiling salted water. Blanch for 5 minutes, then simmer.


If you want puréed cardoons, place the boiled pieces into a blender or processor and purée them.
 Melt butter in a heavy based frying pan or skillet. Add the chopped cardoons and gently fry for a few minutes until the stalks and chunks turn tender.


Cardoon pieces that have been blanched and battered can also be fried. This is a treat in New Orleans.
 Simply cut into small salad size pieces and sprinkle into a vegetable salad.
 Blanch the cardoons as above. Make a cheese or white sauce. Lay the cardoons in an ovenproof dish, and then cover with the sauce. Top with grated cheese of your choice. Bake in the oven until the top browns.


A thickened tomato-based sauce will also match well with cardoons, to make a stew-like dish.
 Use a favorite vegetable stew base and add cardoons to it.

 Use approximately one part bleach for every six parts water to achieve the right concentration. Shake the bottle to make sure the ammonia solution is properly mixed. Keep the spray bottle pointed away from your face at all times.Caution should be observed when handling bleach. It will be a good idea to wear gloves, a facemask and eye protection to defend against potential splatters.Dense buildup caused by moss or mold growth are typically resistant to gentler cleaning methods and will require a more intensive strategy.
 Apply the mixture liberally to the areas of the wall where moss or mold growth is the thickest. Bleach is a potent disinfectant and is mildly caustic—not only will it kill whatever is growing on the brick, it will also eat away at its hold on the wall.Test the bleach solution on an out-of-the-way spot on the wall to confirm that it won’t ruin the appearance of your brick.
Wet the wall down thoroughly before misting it with bleach. This will prevent the bleach from soaking into the brick, where it can create structural weakness.Be careful to avoid inhaling fumes or contacting bleach with your bare skin.
 For best results, give the bleach 8-12 hours to take effect. As it sits on the wall, it will choke the growth of moss or mold and make it easier to remove without the need for a lot of tedious scrubbing.The longer you allow the bleach to remain on the wall, the better job it will do of releasing sludgy grime.
 Once it’s been treated with bleach, the moss and mold should simply rinse off under a forceful stream of water. Pick off any remaining bits by hand using a plastic spatula or scraper, then rinse again. Allow the wall to dry and apply a silane-based sealant to safeguard against future growth if desired.Dust and spray your brick wall regularly after deep-cleaning it with bleach to keep moss and mold from returning.

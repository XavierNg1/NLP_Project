 At the start of the second trial in the game on Akala Island, you will receive the way to surf in this game from Lana, the trial captain. You cannot access it until this point. You have to complete the trial to get the fishing rod, so this cannot be done until the trail is complete.;
, At this point in the game you will have already been there once, but if you don't remember, it's right below your house on Route 1.
 Go back and forth until a fishing spot (a small collection of rocks under the water) is bubbling/rippling and then press A to fish. Be sure to approach the rippling fishing spot slowly, or else it will stop rippling. Press A again whenever the line starts shaking.
 Lower Corsola's health until it's red. Be careful though, if you knock it out, you have to repeat the previous steps. Lowering Corsola's health into red will cause it to call for help. If Corsola uses a healing move instead, keep the health low.
 There is only a 20% chance it will spawn a Mareanie, so be patient. Eventually if you keep Corsola A's health low and attack and knock out all the Corsola it summons, you will get a Mareanie.
 Get it down to low health and throw either a Great, Ultra, or Net Ball at it for best chance. If it's night, also try Dusk Balls. You don't have to worry about finishing off Corsola the turn after Mareanie appears as Mareanie will attack it for you. Use that turn to lower its health. After it's in the red, throw your ball of choice.

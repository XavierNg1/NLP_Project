 If squirrels repeatedly get into your attic, they may be smelling something in there that attracts them. Clean out your attic and make it's sure of anything that could be appetizing.
 Squirrels can jump directly from the branches to your roof.
 If squirrels and other critters often enter your home, consider placing an animal guard on your chimney. These are often made of stainless steel mesh, so you don't have to remove them when you use your fireplace.
 If a squire does become trapped in your chimney or attic, make sure it has a way to get out. Hang a rope down through your chimney so it can climb back up to the roof. Open a window in the attic and lure it out with squirrel food.
 Home and garden stores sell traps made specifically to capture squirrels without harming them. Set it up in your attic, and when the squirrel is caught, take it outside and release it.
 You may not want to deal with loose squirrels in your attic and chimney on your own. Call animal control to come over and trap the squirrel for you.

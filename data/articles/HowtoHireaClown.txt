 You may find listings in the phone book or from booking firms or agents, or you may have to locate them yourself by scanning advertisements and asking friends.;
, Ask other friends who have hired a clown about how their performance was, and if the clown acted appropriately and was reasonably entertaining.
 Ask them about the typical age-group of the audience, length of the show and what a typical entertainment routine looks like.
 If the clown works through a bonded agency and has good references, this step may not be needed.
 You can do this over the phone or in person. However, talking in person will give you a chance to observe his behavior and manner of speaking. If anything about his demeanor makes you uncomfortable, or if you're not impressed by how he describes his performance, don't hire him. An entertainer should, after all, be entertaining. Also, since you're having this performer in your house, you need to feel safe. If you find anything about the call or interview off-putting, move on and hire a different clown.
 Find out if he puts on a good show! Ask detailed questions about his demeanor and performance.
 Negotiate if necessary and come to an agreement about payment.
 Popular entertainers are booked at least a month in advance - late summer and fall are the busiest.
 Be clear about your expectations and make sure you examine what promises the performer makes. Consider whether there are any extra fees, whether he is bringing all his own supplies, and what his cancellation policy is.
 After the event, provide feedback so other parents don't have to do the same legwork again. If it was a good show, offer to be a reference for the clown. If not, consider putting a detailed review on whatever sites he uses to advertise and gather customer feedback.

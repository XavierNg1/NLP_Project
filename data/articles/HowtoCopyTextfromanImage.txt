, Once you’re at the download page, a button with “Free” written on it at the corner of the extension’s description window should be there. Click on it to begin downloading the extension.
 The download progress should appear at the bottom of your Chrome browser. Wait for it to finish, and Chrome should automatically install it.
 It has to be opened in the browser for the extension to be able to read the text. When you’ve found an image, right-click on it.
 Click on the tab to see the full image.
 The cursor should turn into a text-selection cursor, or I-beam, when the text from the image can be highlighted.

Since the project is still in beta stage, it may not guarantee an accurate copy of the text. It also depends on the font of the text you want to copy. Sometimes, texts whose characters are too close together will not copy over accurately.

, The CD will almost always begin the installation process automatically. You'll see a new window open with the Quicken Installation Wizard, which has instructions to proceed.


If the Installation Wizard doesn't open on its own, do this:Click the Start button and select "Computer" or "My Computer". On Windows 8, you'll need to find the "This PC" icon on the right and click it.
Double click the button with the CD/DVD ROM drive.
If that didn't launch it, right click the icon and click "Explore". Double click Install.exe to launch the program.
 Click the bubble next to the "I accept..." option, then click the "Next" button to continue.
 The Installation Wizard's on-screen prompts do a good job of explaining what you need to do. You will need to:Pick a destination folder. This is the location in your computer where Quicken will install. Using the default location is recommended. Click "Next" to proceed.

Read the installation details. Click "Next" to proceed.

Wait for the installation to finish. When Quicken is installed, you'll see a window that says "Installation Complete". Click "Finish." Quicken will open automatically.
 The Quicken icon should appear on your desktop.



At this point, you may be asked to supply the administrator's username and password. If you don't know these pieces of information, you may need to talk to the person who owns the computer to continue.
 This will cause the Installation Wizard to launch automatically.
 The rest of the installation process for Quicken on Macs is basically the same as it is for PCs. Follow the prompts in the Quicken Installation Wizard, taking the time to read the directions and clicking "Next" to proceed through the steps. See above for more information.

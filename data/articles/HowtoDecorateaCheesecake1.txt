 It is best to decorate this cake just before you plan on serving it, so plan accordingly., Although not necessary, this will give the cheesecake extra flavor. It will also give the strawberries something to stick to., Use a paring knife to chop off the stems first, then to cut the strawberries into ⅛ to ¼-inch (0.32 to 0.64-centimeter) thick slices. Leave one strawberry whole for the center.You can also choose to leave the strawberries whole.
 Staring from the edge of the cake, arrange the strawberries side-by-side, with the pointy ends facing out. Keep setting down the strawberries in rings, overlapping each one slightly, until you reach the center of the cake. The strawberries will start to stand up as you reach the center, sort of like a flower. Place the remaining, whole strawberry in the center.

If you are using whole strawberries, place the strawberries stem-side down onto the cake. You won't be able to overlap them.
 Whip the heavy whipping cream using an electric mixer or handheld beater until it starts to thicken. Add the powdered sugar, and continue to mix it until it forms stiff peaks.You can also use a food processor fitted with whisks for this step.
 It's okay if the frosting overlaps the strawberries a little. If you have any frosting left over, consider piping more "starts" around the base of the cake., Stir together the cornstarch and water in a small saucepan using a whisk. Add the jelly and cook over medium-high heat until the jelly has dissolved and the mixture thickened. Be sure to stir continuously., If you want to give the glaze a more vibrant color, stir in some red food coloring. You can speed up the cooling process by placing the saucepan into an ice bath (a large pot or sink filled with ice) or by sticking it into the fridge., You can pour it just over the strawberries, or extend it past the frosting and let it spread down the sides of the cake.

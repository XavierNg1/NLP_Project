 Find the LOG button on your calculator. When you’re ready, type: (first number) LOG + (second number) LOG + (third number) LOG =. Do not neglect to type = or the number you see will be the log of the most recent number, not the total.


Ex. log 7 + log 9 + log 12 = 2.878521796…

, If you added the logs of three numbers, divide by three.


Ex. 2.878521796 / 3 = .959507265…

, On your calculator, press the 2nd function (usually yellow) and then LOG to activate the secondary function of the log button, or the antilog. This resulting value is the geometric mean.


Ex. antilog .959507265 = 9.109766916. Therefore, the geometric mean of 7, 9, and 12 is 9.11.

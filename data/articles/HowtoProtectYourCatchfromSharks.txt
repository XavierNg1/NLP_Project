 If the fish are away from you, and on a long leash, the sharks will take your catch.;
, Continually turn your head and look in all directions because a mask has limited peripheral vision.
 When jabbing at the shark, do not hurt it. Make your fish, appear to be, a part of you by holding them close to your body when the shark swims close.
 The shark just wants your catch and if you get bitten it will be because you were in the shark's way. Sharks do not normally feed on humans.
 Each person keeps an eye out in his area and they stay in the same area (they do not go in separate ways). Two or three people can defend against small sharks but barely so against big sharks. Big sharks, in the Pacific Ocean, are usually tiger sharks.
 Designate the least experienced spear fisherman to be the lookout for sharks, boats and other hazards. The lookout does not spearfish, stays on the surface and continually looks for any potential dangers.
 When a shark gets too aggressive, get out of the water and on the boat.

 It should be a bit smaller--around 6 inches.


Do not taper the edges like you did the side; it should stay in a rectangle shape.
 This is the inner side of your pocket.


Add a sticky band to the bottom. Take a 6 inch piece and put it half on, half off the bottom of your little square. Trim it to an angle.

Cut with the sticky side of the tape up. It's easier to cut and leaves less residue on your scissors.


Flip over and fold these edges in half onto each other. What you end up with should resemble an envelope, sticky sides on the edges.
 Place it as high or low as you please.


Secure the edges with extra duct tape. If you don't, the pocket will fall off eventually.

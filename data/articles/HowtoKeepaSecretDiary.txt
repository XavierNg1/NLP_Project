 90% of the time, people who want to keep a secret diary or journal, end up only writing about twice a month, or just give up at about May. If you can't bring yourself to keep a commitment, wait another year, then you will be older and more sensible.;
, You may want to buy one more notebook. Just in case you lost one.
 The boring, plain notebook will be your secret diary, and the fancy frilly one will be your decoy.
 Some diary keepers like to offer a prize to the person who found it. This makes it more likely for the person to return it. You may want tell a person you trust to keep it safe and not look at it.
 Say something like: "Today I got up, lived my day, and went to bed." Write it again and again, and soon people will get bored in reading it and give up.
 Or you can just buy a notebook that comes with a lock.
 Of course, this is a secret diary, and secrets should be interesting. Even if you can't spot an interesting part of a day straight away, there is always fun in even the most boring of days! Perhaps you want to complain about a strict teacher? Or maybe you want to write about your crush? It's up to you, but you will need to keep to your commitment.
 It's natural, and blank pages mean something too! They mean you were feeling very lazy on that day, or you really couldn't find anything interesting about that day (which is almost impossible, but is possible!) and there was no point in writing. If you have found you have seriously forgotten to write a lot, and missed about three months, don't try to write and catch up. If you do, you are not writing your true, present feelings and your diary will no longer be a true diary.
 This just shows you don't keep a diary so people won't go looking. If a teacher asks in class: 'Who keeps a diary?', don't raise your hand! Students will look round and will know who's diary to look for.
 If you are not enjoying your diary, carry on until the end of the year, but just don't do one next year! Simple as that!

The chocolate is going to have to go first, as it can quickly get out of hand if you aren't careful.
If you're playing on Android or iOS, you can reshuffle the board (without losing a life) by existing and reentering before you make your first move on the board.
Do this as many times as possible until you have the two matches necessary to remove the chocolate.;

Watch out for the teleporter, as it's going to make that center row with the frosting really tricky.
Try to make horizontal combos to take out these squares. Or better yet, a vertical combo. Just make sure to get it within the teleporter lines.
Wrapped candies can also do the trick.



After the middle of the board is dealt with, or if you have very few options, you should try to work the bottom of the board, mostly in vertical matches, to try to force cascading combos. This is your best bet.
Take advantage of special candies. If you get special candies, try to maneuver them into useful positions.
Candy bombs are obviously going to be your friend here.

 It is fairly normal for your ears to itch. The hundreds of little hairs on and in your ear can be tickled easily. If your ear itches constantly and scratching/rubbing doesn’t satiate your problem, you might have a fungal infection. This is the primary way that fungal ear infections present themselves., You’ll almost always experience ear pain in one ear — not both, because the fungal infection is local. Sometimes, sufferers describe this as “pressure” or “fullness.” The pain can be mild or severe. Pain usually intensifies the more you touch your ear., Fungal ear discharge is usually thick and can be clear, white, yellow, and sometimes bloody/foul-smelling. Do not confuse this with normal waxy build up. Take a Q-Tip and swab your ear (being careful not to insert the tip into your ear canal). There will be a normal level of waxy buildup, but if either the amount or color seems off, you may have a fungal infection in your ear., A fungal ear infection may present itself in the form of muffled speech/sounds, difficulty understanding words, and trouble hearing consonants. Sometimes, people recognize their hearing loss more by a change in behavior. Frustration brews as a result of one’s inability to hear, so said person withdraws from conversations and social settings.

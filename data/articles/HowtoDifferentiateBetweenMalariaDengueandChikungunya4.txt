 Dengue and chikungunya are commonly transmitted by the Aedes aegypti.However, malaria is transmitted by the anopheles mosquito.
 Malaria is caused by anopheles, which is a protozoan.


Dengue and Chikungunya are both viral infections.
The former is caused by the dengue virus, while the latter is caused by Alphavirus.
 Dengue has a shorter incubation period, usually ranging from 3 to 4 days.


Chikungunya will take around 1 week before its signs are obvious.
Malaria will take at least 2 weeks to show symptoms.
 The main differences between dengue and chikungunya lie in some of their signs and symptoms.


Most obviously, dengue is associated with low platelet count, high bleeding risk, and pain behind the eyes, whereas chikungunya does not exhibit these symptoms.
Both dengue and chikungunya display joint pain, however, chikungunyaâ€™s joint pain and inflammation are more intense and pronounced.
Malaria is best known for paroxysm, the cycle of chills/shivering, then fever/sweating. This cycle usually occurs every two days., Though signs and symptoms may serve as rough guidelines for diagnosis, laboratory and diagnostic exams are needed to confirm a specific disease.


Malaria is diagnosed via blood film.
Dengue and chikungunya are often diagnosed through ELISA.

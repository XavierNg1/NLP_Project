 Only iPads that support both Wi-Fi and Cellular signals will have SIM cards. The original iPad uses a Micro SIM card.
 The original iPad SIM port is located on the left side, about halfway down.
 Insert the straight end into the hole next to the SIM port. Remove your SIM card from the tray. Be sure to reinsert the tray if you are sending your iPad in for warranty service.

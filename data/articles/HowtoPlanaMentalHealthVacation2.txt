 Planning the trip can relax you, take your mind off of daily stressors, and help you find something to look forward to.


It does not matter if you wonâ€™t be able to actually take the vacation for a while. Planning a vacation can be an enjoyable experience.
Try setting aside a few hours one evening to plan your dream vacation, or even just to plan a short weekend getaway that you hope to take in the next few weeks.
 You may start to experience some of the mental health benefits of your trip in the days and weeks leading up to it. You may find that you are daydreaming about the trip and feeling more relaxed than usual. This is called a pre-vacation high.Try to make the most of your pre-vacation high by allowing yourself to daydream about the trip and get into vacation mode a day or two before you head off on your trip. This will maximize the mental health benefits of your trip.
 One of the things that can decrease the mental health benefits of a vacation is a heavy workload upon returning home. To avoid a sudden and dramatic rise in stress when you get back, try to find ways to decrease your workload when you return.For example, you might complete a few projects before you take off for your trip, or avoid scheduling anything too stressful for the first few days after you get back.

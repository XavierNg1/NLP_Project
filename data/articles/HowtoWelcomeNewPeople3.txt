 Make sure that you are giving your new guests some breathing room. Do not hold their hand or attempt to babysit them from the time they walk in until they leave. Be friendly and inviting and connect them with others but do not feel that it is your total responsibility to watch over them.Don’t try to make them stay if they have decided to go. Don’t try to sign them up for anything that they are not interested in.
Don’t make them talk, especially if they are shy.
 People can be off-put if they are given too much too soon. Though they can certainly volunteer for whatever they want, avoid assigning them any task during their first meeting.
 Though it can be easy to relegate yourself to your pre-established friend groups, avoid being clique-ish in general, but especially when new members are present. If you see others doing so, remind them that you have guests and encourage them to introduce themselves.

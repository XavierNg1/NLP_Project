 In part because of its high sweetness and mild flavor, light molasses is often the preferred option for baking needs. In particular, use molasses to make cookies softer and breads more crusty.Light molasses is also best when a marinade or sauce recipe calls for molasses.
In general, think of light molasses as a sweetening ingredient.;
, Especially mild molasses, often packaged as “cane syrup” is derived from the first boil of the sugar refining process. This initial boil produces molasses that is both the lightest in color, as well as the sweetest. As such, this is the molasses to use when using molasses as a sugar substitute or sweetener.Other names for light molasses include “Barbados”, “first”, “mild”, or “sweet” molasses.
 Sorghum is a plant similar to sugarcane, from which a syrup similar to molasses is made. This syrup is thick and amber in color. It can be used instead of molasses as an even more mildly flavored sweetener. Use the same amount of sorghum syrup to sub for molasses, but reduce the amount of sugar the recipe calls for, as sorghum is sweeter than molasses.Sorghum syrup is also rich in potassium, protein, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus.

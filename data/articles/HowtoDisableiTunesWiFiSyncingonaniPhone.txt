Connecting your phone to your computer usually will launch iTunes automatically. If it doesn’t, try reconnecting the device or launch iTunes manually.
If you are using Windows and do not already have iTunes, you can get it from https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/.



You may instead be prompted to ‘verify’ your device, in which case tap Allow on the iPhone.
 This will appear in the menu bar to the right of the Library page dropdown.
 This is at the top of the left sidebar.


This screen may appear by default when selecting the iPhone.
 This is in the ‘Options’ section.
 Your changes will save and your iPhone will no longer sync with iTunes over WiFi.


You can still sync normally using the Sync button on the Summary page when connecting your iPhone to your computer with USB.

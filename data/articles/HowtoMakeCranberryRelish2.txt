 For extra crunch in your cranberry relish, add about 1/2 cup of chopped nuts to the relish. Ensure that the nuts are toasted so they're especially crisp. Consider using chopped walnuts, pecans, or almonds.Raw, untoasted nuts may become soft or chewy the longer they're in the relish. If you use raw nuts, serve the relish immediately.
 Although cranberries are tangy on their own, other tangy flavors work well in the relish. For example, you could add about 3/4 of a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar or sherry vinegar to bring out the flavor. You could also try stirring in one of the following ingredients to taste:Orange liqueur
Pomegranate juice
Cognac

, While traditional cranberry relish usually has orange zest or juice, you can mix in other chopped fruits like pineapple, dried figs, grapes, apples, or raisins. If you'd like to keep the fruit large, add the chopped fruit after you've pureed the cranberry relish.If you're watching your sugar intake, you could use one cup of pitted dates in place of the sugar.
 You can easily adjust the flavors of the cranberry relish by adding some of your favorite ground spices. Start by adding just a little of the spice so you can gradually add more as you like. Stir in some of these spices:Ginger
Cinnamon
Clove
Nutmeg
Cardamom

 One container will be used to house the gas before the expansion. The second container will be empty and provide additional volume to facilitate the expansion. Use a valved hose or pipe to connect these containers., Check the valve between the containers to confirm that it is closed. Use a cylinder of compressed air to force air into the first container. Pressurize the container to slightly above atmospheric pressures (e.g. approximately 1.5 atm).Use a barometer to check the pressure.
 Ensure that the valve between the containers remains closed. Use a vacuum pump to evacuate gas from the second container. It will not be possible to remove all gas from the container, but you should make sure that the container is below atmospheric pressure (e.g. 0.1 atm).A barometer can be used to determine the negative pressure (vacuum).

 The area where you practice cartwheeling is very important. Picking the right spot will boost your confidence and make you feel safe.


Choose an area where the ground or floor is flat and clean. Good spots include grassy lawns and gymnasiums with mats on the floor or built-in soft surfaces.
Make sure the space has plenty of room to enter and exit a cartwheel (you will move more distance than you think).
Check that there is nothing in the way that you could bump into.
Remember to consider who else may be in the space. On the one hand, you may not want to practice in front of other people if you feel nervous. On the other hand, it might make you feel better about practicing cartwheels if you know that there are people around who could help you if you fall.
 These are: lunge, hands down, (upside-down) straddle, finish. Breaking down and spending some time working with each of these steps helps make the whole activity more manageable.


Get used to the opening motion of a cartwheel by standing in the first position. Put your leading foot forward and raise your hands above your head. You have successfully completed the first part of a cartwheel!
Rock back and forth to start feeling that momentum in your legs and torso. This momentum is what will propel you into the cartwheel.
Try the lean-in movement of the initial stage of a cartwheel in slow motion. This will help you build in muscle memories of the basic way you will push off with your legs and put your hands down on the ground.
 This is the scariest part because it's the part where you flip over your hands and are upside down for a split-second. However, remember that old adage "practice makes perfect." Well, it's true! Every time you do a cartwheel, the less scarier it will seem.
 It may not be the best cartwheel in the world at first, but over time you'll get stronger and more confident.

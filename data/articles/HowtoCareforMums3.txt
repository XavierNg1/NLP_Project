 Mounding the dirt will help to keep your plants from dying, even in the face of frost heaving (a constant freezing and thawing that can happen to plants in the winter.), If you have potted mums, move them to a well-lit but cool location. Remove any covering your might have put on the pot. Do not over water your potted plants, as this can lead to bacterial growth. Wait to water the plants until the soil has dried two to three inches deep. When you water your plants, fill the pots so that they overflow and water runs out of the hole in the bottom of the pot.

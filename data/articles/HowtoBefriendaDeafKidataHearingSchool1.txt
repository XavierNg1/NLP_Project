 When you first notice that there is a deaf kid in your school, ask other students about him or her. See if anybody knows the kid's name, whether he can read lips or communicate with hearing people. Also see if he has an interpreter. Find out what grade he is in and if he has any friends.;
, Learning sign language will take a long time, so start with the alphabet. This will allow you to fingerspell any words you don't know. This way, you can communicate with the deaf kid, even if it's slow. Also, learning a little bit of signing will not only make it easier for him, but make him feel better that somebody cares about him enough to learn a whole new language, just to say hello at the least.
 If you want to learn actual signs, try reading a sign language book, looking signs up online, or watching YouTube videos on sign language. You will be amazed at how many sign language tutorials are out there in the world. Be sure that you are learning ASL (American Sign Language), or whatever particular language the kid you want to befriend uses.

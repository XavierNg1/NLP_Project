 Try to find a stick that is approximately 2-feet long and push it into the ground just enough to secure it so it stands upright. It’s also important to choose a stick that is as straight as possible. Once it’s firmly in the ground, sit or crouch beside the stick so that its tip is at your eye level.If you can’t find a stick that is long enough, tent poles also work well.
 The stick should be approximately 3- to 4-feet long so that its tip stands above the tip of the first stick. From your seated or crouched position, use the tips of both sticks to line up on a bright star in the sky. You may need to move the sticks slightly to line up the star properlyYou’ll know that you have the sticks set up properly if you draw an imaginary line between your eye, the tops of the sticks, and the star.
 You need to give the star some time to “move”. Keep in mind that the star doesn’t actually move; the Earth rotates, which makes the star appear to have moved. The key is to be be patient -- it can take anywhere from 5 minutes to a half hour for you to notice the movement. The way that the star “moves” will help you figure out the direction in the Northern Hemisphere.If the star moves up, you are facing east.
If it moves down, you are facing west.
If it moves right, you are facing south.
If it moves left, you are facing north.
In some cases, the star may appear to move in two direction. For example, it might move up and to the right, which you mean that you’re facing southeast.

 A “grand mal” seizure, also called a “generalized tonic-clonic” seizure, is probably what you think of when you imagine a seizure. This type of seizure may cause a person to fall down, cry out, shake, or lose consciousness. If you encounter an individual having this type of seizure, the first thing you should do is help them lie down on the ground.Once they are on the floor, roll the individual onto one side of their body.
This will help them breathe.
 Move any furniture or other items away from the person as best you can. Pay particular attention to anything sharp, blunt, or hard. Give the person a wide circle around them to prevent an injury., Place a pillow, folded blanket, folded jacket, or anything soft under the person’s head. This will help to protect their head and neck from injury.You will also want to remove their glasses.
 If they are wearing a scarf, tie, or buttoned shirt loosen this clothing as best you can. Constrictive clothing around the neck may make it difficult for them to breathe., During a seizure, an individual can likely still hear and understand you. Speak calmly and try to comfort them. Let them know that the seizure will end is just a matter of minutes, and tell them that everything is OK.You might say, “It’s OK. I’m going to stay with you. We can watch the clock together. This is only going to last for a minute or two.”

, Anytime you encounter a person having a seizure, check right away for a medical bracelet. A bracelet may communicate an epilepsy diagnosis, or another health concern. You will need this information if you must contact emergency services.These are usually small metallic bracelets worn on the wrist.
A person may also have a medical tattoo that communicates this info.

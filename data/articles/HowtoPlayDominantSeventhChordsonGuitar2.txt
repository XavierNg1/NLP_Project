 Just as any barre chord on the 6th string is an E-form chord, anything starting on the 5th string is an "A-from barre chord." Again, the shapes all match open A chords, so if you simply barre two frets up from a basic open A7 you can get your barre chord shape anywhere. If you forget the A7, its a simple chord to remember:









--0--
--2--
--0--
--2--
--0--
--X--

, Wherever this barre starts is the root note. So, this note determines what chord you have -- start on a D, and you have a D7. Start the barre on the 5th string, 5th fret, for example, and you'll have a A-from D7 chord:









--5--
--5--
--5--
--5--
--5--
--X--

, This is identical to the start of an E-form chord. If you're barring for a D7 (5th fret), then you'll play the 7th fret on the 4th string.









--?--
--?--
--?--
--7--
--5--
--X--

, Skipping the 3rd string (it stays barred), use your pinky to play the note two frets from the barre on the B-string. The lowest string stays barred as well, meaning you've finished the chord. Again, remember that this shape is identical to an open A7, plus the barre. Your final D7 looks like this:









--5--
--7--
--5--
--7--
--5--
--X--

, Do not strum the top string of the note -- it is an extraneous, low E that will muddy up your sound. However, you now have the A-form dominant seventh chord shape down, and could move it anywhere on the fifth string to play the chord. Start on the 7th string for an E7, for example:









--7--
--9--
--7--
--9--
--7--
--X--

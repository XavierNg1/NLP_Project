 Don't worry about the spelling, just let your mind flow and write as much as you can. After one minute is done, carefully read everything written on your paper. Take the words and sentences that seem interesting to you and write about them and correct the spelling if wrong.
 Tape the sentences on places where you see and encounter them everyday. Places like on the mirrors, on your laptop's or computer's screen and on the fridge. After a week or two, gather all the sentences and make an interesting story out of them and add more things to them if you want.
 Once you start writing, you will also start falling in love with it. But sometimes, because of writer's block or other reasons, you just don't have the ability to write anymore. It's okay! Never force yourself to write and only write when you feel like it. Take breaks sometimes and after that, start writing again. Ideas will eventually come to you.

 When you present your cheeses, make sure that they are not too close together. Stronger smelling cheeses can overwhelm lighter cheeses. If you place your milder cheeses close to a stinky cheese, they all may end up tasting like the pungent cheese. Spreading out your cheeses also makes it easier for your guests to get to them.If you really want to give your cheeses some room, consider placing them on their own plate or platter.
 You should also avoid placing the cheeses in close proximity to the foods with which you have paired them. This will prevent stronger smelling items from overwhelming your lighter cheeses. Although it may be esthetically more pleasing to have everything clumped together, spreading things out will preserve the flavor of the cheese and prevent any traffic jams at the hors dâ€™oeuvres table.
 For your softer cheeses, make sure to give each cheese its own knife. This will prevent a cross-contamination of flavors. The same is true for your harder cheeses if you decide not to precut them.A butter knife will work well for softer cheeses. You may need a paring knife for harder cheeses.
 In order to help guide your guests, you may want to consider arranging your cheeses in a clockwise fashion from mildest to most pungent. You may also want to label the cheeses and briefly note their characteristics. Place the cheeses on a circular platter or a Lazy Susan to facilitate access and visibility.

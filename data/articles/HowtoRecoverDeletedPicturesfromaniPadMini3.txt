 Navigate to FoneLab's website, and download and install the software.


Launch the software, found in your applications folder, and proceed onto the next step.
 Plug your device into the USB port to allow FoneLab to scan it.


Click Start to begin the scanning process.
FoneLab will scan all of your device's contents, even if the screen is locked.
 Once the scanning is done, you can use the Recover menu to navigate through your deleted files files.


Click the switch labeled “Only display the deleted item(s)” to narrow your search to include only the deleted items.
Once you find the files you’re looking for, select them.
Specify a folder for FoneLab to copy your files to make it easier to work with the files once they’re retrieved.
Click the ‘…’ button next to the Output Folder field at the bottom of the screen, and choose a folder you’d like the files copied to.
 The recoverable files will be added to a folder on your computer, and you will be able to access them from there.

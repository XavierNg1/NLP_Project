 If your previous page has not disappeared within 5 seconds, do the first step.;
, Like most Windows you can't minimize from the top right corner while a page is loading. Always keep notepad or another window open, and click that page down at the bottom taskbar. See the task bar? Click another window from it, and it will minimize the current window, and bring up another window.
 The page should now be white, do this again. The page should start to load.
 Now click the refresh button twice. The page should start to load.
 Hopefully, you're past dial-up, and can reset your modem. Stop the process, and reset the modem, and load the page again.

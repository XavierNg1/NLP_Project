 If you have longer hair, use a hair tie to pull back your hair and secure it in a ponytail or bun.The swim cap may move your hair around so be sure your hair is tied up tight and high.
 Dip your head in the pool or run it underneath a shower before putting on your cap.Since the cap material tends to stick to and pull on dry hair, wetting your hair may make the cap easier to put on (although this will depend on the material of the cap).
 Ask a friend to help you put on your swim cap. Open up the swim cap with your hands, and tilt your head downward. Hold the front of the cap securely at your forehead while your friend takes the back of the swim cap and stretches it over to the back of your head., Once the cap is on your head, make any necessary adjustments. Pull the cap down further, adjust its positioning on your forehead, and tuck in any loose hairs.Remember that you can position the cap around your ears in whatever way is most comfortable for you. You can tuck your ears in, leave your ears out, or cover only a portion of your ears.

 Alcohol can damage bone marrow and impair platelet function.It also slows your body's production of new platelets.Heavy drinkers are particularly likely to experience a temporary drop in platelet count.;
, Low platelet count can be caused by exposure to toxic chemicals, such as pesticides, arsenic, or benzene, all of which slow platelet production.If your job requires you to work with chemicals such as these, take the necessary safety precautions., Some medications can cause a low platelet count. Even NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as aspirin, naproxen (Aleve) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can have an effect on your platelet count.NSAIDs may also thin your blood too much, which is a bigger problem if you are also having platelet issues.Do not stop taking any medication you have been prescribed without talking to your doctor first.


Blood thinners such as heparin are the most common causes of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia. This type occurs when the medication causes your body to produce too many antibodies, which destroy your platelets.Chemotherapy drugs and anti-seizure medications such as valproic acid may cause drug-induced non-immune thrombocytopenia. This type occurs when your medication keeps your bone marrow from producing enough platelets.Other medications that may interfere with platelet production include: furosemide, gold, penicillin, quinidine and quinine, ranitidine, sulfonamides, linezolid, and other antibiotics., Several viral diseases, such as mumps, measles, rubella, and chickenpox, can affect your platelet count.Getting vaccinated for these diseases can help preserve your health and avoid a low platelet count.You should also talk with your pediatrician about vaccinating your child. Most children are healthy enough for vaccination.

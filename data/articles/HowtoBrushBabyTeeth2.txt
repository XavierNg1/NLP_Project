 Clean gums with a soft wet gauze pad that has been wrapped around your finger. Gently wipe the gums with the gauze to help remove bacteria and clean the gums.
 You can do it more often if you prefer just make sure you do not overdo it. Excess cleansing can irritate babyâ€™s gums and result in sensitivity or tenderness of the gums.

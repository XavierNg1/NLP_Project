 This app looks like a map containing a white “G.";
, It’s on the left-hand side of the search bar. This will bring up the Google Maps menu.
 It’s about halfway down the menu, and has an icon that looks like a train. The map will now highlight bus, subway, and rail routes. Use the map to see which transit line(s) will take you closest to where you want to go. Then, tap a transit station icon along the line to get location and scheduling information, see pictures and reviews, and plan a trip.


Different colored lines represent different transit lines, and colors will vary depending on region and transit system.

 The best type of lid to work with is the kind that comes from a yogurt, butter, or margarine container. Make sure that the lid is clean and dry.
 Turn the lid over so that the inside is facing you. Fill the bottom with a thick layer of clear school glue.Make sure that there aren't any gaps or holes in the glue, or your suncatcher will fall apart.It may seem as though you are using more glue than necessary, but clear glue tends to shrink a lot as it dries.Do not use a clear, industrial-strength glue for this; you want to be able to remove the suncatcher from the lid when you are done.
White school glue may also be used, but your finished suncatcher may look cloudy and not sparkle as much., You can arrange them randomly or in a pattern, but make sure that you fill the entire bottom of the lid in an even layer. To make a more interesting looking suncatcher, experiment with different sizes and colors.Make sure that the flat size of the gems is facing down.
 Do not skimp on the glue during this step; this is what will hold your suncatcher together. Make sure that you fill all of the cracks between the gems, and don't worry if the glue covers the gems; the glue will dry clear., If it tends to get very dusty where you live, consider placing a cardboard box over the lid to keep the glue clean and dust-free.
 Turn the suncatcher over, so that the back is facing you, and let it finish drying., Find an area near the edge of the suncatcher where the glue is thick. Thread some clear string through a needle, then push the needle through the glue.Tie the ends of the string into a loop.
 You can hang the suncatcher from a suction cup that has a hook on it, or you can hang it from the window latch.Do not let this suncatcher get wet. The glue will dissolve.

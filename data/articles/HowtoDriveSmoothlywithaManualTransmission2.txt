 When your engine RPM starts to get above the normal range (about 2500-3000rpm commonly), you usually need to upshift.


Note that when you need to accelerate quickly or climb a hill, you should usually let the engine rev higher than when accelerating on a level surface or you'll 'lug' the engine which will lead to ignition timing problems.
 Make sure that clutch is fully depressed before moving the shift lever or you may grind the gears.
, As with starting out, the clutch and throttle should be managed together to ensure a smooth shift, although generally when the car is already moving, you can release the clutch a little more quickly than when starting out.


Why? You will have better control of the vehicle if you're going round a corner.
When you change gear, you're pushing a selector fork against a rotating collar and you then push that collar into the gear you want to be in. If you hold the gear lever, you have a stationery object (the selector fork) that is being pushed against a spinning collar and you will wear out this selector fork due to the pressure being applied to it.

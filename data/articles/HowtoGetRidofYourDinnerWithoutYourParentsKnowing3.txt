 Go into a room where you know you won't get constantly checked up on.
 Make sure to put it somewhere that your parents/siblings don't go into often, such as a small cabinet or desk tray. Also make sure it doesn't give off a smell.
 This will reduce your chances of running into them.
 That way, Mom won't see it when she's taking out the trash.
 Find something else to snack on.

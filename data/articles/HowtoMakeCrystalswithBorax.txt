 You will need borax, a glass container, boiling water, pipe cleaners, a mason jar or small glass bowl, string, a spoon, a pencil, scissors, and food coloring if desired for color.
 Using the pipe cleaners, shape the pipe cleaners into any desired shape. You may want to shape it into the shape of a flower, heart, snowflake, or a star. Remember that this will be the base for your crystals so choose a shape you'd like., Cut a 10 inch (25 centimeters) piece of string using the scissors. Lay the pencil across the jar or bowl. Tie the pipe cleaner with the string and place it in the container. The pipe cleaner should be close to the bottom, but it should not touch the bottom of the container. , To help the pipe cleaner hang freely, tie the other end of string onto the pencil. When you have your string tied and ready, lift the pencil and the pipe cleaner out of the container. Set it aside., For every 1 cup of boiling water, dissolve 3 tablespoons of borax in a glass container. , Use oven mitts if needed as the mixture is boiling hot. It's normal for the borax to settle on the bottom. , For a vibrant color, add 10-15 drops of food coloring. For a lighter color, add about 7-10 drops of food coloring. Stir around with a spoon until the mixture is bright and vibrant.,, After the container sits overnight, the crystals will appear on the base. Mixing the boiling water and borax creates a suspension of solid particles. When solution starts to cool, the water molecules slow down and move closer together. The molecules bond together and form crack and then start crystallizing.

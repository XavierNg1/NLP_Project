 When you need to change the written form of a number to its standard form, you need to take the written words and change them into their numerical equivalents.Example: Rewrite "seven thousand four hundred thirty eight" in standard form.

In this example, "seven thousand four hundred thirty eight" is provided in written form (a.k.a. its "word name"). Change it so that it will be in numerical form.

;
, Take another look at the number in your problem. Separate out each different place value and write the place values separately in numerical form, separated by plus signs.


Note that the form you will produce in this step is actually known as a value's "expanded form."
As you get comfortable with the process, you might be able to skip this step and move directly onto the next one.

Example: In this problem, the separate place values are: "seven thousand," "four hundred," "thirty," and "eight."

"Seven thousand" = 7000
"Four hundred" = 400
"Thirty" = 30
"Eight" = 8
In expanded form, the value is: 7000 + 400 + 30 + 8



, To find the standard form of your number, you simply need to add together all of the different place value pieces.



Example: 7000 + 400 + 30 + 8 = 7438

, You should now have your final answer and the standard form of your number.



Example: The standard form of "seven thousand four hundred thirty eight" is 7438.

 If she feels like you really appreciate her buying you toys, she will be more likely to get you another one. Make sure you mean it when you tell her “thank you” so she believes you.Do this on a regular basis for several days instead of thanking her for everything all at once.
 Be responsible and kind with the toys you already have. Show your mom that you will be nice and allow others to use your toy so it benefits everyone if she buys it for you.She wants to know that you will keep playing with the toy once she buys it, so it doesn't seem like a waste of money. Playing with the toys you already have is a good step toward proving a new toy is worth the money.
If you have siblings and share your toys, buying a toy for you is also like buying a toy for your brother or sister, which makes it more valuable.
 You are going to want her to be in a good mood when you ask her for the toy. Be on your best behavior so that she is more likely to reward you with the toy that you want.


Think of all of the things she has asked you to do in the past and do them without her having to ask.
Work hard on your school work and finish your homework quickly to show that you have time to play with toys.
Complete all of your chores and offer to do more to help your mom.

 You can use a lightweight hardware listing program that is included in many Linux distributions. If you don't have it, it can be easily installed. You can quickly open the terminal in most distributions by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
 Many Linux distributions, including Ubuntu and Mint, include lshw. Use one of the following commands to install lshw. If you already have it, you'll be informed that it's already installed.Debian - sudo apt-get install lshw

Red Hat/Fedora - sudo yum install lshw


, Use the following command to cut out most of the clutter and display the items that most people are looking for:



sudo lshw -short., Use the "Class" column to find the item you want. You can find the processor, the memory (RAM), the graphics card ("display"), and disk volumes.
 This can be useful if someone is helping you troubleshoot, or you want to sell the computer.


Type sudo lshw -short > specs.txt. You can rename the file to whatever you'd like. You'll find the text file in your /home folder.
You can also type sudo lshw -html > specs.html. This will create an HTML file that may be easier to read when opened in a web browser.
 This will allow you to view your hardware in a graphical window that you can navigate through. This can be more comfortable for users coming from Windows or OS X.


Type sudo apt-get install lshw-gtk (Debian) or sudo yum install lshw-gui (RH/Fedora).
Type sudo lshw -X to launch the GUI for lshw. The GUI uses the "3-frame" layout. When you expand something in the left frame, the sub sections will appear in the frame to the right. Expand the different categories to find your specs.

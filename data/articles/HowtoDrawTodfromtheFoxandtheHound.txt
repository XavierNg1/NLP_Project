 Draw three rounded triangles. Make a larger rounded triangle for his head and then two smaller ones for his ears (as shown).

Donâ€™t forget to draw vertical and horizontal lines as guides. These will be helpful later when you draw his face.



 

;
, Use a curved line as a guide. After you do that, draw a peanut shape to give added weight to his main body.
 Don't finish his legs at this point (that will come later). At this point we're simply constructing the character's separate physical dimensions.
 Sketch some squiggly lines for the spots on his tail and legs.
, Add his eyes, button nose, lines on his ears, and a little bit of hair on top of his head.
 You can use a black pen or marker on your drawing. Or, if you'd like, you can use a paint brush. Erase all your pencil marks to make everything nice and neat. Note: make sure to erase everything, even the guidelines.
 Tod is a red fox, so you really only need three colors: red/orange, brown, and cream/white. Use shading and gradation as you wish.

 Remove all furniture from the room or area and any rugs. Be sure to sand every part of the floor that is to be marbled.;
, Apply across the entire floorspace.
 Measure exact squares across the entire floor space using a measuring tape and pencil. Draw over the lines using a felt tip pen so that you can see the borders of each square easily when painting. Leave a general border space of 20 centimeter (7.9Â in); this will "frame" the entire floor feature.
 Start by painting the light or white coloured squares using off-white white paint.
 While each off-white square is still wet, create small brush streaks using a combination of black, tan and grey. Use a dry brush to blur in the streaks.
 Once dry, use masking tape and paper to protect them from the next step, painting the the dark colour. Cover each light square completely in paper and be sure to make the masking tape meet the edges exactly. It takes a bit of work but it is worth doing well.
 This paint should not be brushed on, as you want it to appear streaked. Hence, some of the base colour should also show through. The only brush strokes should be fine ones to soften the look as the paint is still wet.
 This will create patchy streaks on the dark paint of the squares. Leave the dark squares to dry.
 Paint entirely in black paint. While it is still wet, use a paint cloth to wipe turpentine in it here and there, to create a mottled effect. Don't do all of the border, just parts to give the effect of old marbling.
 Only do this part once the paint has dried.
 Seal the floor with five thin coats of a low-gloss polyurethane varnish. Allow each layer to dry before adding the next.
 Stand back and admire your work; it should appear as a marbled black and white checkered floor!

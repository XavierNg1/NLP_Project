 As with washing, drying flannel sheets with too high a temperature may lead to shrinkage and pilling. To prevent this, always select the lowest available heat setting, or simply let your sheets tumble dry. It will take longer, but it will be worth it to preserve the comfortable feel of your bedding.Give yourself plenty of time to get your laundry taken care of so you won’t have to worry about soggy sheets at bedtime.
 If space permits, you might also choose to dry your flannel sheets by hanging them up. After removing the sheets from the washer and wringing out any excess water, stretch out the sheets to expose as much surface area as possible and hang them on a clothesline or drying rack.Save money on your energy bill by getting the sheets started in the dryer, then letting them finish air drying.
If it’s a nice day, you can speed up the drying process by placing the damp sheets in direct sunlight. Not only will the warmth of the sun help them dry faster, sunlight also makes a great natural disinfectant and deodorizer., Once your sheets are dry, you can put them right back on your bed, or neatly fold them and stash them in the linen closet until cold weather comes around again. Leaving them to sit in a pile makes them more susceptible to wrinkles.


Be sure to check your bedding for large pills, lint and loose threads.Give the sheets a good shake to fluff them up before making the bed.

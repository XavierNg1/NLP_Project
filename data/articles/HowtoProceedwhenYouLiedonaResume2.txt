 If you reach the interview stage and the hiring manager asks you about something in your resume that’s not true, resist the temptation to maintain the lie. Coming clean will make you feel better and show that you want to do the right thing.


Understand that you may no longer be considered for the job or, if you have the job, that you may be terminated.
 Expressing your deepest apologies for your actions may help you in this situation and may ease the feeling the employer will get from being lied to. You do not need to overly apologize. Just a simple, “I’m sorry for my actions” will do, so long as they are sincere words.
 Some potential employers may want an explanation so they can understand why you lied. Others may be angered and disappointed and not care about your reasons. In any event, keep your reasoning brief and to the point. Just a few words may help you to get your point across and stop the person from becoming more upset.
 You can simply say, “I am willing to accept the consequences for my actions”. Then, let them speak. While this is not the ideal outcome, it is something you will have to do if you still hope to get the job.
 It will do you no good to start arguing or defending yourself. Staying calm and listening to what the employer has to say will keep the situation from getting out of control.

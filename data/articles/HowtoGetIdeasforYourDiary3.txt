 A diary doesn’t have to be just for writing. You can also keep small reminders of things you do each day.


Keep things like ticket stubs to movies and concerts, notes from friends, and photographs.
Use cute washi tape or glue to secure these to pages in your diary. You can collage them all together, or add words in around them to remind yourself why you kept a certain ticket.
 In addition to writing in your diary, you might also want to add little sketches. Sketch the places you love to visit or hang out.Create portraits of your friends, draw your pets, or draw your favorite flowers.


If you’re new to sketching, start with a pencil, in case you want to change parts of your sketch as you go.Add color to your pencil sketch with pastels, paints, markers, pens, or colored pencils.
Don’t worry too much about whether or not your sketch looks good. Your diary is for you to look at and enjoy, and the creative process should be fun.If you have a polaroid, pictures from it are great to put in your diary.
 Stickers can be a creative way to record things in your diary. For example, you can use stickers to keep track of your emotions each day.


If you are feeling particularly happy one day, add a smiley face sticker next to that date.
On days that you especially want to remember, add a sticker so you can easily go back to read those entries.

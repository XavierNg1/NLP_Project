 Typically, the first sign of a problem is a drastic drop in attendance or engagement at school or work. Maybe you learn that your teen has been skipping school. Or, you are asked to repeatedly lie to your roommate’s boss about their “family emergency.” Sudden changes in their functioning suggest that something else, possibly drugs, has become a priority for the person., If your loved one has recently gotten into trouble with the law or other authority figures, take note—especially if this is out of character for the person. Also, pay attention to your loved one seemingly needing more money than usual. You might have to lend them money often or hear of others doing so.

Family members may have to bail abusers out of jail or get them out of trouble in other ways., Drug addiction and lying are like two peas in a pod. A person who is abusing drugs frantically tries to cover their tracks, but you’ll often notice gaps in their stories or excuses. For instance, maybe you believed your husband when he told you he’s been working late, except you bumped into his coworker who contradicted his story., A hot, then cold demeanor may be common in a person who is abusing drugs. You might notice your loved one suddenly becoming secretive and locking their bedroom door. They may stay out late. Or, you might catch them hiding things or acting suspiciously.

Other changes common to drug abuse include suddenly sleeping and eating too much or too little. In addition, your loved one may have trouble remembering things, seem paranoid or distrustful, speak differently (slurring), or act aggressively.

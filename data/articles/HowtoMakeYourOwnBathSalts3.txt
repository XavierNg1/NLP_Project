 You will need one cup of epsom salt, one cup of baking soda, two tablespoons of liquid glycerin, and essential oils. Adding dried herbs or flowers can also add extra scent and beauty to your bath salts.
 Start by mixing the epsom salt and baking soda together. Then, add the liquid glycerin and combine well. Use as much scented oil as you would like, but make sure that you thoroughly mix it with all of the ingredients.
 Pour all of the bath salt mixture into a container with a lid, and store it between uses. Add a few tablespoons to hot bathwater and enjoy the skin-softening effects!

 One of the best ways to get a free massage is to swap massages with a loved one. This will require both of you to learn proper massage techniques. Learning to massage each other will make massages available at home.


Giving each other a massage can be entertaining and enjoyable. You can buy books on how to give a great massage or you can borrow books from the library. You can also search on YouTube for massage techniques.
Buy products needed to make the massage as enjoyable as you possible can. Your purchases may include massage oils and scented candles. To avoid spending money, you can also just use lotions and oils that you have at home.
Create a relaxing atmosphere when conducting a massage. You can do this by dimming the lights and making sure the temperature is comfortable.;
, Identify a friend who is interested in exchanging massages. Not everyone feels comfortable being massaged by a friend, so be sure that they do not feel pressured.
 Convince others to barter a massage by saying that it can be relaxing. It can also increase flexibility, reduce pain, improve concentration, and provide more restful sleep., Licensed Massage Therapists are people too. They are just as likely to barter a massage as everyone else.


If they do not want a massage, find something else to barter. Consider artwork, babysitting, housecleaning, or landscaping.
 There was a time when massages were rarely, if ever, covered by health insurance. That is no longer the case. There are instances when a massage is covered, depending on the personâ€™s health condition. Some anxiety and stress related illnesses could benefit from a massage. Consider a chiropractic massage. This may increase the chances of being covered by health insurance or by an employee benefit plan. It never hurts to ask.

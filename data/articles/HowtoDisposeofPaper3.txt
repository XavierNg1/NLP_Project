 Newspapers and non-glossy paper make excellent compost material, especially in compost bins that have lots of kitchen type scraps. There are a few things to watch out for, but overall this is a great way to bulk up your compost.


Most ink is non-toxic these days, so don’t worry about that.The types of paper you should avoid using in your compost are: glossy/waxy paper, magazine paper, fluorescent colored papers, paper with metallic inks and colored construction paper.
 Composting with paper works best when shredded material is used because it breaks down more easily. Shredded material is also easier to mix into your compost pile.
 Stir it down into the compost heap so that it doesn’t get blown around by the wind.The dry material helps soak up the water content from the kitchen scraps and help oxygenate the pile.


If your compost heap contains kitchen scraps and yard trimmings, the shredded paper helps to bulk up the volume of soil. This means that once the composting process is complete, you will end up with more finished compost to go around.
Paper is almost completely carbon. A healthy compost thrives on a ratio of 25 parts carbon to 1 part nitrogen, so using shredded paper in your compost heap provides an excellent source of the carbon needed for a successful composting process.
Since a lot of paper equates to a lot of carbon, be sure to balance it with plenty of nitrogen (green stuff) and keep the compost damp.
Shredded paper may be used as bedding for worm composting, as well, if it's not glossy. Be sure to keep it moist.

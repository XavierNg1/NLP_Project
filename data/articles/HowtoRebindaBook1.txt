 Approximately half an inch (1 cm) from the spine of the book, use a utility knife to cut into the cover's book cloth on both the front and the back. Avoid cutting along the hinges, as these connect the cover to the text block. You can then take the bone folder and gently pry the spine off of the book.;
, Either measure the spine that you just removed, or measure the space between the hinges on your textblock. Cut a piece of cardboard or Bristol board to match this measurement.
 Select a sturdy piece of cotton or linen fabric that matches the current cover of your book. Measure it to equal the size of the spine, and then add an additional inch to the length and two inches to the width. Cut the fabric out in this shape.
 Cover the back of your spine with book binding glue, and center it over the book cloth. Cut the corners of the fabric off at 45 degree angles, and add glue to the bottom edge of the board. Fold the top and bottom of the book cloth over and press it into the spine.
 Using the utility knife, chip away as much of the old spine's glue as you can from the text block. You want the new spine to have a clean start, so make sure it sticks by properly preparing the space it will fit.
 Place the book with the spine edge facing up. Use bricks to hold it in place. Glue a spine liner paper to the pages of the book.
 Put glue on the exposed book cloth of the new spine. Carefully drape the new spine over the book. Starting from the spine, push the book cloth onto the cover. Use a bone folder to remove any air bubbles. Wrap the book cloth around the top and bottom of the original cover.
 Place the finished book into a book press overnight to dry. Place a piece of waxed paper inside the cover to prevent the pages from sticking.

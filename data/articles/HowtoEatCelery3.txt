 Celery soup is a warming autumn and winter dish that's easy to make and goes well with bread.


You'll need a head of celery; an onion; 15 grams (1/2 ounce) of butter, margarine, or olive oil; 900mL (1&1/2 pints) of vegetable stock or water; salt and pepper to taste., This is a quick, simple side-dish that can complement larger, meatier entrees. You can stew celery with olive oil, wine, and white sauce, among other things., Many recipes explicitly ask for celery (e.g. potato salad), but feel free to add it raw to any salad. You can also make it the star of a salad--for instance, consider making a lemon, celery, and Parmesan salad:


In a medium bowl, toss 4 thinly-sliced stalks of celery, 1/4 celery leaves, 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of finely grated lemon zest, 1 teaspoon of fresh lemon juice, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Gently toss the mixture with one ounce of Parmesan cheese. Serve cold or at room temperature., Celery adds a unique flavor and texture to mixed-vegetable stir-fries, and it goes well with many rice- and pasta-based Asian and Mediterranean dishes.Chop celery stems into bite-sized portions to cook. Keep the leaves whole, and treat them like any other leafy green: they cook quickly, so add them in later than the other vegetables.
Celery is 75% water, and the rest of its bulk is stringy and fibrous--so it does not need to cook for long. Do not expect the stems to change much when cooked. although they may soften and become less chewy.

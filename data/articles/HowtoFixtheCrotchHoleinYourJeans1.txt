 You can fix some small holes without using a patch, simply by sewing the sides of the small hole or tear back together. Before you do this, you should use some scissors to clean up the edges of hole so there aren’t any protruding loose threads. These will only get in the way as you work. Be careful not to make the hole any bigger as you do this.


Just cut frayed threads, not the actual fabric of the jeans.;
, Placing a knot at the far end of the thread will anchor it in the fabric once you start sewing. It can be frustrating to have to keep re-threading the needle, so be sure to get the thread tightly fixed.
 Seal the edges of the damaged area by looping thread around them and “tying” them shut. Be sure not to stitch so close to the edge that the thread simply pulls more jean fabric loose. This step is optional, but it can help stop fraying around the hole and increase the strength of your fix.


A blanket stitch or buttonhole stitch are good options for this.
 Press or hold the fabric so that the hole or tear in your jeans is nearly or completely shut. Then sew vertically across the hole to close it. (Note that you may have to stitch over this more than once to make it tight.) Start your stitches around a ½ inch to one side of the hole. Continue them to around ½ inch past the other side of the hole.


As you past the far-side of the hole, make the stitches gradually smaller.
Pull the thread tight, tie it off, and trim it so there are no loose ends.Start these stitches at least ½ inch further back than the stitches you just used to seal the edges of the gap.
You could also do this with a sewing machine, but if it is a very small hole, it could be just as easy to fix it by hand.

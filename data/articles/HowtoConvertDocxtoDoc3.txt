 If you'd rather not install anything or use the Terminal, you can use an online service that will handle the conversion process for you. Note: This isn't recommended for sensitive information, as you'll be uploading the document to a remote server for conversion. Popular services include:


Zamzar - zamzar.com/convert/docx-to-doc/

Free File Converter - freefileconvert.com/


, The process varies depending on the service, but generally you can browse your computer for the file or drag and drop it into the browser window.
 This will convert the file to the DOC format for you.
 It will likely take a few minutes for the file to be converted and delivered to your inbox.
 Use the download link in the email you receive to download the converted file to your computer. You can then open it as a DOC file in any version of Word.

 You can also jump in the shower to wet your hair, but do not apply shampoo. Shampoo will make the tangles even worse.Once your hair is wet, spray a good detangler product all over your hair.


After an all-over application, concentrate on applying the detangler generously around the knots and tangles.
 Whenever you’re working on a section, hold onto your hair near the root so that you aren’t jerking your scalp as you comb.


If your hair is very tangled, don’t try to get the tangle out right away. Instead, work on loosening the hair around the knot first.
 This time, focus the spray only on the knotted areas. Be sure to spray the knots themselves, as well as all of the hair immediately surrounding the knots. Gently massage the product into the hair. Then resume working at the tangles with the wide-toothed comb. Stop occasionally and use your fingers to separate some of the knotted hair, then continue trying to comb through the knots.


If you’re dealing with a very stubborn knot or matted hair, try using a detangling brush.
In most cases you shouldn’t brush wet hair, but a detangling brush can really if you're dealing with severely matted hair.
 Alternate these techniques until the tangle finally comes loose. Be gentle and patient with the tangles.


Getting out stubborn knots can be time-consuming, but rushing through the process can cause a lot of damage to your hair.

 Whether you are talking to a stranger or talking to a close friend in a public or social environment, you want to appear stable. Being overly emotional (regardless of the emotion) is seen socially as uncomfortable and immature. If you want to make people comfortable, avoid highly emotional topics and keep the conversation casual in public settings.For example, you could ask someone to meet you somewhere private like your home if you need to talk about something highly upsetting. This way, if you do show emotions, it will be more comfortable.
 It is also important to recognize the mood of the other person. This will help you distinguish what kinds of conversation are appropriate at the time. Things like sitting up straight and smiling would be a cue that someone is in a good mood. On the flip side, someone who is looking down at their feet might be nervous or upset.If someone is avoiding eye contact with you or seeming to be creating distance, than they are likely uncomfortable. If they are reaching toward you or looking directly at you, they are probably comfortable with you.
 Sharing emotions at appropriate times can strengthen bonds of friendship and family. This can make another person feel more comfortable with you. Tell them how you feel about a situation, or share something that is troubling you. This will make the other person feel trusted and important.


For example, talking to your friend about a difficult situation at home might make them feel that you trust them and value their friendship.

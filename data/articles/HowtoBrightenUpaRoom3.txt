 If you are working with a room with no windows or small windows, price up a small remodeling project to increase the size of the windows. An egress window in a basement runs between $3,000 and $6,000 and can turn a small room into a cheery bedroom.


Although this is an investment, putting an egress window and built-in closet in a basement room could increase the value of a home. Talk to a local realtor and contractor to see if this bright change is also a good financial decision.
 If you do, it may be bright during the day, but dark in the evening. Aim the light at the ceiling to make the room feel larger and brighter. , Lights above cabinets or around a focal point will give the room an extra layer of light. Point ambient lights up, not down, if possible.
 Choose a glass or crystal-looking chandelier to reflect more light from the windows.

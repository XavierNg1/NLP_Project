 When you’re taking your partner shopping to help improve their wardrobe, remember that the key to having a great sense of style is how the person wears their clothes. Instead of believing a higher price tag means great style, guide them to clothes that fit. Steer clear of shirts or pants that might be too loose or dresses and skirts that are too tight. People not only look better, but also feel better when their clothes actually fit., Helping your partner with their style does not mean they become your mannequin with no say about what they wear. The style they already have should act as a foundation to the looks you show and suggest they go with when you two shop for their closet.Although you’re styling your partner through your guidance, it is their personality that should drive the things you put them in. Consider how to get what’s on your partner’s outside to reflect what’s on their inside.For example, if your partner is into a sporty aesthetic, think of ways to elevate that initial sense of style. Instead of wearing strictly sweatpants, show them that a graphic jersey tee that has a sporty look to it without being sporty in a literal sense is a great way to take that old closet staple up a to the next level with a new look. Pair that with jeans and some clean sneakers or boots.
 Sometimes the footwear is forgotten about when putting together tops and bottoms, but they are actually a very integral part of a great outfit. Suggest to your partner that their shoe collection boasts the inclusion of classic shoes like Toms, Nikes, or Converses. For dressier events, oxfords, heels, or a great boot are other ways to be classic and stylish at the same time., Whether your partner has decided to take you up on your style advice or not, it’s worth it to suggest that they incorporate details in a way to emulate their style.Propose that they include personality in their outfits by adding ties, a watch, jewelry, and/or a hat.

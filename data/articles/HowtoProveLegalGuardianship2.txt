 In some states and circumstances, a parent or court-appointed legal guardian can grant a third person rights to act as a parent for limited activities. Be sure the power of attorney (POA) is properly executed according to the laws of your state. These laws are most likely a part of the state’s probate code. Appropriate activities to designate by POA include:Enrolling a child in a particular school
Obtaining medical care for the child
Managing the child’s financial position

, If a person or organization needs a copy of your POA, provide them a copy. Do not give them your original. It is likely that you will need it more than once. Organizations that ask for copies include:


Schools
Daycares
Medical Providers
Mental Health Providers
Banks

, If your POA is terminated, you should inform anyone who has been relying upon it that you are no longer the appropriate point of contact. This may mean that you also no longer have the right to receive any of the information regarding those issues. In general, POAs terminate by:Death of the principal or agent
Incapacity of the principal or agent
Revocation by the principal
By the terms of the POA
The purpose of the POA has been fulfilled

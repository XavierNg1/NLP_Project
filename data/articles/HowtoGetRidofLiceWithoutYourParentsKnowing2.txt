 Lice may not respond to home treatments. You might need to try medicated shampoos if your lice infestation does not respond to home remedies.


You may be able to find medicated shampoo at the local supermarket or drug store. It will usually be labeled as lice-killing shampoo. Some shampoo requires a doctor's prescription, but it might be difficult to see a doctor without your parents finding out about your lice.You can try biking to a local drug store, telling your parents you're going for a bike ride. Use your allowance to purchase the shampoo. To hide the shampoo, consider putting it in an empty container of your regular shampoo.
 If shampoo does not work, there are also medicated lotions you apply to your hair after showering that might kill the lice. Purchase this at a local drug store and find a way to hide it in your bathroom. If you normally use lotion or moisturizer, empty out a full bottle and replace it with the medicated lotion., Over-the-counter products will not work if you do not follow the instructions. Make sure you read the instructions carefully and apply the shampoo or lotion exactly as instructed. Pay attention to any warnings. Some products should not be used if you have particular health conditions or are below a certain age. You do not want to use any product that could be harmful to you.

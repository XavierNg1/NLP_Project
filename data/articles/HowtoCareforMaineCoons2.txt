 Maine Coons have thick coats that require some care to maintain. Their coats are oilier than most cats’ coats, so they do not require as much grooming as other long haired breeds, but they still need occasional grooming.Try to brush your Maine Coon once per week to keep his coat tangle-free.


Most Maine Coons do well with brushing, but it is a good idea to start brushing early to ensure that your Maine Coon will tolerate it.
To brush your Maine Coon, use a stainless steel comb and run it over your cat’s entire body. Give special attention to your cat’s tummy and tail because these can become matted more easily than other parts of your cat’s body.
 Your Maine Coon can wear down his claws somewhat by scratching and moving around, but he may still need a trim now and then. To keep your Maine Coon’s claws from becoming too long, you will need to trim them about once every three weeks.When you trim your Maine Coon’s claws, trim the white tips only. Do not trim the pink part of your cat’s claws further down the claw.
Do not use scissors to trim your Maine Coon’s claws. Use a special guillotine style pet nail trimmer.If you would rather not trim your cat’s nails yourself, then you can also take your cat to the veterinarian or groomer for a trim.
 Cats are prone to dental problems just like humans, so regular brushing is essential. Brush your Maine Coon’s teeth once per day to keep her teeth healthy. Make sure that you use a special cat toothbrush and toothpaste on your Maine Coon.Never use human toothpaste on your cat. Human toothpaste contains fluoride, which is toxic to cats.
 Maine Coons are more tolerant of water than most other cat breeds. In fact, some Maine Coons even enjoy the water, so bathing your Maine Coon now and then should not be too difficult.


Maine Coons do not need regular baths, but if your Maine Coon ever becomes dirty and requires a bath, then you should give her one.

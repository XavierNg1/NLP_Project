,, The zippers are easy to attach just by doing a neat stitch to hold them down. Pin them in place before you start stitching. You might even want to try the pants on and mark with a safety pin exactly where you want them.
 Place one pair just below your waist and one just below you knee. Do this by putting 2 inches (5.1 cm) of webbing through the ring.
 {FIG. 2} Webbing has a tendency to unravel and this will help keep that from happening, it will also reinforce the rings. You want these to be as strong as possible! {Note: the rings on the above pants are actually turned the wrong way... this is so you can see their placement. The rings should be horizontal and the webbing holding them on going down the leg.}

, Depending on your height you'll want to make them about 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) long. For every strap you'll need 3 feet 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) webbing, and 2 clasps. These can be found at fabric stores, hardware stores, camping supply and military surplus stores, and in many hardware sections of discount stores like Walmart. Loop the webbing around the loop on the clasp, and do the square/X stitch as above. Do this on both ends.

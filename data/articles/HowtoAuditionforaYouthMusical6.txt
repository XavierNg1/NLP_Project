 Take a few breaths before you go onstage. Then, just perform your very best and show them what you can do!


When you get onstage, tell the directors your name, age, and what you will be performing.
Perform loudly and face out.
Make everything you do bigger onstage. Small gestures and movements don't read well from the back of the theater.
If you mess up, just keep going and pretend it didn't happen. If you don't make a big deal about it, the directors probably won't even notice.
After your audition, thank the director for their time before leaving.
 After your audition, don't worry too much - there's nothing you can do now. Try to distract yourself with a book or playing games at home until the call-back list or the cast list is announced.
 Each and every role is essential to telling a story onstage. If you get a small role don't be disappointed and if you get a large role don't be cocky. Also, remember that if you didn't get the role you hoped for, it may not be because you didn't do well - it may be just because you didn't seem to be the right fit for the role. Sometimes, you just have to be persistent and keep auditioning for more shows and learning until you get your dream role!

 Typically, sheets of beeswax come very large and will make a rather ungainly candle. Cut your sheets to size so that they measure 4 inches (10.2 cm) x 16 inches (40.6 cm).
 Lay your sheet of beeswax out flat on a tabletop. Place your wick as close to the edge of one end as you are able to. Leave at least an inch of the wick hanging over the top edge, while the bottom of the wick should be flush to to bottom of your beeswax.
 Starting at the edge with the wick, roll the sheet of wax inwards. Try to roll in the same direction to avoid making the ends of the candle uneven or spiral-like. Apply gentle pressure to help the layers of beeswax to stick together.
 As you get to the end of the wax, use your fingers to stick the layers tightly together. Roll the candle between your hands so that the warmth of your skin softens the wax and helps it to maintain its shape. Place your new candle in your favorite candle holder and, voila! You’ve got a lovely decorative and useful addition to your home.

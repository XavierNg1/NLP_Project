 Use a coffee grinder to reduce the root to a fine powder. If you intend to mix the chicory root with coffee grounds, then you should try to grind your chicory to about the same coarseness as your coffee.


If you don't have a coffee grinder, try mincing the root very finely. Try using a mortar and pestle to crush the toasted root.
 The ratio is completely up to you. Coffee is caffeinated, and chicory is not. Chicory is usually somewhat more acidic than coffee, although some prefer the taste. Experiment with various ratios of chicory to coffee until you find a combination that suits you.Perhaps you only want to "cut" your coffee for the taste of the chicory. You may want to stretch your coffee supply so that it lasts a bit longer. Try a 1:4 or 1:5 ratio of chicory to coffee.
If you are trying to seriously reduce your coffee consumption, try a 1:2 or a 2:3 ratio of chicory to coffee.
Consider drinking a mostly-chicory blend. Perhaps you want the warmth and the taste of coffee, but not the stimulating effects. Try a 4:1 or 5:1 blend of chicory to coffee.
 Make coffee as you normally would, using a french press, a coffee machine, a pour-over, or a pot of boiling water. Use the mixed chicory-and-coffee grounds in place of straight coffee grounds. The brew time and the other logistics should be the same as making regular coffee.


Consider using chicory as a way to wean yourself off of coffee. Over the course of several weeks, gradually increase the ratio of chicory to coffee until you are drinking mostly non-caffeinated chicory.

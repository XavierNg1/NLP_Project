 Increasing your school’s “curb appeal” is one of the fastest and most inexpensive ways of improving it. Take a look around your school and see what kind of cosmetic changes you might be able to easily make. Picking weeds, pruning hedges, planting flowers, giving walls a fresh coat of paint, and picking trash up out of a field or parking lot are all ways of quickly making things look better., A school garden that students and staff can work on is a great way to increase involvement and pride in your school. Talk to your school administrators about getting permission first.A school garden can be whatever type people like—a flower garden, a vegetable garden, etc.
Work on the garden can be tied into educational activities. Science classes, for example, can learn about photosynthesis or the life cycle of plants by helping out with the garden.
 Making an inspiring painting part of your school is sure to improve it. Your school can start a discussion and vote on the design, which could be a school mascot, a historical figure, a local landmark, etc. Art classes at your school can even get involved with making the mural.


If your school wants to commission an outside artist to paint your mural, make sure the design, budget, and timeline for completion are worked out beforehand., Some schools, particularly older ones, may have hazardous substances present, such as lead paint, lead pipes, or asbestos. Removing these substances can be expensive and complicated. However, if members of your school community are concerned about these substances, talk to administrators or the local school board about what can be done to improve the school.

 Pour the hot chocolate mix and the flour into a 16-ounce (475-milliliter) mug. Stir the two together with a fork or mini whisk. You are using a large mug because the brownie needs room to rise as it cooks.


This recipe makes enough to serve 1 to 2 people. You can eat the brownie straight from the mug. If you'd rather serve it on a plate, lightly grease the inside of the mug first.
 Melt the butter ahead of time in the microwave or in a little saucepan over the stove. If you don't have any butter, you can use oil instead., Hot chocolate mix is already very sweet, but you can give your brownies extra flavor with Â½ teaspoon of vanilla extract. Peppermint extract would also taste delightful. Be sure to stir it in well!, What's hot chocolate without marshmallows? The microwave will help melt marshmallows. If you don't have any marshmallows, or if you don't like them, you can skip this step.
 Set your microwave to HIGH, then cook the brownie for 60 to 90 seconds. The brownie will rise as it cooks, but then it will deflate slightly once you stop the microwave. Do not overcook the brownie, however; you want it to be gooey in the center.Place a paper towel or paper plate under the mug to catch any drips in case the brownie overflows.
 If you did not add any marshmallows, consider garnishing your brownie with other popular hot chocolate toppings. A swirl of whipped cream and a sprinkle of crushed candy cane would taste delicious!


If you greased the inside of the mug, turn the brownie out onto a plate first, then garnish it.

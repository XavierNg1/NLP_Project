Whichever unit of measurement you use, measure all dimensions in the same unit of measurement.
You could also measure the unit in centimeters, but converting centimeters cubed to meters cubed (the final measurement) can be very cumbersome. Instead, divide the centimeter measurements by 100 to convert them to meters before you move on.
The word "unit" refers to whatever quantity the item is being sold/packaged in. So a single bottle, box or bag would be a unit. But if the item in question is being sold as a 3-pack of bottles, you'd have to measure all 3 bottles, as they're packaged together, to get the dimensions for calculating the case cube.;
,, The resulting number is the case cube in feet cubed. If your measurements were in meters, no division is necessary; your result is the case cube in meters cubed.

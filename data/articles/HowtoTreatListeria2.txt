 As mentioned earlier, listeriosis may spread to your nervous system, leading to a stiff neck, a headache, loss of balance, convulsions, and/or an altered level of consciousness. If you notice any of these signs or symptoms, seek medical help immediately.


Also see a doctor if you have poor overall health, or are elderly, as your immune system may be weaker than the average person and you may need medical support fighting off your infection.
Always see a physician if you are pregnant, or if you suspect that your newborn has listeriosis, as this can be very serious if prompt medical attention is not received.
 Antibiotics are generally not needed in healthy adults with a mild infection, whose immune systems are competent enough to fight off the infection; however, antibiotics are generally offered to:


Elderly patients
Pregnant women (as a means to protect the unborn baby)
Newborns
Individuals with other medical conditions leading to overall weakened immune systems (such as HIV/AIDS, an organ transplant, or other autoimmune conditions)
People in whom the Listeria bacteria has spread to infect their nervous system, which always requires emergency medical care.
 As such, it requires prompt medical treatment and ongoing monitoring, usually in a hospital setting. If your newborn appears ill and has any of the symptoms mentioned above, seek prompt medical attention for diagnosis. Normally, a few different antibiotics will be given to your newborn in order to provide the maximum treatment possible. Your newborn will also be monitored (usually in the hospital setting) where the doctors can keep track of his or her vital signs and overall health. This way, if any complications occur, they can be recognized and handled by experienced medical professionals as soon as possible.


Signs of a possible listeriosis in a newborn include irritability, fever, vomiting, and a decreased interest in feeding.

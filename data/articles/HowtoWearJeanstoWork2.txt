 Light jeans may be too casual to wear to the office, especially if they look distressed or faded.
 Straight leg jeans typically fit best and mimic the look of trousers. Boot cut jeans, on the other hand, often look too baggy and unpolished for the office.
 This should go without saying, but it is too important not to say. Do not wear jeans that have holes in the knee or frayed hems at the bottom. Your office jeans should be in clean, crisp condition.
 Choose a collared shirt you would usually wear with a suit. By wearing an office appropriate shirt, you make your jeans look more office appropriate, as well. Light colors like white or sky blue are your best bets, but if you feel a little more daring, try a richer hue.
 Even though they are not as professional as a button-down shirt, polo shirts are relatively standard for "business casual" looks. This makes them a good match for your jeans.
 Flannel shirts look a little more casual, but a well-fit flannel shirt can still have a conservative look to it.
 Choose one in a standard color, like navy blue, black, or dark brown, and wear it over a button-down shirt or plain t-shirt. Blazers add structure and a sense of professionalism to an otherwise casual outfit.
 A pull-over sweater in a solid color looks conservative and classy, especially when paired with a button-down shirt. Cardigan sweaters may work, as well, but they tend to look slightly more casual on men than a pull-over sweater looks.
 A dark pair of dress shoes will create a clean-cut appearance by giving your jeans a boost of class.
 A thick, dark belt will keep your jeans where they need to be, and it may also help create a more polished appearance.

 An effective and natural rose water makeup remover will contain some oil. Coconut oil is inexpensive and both the coconut oil and rose water are nourishing for your skin. Rose water can be purchased at an organic food store, such as Whole Foods. Coconut oil is frequently available at most grocery stores.
 Mix equal parts rose water and coconut oil together. Since coconut oil is solid at room temperature, it can help to warm the coconut oil on the stove first so that it melts. Use a wooden spoon or whisk to mix the ingredients together well.
 Once you have combined the ingredients, pour the mixture into a jar, such as a Mason or Bell jar. This will make it easy to dip into the mixture with a spoon or your fingers. Coconut oil hardens at room temperature but will melt if you rub it between your fingers and hands. You may need to dig some of the mixture out with a spoon whenever you use it from the jar.
 To remove makeup from your face, apply the mixture to your fingers or spread it on a cotton pad or ball. Rub the areas that contain makeup, until all of it has been removed. You may need to replace the cotton ball or pad with a fresh one as it gets saturated with makeup.

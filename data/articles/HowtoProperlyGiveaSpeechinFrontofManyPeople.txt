 Write your speech well in advance, and remember to shoot for your target audience. Make sure you get to the place where you are giving your speech with time to spare. A backup copy of your speech is useful, even if just for peace of mind.;
, Read your speech anytime you have the opportunity: to your friends, your family, or in the mirror. Try to memorize parts of your speech; this will leave you free to make eye contact.
 Relax. Take a deep breath. Being nervous will not help your speech-giving ability any.
 Keep your voice level and even. Don't go too fast or too slow. Enunciate clearly, and try to avoid having your voice crack. Drink a bit of water if you need to.
 Don't speak to your podium. Look at your audience. This will also help to project your voice.
 A smile will help put your audience - and you - at ease.

 Look on YouTube and watch movies and interviews for good examples of what you're trying to emulate. However, beware of impersonators out there -- and there are plenty.


Brad Pitt, Richard Gere, and Tom Cruise are not good examples. Stick to true native speakers; RTÃ‰ is a safe place to start. It is important to note that the northern counties have a quite different accent .
 In the same respect you never truly master a foreign language if you don't live in the country, you will never master an accent if you don't live among the people.


If you go for vacation, do your best to feel out the local flavor. Go to small restaurants and listen to those around you. Make small talk with the vendors on the streets. Hire a native tour guide to show you around. Make your exposure as 24/7 as possible.
 Just as there are American and British English dictionaries, there are Irish dictionaries, too. What's more, resources abound when it comes to sources on colloquialisms and idiosyncrasies of the accent. Invest your time and money into this endeavor if you truly want your accent to shine.


If a dictionary seems a bit much and would just rest on your shelf gathering dust, buy a phrase book. The idioms and figures of speech will help you get into the emerald zone.

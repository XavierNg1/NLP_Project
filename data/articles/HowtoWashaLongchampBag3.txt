 Remove everything from the inside of the bag and place it in an empty washing machine.You can clean the bag by itself or with other items, but make sure that the other items you place in the washing machine can bleed or otherwise damage the bag.
 A standard liquid laundry detergent should be fine, but opt for one that is dye-free and fragrance-free if possible.


The detergent should be as mild as possible to minimize the risk of damage.
If you want to be especially caution, skip the detergent and opt for a more gentle, natural cleansing product, like Murphy's oil soap or liquid castile soap.Only use about 1/4 cup (60 ml) of soap for this process.
 Both the agitation and temperature settings should be mild, so choose one of the gentlest settings on your machine and set the water temperature to "cool" or "warm." After making your selections, start the machine.


A "wool" setting should work well, but a "delicate," "gentle," or "hand wash" cycle might be better.
The temperature of the water should be somewhat cool, approximately 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius).
 After you remove the bag from the washing machine, hang it from its straps on a clothes hanger and let it air dry for four to five hours, or until it is completely dry.


To speed up the drying process, you could toss the bag into a drying machine and run the dryer on its lowest heat setting. Make sure that there are other items in the dryer, like large towels, to further reduce heat exposure. Dry the bag this way for five to ten minutes, then finish hang drying it for another hour or so.
You can also speed up the drying process by placing it in a sunny spot as it hangs.
 Place a little commercial leather conditioner on a clean, soft rag and buff the conditioner into the leather portions of the bag.


Conditioner softens the leather and protects it from further stains and possible water damage.

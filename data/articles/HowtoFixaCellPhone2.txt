 When you accidentally drop your phone, the first thing that can be damaged is its screen. When you can see cracks or dead pixels on the screen, it might be time to replace it.


Go to any cell phone accessory or repair shop and try looking for a replacement screen.
Just like batteries, you need to find the exact replacement screen for your particular phone model. Do not modify any aftermarket phone screens to fit yours because it will not work.
 Slide it or flip it off your phone’s base casing to reveal its back panel.
 Do this using a screwdriver. Depending on the make and model of your phone, you’ll either need a Philips or Torx screwdriver.


After removing the back panel, check if there are any screws holding the motherboard in place and remove it first. Normally, the phone’s motherboard should safely come off too, giving you access to the phone’s screen.
 These two are usually just connected using plugin-type connectors. Gently pull off the connectors to release it from each other.
 If you’ve bought the same exact replacement screen for your phone, you should see the same plugin-type connectors on the new screen, allowing you to easily join it with the motherboard.
 Make sure that everything’s firmly in place and that no parts, internal or external, are loosely placed.


Shake the phone a little (not too hard!) and check if you can hear some parts rattling. If you do, check the connections inside again and tighten anything that’s not held in place firmly.

 It's not safe to clean a wound with material that aren't sterile. In the future, carry a fist aid kit when camping. This way, you'll have clean gauze and other supplies on hand in the event of an accident or injury. Working with clean and sterile material greatly reduces the risk of a wound becoming infected.
 Tetanus is a bacteria disease that affects a sufferer's nervous system. Bacteria that causes tetanus can be found in dust, soil, and dirt. A wound accrued when camping or hiking can cause tetanus if you have not been vaccinated.Check your vaccination records. You can usually get these from your doctor. As a lot of vaccinations are given out when you're young, try asking your parents. They may know where your vaccination record is.
If you have not had a tetanus shot in the past 5 years, get one. It's especially important to get vaccinated before camping, as you do not want to get tetanus if you end up wounded. If you're being treated for a wound at the hospital, a tetanus shot may be reccomended., When camping, know your surroundings. When you set up your tent, do so during the day. Scan the area for bumps, hills, and crevices. Know where you're likely to slip and fall, and avoid these areas to prevent injuries., If you go camping, make sure you know how to access emergency services quickly. Know where the nearest highway is, and take an emergency flare or whistle so you can call for help if necessary. It's also a good idea to carry a charged cell phone when camping. In the event you need assistance, you can call for help on your cell.

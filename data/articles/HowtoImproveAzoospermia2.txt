 If you take a medication that interferes with sperm production, ask your doctor to help you find an alternative. If you take recreational drugs, try to stop using them. While chemo and radiation therapies can interfere with sperm production, the reproductive system often recovers within two to three months after treatment.It's best not to stop taking a medication without talking to your doctor first.
Have your sperm analyzed again around three months after switching medications, stopping drug use, or finishing chemo or radiation therapy.
 If your specialist tracks down a blockage, chances are high that it can be surgically repaired without complications.Depending on the obstruction’s location, your urologist can perform one of two routine, minimally invasive procedures:Microsurgery, which involves a small incision that's used to repair the parts that connect the testes to the rest of the reproductive tract.
Endoscopic surgery, which involves a small, flexible tube used to repair the urethra and ejaculatory duct.
 Hormone and blood screenings can detect nonobstructive azoospermia that's caused by a hormone imbalance. Your specialist will prescribe an oral or injectable hormone regimen. Cases involving hormonal imbalance have a high recovery rate, and natural pregnancy is often possible., Varicoceles, or enlarged veins on the scrotum, can cause nonobstructive azoospermia. Ask your urologist if they recommend varicocelectomy, which is a procedure that can repair the problematic veins.Sperm counts increase in nearly half of men who undergo varicocelectomy.
 You can still try sperm retrieval if surgical or hormonal treatments are unsuccessful or aren’t options. Prior to retrieval, you'll take hormones to help your body produce more viable sperm. After a few months, your fertility specialist will extract sperm from the testes to use for in vitro fertilization.

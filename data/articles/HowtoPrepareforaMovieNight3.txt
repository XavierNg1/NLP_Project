 If you want a theme, you may want to watch horror films, or maybe a comedy theme. You can watch a series of movies such as Harry Potter. If you like, you can watch your favorite TV series, as long as you don't stay up all night.
 Make sure you have lots of comfy pillows and blankets, depending on what the temperature is like. For example, a bed or a comfortable couch is an ideal spot to set up. Make sure a TV is close enough to see and hear clearly from where you will be spending the night.
 Stack them neatly next to your television, or wherever is available to put your DVDs.
 Bed socks and pajamas are very good to wear while watching your movies. Possibly a onesie if you have one.
 Popcorn is a classic and you can't go wrong with chips and dip. Peanuts are good (if you like them and are not allergic) so is sliced fruit, to make sure you aren't just pigging out unless that's what you want to do. Drinks are a must, such as water, soda or juice.
 If it isn't, quickly clean up any rubbish, clothes and other junk laying around near or at your area of choice.
 Put in your disc and enjoy the night!

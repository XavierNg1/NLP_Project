 Get a bottle of clear or natural nail varnish and give every nail a coat of polish. Alternatively, if you have fragile, brittle, or weak nails you can use a nail hardener instead of clear varnish. Let it dry completely before moving on.
 Choose the polish color you like and apply it carefully to each nail. Using the right painting technique will help your nails look like they were done by a professional. Here's how to do it:









Dip your brush in the bottle and brush it against the opening so that you have one small drop of polish on the end of the brush. Too much polish will result in a mess.
Paint a vertical stroke in the middle of your nail first nail - usually your thumb. Start at the base and paint all the way to the tip.
Paint another stroke on the left side, and one on the right side. Re-dip the brush if necessary. Blend with more vertical strokes.
Continue with the rest of your nails until they're all painted.
 Depending on what color nail polish you used, you might want to do a second coat to make it look completely opaque. Make sure the first coat is completely dry first.
 After the polish is completely dry, add one more clear topcoat. This will seal your manicure so it doesn't chip for a week or two.
 When the nail varnish starts to chip beyond repair, use a gentle nail polish remover to get rid of the nail polish. Make sure the remover does not contain acetone and be very gentle. Instead of acetone, look for a remover that contains ethyl acetate. If you are using a water based nail polish keep in mind that removers for conventional polishes won't work; you will need to buy a remover specifically made for water based polishes. Be careful when removing polish, harsh scrubbing will damage the nails.









Giving your nails a break after you remove the polish is a good idea. Wait a week or two before painting them again.

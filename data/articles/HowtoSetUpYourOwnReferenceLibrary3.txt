 Unlike a fiction library, searching by author is difficult because many reference books are written by more than 1 person. Research the Dewey Decimal system, the Library of Congress System, or reserve a shelf for each subject.
 There are a number of programs that are made for this function and offer you the ability to search by subject, author, bar code and more.


Electronic databases allow you to create your own card catalog. Good programs include LibraryThing, GuruLib, BookCAT, Reader2 and Shelfari. Some programs have both a free and a paid option. The free account may allow you to catalog a few hundred items, but you would need a paid account to add more.
If you own an Apple computer, then Delicious Monster may be the best program for you. It includes a bar code scanning process and a media cataloging function.
 Many online stamp makers provide personalized library stamps.
 Lay them flat to avoid excess damage to the spines. Place other books 1 inch (2.5Â cm) from the back of the shelves for better air circulation.

 If you're going to try to scratch someone else's itch for them, the most important way to ensure success to keep talking to them. Understand exactly where they want to be scratched, and how. Everyone's skin tolerance is a bit different, so it's best to start gentle and adjust depending on the way they respond.
 As with itching yourself, this is usually a straightforward step. However, when you're scratching someone else, it again requires some communication to find where you should be itching. This will arguably require more effort on the part of your partner, who will need to cautiously direct your movements.


If you're having any difficulty with finding the spot, you can play the 'hot/cold' game; the person will say 'hotter' if you're getting closer to the afflicted area. Likewise, the person will say 'colder' if you're getting further away from it.
 Unless you already know your partner's scratching preferences, it's best to stay as gentle as you can at first. Much as if you were scratching yourself, you should stick to a slow and concentrated scratch. While you're scratching the person, you should remain just as alert regarding their signs. Are they enjoying it? Are they in pain? It is always better to be too gentle than too rough, so be safe at first and increase the intensity at the partner's discretion.


At the same time, don't be afraid to get more intense! Your partner's skin could very well be tougher than yours, so you shouldn't be shy about digging in slightly more than you normally would.

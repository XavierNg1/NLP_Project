 Of course, as addictive as YouTube might be, you may still have valid reasons for watching certain videos. If you’re looking to spend less time on casual viewing only, bury apps and bookmarks in new folders. Hide them so the icons and links aren’t there to greet and tempt you first thing.

With phones or tablets, you can also take the added step of creating additional pages to your home screen. Banish the YouTube app to the last one, well away from those you use the most, so you have to swipe a ridiculous number of times to reach it.
 Maybe your problem is that YouTube distracts you when you’re supposed to be concentrating on something else, like work or studies. If that’s the case, go to the site-blocking settings in your browser or its add-on. Then, instead of having it block the site all the time, enter a start- and end-time to block it during those hours that are supposed to be devoted to other activities.There are also numerous apps available for download to accomplish this.
 Part of what makes YouTube so addictive is that it’s available on so many devices. Pretend that isn’t the case. Choose just one or two to use for YouTube while eliminating it from all the others. Which to choose will depend on your situation. For instance:

If your job or studies require you to watch or post videos, designate your computer as your sole YouTube device. Then refrain from watching it on your TV, phone, or tablet.
If you need it for, say, video tutorials on DIY projects around the house, designate a single mobile device as your tool instead.

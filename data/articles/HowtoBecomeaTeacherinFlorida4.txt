Recommendations from coworkers, supervisors, or even former students
A resume
A teaching philosophy
A list of courses you have taught or can teach., There are a number of job boards on the internet where you can view postings for teaching jobs in Florida. While some websites may only have jobs for schools in a certain region, others may include jobs throughout the entire state.

View the website of the school or district you want to teach in. For example, visit Lake County School's employment site at: http://www.lake.k12.fl.us/employment., Perhaps the best source of leads about available jobs are your friends. These leads are important since your friends will know the circumstances of the position and may be able to recommend you to the administrator or committee who makes the hiring decision.


If you have friends who teach in the district you want to teach, as them if they know of any positions.
Tell friends who you may not know have connections in public schools. They may know someone who has a connection and could recommend you.
Many teaching jobs are secured through some sort of social connection.
 A great way to get your foot in the door is to become a substitute teacher in the school or district you want to teach in. By becoming a substitute teacher, you'll get to know other teachers and administrators. When it comes time to hire new faculty, you may find yourself on the short list.


The district or temp agency employing you will make sure you meet the minimum requirements of a high school diploma.
You'll have to pass a background check. Any drug convictions like a felony will make it very hard for you to become a substitute teacher.

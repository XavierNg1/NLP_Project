 Clay masks are spread over the face and allowed to dry. As the water from the mask begins to evaporate, the clay pulls away from the skin and takes dead skin cells and debris that clog pores with it. Make your own clay mask using the following technique:


Mix 1 tablespoon of bentonite clay, 1 tablespoon of oatmeal and 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Use a spoon to stir until the ingredients are combined.
Apply the mixture to your face, taking care to cover all the areas where your pores are clogged. Allow it to sit until it dries, about 15 minutes.
Wash off the mask with warm water and pat your face dry with a soft towel. Your pores should no longer be clogged.
 These types of masks are available at specialty beauty stores. They exfoliate the skin with acids that eat away the dead skin cells, leaving your face looking renewed.


Rinse your face, pat it dry and apply the acid mask all over. Don't apply too much on the fragile skin near your eyes. Let the mask sit for 15 minutes.
Rinse off the mask with warm water and dry your face with a towel. Apply moisturizer to protect your face from drying out.

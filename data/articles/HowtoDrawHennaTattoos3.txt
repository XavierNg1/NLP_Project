 For this you will need your original design (made with ballpoint ink on white copy paper), scissors, and clear deodorant. First, cut out your design. Next, apply a thin layer of clear deodorant to the location on your body where you want your stencil. Then, apply your design to this location, ink side down. Hold it firmly in place for five seconds. Then slowly peel away the paper and the image should appear on your skin.
 Practice using your squeeze bottle to create a thick, accurate line. You can do this on a sheet of paper or a paper towel. Be sure you are comfortable using the squeeze bottle before you begin applying the henna to your skin.
 Using your squeeze bottle, slowly and carefully trace the stencil you have made on your body with thin lines of henna paste. Shake your bottle regularly to avoid clumps.








Fortunately, henna works very slowly and takes a long time to dry.
If you make a mistake, simply wipe off the henna with a paper towel and apply it again.
 Henna ink will require a minimum of two hours to dry and stain your skin, or up to five hours for a nice dark image. Leave the henna on your skin for no less than two hours, but preferably closer to five.You can watch a movie, listen to an audio book, or hang out with a friend while you wait!

, Using a damp cloth or paper towel, carefully remove the dried henna paste from your body. Your henna tattoo should be effectively stained into your skin. This tattoo should last 2-3 weeks.

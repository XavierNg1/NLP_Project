 You may be able to use a wire brush to scrub off the rust. A sandblaster or rust-removing chemical products can also be used if you need to take off a lot of rust and are not worried about possible damage to the cast iron.


Wear proper safety equipment if working with a power tool or chemical to remove the rust. This may include gloves, goggles and a respirator.;
, The sanding can be done lightly. Gather up and properly discard chipped or peeling paint, which could be lead-based.
 Remove any dirt, dust, stains, or other items such as cobwebs. You may need a brush to clean the cast iron.
 You may need to throw away the clothes after painting the cast iron.
 Use a flat surface or material to collect dripped paint as you work. A table or drop cloth material may be possible options.
 Use the rag to clean your hands while you paint. The spirits can clean your painting tools and thin your paint.
 Choose an oil-based primer. Follow the primer's directions for how many coats you need. Allow time for a coat of primer to dry before applying another if necessary.
 Dip 1/4-inch (0.63 cm) of your paintbrush into the paint at a time. This will help prevent less paint from running and dripping off the brush.


Give the iron 2 coats of paint. Wait 24 hours for the first coat of paint to dry before applying the second one.

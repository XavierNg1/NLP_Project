 This will most likely be part of your county’s Department of Public Health or equivalent office. Search the CDPH’s website for the address, business hours, and phone number for your county’s program. Call ahead to see if they accept walk-ins or if you’ll need to make an appointment. Also ask how much they charge for the processing fee, since this may vary by county.You have to apply through the MMP in the same county where you live. This means that you’ll still have to go to your own county’s MMP even if another county’s office happens to be closer to you.
Each county’s MMP can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/services/Pages/MMPCounties.aspx.
 Visit your county’s MMP in person. Bring your application, other documentation, and enough money to cover the processing fee. Your MMIC will be a photo ID, but don’t worry about bringing a picture of yourself, since the office will photograph you themselves.

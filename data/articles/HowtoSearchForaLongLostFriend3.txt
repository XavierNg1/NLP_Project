 Determine if you know or have means to contact anybody in your long-lost friend's family. This may sound obvious, but you never want to overlook the obvious on a search for a long-lost friend.
 Write a list of all the people who knew your long-lost friend. Chances are you know some of these people as well. Reach out to them. Even if they don't have your long-lost friend's exact contact information, any tidbits will likely be helpful to you.
 While your instinct may be to rush to the internet, you may have more success by using what you know about your friend offline. Where did you meet each other? What other towns have they lived in?


If you know their "old house" and can visit their it, you may have luck knocking on the new owner's door and explaining that you lost touch with your long-lost friend.
Another idea is to approach the next-door neighbors of your friend's old house. Maybe they know what happened to your friend.
 If you’re searching for a friend from your high school days, consider calling the high school and getting contact information for the alumni association. If it’s a college friend, contact the university about alumni association details, and ask if there’s a specific alumni network for any of the friends’ interests. (Maybe the friend was with the school newspaper or the intramural tennis team?) .
 This option may be the last resort if you have money to spend. Through a service like the White Pages or Angie’s List, search for a private investigator.


To decide if a private investigator is a good, safe fit, ask them about their experience. Also ask them if they have an office where you can find them, if they have insurance, and if they are licensed. The only states that don’t require a private investigator license are Mississippi, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Colorado.

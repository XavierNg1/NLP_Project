 In most cases, you will be given the length, but if not, you can find it using a ruler.


Note that the double hash marks on the long sides of the rectangle mean that the lengths of the two sides are the same.
 Use the same methods to find it.


Note that the single hash marks on the wide sides of the rectangle mean that the two widths have equal length.
 In this example, the length is 5 cm and the width is 4 cm.
 Your length is 5 cm and your width is 4 cm, so you should plug them into the equation A = L * W to find the area.


A = 4 cm * 5 cm
A = 20 cm^2

, Your final answer is 20 cm^2, which means "twenty centimeters squared."


You can write your final answer in one of two ways: either 20 cm.sq. or 20 cm^2.

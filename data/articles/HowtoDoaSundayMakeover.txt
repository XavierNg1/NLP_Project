 You can either take a long, hot shower or a warm bath. Shave your legs and body, exfoliate your body, and wash with a nice-smelling shower gel.;
, After your hair is clean, squeeze the excess water gently out of your hair. Step out of the bath or shower, and pat your body dry. You can now either apply a deep-conditioning hair mask and cover with a cap to leave in, or wrap hair in a fluffy, nice towel.
 Put on a robe or something light, such as your favorite pajamas.
 Rub ice over the area if you have pain or redness after ward. Wait a few minutes.
 Leave it on for 10-20 minutes, and rinse or peel it off. Cleanse your face with a gentle cleanser, and if needed, an acne soap. Pat your skin dry, and pat on moisturizer.
 Pick out your favorite nail polish. Lay out on a table paper towels, cotton balls, q-tips, nail polish, nail polish remover, and a base-top coat polish.
 Over the paper towels, apply a base coat, 2-3 coats of nail polish color, and a top coat. Wait for nails to dry. If you need to correct mistakes, put a bit of remover on the tip of a q-tip and swipe off the mistake.
 Read some magazines or a book, or watch your favorite show. Make a snack to eat, and your favorite drink.
 Relax, then go to sleep early!

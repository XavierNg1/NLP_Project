, In origami,a valley fold is when you fold the paper in half so it forms a 'V'.Unfold the paper.
 There should be three horizontal creases that divide the paper into four equal sections.
, Unfold the paper and lay it flat on the table. At this point the creases should form 16 squares that run four-across and four-down.
 Unfold.
 When you unfold your paper, the creases should form 16 equal-sized squares plus an 'X' that runs from the top-left to bottom-right corner, and top-right to bottom-left corner.
 Apply a vertical valley fold on the left corner of your diamond. Do not unfold. Your diamond should have three pointed and one flat corner.
 This pattern uses a series of valley and mountain folds along preexisting creases. Here is a diagram showing the location and type of folds.









The opposite of a valley fold is a mountain fold, where the paper is folded to form a upside-down "V"., At this point, your jet should resemble a "shoe" with a pointed toe. Next, fold the base (longest edge) up so it covers about 1/3rd of the "shoe".
 This section will eventually form the wings. Repeat fold on the opposite side.
 Spread the wings by gently pulling them out to the sides.
 Hold it near the nose so the plane is either perpendicular to the ground or the nose is pointed slightly up. Throw the plane overhanded using a fast, smooth motion.









Compare the flight distance and speed of your origami jet to your origami plane.

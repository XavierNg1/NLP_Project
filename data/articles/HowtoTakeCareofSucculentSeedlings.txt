 Their root system is close to the soil surface during the first months of growth, meaning that they dry out very quickly.;

 Transplant outdoors to fresh seedling trays or into large pots for continued growth, to encourage the setting of deeper roots. On transplanting, keep the plant in a warm place for 48 hours and withhold any watering during this time. The 48 hour break gives the rootstock a chance to recover from being moved.
 As the succulent grows larger, it will need less tending and less watering. Plant in the garden bed when it is larger, if wished.

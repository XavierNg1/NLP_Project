 Make a list of your proudest moments; these will be subjective, but could range from graduating college to having a kid to staying in close touch with a friend who lives far away.If it matters to you, and you have achieved it, write it down.


Use this list as a motivator: a milestone age is the perfect time to add a new achievement (or several!) to the list.
 Perhaps you would have liked to have spent more time with friends and acquaintances, or perhaps you wish you had gone to the gym every day. A milestone age is the ideal time to take note and make any changes for future endeavors.
 If the transition was a positive one, it can help you see your upcoming one as a potentially great one too. Take that previous approach and try to translate it to this new milestone.


Say you coped extremely well with turning 18: consider why that was the case. Perhaps you were excited about the doors that you knew would open up, or maybe you were thrilled about the freedom typically associated with that age. So now, if you are now turning 40, ask yourself what the benefits of this age are. These could range from greater confidence to having more knowledge about who you are and what you stand for., The fact that reaching a previous milestone was not all it was lived up to be does not at all have to translate to your upcoming birthday. Consider these to be independent events.


Do, however, try to take your previous experience and learn from it. Perhaps you felt unprepared to be 27; if that was the case, and you fear the same thing will happen this time, take precautionary steps starting now. Think about how you can best prepare for this new age ahead of time.

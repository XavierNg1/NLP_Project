 By means of these elements text can be added to an object.

The exceptions to this are control elements like buttons or list boxes, as well as 3D scenes and their associated elements and groups.
 The status bar shows at lower left “Text Edit” and the position of the cursor within the text.


Text can contain paragraphs and these can be in the form of bulleted or numbered lists. For a new line without beginning a new paragraph, use (as in text documents) the key combination Shift+Enter. To end the text input, click next to the object or press the Esc key.

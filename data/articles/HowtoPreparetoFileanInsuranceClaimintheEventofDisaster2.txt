 To ensure that you get expert representation with your insurance company, and maximize your entitlement under the terms of your policy, having such a person in your employ is essential.
 It may be faster and more cost-effective to do all this over the phone rather than filling in forms and faxing or posting them. Or better still - have your insurance loss assessor report your claim for you.


Insurance companies usually require a claimant to notify them or their broker of a loss incurred within 30 days of an incident giving rise to a possible claim. Do this to protect your interests as your insurers may be quick to use this technicality to avoid paying your claim.
 There may be a lot of paperwork to collate, including receipts, replacement estimates and repair costs. Your insurance company may insist that you use their own preferred suppliers for repairs and replacements - check the details on your home insurance policy or ask your insurers about this when reporting your claim before you get too "busy" doing their job.
 It is best to do this as soon as possible, within 24 hours of the incident.
 In the event of a loss which could possibly lead to a liability claim, never admit liability on the insurer's behalf at the incident. You could be accused of prejudicing insurers and they could, in turn, decline liability and hold you responsible for the loss.

Have a LBD (little black dress), a white t-shirt and a good pair of jeans. Those are your basics. They go with anything. For example, the LBD can be paired with red pumps and a wide red belt to make a super-cute IN outfit!
Look in fashion magazines and find outfits you love and look around in inexpensive stores for look-a-like items.
Buy more accessories than clothes because accessories are the personal touch you give to things, and that is more important than fashion itself.
If you wear skirts or dresses and don't have the nicest legs, use leg make-up, nylons, or avoid shorter skirts/dresses.
See what looks good on you rather than blindly following what you see in the latest fashion magazine. Skinny jeans may be in but if you don't have the shape to carry them off, you will end up being a fashion victim.
 Shoes can make or break the outfit, so pick wisely.


Have your shoes match a small accent in your outfit, like if you have a red belt, wear red shoes. It you have a wide visible green hem, wear green shoes.
Wear high heels. It gives you a sexy feeling, it makes your butt, and legs look better. If you can't walk in them, ask someone who can to teach you before you ever wear them out in public and start with shorter heels.
Have some sneakers or flats for the days you have to run, or the days when you simply aren't in the mood for sore feet.

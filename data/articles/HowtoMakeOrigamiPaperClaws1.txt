 Position the paper horizontally. You can use any type of paper you have lying around the house. If you want sturdier claws, then use thicker paper.;
, Align the fold to the paper's bottom. The left side of the sheet now has a point.
 It should look like a rectangle that is missing a corner.
 Align the top edge to the diagonal edge. This should now be in the shape of a square. Position the paper with the right angle of the triangle pointing up, or away from you.
 Fold the square along the diagonal line. This should create a triangle.
 Imagine a vertical line dividing the triangle in half, from the point to the base, right down the middle. You're creating a right triangle.


You may want to draw this line in pencil the first couple of times. Use a T-square to make sure the line down the middle is at a right angle to the base of the triangle.
This fold is to form a crease that will be important for the following fold.
 Unfold the recently formed right triangle and fold the two edged side directly to the half-way line of the triangle. The fold's outer edge should be going straight down, perpendicular to the bottom and even extending below the bottom of your triangle.
 Fold the same side over itself again. You should be able to see the claw coming into form.


Be careful to line each fold with your imaginary pencil line.
Make sure you keep each fold very tight and at the same angle. If the folds start to slant upwards, instead of staying aligned, the claw won't be as sturdy.
 You may need to open the hole for the flap up with your finger. Hold it so the opening is visible and easy to insert one flap.
 Simply stick your finger into the smaller triangle to open it up. This will look like a knuckle for the claw.


It may be a tight fit at first.
The tighter the fit the more likely the claw will stay on your finger.

 When you are preparing dry formula, make sure that you mix it together very well. Get rid of all clumps or pockets of dry formula. It should all be blended and smooth.Wait for the bubbles to get out of the formula before feeding it to the dogs.
 Before you give the puppy formula, you need to get it to the right temperature. Place the bottle in a mug or bowl of hot water. Don’t heat the formula itself in the microwave or in a pot.Put the formula on your wrist to test the temperature. It should be warm, but not hot.
 Make sure to keep your formula stored properly to keep your puppy safe. After mixing or opening formula, you keep it in the refrigerator and use it all day. However, you should throw away the leftover formula at the end of the day.If you use dry formula, you can keep the canister in the freezer. Don’t place the cans in the freezer.

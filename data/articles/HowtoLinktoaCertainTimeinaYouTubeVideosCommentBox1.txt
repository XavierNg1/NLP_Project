, This should be a video on which you wish to leave a comment. You can do so in a couple of different ways:


Tap the magnifying glass icon in the top-right corner of the screen, type in a video's name, and tap Search.
Tap a video on the Home screen from one of your recent subscriptions.
Tap the Subscriptions tab at the bottom of the screen (iPhone) or the top of the screen (Android) and select a video.
 You should pause the video at the point you wish to link. You'll see the time stamp in the bottom-left corner of the video section in hours:minutes:seconds format.


For example, if you paused the video one minute and thirty seconds in, you'll see "1:30" in the bottom-left corner of the window.
 You'll find it below the list of related videos that are directly beneath the video itself.
 Doing so will automatically create a link to that point in the video when you post your comment.


For the previous example, you might type "Hey, what happened at 1:30?" to call attention to your paused point.
 It's in the bottom-right corner of the comment box. Doing so will post your comment; the time stamp will appear as a blue link.

, Is it crucial to the plot? Do you have a good enough reason? Are you just getting rid of this person because they are starting to irk you? If the latter is the case, then take into account that this is not a good enough reason. Try to figure out a plot reason.
 This needs to be decided well in advance. If you do not know how this would work, then look it up. No details here, but things that you're unsure of can be easily found on the net.
 Don't kill people too early in, unless it is essential. Lots of deaths in the beginning turn some people off. On the other hand, this can warn the reader if your book is bloody or dark.
 Will people be there to witness it? Will people only find out after it happens? How will the other characters take this?

, Think of what genre you are writing, and whether you want to describe the death happening. If you're writing drama or horror, then detail is only expected. However, don't over-do it. We seriously do not need to know that much. Too much gore is a major turn off for many.
 This does not necessarily include the whole story, just anything that pertains to it. If you want to write the part where they are catching butterflies in the beginning of the book. Edit the book. Whatever. Just try to forget about it.
, This is important, especially if the person knows the plot or has been with your story from the beginning. If they're crying (this is, of course, relative. If these friends has never cried in your presence or cried during Ella Enchanted, find different friends to read it), then go with it. You've done well. If not, ask them what you can change.

 People with narcissism like to show their superiority by treating those they see as weak or inferior with disdain. When you talk about other people, either specific individuals or more impersonal groups like “the poor” or “cancer patients,” see how they respond. A person with narcissism will find a way to hint, or outright say, how he doesn’t have those problems because of something he does better.Some people with narcissism will even find pleasure in other people’s discomfort. This isn’t because they take pleasure in misfortune, but rather because it reinforces their own sense of superiority because these troubles don’t affect them.
 Nobody likes receiving criticism, of course, but people with narcissism cannot stand it. They are hyper-sensitive to the suggestion that they aren’t as great or wise as they want you to believe. Because they tend to be insecure, people with narcissism may lash out at you or become severely depressed in response to criticism.A person with narcissism may not always lash out at you. Instead, the person might offer excuses, mentioning outside forces that made their success impossible. Sometimes they can tend towards conspiracy theories, ideas that someone else “has it out for me.”

, Someone who lashes out at you if you challenge him or her may have narcissistic tendencies. A person with narcissism does not like weakness, especially in themselves, and will likely lash out at someone who challenges them and the things they say. Their goal will be to shame, guilt, or intimidate you into silence, which they can interpret at acceptance of their viewpoints.Avoid challenging a person with narcissism. The result might be confrontational or even violent.

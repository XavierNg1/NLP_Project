 Throw a bean bag inside, so you have a comfy place to decode secret messages. Use pillows or blankets if you don’t have room for a bean bag. Find a small table or stack books to set things on, like flashlights or walkie talkies.
 No matter how secret of a fort you make, you will want to be sure it is secure while you’re away. Use a padlock on the front door of a fort that is in an old shed.
 If you have a tent, it should have a screen. Make a peephole by cutting a hole through cardboard. Ask someone older to help if you want to drill a hole through wood. Cover it with a flap of sturdy fabric, like leather. Lift the flap to spy on possible intruders or let in spy mates., Use a shoe box or an empty milk carton to make a periscope. It will help you secretly peak around corners or over the walls of your fort. This will be especially handy in an underground fort made in a ditch.

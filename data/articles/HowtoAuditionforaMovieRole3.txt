 Taking classes and practicing your craft as often as possible will increase the chances that you'll impress a casting director. Take feedback from auditions into account and work as hard as you can to improve, then try again. It might take dozens of auditions before you land a role, but every time you act in front of a casting director, you're getting valuable practice.
 You can single yourself out from the other actors by demonstrating your other talents if they are relevant for the role. Knowing how to sing, dance, play an instrument, play a sport, and so on can give you an edge. Don't be afraid to break into song during an audition if you think it will help your chances.
 A talent agent would be responsible for finding roles suitable for your style and experience level, eliminating the need for you to track down roles on your own. Casting directors often send talent agents descriptions of the type of actor they're looking for, and talent agents then notify the casting directors if they're representing someone who would be a good fit. Working with a talent agent is a good way to get an "in" after you've gotten some experience under your belt.


If you go this route, be sure you're working with an experienced, licensed agent. Some people pose as talent agents to prey on vulnerable young actors. You can expect to pay your agent 10% of your earnings.
You can find an agent by attending a casting workshop, during which you would audition in front of both agents and casting directors. Do an online search for workshops in your area.

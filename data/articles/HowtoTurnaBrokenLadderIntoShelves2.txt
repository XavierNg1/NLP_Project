 Some ladders can be unhooked without a tool, whereas others might require the use of a screwdriver (an electric one is probably easiest). For the purposes of this project, you'll only be using one side of the ladder but nothing prevents you from turning both sides into wall-leaning shelves; simply do the same things to both sides.
 If it's a wooden ladder, it needs to be sanded to remove splinters and rough patches. Wood or super glue can be used to mend minor damage or dents.


Use a mild dish detergent and water to clean ladder.
 As noted earlier, if the rungs are damaged, you'll need to decide which need fixing and/or replacing and which can be left alone.

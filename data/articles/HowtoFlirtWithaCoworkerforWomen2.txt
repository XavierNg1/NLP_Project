 Eye contact is one of the primary tactics of flirtation. Brief glances can show your attraction and interest in another person.You can try looking across the room during a meeting or glancing across the table at lunch. Meet their eyes briefly before glancing down and away.
 Smiling is an open and friendly act that invites people to interact with you. In fact, smiling may be one of the best ways to meet new people and start new relationships.As your coworker passes your desk, glance up briefly and smile. If you catch their eye in a meeting, give them a quick grin. Don’t linger. A small smile is all it takes.
 When you know they are looking at you, try to casually flip your hair to show off your neck. This shows the curve of your neck while drawing attention to your hair.This is a casual but flirty move that makes it seem as though you are not deliberately trying to catch their attention.
 Leaning or orienting yourself towards another person signals that you are interested in them.You can practice this while working on a project with your coworker. Lean over the desk to point out something. Reach out so that your arm is crossing their body without touching them. If you’re working on a shared computer, shift your body so that your feet and shoulders are tilted towards them.
 While gently touching someone is often a form of flirting, it can get you in trouble in the workplace. Try to use body language that does not involve physical contact. If your touching is unwanted, you can get in trouble for harassment.

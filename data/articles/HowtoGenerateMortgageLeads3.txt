 Set up a personal website that will generate mortgage leads for you. Post ads in print and web classifieds, place signs along street-sides and take out advertisements in newspapers as well as local trade publications.


Use the amazing power of the internet to advertise your service. Online mortgage forums, email marketing, pay-per-click, and banners are all lead generating. Be sure to include a call-to-action message such as "Message us with any questions about mortgages you may have" in order to drive more demand.
 This is an effective way to gain familiarity in the home-shopping crowd and generate mortgage leads.
 Obtain a list of property owners and their addresses from the county property appraiser's office.
 Set up a booth at any type of trade show and advertise your service, making sure to target your marketing to the theme of the tradeshow. For example, at a home improvement tradeshow, you may advertise home equity lines that will allow visitors to cash out on their home's equity in order to invest in any new home additions they're interested in.

 Preheat the oven to 350° Fahrenheit (176° Celsius). Grease and flour a 9 inch round cake pan., In a large bowl whisk the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix until the dry ingredients are well-combined and folded in., In a medium-sized bowl cream the melted butter, sugar, and strawberry puree until the mixture is slightly liquid-like and resembles a bright red color., Fold in the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and blend on medium speed for about two minutes, until the cake batter resembles a bright pink color and is creamy. There should be no more flour streaks., Using a rubber spatula, scrape out the strawberry cake batter and pour it into the cake pan. Scrape the edges of the bowl to remove any excess cake batter off the sides., Place the cake pan in the oven and have the cake bake for about 35-45 minutes, until it rises and the edges are slightly brown. To test if the cake is done, poke a toothpick in the middle of the cake. If the toothpick comes out dry the cake is ready to be removed from the heat., Flip the cake pan on a wire rack. Leave the cake to cool for about 10 minutes, until cool enough to handle and frost., Consider frosting the cake with strawberry frosting, cream cheese frosting, or vanilla frosting. Decorate with sprinkles, extra strawberries, cherries, coconut flakes, and/or fondant flowers., Slice a piece of strawberry cake and lay it on a serving plate. Serve with a glass of milk if desired. Enjoy!

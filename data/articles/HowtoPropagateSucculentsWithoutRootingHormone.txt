Make sure it is not mushy and half decomposed.
Look under succulent plants for fallen leaves.
Wiggle and pull one off a plant if there are none on the ground.;
,

If using a container, the lid does not need to be used.


If the soil is already moist, add a little bit of water.
If the soil is dry, make sure it is moist before planting.
,

Rainwater or tap water is good for watering.


If the planting container is in a spot with some sunlight, that's ok; just make sure the sunlight isn't too strong or the propagated succulent could get sunburned and die.
 Spray the soil whenever it's dry., Succulents grow at their own pace, but some will root really quickly.

The roots are pinkish and like to stick out in many directions.
 Sometimes succulents will grow a baby sprout before growing roots

Just wait until roots appear to plant.
If you get a baby sprout first, that means that you are watering it just right.


Use the spray bottle to gently mist.


Eventually, the leaf that succulent grew from will die and fall off.
Do not remove the lea; you can risk tearing off roots.
Instead, wait for the leaf to fall off then remove.
, The succulent is ready to transplant when:

The "mother leaf" or leaf the succulent grew from has fallen off.
When you gently move the succulent is stays secure in the ground.
The succulent has an elongated stem with a baby sprout on top.


It's ok to accidentally break roots; the succulent will grow more roots to replace.


Make sure the location is shady, for example under a succulent already growing.
Cover the hole burying everything but still exposing the baby sprout.

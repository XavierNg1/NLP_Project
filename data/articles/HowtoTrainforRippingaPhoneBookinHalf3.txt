 Sporting goods and weightlifting stores have this item. Apply the chalk on your hands to keep them dry if you are dripping with perspiration or just got through washing your car.
 Stand up, bend your knees slightly and bend over at the waist a bit. Have your back comfortably straight and your lungs inflated (do not hold your breath). Use easy breathing exercises (the general warm-up inflates your ribcage which is the base for your upper body muscles). Breathing exercises correct the posture and prevent slouching.


Remember to exhale when applying force.
 Keep your fingers together––there should be no space between them. Your forefingers are supported by the other three fingers on each hand.


Focus your strength on the initial break and especially with respect to your grip. Gripping the phone book for too long a time will sap your energy, so grip the book hard just prior to the explosive start.
 Tweak your technique as needed.
 In maximum poundage lifting, lifters will do as little as one repetition for a set and take a lengthy rest between sets. The nervous system has to recover before doing another intense effort. Before even attempting to do a rip, gripping the book hard for any length of time is a source of great energy leakage in itself.


For fitness and exercise - rest a minute or several minutes between efforts and with book thicknesses that are moderately difficult.
For power - rest as much as 15 - 20 minutes between efforts. Between efforts, stay warm and keep focused.
 Include phone book ripping as a grip exercise and short-term diversion. It's not something you'll be able to do long-term, especially since phone books are not always available and they should be recycled.


Train like you would train any other lift - train intensely, rest several days (or even a couple weeks), train intensely, repeat.
Have a complete program of: strength training, running, aerobics - if you have a sedentary job, flexibility exercises and some agility exercises.

, Ask your child why he/she thinks there is a monster in the room. What is the monster doing? What does this monster look like? Is it a boy monster or a girl monster? This will help ease the fear as your child is describing it as a story.
 Of course, there's no monster in the room, but its presence is very real to your child.
 The kitchen is the most comforting room in your home.(Taking your child into bed with you is not a good solution. This can get to be a habit hard to break.)

, Instruct your child to enjoy the snack while you go into the bedroom and eliminate the "monster". (See "Warnings".)

, Let your child know that "Monster Spray" always works. (See "Things you will need").
 The room will have a fresh, comforting fragrance. (And monsters hate it!)

, Check all areas where monsters had been hiding.
 Maybe tell a quick story or sing the child's favorite song. If necessary, briefly lie down with your child until he/she is secure that all monsters, alligators and other scary things have vanished. (Or until he/she nods off to sleep.)

, Try putting on your child's favorite cartoon movie (as long as it's not a scary one, and it's age appropriate.) A happy cartoon will give them happy thoughts,(thus erasing the scary ones) helping them to relax and fall asleep. let them watch till they fall asleep.
 This essentially nips the problem in the bud.

Projecting positivity can help make you feel happier. It feels good to share in the joy of others, and you may find the positive feeling alone makes it worth the effort.
 If you have trouble overcoming feelings of jealousy when you see others succeed, it may be because you are under representing your own accomplishments, successes or possessions in your mind.


Make a list of all the things you have that you should be grateful for.
Review the list from time to time and add to it when you can.
Think of your list whenever you feel the urge to be jealous of someone else.

 The acidity of the white vinegar will help to remove the rust from your razor blade. The sea salt will act as an abrasive ingredient that aids the vinegar in removing the rust.


Regular table salt is fine to use, as well, but the sea salt provides a little more grit for the scrubbing.
Have a few soft, clean towels on hand, along with rubbing alcohol and a few cotton balls for sterilization.;
, You don’t need to use soap, bleach or any other cleaners for this. Never use harsh chemicals. Simply rinse the razor blade with plain water straight from the tap. The temperature of the water doesn’t matter.


If you’re cleaning a shaving razor, be sure to turn it upside down and allow the water to run through the slots between the blades.
 You can leave it in the vinegar several minutes if you like, especially if you are dealing with very stubborn rust.


Make sure you’ve used enough vinegar so that the razor blade is completely submerged in it.
 Pour a small amount of vinegar over it. Use a spoon to mix the two substances together until a thick paste forms.
 Dip the toothbrush into the paste, making sure to load the bristles with plenty of it. Scrub the blade thoroughly. Reload the brush with more paste if necessary.
 Then run the blade under the tap, rinsing it clean of any remaining paste. Inspect the razor closely to make sure the rust is gone.


Don’t leave any rust behind, since it can spread.
Repeat the steps if any rust is stubbornly remaining behind.
 Once your blade is rust-free, gently blot it on a towel to remove any moisture, which is one of the major causes of rust forming in the first place. Soak a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol and wipe the blade. This will accelerate the drying of any residual moisture and sterilize it for future use.


Leave the blade to air dry on a clean towel.
Store the blade away from moisture. If possible, store it somewhere other than the steam and humidity of the bathroom.Always blot the blade dry after using it.

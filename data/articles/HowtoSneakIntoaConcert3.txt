 The less attention you draw to yourself the better.If possible, pick up attire similar to what the crew is dressed in so you look like you belong.
 If you start freaking out and talking about how excited you are to see the band, people will begin to catch on. Play it cool. You can try to look busy or bored. If you want to fit in, it should seem like it's just another day at the office for you.


Talk like you belong. If a crew member walks by, casually say hello. A simple nod works well, too. Don't overdo it and end up drawing their attention. If they stop you and question you, laugh it off. Then tell them you work at the venue, or you're with the band.
Make eye contact. Don't hang your head down or try to stay unnoticed. The more you act like you aren't doing anything wrong, the better the chance you have.
 Don't stop or slow down too much. Keep moving like you know where you're going, even if you don't. Watch where the staff and band members go and observe what they do. Pick up on it and follow like you belong there. By watching enough people, you'll figure out how to blend in and seem inconspicuous.

 This formula calls for two ingredients – hibiscus tea and purified water. Additionally, you’ll need a clean spray bottle that will hold 2 cups (16 fluid ounces) of the completed formula. This lightening spray will give you warm, red highlights and works best for those with red, light brown or medium brown hair.The exact recipe is:


1 cup dried hibiscus flowers or 3-5 bags of hibiscus tea;
2 cups purified water;
1 pinch of paprika (optional).
 Measure out 2 cups of purified water and boil it on the stove in a saucepan. Turn off the heat once the water has reached the boiling point. Once the water stops boiling, it will be steaming and ready for the next step., Allow the tea to steep for approximately 5-10 minutes. Keep in mind that the longer you steep the hibiscus, the stronger the solution will be.


After steeping, strain the hibiscus flowers or tea bags out of the water.
If you are using the optional paprika, add a pinch of it to the hibiscus water after straining and stir it well.
 Be sure to allow the water to cool completely first. Use a clean, empty spray bottle. A funnel might help you transfer the tea into the bottle more easily.


Once you’ve poured the formula into the bottle, replace the nozzle tightly to close it.
 You can spray it evenly all over your hair or, if you prefer targeted highlights, concentrate the spray on those individual sections of hair.


Run a comb through your hair to make sure the formula is evenly distributed.
 Allow your hair to air dry completely. After an hour has passed, rinse the solution from your hair. Shampoo and style your hair as you normally would.


This formula is not drying, unlike the lightening solutions that contain lemon juice., It will be good to use for approximately one week. After 7 days, throw the solution out and make a new batch if you want to continue adding additional warm, red highlights to your hair.

 WinRar is a file compressor that lets you make a 14Mb map file about 4 Mb. Find it here.;
, This file is also known as the HMT (Halo Mapping Tool), and was written by MonoxideC, a famous Halo modder., Sparkedit, written by Grenadiac, lets you open a Halo map file and move things like rocks, trees and vehicles. Find SparkEdit here.
 PPF-o-matic is a helper application for SparkEdit.
 This utility allows you to save the changes between a modded map and the original map, making the file size very small.,,, These will allow you to open the trial maps in SparkEdit. To use them, download PPF-o-matic and patch "sparkify" onto "bloodgulch.map". When you're done modding it, just patch the "undo sparkify" onto the map. Find the patches here. If you're playing the full version of Halo, you don't need the patch.

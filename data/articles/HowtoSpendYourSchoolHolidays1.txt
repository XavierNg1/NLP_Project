 Use your break to catch up on all those things that you could not find time for during school. Use your time to catch up on laundry, or cleaning your room. You don't want to waste precious time every day looking for some clean clothes to wear, or trying to find your phone or keys in a messy room. It may not be the most fun you'll have all summer, but getting it out of the way first can make for a great start., Think big. List all the things you have been wishing you had the opportunity to try, then spend your holiday making them happen. Having a list handy will provide you with lots of ideas. You won't waste your summer days sitting around trying to think of something to do. Just find something on your list to check off.
 Keep the people that matter to you in mind. You donâ€™t want to keep yourself so busy that you have no time to catch up with them. Set aside time that is just for being with family or friends and make the most of it.
 With work, family and friends, keeping track of your summer activities can be overwhelming. Make a calendar so you can fill your days with fun without overdoing it.
 Summer is a good time to earn extra money. The biggest mistake students make is spending it all on their holiday and going back to school broke. Be sure to limit your activities to what you can afford so you head back to school in good financial shape. You don't want to begin the new school year while you are stressed out about money.

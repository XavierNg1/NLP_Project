 Clay masks work by pulling out the substances that clog pores as they dry. They are available at health and beauty stores, but you can also make your own.


Mix 1 tablespoon of bentonite clay (available at health food stores), 1 tablespoon of water, and 1 tablespoon of oatmeal.
Apply the mixture to a clean face, making sure to cover all the areas where your pores are clogged.
Let the mask sit on your face for 10 minutes. You'll feel it start to tighten as it dries, and that means the clay is working to draw out the debris from your pores.
Wash your face with water, pat it dry with a soft towel, and apply moisturizer.
 These are known as chemical exfoliants. They are available for purchase from beauty stores, and they exfoliate your skin without you having to scrub it.


Starting with a clean face, apply the product and allow it to sit for fifteen minutes, or the time specified on the package. Don't leave it on for too long or it could irritate your skin.
Rinse your face with water, pat it dry with a soft towel, and apply moisturizer.

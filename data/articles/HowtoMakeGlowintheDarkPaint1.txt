 You can find glow in the dark, or phosphorescent, powders online or at some craft and art supply stores.









The powders come in a variety of colors and particle sizes. Larger particles are brighter, but also make a rougher paint which can create a speckled look. Smaller particles create a smoother paint, but don't glow as brightly.;
, This will be the actual paint that you mix into the phosphorescent powder. If you want your paint to be invisible in light, choose a clear paint, such as an acrylic gel. If you want to see the paint in the light, choose an acrylic or tempera paint in a color you like.









Make sure that your paint medium works with your phosphorescent powder. For example, if you are planning to use a water-based medium, then you will need "coated glow powder" also known as "coated phosphorescent pigment". For solvent or oil-based mediums, you can use standard or uncollated glow powder.
 You'll want to place 1 part powder to 5 parts paint (or 20% by volume of glow powder to paint medium).
 Gradually pour your paint medium over the powder in your bowl. Carefully stir the mixture. You can add more paint to achieve a thinner consistency.









The powder will not dissolve in the paint, so just stir until the mixture is combined and no lumps remain.
 Most glow in the dark paints should be used immediately. Depending on your powder/medium combination, your new mix may or may not have shelf life. Therefore only mix what you can use within an hour.









If you do want to store your paint, pour it into a sealable container and be sure to stir it well before using it again.

 It is important to have different options for the meals and snacks to give your child variety and introduce new foods. Children are getting used to different tastes and textures, so by exposing children to more food variety they will become accustomed to different tastes and textures.


It may help to get your child involved with the planning since most children like to exert some control over their life and eating is one area in which they tend to do it often. You could show them pictures of different foods and ask if they would like to try them. You could also find ways to work new ingredients into their favorite foods, like adding cauliflower to macaroni and cheese (since cauliflower is white, it blends well with the macaroni and cheese and could be a good way to introduce that flavor and texture into their diet).
 Feeding your child a balanced diet does not mean everything has to be homemade, but you will want to pay attention to the labels on packaged food.


For instance, your child enjoys chicken nuggets so you buy frozen chicken nuggets to meet the protein requirement. When you read the label, you realize the chicken nuggets have more than just chicken in them; they have soy protein, gluten, and sodium phosphate added to them. Although these items are not bad for your child, they are not that good for your child either. These ingredients help fill your child up without giving them the proper protein and nutrition they need.
Reading nutrition labels will help you identify all the other frozen options available. Giving yourself time to familiarize yourself with food labels will make it easier to identify which packaged food to serve your child and shopping will start to become easier.

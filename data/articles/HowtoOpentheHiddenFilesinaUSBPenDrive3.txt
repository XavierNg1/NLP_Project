 Like OS X, hidden files in Linux have a "." at the beginning of the filename. If you are using a graphical file manager such as Thunar, Nautilus, or Dolphin, you can display hidden files by clicking the View menu and selecting "Show Hidden Files".


In Thunar and Nautilus, you can press Ctrl + H to toggle this.
In Dolphin, you can press Alt + . to toggle this.
 If you are using the Terminal to navigate your files, you can display all of the hidden files in a directory (such as your USB drive) by modifying the ls command.


Type ls -a | less and press Enter when you are in the directory you want to browse. You can page through multiple results using the Up and Down keys.

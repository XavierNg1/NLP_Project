 For this version of pickled pork you will make a pickling liquid which the pork will be submerged in for 3 days. Because it takes so long, be sure that you are making it far enough ahead of time.


The equipment you will need are a large pot, a large plastic zip-lock bag, and a bowl to place under the zip lock bag.
In addition to several pounds of pork (boneless pork butt works well for this) you will need 1 quart of white vinegar, a tablespoon of salt, a dozen peppercorns, and a variety of other spices. Adding a tablespoon of celery seeds, a few whole garlic cloves, or a couple bay leaves adds a nice flavor to the meat., Cook for just a few minutes over low heat to release the flavor of the spices into the liquid. Take the liquid off the heat.
 Unlike in the quick method, no heat will be applied to the pork.


While you are letting the pickling liquid cool, it is a good time to prepare the pork. Cut the pork you purchased into 2 inch chunks, removing most of the fat if there is a lot still attached to the pork.
 Add the pork pieces to the pickling liquid. Make sure that all of the pork is submerged in the pickling liquid.


When sealing up the zip-lock bag be sure to get as much air out of the bag as possible. This will make sure that none of the pork is exposed to air, which can lead to the exposed areas spoiling.
, Although the pork is pickled, and thus preserved, the pork does still need to be cooked over some kind of heat.


This version of pickled pork is used often in red beans and rice in New Orleans, where it is often called "pickle meat."Simply add the pickled pork to the beans in the early phase of cooking them, as one would do with bacon.This variation of pickled pork can also be added to a variety of greens, such as collards, while stewing them., While it is preserved to some degree, freezing any leftovers will allow it to stay good for much longer.

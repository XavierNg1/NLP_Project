 If your iPod is disabled, the only way to unlock it is to completely erase and reset it. If you have a backup, you'll be able to restore it, otherwise you'll lose all of your data. There is no way to unlock a disabled iPod unless you use the correct passcode or you erase it.If you don't have a computer with iTunes, see the next section for instructions on resetting your iPod using the iCloud website.;
, You should see your iPod listed at the top of the screen.


If you are asked for a passcode after connecting your iPod to your computer, or you've never synced your iPod with iTunes on your computer before, see the Using Recovery Mode section below.
 This will allow you to restore your data after you reset your iPod.


Make sure "This Computer" is selected to create a complete local backup.
 This will likely take a few minutes to complete. Once the reset process is complete, you'll be taken through the iPod's initial setup process.
 This will load the backup that you created so that all of your data is restored.

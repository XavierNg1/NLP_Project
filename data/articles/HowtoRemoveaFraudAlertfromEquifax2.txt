 Different types of fraud alerts stay on your credit report for different lengths of time.


An initial fraud alert expires after 90 days, and requires creditors to use reasonable procedures to verify your identity before taking an action such as opening a new credit account, issuing a new credit card, or increasing your credit limit.An extended fraud alert requires an identity theft report showing that you have been a victim of identity theft. Creditors must verify your identity by calling the phone number you've provided to Equifax. Extended fraud alerts stay on your credit report for seven years.If you've purchased an Equifax credit monitoring product, you may have an automatic alerts feature that automatically renews your initial fraud alert for an additional 90 days when it expires., Working from the date the fraud alert appeared on your credit report, you can calculate the day when it will expire.


If you've purchased a credit monitoring product from Equifax, you can check the alerts under the Member Center on your account to find out the exact date when your alert expires.
 If the expiration date isn't too long from the current date, you can remove the alert by letting it fall off on its own.Given that alerts can only be removed by mailing a written request to Equifax, if your alert is set to expire within the next few weeks, you may be better served to simply let it expire on its own., After the expiration date has passed, look at your credit report and make sure the fraud alert is no longer there.


If the fraud alert remains on your report after the expiration date has passed, call the number for Equifax listed on your credit report to speak directly to an agent, or use Equifax's online contact form to send an email.

 If you're converting dollars to euros, for example, you'll need to know how many euros equal a dollar.
 Open a web browser and type to into the address bar. Doing so will bring up a box at the top of the search engine that displays how many of the second currency equal the first currency.

For example: typing "dollars to rubles" into Google brings up a box that shows that one US dollar is equal to 60.77 Russian rubles.
 It's a green app with a white "X" on it.

If you have an existing document you'd like to open instead, double-click it.
 You'll find this option in the upper-left side of the window.

On Mac, click the New tab and then click Blank Workbook.
 Generally, you'll place the currency values you already know in one column (e.g., "A") and leave the next column blank for the currency you're converting to.

If you opened a spreadsheet with data already in place, skip this step.
 This is the number that you looked up earlier. Make sure you plug this number into a cell in a column that you aren't using.

If you were converting dollars to rubles as in the previous example, the currency conversion rate would be "60.77".
 The conversion formula is =*$$. For example:

With US dollar values in the "A" column starting at A1, rubles planned for the "B" column starting at B1, and the conversion rate in cell C1, you would type =A1*$C$1 into cell B1.
 This will enter your formula into the top cell of the second currency's column, which will display the converted value in this cell., Click and drag the top cell in the converted currency's column down until it matches the last full cell in the first currency's column, then release the mouse button. Each cell in the second currency's column should now display the converted version of the first currency column's cells.

For the previous example, you would click and drag B1 down until it lined up with the last cell containing a dollar value in the "A" column.

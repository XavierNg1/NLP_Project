 "OK," you say, "I have a scanner. Can't I just plop my slide onto the scanner bed, and do it that way? Of course, you can: but the problem is that the slides are very small.


You can check to see if there is an adapter available as an accessory to allow you to mount your slides into a mount holder and scan using your flatbed. This should provide you an opportunity to preview and save very easily, if not very quickly. If an adapter is not available you can make one using some household materials (e.g. paper, tape, etc.) see www.abstractconcreteworks.com/essays/scanning/backlighter.html. Scanning on a flatbed has inherent limitations in lighting and resolution, and will not generally give you a similar quality image to a digital photograph nor a professionally scanned slide.

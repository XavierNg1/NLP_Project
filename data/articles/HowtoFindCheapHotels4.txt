 Tell the hotel what price you are looking for. Suggest that you want to check if they want to offer a deal before you try places down the road.Unless there is a strict no-discounts policy, most hotel managers will be flexible and give you the rate available on Hotels.com or another site.
If they won’t offer you a discount, ask if they will give you free services like a breakfast or Internet.
 Say that you are a representative of your company looking to book a group of rooms at a hotel in the area. They may call you out or they may give you an industry rate of 10 to 15 percent off or more.


You should also ask for an educator discount, military discount or a non-profit discount if you are associated with a school, charity or branch of military service., Search according to the hotel name at Retail Me Not, Coupons.com or Coupon Heaven. If they don’t have a discount code, they may have coupons for free Internet or services.
 Europe in the fall or winter and South America or the Caribbean in the summer will have far lower rates than in the high season.
 If you are up for adventure and a little risk, wait for hotels with unbooked rooms to offer discounts. Remember that you must ask or they will charge you the standard rate.


Leave your luggage in the car when you ask for discounts or haggle. You send the message that you are going to stay at the hotel if you bring your suitcase with you.

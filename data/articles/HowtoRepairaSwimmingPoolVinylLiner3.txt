 A common problem with pool liners is that small holes or tears can develop from impact damage or sharp debris in the pool.









Use a vinyl patch kit specifically made for swimming pools.
Cut the patch into a circle, as sharp edges on the patch will tend to peel off over time.
If possible, use a piece of the same liner pattern for a color match or place the patch on the underside of the liner.

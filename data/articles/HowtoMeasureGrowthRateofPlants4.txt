 Dry measurements will kill your plant, so you should only do this type of measurement if you have multiple specimens. Choose a random plant, and remove it from its pot. Leave the other plants alone.
 With a gentle stream of water, rinse dirt from the plant. You can use your fingers to gently remove clumps. Pat it dry with a paper towel.
 A drying oven is ideal. Set the temperature to 140∘{\displaystyle ^{\circ }} Fahrenheit or 60-70∘{\displaystyle ^{\circ }} Celsius.  Heat the plants for at least 8 to 12 hours and up to two days to dry out the plants.If you do not have a drying oven, a food dehydrator set at the same temperature will also work.

A conventional oven with a convection setting may work as well. Set it at 140 Fahrenheit for six hours. It will dry out the plants well enough, although a little moisture may remain. Do not leave a conventional oven on overnight. 


, Pinch the zipper closed to prevent moisture from entering. This will keep the plants dry. Allow the plants to cool in the bag.

If leaves fall off during cooling, keep them. Place the detached leaves on the scale with the rest of the plant.
 When it is completely cool, place the plant on the scale. Record the weight. This particular plant is now completely destroyed. You may toss out the plant this point., You can take new measurements after a few days, but you may want to wait a week or two. Once you have the new measurements, you can compare them to the old. Use the growth rate formula to find an average change in weight.

The equation for this growth rate is (W2−W1)T{\displaystyle {\frac {(W2-W1)}{T}}}where W1=first dry weight, S2=second dry weight, and T equals the number of days between each.

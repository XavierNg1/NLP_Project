 In the 27 other states that allow UOCAVA voters to cast a ballot electronically, you will either print out your absentee ballot, scan it and email it, or print it out, scan it and fax it.Make sure that your state participates in this type of voting before you count on voting in this manner. If they don’t you might need to allot enough time to return the ballot via postal mail. A listing of participating states can be found at http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/internet-voting.aspx.
 Go to your Secretary of State’s website to request the absentee ballot. You can find a listing of the websites for the fifty secretaries of state at http://www.canivote.org/, which is maintained by the National Association of Secretaries of State.


They will either mail you a ballot through postal mail, fax you a ballot, or email you a ballot.
 Print the ballot out, complete it, and send it to the county board of elections (or registrar of voters, depending on locality) where you are registered. Send it via email or fax, depending on convenience and what your state’s laws allow.


Remember to comply with all of the rules associated with this process. Many states will require you to provide some form of identification and/or a witness’ signature along with your ballot. This will be provided with your ballot, so just make sure that you read all of the information carefully and follow the appropriate directions.

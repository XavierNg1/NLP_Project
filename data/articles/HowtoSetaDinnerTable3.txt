 This technique is especially beautiful if your napkins complement your plates. Fold the napkin into thirds lengthwise to create a long flat napkin shape. Then, place the folded napkin on top of the charger and under the plates. The colors of the napkin will contrast pleasantly against the colors of the plates.


If the napkin is too long, fold the long flat shape in half to shorten it.

Some people learn the folding technique more quickly if they can watch it done.

 A cluttered refrigerator will prevent the air from properly circulating and cooling the food that is stored. You’ll want to start by learning the best way to organize your fridge.


Empty out the fridge and clean it thoroughly.
Discard food that has spoiled.
Organize the food bins. Certain bins are designated for produce, meat, and cheese.
After filling the bins, start adding the rest of the food.
 FIFO stands for First In, First Out and is a standard practice in restaurants and commercial kitchens. When unpacking groceries at home, place older products in the front and store the new products in the back. This will ensure that you are using up the older groceries first before they spoil. , Keeping a list of what you have thrown out can serve as reminder to rethink purchasing it next time. If you didn’t use it before, perhaps you just aren’t inclined to eat that food and it will go to waste if you buy it again.
 Instead of throwing something out that you do not want to eat, consider donating food to a food bank. This will both prevent food from going to waste and allow you to help others in need.


Search online for food banks in your area. You can also ask friends or family if they know of any and can direct you.
Once you have designated a food bank in your area to donate to, look online or call to find out what kind of food they do and do not accept.
Most food banks will not accept food that has not been prepared in a kitchen that is licensed to process or prepare food.
It is generally acceptable to donate non-perishable food that is sealed or in cans that has been purchased from a store.

 Darker lipstick stands out on a face with light eyes. Bright, flashy lipstick makes an impression if you have brown or hazel eyes.
 People with dark skin can make their lips stand out with hot pink or orange-pink lipstick. People with fair skin are more noticeable with dark red lipstick, but light pink works as well.
 Keep a tube of black, purple, or green lipstick in your collection. Once in a while, you can really draw attention to yourself.
 If you especially want your lips to be the center of attention, tone down the other parts of your make-up. Keep your eye and skin makeup slight.
 For best effect, let your lips hang slightly apart. This is a sultry look with a lot more class than the "duck face." For even more of an effect, bite your lip while you look at someone â€” but take care not to smudge your lipstick.

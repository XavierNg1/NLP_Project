 Asking questions and questioning everything around us constantly is what makes us smarter. There's nothing wrong with not knowing the whys or the hows! Everybody has something that they don't know. But by developing a healthy habit about asking when you don't know something, you'll find yourself getting smarter and smarter.
 Ask yourself during each goal-setting session, how many of last week's goals did I achieve? Why didn't I accomplish some of my goals and what can I do to give myself a greater chance of success?


Constantly work hard to achieve each of your goals. Without goals, you would have nothing to hope for. Reward yourself after accomplishing your goal.

Be organized. You don't need to be a total neat freak, but wasting time is not smart. Of course, there are many geniuses who are completely disorganized (think of the absent-minded professor) but if you're making an active effort to be smart, taking a conscious approach to how you spend your time is a big step in the right direction.
 Educating yourself takes time, and if you want to get smarter it is going to require effort. Donâ€™t expect it to happen overnight. You need to spend a lot of time actively thinking and learning if you want to really be smart.
 There are many sources of information out there. For example: books, documentaries, and the internet. School is just one source of information. If you have straight A's, that doesn't mean that you are smart. Exercising an open mind will make you more intelligent and constantly learning will help you get there.

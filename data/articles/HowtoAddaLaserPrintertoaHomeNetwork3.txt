 To add a network printer directly to a home network, a physical connection to a network router or hub is required. This connection could be made using an Ethernet cable, a USB cable or a wireless connection. Refer to the documentation included with your device to determine which connection methods are available.
 Refer to the device manual for instructions on how to connect the printer to the hub or router.


Plug 1 end of the Ethernet cable into the Ethernet connection port on the printer, and plug the other end of the Ethernet port on the network router or hub when using an Ethernet connection.
Insert the square end of the USB cable into the matching port on the laser printer and the rectangular end into and empty USB port on the network router or hub when using a USB connection.
 Press the setup button on the laser printer's control panel to open the setup wizard. The name assigned to your network should appear in the list of available networks.


Enter the network name and password when prompted by the setup wizard, and click OK. A wireless connection has been established between the laser printer and the router or hub.
 Now that a physical connection between the device and the router or hub has been made, it is possible to add the laser printer to the home network.


Click Go in the Finder menu toolbar, and select Utilities from the pull-down menu.
Double-click the Printer Setup Utility option. The Printer List window will open.
Highlight the newly installed printer from the options listed in the Printer browser and click the Add button. Repeat this step for each computer on the network. The network laser printer has been added to the home network.

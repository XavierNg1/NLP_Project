, This will add a little more flavor to each bite.


You can use any seasoning you want to the chicken.
 Turn on the stove between medium and high heat. Let the oil get hot before you add your chicken.
 It should take about 10-12 minutes for the chicken to cook, depending on its size.


You can also add water to the skillet to stop the chicken from getting crispy.
 Put the 4 quarts of water in a large pot and turn the stove between medium and high heat. Wait until the water is bubbling.
 Remove the layers of papery skin. Cut the garlic vertically and horizontally. How much you use is up to you, but 2 or 3 cloves is recommended.
 It should take about 10-14 minutes to cook the noodles, depending on how firm you like your pasta.
 You can cut the chicken however you want; if in doubt, try squares about the size of a chicken bouillon cube.
 Let the butter melt; then add the garlic.
 This should take about a minute or so.
 Add the floor and evaporated milk to make to Alfredo sauce thick.
 Wait until the evaporated milk started making little bubbles. Stir thoroughly to make sure there aren't any bumps or clumps.
 Start with salt and pepper but not too much because you'll use other seasoning too. Use about 1 teaspoon of cayenne, 3 teaspoons of Cajun, and a few shakes of the red crushed peppers.


If you want just a little kick, do not use those measurements; start with less.
 Stir to make sure the sauce is spread evenly.
 You can either stir the chicken in or just leave it on top. Enjoy!

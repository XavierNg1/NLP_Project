 You can only request your DD214 records online through the Veteran Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DOD) Offices if you recently left the military or you are currently receiving veteran benefits. If you are in one of these two categories, you may be able to request your DD214 through the VA and DOD’s eBenefits website. Visit the eBenefits website at: https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits-portal/ebenefits.portal.
 In order to request your DD 214 online, you must be registered with the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System.


The easiest way to determine whether you are enrolled in DEERS is by trying to register for a DS Logon Account (discussed below). If you are unable to register for your DS logon, attempt to register with DEERS by:
Visiting the following website: https://iris.custhelp.com/app/ask.
In the question box, type “Not in DEERS.”
Next, from the drop down menu “select a topic,” select the “Veteran not in DEERS (Add)” option.
Next, from the drop down menu "Select an Inquiry Type?" select “Question.”
Provide identifying information on the form.
A VA representative will contact you within a few days.
You may also call the VA at 800-827-1000, and then choose option 1, then option 7, and then option 0, for assistance.
In order for the VA to assist you, you must be receiving VA compensation through an electronic funds transfer (EFT).
The VA will request your checking or savings account number and most recent dollar amount for your EFT in order to verify tour status., Once you are registered in DEERS, you can request your DS Logon at a VA Regional Office (VARO), which you can locate at: http://www.benefits.va.gov/benefits/offices.asp. Additionally, you can obtain your DS Logon in the following ways:


You can enter your Last Name, First Name, Date of Birth and your social security number on the online application: https://myaccess.dmdc.osd.mil/.
As an active service member, you can use your Common Access Card (CAC) to register for a DS Logon at: https://myaccess.dmdc.osd.mil/identitymanagement/registration.do?execution=e2s1

As a veteran, you can try to register online at: https://myaccess.dmdc.osd.mil/identitymanagement/registration.do?execution=e6s1. If you do not have a CAC, you will have to prove your identity by calling the VA at 800-827-1000 or visiting a local VARO office., Once you have your DS Logon, you can use that to log in to your eBenefits account. Once you access your account, you can verify, review and print documents from your Military Personnel File, including your form DD214.

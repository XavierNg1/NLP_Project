 Include activities in your lesson plan that help your child develop their fine motor skills, i.e., holding objects and hand-eye coordination. Activities that develop fine motor skills are drawing, scribbling and painting. It is also important to teach your child how to hold an object the right way, as well. Teach your child how to hold a pencil or a paintbrush in their hand.
 You can also develop your child's hand-eye coordination by cutting shapes along lines. Draw lines on colored paper for your child to follow and cut along. You can also draw circles, squares, and triangles for your child to cut.If your child is younger, use child safety scissors to cut the shapes.
 You can develop your child's fine motor skills by teaching them to kick and throw balls. This is a fun activity to do outside, and to teach your child the importance of exercise. Kick the ball back and forth with your child. You can also set up cones, similar to a soccer goal, and have your child kick the ball between the cones.
 Playtime is just as important as lesson time. Playtime offers your child an unstructured setting where they can develop a sense of independence, explore their interests, and develop confidence. Playtime also promotes creativity, which is essential for developing intellectual capacities.The amount of playtime your child gets should proportional to the amount of time your child spends learning. For example, if you have an hour of lessons planned, make sure your child gets at least 30 minutes, if not an hour, of playtime each day.

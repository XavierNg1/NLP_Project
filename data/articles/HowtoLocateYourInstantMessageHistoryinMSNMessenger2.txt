 If you think you changed the default directory for MSN chat logs but simply cannot remember where, then not all hope is lost. You can search Windows for the chat files, contained in .xml files, but the process may be a bit tedious.


XML (Extensible Markup Language) files are a format for text data. Like HTML, they can be read with a web browser, but the format is more flexible with how the data can be applied between applications. They can also be opened in a text editor, but the data will likely read more smoothly from a web browser.
 Go to Start > Search and enter the search term XML and begin the search.
 You get many results for XML files, but you can make things a little easier by the looking at the filepath for each listed result. Look for a filepath that seems like where you might have saved the chat logs. With a little luck and some persistence, you can find the chat logs youâ€™re looking for!

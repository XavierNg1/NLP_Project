 Heat a cup of water to a boil and while it simmers, line the bottom of the bowl with a layer of aluminum foil, shiny side facing up. Avoid using this method if your sterling is antiquated or includes jewels. Add a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of baking soda to the foil in the bowl., Try to pour the vinegar in slowly to accommodate for the fizz that will happen. Mix everything together until the dry ingredients have completely dissolved., Allow the water to combine with the mixture. Gently drop your silver jewelry pieces into the bowl one by one.Flip the pieces over periodically with tongs so that both sides of the jewelry are exposed to the foil.
 Gently buff the silver with a polishing cloth. Hold it up to the light to see if the tarnish is noticeably gone from the silver.If it is, itâ€™s all cleaned! If not, back to the foil bowl.

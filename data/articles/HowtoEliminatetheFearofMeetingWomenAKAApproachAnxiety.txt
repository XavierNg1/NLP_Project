 You will hopefully uncover the beliefs that are generating these emotions.

One example of a such a technique that will help you eliminate anxiety:

"Joye Pete Technique"

Think of a situation when you want to meet and talk with a beautiful girl. Choose one that makes you feel anxious. Imagine the scene as real, as it happens right now. Hold the image and the feeling and even make it worse. You can make it worse by imagining that the outcome of the interaction gets even worse.
Inhale part way. If you are of an average lung capacity take around half filled with air and hold it. If you are an athlete fill around 25% of your lung capacity.
After a few moments (4 to 15 seconds on average) you will begin to feel stressed by holding your breath.
Let the panic and stress come! It's getting more and more stressful.
Let it build up!
Hold it as long as you can. When it gets too much: slowly and calmly let the air out and gently exhale. Exhale softly and in a relaxed controlled fashion. (This is key! Do not let it in a gasp at once and do not gulp for air after you finish). Immediately, smile big.
Breath normal and keep smiling for 20 seconds or more.
How do you feel now?





, Try to access the same feeling.
 Do you feel as anxious as before?(Some of the people feel good, others less anxious and other people don't feel anything because they completely eliminated the negative feeling.)

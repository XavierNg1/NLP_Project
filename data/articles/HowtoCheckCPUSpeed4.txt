 This is a freeware utility that monitors the components in your computer. It is designed for overclockers, and will report the exact speed that your processors are operating at. You can download it from cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html.CPU-Z will not install any adware or toolbars during the setup process.
 By default, there will be a shortcut on your desktop to start CPU-Z. You will need to be logged in as an administrator, or have the administrator password in order to run it.
 Your processor will automatically slow down when it isn't being used, so the speeds you see in CPU-Z will not show the full speed unless your processor is working hard.A quick way to get your CPU maxed-out is to run the Prime95 program. this is a program designed to calculate prime numbers, and is used by many to perform stress tests on a computer. Download Prime95 from mersenne.org/download/, unzip the program files, and select "Just Stress Testing" when you run the program.
 Your current CPU speed will be displayed in the "Core Speed" field of the CPU tab. Expect to see minor fluctuations as your computer processes the Prime95 program.

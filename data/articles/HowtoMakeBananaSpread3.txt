 Cut the avocado into chunks.
 Pour in the lemon juice.
 It can be used now, or, if you're not using it for raw food purposes, do the following:


Place the puree into a saucepan
Bring to a boil, then turn down to low and simmer.
Stir frequently. It's ready when it thickens to a consistency you like.
Allow to cool before using.
 As above, this can be used as a sandwich filler, cracker spread or used as a cake filling.

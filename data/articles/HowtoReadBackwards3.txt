 If you're trying to decipher text that has been written backward in mirror image, there's an easy way to make it legible. The mirror image of the text, or the image of the text that you'll see in the mirror, will look as though it was written normally.


Mirror image writing is different from right to left backwards writing. In mirror image writing, each individual letter appears backwards, but the letters are still in left to right order.
You can see the effect if you hold up regular text to a mirror.
 Just as you normally would, you should be able to clearly read the text now. No brain boggling is required to decipher the code. The letters will appear in their normal position.
 The next time you want to make your writing slightly more difficult to understand, you can use a mirror to translate your text into mirror image writing. Here's what to do:


Write your text on a piece of paper in normal writing.
Have a friend hold it in front of a mirror.
Use a piece of tracing paper to trace over the mirror image of your text.
The text on the tracing paper will be your message, in mirror image backwards writing.

 Microwaves have a hard time heating the small, uncooked kernels when there is popcorn in the way, which causes the popcorn to burn and the kernels to go unpopped. Remove the popcorn, then return the kernels to the microwave for an extra minute.
 You can cook any kernels in the microwave by placing 1/4 cup of plain popcorn kernels in a paper bag. Add some salt and 2 teaspoons of olive oil to taste. Fold the bag over 2-3 times and staple it shut, then cook for 2:30 minutes.


Make sure you leave room for the popcorn-- it will expand as it cooks.
 Popcorn kernels have a small amount of moisture in them that literally explodes when it gets hot enough, creating popcorn. However, if the popcorn is heated slowly then the moisture simply escapes through the kernel, making it impossible to pop. If you've cooked the kernels for 3-4 minutes and they still don't pop, stop and throw them away., For the most part, this setting is guessing how to cook the popcorn. You should always listen in to the popcorn as it cooks -- if there are long pauses between "pops" or the smell of smoke, stop the microwave immediately.

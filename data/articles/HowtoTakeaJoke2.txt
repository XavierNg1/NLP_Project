 Recognize we all go a little too far sometimes, and let miner offenses go. If a friend gets caught up in the moment and makes a disparaging comment, forgive him. Decide it was a mistake, assume he's sorry for having said it, and expect him to meet all other duties as a friend with compassion and empathy.If inappropriate comments or mean spirited jokes continue to be a problem, then you might consider addressing the issue with your friend.
 There are a few scenarios where this response might be appropriate, such as at school when those making the jokes don't know you well, or don't realize they're annoying you. At times, if you can show yourself to be a gracious good sport, you can win respect from those making the comments, and make new friends out of the deal.For example, if someone spills water on you and someone asks "Going for a swim?" you can say, "Darn, and I left my beach towel at home!"

, What constitutes humor varies wildly. Our physical maturation, emotional states, and personal circumstances all contribute to what we consider our sense of humor. Accept yours may be radically different than others.Ignoring jokes you don't find funny is an easy way to express your disapproval, without creating unnecessary tension.

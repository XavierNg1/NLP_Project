 Measure the final amount of juice you end up with after the straining process is complete. Pour it into a large, clean pot. Stir in just under a cup of sugar for every cup of juice.


If you like very sweet jelly, add a full cup of sugar for every cup of juice.
For jelly that is tangy and not too sweet, reduce the sugar by a teaspoon per cup and add a few teaspoons of lemon juice.
 Stir the mixture constantly so the sugar doesn't get stuck to the sides and bottom of the pot. Continue stirring until the sugar has completely dissolved into the juice.
 The jelly will begin producing a layer of foam on its surface as it cooks. Use a spoon to skim this off and discard it. Keep skimming off the foam until the sugar is dissolved.
 As the jelly heats, it will begin to change consistency, since quince have natural properties that cause jelling to occur. When the jelly is ready it will cool into a gelatin-like substance, rather than being runny like juice.


Check to see if the jelly is ready by spooning a bit onto a cold plate.After a few seconds, touch it. If it feels like jelly and slightly resists your touch, it's ready. If it's wet like juice, keep cooking it.
You can also determine whether the jelly is ready by checking its temperature. Use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature; the jelly should be ready when it reaches 220 °F (104 °C).

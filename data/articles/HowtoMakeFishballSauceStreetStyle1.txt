 Place 3 tablespoons of water and 3 tablespoons of cornstarch in a small bowl. Use a fork, spoon or small whisk to completely combine the water and cornstarch. The slurry will appear thin and white.


The cornstarch will help your sauce thicken and the slurry will prevent the sauce from becoming lumpy as it cooks.;
, Place 4 cups (940 ml) of water in a medium saucepan along with 3/4 cup (175 g) of brown sugar and 4 tablespoons of soy sauce. Stir the sauce until it's combined and turn the heat on to medium. Let the sauce come to a boil.Stir the sauce occasionally to help the sugar dissolve.
 Hold a whisk in one hand and whisk your sauce. Gradually pour in the cornstarch slurry with your other hand, whisking constantly. Reduce the heat to medium and continue to whisk the sauce once the slurry is completely added.You should see the sauce begin to thicken. It's important to constantly whisk or you'll end up with lumpy sauce.
 Once the sauce is as thick as you'd like it, turn the heat to low. Mince 1 small red onion, 2 small garlic cloves, and 1 siling labuyo (chili pepper). Add the onion, garlic and pepper to the sauce along with 1 teaspoon of salt and stir the sauce.You can adjust the seasonings by adding more onion, garlic, or pepper as you like.
You can refrigerate the sauce and use it within 1 week. This recipe makes around 3 cups of sauce.

 This will be your chart of accounts. You can use any coding you like, for example numbering them 001, 002, etc.; or using letters, like c01, c02 for credit card, b01, b02 for bank accounts, or whatever.
 Be as detailed or rough as you want to know it later; start rather small, and if you value the results, get more detailed. Typical lines would be 'food & drinks', 'gas & other car related', 'house related'. Simply come back here and add more lines when you find you missed something.
 Don't duplicate codes already used.
 Each transaction in your finances will be recorded in this sheet as one line. Create columns for 'date', 'description', 'amount', 'from account', and 'to account'.
 This is an ongoing process, not a one-day activity. Every evening, or latest every weekend, add the lines for all transactions. For example, if you get cash from your checking account, you would add a line like: '3/8/09 | took out cash | 200.00 $ | 100 | 120', where 100 and 120 would be the account numbers you assigned to 'bank' and 'cash'. If you shop in the supermarket, the line might be '3/9/09 | supermarket | 69.50 $ | 120 | 410', where 120 is again the account number for 'cash', and 410 is the code for 'food'.


Start calculating. Once you have some lines collected, you can make Excel do the math: for each account number, add with a formula all changes that affect it together. Whenever the account number is in the 'from' column, subtract the amount; if it is in the 'to' column, add it. For example, with the two example lines from above, the cash account would have a total of +200.00 -69.50 = +130.50, plus whatever the cash was before. You will need some more complex excel techniques for this, it is not trivial. There are many ways to do it in Excel, one option is a matrix formula, which might look something like "=SUM(IF('Log'!$E=$C2;1;IF('Log'!$D=$C2;-1;0))*'Log'$C)" - this means compare the values in column E and D of the log to the current lines code, and if they match, add the amount from column C, multiplied by 1 or -1.
The result will show the new totals for all your accounts in the inventory, and in the second part of that sheet, the cost for each line; for example the line 'food' would show the total of 69.50 $, which is what you spent for it.
If you use this process, you do not need to make a new inventory every period - it gets calculated automatically. You should check it for correctness, though; any differences mean that you forgot lines in the log.
You will be able to see your net worth changes all the time but be careful to analyze them only after some longer period. Obviously, the day you get your paycheck, your net worth jumps up, but the next days you are only spending, so it goes down again. Compare it only for corresponding days, like each time before your paycheck comes.

 Coloring your hair can actually make it look fuller and bigger. If you lighten it with bleach, the process roughs up the cuticle so it appears thicker. However, you donâ€™t have to color all over for fuller-looking hair. Adding a few highlights can help make your hair appear more voluminous.While bleaching and dyeing can make your hair look thicker, be careful not to over colour it. That can dry your hair out and lead to damage.
 If your hair is fine or thinning, incorporating foods that promote hair growth into your diet can help give you bigger hair. Look for foods that are rich in biotin, zinc, iron, and protein to support healthy hair growth so your hair becomes fuller.Tofu, kale, spinach, chard, and beans are high in biotin, zinc, and iron.
Salmon, eggs, beans, bananas, cauliflower, peanuts, and lentils are also high in biotin.
Lean red meat, chicken, seafood, eggs, nuts, beans, low-fat dairy, and whole grains are high in protein.
 Another way to encourage hair growth is to boost circulation to your scalp. Stimulate blood flow to your hair follicles by massaging it regularly. That helps promote healthy hair growth and makes your fine or thin hair appear plumper.For an effective scalp massage, spread a few drops of a lightweight hair oil, such as argan, macadamia nut, sweet almond, or coconut oil, between your fingertips and rub it into your scalp in circular motions just before you plan to wash your hair.

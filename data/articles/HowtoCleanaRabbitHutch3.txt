 Keep all waste from the rabbit cage in a garbage bag. Tie it up tightly and throw it away.
 Be sure to clean and disinfect all supplies used to clean the hutch, including the bucket, brushes and gloves.


Let these items dry thoroughly.
 Decrease the possibility of spreading germs by washing your hands thoroughly when youâ€™ve finished cleaning the cage.

 You'll need:


1.5 cups or 220 grams of raw almonds (unsalted, uncooked)
4 cups or 940 milliliters of filtered or spring water, plus water for soaking
1 vanilla bean; scoop out the seeds; alternatively, use 1/2 teaspoon vanilla essence or extract;
, Do this for at least 8 hours, up to about 12 hours. The soaking softens them well for use, but is optional. Drain the water from the almonds.
 Add the vanilla extract and continue blending until well mixed.


You may find 4 cups a little too watery; if this concerns you, try 3 to 3.5 cups and add more if needed.
 If you want to sweeten the almond milk, add rice syrup, honey or other reasonably healthy sweetener, to taste.
 This is very important or you will be drinking almond pulp as well as the milk. Using something like a very fine strainer or sieve, or several layers of cheesecloth (muslin), pour the almond milk through the filter into a large bowl underneath. The filter will retain the almond pulp and the liquid will go through.


Squeeze the remaining pulp to remove the last of the liquid. It is easier if done using a cloth; otherwise, use your very clean hands.
The almond meal left over can be dried and used to add more fiber to your diet.
 Almond milk can be kept in the refrigerator for 4-7 days, covered. It will usually need shaking before serving, to remix the liquid.
 Almond milk can be used with a range of foods where you would use dairy milk, such as for cooking, for cereals, for drinking, etc. Those who love almond milk often find drinking it is best.

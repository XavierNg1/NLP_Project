 If you want to give the bride and groom something that will help them remember their special day, a picture frame is the perfect gift. It will be a welcome addition to the newlywed’s home.


Pick a material for the frame that can signify the beauty and importance of the day such as silver, glass, or a finely polished wood.
Add a more thoughtful touch to your wedding gift and get the date of the wedding, a message of congratulations, or the couple’s names engraved onto the frame.;
, Arranging for a gift basket to be delivered to their home when they return from their honeymoon is a thoughtful wedding gift. You may not know them well, but ask someone that does what the couple’s likes and hobbies are and choose a basket based off of that.Examples of different gift basket themes include:


A picnic basket of wine, cheese and fruit.
A sweets basket complete with chocolates, dried fruit and assorted candy.
A his-and-hers spa basket containing lotions, soaps and body washes.
 Money is a great gift to give to someone you don’t know, especially if the bride and groom are planning for a big honeymoon or putting a down payment on a house. Buy a nice congratulatory card to slip the money or check inside, along with a thoughtful message.


Be aware of regional and cultural etiquette regarding wedding gifts of money. In some social circles, cash is the best gift; whereas in others, it is still considered taboo.If you know anyone going to the wedding that knows the bride or groom, ask them if they think cash or a check would be proper.
 A gift card is a good alternative to a cash gift. Try and find one for the store where the couple has their wedding registry to make the shopping easier for them.

 Add your maple syrup, whiskey, orange slices, and cherries to a sauce pan. Allow the mixture to come to a simmer over medium heat. Cook your syrup for about five minutes., You need to let the mixture steep so the flavor is absorbed. After five minutes, remove your pan from the heat. Set it aside for about 10 minutes., Use a strainer to strain out the orange slices. You can use the syrup right away. You can also transfer it to an airtight container and serve it later. It tastes good chilled as well.

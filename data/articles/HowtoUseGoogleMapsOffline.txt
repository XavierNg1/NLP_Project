 This is found at the very top of the menu. This will show places that you have saved or reviewed.
 Scroll down to the very bottom of the screen and tap "Save a new offline map.”

, Try to zoom out as far as you can. All of the info within the screen will be saved, such as road names, detailed outlines of roads, and parks. Keep on zooming out until you see a notice on the top of the screen that says "Area too large, zoom in."

, After tapping Offline Maps, you will be prompted to save the map shown on your screen. Tap the “Save” button at the bottom to save the map. Name the map with a word that will make sense to you. You can now open the map without an internet connection and zoom in to see road names, parks, etc.

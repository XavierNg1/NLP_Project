Equipment includes things like spare batteries, cameras, lenses and memory cards. Put everything in photo bags so it's ready to go in the morning.Other accessories include a flash, tripod, diffuser, and lights.;
, Have a conversation with the couple getting married so you can get a better sense of the wedding location and what they are looking for. Talk to them about your thoughts on the best locations at the wedding venue to take photos and come up with backup plans.For instance, if the bride and groom want family photos taken outdoors but the weather turns out to be bad, plan a backup location indoors that the bride and groom would be happy with.
 Going to the site of the wedding beforehand will give you insight into the best places to take photos. You can also test different camera angles and take note of how the light looks during different times of the day. Look for spaces that enhance the beauty of winter and make use of interesting architecture or beautiful, natural landscapes., The winter can be cold, and you'll need steady hands to take good photos. Make sure that you dress appropriately for the weather. It's always good to overdress rather than underdress because you can remove garments of clothing if you get too hot. Remember to wear a hat, gloves, a scarf, and heavy winter jacket if it's going to be cold outside.


Choose your outfit the night before to save time on the day of the wedding.
 Sunlight is limited during the winter, so if you want to get group or portrait photos outside, it's important that you show up early. This will also allow you the additional time to unpack your gear and get prepared and set up for the day. Do one last survey of the wedding location so you can nail down any final details of the photo shoot.

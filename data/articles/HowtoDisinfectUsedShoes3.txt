 Vinegar is known for getting stubborn odors out of things â€“ shoes included. When washing your shoes with soap and water, add a bit of vinegar to the mixture. After washing your shoes, you can also rub them down with pure white vinegar and a rag. The vinegar smell will fade, but the smelly odor will be completely eliminated., Baking soda is a great deodorizer, so it's one of the best ways to get smelly odors out of shoes. Pour 2-3 tablespoons into each shoe, and shake the shoes so that the baking powder spreads out evenly. Let the shoes sit overnight, and then pour the excess baking powder out of your shoes., Dryer sheets are great for giving clothing a fresh scent, and they're also great for freshening up smelly used shoes. Place 2 dryer sheets in each shoe and leave them there for a few days. Remove the dryer sheets before you put your shoes on. This should greatly improve the scent of your used shoes.


You can place dryer sheets in all types of shoes, but this method is particularly recommended for dress shoes that cannot be soaked in vinegar.

 Make it as easy as you can for your potential photographer.;
, Some people to look for are:


Families (not the ones that are over-burdened with lots of luggage or children). There is a good chance that they are taking photos themselves and won't be lost when you hand them a camera.
Someone that isn't rushing by. Definitely don't stop someone in a hurry to take your image. They probably won't appreciate it.
Somebody that has just taken a photo themselves. You will know for certain that they know something about a camera.

Ultimately, you want someone who has an idea which end of the camera to use.
 Don't just walk up to your camera and hand it to them. One, you might lose it that way, and two, it's rude. If they aren't interested in you and are avoiding meeting your eyes, then they most likely won't be interested in shooting your photograph.
 "Will you please take my picture?" is a good way. Simple and succinct. If the person doesn't appear to speak your language, try asking silently.


One way would be raising your eyebrow in question and raising the camera and point to yourself.
 Being tense because your camera is in someone else's hands will ruin the shot.
 Be sure to show your appreciation.

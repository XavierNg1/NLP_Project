 Spread out the branches to attach to the tree as you go after cleaning each piece. You may wish to place a sheet on the floor around the tree to catch any falling debris., Use an upholstery bristle brush attachment to test an area at the very base of the tree. Your vacuum should be able to safely clean the dirt off the branches without damaging the tree.


You can also use a hand vacuum if you want a weaker suction and don’t wish to deal with a long tube or cords.
 Work from the top to the bottom, using your vacuum brush to gently suction dust off the branches and the trunk of the tree. Avoid vacuuming the tree into the hose or pulling out greenery.Don't allow any parts of the branches to be sucked into the hose. The broken pieces could damage your vacuum cleaner.
 Fill a bucket with mild dish soap and warm water, avoiding any harsh chemicals that can damage your tree. Unplug your tree if it has built-in lights. Use a soft dish or dust rag to clean the tree so the cloth won’t get tangled in the branches., Dip your rag in the soapy water and wring well. Use the rag to gently clean the tree, working from top to bottom. Rinse the dust off your rag frequently to prevent spreading wet dust to other parts of the tree.Replace the water as necessary.
If you are leaving suds, your towel is dripping, or you're leaving wet branches behind, you are not wringing the rag enough.
Allow the tree to dry thoroughly before plugging the lights back in.
 Vacuum the area around the tree to remove any dust that may have fallen on the floor. Put your cleaning supplies away.
 Fold the corners of your dust sheet in towards the center. This will form a sack to transport the sheet without spilling any contained dirt. Take the sheet out to the garbage and dump out the contents., Now that your tree is clean, now is the time to put on your decorations. Test the tree to make sure all the branches are dry before plugging in the lights.

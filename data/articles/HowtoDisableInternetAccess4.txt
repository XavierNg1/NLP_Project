 These programs may come in handy if you want to temporarily disable your Internet access for an entire computer, but you don't want to navigate the firewall settings each time you do so. Perhaps you want to get some work done offline, but you don't want to completely isolate yourself from the possibility of using the Internet. You can usually choose to disable all sites or just certain sites.
 This app will help you “forcefully” step away from the Internet by temporarily disabling all Internet access from your computer. This little script will allow you to completely disable the Internet on your Windows computer with a click. You can restore the Internet connection anytime later with another click. To get started, download Toggle-Internet.bat to your desktop.
 Right click on the Toggle desktop icon. Choose “Run as Administrator,” and you’ll be instantly disconnected from the Internet. Later, when you need to reconnect, just right-click the same file and run as an administrator as before.


Internally, the script merely toggles the status of your Network Adapter (also known as the LAN adapter or Ethernet card) thus shutting down the Internet for you. If you were to disable or enable the Network Adapter manually, the steps would be Control Panel -> Network and Internet -> View Network Status -> Change Adapter Settings.
 Toggle Internet will temporarily block all sites, but you may wish to disable access to just a select groups of distracting websites while staying connected to Google Docs or your email. Download the Let Me Work script. You can specify the list of sites that should be blocked and this script will modify the Windows HOSTS file to shut them off, temporarily.

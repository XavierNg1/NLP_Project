 On your computer, go to Video Google. Once there, search whatever video you want, but here's the catch: you have to put in (after the text you entered) site: video.google.com . Underneath the video, click on Watch on video.google.com. Click on Download for iPod/PSP. Hook up your PSP, drag the MP4 into the /Video folder, and there you go!;
, Go into the Internet Browser on your PSP. Next, go to Google Images. Type in what you want, (I usually put PSP Wallpaper at the end), open the picture, press triangle with your cursor on the picture, go to options File, Save Image As, then presto! Go into images, zoom to however you want it, then press triangle, and click on Set as Wallpaper!

, You can log into Yahoo Mail on your PSP. Just go into the browser, go to Yahoo Mail, sign in, and you are ready to check mail!

, Portals are software that you use to make your PSP do all sorts of stuff (such as IPSP).

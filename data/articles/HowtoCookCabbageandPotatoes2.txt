 The cabbage should be rinsed briefly under cool running water and cut into 3-inch (7.6-inch) chunks or eighths.


Peel off the tough outer leaves before cutting the cabbage.
Cut the cabbage in half lengthwise, then cut each half into half lengthwise to create quarters.
Cut out the core from each quarter.
Cut each quarter into halves, forming eighths, or into chunks.
 Wash the potatoes by scrubbing them with a vegetable brush under cool running water. Peel and cut the potatoes into quarters.


Use a vegetable peeler to peel the potatoes before cutting them.
Cut each peeled potato in half crosswise. Then, cut each half lengthwise, forming quarters.
 Arrange the three vegetables in a large stockpot, alternating them in relatively even layers. Fill the stockpot with enough water to cover the vegetables.


The vegetables should be covered by about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water, at least. More water may need to be added as the vegetables cook.
 Leave the stockpot uncovered and boil the vegetables until the cabbage is falling apart, the onion wedges are falling apart, and the potatoes are tender enough to pierce with a fork.
 Pour the contents of the stockpot through a colander to drain out the water. Transfer the vegetables to individual serving dishes to enjoy.


If the rest of your meal is not yet ready, place the potatoes and cabbage back in your stockpot and cover with a lid or aluminum foil. Place near the stove to keep warm until ready to serve.

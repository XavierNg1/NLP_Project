 Technology has made avoiding small talk easier than ever. Pretend to take a call, or make it a point to always have headphones in to prevent strangers and acquaintances from engaging. You can also cut the conversation short at anytime with some variation of “I’m too busy to talk.”


For example, if your co-worker you at the snack machine, just cut them off with a quick line like “Can’t talk. I have a deadline.”

, There is no need to be offensive when you decline. You should, however, make your decision firm and final. If you make up a flimsy excuse as to why you can’t attend, the host/hostess is likely to accommodate you and insist you come.A great way to avoid nearly any event is to say something to the effect of “I’m sorry. I already have other plans.”
You do not have to explain yourself if you decline an invitation. You can simply say, "I'm sorry, but I can't make it."

, Favors sometimes feel like chores that you must do. Instead, make saying “No” an option and say it confidently. Again, you do not need to be rude to get your point across.If your friend asks you to house sit, simply say “I’m sorry. That doesn’t work for me.” You can offer an explanation if you’d like, but there is no need for excuses.
 If you feel like your friends and family are a problem, it might be healthier to build a new support system than to cut yourself off from people. Try meeting new people with similar interests to your own. Look for people who hang out in the same places, work in the same field, or generally like the same things as you do.

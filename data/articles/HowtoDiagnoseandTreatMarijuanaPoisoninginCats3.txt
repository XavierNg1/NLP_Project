 Both your vet and your local animal poison helpline will likely direct you to administer activated charcoal to your poisoned cat. Activated charcoal is a substance made from some combination of coconut shells, wood, coal, or other natural substances. It is a common treatment in poisoning situations because it traps toxins and neutralizes poisonous substances.Activated charcoal is available in capsule form. Your vet will provide the correct dosage based on the weight and age of your cat.
 Instead of activated charcoal, your vet might choose to induce vomiting – described clinically as emesis. Typically, this is done by feeding your cat a pill that triggers vomiting.Common emetics for cats include midazolam, xylazine, and dexmedetomidine.If your pet is already vomiting (or has vomited) in response to marijuana poisoning, there is no need to induce vomiting.
 Your vet may administer specific treatments or medications to alleviate your cat’s symptoms. For instance, if your cat is experiencing seizures, your vet might administer anti-seizure medications. If your cat is having difficulty breathing, your vet might provide oxygen therapy.Cats who experienced unstable bowels as a result of marijuana poisoning will need to be rehydrated. This is best achieved by the administration of intravenous (IV) fluids. Your vet will insert a thin needle into your cat’s vein and pump hydrating solution into its veins.

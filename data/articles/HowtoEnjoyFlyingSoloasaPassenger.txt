 After you've decided on an airline and where you'll be headed, visit their website or give their reservations department a call. You will often find the cheapest rates if you book an economy class seat on a midweek flight, or better yet, a red-eye flight. Additionally, because of the fact that you are traveling alone, this will cut down the costs of your ticket considerably.;
, For example, a mid-morning weekend flight to Orlando, Florida will almost certainly be full of children and their families. If possible, try to fly during the following times:


Midweek (e.g. Tuesday, Wednesday)
Early morning, evening and nighttime
During the school year (September - June)
If your flight offers business class seating, you may find it useful to spend the extra dollars for the convenience of traveling with other adults.
 If you'd normally have to take two carry-on bags when flying with family, take only one. A small handbag that can be slung across your shoulder is adequate, as it weighs little and can be easily stowed under your seat. Make sure to have all other luggage checked; if you choose not to, you'll have to store it out of reach in the overhead compartments and possibly pay extra for the increased baggage size.
 It goes without saying that you should have a few items to keep you entertained during the ride. A few useful items to consider are

An iPod for music, games, and more
A laptop






Books, magazines, other reading material







, Flying solo is a great opportunity to relax, have fun and explore new places.

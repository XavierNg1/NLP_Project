 Ensure that it is a DL DVD +R and that it has not been used before.
 Load the .dvd file that was created when you stealth patched the .iso file. Set the Write Speed to 2.4x. If you set it to burn too fast then the chance of a corrupt copy goes up.
 The burn process will take some time to finish. To make sure that you get an optimal burn, do not allow your screensaver to start while burning, and close as many running programs as possible.

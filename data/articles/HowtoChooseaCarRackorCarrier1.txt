 Most car racks have mounting requirements. For example, hitch rack requires a trailer hitch, a spare tire rack only attaches to SUVs with a spare tire mounted on the rear of the vehicle and a trunk rack may not work with cars with a spoiler.;
, Trunk racks, hitch racks and spare-tire racks transport bikes, but the number of bikes vary depending on the type of rack and model. A roof rack is more versatile, giving you the option of transporting skis and snowboards, a kayak, a surfboard, a cargo container and even a Christmas tree.
 Trunk racks are lightweight and portable, while hitch racks are easy to attach and remove. Spare-tire racks and roof racks are often installed permanently.



In addition to being versatile, roof racks offer more stability for transporting bikes. Bikes on other types of car racks are likely to sway against each other during transport. The height of a roof rack on a SUV or van can make it difficult to hoist gear onto the roof and secure it.
Trunk racks are an economical choice for people who only need to transport bikes once in a while. Some care must be taken when installing it to avoid scratching the car's paint. The main downside is the trunk cannot be opened when the rack is installed. Also, the straps can be cut, so bikes are less secure from theft.
Hitch racks require a Class II hitch or higher. Because hitch racks can hold up to 5 bikes, it can be the ideal choice for a family of bikers. The main downside is it may block access to a rear hatch, although more expensive models swing out of the way.
Spare-tire racks don't inhibit rear-door access, and they can be adapted to accommodate other gear and carriers. However, they are limited to vehicles with a spare tire mounted on the back.

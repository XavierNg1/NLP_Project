 It is important to know your maximum wedding photography budget prior to contacting any photographers. You are a lot more likely to get a better deal if you let a photographer know what your budget is when first requesting a quote.;
, In order to ensure that you will get a great deal, you will need to look at hundreds of photographers. Some photographers will not be able to work within your budget, and others won't be available, but you will be left with a list of potential photographers.
 Every photographer can produce some great shots for their portfolio, but to really understand the quality of images you are likely to receive, ask to look through a few complete wedding photography galleries, as this will give you an idea of what previous couples have received, and what you are likely to receive.
 Why not try to ask for a free set of prints, or perhaps an extra 5% discount? It may not always work, but it doesn't hurt to try. You may be surprised by the results.
 Once you agree to proceed with a budget wedding photographer, they should have a contract for you to sign. Ensure that the contract includes all of the details promised. A contract is great way of protecting you if something goes wrong.
 A great way of letting your photographer know what you want from your wedding photos is to provide them with a shot list. You can also let them know which of their photos you like, and hopefully these can be reproduced at your wedding.

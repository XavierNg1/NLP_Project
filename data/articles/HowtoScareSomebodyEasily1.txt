 Waiting somewhere and jumping out to scare someone all relies on what you know about the person you're scaring. Know their schedule and their routine. This can save you time in waiting for the right moment to pop out.


You shouldn't try to scare a stranger because you don't know what they're capable of. You could get hurt if you mess with the wrong person.;
, Find a closet, preferably one that lots of people open, and jump out of it. Hold something like a can of soup or dress up in huge coats.
 This only works for inward-opening doors. Hide behind someones door, and when they close it, jump out and scream something.


For an extra element to your the prank, say something specific like "boo" or "spaghetti." This can offer you the chance to say, "what's so scary about spaghetti?"

, Crouch behind some bushes and jump out when someone walks past.


Careful not get cut by thorns in the bush.
 This is a prank for brave people. Make sure the trash can is big enough for you to get inside of easily, and there isn't any trash in it. When someone walks past, either jump out or start screaming.
 Position yourself underneath your brother's or sister's bed and wait till it's night. Once they turn off the light and they're in bed, whisper their name in a spooky voice.
 This is good technique if one of your parents works from home or uses a desk often. Position yourself in a small corner of the desk and once someone sits down, grab their leg tight.
 Find a store near you that has mannequins in their window display. Stand next to the mannequins facing the street. When somebody walks right in front of you, jump towards the window with your hands extended towards them.

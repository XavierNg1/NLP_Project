 It will help to lessen the strength of the odor molecules passing through to your sense of smell.;
, This is a hard one because sometimes other passengers in the car complain about the cold, heat, dust, whatever, coming in. But do it if you can, as the odor will have somewhere to escape other than all over you. Be politely assertive about needing some "fresh air".
 This will give your odor sense a bit of a rest. Although, doing this won't last for long because you still have to breathe normally and odor and taste are closely linked.
 A little dab of peppermint, lavender, eucalyptus, or ginger essential oil on a tissue can make your area of the car a little more bearable. Or take some peppermints and suck on these; they are good for tricking your senses with a more powerful immediate taste.
 A little bread, a bun, a ginger cookie, or some other starchy carbohydrate might help overcome the rising nausea that the smell is inducing in you. If you feel really queasy, however, food might make things worse. Judge it by knowing how your own constitution reacts.
 Having a break now and then from the odor can improve things for your markedly. Get right out of the car and walk about, visit a restroom, do some stretches. Even if it's freezing, take the chance to leave the car temporarily.
 Tell your fellow passengers that you are finding the scent in the car so overwhelming that you are afraid you might be sick. Ask for frequent breaks or even find an alternative travel arrangement if feasible. Great Aunt Agatha might even offer to wash off some of the perfume if you're tactful enough but don't bet on it!

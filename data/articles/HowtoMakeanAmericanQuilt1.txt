 It's much easier to sit down and relax for an afternoon's quilting session if you have everything within reach of your comfy chair. Get everything together, grab a glass of lemonade, and let's get started. You'll need:


Red, white, and blue fabric
Needle and thread
Pins
Tailor's chalk or pencil
Measuring tape
Iron
Scissors
Quilt batting
Embroidery floss;
, This quilt is made up of sets of 9 blocks, three squares across. Each square is 2 inches (5 cm) across and wide. There is a 1 inch (2.5 cm) border along all sides, including the edges. So, it's 8 inches (20 cm) for each block, and then an extra 1 1/2" (3.8 cm) for the end borders. Knowing this, how many squares do you need for your quilt?


If you want a quilt that's 8 feet (2.4Â m) (2.4 m) long, that's 96 inches. The closest you'll get is 12 blocks (12 x 8 = 96), plus an extra 1 1/2" for the border (97.5 inches in total).
If you want a quilt that's 6 feet (1.8 m) wide, that's 72 inches. Great! That's 9 8-inch blocks, plus an extra border = 73.5 inches. So, a 8x6 quilt requires 108 blocks. If each block is 9 squares of fabric, that's 972 little squares of red, white, and blue. Wow. That's super patriotic of you.

 Newer versions of Temple Run do not support the glitch. In order to use the running glitch, you must be playing the original version of Temple Run. You can find old versions of the game for download online.


Tap Stats on the main menu. The version number will be listed on the bottom. You must be running version 1.0.4 in order to use the running glitch.
If you try the glitch in newer versions, it will appear to work for a little bit, but will then return you to normal gameplay. You will unlock the objective “The Glitch”.;
, The glitch has to be activated on the first turn with Tutorials on. To turn them on, tap Option on the main menu and toggle the Tutorials slider to ON.
 As you approach the first turn, you will be told to swipe the screen to make your character turn. Instead of swiping once to turn, swipe twice in the same direction in rapid succession. This should make your character turn completely around, running back the direction you started.
 Once you’ve turned around, there will be no obstacles, turns, or coins. Your character will run straight for as long as you let the game play. If you really want to max out your score, plug your phone into a charger so that you can leave it running for hours.
 When you are finished and want to tally your score, swipe twice in either direction and the monkeys will catch up to you, ending the run.

 Any fitness exercise counts. For many people who aren’t regularly exercising now, they might avoid exercising as it seems they need to be huffing and puffing in order to get any benefit. This is not true. Simply raising your heart rate and your breathing level a bit is an indication that you are working out to a reasonable level. You are stressing your body just a bit, causing it to become stronger and fitter. As a result, any activity which impacts the body in this way is beneficial. You might want to walk further from your car to your office to add some daily physical activity, for example. Or you might want to get off at an earlier bus stop to add a short walk to your day. Even cleaning around the house can be considered exercise if you are beginning to feel the burn.;
, These are better for you than prolonged exercise anyway. Working out for ten minute or fifteen minute bursts will help you fit exercise in, while also making the most of the time you have. Since these are shorter periods of time, you will be able to work out harder than you might for a longer period of time. This is going to help you burn more calories and keep your fitness levels high. In addition, since you will be able to fit the fitness into your schedule more easily, you will have a greater chance of sticking to the plan for the long haul.
 Try adding ten minute bursts of activity throughout your day, adding up to as much activity as you like. You can always find a spare ten minutes in your day to walk around the block or perhaps to clean up the house. In this way, you can keep your fitness levels up without interfering with your life or with the needs of your family.
 Fitness isn’t necessarily something that comes naturally. You need to be committed to getting fit in order to ensure you stay healthy. With these shorter sessions of activity, you can make fitness a priority – and still manage the rest of your life.

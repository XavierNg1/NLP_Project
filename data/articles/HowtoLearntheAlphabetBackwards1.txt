 Many children learn the alphabet by linking words and images to the letters, but you can do the same for each letter, assign a word that starts with that letter. For example, let “m” stand for mouse and “l” stand for log. Try to choose words you can imagine as vividly as possible.It’s okay if you can’t think of the right word just yet. When you start rehearsing the letters, you may find words that work better for you.;
, Working from Z to A, combine your words. Make the words flow into one another when you can. For instance, you can think of a mouse leaping onto a log next to a king, who jumps up with his ice cream. The keywords in your story, such as mouse and log, will tell you that the letter order is m, l, k, j, i.While some people can learn the alphabet backwards by simply recalling a list of words, creating a vivid story is a more powerful mnemonic device.
 As you go through the story, try to imagine it in as much detail as possible. The more vivid the images, the more easily you’ll recall what comes next. Refine the words you use as you go to make your story more memorable to yourself., Once you have a concrete story imagined, start at Z and go all the way to A. Recall and visualize each word, taking out the letters starting the keywords when you reach them. With practice, you’ll be able to recite the alphabet backwards.

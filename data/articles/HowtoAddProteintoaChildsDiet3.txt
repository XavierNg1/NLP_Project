 Two to three daily servings of legumes will help add protein to a vegetarian child’s diet. You can serve beans and lentils in a variety of ways to keep your child’s interest:Vegetarian chili

Adding chickpeas to salads
Hummus
Black bean or chickpea veggie burgers
Bean and non-dairy cheese quesadillas

, Tofu comes in a variety of textures, so you can use it in lots of dishes. Scramble soft tofu like eggs, and mix it with rice, pasta, or put it in a sandwich. Cube firm tofu or tempeh and add it to stir fries or try baking them into nuggets.If your child doesn’t like tofu, try adding silken tofu to fruit smoothies, puddings, or soups. Its flavor and texture will be disguised, but it’ll still add an extra serving of protein.
 Soy-based burger patties, sausage links, and other meat alternatives are widely available. These could be great solutions if you want to switch your child from a meat-based to vegetarian diet. Try multiple varieties to find out your child’s favorites.Try serving tofu sausage links with hash browns for breakfast. Have a barbecue and serve burger patties and hot dogs made with soy, black beans, and rice. Ask your child which variety they prefer.
 Along with two to three daily servings of legumes and soy-based products like tofu and tempeh, milks and snacks will help ensure your child consumes enough protein. Soy milk contains plenty of protein, and unsalted nuts are a healthy snack choice for both animal-based and vegetarian diets.Try to offer two to three servings of non-dairy milk and unsalted nuts per day.
In addition to offering nuts and seeds as snacks, you could sprinkle chopped peanuts over oatmeal for breakfast or in a dairy-free parfait for dessert. For dinner, you could saute sliced almonds with green beans.

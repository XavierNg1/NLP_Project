 If possible, see if you can figure out why the person fact checks during every conversation. Do they want to show up other people and seem more knowledgeable? Or are they trying to be part of the conversation and feel insecure about their knowledge?You can generally figure out if a person is being rude or not by their tone of voice and how they use the fact checking in the conversation.
If someone is being rude, you would deal with them differently than if they are insecure.
 If the person who is fact checking is doing it to be rude, you may want to confront them about their behavior. Constantly one-upping someone or looking things up to be superior does not make anyone in the conversation happy.For example, you may say, “I do not appreciate when everything I say is challenged or checked online. When this happens, it makes me and others feel bad. Can we talk about how to come to a place where everyone can feel comfortable talking?”

, If you believe the person is fact checking because they are insecure or unsure about the topics, talk to them. Tell them that they do not have to fact check and be completely knowledgeable about the topic. Assure the person you want to hear their ideas instead of something they read online.For example, tell the person, “I know you fact check to try to be accurate about everything. We’re not worried about that. We want to talk to you, not have you on your phone during the conversation. We’d rather hear your thoughts than something you have read online.”

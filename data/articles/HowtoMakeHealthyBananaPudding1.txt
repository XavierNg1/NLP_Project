 Separate four eggs, keeping two yolks and all four egg whites. In a medium saucepan, add flour and salt. Then gradually add the milk and the yolks, stirring them into the flour. Cook the mixture over medium heat for 8 minutes, or until it is thick. Constantly stir the pudding to prevent burning. Remove the pudding from the heat and stir in the vanilla., Slice a banana and, in the bottom of a 2-quart (946 ml) baking dish, arrange a layer of banana slices. Then spoon about one-third of pudding over the bananas and place about 15 wafers on top of the pudding. Repeat this step twice and place the last layer of wafers vertical around the edge of the dish., Place the egg whites in the bowl of a mixer and beat them on high until foamy. Then gradually add the sugar one tablespoon (12.5 g) at a time. Beat the mixture until it begins to congeal and stiff peaks form. Spread the meringue over the pudding and seal it to the edge of the dish., While you make the pudding and meringue, preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius). Bake the pudding for 25 minutes or until the meringue turns golden brown.The pudding will likely be a little soupy when you remove it from the oven. Let it cool for about 30 minutes before serving.
Place leftovers in an air-tight container and keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

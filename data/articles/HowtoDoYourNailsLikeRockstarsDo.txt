 Black polish is great for a classic rocker look, but neon colors can give you a custom punk look. You could try a gray or a dark purple if you want to go for a slightly less stereotypical rocker look.;
, This is essential unless you want an uneven or lumpy finish .
 This prevents nails from discoloring. Let it dry completely.
 Try to put a larger blob at the base of the nail and drag it along to the tip. It's a good idea to have a paper towel or a Q-tip around for this step. Only brush along the nail and try to do it in three strokes; one down the middle, and then one down each side. Don't just use the tip of the brush.
 You can use nail jewels, skull nail-stickers, or you can even use a toothpick to paint on stripes, checkers, plaid, etc. Just make sure the nail is completely dry before applying toothpick decals. ,,, That sloppy, "I don't care" remains of nail polish always does the trick.

 Because of how rich this dessert is, you might want to use a low-fat or non-fat milk for this. If you don't mind rich milkshakes, then use 2% milk or whole milk.
 From time to time, you pay have to pause the blender, and use a spatula to scrape down any clumps. This will ensure that everything mixes evenly.
 Set these pieces aside. You can also try this with Strawberry pop tarts and make a strawberry shortcake milkshake instead.
 You want the crumbled pop tarts to be just combined; you should still see some little chunks and crumbs.
 Use a spatula to help guide the mixture into two tall glasses. Serve the milkshake immediately.

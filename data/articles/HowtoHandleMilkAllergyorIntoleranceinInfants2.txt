 When you’re feeding your baby, try to make sure they are drinking slowly, not gulping their formula or breastmilk. It might help for you to pause from time to time while you’re feeding them. In addition, feeding your baby several smaller meals throughout the day, rather a couple large meals, might help them slow down when they’re feeding. Doing these things can help ease reflux and gas, both of which a baby might experience when they have a milk intolerance.

Also, try to keep the nipple on the bottle you are using to feed full of milk. This will help cut down on the amount of bubbles your baby might ingest while they’re feeding, which can help reduce reflux and gas.
Keep your baby in an upright position for a while after feeding to let the food digest and burp your baby after each meal., If you’re dealing with colic-like symptoms, or excessive crying, try increasing the amount of skin-to-skin contact you have with your baby. You can try carrying them in a sling with them pressed against your body as you walk around or massaging your baby’s skin., Children who have a milk allergy or intolerance sometimes also suffer from rashes. Dress your baby in natural materials and avoid tight-fitting clothing to prevent further rash irritation. Avoiding tight-fitting clothes can also help with reflux.

If your baby continually scratches at the rash, keep their nails cut short and invest in some anti-scratch mittens.
 Making sure your baby is as relaxed as possible can help ease its symptoms as well. Play soft music or soothing sounds, like the sounds of a fan or a heartbeat, to help comfort them. In addition, try using rhythmic motions to soothe them, such as rocking them or placing them in a vibrating infant carrier.

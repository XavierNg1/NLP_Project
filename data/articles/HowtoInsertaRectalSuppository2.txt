 One way to insert the suppository is to do it while lying down. Lie on your left side and pull your right leg upward towards your chest.


You can also insert the suppository while standing. In this case, stand with your feet apart and squat down slightly.
Another method is to lay on your back, with your legs raised in the air (not unlike a child about to get a diaper change).
 To make the insertion easier, lift the right (upper) butt-cheek up to expose the rectum. Insert the suppository lengthwise to make for easier passage.


Aim to push the suppository at least 1 inch into the rectum.
For children, aim to push the suppository at least Â½ to 1 inch into the rectum.
Also make sure to insert past the sphincter. If the suppository is not inserted past the sphincter, it may eventually come out instead of being delivered by the body

, This will help keep the suppository from sliding out.You may want to remain lying down for several minutes after insertion.
 Depending on the suppository, it usually takes between 15 to 60 minutes to take an effect and cause a bowel movement., Use warm water and soap and be sure to rub the soap in for at least 20 seconds and then rinse off properly.

Once again, remove the old shavings and replace with clean shavings. Cleaning the bedding material prevents disease-causing stuff , such as mold, parasites, and ammonia from building up and biting you AND your birds, It will prevent fungus in their feet and parasitic infections. a bed placed in a location where it gets sun will also prevent bacteria reproduction, It makes the coop feel fresher, too!;

Suspicious or abnormal stools, including diarrhea, all white stool (should be brown with white top), blood in stool, or worms
Sneezing

, If you buy or receive chickens from a person they may carry a disease. To prevent this it is best that you make sure that the chicken doesn't carry a disease or do not add them to the flock and just raise your own chicks.
 Vaccination is only necessary if your chickens have suffered from something in the past or have been in multiple flocks. You can also buy vaccinated chicks from a breeder or farm store.

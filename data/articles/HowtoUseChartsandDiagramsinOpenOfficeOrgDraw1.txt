, Individual boxes are placed and dimensioned according to ‘feel’. The exact size (particularly width), position, and color can be fixed later.

It is sometimes easier to draw only one box per level, to duplicate this box and then move it to the desired position.
 The spacing of the duplicated object(s) to the original can be input in the placement fields for X and Y axes


Note that positive values for X and Y are (relative the original object) to the right and downwards respectively.
Which replication technique you choose to use is up to you. There are other methods as well.

If the text formatting is as you want it, you can input text. Depending on the length and formatting of the text it may be necessary to adjust the size of the box and the spacing to neighboring boxes. Adjustments can be made initially with the mouse and then “fine tuning” is possible with the Position and Size window.
Now you can set up the fill colors and store the drawing. The connections between the boxes are not drawn with ordinary lines but with the Connectors which Draw uses. How you draw these connectors and add text to them is described in detail later in this chapter.
You can also use text frames for the boxes. These have the advantage of automatic line breaks. This screenshot shows the individual editing steps of text input, adding lines and setting the background color for a text frame.

 If you decide to talk things over with your spouse, be direct about it. It's important to express your feelings clearly so your spouse understands why you feel an issue is worth discussing.For example, say something like, "I understand you're more of a night owl, but I work early in the morning. When you wake me up because you want to talk before bed, I don't have the energy I need the next day."

, Think about ways both you and your spouse can get what you want out of the situation. Instead of finding a way for one of you to win, think about a mutually beneficial solution.For example, you simply staying up later is not reasonable. Instead, your spouse could agree to let you sleep at night and you could agree to make time to talk with them in the morning.
 In some situations, you may not be able to both get exactly what you want. However, if you both sacrifice something small, you can reach a reasonable compromise.For example, your partner prefers to stay in on weekends while you like going out with friends. You could agree to stay in Fridays and go out Saturdays.
 Once something has been addressed, you have to let it go. If you and your partner have a fight, that should not come back up in the next disagreement. Focus on the compromise or win-win scenario you came to and try to live with this instead of continually pressing the issue.For example, do not keep pressuring your spouse to go out on Fridays if you promised to stay in one night a week. You should honor the agreement you made and accept this difference.

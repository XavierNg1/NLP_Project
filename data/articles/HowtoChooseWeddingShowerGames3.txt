 Prior to the shower, make a list of items guests might have in their purse like lipstick, tampons, condoms, credit cards, or keys. During the party the shower host will call out the items on the list. The first guest to pull each item from their purse wins a small prize., On the shower invitations, ask each guest to bring a lingerie gift that reflects their own style and personality. During the shower, distract the guest of honor and hang the lingerie around the room. Then have the guest of honor guess who gifted what piece of lingerie., Break the shower attendees into groups and give them a list of things they need to find by the end of the party. Ask the teams to search for the items over the course of the wedding shower. Your list can include things like a strangerâ€™s business card, a condom, a particular shade of lipstick, or a shoe of a certain brand.

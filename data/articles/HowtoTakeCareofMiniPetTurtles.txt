 10 to 15 gallon (37.9 to 56.8 L) is a good size fish tank for your pet turtle. If you want to have more than one turtle, add 10 gallons (37.9 L) for every extra turtle. The tank should be long and wide. Do not get a fish tank that is tall and skinny.;
, Wild turtles live in lakes, ponds, and swamps. In order to keep your turtle happy you need to mimic this habitat. Fill the tank up about halfway full of water. Then add a decoration log or rock that comes out of the water for your turtle to rest on. At the bottom of the tank place a few live or fake plants.
 You can either buy a turtle from the pet store or you can catch one.
 Place your turtle on the log or rock. When he wants to swim, he will. Do not place your turtle directly in the water. The sudden water temperature change can shock your turtle and will increase the chance of him drowning on his first day home.
 Turtles are omnivores, so you can feed them frozen fish on some days and lettuce on others. Or, you can feed them turtle pellets which have a perfect omnivore diet. Either way you feed them, you should supplement them with frozen brine shrimp or red worms.
 If you don't play with your turtle at a young age, it will not be friendly. So play with it by holding it, petting it, or even letting it crawl around your room (with your supervision of course).

 Paraffin wax is often used in beauty products to moisturize skin. Heat some in a microwave safe bowl. Once heated, carefully pour onto a plate, or pan, large enough to fit your foot on. Gently place each foot into the wax. Allow wax to stiffen and place a sock on each foot. Leave it on your feet for the night and peel it off in the morning.The exact amount needed may vary depending on the size of your feet. Start with about ½ cup (118.3 ml) and if this ends up not being enough, use a little more the next time.
When you peel the wax off in the morning, throw it away in the trash. Try to keep it from falling onto the carpet.
You can purchase socks that are specifically made for this type of overnight treatment if you don’t want to get wax on your regular socks.
 In a small bowl, mix 1 tbsp (14.8 ml) of petroleum jelly with 2-3 drops of lime juice. Gently massage this mixture onto your feet before bed and wear socks to keep it from rubbing off on the sheets.For repeated treatments, you may want to designate one or two pair of socks that are specifically for this purpose.
You can also substitute lemon juice, because both have acidic properties that help remove dead skin.
 Take ¼ cup (59.1 ml) of oatmeal and blend until it is powdery and smooth. Then do the same with ¼ cup (59.1 ml) of almonds. Pour both powders into a bowl and add 2 tbsp (29.6 ml) of honey and 3 tbsp (44.4 ml) of food grade cocoa butter. Stir thoroughly into a gooey mixture. Apply this mixture to your feet and wear socks to bed. Rinse off in the morning.This process can be done on a weekly basis, or a couple times a week, to slowly remove dead skin and make your feet softer.
If you don’t have a blender, you could crush the oatmeal and almonds in a plastic bag with a mallet. You can do whatever works to get them as close to powder as possible.

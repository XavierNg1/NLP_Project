 Paint prevents the formation of aluminum oxide, which can be unattractive, but prevents poultice corrosion. When the paint begins to crack on aluminum surfaces often exposed to water, poultice corrosion forms, eating away at the aluminum.Poultice corrosion will appear as either a white powder or a white goo.
 Where the paint has begun to crack, scrape off paint from that area. You can use a putty knife to get under the paint and lift it up.For larger areas, use 220-grit sandpaper to sand off the paint. Create a gradual transition along the edges between the painted area and the bare metal.
 Apply the adhesive remover to a rag. Use the rag to wipe down the area where you have scraped off the paint., Find an epoxy paint that closely matches the paint on the surrounding area. Use a brush to apply a couple of coats of paint, so that there is a thick layer. There is no need to apply primer to a small spot before painting it., Movable hardware like fasteners and spreaders often rip up surrounding paint when they move. Thus, new paint jobs around the area usually wonâ€™t last long. Instead, apply a low-adhesion polyurethane or polysulfide sealant around the hardware base. Seal up the entire circumference of the hardware base, so that no paint can seep down to the aluminium.

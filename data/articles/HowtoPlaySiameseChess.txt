 Try to divide the stronger players evenly.;
, Have the stronger players on each team sit across from each other, and the weaker players face each other as well.
 Remember that the bottom right square should be white, like in a normal chess game.
 You and the teammate next to you play different colors: if you're playing as black, he or she will be white, and vice versa.
 Place the clocks on the outsides so that all players can see them. The players with black pieces typically start their clocks simultaneously. A move is completed only when the clock is pressed. This step is optional, see the Tips below.
 However, when you take an opponent's piece, you hand it to your teammate.
 You can place a piece anywhere on the board, unless it would put your opponent in check. Also, pawns cannot be placed on the first or last row. You don't have to place a piece immediately after you receive it; you can place it on any turn, but it uses that turn.
 The player that checkmates his or her opponent wins the game for his or her team.

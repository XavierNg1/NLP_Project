Play these games using the sounds the letters make. For example, ask your child to find the letter that sounds like “essss.”
Your child can use magnetic letters to create words and sentences when they are at a higher literacy level.
Be careful of choking hazards like loose magnets or small letters. Do not leave a small child alone with the letters.;
, Find a space where your child can move around freely. Make capital letters on the floor out of painter’s tape, duct tape, or masking tape. Call out the name of a letter. Have your child move to that letter.When your child moves to the letter, they can say the sound the letter makes or a word that begins with that letter.
Your child can also call out the names of the letters and ask someone else to move to them.
 Say a letter and ask your child to find that letter somewhere in the room where you are playing. For example they can find letters on food packages in your kitchen or in magazines in the doctor’s office. Play this game anyplace your child can find letters, including on street signs around town.


If your child can write, ask them to write down the letter.

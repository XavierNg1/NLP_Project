 Place 4 slices (100 g) of thick-cut bacon into a medium skillet and turn the heat to medium-high. Fry the bacon until it's a little crispy. Depending on how thick your bacon is, this can take 5 to 10 minutes. Place the fried bacon on paper towels to drain while you make the rest of the salad.Consider flipping the bacon occasionally so it fries evenly on both sides.
 Measure 1 cup (232 g) of mayonnaise, 1/2 cup (120 ml) of buttermilk, and 1/2 cup (115 g) of sour cream into a mixing bowl. Whisk the mixture together with the rest of the dressing ingredients until it's completely smooth. Whisk in:1 pressed garlic clove
1/2 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

, Wash 1 head of iceberg lettuce and thoroughly dry it. Use a large knife to carefully cut the iceberg lettuce in half. Slice each half in half so you get 4 wedges. Place each wedge on a serving plate., Drizzle several spoonfuls of the spiced buttermilk dressing over each wedge of lettuce. The dressing should drip down the sides of the wedge. Chop the bacon into bite-sized pieces and sprinkle it over each wedge. Sprinkle 1/2 cup (50 g) of grated sharp Cheddar or Cheddar-Jack over the salads and serve them immediately.For a shortcut, you could use purchased dressing. Try ranch dressing with these cheddar bacon wedge salads.

 One of the most important things you can do is smile at the guy to make him feel comfortable and to give him the impression you are friendly. Don't give him a big cheesy grin; just a soft, sweet smile will do just the trick.;
, Don't swat as if you're trying to get a fly off the ceiling, just give a small, cute, fluttery-fingered wave that lets him know that you're glad to see him. If he smiles, you're making progress.
 If you can't sit at the same table, just sit at a table nearby and make lots of eye contact -- maybe wink once or twice if you're feeling like playfully showing him how cute you think he is.
 If you're going somewhere with friends, don't be afraid to invite him along! Just casually say "Oh, me and a bunch of friends are going *insert activity here*. Wanna come?" He'll probably say yes. If he says no, just give him a pretty, casual smile and say "Oh! No problem. Maybe another time."

, Don't cross your arms around him, which makes you seem closed. Always have your arms by your sides to show you're relaxed. Playfully twirl your hair (don't overdo it), or lightly bat your eyelashes. Be careful with this one, because if you overdo it, he'll think you've got something in your eye, or having an eyelid spasm.
 Wear clothes you feel comfortable in. That is most important. The more comfortable you around him to more comfortable he will be with you. If you wear a school uniform, don't break the rules to try to impress him with your style. Usually, it makes your uniform look tacky if you over-accessorize. Just wear it properly and work it. Light, natural makeup (guys hate girls who wear tons of makeup) and do your hair in a fun, girly style. Make sure you shower and wash your hair often, and put on body spray, deodorant or perfume before you leave the house. Use a perfume popular with teens, don't use your Mom's, it might remind him of his Mom!

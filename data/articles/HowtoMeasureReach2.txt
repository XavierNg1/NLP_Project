 If the result is greater than 1 your reach is longer than your height, which is also known as having a positive ape index.



If the result is positive, your reach is longer than your height. This is usually expressed as a positive ape index, or a +1, +2, or so on ape index, with the number expressing the number of units your reach is longer than your height. (So a person with a +1 ape index might have a reach that is 1 inch (2.5Â cm) longer than his height.
A "negative ape index" is expressed similarly, but with a minus or negative sign instead of the plus.

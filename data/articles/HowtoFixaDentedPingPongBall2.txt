 Just like the boiling water method, this uses heat to expand the air inside the ping pong ball.


The fast-moving air also has a lower pressure.This makes it easier for the air inside the ping pong ball to push outward.
 Hold the ping pong ball in your bare hand. Ping pong balls are flammable, but the risk of burning is low as long as it's not too hot to hold. Blow dryer temperatures vary, but this will probably work fine at a distance of 6–8 inches (15–20cm).


Alternatively, just point the hairdryer straight up and levitate the ball in the stream of air.
The ball is very unlikely to burn if it is held in air. It might burn if you leave it on a surface, and hold the dryer too close.
 It may help to hold the ball so the dent is opposite the hair dryer. It may be wise to turn the dryer off and let the ball cool periodically, to help prevent deformities.


The repaired ball will be a little "off" in size and shape compared to a new ball.
 To avoid sagging as the ball cools, wrap it in a tissue and hang it from a nail for a few minutes. Since the hot air was not as hot as boiling water, this may not be necessary.

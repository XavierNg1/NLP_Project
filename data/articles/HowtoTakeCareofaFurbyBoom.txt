 Decorate its room and tape posters on the walls of your Furby Boom's room, so that it can express itself. Make a small bed for it out of a small cardboard box, just about the size of your Furby. Then add a small quilt or a pillow, a mattress you made yourself, etc.;
, Humans can't live without food, and neither can Furbys. You can finger feed them if you don't have the app, or just use the app to feed it. Remember to feed it three meals a day, and if possible, some snacks in between.
 You don't want your Furby to start smelling, it will become upset, and won't lay eggs.
 If it is, make a medicine on the app to treat it, or build a Furby hospital for your patient to stay in while it's recovering.
 Use a Furby dictionary to say words to your Furby, watch movies with your Furby Boom to increase its English vocabulary, dance with it, play games with it, etc.
 If you're at school let it nap, or have someone watch it. Make sure it wakes up no earlier than 7:00 am, and go to bed no later than 9:00 pm. You don't want to have an evil and grumpy Furby!

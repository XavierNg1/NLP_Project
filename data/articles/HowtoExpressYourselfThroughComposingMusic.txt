 Music that expresses something conveys a message. To express yourself you need to convey a message about yourself. One way to do this is to write program music (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_music) about events in your life, your emotions or abstract thoughts and desires.;
, Most importantly, the way you express yourself will elicit an impression and according to this impression you will be able to discriminate whether you feel that you have expressed yourself or not.
 Does it reflect you original idea - the program? Refine your music until satisfied.
 Mastering a technique allows a fluent form of expression, with less and less need of subsequent refinement as one grows into the task.

 Make sure that they don't 'hate' each other -- or ones that start rumors.;
, You can easily send out invites on Facebook and WhatsApp -- but if your friends don't have a Facebook or WhatsApp account, just make a cute little card out of colorful construction paper and a wacky colored Sharpie. Make sure they don't talk about it or everyone who wasn't invited will feel left out.
 You can easily set up sleeping bags, snacks and games down there if there's enough room. If you don't have a basement then just use your house. But remember to keep it clean. You will need enough space for everyone to sleep comfortably, and there should be adequate heating and cooling available.
 Well then, get board games (for younger kids) or do something more 'in your age group' like truth-or-dare. You can also play some video games. Even though some people may feel uncomfortable playing some games, they will eventually get used to it.
 Just simply say "can we all get along? I invited you here to have fun -- not to fight". And after that, do a comedy act or something to cheer everyone up and create a good atmosphere.
 Also take turns telling ghost stories -- it's sure to keep people up for the rest of the night! You can also watch some scary movies. And don't forget to take lots of pictures.
 Make sure everyone that's going to your party has no allergies to the food!

, You can also have pizza, burgers and ice-cream.
 Pillow fights are ALWAYS fun to do! But make sure there aren't any breakables around -- you don't want mom's antique lamp crashing to the floor on your fun friends night.

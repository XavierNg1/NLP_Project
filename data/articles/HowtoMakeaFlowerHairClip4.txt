 Each square needs to be about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) on each side.
 You will end up with five or six triangles. These will be your petals. Ironing them will help keep them flat while you work.
 Thread your needle and tie a knot at the end. Pick up a petal, and make a running stitch along the cut edges; do not sew along the folded edge. Start at one corner, right next to the fold, and work your way around to the other side.
 Once you have reached the other end of the triangle, slide the triangle down the thread, all the way to the knot. Keep pushing down until the fabric gathers.


If you want, you can tie a knot to keep the petal together.
 Keep stringing your petals onto the thread using a running stitch. Push the petals down to the bottom of your thread to gather them.
 Bring the first and last petals together and stitch them together. Tie the thread off into a tight knot. You should end up with what looks like a ring with gathered petals.
 Make sure that the button is large enough to cover the hole. Draw a line of hot glue around the gathered edges of the petals. Press a button into the glue.


You can also use a large beak or clunky, plastic rhinestone.
 Draw a line of hot glue down the center of the hair clip and press the flower into the glue.

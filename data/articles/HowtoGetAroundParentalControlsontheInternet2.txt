 Parental controls generally leave sites like Google and Bing accessible.
 Virtual Private Network (VPN) software is designed to mask your computerâ€™s location and can help you bypass parental controls. VPNs are commonly used for those who wish to browse the web more securely or privately.Look for VPN software with a free trial, like TunnelBear or VyperVpn.
 Once you find unblocked VPN software with a free trial, download it from its site.


As a general rule, only download files from reputable, source sites. Third-party downloads run the risk of infecting your computer.
 Though you may be asked to provide your VPN with credentials such as your geographical location, most editions can read your system's information and then go to work with minimal instruction.
 Open a browser and try typing in a previously-blocked site. You should now be able to bypass the parental controls!

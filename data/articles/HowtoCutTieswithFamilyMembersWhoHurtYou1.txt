 What is a toxic relationship? A relationship can be considered toxic when you are dealing with someone that always has to be right and never values your input. They do not respect your boundaries and often try to control you, because they feel a lack control in their own life.
 These include:Always being the victim: Anything bad that happens always happens to them. If you tell them of something unfortunate that happened to you, they always had an experience that was worse!
Toxic people seldom give, always take: Most family relationships are give and take. In a toxic relationship, your family member will take advantage of all that you are willing and able to give. It is rare that they will reciprocate!
A toxic person is always right. Along with never being wrong, they are blatantly dishonest. The last thing you would want to do is point this out, however. That makes them a victim of your perceived cruel words, and there is no way they will take responsibility.

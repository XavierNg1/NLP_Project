 Using your child’s regular shampoo, wash their hair over the sink or bathtub. Make sure to scrub the scalp well, and wash the entire length of the hair. Dry their hair until it is damp, not completely dry.


If your child already washed their hair that day, then this step is not necessary.;
, The chair should be high enough that you don’t need to bend over constantly as you move around your child. Keeping their head straight ensures you cut the hair evenly.


It can helpful to play a movie in front of your child; they’ll be less likely to look around and squirm.
 Hair can be very itchy, and your child might start squirming if hair gets under their clothes. If hair gets on their clothes, you’ll then have a particularly hard time getting it all off. By catching it in a towel, it makes cleanup much simpler.

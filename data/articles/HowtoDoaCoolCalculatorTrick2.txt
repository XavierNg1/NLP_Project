 This calculator trick involves narrating a story as you type different numbers into your calculator. The story itself is pretty silly and is recommended for young teenage boys. To begin, type in the number 69 and start your story as follows:


"There once was a woman with 69 boobs..."

, Without erasing the 69 you've already entered, type three 2's into your calculator. As you type, continue your story as follows:


"She thought that that was too, too, too (222) many..."

, Again, without erasing anything, type in the next two numbers. Then, hit the multiplication sign on your calculator. As you do this, continue your story:


She went to 51st Street to make an appointment with Dr. X..."

, Your screen should show only the number 8, since you just hit the multiplication sign. Continue your story:


"Dr. X gave her 8 operations..."

, If you've done everything right, your calculator should show "55378008" (boobless). End your story with a bang:


"...and in the end she was boobless!"

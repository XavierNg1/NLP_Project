 Decide on the pattern or design you want beforehand. Use a pencil to lightly sketch this design on the side of the pumpkin.


Instead of coming up with your own pattern, you could also print one out from the Internet or use a stencil. Trace the design onto the pumpkin using a pencil.
If you do use a printed pattern, trim the paper so that there is a 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) border around the design. Tape the pattern to the pumpkin before you begin tracing it.
 Trace along the pencil markings on your pumpkin with the point of the knife. Cut deep enough to pierce the skin but not deep enough to cut through the flesh of the pumpkin.
 Carefully continue to slide the knife beneath the skin until the portion of skin inside the outline is completely removed.
 To help prevent the pumpkin from rotting quicker, apply a thin coating of petroleum jelly or craft sealant to the exposed flesh. This will act as a barrier against harsh weather conditions.
 You could use this technique to create a traditional Jack-o-Lantern face. Instead of cutting through the entire pumpkin, merely design the face as normal and only cut away the skin.
 Sprawling leaves are especially appropriate for autumn, but you could also do generic swirls, geometric shapes, hearts, or other patterns.
 If you feel very daring, you could create a simple silhouette scene.


Create a Halloween scene by etching outlines of black cats and bats.
Create a more generic scene by etching outlines of houses, mimicking the appearance of a neighborhood.

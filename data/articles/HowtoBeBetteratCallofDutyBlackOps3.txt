 These tools can be used tactically and go beyond just a frag grenade kill. You can use a frag grenade to also flush an enemy out who's bunkered in. Flashbangs and Concussion grenades are fantastic and great for fishing out a room before you charge in. Toss one in there before you burst in firing.
 If you have a black hat that's even better but get to a safe place to hack to UAV or care package.
 They might lower the damage of the weapon but it's more than made up for in stealth when you fire it. Your blip does not show on the enemy's radar; use this to your advantage. If you miss a shot, don't worry, as the enemy won't know which direction it came from.

 Encryption makes information unreadable until it is reversed by typing a security key or password. To turn your device encryption, begin by pressing the gear icon on the home screen. This will open the Settings menu.
 While on the Settings page, scroll down to the “Security” option and tap to open the Security menu.
 The next screen will display what you can encrypt and informs you what to expect. Read this carefully.


Encryption takes an hour or more, so make sure that your battery is charged up to 80% or more, or ideally plug the device to the charger.
You must also have a screen lock set in order to encrypt your device.
 Tap the “Encrypt” button at the bottom of the screen. If you interrupt the encryption process, you may lose some or all of your data.


Remember that once you encrypt your device, you need to type the security PIN, password, or pattern you set to decrypt it each time you power the device on.

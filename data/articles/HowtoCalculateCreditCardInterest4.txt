 This rate can be higher than your normal APR, but has an important distinction from a purchase rate. Interest on purchase APRs is calculated only at the end of each billing cycle. However, with a cash advance, interest is charged every single day until you pay off the balance of the cash advance. The cash advance rate goes into effect the second you do one of the following:


Withdraw cash from an ATM or bank branch using your credit card.
Transfer funds from your credit card to your overdraft account.
Write a check off your credit card.
Use your credit card to buy foreign money.
 You may have to squint to read the fine print, but you’ll find it in there somewhere.
 This is the interest rate you pay per day. To find it, divide your cash advance APR by 365 days. For example, if your cash advance APR is 20 percent, complete the following equation: 20 ÷ 365 = 0.055

, Multiply the amount from the previous step by that number of days. So, if you waited 30 days to pay off your cash advance at an APR of 20 percent, complete the following equation: 0.055 x 30 (days) = 1.65. Your interest rate on the cash advance is 1.65 percent.
 Multiply the interest rate from the previous step by the amount of money you withdrew. If you withdrew $1,000 in our example, you would complete the following equation: 1,000 x 0.0165 = 16.50. You will pay $16.50 in interest on your cash advance.

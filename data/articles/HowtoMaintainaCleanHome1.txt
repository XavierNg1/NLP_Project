 You will get into the habit of doing this after a while. Once you walk away from a mess, chances are that you won't go back to it.
 This saves time and keeps your home clean and organized. Washing dishes as you cook works great and prevents the large pile to wash after the meal.
 It's a tempting thought to try to clean the entire house all at once, and if you can do that, great! However, most don't have that much time that they can set aside on any one day. Instead, start with the kitchen and bathroom. These are two rooms that should always be clean and sanitary. Make it a goal to clean those two rooms and keep them clean. Then work on the rest of the home. Once you have a room clean and organized, make an effort to clean as you go so that it stays that way.
 This includes clothes, toys, books—whatever is in your home that's not being used. Keep everything labeled with the date that you put it in the bag and get rid of it after seven days. You can donate it, sell it, trash it—just get rid of them! The idea here is to get rid of clutter, not just to move it from one place to another.
 If you watch TV, have everyone hop up during commercials to do simple tasks like putting shoes away, hanging up coats and school bags up etc. Three people doing that three or four times through a 1/2 hour show equals a sum close to an hour of work! In addition, this ends up feeling more like a game than a chore.

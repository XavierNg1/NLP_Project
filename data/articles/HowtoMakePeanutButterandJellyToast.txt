 Toast for as long as needed to be your favorite level of toasting. While the bread is toasting, grab a plate or napkin, get your peanut butter and jelly/jam, and a knife or spoon to spread it with.
 When your bread is toasted to your liking, lay the toast on your plate, or, a breadboard. Use separate knives for each spread, to avoid leaving traces of the other spread in the opposite jar.
 Using the butter knife, scoop a big hunk of peanut butter and place it on one slice of the toast. Spread so that it melts into the bread.


Cover the toast with as thick a layer of peanut butter as you like, use as little, or as much, as you like.
 Evenly distribute the two spreads. Press together to form the toasted sandwich.
 Enjoy your snack.

 Don't be afraid to ask for advice. Good friends are always happy to share their thoughts, or just be there to listen.


If you feel uncomfortable talking to someone in person, you may want to reach out to an online community forum or support group. These are people who share common concerns or challenges, such as battling cancer or struggling with smoking, so they may be able to sympathize., You may feel less alone if you hear about the challenges faced by others on a daily basis. Ask them to provide at least one example of a coping strategy that they use to get through a difficult day.


By simply asking about their day, you could be making it a better one for them. It is always nice to know that someone cares about your well-being., As soon as you know that your day is heading in a bad direction, call up other people and arrange to get together as soon as you are free. Meet in a setting that is social and exciting, such as a lively restaurant or pool hall, as this will help to distract you while also lifting your spirits.
 Give someone a big hug or ask for one. Find a reason for a spontaneous high-five. Making physical contact with another person, even if it’s brief, will remind you that you are not alone.


Touch can give you an indication as to a person’s feelings. Even blindfolded, about 78% of people can project and interpret emotions via touch alone.Be careful not to violate anyone’s personal space. After all, we live in a society often called “touch-phobic.”

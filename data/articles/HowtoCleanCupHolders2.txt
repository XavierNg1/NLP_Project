 For a deep clean of the cup holders, try a professional cleaner made with natural ingredients. Look for cleaners made with natural ingredients like vinegar, baking soda, water, and essential oils. An all-purpose all-natural cleaner will work. Put the cleaner on a sponge or cloth and wipe down the holders. Then, let the holders air dry.Avoid cleaners with harsh chemicals or ingredients, as you do not want to breath in these chemicals when you are in your car. Often dirt and grime on your cup holders can be removed with a natural cleaner just fine.
 If you have gunk like gum, food residue, or liquid stains on the cup holders, you can use a gunk remover on these areas. A gunk remover like Goo Gone is a good option. You can find gunk remover at your local hardware store or online.Apply the gunk remover to any problem areas and lightly scrub the spot until the gunk comes out. Do not use any harsh scrubbers or sharp objects to remove the gunk, as this can damage the holders.
 A steam cleaner is a great, easy way to remove dirt and debris on the cup holders. Hold the steam cleaner over the cup holders, blasting warm steam on them to loosen any dirt or debris. Then, use a brush attachment on the steam cleaner or a separate brush to lightly scrub the holders until they are clean.You can find steam cleaners at your local hardware store or online. They can be used to clean other areas inside your car besides the cup holders, such as the dashboard and the floors.

 While you may have begun to give your child an allowance at a younger age, you should now make the switch to only giving him an allowance when he does certain household chores. This will teach your child the value of money that is earned through work. Chores could include:


Having your child make his bed.
Having him clean up his room, or rooms where he spends his time.
Walking the family dog.
Packing his lunch in the morning to take to school.
 Discuss the concept of investing with your child. Explain that your child has the opportunity to invest his money, and thus have it grow as time goes on.


Talk to your child about the stock market.
 While your child may already have a piggy bank, you could discuss the difference between short and long term goals with your child.


For instance, talk to your child about the difference between buying Lego figures each week, or saving up for several months to buy a larger toy, like a PlayStation.
You could consider rewarding your child in some small way when he does save money. For example, if your child saves up enough money to buy a PlayStation, show him that you are proud of him by offering to pay for have of the PlayStation (however, do not mention this until your child really has saved up enough money to buy what he wants).

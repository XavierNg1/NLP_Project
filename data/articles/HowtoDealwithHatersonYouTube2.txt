 When ignoring the hater isn't an option, approaching the user directly may help alleviate the jealous tension. Try this conversation starter:


"I appreciate your constructive criticisms, but at times, it can come across a little harsh. Is there anything I can do to help promote a working environment?"

, This means that you should try not to address the haters if he/she decides to continue nagging at you despite your "address" comment.


Also, beware that even though you might feel the nerve to type something negative right back at the hater, this is not very productive. It only raises tension between you and the user.

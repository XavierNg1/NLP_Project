 Here are some things you could try together:


Take a Zumba class.
Make an elaborate dinner together.
Go away to a new place for the weekend.
Drive a couple hours to an especially beautiful hike.
Learn to surf.
Volunteer at an animal shelter.
Take a photography class.
 Designate a period of time (it doesnâ€™t matter how long or short it is!) when you and your boyfriend promise to focus only on each other. Cook dinner together, watch a movie, or just talk about your day at school or work. Making time for one another is an important way of strengthening your relationship.
 Make your partner feel loved and respected. Effective communication is key to any good relationship. Here are a few questions you can ask that will create productive conversations for you and your partner:


"How can I help you?"
"What do you love about our relationship?"
"What 'little things' can I do to show you I love you?"

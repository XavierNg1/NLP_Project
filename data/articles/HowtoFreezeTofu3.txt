 Take the frozen tofu from the freezer several hours before you plan to cook it. Leave it out on the counter in the airtight container, and allow it to return to room temperature. If you properly pressed your tofu, then it should be much firmer and chewier once it has thawed., If you are in a hurry, then you can quickly thaw tofu by zapping it in the microwave for 30 seconds to one minute. The tofu will turn a bright yellow color; almost like amber. This is completely normal.

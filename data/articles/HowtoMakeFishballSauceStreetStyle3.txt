 Take 4 or 5 fried fish balls and thread them directly onto a long bamboo skewer. Serve several of these skewers with the dipping sauces on the side for people to choose what they want.


You can serve the sauces in small bowls next to the skewers or in squeeze bottles so people can squirt sauce onto the skewers or their plates.
 Cook a package of ramen, udon, or soba noodles according to the packaged instructions. Drain the noodles and place them in the bottom of your bowl. Once you've fried up the fish balls, set them over the noodles in your dish and drizzle them with a sauce of your choice.You should eat the ramen and fish balls as soon as you can. The noodles can make the fish balls soften and lose their crispiness.
 If you'd like to make the fish balls into a more substantial meal, serve the fish balls alongside cooked rice or a few pieces of flatbread. You could also serve them with a side salad.You can drizzle or squeeze the sauce over the fish balls and rice.

 Choose colors that play well against your hair color and wardrobe. Look for berets with tight brims so they'll stay on your head. Consider whether you want a thinner, lacy beret for spring and fall or a thick beret for winter.;
, You can wear your hair in almost any fashion with a beret, depending on what kind of look you're going for. If you choose a bun, make sure to place it high enough to fit inside the beret, or low enough to sit below the band. You can also do a low side ponytail or two low plaits on either side of your head. Wearing hair loose with a few large curls makes for a glamorous 1940s look.
 Show your hairline or don't. Place it in front of your ears or behind. Figure out what looks best for you. Remember that berets are traditionally worn a little lopsided. Have fun with it! Here are a few specific looks you can try:









Tuck in the brim of the beret and tilt it to one side, pulling it low over your forehead. This looks good with a low side bun or plait on the non-tilted side of the beret.
Untuck the brim of the beret and allow a little air into the hat, to create a mushroom effect. Place this on top of your head, pulled over the ears and tilted to one side, if desired. This style looks best worn with loose straightened or curled hair.
Pad out the front of the beret using a silk scarf or cotton wool to give it some lift. Set it back on your head so the front of your hair is exposed. Secure the rest of the hair at the back of your head with a loose bun, or tuck it under the beret. A finger wave or fringe roll gives an added vintage effect., If the beret seems too plain, or if your outfit needs some jazzing up, add a broach, flower pin, or bow to the hat. Bold earrings are another option. Make it your own.
 Use crisscrossed bobby pins on the hair close to your temples to secure the beret on both sides of your head. A slipping beret can mess up your hair or fall off, ruining your careful styling.

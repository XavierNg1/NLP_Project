 You won't be able to fix all poking wires this way, but this method will help in many cases.Find the wire in your mouth that is poking you.
If it is a thin wire, get a pencil with a clean eraser.
Gently touch the eraser to the poking wire.
Push the wire gently to bend it.
Try to tuck the poking wire behind the arch wire.
Only do this for thinner, more flexible wires.
 Sometimes, eating hard foods can cause flexible wires in the back of your mouth to slip out of the bracket slots on the back teeth.If this occurs, you can try to fix these with tweezers.
Get a small pair of thin nosed tweezers. Make sure they are clean before using them in your mouth.
Grab the end of the poking or loose wire with the tweezers.
Guide it back into the tube on the bracket slot.
If you can't get the wire back into the slot, you will need to call your orthodontist.
 You will need to see your orthodontist to follow up for a replacement.If the wire lacing of your braces is broken in the front of your mouth, you can try to tuck the broken lace behind the arch wire or around a bracket.
Use tweezers to bend the wire away from your lips and cheeks.
If the lace is on top of the arch wire you can can also remove it by cutting it with pliers. This is only recommended as a last option and should be followed by a visit to the orthodontist as soon as possible.

 The skin and wound area must be completely dry before liquid bandage can be applied. Pat dry with a soft towel to avoid disturbing the wound.If the wound is bleeding, stop the bleeding first before applying the bandage. Press the wound with a towel and hold the pressure until the bleeding has stopped.
You can also press an ice pack wrapped in a cloth or towel over the wound to reduce blood flow and stop the bleeding.Elevating the wound above the level of your heart can also reduce bleeding.Liquid bandages should only be applied over minor wounds, such as superficial cuts, abrasions and scrapes that are not deep and do not bleed heavily. If the wound is deep or bleeds heavily for over 10 minutes (regardless of attempts to stop the bleeding), seek medical attention immediately., Use a spreading motion from one end of the wound to the other. Use one continuous movement until you have covered the wound completely.If the wound is a cut, bring the edges of the wound together with your fingers to help seal the wound.
Do not place the liquid bandage inside the wound. It should be applied only on the surface of the affected area.
 This allows the adhesion or bond between the bandage and skin to develop.


Do not apply another layer of liquid bandage over the old one after it has dried. This will loosen the old bandage.
 Although it is waterproof, you should not let it sit in water as this will remove the bandage. You can still take a shower or go swimming as long as you are not soaking in the water for an extended time.Do not apply any lotions, oils, gels, or ointments over the affected area. This will weaken the bond between the liquid bondage and your skin.
Avoid scratching the site as this may remove the liquid bandage.
The liquid bandage will fall off naturally in 5 to 10 days.

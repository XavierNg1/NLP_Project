 Sketch a circle that’s a little flat at the top and narrow at the bottom. Right in the middle of the circle at the bottom, draw a line about one-third up. Then draw two small circles, one on each side of the line, for the puppy’s nostrils.
 This is the puppy’s snout. Next, with one of your fingers, trace from the middle of one curved line up until it looks just right, and draw a circle for the eye. Do the same thing on the other side. Color in the middle of each eye for the pupils, leaving a little white area at the bottom.
 Once you have an idea, make an oblong shape for the head. Sketch it in using light, pencil strokes. If you see that it’s a bit off, simply erase and lightly sketch it again. It sometimes takes a few times to get certain areas you are drawing just right.
 Sketch it right underneath where you made the two curvy lines for the snout. You can either give the puppy a long, drooping tongue or with just the tip coming out. Both are cute.
 The wide part will be at the top and the pointy part will be at the bottom. Though don’t make them pointy. Make it a soft triangle. With multiple strokes, draw in some curvy lines for a droopy chin. Keep it in proportion to the entire head though. Then draw in a couple lines to give the puppy some wrinkles.
 The puppy is sitting on this side; that’s why it’s larger. Starting on the right side, draw a line down from the puppy’s snout, then up and around on the other side of the body. Next, sketch out the front paw. You can’t see the other paw, so just add a few curvy lines to indicate that it’s there. Add a pointy tail, and there’s your cute puppy.

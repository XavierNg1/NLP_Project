 Locate the app icon of a chick on your device’s home screen or app drawer; the icon also has Zynga’s logo of a dog. Tap to launch the game.
 After opening the app, go to the Settings option by tapping the left side of your smartphone. From the drop-down menu, select “Settings.”

, Do this by checking the “Enable Feature” checkbox next to the “Community Friends are here” option.
 After enabling the feature, you will be suggested to other players as a community neighbor. When you run out of money or energy in the game, a “Get more free help and free gifts” pop-up will appear with two options: “Not interested” and “OK.” Tap “OK.”


Once you tap “OK,” you will see a list of Community neighbors with their pictures and an “Add” button at the bottom. Tap “Add” to add these Community neighbors. Once you add them, they will be displayed at the bottom of your game screen.
 When someone adds you as a Community neighbor, you will get a notification in the game. Tap this notification, and accept the request. This will also make that person your Community neighbor.

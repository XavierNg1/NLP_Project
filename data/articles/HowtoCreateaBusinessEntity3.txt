 States generally place restrictions on the words that may or may not be used in the name of a corporation. Generally the name must include the word ‘incorporated’ or ‘inc.’ or some other indicia that the business is a corporation.
 The initial board of directors is composed of those individuals in charge of getting the corporation up and running. They will authorize the issuance of stock and pick officers of the corporation, two of the most important decisions the corporation will make.
 These are usually called articles of incorporation and are generally accompanied by a filing fee. Your state’s secretary of state or department of state office will likely have an approved form that you may fill out or you may draft your own. Articles of incorporation generally include the name of the corporation, its address, and the name and contact information for a person to whom members of the public can contact regarding that corporation.
 These are analogous to the operating agreement that an LLC operates under. Corporate bylaws will include additional information such as how shares of stock will be voted, how directors are chosen, etc. Usually you may use a template for the bylaws or draft your own.
 At this meeting the initial board of directors will adopt the bylaws, elect officers, authorize the issuance of stock, and determine how to handle certain financial or tax issues such as the corporation’s fiscal year.
 In order to officially be a corporation you must issue stock, as this formalizes the division of the ownership of the business.

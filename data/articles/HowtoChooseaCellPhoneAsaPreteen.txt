 Verizon and AT&T are the best working ones. Sprint, T-Mobile are not as quick and good. Look at other people's phones and ask what they think of their networks.;
, Go on the network's websites. Browse phones. But carefully. Ask yourself questions: Do I want a sliding keyboard? A touch screen? A flip? A camera? Video? Color? Music? Texting? Internet? AIM? Email? 4G, 3G? Video chatting? So many questions!

, Talk to your parents about what their price range is. You should have them look at it with you, to make sure it is okay. If it is not, don't cry. Look in a different price range. There are lots of great phones out there.
 If you go and get it at the store, the people who work there will help you. You can get unlimited texting, minutes, whatever. Be sure that you really like it.
 Get your friend's numbers and add them in contacts! Text, call, video chat! Have fun with the games on some phones. Turn it off at school, if you are in class.
 There are lots of awesome, cool, cases. Look online or at the store and see which one you like!

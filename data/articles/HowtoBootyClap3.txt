 Similar to the other methods, your feet can be at a normal stance less than shoulder width apart. However, if you feel more comfortable take a slightly wider stance. In this case you might have four(10.16 cm) or five inches (12.7 cm) of space between your feet., Use your calf and thigh muscles to rise up on your toes. So, shift your weight to your toe box and balance there. Hold on to a wall or chair to help you balance if necessary.
 As you do this, your chest should poke out. If it helps, think about making a curve in your back that looks like a C. Stand in front of a mirror, and readjust to make sure you don’t look awkward. Your movements should look natural.
 Then, move them up again. Continue to bounce as you do this. After you move your hips down, they should almost naturally spring up again because of the momentum. Then, repeat the motions -- pelvis down and pelvis up. Bounce as fast as you can, and you should hear your butt cheeks clap together. You know when you’re doing it right when your butt cheeks make a sound like they are clapping.


Use your body weight and the slight bend in your knee to help you create this bouncing motion. When you move your pelvis down, bend your knees slightly.
Your arch in your back should help you be mindful of rotating the pelvis instead of just using your legs.

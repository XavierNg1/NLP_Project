 A dispersal agent is like a carrier, except it helps spread the oil through the bath. You can use an agent such as honey, milk, or vegetable oil. If using vegetable oil, you should use a fluid oil, such as sweet almond oil or jojoba oil, that will disperse easily through water, not a thick solid oil, like coconut oil. About 2 to 12 drops of essential oil can be added per teaspoon of carrier., Warm water will help you relax, which will also assist in relieving your constipation. Warm bathing has also been found to relieve certain side-effects of frequent constipation, such as hemorrhoids and anal fissures.
 As you are adding water to the bath, add in your oil mix. Adding the oil near the water spout will help circulate the oils throughout the bath. You may also gently swirl the water with your hand to encourage the dispersal of the oil.
 Bathe for 15 minutes to a half hour. Not only will the oils soak into your skin but you will inhale the scents as you relax. The bath may loosen your bowels. If you need to use the toilet, be careful not to slip as you leave the bath.

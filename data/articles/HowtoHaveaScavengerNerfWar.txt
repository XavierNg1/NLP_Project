 There should be at least 2 to a team, and two teams versing each other. Also, this is a critical part- you need to have one other person, sort of like a ref, if you will. Their job will show up later on in this article.
 Keep in mind that a player can only carry two weapons at a time, preferably your primary and secondary., Remember, it's very important the players don't see the ref placing the weapons down. Then, place the ammo down, either next to the guns, or not, whatever you prefer. Also, place down a small gun, like an N-Strike Reflex, along with all of these guns. This will be the medic gun, and so if someone on your team gets shot down, you can shoot them with the medic gun to revive them. Note, the medic gun can only be used twice per team in a game, so use your revivals wisely., On either side of the field, with the Nerf guns being fairly well hidden, and sort of in the center of the playing area, have the ref start the game. The goal, essentially, is to be the first team to find the weapons and target the other teams. Once the game is done, tally up the "casualties" and start the whole thing over again.

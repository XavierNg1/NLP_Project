 If you are unsure what texture you have, look up images: orange peel, knockdown, and popcorn online. Spray texture for orange peel is available in small aerosol cans at your paint center. Some manufacturers include an adjustable nozzle to help you match the desired look and thickness. Test on a scrap piece of drywall to develop your spraying technique, as this can be tricky to get it right. Don’t hold the can too close to the repair area or it may begin to look clumpy.


Soak the can in warm water for several minutes and then shake well for easier application.
To produce a "knockdown" effect, use your finger to apply little blobs of wet all purpose drywall compound in random shapes and patterns trying to match the existing pattern as close as possible. Let the blobs dry for about 10 minutes before lightly dragging a wide drywall blade over the slightly wet blobs. Never attempt to use a spray can for this type of texture, you won't be happy with the results. Note: The correct way to apply this texture is with a professional texture sprayer, available for rent at big box supply store. However you can get pretty close with the finger method. Wait 24 hours before applying paint or primer.
 One coat probably won’t be sufficient, as joint compound tends to soak up paint and create an unfinished look. Apply both primer and paint with a roller if at all possible, since paint brushes may leave brush marks. Home centers have small foam rollers for such repair work that are cheaper and easier to clean than larger rollers.
 This may only take a few hours, but it’s preferable to wait overnight.

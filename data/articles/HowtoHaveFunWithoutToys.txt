 Think about what you like, or like to do. Do you like animals? Does being a doctor or a fireman or an astronaut sound fun to you? Get some ideas of fun things you would do or be right now if there were no limits at all. Maybe you could role play being another character or creature. Or draw images of these things or make plans for becoming someone famous one day. Let your imagination run wild.;
, Do you normally play inside or outside? Is it safer to play inside? Do you have a big yard or park? Do you have your own room or do you play in the main part of your home? See what you have to work with and then mix your make the most of what you do have.

If indoors, you can make a fort or a pirate's ship out of lounge chairs. Imagine you are sailing the high seas or flying a plane. Make use of the furniture around you. Borrow items from the kitchen to make a noisy percussion band and create a concert for the rest of the family to hear in the evening.
If you can play outdoors, you can still play games of imagination. In addition, you can make a fort, throw around balls such as a tennis ball or a soccer ball and you can use chalk to draw pictures or make games on the ground, such as hopscotch. Use your body's skills such as running, jumping and skipping to create fun games.
 Naming your games makes them easier to remember so you can play them again and again. Once you have created your own games, they become an important part of your creativity and deserve to be remembered and played again. Some games thought up by children are set out under "Tips".

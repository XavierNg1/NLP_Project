 The windshield wiper lever is a long lever, straight or angled, located to the right of the steering column. If you have trouble locating your wiper lever, consult your vehicle maintenance guide or contact the vehicle’s manufacturer.
 When you pull the windshield wiper straight back and away from the steering column, two parallel streams of windshield wiper fluid should eject onto the windshield.If your windshield wiper fluid does not come out when you pull the windshield wiper lever, or if it only comes out in a weak stream, check the level by opening your hood and locating the wiper fluid tank. Refill it if necessary.


If your windshield wipers do not work, bring your automobile to your local car repair shop and get them fitted with new wipers. You could also try to find the right windshield wipers yourself, but make sure to check your vehicle’s maintenance guide beforehand so you get the right length.
 When you think the windshield has received enough wiper fluid and has been scrubbed adequately by the windshield wipers, release the lever to stop the cleaning process. If your windshield wiper fluid leaves streaks or smears behind, consider refilling it with a different variety after exhausting the current supply. Alternately, you might consider investing in a new pair of wipers. Consult the staff at your local auto care shop for advice pertaining to your vehicle.


Windshield wiper blades should be changed regularly every 2 to 3 years.
If there is some buildup on the wiper blade itself, try wiping the blade down with rubbing alcohol or mineral spirits.

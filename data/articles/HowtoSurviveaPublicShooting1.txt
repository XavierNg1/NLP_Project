 It's natural to panic in an emergency like a public shooting, but panicking causes people to react emotionally rather than thoughtfully.It may seem impossible to keep calm during an emergency, but there are a few things you can do to remain level-headed.


Focus on your breath. Count to three while breathing in, hold your breath to the count of three, then exhale to the count of three.You can (and should) do this while moving to safety, but controlling your breath can help you from hyperventilating or making rash decisions.;
, Once you realize that there is an active shooter situation, you should alert others nearby. Some people may not have noticed that an incident has been unfolding, while others may be frozen with fear. Announce to everyone else around you that you believe there is an active shooter situation, and that everyone needs to get out or hide., It's imperative that you have a plan in place of what to do in case of an emergency. Training and preparation can help you escape to safety, but remember to always have a backup plan. If you can't follow your primary plan, evaluate whether or not you can follow your backup plan., Many people freeze up in an emergency. If a shooter is active, you may feel the urge to remain still and hide. However, experts advise that hiding should only be an option if you cannot safely escape.If you know of an escape route that will keep you at a safe distance from the shooter, resist the urge to freeze up and force yourself to run, as long as you can do so safely.

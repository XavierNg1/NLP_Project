 Leeks are generally ready to eat when their stems are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. However, if you have a taste for young leeks, they can be harvested at any time. Younger leeks are less flavorful but they are more tender, and may be eaten like scallions.


You can leave leeks in the ground until they get quite large if you don't want to harvest them all at once. Plan to remove them all before the ground freezes in the fall.
 Keep the roots intact when you harvest the leeks. Use a spade to dig around the base of the leek, then gently pull on the leaves to remove it from the ground.
 The leeks will need a good scrubbing to remove the soil from their stems. Wash away all of the dirt using a vegetable scrub brush.
 Leeks can be stored in the refrigerator if you plan to eat them within the week. Wash and dry the leeks and place them in a plastic bag or in your vegetable crisper. When you're ready to cook them, remove the roots and the green part of the leaves, and process the white portion of the stem to use in a recipe.


For longer-term storage, keep the roots attached to the leeks and trim back the leaves until just 1 inch (2.5 cm) of green remains. Store them upside down in a wooden box, and back them with sawdust. Place the box in a cool cellar for up to 8 weeks.You can also freeze leeks. Remove the roots and leaves and blanch the white stems. Place the blanched stems in freezer bags and store for several months.

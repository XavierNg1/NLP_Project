 Your tires are only able to do one hundred percent of one thing, so if you attempt to brake and turn simultaneously, you could lose traction in your front tires resulting in understeer. You can avoid this issue by braking prior to the turn so you are less likely to lose grip.You are more likely to lock up your tires if you are turning and braking at the same time.
 Understeer is more likely to occur when there are other elements limiting the amount of grip available to your tires. Situations like heavy rain, snowfall or ice can all limit the traction of your tires and increase the likelihood of understeer.When traction is limited due to road conditions, drive slower and carry less speed into turns.
Follow posted speed limits and pay attention for signs indicating a change in road surface.
 An easy way to avoid understeer situations is to follow the old racing rule, “slow in, fast out.” That means to approach corners slowly, then accelerate out of them. This method will prevent you from being taken by surprise by steeper turns than you expect.When driving in unfamiliar areas, approach corners slowly, then accelerate once you know you can handle them.
Roll onto the accelerator slowly as you accelerate out to avoid causing understeer inside the corner.
 If you come into a corner slowly and realize you’d like to go faster, you may be tempted to accelerate quickly through the remainder of the corner. Remember that your tires traction will be compromised if you ask them to accelerate and corner simultaneously.Add throttle gradually as you turn to maintain traction in the tires.
Front wheel drive cars are more prone to understeer as your accelerate because you may get front wheel spin if you give it too much gas.

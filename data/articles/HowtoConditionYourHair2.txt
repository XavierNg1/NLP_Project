 You don’t need to deep condition more often than this; in fact, deep conditioning too much can actually damage your hair and cause it to break more easily. Once every week and a half or two weeks should be sufficient. You know it’s time to deep condition when your hair feels a bit dry, or the ends seem ready to split.
 There are hundreds of store-bought deep conditioners to choose from, and salons offer deep conditioning treatments as well. However, if you don’t want to spend money on a deep conditioner, you can use household ingredients that are just as effective. Here are a few deep conditioners you probably have on hand:


Coconut oil (unrefined)
Olive oil
Mayonnaise
Almond oil

, Use a little less if your hair is short, or a little more if your hair is long. Apply it near the roots and comb it through your hair to the tips, making sure every strand gets covered. A wide-toothed comb is a great tool for the job, or you can just use your fingers.
 This will trap your body heat against your head, gently heating the deep conditioner and helping it become more effective. Plus, it will keep the conditioner from getting all over your clothes and furniture. If your hair is long, you can put it up in a clip, then cover that with a shower cap.


If you don’t have a shower cap, use plastic wrap or a plastic bag pinned around your hair.
Be sure to use something that’s nonporous, rather than porous material like a towel or t-shirt that will let the heat escape.
 An hour will be enough time for the deep conditioner to penetrate your hair and work its magic. If you have time to spare, you may keep it in your hair for several hours or even overnight.
 In some cases you may need to shampoo two or three times to rinse it all away. This is especially true with coconut oil and olive oil, which are both very rich oils that aren’t easy to wash out. Wash your hair until it no longer feels as though it’s covered in oil. When you dry your hair, it will silky and bouncy.

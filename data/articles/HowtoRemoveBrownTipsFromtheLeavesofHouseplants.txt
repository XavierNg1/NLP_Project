 Leaves with small brown areas along their edges or tips are fairly common even on healthy houseplants. Because a large portion of the leaf is still green, it is still producing energy for the plant through photosynthesis. However, if a leaf is almost entirely brown and dry, then it is better to remove the leaf entirely by plucking it or cutting it away.;
, Brown tips can be trimmed easily using a regular pair of scissors. For the best results, you should use as sharp a pair of scissors as possible. Very sharp blades minimize damage to the plant's cells, which reduce the amount of energy it must spend healing the wound.
 Use the scissors to clip the brown leaf tips away. It is best to leave a very small sliver of the brown area remaining on the leaf. In doing this, you will avoid opening a fresh wound in the plant's leaf, which will stress the plant and may eventually turn brown itself anyway.
 If you have a compost pile or municipal composting program, you can add the leaf tips to your compost. If you suspect that the houseplant is diseased, however, avoid potential contamination of your compost and discard the leaf tips in the trash.
 Of course, if you take steps to improve the plant's health, you may be able to prevent it from developing discolored leaves in the first place. Brown leaves can be a sign of both over- and under-watering, inadequate light, or excessive salt in the plant's soil. Take steps to address these potential problems and note any changes in the leaves' coloration.
 There is no way to keep these shedding leaves from gradually turning brown, and they can be clipped away once they are thoroughly discolored and dry.
 Check the soil and the undersides of the leaves for insects to help diagnose the problem before it gets worse.

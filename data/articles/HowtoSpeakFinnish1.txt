 Finnish has a heavy emphasis on vowels, and its alphabet contains some vowels that are not used in English. Before you start studying Finnish, you should learn how to read and pronounce its alphabet. Since Finnish words are spelled exactly how they are pronounced, this will help you learn vocabulary more quickly.


A (IPA: /a/): pronounced like English “father” or “calm”
O (IPA: /o/): pronounced like the 'o' in 'bot' or 'top'.
U (IPA: /u/): pronounced like the English 'a' in 'all'.
I (IPA: /i/): pronounced like the English 'i' in 'fit' or 'tip'
E (IPA: /e/): pronounced like “bed”
ä (IPA: /ae/): pronounced like English 'a' in "hat”
Ö (IPA: /ø/): pronounced like English 'i' in “girl”Y (IPA: /y/): Like the 'oo' in 'too'. Similar to the German “ü.”A double vowel in a word simply means that you pronounce it for twice as long.;
, Most consonants in Finnish are pronounced the same as in English. This includes the pronunciation for the letters D, L, M, N, NG, P, S, and T. The letters B, C, F, G, Q, X, and Z are only used in loanwords.There are a few differences between English and Finnish consonants. These include:


Always pronounce H. Your H should sound breathy, as though you are puffing air every time you pronounce it.
J is pronounced like “y” is in English.
V is weaker in Finnish than in English. As you pronounce it, try touching your teeth against your bottom lip very lightly.
A double consonant (such as in the word takka) is pronounced with a brief pause or hesitation between the two consonants.
W and X are not used in Finnish., It is good to have a stock of simple phrases you can use to say hello and goodbye to people. Practice repeating these phrases back to yourself. You can also listen to videos or audio clips online to help you get used to hearing the language as well. Some good phrases are: Hei: hi, hello

Moi: hello (informal, used with friends)

 Numbers are important to help you find and buy things while you are in a Finnish speaking area. After learning one through ten in Finnish, you can attach endings to make numbers 11-90.one = yksi
two = kaksi
three = kolme
four = neljä
five = viisi
six = kuusi
seven = seitsemän
eight = kahdeksan
nine = yhdeksän
ten = kymmenen
For numbers 11-19, all you have to do is to add the word -toista in the end of the finnish number between 1-9. (eleven= yksitoista; twelve=kaksitoista; thirteen = kolmetoista, etc.)
For the numbers 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90, just take a number between 1-9 and add the word -kymmentä, at the end. Example: Kaksi (two) + -kymmentä = Kaksikymmentä, which means twenty in Finnish.

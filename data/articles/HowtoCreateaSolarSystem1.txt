 You'll need a hula hoop, fishing line, lightweight balls in various sizes to be the planets and Sun (the smaller they are, the more realistic the distances will be), paint to customize the balls, and tape.


You can use lots of different items to be the planets. You can make them out of foam, styrofoam, papier mache, toy balls, clay, yarn, or any other material you can access.






Just try to make sure that the balls are as light as possible, as the hoop might not be able to hold heavy items.

, You will be tying 4 sections of fishing line around the hula hoop. Begin at one side of the hoop and cross directly over to the other, looping around the edges and tying the ends of the line at the center. The line should be taut. Do this until the 4 sections of string split the hoop like a pie or cake.
 Paint your planets or otherwise make them look how you want them to look. Remember to pay attention to the different sizes and colors of the real planets!

, Cut 9 equal lengths of fishing line to however long you want the Sun and planets to hang. Tape or glue one end of the string to each of the planets and Sun, and then tie the other end of the string to each of the 8 sections of fishing line on the hoop. The Sun gets tied at the center, where all the lines meet up. Adjust the planets so that they are closer or further away from the sun.
 Tie a loop of fishing line to the center of the strings so that it can hang or find another way to hang your solar system. Enjoy! You are now done!

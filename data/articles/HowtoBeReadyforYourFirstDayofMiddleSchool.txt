 When you buy supplies, think of every class you might have and what you will need for them. Write down everything you can think of. Your list should include pencils, pens, paper, a binder, a calculator, notebooks, planner, etc.


Check the school's list if there is one––buy what it requires, otherwise you'll have to buy extra things later.;
, Go to orientations (open house) and talk to all your teachers. If you can, it may also be a good idea to meet the principal. While you are at the school, make a mental or physical note of where each class is located.


In some schools, if you ask, you can get a map of the school. If you do get one, write down the name of each class and the teachers on it. Study it before your first day of school so you know where everything is.
 You don't want to be late for class because you didn't know your combination or what class to go to.
 The night before, make sure that everything you need is in your backpack. This will keep you from forgetting anything in the morning.
 Doing this gives you one less thing to worry about in the morning.
 Have a binder that you keep all of your important papers in. If you have anything you don't need, don't keep it in your locker or backpack. Write anything you need to remember in your planner.
 On the morning of the first day, stay focused so you aren't late.
 Reach out to others and get to know everyone. Some of those people will become firm and fast friends, so be friendly and ready to connect.

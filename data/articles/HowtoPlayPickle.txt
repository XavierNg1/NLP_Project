 The more, the better. Why four? You need two ends and at least two runners. You could have one runner, but the game would become boring very quickly. If you can't find a tennis ball, another small ball that is not to hard will work fine.;
, You need two bases about thirty yards apart on the ground that multiple people can stand on. You can use a baseball plate, draw a circle with chalk, a sewer lid on the street, or anything else that works as a base.
 Pick two people to be the ends. Each end stands near, but not on, one of the bases. During the game, they will throw a tennis ball back and forth to each other, trying to get the runners to run.
 The rest of the people are the runners. The runners run back and forth between the bases while the ends try to hit them with the ball. When they are touching the base, the end cannot hit them. They can stay on a base as long as they want. In the beginning of the game, the runners stand in the middle of the playing area. The ends throw the ball back and forth three times, then play begins and the runners run to a base. They can leave the base whenever they want to go to the other base, or, go back to the original base. When a runner is hit or tagged by the ball off a base, they get an out. After three outs, the runner becomes an end. The end that recorded the final out becomes a runner.
